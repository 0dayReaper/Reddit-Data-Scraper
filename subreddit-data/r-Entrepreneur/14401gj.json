    "postText": "A small dream of mine came true recently.\n\nI stopped becoming someone that makes excuses for why I can't do something and finally created an app that's actually helpful to everyday people.\n\n[skipit.ai](https://skipit.ai) \\- Summarize youtube videos, PDF's, social media posts, and websites with just a link.\n\nI've always wanted to work in tech and build apps of my own, but didn't know where to start. And that overwhelming feeling of needing to learn a bunch of new concepts that were completely foreign to me made me give up before I even started. And even if I would get started, any obstacle that would come my way would make me want to give up.\n\nBut ChatGPT made everything quick and easy, and was able to explain it in ways I can understand.It even helped me stop performing some bad habits I have whenever I try to become productive.\n\n\\- No more endless scrolling trying to find answers to every little question. ChatGPT answers 95% of them.  \n\\- Helped me accept that I don't need \"perfect systems\" before starting. I used to always have to watch every how-to video, plan every step in my notes, and watch motivating videos to get me mentally ready.  \n\\- I've accepted to just start with what I have and get 1% better every day after.  \n\\- Not giving up after 1 hour of productivity. ChatGPT can always help you move onto the next step, so seeing the potential of progression keeps you motivated.\n\nI never would have been able to build anything if it weren't for ChatGPT. I would still be doing marketing services for clients, which is great and still helping business owners, but doesn't give the internal satisfaction as building something on your own that you know helps people who may need this exact thing.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to build something on your own, even if it's not tech, see if ChatGPT can help you.\n\nMy first question to help me get started on this was: \"Is it possible to build an app that takes links to youtube videos and lets users ask anything about the video?\"\n\nAfter it said yes it was possible, I asked \"How can I get started on this?\"\n\nIt then lists the steps a complete beginner would need to take. Such as creating accounts, where to write code, etc.\n\nYou can even ask it to write the code for you by asking \"I would like to build this in Python (A very beginner friendly coding language), can you please start writing the code for me?\"\n\nAnd you can build momentum from there. If you have any troubles, let ChatGPT know your problem and it'll most likely find a solution.",

Rod Serling would approve.\n\n&gt;\"Is it possible to build an app that takes links to youtube videos and lets users ask anything about the video?\"\n\nEternally the wantrepreneur will ask what is possible and fixate on potential. Entrepreneurs concern themselves with what is probable and focus on actuality.\n\n[Build It And They Will Come](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/143zpec/what_to_do_next_after_the_app_prototype/jncwafe/?context=3) as the solution is [no solution at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mupm4w/comment/gv8mh4q/?context=3). And it is what every 'just do it' retort in a forum is about: Getting Exactly What You Ask For ...good and hard. Or the plotline of every Twilight Zone episode.\n\nFolks, this is the genie let loose from the bottle. Where, with a snap of one's fingers, due diligence vanishes as if it had never existed. AI has [a pernicious focus](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/us-military-drone-ai-killed-operator-simulated-test) the people using it fail to consider. No, wait .... AI has \u201chighly unexpected strategies to achieve its goal\u201d. At least AI doesn't 'procrastinate' about achieving the mission objective. Far from it.\n\nWell now, that sounds better. I'm sure operators everywhere are reassured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIL We found something much better than giving teenagers whiskey and car keys. Oh joyous day. \"It wasn't me, I was just following AI orders\" LOADING ...please wait for hilarity to ensue.",

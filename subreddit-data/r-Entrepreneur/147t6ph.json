    "postText": "Hey, i\u2019m 17 turning 18 next month and have 3 months off for summer until i get back to my final year of school. I am looking for a job but no immediate success so far, I have been approached my a lady who is a landlord and rents out her house, and she is looking for me to do some handyman work and maintenance for that house, she found me from a facebook post I put up looking for some work locally.\n\nI am meeting her in 2 days and will be able to hopefully clarify more what she is looking for and how well I will be able to meet her demands, it\u2019s not full time work, but she said can be long term. Regarding my own experience, I am interested in construction/carpentry/woodwork, i have done a little bit of work experience with a carpenter, and some small wood projects myself at home. I am eager to learn more as it could be a possible career for me.\n\nMy main question is about pursuing handyman work as a side job during the summer and possibly even into the future depending how it goes. Although I don\u2019t have a massive amount of experience in a wider sense, I am very willing to learn and i can see the importance of knowing how to fix/make things on our own around the house which I am sure others can too. I am not in the US, so i don\u2019t have access to apps like craigslist/nextdoor, but i do think Facebook community groups and using my own contacts/referrals could work if I put time into it. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any help, thank you",

At your age I was networking with local friends of friends, picking up odd jobs on weekends, afternoons and summers. Usually helping an older guy who had the knowledge but needed someone more limber. Then you expand. Write some Facebook or Craigslist listings, proudly talk about what you do. I got a consistent gig from a friend of a failed tinder connection. It\u2019s all about representing yourself as motivated and responsible. Then apply for maintenance jobs, or better yet go to local contractors and see if they\u2019re looking for guys. Never appear like you need the job. Remember you\u2019re doing what someone else either doesn\u2019t want to do, or can\u2019t do themselves. Be interested, but not desperate.\n\nLastly, always YouTube what you don\u2019t know. I still do this regularly, there\u2019s a ton of info there.",

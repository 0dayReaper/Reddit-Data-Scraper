    "postText": "Hi everyone. My sister in law is starting a new linen and bedding business in a small european city. Her family fled from a communist country when she was about 15 years old and had to start working right away so she doesn\u2019t have an education and isn\u2019t very tech-savvy, I\u2019ll be helping her with her website. \n\nI have experience in graphic design and marketing, so I can help her with that stuff, I just don\u2019t have any experience with an e-commerce website. \n\nWhat e-commerce website builder I should use for her website? Do any have easy marketing features built-in?\n\nIt would be nice eventually if she could take care of the website stuff herself, so I want it to be easy for someone who has no experience with stuff like this to be able to learn. \n\nAny advice is highly appreciated!",

You\u2019re acting like you just made this post to argue.\n\nMy point was that if you can\u2019t figure out how to set up WooCommerce, you\u2019re better off paying somebody to set up your online store. If you can\u2019t pay someone to do a basic task like this you\u2019re probably not positioned to run a company.",

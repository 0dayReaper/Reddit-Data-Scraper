    "postText": "Recently I dealt with a company who sold and installed solar panels on my house roof. Everything went so difficult straight from the moment they took downpayment. They redo three times, damaged roof so badly it has to be replaced. Didn't acknowledge the issues until I did the expertise and started talking with them through lawyer. I said, if you don't pay it in full I will make this story public. They just laughed. Finally they offered to cover about two thirds of the damage they made and I accepted because going through court would take another 2-3 years and I had a deadline coming to get government subsidy. It was a bitter and they knew it, so didn't offered full amount. Still I had multiple thousands of damage to cover by myself. Now I briefly mentioned their shitty job on facebook group and they replied immediately with pikachu face, said we covered 100% bla bla. Why their reputation suddenly started to be important for them? Should I make this whole story public and help somebody not to choose their shitty service?",

And small business, generally speaking, is run like a comic third-world dictatorship.\n\nIn Asia you go into business to honor the customer. In the United States you 'fire your boss' to go into business. Imagine the shock and dismay to find the customer sits in the cushy chair you had your ass all set for.\n\nTake a look about one-bad-review posts here, and especially YELP. Not one time will a business owner own up to the crappy service they provide or a fucked up product. It is always some disgruntled ex employee ... a devious and jealous competitor ... A Vast YELP CONSPIRACY!\n\nSome former YELP employee did an AMA here. My question was who uses YELP as a tool in a continuous improvement initiative. He couldn't remember a single instance in his years with the company.\n\nMore recently somebody asked about quality assurance procedures. Over the next three months, keep an eye out for anything even remotely about total quality or anything resembling a quality based approach.\n\nI've listed my own problems dealing with dinky business. If you just give them the chance, they are quite proud to suck. The entire 'em-vee-pee' movement is using the term as an excuse to suck. Being a half-ass is part of the popularity and you will read posts declaring you should suck so badly you feel embarrassed to launch.\n\nNotice in posts just what is favored and what is shunned here.\n\nA horrible start may be acceptable if you ever intended to improve -- then busted your ass improving immediately. Most find it a comfort and intend to get away with the least they possibly can.\n\nPeople whip out there bliss then play with it in public. The only thing a potential customer can do is file the obvious restraining order. While the hype says entrepreneurship is full of noble, ingenious, customer driven pioneers the truth is a disturbing lot of entrepreneurs are common lowlife bastards.\n\n[What Consumer Complaints Reveal about the Solar Industry](https://campaignforaccountability.org/work/what-consumer-complaints-reveal-about-the-solar-industry/) but of course, none of those complains are from real customers.",

Admitting your fuckups goes a long way. People gotta be narrow-minded though. And the company in OP's post is just like that.",

This means that these companies potentially have a huge wave of remedials, repairs and servicing coming up behind them that they will certainly not have factored into their pricing.\n\nSo their business plan will only have 2-5 years. They'll go bust and phoenix with another brand and identity before long ( if they haven't already )  so no, they almost certainly won't care much about reputation.",

I live in the Seattle area and storage and parking is atrocious here, but there seem to weirdly be a ton of always closed off parking garages. \n\nIve always wanted to turn half of a structure into reasonably priced storage units to help store everyone's extra items because of Seattle's tiny apartments and the other half into decently priced vehicle storage. Tons of apartments dont even have parking options included in the lease and you have to fight over minimal street parking. Anyway, I thought creating a gated car storage would be helpful and possibly thought about incorporating a lot attendant to not only watch the units, but to be on call to drop customers vehicles off at their residences when called upon. \n\nThe Tacoma area has a lot of closed out parking structures that seem vacant as well and I think would make an excellent repurposing space to help vehicle congestion in our city.

            "comment": "I started an app development company with my wife about 7 years ago (we're both software developers by trade). Originally started out on iOS and have since expanded to macOS, Android, and Windows. We're currently doing around $800k/year in revenue, expenses are minimal ($1k/month or so on servers) so most of that ends up our bank account at the end of the day. (A big chunk goes to taxes of course.) Hoping to break the elusive $1M/year in 2017.\n\nOur main product is a niche consumer-oriented utility app that you've probably never heard of. Unfortunately we've had enough clones of our app (like, literally multiple people have cloned it screen for screen), that I don't really want to invite more clones by publicly naming it here (especially after mentioning our numbers).\n\nIf you told me 7 years ago that I'd still be working on my own products as an app developer in 2017, I would probably have been shocked. Every year people keep telling me \"there's no money in apps anymore\", but every year we've broken that trend and continued to grow in revenue. It doesn't look like it's stopping anytime soon.\n\nSo far we've done almost zero marketing. (We did some banner ads on popular app sites a few years ago, but gave up on it because we could never make the ROI work out. Part of the problem was lack of attribution tracking at the time. I've been meaning to try again with Facebook ads but haven't found the time to experiment yet, we're still very much focused on development right now.) At this point I think the app spreads primarily through word of mouth, many of our users *really* love it, and they share with their friends, who share with their friends, etc.\n\nI read a bunch of other startup/small business related forums and I get the impression there's lots of other folks out there like me, quietly working on their own products and making a pretty good living out of it. Here's another great thread to read through on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13326535\n\nP.S. It's really cool to hear everyone's stories and see the creators of sites like examine.com and camelcamelcamel post here. Glad to find out this place isn't just about dropshipping, affiliate marketing, and maid services.\n\nEdit: Incidentally, I think this is one of the best threads I've ever seen on this subreddit. Just people telling their stories in a really wide range of fields. No weird sales pitches or thinly-veiled marketing attempts. This is what we need more of.",

It's a shopify site and similar model to all the send X to X sites, but our operation is a lot different due to some fairly complicated logistics.  \n\nI am based in Bamako, Mali's capital, and my friend Ali, a former tourist guide, lives in Timbuktu. With Ali, we have a group of unemployed guides in Timbuktu that handwrite the messages on the cards and take them to the Timbuktu post office. We get the postcards stamped at the post office, but then send them down to Bamako ourselves, either on public transport or on United Nations flights (the sole clerk at the post office in Timbuktu has told us it could be weeks to get it to Bamako if we go through the Malian postal service). The final stop is the Bamako Central Post Office before the postcards leave the country for their international destination. 60% of the profits go to the guides, who are unemployed because Timbuktu has been a red zone since 2012. There are no tourists, and the town is still dealing with serious insecurity. \n\nThe postcards take anywhere from 2 weeks to a couple months to arrive at their destinations. It's definitely not for the impatient, but we have found plenty of customers who enjoy the idea of receiving this physical object that has traveled an incredible distance from a place that some people don't realize actually exists (we actually had someone write to the site who thought we were just making a fake Timbuktu stamp to mess with recipients. He thought Timbuktu was imaginary and just something people say.) \n\nStarted the site last year and cracked 1000 orders towards the end of 2016, mostly thanks to a BBC article that came out in December. We have now teamed up with a schoolteacher in Timbuktu, and her students are hand drawing postcards, which is a new option on the site. Those cards cost $2 more and the $2 goes directly to her classroom.  At the end of the day, we've been able to send a good amount of cash to Timbuktu, and we have sent postcards to over 53 countries.

Then I expanded to helping them edit their essays and other English documents for grad school and charging a lot more. Now I work with them (and their parents... that deserves another post in itself) basically with anything and everything that gets them from china to the us. So, someone will come to me saying that they want to go abroad for study, and I will help them select schools, then select their major, then help them brainstorm and edit their written materials, and after acceptance (hopefully) I work with them on their visa interview.\n\nIt's honestly a really rewarding experience. And the money is pretty good with next to no costs... most Chinese institutions will charge $10,000 (USD!!!) per student, and after they take in the money, they basically do the bare minimum. I charge a slightly higher fee, and give them my utmost attention.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to be a white guy who can speak Chinese, with a wife who went through the exact same situation my students are going through. As for advertising, I do everything 100% word of mouth through an app called WeChat. I offer my students 10% off if they help me repost an advertisement. I still make my money, they're happy because they saved money with minimal effort, and I get more potential clients. It's a good deal all around.\n\nI'd love to do an AMA on this, but not sure if there is enough interest. It's a somewhat niche industry I'm in, but a niche industry in china still means millions of potential customers.",

I'm a bit new here and mostly lurk, never saying much because the culture here seems to be more about making money and less about a quality product or service.\n\nI started out as a bookbinding instructor at a local non-profit and some students started asking to purchase my example books. I tossed around the idea of becoming a seller and joined Etsy sometime in 2014 but didn't really do anything with it. \n\nLast year in January (2016) I decided to really give it a go. Since then, I've been putting in a lot of work learning about SEO, promoting, creating a brand for myself, taking good product shots, setting up a standalone site, etc. etc. I also approached local businesses and museum gift shops about carrying my books and even sell some in person when people pass by my bookbinding studio. \n\nBetween Etsy, my standalone site, and local sales, I pulled in about $3000 dollars last month. To be fair, it was a good month. I consider this a part-time gig, though I am registered as an LLC. I still teach and work at the non-profit.\n\nIt's been A LOT of work, and there's a lot more to do and learn. It's tough to do every last bit of everything yourself, but nothing is better than being able to bind books in my studio all alone with some good music or Netflix on.",

For a hobbyist just starting out I offer something a lot more reasonably priced, without resorting to the garbage cast iron units that Harbor Freight sells.",

I am an owner/operator, with no employees.  This is a side gig, I have a full time desk job.  I work, on average, 15-20 hours a week cleaning.  I just bought some new equipment and a newer van, so now my costs are about $1000 per month.  I make that in about 2 days.\n\nI have zero marketing costs, and everything I do relies on word-of-mouth and very satisfied customers.  I have enough commercial work to keep up income but prefer high-income residential.  All told, someone could get a solid start in this business for $20k and if I were full time, no doubt I could bring in 6 figures a year, even in my small town.",

Although the service is completely free, we offer a few extra features to users who donate $5 or more to the site. My philosophy has always been to make people fall in love with your work *first*, so that their purchase is one they make out of happiness/gratefulness/goodwill, rather than the money feeling like a paywall.\n\nWe have about 150,000 users. I recently quit my desk job and moved to the middle of nowhere, where rent is really cheap, so the donations we get helps me cover the rent while I work on new projects.\n\nWhile I'm not an expert at coding or web design, I think my greatest skill is looking at a specific community and understanding the kind of things they want the most, and delivering that to them. Then, once people see my project with some degree of legitimacy (rather than me being the typical \"idea guy\"), it attracts the interest of more expert developers or other specialized people who can take it to the next step of professionalism. That's what happened with FFZ (I don't do much coding anymore) as well as some of my new projects I haven't announced yet.",

I do R&amp;D, manufacturing, bottling, labelling, fulfillment, customer service, the whole shabang - with the exception of the logo and label design, which I used a freelancer for, the entire business is a one-woman show.\n\nI started making skincare products without any goal to sell them, I just missed being in a chem lab so I set one up in my kitchen and played around with recipes I found on the internet. I started perfecting my recipes, got my blog followers to test them out and give me feedback, and ended up with a couple products that I thought were effective and unique.\n\nI created an LLC, got all my ducks in a row, and launched with just those two products. I only spent about $3k pre-launch, so I broke even within the first two months. I still have my regular day job, but my skincare company makes enough that I could leave my day job if I wanted to (but I really love my day job - bummer, right?).\n\nI owe a lot of my success to two things:\n\n1) Finding a niche and staying true to it. My company is all about science-based, no-frills, unfragranced, gimmick-free, hyper-effective skincare. While there are a few beauty companies out there like that, it's a much less crowded market than if I were trying to do luxurious, high-end skincare or all-natural, organic skincare or trying to keep up with the latest skincare trends.\n\n2) Genuine engagement with my customers. I was a science-y skincare blogger long before I launched the company, and I still write blog posts/post on Reddit about skincare in general, without pushing my products. I regularly post behind-the-scenes chemistry photos from the lab to my Instagram. I figure if people are interested in what I'm selling, they're probably also interested in the general science behind skincare, so I focus on that rather than pushing a sale.",

I made one for my son in 2003, started doing them for friends/family occasionally, then in 2007 decided to make it a business! Built my website myself (Frontpage at the time, lol, have since upgraded to Wordpress) &amp; just used basic SEO to get it ranked on Google (I had a job in SEO at the time.) Got my first few orders by posting on my local Craigslist... and over time it just organically grew to where it is a full time job for me and a part time job for my sister (and I really need to hire a second person!) I do basically everything myself, from web design to marketing to social to accounting to product creation, and my sister helps me with prepping the clothes. I have created almost 1000 quilts at this point, and have about a year's worth of orders pretty much on an ongoing basis. People send me their stuff from all over the globe - all over Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, UAE - I even had a man fly to me (I'm in Phoenix AZ) from Luxembourg with 3 suitcases of his kids' baby clothes because his wife didn't trust the postal service. I am lucky enough to get to work from home, and was able to stay at home with my kids when they were little, and this year I should make right at about $50,000. It's a lot of work - no dropshipping here, lol - and it's not like I'm getting crazy rich, but it is absolutely my passion and I feel pretty great about what I've created from literally a $10 domain name purchase! Bonus: no daycare for my kids. And I've probably listened to well over 500 audiobooks in the last decade while sewing, along with hundreds of podcasts. And multiple Harry Potter movie marathons. ;)",

            "comment": "Started a web development and online marketing [company](https://www.cyberbytesinc.com) 7 years ago when I was a freshman in college with a business partner (my step dad). He ran a construction company full-time and was my first/primary client.\n\nWell, 4 years went by while I was getting a triple major in college that had absolutely nothing to do with my skill (web development). Brought on a few clients over the years but really didn't make much at all. Worked a lot and payed myself like $5k/yr for those 4 years.\n\nI was an introvert, enjoyed sitting in-front of a computer all day and worked well by myself. My business partner wasn't going out and networking and marketing so no new business was coming in. At that point I was managing $35k/yr in advertising budget for my step dad's company, but I was charging him hourly at like $30/hr when working on the campaign and website. It didn't amount to much.\n\nAnother year went by with minimal growth and I decided to make an ultimatum, if nothing changed a year from then (2 years out of college) then I would have to totally rethink things and consider getting a job somewhere. (I never worked for anyone aside from my step dad's company).\n\nAnother year went by, got a couple bigger clients (big for me at least, like a $4-5k website). But still, not enough growth or sustainable work.\n\nI'd go to networking events, nothing came from it. I'd usually just hang out with a few friends and not really talk to many people. I was in my comfort zone. Then I'd just complain afterwards that my business partner was supposed to be sales guy anyway, it wasn't my responsibility and I sucked at it!\n\nIt was at that time that I broke it off with my business partner, he was supposed to be the sales leg, but he was working 70 hours a week at his construction company.\n\nThis brings me up to about 8 months ago. So just over 6 years in business and bringing in $5k/yr and the most recent year $11k. Working my ass off, teaching myself web development, doing personal projects, working tons of hours but not many of which were billable.\n\nBut it was at that point when I broke it off with my business partner that I decided to go out to networking events and actually force myself to talk to people and sell myself. It lead to a few promising leads and eventually a sale. It was then that I realized I was using him as a crutch. He was \"sales guy\" so I didn't have to be. In my mind at least. But I was a \"sales guy\". I was passionate about my service and knew it like the back of my hand. I started networking and talking to people. Using others as soundboards to figure out and refine my service offerings based on engagement.\n\nStarted backing away a bit from web development and more toward the IT side of things. IT consulting, software implementation. Stopped trying to be an asshole artisan putting small businesses on $4-10k websites and instead using SquareSpace and Shopify when it made sense to just pop out a $800-1.5k site.\n\nWeb development became my foot in the door, but I was clearly becoming an IT company. I positioned myself that way and transitioned my existing clients over to it. I joined local advertising organizations and didn't go there as advertising guy. I went there as IT guy and problem solver guy. I met my current best client there. A 25 person advertising agency. I pushed them to take a chance on me, gave them a phenomenal deal to get my foot in the door. They just axed their IT guy 6 months prior so they had some work outstanding that needed to be done.\n\nI didn't know how to do a lot of the work, but I figured it out. I pushed myself, got tons of mentors in the IT space, asked them for advice constantly.\n\nStarted building up recurring revenue from clients and figuring out a direction. Closed out 2016 by tripling what I did in 2015, all by myself. Still a 1-man team. But now I know my service offerings and I know where to focus.\n\nI'm hoping to double in size this year and wholeheartedly believe I can do it by myself. I've finally passed the point of making \"minimum wage\" and it finally makes sense to keep on pushing.\n\nIt's tough, it's a struggle. I'd re-evaluate things at least once a year and it got old real quick. \"Just one more year\" I'd tell myself, but nothing would change. Had close family asking me when I was going to move on from this and get a \"real job\". That killed me. They meant no harm by it, it was a very valid and fair point. I did want to prove them wrong, but more, I wanted to do what was right for me.\n\nI still continue to work my ass off. I think about my business 24/7 and haven't had a meaningful relationship (girlfriend) in 4 and a half years. My business took precedent. It gave me highs, it gave me lows, and I learned to equalize things. When you have super high highs, you're going to crash and burn and have the shittiest lows. It's not sustainable or healthy. I just learned this in recent months. Now when things are going well, I think about the negatives, and vice-versa. Keep myself equalized.\n\nAnd no, I'm not making the best money just yet. BUT I am finally seeing solid growth happening 7 years later. I've grown professionally but also personally. I'm now super outgoing, people can't even fathom that I am an introvert deep down. I now love meeting new people and building relationships. I am excellent with sales and selling myself because I'm just being fully transparent, honest, and passionate. Refined my business to focus on [Business Process Automation &amp; Efficiency](https://www.cyberbytesinc.com) with IT Support as the foundational service. (P.S. site is pretty outdated, haven't updated copy in a while. Little to no business comes from my website so it has hit the back burner. It's tough to sell what we do with text on a page.)\n\nIt's working well and I'm figuring out my niche.\n\nIt took 7 years making no more than $5k/yr for most of them. Living at home WAY too long. But I finally feel like I've made it and so excited for the years to come. I wouldn't want to be doing ANYTHING else right now.\n\nI wouldn't trade any of it for anything. I am a totally different person now. If things took a turn for the worse and I had to close up shop, I don't care. I've learned so much and grown so much as a person. Not to mention, the various mentors I have built over the years have told me there would always be a job waiting for me. While it's a nice safety net to have, it's definitly my last resort. I'd rather continue fighting building my own thing even if I don't end up making more than $50-60k/yr. I'm happy and love having control of my future. That alone is worth it over making a guaranteed $80k/year + benefits.\n\nIf it isn't already clear, money is not at all my driving factor right now, never has been. If it was, I'd have thrown in the towel a LONG time ago.\n\nThere's two things I want to stress:\n\n1. Get mentors. A LOT of them. They are invaluable given you show them that you aren't afraid of some hard work.\n2. DON'T start a business because you're chasing money. If money is your driving force, you're going to give up before you make it.\n\nIf this post can help even one person, it will all be worth it to me. I know I haven't \"made it\" yet, but I already feel indebted to all my mentors and the need to give back just as they did.\n\nCheers!\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE:**\n\nSo I've been getting tons of DMs and questions and have already spent hours replying to so many people individually. I mean I was just talking about my story and the CRM bit seems to have struck a cord with many people here.\n\nThere's a lot of repeating I'm doing in DM's and in here so it's probably much easier to reply in mass. I mean I do specialize in business automation and efficiency and all! haha\n\nI'm going to put together a boutique 1:1 newsletter where I will talk about this stuff in more detail and I can probably be much more help. You can also reply to it and talk to me directly if you have any specific questions.\n\n**[Business Automation &amp; Efficiency Newsletter Signup](http://cyberbyt.es/newsletter)**",

So by day I run product at my startup, but we have a few other things we do to hedge our income. \n\n1. My wife and I started an affiliate review site 18 months ago that brings in $750-1,500 month. We do one article a week, focusing only on things our family uses. It's not going to make us rich, but it helps cover the mortgage. We work 2-3 hours per week on this. My wife does most of this, as she's a great writer and has a little background in SEO.\n\n2. Etsy - we sell very niche letterpress posters on Etsy that sells $4-5k month. Our profit all out is about $2-3k per month. Our COGS are not cheap, and we spend about 2-3 hours a week in the evenings on this, mostly on fulfilment. Again, not F*ck You money, but it helps. \n\n3. Mobile App - I'm a product guy, and designed and built an app that we apply into multiple niches. Right now it's about bring in revs of about $6-7k month, but my dev partner and I are putting most everything back into the company. So right now I pull nothing from it, but I anticipate that by may it should be $3-4k month in income for me.  \n\nMy main income is still my VC backed startup, but my wife and I have been working really hard to build a steady baseline because income stability in my line of work is not the best. None of it has been easy, and definitely not a 30 day turnaround, but they're just the kind of low maintenance businesses we need. ",

I used to spend lots of time reading info on how to do stuff that I actually never took action and that's what's wrong with many of us. Just execute on your idea ... do anything reach out to people, send emails or dm's on instagram to your potential clients, try and get a sale today! You don't need more info telling you how this has to be perfect before launching! Go do it now and be ready to fail, fail and fail again.

Calculating child support is basically a formula, but it's complicated enough that most people don't want to do it by hand (especially lawyers). Plus, I add in a few features for estimating income tax if the other parent hasn't provided any information. I'm totally self taught, so it's really nothing fancy.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really bad at promoting the sites once they launch. I tend to write some blog articles and then hope that they drive enough traffic to get some customers. But, despite that I made about $20k last year. I spend maybe 2 hours a month responding to emails and help requests, but largely they run themselves. Developing the sites can take me a while, but I enjoy doing it and chalk it up as time spent on my hobby.",

Lots of investment upfront in equipment (I've been at this since 2004) but it's just he and I working.  Very competitive field.  Very hard to compete against larger shops with bigger equipment/more people.  So we focus on a niche.  We make enough to support ourselves, but not quite enough.  Eventually hubby will have to stop printing or hire a younger person. It's physically hard to print shirts.  \nI'd love to hire sales, grow the business.  Because right now we are word of mouth.  I have great customer service. Deliver on time and never ever surprise anyone with an invoice charge they weren't aware of at beginning.\nSide Note:  Weekly, we get the call/email \"I saw this shirt on Etsy, Teespring, TeeChip, etc. etc  Can you just print me one shirt....for $8\".  No buy it from said site for $15 and quit being a cheap ass.  From me you'll pay about $25 for that one shirt, not including the artwork fee I'm going to charge for recreating someone's funky fiverr text graphic design.\nAggravating.",

When I saw the kind of treatment seniors and computer illiterates get from Geek Squad and the like, I realized I could provide a much more personal service. One appointment that solves their problem with minimal fuss, no condescension, and lots of patience for their questions earns a loyal client. If you treat clients like family, they love your business. Who woulda thought? :)",

    "postText": "I'm thinking of starting a home management business, primarily geared towards wealthier, older folks. I live in a \"zoom town\" that is very popular with the wealthy and older crowd. I was thinking of starting a business geared towards helping people with bill pay, coordinate house repairs, run errands and my wife would do home modification consultations (she is a geriatric home health physical therapist).\n\nI'm NOT looking to do caregiving. Although I know that's in high demand, it's a different can of worms I'm not interested in at this point. Thoughts? Does this have merit? I don't want to go through all the hoops of starting a business only to find out there's no demand.",

            "comment": "You can do a test of the market in an effort to measure the demand. You can and should do a feasibility study. I feel a bit like a broken record but that is the only real answer. You can do it yourself, or you can hire a professional. DM me if you are interested the initial consultation is free or you can use this basic format to DIY the idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal is to draft an Executive Summary that briefly describes your business idea, the market, and the main conclusions from your feasibility study.\r  \n\r  \n\n\nDescription of the Business\r  \n\r  \nBusiness Idea: Describe your home management service in detail. Explain the services you plan to offer (bill pay, house repairs coordination, errands, home modification consultations, etc.) and how they will meet the needs of your target market.\r  \nBusiness Goals: Define what you want to achieve with this business in the short and long term.\n\n\r  \nMarket Feasibility\r  \n\r  \nDescribe your target market. Who are they (wealthy, older individuals)? Where are they located (your \"zoom town\")? What are their needs? \n\n  \nMarket Size: Estimate the size of your target market. How many potential customers live in your area?\n\n\r  \nMarket Trends: Identify trends in your market. Are more wealthy, older individuals moving to your area? Are there trends in home management or geriatric care that could impact your business?\n\n\r  \nCompetition: Identify your competitors. What other businesses offer similar services? How will you differentiate your services?\n\n\r  \nTechnical Feasibility\r  \n\r  \nIdentify the resources you'll need to start your business. This could include office space, a vehicle, a website, etc.\n\n\rOutline how you will deliver your services. Who will do what? How will tasks be completed and services be delivered efficiently?\n\n\r  \nFinancial Feasibility\r  \n\r  \nEstimate the cost to start your business. Include all initial expenses such as licensing, equipment, initial marketing, etc.\n\n\r  \nEstimate your potential income. How much will you charge for your services? How many clients do you expect to serve each month/year?\n\n\r  \nBreak-even Analysis: Calculate when your business will become profitable. How long will it take to recover your initial investment?\n\n\r  \nFinancial Risks: Identify potential financial risks. What if you don't attract as many clients as expected? What if your costs are higher than anticipated?\n\n\r  \nLegal Feasibility\r  \n\r  \nLicensing and Regulations: Research the legal requirements for your business. Do you need a license to offer these services? Are there regulations you need to comply with? Home repair, does that make you a contractor? \n\n\rDetermine what types of insurance you'll need to protect your business. Cost of licenses, permits, registrations ect.\n\n\r  \nBased on your research, is this business idea feasible? Can it succeed in your market?\n\nIf so, proceed to step 2, testing the market. \n\nYou have already identified the Target Market: wealthy, older individuals in your \"zoom town\". You need to understand their needs, preferences, and behaviors.\r  \n\r  \nConduct Surveys or Interviews: Create a survey or interview script with questions about your service. Ask about their current solutions for home management, their pain points, and their thoughts on your proposed solution. You can use online survey tools or conduct one-on-one interviews.\r  \n\r  \nRun a Pilot Program: Offer your services to a small group of people in your target market. This could be friends, family, or acquaintances who fit your target demographic. This will give you a chance to test your services in a real-world setting and get feedback.\r  \n\r  \nAsk for Feedback: After your pilot program, ask for feedback. Did they find your service useful? Would they be willing to pay for it? What improvements would they suggest?\r  \n\r  \nAnalyze Your Competition: Look at similar services that your target market may be using. How does your service compare? What can you offer that they don't? What will set you apart? How are they marketing their services, compared and ontrasted against your marketing plan. \r  \n\r  \nMarket Testing: Consider running online ads targeting your demographic, with a call to action leading to a landing page where people can sign up for more information. This can give you a sense of the level of interest in your service.\r  \n\r  \nEvaluate Results: After gathering all this information, evaluate whether there is enough demand for your service. If the response is positive, it's a good sign that there's demand in the market.\n\nGood Luck and have fun.",

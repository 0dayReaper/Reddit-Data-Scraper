    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm seeking some advice here, and appreciate this may not be entirely the right audience but would value your input nonetheless.\n\nI work for a large global bank in a front office department. This bank is far less sophisticated in its approach to portfolio optimisation - something I'm familiar with at other places I've worked.\n\nIn my spare time over the past year I've been developing a desktop application built in python which would enable this bank to optimise its portfolio in a manner similar to that of other larger/successful organisations. \n\nSince this has been a substantial effort on my part I'd like to sell this application to my employer but appreciate this would come with many complications and hurdles to overcome. \n\nBefore I begin conversations internally I'd be keen to hear if anyone here has experience doing something similar, or if others have any advice I'd also love to hear this. \n\nThanks!",

Check with a local lawyer specializing in intellectual property before approaching them, if that's the case.",

So licensing per user or as a managed service doesn't appeal to me, but maybe licensing volume of usage or a set percentage of revenue based on how this factors into their bottom line, etc",

Money saved and/or additional revenue generated \u2026 this can help put a price on your proposed solution. Always sell on value.\n\n&gt;This bank is far less sophisticated in its approach to portfolio optimisation - something I'm familiar with at other places I've worked.\n\nSeems like you come to the table with valuable experience attained from previous employment, so\u2026\n\n2. Will you provide the solution as an employee or an external supplier/contractor? The external supplier/contractor typically gets a better return on their efforts.\n\n3. Consider structuring your compensation on a recurring fee or licensing instead of a one-off sale.\n\n4. Is the solution only applicable to your current employer or can it be productised and sold to other organisations.",

For that reason I've had it in my mind to structure it as a recurring license fee. \n\nI think your most interesting point is the second regarding my employment status. In an ideal world id like to retain my current position - I get paid well and enjoy my job, however I'm just not sure if that would be possible. Could it be possible to set up a licensing contract with the startup entity providing the product, while I retain my position at the organisation? Things that might not permit it could be conflict of interest related, although I'm not sure any exist. Would be keen to hear your thoughts on this.",

            "comment": "**Perhaps you can do these three simple things:**\n\n1. Get users to try out your product and see if the solution produces the results these users are seeking (learn, revise, and invent)\n2. Understand the Business Process (or SOP) in which the bank requires for an App to be purchased and adopted, along with the decision makers of that App and their specific concerns e.g., end-users (App features), IT (security &amp; compliance), finance (company budget) - this can be an opportunity to learn about their concerns and hence what you need to prepare\n3. How to operate that App to the standards of the bank (as per its SOP), you may need to start gathering the core team, create a company (so that you can enter a purchase and service agreement with the bank)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh yeah **don't forget to calculate costs and expenses**, here might be some things you might want to take a look at when calculating the cost:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Variable or semi-variable --- incurs when you have customers paying or users using the App e.g., App hosting (as more users use the App, the higher the hosting resources need to be used to run the App smoothly and hence the higher the cost)\n2. Fixed --- incurs regardless whether you have customers buying or users using the App e.g., employee expense, marketing expense, office rent expense if any\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPay attention as well as WHEN you will be receiving the payments after customers purchases that, say, if you offer an ERP App priced at $10,000 per month, your business customer may pay that 30 - 90 days later. But if you offer an Productivity or Specific Functionality App at $500 per month (say, users pay $10 each and there are 50 users who will be using), your business customer may pay today or before they are given access to use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue is a service delivered and invoiced (may not be paid)\n\nCash inflow is the cash transaction occurred on your transaction (is paid, regardless when the service is delivered and invoiced to customer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue today MAY NOT result in receiving cash today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAssuming you bootstrap your own Startup, you might want to have a goal of obtaining a POSITIVE CASH FLOW as soon as you can while being able to keep the business running.\n\nFor example, if you have cash to run the business for 12 months from today, you might want to target getting a POSITIVE CASH FLOW at the 5th or 6th month\n\nPOSITIVE CASH FLOW = more cash is getting in from REVENUE than it is getting out from COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What matters urgently in the early days is that you have ENOUGH CASH TO SUSTAIN THE BUSINESS**\n\nAlso, KEEP IT SIMPLE, don't make what you do soooo complicated you don't want to continue doing it haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope these little tips can help.\n\nGood luck! Must be exciting..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind regards,\n\nCommander Cody",

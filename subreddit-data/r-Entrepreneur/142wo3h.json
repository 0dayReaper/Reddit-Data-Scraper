    "postText": "Hi! \n\nWhat are some types of businesses that tend to come across as boring and struggle to keep people's attention?\n\nFor example, some SaaS companies might sound too technical. And I used to write funny social media copy for Incfile (business incorporation company).\n\nI'm trying to get a better idea of the sorts of businesses most likely to be interested in my services (funny copywriting). \n\nThank you!",

I don't want to say what the idea is exactly. I've spoken with randoms in YouTube and twitch chat as well as a couple streamers and 8 out of 10 like the idea and would use it.\n\nI cannot create this on my own and will need to hire developers to help me. I can get a very basic MVP up, but it will be very simple and dumbed down.\n\nIs there a book or course I can take/read on how to go from this idea, to taking steps in making it real, along with getting investors to help? Not even sure how I could find an investor. I'm just a programmer. Help. Thank you.",

You could validate this by instead creating a basic site with a newsletter sign up That is positioned as \u201cjoin the wait list.\u201c In the meantime, you can be sending content to your audience to build credibility and use the volume of sign ups to gauge whether or not you actually have a product idea that has legs.\n\nHowever, when you get to the development stage, I would highly recommend Marty Cagan\u2019s book inspired, which talks about startup product management and going from idea to wire frame to high Fidelity prototype to MVP and validating your product along the way for useability and value. It\u2019s a great read. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I had the exact same problem! And it took me over 2 years to take the plunge and do somehting about it.  \n\n\nI built a prototype with the help of GPT (no previous coding experience) - it helped me use Python, HTML, CSS, AirTable, and an open banking platform. I then showed this prototype to an engineer, as well as a mentor in the tech space. The mentor in the tech space backed it with $$$, and the engineer is now 1 month away form launch - we have over 600+ users on the beta waitlist.\n\nWhat I found is if you want to build it, you need to bootstrap it and find a way to build a prototype or mvp yourself. A) It will show your willingness and relentlessness to take control, and B) investors will believe in your vision if they see you have grinded to get it off the ground. And the third, when an engineer builds it, you will have more than a basic understanding of what is required, which will break down the tech language barrier.\n\nOnce you take the plunge and do it yourself and control your destiny, you open up a whole new workdl. I've started writing [The CHampions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe) in my spare time, building my tech start up form the ground up (we now have a team of 6 from 0 just 6 months ago), and have planned to start a podcast. If you told me I would be in this situation 6 months ago, I would not have believed you. But, action breeds motivation. So take action, figure it out, and watch your world and doors open up",

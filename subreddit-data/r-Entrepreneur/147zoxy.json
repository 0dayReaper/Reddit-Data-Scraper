    "postText": "Hey, How do you guys cope with knowing once you pitch an idea to someone like an investor that they can then duplicate your business idea without you. I know I can have people sign NDA\u2019s but let\u2019s be honest there\u2019s work arounds around that. This is hard. I need partners but once I share a business plan they themselves can duplicate or slightly modify it for themselves and cut me out.",

There is no point of stability, certainly not safety.\n\nRather I see it as a defensive reaction to being unable to compete or adapt. If just anybody hearing your napkin scribble can rip you off, there is no 'moat,' no barrier to competition.\n\nYou don't get a no-compete zone to launch, nor breathing room to grow. First casualty of this type of thinking is all forms of proper market testing; because guess what, the customers aren't signing your NDA. Cut off from the market, you just self-sabotaged your venture.",

Amazon Basics is [nothing but the best selling products of vendors](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/), since Amazon has that data.\n\nThe patent is just a poor attempt at a monopoly, the very no-compete zone from my first post. I often tell people patents are like bullets, useless without the gun: A court battle.\n\nConstant, relentless innovation rather than sitting on the patent -- you obsolete your own product as competitors are busy copying what you were doing. Obsession with understanding the customer and airtight product-market fit. Rather than what everybody REALLY does, which is suffer from inventor's syndrome and market blindness.\n\nWell that sounds like work. Can't have *that*.",

The problem is I don\u2019t have time to work, try things, fail, iterate, and motivate others to follow my vision. \n\nInstead, I\u2019d look for a great leader and SME who had the time/motivation where I don\u2019t. I\u2019d look for a valid idea THEY cared about and were willing burn the midnight oil to get it off the ground.\n\nIs it impossible for a developer or investor to steal an idea? Not at all, it could happen. But IMO, you\u2019d be much better served putting your idea out there and getting feedback, validating it, identifying others who are interested in helping, etc. than you would be worrying about the unlikely chance of an investor/others stealing it. And if that does happen, use your motivation and work ethic on another idea.",

I would bring in deal flow primarily and review deals. \n\nI've also had multiple bootstrapped companies (1 i sold, a few i still own) and have also worked at a Venture backed startup. \n\nPushing an NDA prior to telling your idea is naive. There is no value in your idea. There is value in your execution. Therefore it's naive to put the emphasis on the idea. \n\nWas Sam Walton the first person to come up with walmart? Were the Wright brothers the first to think about flying? Did Elon Musk come up with the idea for electric cars?\n\nPeople know about these people because they executed. \n\nChances are you're not the first person to come up with the idea that you have. If you think you are you may want to try some humble pie. \n\nAs a VC I would review hundreds of pitch decks. When I would meet with companies many thought they had an amazing idea that was going to change the world. I appreciated the energy but the reality is at least 90% of them have failing ideas that may seem great but won't work. That's just the reality of the situation, most businesses especially VC backed businesses fail. \n\nTherefore stop placing so much emphasis on your idea. \n\nWhat you may want to consider instead is coming up with multiple ideas and testing them all within staggered 48 hour periods and see what the market actually responds to. Then when you have some traction double down and then start believing in your idea more. if you read any business strategy publication like; [trends.co](https://trends.co), [explodingideas.co](https://explodingideas.co), etc strategy is everything. this has always been the case in my experience as well. \n\nwithout an impactful strategy that actually resonates with the market, you have an idea which is essentially worth 0.",

It\u2019s got the same black tea they use in a regular Thai iced tea. But individual plastic packets (like Ketchup) of condensed milk which is normally just sold in annoying cans.\n\n* a smartwatch that\u2019s designed similar to those slap bracelets from the 90s. With a flexible OLED screen.\n\n* A New format Cinema experience. A single screen. A small bar area is the main foyer where people can drink and order small plates. Then there is the living room space, patrons will relax and hang out until they are ready to start the movie. The single screen space. Can be customized for your group preference. Lights on, dim, typical theatre set up. Chairs, beds, benches, or even flat no furniture just foam mats or blankets. The space is rented out in blocks.\n\n* Simple app - on normal calls, insert audio file of various classic phone sounds before actually hanging up. So the person on the other end of the line can hear things like \u201cphone being slammed onto receiver\u201d or \u201cthe click\u201d from the 80s/90s or the \u201cerherherherherh \u2018 If you\u2019d like to make a call, please hang up and dial again\u2019 \n\n* an online store that exclusively sells international snacks and chips\n\nI want these things to exist. I would fund them if I had money. I would make them if I had time.\n\nThe reality is, your amazing idea is a few things:\n\n* probably not even amazing\n* probably not even a viable business / product\n* probably someone else\u2019s amazing idea as well\n\nBut finding out for certain if it\u2019s possible, if there\u2019s a market, if YOU can make the idea a reality? Almost nobody is gonna do it let alone steal it from you.\n\nI\u2019ve seen businesses get stolen. One of them was pee.\n\nLiteral piss.\n\nThere was a guy who ran a bunch of small businesses. One of them was urine testing for small rehabs. He secured a contract with a rehab. Once the contract ran out, the guys who ran the small rehab decided they could not only internalize that part of their facility, they could probably go to the same small rehabs their original contractor was talking to and offer to do their urine testing as well.\n\nIt was kinda sad. This guy had found a need, filled it, and was not only putting food on the table, he was using his profits to create other small businesses and incubate a few other people\u2019s small businesses. \n\nThese guys running a rehab realized it was way harder to run a rehab then it was to test piss. Instead of wanting to expand their rehab, they ended up wanting to be big in the piss testing industry. The only reason that business was able to be stolen, wasn\u2019t because the idea was novel. It was because the actual business and profits were proven.",

It happens all the time.\n\nTherefore, it is unwise to say \u201cno one will steal it\u201d or \u201cno one cares\u201d. Rather, the sound advice would be that you should leverage whatever legal and tactical methods you can in order to protect your idea.\n\nFirst, getting a strong patent is a huge plus. Also, have folks sign NDAs when you demo your idea. Remember that you will ultimately need to take legal action to enforce an infringement.\n\nFurthermore, you should always be mindful of who you share your idea with, even with NDAs and patents. If I were you, I would not share it with anyone who has the acumen to copy your idea unless you know you really trust them. Furthermore, only show your idea to people who will add value to your business, such as qualified customers and investors.\n\nTo answer your question directly\u2026 it can be a scary thought that your idea might get stolen, but do your best to stay strong and proceed with discernment as you strive towards success!",

You are also already activity doing the business so they would need extra time to catch up, giving you competitive advantage even if they did try to copy you.\n\nIn option 2, let's pretend you want to start a t shirt business. Obviously those exist so you would have to be killer at maybe branding or marketing or quality.

I've reverse engineered products and built literal exact copies from scratch with nothing more than a sample product.  There is nothing stopping me or anyone from doing this.  Funnily this was a customer owned design where the same customer had us do it.\n\nWe have seen copies of our designs sold all over the world for a decade.  There's usually a number of small changes here and there, but the whole construction and location of parts, and so on are the same.\n\nNow does this worry us?\n\nNot really, for two reasons.\n\nOne, generally the copy is often not as good as the original because there's almost always a lack of understanding of why something was done.  A copy lacks the understanding that came from the development, the compromises, the engineering, the optimizations.\n\nFor example, that reverse engineering I mentioned above?  Well the design was kind of garbage in several ways.  It technically worked, but there were a lot of shortcomings, lack of understanding.  These products were not engineered well.  They were not optimized well.  They were wasteful in an array of ways.  And they compromised performance due to an array of bad choices.  There was one product that we did for a customer where I literally threw away the design completely, did a clean slate redesign from scratch, and ended up offering the customer a vastly superior product in so many ways.\n\nTwo, when you start working with customer, I mean really building relationships, you will find that the product is almost secondary to the character and culture of the company and how you approach that partnership.  Even personally, I've seen many competitors lose business to us because they simply didn't want to be good partners with their customers (for whatever reasons they deemed important).  We picked up so much business from people that fail spectacularly at this.  And funny thing...  Customers will stick with you through thick and thin because they believe in YOU.  They want to be a partner with YOU.  The product is just a tool, a device that supports their operations.  But 90% of this game is people.  It will bring you great success or could end your entire business depending on which way you view your customers.  It is AMAZING how strongly this drives success in the market space, and it's something I can't stress enough.  This is also why a competitor can simply copy and expect to succeed.",

More likely is the multitude of other people who have already had this idea either tried it and failed to execute it because it was a bad idea, or it was a good idea and they just couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t see it through. \n\n- This is important to remember so you don\u2019t get hung up feeling violated at the thought of someone else stealing \u201cyour idea.\u201d \nBy that logic in the 99.99999% likelihood that you are not the first human to conceive of this idea, you would actually be the idea thief. Which is kind of silly when you put it that way\u2026because whoever had the thought before you did nothing with it\u2026\n\nBetter then if we all agree that thoughts are not property that can be owned, hoarded or stolen from one another eh? It\u2019s yours when you execute it. \n\n\n\n2.) If the executional blueprint for the idea can be easily communicated and then carried out successfully without you, then it lacks a unique/innovative quality, which is the only thing that\u2019s going to make it competitive against existing businesses in it\u2019s niche. \nWhich would mean the idea is a copycat of an existing model (nothing wrong with that, but it ain\u2019t yours), or it lacks a compelling value proposition. \n\nFor example: Your idea is to build an online retailer that leverages immense volume to buy inventory at insanely low cost, allowing you to undercut every other retailer in price. Like an online version of Wal Mart. Better yet, you\u2019ll build the worlds most advanced network of warehousing and shipping facilities on every block, allowing you to deliver packages within a few hours. Brilliant idea.\n\n\u2026I just described Amazon. This obviously wasn\u2019t Bezos\u2019s original idea. It likely materialized gradually after he started to execute his initial idea of selling books online, which he probably though was brilliant before he actually started (hint hint). But even if he broadcasted the winning version of his idea to the whole country, it would have been very difficult to execute without him. \n\nAmazon is a copycat of Wal Mart\u2019s  model but with a few major improvements\u2026you don\u2019t have to leave the house to buy basically anything you want, you can shop a multitude of different vendors instead of one single shelf price, you can quite easily become a legitimate vendor yourself, and they control one of the most intricate and valuable supply chains ever conceived. \n\nI just explained Amazon\u2019s \u201cidea\u201d but is anyone about to go \u201csteal\u201d it? No. Why? Because the value of Amazon is in their execution of the idea. It would cost a bazillion dollars just to attempt to compete (and fail), and without an operational genius like Bezos most of us would probably sink that ship with a blank check to fund it. \n\n\n3.) An idea is not an asset because it can be explained over a quick meal or a phone call. And sure, anything that can be fully conveyed over a thirty minute convo can be stolen, and the burden of execution will be just as heavy on the guy who stole it.\n\n- A business is an asset because it consists of executing hundreds of small to large tasks, some of which are planned, most of which are completely unexpected, as they come up, 24/7 for months or even years before there is any consistent and sustainable flow of money-in and money-out. You\u2019ll need to figure out talent acquisition and retention, training, management; rev-ops: marketing, sales, deal restructuring, customer service, etc etc etc. All of which is impossible to accurately plan to any meaningful degree of completion while it\u2019s still a thought bubble in your mind. \n\n- Your idea comprises less than 1% of the actual business that would have to come of it before it would be an asset of any value worth stealing, and in the slim chance that a functioning business were to materialize after 2-10 years of immense struggle and adaptation, it would likely be unrecognizable from your original idea. \n\n- If I stole your idea, I would have myself &lt;1% of a business that I must now go and build the other 99.999% without you. And that is assuming that the idea itself doesn\u2019t have a hundred little unforeseen hiccups that would eat up my budget long before a sustainable profit model is established. Plus if I have the deep resources, psychotic work-ethic, and monk-like patience and discipline to execute ANY business idea to a point of success, why would I steal the simplest, easiest, and laziest part? \n\n- Anyone who has the prowess to execute a detailed business plan is not going to need to steal the most basic, un-tested, imagined iteration of a business. That is why investors don\u2019t invest in ideas. They want to see a comprehensive business plan from start to finish, with an already operational revenue model, and a trail of existing cashflow, among many other things to prove it. Investors like existing businesses that are already successful, but constrained by a lack of capital to meet overwhelming demand. Sure, there are some exceptions to this but they all involve an asset that is much farther along than an idea in someone\u2019s mind.",

Quite often when they come in theyre nervous and want to sign NDAs before they share their \"amazing\" idea.\n\nBut i'll tell you right now - we're not interested in stealing your idea. We chose our current business model for a reason - far more stability and a lot less risk. Think of the old quote - \"The only people to get rich in a gold rush are those selling the shovels\". That's us. \n\nWe've developed a few SaaS products in conjuction with others over the years. If their idea takes off and makes millions, then we benefit from more work from them. If it crashes and burns, we get paid regardless. Thats the business model for me.\n\nBut one thing I've learned from working with all these SaaS companies. It doesnt matter how good the idea is, or how well you build it (obviously we build it amazingly well :-) - selling things on the internet is HARD. People dont want to pay for things.\n\nThe systems that work are those run by people with connections. You have to be influential enough in your industry to persuade people to sign up to the system. Most people manage to get a few friends onbord, but nowhere near a critical mass for it to take off and become profitable. \n\nAnd thats why I have no interest in your idea. It might be the best idea i've ever heard. But I dont know your industry, and I dont have the connections to make it succeed. Instead I'd rather work with you and get paid to develop the system, then hopefully get further revenue in future maintaining it when it takes off.\n\nSo stop worrying about people pinching your idea. They just arent interested.",

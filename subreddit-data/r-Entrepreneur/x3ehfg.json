    "postText": "This is aimed at younger folks and those just getting started in entrepreneurship, particularly in tech.\n\nAll over TikTok and Reddit, people keep throwing around all this useless advice to \"become successful.\" Wake up earlier, read more books, etc. Courses about getting an \"entrepreneurs\" mindset. That you have to hustle and work hard. \n\nAll of that is bullshit. Those attributes will not make you successful. \n\nI mean don't get me wrong--it's good to organize your life. But speaking as someone who founded four successful online businesses and works in a VC firm, these trendy pieces of \"advice\" are all platitudes. \n\nThe best piece of actionable advice I can give, based on founding four successful businesses and working with other successful firms, is this: \n\n# 1). Pick and industry or niche, and master it. \n\nThis is a huge pre-requisite that's not emphasized enough. Identify the industry or niche you want to enter (as specifically as possible) and become a master in it. Learn everything you can. \n\nBuy products from your (future) competitors. Understand the pain points that consumers in this industry face. Do market research. Figure out which keyword combinations to target. Learn about the technical attributes.\n\nThe most successful businesses I've worked with all follow the same trend: They were formed by people who used to work in a specific industry as 9-5 employees, working for a company. They accumulated significant industry-specific knowledge, and understood pain points. Then they started their own business in this industry, targeting those pain points. \n\n# 2). Target an intersection of two industries or niches.\n\nWhat happens if you can't pick which industry or niche to enter? Or what if your selected industry is too competitive?\n\nDo this: list what you're good at, or what you're interested in. These can be as random as you'd like. Then, pinpoint a (viable) intersection between two listed interests or skills. \n\nFor example: let's say you can build websites relatively well. You're also interested in cars.\n\nAs we're all aware, the web design industry is \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* competitive. And what do cars have to do with web design? \n\nInstead of entering the web design field, enter the web design field targeting automotive dealers and mechanic shops. Build a few fake demo websites for auto mechanics, and then cold call auto mechanic shops with poor websites and offer them their services. Capture the vertical.\n\nTime and time again, I've seen this trend: \n\n* Person works for a corporation, in a specific industry. \n* Person accumulates knowledge about said industry. \n* Person leaves the company, and starts his own small business targeting a pain point that their former employer was unwilling to target.",

            "comment": "Therapist here. \n\nAs you might imagine the field of creative psychology has been exploding for years. Everyone wants the secret sauce to either be or hire the person to invent the next sprocket. There is a model called Bloom\u2019s taxonomy of learning (shaped like a pyramid) which shows basic knowledge gathering/retention as the lowest state and creativity as the highest. So everyone thinks you can just chop off the top and run with it - unfortunately this leaves you with a very small pyramid. Like you said, building out the foundation as well as the subsequent steps will give you a more substantial result. \n\nThe other variable is that the system - any societal system has never been fair. Geniuses whose insights have turned the corner on humanity die penniless and unknown while snake oil salesmen make money hand over fist. The diet industry is about 71 billion dollars and most of it is demonstrably false.  \n\nIdeally you have a great idea, connect it to the market, and it takes off. But great ideas fall through the cracks or are undervalued and well marketed junk can rise to the top. I think there is some value in acknowledging this phenomenon exists but also agree that many of these books are just selling the idea that you can game/outsmart or outwork the system which often requires resources that are beyond a regular person\u2019s means.",

At the end of the day, it\u2019s about creating something that has more value to the buyer than the money they are giving you. This is highly variable and there is no magic framework to do this because segments in industry vary significantly from one area to the other. Specialized information in a niche or vertical is the \u201ckey\u201d that unlocks that particular niche. \n\nBut yes, the system is the opposite of perfect. I\u2019ve seen very many phenomenal products with huge potential never take off. It gets worse in the corporate world. Everything there is dictated by quantitative risk analysis. \n\nSlightly off topic but it\u2019s something that really bothers me. For example\u2014pharmaceutical firms are mandated to invest a certain portion of income into R&amp;D in many countries. Yet, the vast majority of that goes into research on how to produce existing drugs cheaper for higher margins. Very little actually gets to novel drug discovery pipelines. Most of that is still handled by government. \n\nIt seems to me that for true innovation to occur, investment must be done in high-risk areas that really only government/public sector is willing to do. For example, academia. And only when proof of concept and feasibility is established will corporations be interested in adoption (mRNA vaccines are a good example).\n\nI\u2019m of the idea that corporations can iteratively innovate upon existing products very well (see smartphones) but they are seemingly unable to create a brand new innovation from scratch (i.e the internet which was created by US government funding).",

Ultimately most scientist/researchers are just curious people who are passionate about their tinkering. Sometimes they move with intention but more often they stumble across something significant that isn\u2019t notable until someone needs that particular information. In the early 19th century physics was regarded in a similar way as we see philosophy today. A field for wispy minded academics, with the useful parts of the field largely completed and the unknown parts being so obscure and useless that their exploration and especially their funding seems like an exercise in waste. Then the atomic bomb came and all the sudden physics is considered the hardest and most fundamental of all the sciences. \n\nThere is an absolutely massive amount of time energy and money that goes into basic research before it comes up with something marketable. I think it\u2019s worth it without any result at all but definitely when you consider that huge pivots for humanity like the development of the internet.",

If I'm really bad at making scarves and take twice as long as you, is mine worth twice as much as yours? No!\n\nAnd that is why niches are so important. An old boss once told me \"The riches are in the niches.\"\n\nI can go buy another scarf for $10-20. The less saturated your market, the more say you have in the cost.

They don't see all the B.S you've had to wade through to get there. \n\nIt's said pursuing entrepreneurship is one of the loneliest roads you can take because 80% of people doubt you the whole time. They question all the different \"jobs\" you've had when really you weren't pursuing a career, your pursuing skills. Increasing your value to the market place. \n\nNo one is born with the skills for anything. Talent is a complete lie. I'm a very good artist. People have always said \"I wish I could draw like that.\" \n\nThey think I was born with this skill and call it talent. I wasn't. I had to develop it. In fact, for those of you who hate on courses and further learning...\n\nI loved drawing. But what elevated my skills as an artist was when in first grade I had my first library visit. That's when I discovered there were books that teach you how to draw. I devoured them and took their lessons. Practiced. And pretty soon I had a \"system\" I could use to draw out each idea in my mind thanks to this book. All the way up to my senior year, I outpaced everyone else in art classes over the years. Because I kept reading. \n\nFast forward many years later and I'm 21 in my third year as a correctional officer in a maximum security prison. I HATED IT. 41 people hired in my academy, only 6 of us left from my academy after 3 yrs. 12-16 hour grueling shifts. \n\nI needed a change. I went into that field to become a patrol officer. Found I didn't want to carry a weapon for a living as it would put me in situations I may need to use it. \n\nPeople kept telling me to get into sales. But I had no experience. And no confidence as an introvert. But after a life changing event I decided I would do what I did with learning to draw and do the same thing with sales. \n\nRead a single book. \"How I raised myself from failure to success in sales\" by Frank Betger. Applied nervously at my first sales job, sleep train. 3 stage interview. To this day, hardest interview experience ever. Even more so than the prison, which was a joke. They take anyone. \n\nHad to do my first sales role-play in that interview. No experience I passed it with flying colors. On the fly. And it was thanks to reading that book. \n\nFound out later that it cost the company $10k for a single employee to go through their training program to sell temperpedics. It was adapted from Jordan belforts straight line system. So I ended up getting stellar sales training from my first sales job.\n\nBut my experience of reading a book, practicing and applying what I learn, and getting results has made me a reading addict. I read 2 books a month. I have grown and developed by leaps and bounds. \n\nTaking courses and reading has helped me learn and grow where I can't afford coaching. Some courses and books are a waste.\n\nGrowing and building a business requires a lot skills. You can't learn it unless your willing to go out and develop the experience and skills to make it successful.\n\nBeing willing to fail multiple times before you succeed is a prerequisite to success.",

I think this is one of the most important keys! \nI might trigger with the next sentence - Business is gambling BUT you can make calculated steps but at the end of the day it is not GURANTEED you\u2019ll make a profit out of it. \n\nWhat it teach us? \nDiscipline, smart+hard work, risk management, mental + physical toughness, daily routines, business language, networking, learning, investing, critical thinking, planning, executing, philosophy, realistic goals, environment around you, health and so many things subconsciously and consciously are involved or part of the process. \n\nIf you build a running E-Commerce project, where a customer visits, purchase your product and receives it by a delivery which is automated process in collaboration with Fulfilment centre it means you have already built successful business module. You know how to do basic market research, build online shop, marketing, logistics, building business relationships and so on\u2026 Each of the skill you have learned can be converted into money helping other business people or friends navigate their business. \n\nHow we measure success today? \nHow much is your Return on investment. No one is looking at how successful you\u2019re as an individual by knowing how to build a running online business. In order to build it you need part/all or even more of the abilities, skills.. I mentioned above. \n\nTraining muscle with the right dose of intensity = growth, the same with your brain. You need all of the components to be successful and only way to fail is by quitting!!\n\n+Some people first need to learn how to make their bed, why? Because that\u2019s part of the discipline and morning routines. \n\nThere will be always people with examples, like, OH, Wiz Khalifa is smoking weed and earning money but no one sees how much work goes in the backstage. He still has all the necessary components. \n\nOh, btw, we sometimes spend time and energy on things that won\u2019t bring any value. Spending 10 hours on your brand name which can be changed in the future will not make any difference. \n\nYou need to understand that money is in other people pockets. It means you need to sell and you need to learn how to sell and what to sell. Start with learning how to sell and what sell and then move piece by piece. If you don\u2019t have a client, no matter how good you\u2019re, you still need sales to run a business. You either hire sales team or do it yourself. \n\nA good example, you learn in school the basics in math, physics, sports etc. Teachers, especially in business schools has all the knowledge to open a business but some of their abilities are missing like or they simply do not want to do it but why? They teach you all about business and then when you get first rejection your inner ego is broken and you start thinking this is not for me or I\u2019m a failure because that was part of the school system teaching us you need the best grades to be successful but in business you need to keep moving forward and quitting is only failure. \n\n+",

In fact, the definition has changed or shifted multiple times since it was first written down by the French. Do we define an entrepreneur by their success at building a business or are they defined by the process of taking a risk and the struggle to build a business, even one that fails? How do we even define what it means to be a \u201csuccessful entrepreneur\u201d? Until the early 1990s  research on entrepreneurship was decidedly male focused to the point that if woman business owners responded to surveys sent out to businesses, they were excluded from the research being done. Does that mean that only men can be entrepreneurs? \n\nI don\u2019t see \u201centrepreneurship\u201d being defined any time soon. If anything the term has been so muddied in the last 10 years perhaps we need a new term completely.

Being an entrepreneur is all about your your means of physical production, how you innovate your process. It has nothing to do with who or how you hire. All you need to be an entrepreneur is the ability to execute on an old idea in a novel and innovative new way. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t need to be making money from it or have a full time employee. A great example of entrepreneurs are the McDonald brothers who started McDonalds. All they did, aside from deciding to use fresh ingredients. was formulate a new way of cooking their food in a more efficient, cost effective way. Same thing with Henry Ford. He literally came up with a new way to manufacture cars by inventing the assembly line. He didn\u2019t invent the car, not even the engine. All he did was formulate a new way to physically produce cars, that happened to transform American manufacturing forever. That made him an entrepreneur. The same could be said of Musk who formulated a new method for manufacturing Teslas. Same idea. Some entrepreneurs do invent entirely new products, but it\u2019s the new means of production that afford them the moniker. I realize you\u2019re likely to ignore this info as bullshit but whatever. This is what being an entrepreneur actually means.",

Someone that's just freelancing at $200k/year in an LLC is not achieving economic growth. \n\nThe McDonalds story is far more nuances than that, and they absolutely achieved and created - through their innovations - enormous economic growth. For their families, for investors, ultimately for Ray Kroc and generations of people beyond that. \n\nAn entrepreneur's success is not measured in good vibes and platitudes. It's measured in economic output.",

I'll give it a shot.\n\nDo I think it's damaging, overall? Yes, I absolutely do. I don't think it's good for humanity, and I think many Americans (not exclusive to America, but in my experience it's heavily the case here) suffer from this. \n\nThis is because the whole machinery of constant economic participation - more, more, more - is draining emotionally and physically. This doesn't make me a hypocrite for my statements, but this is why I say entrepreneurship isn't for everyone. \n\nI can see the human perspective, the \"antiwork\" movement and other post-capitalist perspectives and understand it. I get why, but the American economy simply wasn't setup that way and likely never will be. \n\nI've had businesses in 6 countries, extensively in Europe and in Asia. What I found interesting in Europe is they absolutely did NOT have this mindset. I'm generalizing a bit, but the constant feeling of threat, competition, etc. simply wasn't there. \n\nThat said, once it's in your system there's no going back. It's what I do, and I can't/won't do anything else. \n\nTo summarize: I think we lie to ourselves if we don't think entrepreneurship is measured by output. That's the whole point. You put in risk and, if you are lucky, you get a reward; in some cases, the reward is huge. In others, you lose and lose big. \n\nI appreciate the question. Happy to engage further on the topic as I find it interesting.",

It's not creating anything, it's not innovating anything and it's not scaling anything. It's a service, and it provides the owner freedom, and that's fantastic. \n\nI think too many see entrepreneurship as \"I don't like my job!\" and the pursuit of alternatives rather than the pursuit of a new marketable solution. \n\nMy point is that these infoprereneurs market to people that emotionally subscribe to these ideas. Just like the \"Everyone can get rich in real estate!\" people, they sell you courses and other nonsense that's just recycled from legitimate authors. \n\nEntrepreneurship is about taking on risk for greater reward. It's about results, scale, creating and growing jobs, etc. and not purely a lifestyle choice. \n\nPersonally speaking, my professional circle is mostly entrepreneurs. Absolutely no one talks about \"Hustle\", \"24x7!\" and other identity promotions. They're just kicking ass and working hard.",

Smale found that the best form of marketing is word of mouth - and by truly helping people your success will compound dramatically over the years. \n\n3. STAY ON TOP OF YOUR NUMBERS \n\n4 Aim to improve just by 10%. As your business grows a 10% improvement would be considerable. \n\n5.

Has the kind of people you want to work with. If you want to stay away from criminals, do not become a criminal lawyer.\n1. Requires doing the kind of things that you are comfortable doing. If you cannot see blood without fainting, do not become a surgeon.\n1. Has people willing to pay someone for what you are planning to do. Do not try to make a career out of your donut-eating skills.\n1. If people are willing to pay someone for what you want to do, make sure to be that someone, i.e. at least look competitive.\n\nThe previous points are just to get a job. If you want to try entrepreneurship then:\n\n1. Find a niche or industry where people and companies are willing to outsource the job, rather than keeping their own teams in-house for it. Consider this in the context of the people you want to work with too.\n1. Find a way to show that you are the best option for them. You want them to find you, and you want them to prefer you over any other potential competitors they may find too. There are 4 main ways to do this, depending on the 4 stages a market may be: functionality or features, reliability, convenience, and cost. Unaddressed pain points may be found in any of the 4 stages, being more likely in the early stages, and only cost in the last stage.\n\nYou may find that the previous points need further clarification and detail. If you want enough level of detail, you may need to read a book for each point. After you have done that, you may have additional questions, leading to additional books. Take it easy.\n\n&gt; I am very frustrated about all the generic advice and bullshit courses out there.\n\nYes, I am too.",

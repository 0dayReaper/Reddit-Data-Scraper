    "postText": "I did commerce at university which didnt help me much as I ended up in IT. But I do know how to run a business, always helping others with their business and market research etc.\n\nHow do you just magically think of a business oppurtunity? This has always been my stone wall to acton, as Im sure it is others.\n\nI dont expect to be spoon fed here, but just some ideas on how to identify a business opportunity in the information age when everything feels saturated.\n\nI dont mean a business that becomes a secondary job, I mean ideas that can produce serious wealth providing the market is there and is not saturated?\n\nand how do you run the business from abroad, my local market is only a few million people, so there is no economy of scale there, I would need to tap into the US and other large markets.\n\nIm sure this is a stumbling block for many. But any genuine, constructive tips for breaking this barrier would mean so much to me. Thanks :-)",

I considered setting up business for myself in Software, which I Project Manage, Ive done the executive path but really enjoy project management.\n\nSo I thought, what about Mobile apps, because I see the millions of terrible apps and wonder to myself, do people really buy mobile apps? Clearly they do, so my thought was instead of racking my brain, pick an app in a field I understand, study the market and pick the best apps, study them, then using my business plan skills to write a better plan including the usuals like marketing analysis, cost benefit analysis etc, then use my output to decide if there is a profit in it or not, if so, build similar app built on better use cases, for me UX is often lost and seems to be the biggest reason so many apps are terrible. \n\nPerhaps I could combine my love of SDLC with the love of one of my hobbies, something I know very well, which should give me the ability to judge use cases and UX in general, better than a product or activity I do not understand, \n\nI look at the amount of successful apps that are cheap knock offs of a corporate product. ie look how many apps at their core are just cheaper versions of the free \"Skype\". Everytime somebody asks me if I use xyz, I think to myself, \"there are already better apps available, not another clone\".\n\nIm very humble at this stage because I am lost in the swag of entrepreneurs but also Im yet to build, market and sell anything. Im fighting the \"if I can do it must have already been done\" feeling.",

Use reverse of negative comments in your marketing copy. \n\nExamples:\n\nOnline courses - a major complaint is not enough real world examples/use cases or advanced content\n\nPhysical products - common complaints are low quality or missing features\n\nIf you want B2B - common challenges are buy in and adoption. Find a common business problem then focus on solving those challenges",

The amount of clones of messaging apps is mind blowing, including how terrible the UI is let alone the UX.\n\nBut even outside software this occurs. Business should always be customer focussed, but it should also be done properly with proper Business Plans etc. So many people set up business without even having done a market analysis to know whether there is a market or their product.",

This creates serious anxiety, and stops me dead in my tracks.\n\nI think it stems from being poor and in dysfunctional house, yet I went to a school of rich kids. Which put me off education and instead I went to school to play Rugby. I did pass, but I never felt like I deserved to be there. Im working on this emotional issue, but that is my main stumbling block. Not wanting to sound \"poor me\", I know a lot of people have it far worse in life. Im thankful where I am. But Im now middle aged, most of my school friends are very successful and wealthy, even the ones who had to repeat year 10. I would love to make people proud of me and do something successful that brings me financial security.\n\nIm trying to resolve this, Im trying to remain up tempo and positive. I want to achieve something before Im too old and I just want a modest retirement fund and to be financially secure. I have no desire to be a billionaire, but I still need to work hard to achieve financial security.",

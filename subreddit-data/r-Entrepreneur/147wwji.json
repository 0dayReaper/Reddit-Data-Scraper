    "postText": "I\u2019m 23F and I currently work in the financial industry. It\u2019s always been my ambition to come up with my own business idea and start a company. Now, I feel like I have a really good idea to start my own business. I am just stumped on what my next best steps should be. For those who have started successful businesses, any tips? \n\nI\u2019ve always believed that every great business starts with just an idea, but what\u2019s next? Patent? Making a prototype? Finding investors? Creating a brand? All of the above? any help is appreciated :)\n\nAlso, if anyone has any helpful book recommendations on this topic, that would be great too. \n\nthank you",

It\u2019s a way that many people end up investing money into businesses that never succeed. Since you said shoes and clothing, if you had a pair of titanium work, boots would fit into the category of shoes or boots, but it would not be likely to sell because they would be stiff, heavy and expensive. I bet you might come up with a pair of leather boots that had electromagnets in it to help roofers stay attached to metal roofs and you would want to make a pair of those boots and test them with roofers and then once you\u2019ve proved concept from the actual boot, you would take it and create your first run of boots and try to sell them and you need to know your ideal customer and why they would be buying the boot and you would need to do testing to find the appropriate profit zone for the boot to be sold and a lot of it will just be testing and re-testing especially as things like culture and brand start to develop",

It's also another thing to get someone to say they would buy something, versus them actually buying it.  \n\nI'd recommend OP tries to sell their product/service before it even exists rather than spend resources building something that may not have a viable market.

Way back in the early days of the Internet (the 1990s), a guy wondered if it would be possible to sell chocolate on the Internet. (Yes, people did not yet know this.)  \n\nSo he started a website and allowed himself to lose $10,000 to find out how viable the business would be. When he actually got an order, he would repackage a box of nice chocolates he had bought in bulk from a vendor and send it out. They were good quality chocolates and he wanted to have a good reputation. \n\nThe website got enough orders that he felt like it was worth actually investing. For a while business boomed. Then competitors moved in. Chocolate wasn\u2019t profitable anymore.   \n\n\n30 years later, I think the remnants of the website still exist as an online greeting card company [Blue Mountain](https://www.bluemountain.com/member-benefits)",

Products aren't the same either.\n\nAn idea is great, but what you need to do before you invest any money (and certainly ask for someone else's money) is make sure that people will pay for your idea. Businesses that solve problems that are worth paying to have solved are businesses that succeed.\n\nYou can avoid this by talking to people. Identify who your target customer is, and talk to as many of them as you can. Read *The Mom Test* to get a better sense of how to talk to people and read between the lines on their feedback. When you talk to people, they will probably be nice and say your idea is good. ignore them. Instead, ask them if they are willing to pay for your product, and if enough of them say \"yes\" then you are on to something.\n\nThen it's time to launch your product (whatever it is), and get to marketing and sales. It's tempting to outsource these, but don't. You need to make sales if your business is going to work and you can't hire a sales rep if you haven't made any sales yourself.\n\nLastly, pace yourself. It will take time, but that's okay. Learn to pivot and adapt based on feedback you receive and you may succeed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit. Double-typed a couple sentences, so removed for clarity.",

Ideas are OK, but making something new and revolutionary is hard to execute, especially if you don't know the crowd or the potential users.\nIt's recommended to first ask as many people as possible some questions about their needs around your idea without giving too much of it and see if your idea fits their reality. This alone can give you more details or kill it completely.\nThen if it all goes to plan, try a very dumbed down version and see people's reaction to it. You'll prototype A LOT before you get it right.\nIt's also important to be tenacious. Being vulnerable and giving up easily is what prevents many people from opening successful businesses.\n\nThere are tons of other steps, but this would be a pretty stable starting point",

Don\u2019t fall in love with your own idea. \n\nYou might think you have the best business idea ever, but the rest of the world might not.\n\nAn idea needs demand validation. A simple way to do this is to show competitors in the space. If there is healthy competition, it means it\u2019s a space that has demand.\n\nIf no one else is doing your idea, it\u2019s either the first time someone has ever thought of it, meaning if it\u2019s actually useful AND you\u2019re first, you will clean up.\n\nHowever, 9 times out of 10 if no one else is doing the idea it\u2019s just because it\u2019s a product no one actually wants.",

A reality that solves problems and helps each of its stakeholders -- you the founder, your team, buyers, investors ....\n\nBut, it's a long journey. A journey fuelled by your passion and facilitated by a network of facilitators, providers, creators , investors.... \n\nThe above is somewhat a romantic description of your journey ahead. This description is necessary because entrepreneurship is a lifestyle. If you are not passionate about your lifestyle, you'll fail.\n\nNow, the actual &amp; practical steps of the journey\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Plan: Write down what you want to do. You may call it a \"business plan\" or give any fancy name you like. You can use old pen &amp; paper or highly sophisticated Business Plan tools / SAAS. Many of them now AI powered, making things easy for you. \n2. MVP: Develop a minimum viable product ( MVP) that functions as you intend it to \n3. Private Test: Invite a couple of friends and prospects to test your MVP . It's called Private Beta launch. You call it what you want. No one's stopping you from being creative and coin a new word for it. ( Remember, they may not be as excited about your idea/MVP as you. Don't let them dampen your passion. But don't be blind to positive feedback)\n4.  Public Test: Did the friends &amp; foes okayed your MVP ? Go ahead, jump into a bit deeper water. Announce online and let everyone try your \"masterpiece \" . Yeah let them  \"try\" ; not buy.  No one is going to. \n5. Fund: Things went well so far? Now you need a breed of human race called \"investors\" . They are also very passionate people -- but their passion is \"money\" . Make them passionate about your product by convincing them that your product is actually a magic Dollar Printer . For each one dollar put into this machine, it spews out 50 ( Be realistic. they may look fools  -- but they are not. )\n6. Expand/Thrive/Fail/Restart: wait for at least 1 year. How are the things? Already interviewed by Fortune under 30 team? Congrats!  Failed? Double Congrats! You are now a serial entrepreneur. Where's your 2nd idea? Quick -- go back to step 1\n\nWant to make it bigger as an entrepreneur. Reject my above advice as \"outdated\". Come up with your own steps. Launch your product. Succeed. \n\nNow take up the easier job -- start advising others as I'm doing now. Keep no more than 1% stake. ( But, I keep 3%)\n\nNB: My last sentence is actually a bait. I;m a startup mentor. I do startup mentoring and that's how I pay my bills and buy my bread &amp; butter.",

They can be a great option to sherpa you through the whole process.\n\nYou should also put together a formal advisory board. Do NOT give anyone money or equity for being on your advisory board. You're only asking for an occasional hour of people's time and for them to pick up the phone when you have a question. Find people who are looking to pay it forward and are genuinely interested in helping you and your business get off to a good start. Pick people who have experience as entrepreneurs and have expertise and/or connections in areas where you do not. Some of these early advisors may turn into investors or important partners down the road. Structure your advisory board like a formal governance board (but without real power). Hold meetings on a regular schedule, probably once a month in the beginning and later once per quarter. Keep minutes and have an agenda, etc.\n\nMy other recommendation may sound old fashioned, but you should write a comprehensive business plan. Any plan will be obsolete as soon as it's written, especially with a new business that is likely to evolve considerably in the early stages. But writing a detailed plan will force you to think through and research all the aspects of your business. Plans are useless but planning is everything, as the old saying goes.",

            "comment": "Grab a notebook and write down the business model.  Lay out the core groundwork of the business, its functions, deliverables, market segment, customers, logistics, etc.  You want to develop enough there to understand how it needs to function to generate what you want.  And then you need a sanity check against it.  You need to determine if it's even a good model.  Is it flawed?  Is it incomplete?  How resource intensive is it?  What kind of capital is required to get it started?  What kind of business partnerships are required to actually have a working process from A to Z?\n\nSome things to think about is how YOU can start this business.  When I talk about resources and capital, it means your time and your money.  If your business model requires 2000 hours of work to just build the core content and needs $5,000,000 of infrastructure to have a working system, well, how in the heck do you do that?  So, what can you change in the model to design out all that labor and all that infrastructure?  How can you scale it down to just you?  Or how can it be fundamentally different in design to only need maybe 10 hours a week of your time and $1000 of start up funding?\n\nPart of this business model exercise is the idea of how you fit into this system.  It's also the idea of how to start first, then grow.  And it helps you model out what kind of partnership and skill sets you need in your company to actually make it function.  Realize there are a lot of companies who's business model is having those human resources and capital equipment to do work.  You don't necessarily need to have any yourself.  This is not just manufacturers to help you build your product but also office operations like phone and e-mail, tech support, and so on.  Plus there are logistics partners who can handle packaging and shipping.  There's costs to all of this however, and some of this style of operation creates inefficiencies and lack of control.  But, these are ways to let you start with very little investment and have a wealth of people, equipment, knowledge, and established processes in place that you're effectively renting.\n\nBut with all that said, two things come to mind.\n\nOne, your business model is everything.  You need to develop a model that is good, functional, and is capable of achieving what you want from this business.  The model controls fundamentally how it works, and you need to spend a serious amount of time developing it well.  Do NOT stick with bad models.  The development of the business model should be a very fluid one, one that perpetually changes, evolves, wipes clean, and gets remade.  You're working through a lot of unknowns, researching and gaining knowledge, and building up a concept that can actually be successful, and not just successful as a gut feeling but through data and analytics.  The design is sound, highly functional, highly competitive, and low risk.\n\nTwo, money should be the last part of all of this.  I know in this sub every post is \"I have $X, how do I spend it to make a business.\"  Money is the last step, the very last thing.  There is no guess work to cash because you've spent all the time developing the model, the products, researched the market, got quotes for everything, figured out all your pricing structures, compared against competition, everything.  You've done all this work that you know exactly how the business works and costs.  You know exactly what you need to start, how much time is required to start and ramp up.  At the very end, you know exactly that you'll need $8,000 and 400 hours of time at the point of go to step through a small series of actions to turn the business on and get it running.  Then you just put in the hours to develop what you need and set up the business, save up cash or source loans or investors, whatever, and start paying out to get the gears turning.",

This can be done by searching your state\u2019s secretary and filing online, fee should be well under $100.\n\nAfter this is completed, file for an EIN for your business. This is the businesses social security number if you will. Start a business bank account with it and begin feeding the account with any spare or saved funds. The business account will make your taxes easier and separate yours personal finances. Also, keep all receipts of the previous transactions (LLC/EIN) for the first years filing. \n\nFrom here, consult with the mentor you choose for helpful steps along the way. \n\nAlso, here is a website that offers free college classes (varies on length of classes, but some are just a few hours) on the subject you desire. I took some marketing and finance classes through here and it really answered a lot of questions.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to enjoy the process and pat yourself on the back for the small steps and the hours you\u2019ll dedicate to it. \n\nAs most will say, it\u2019s not for everyone, most can\u2019t balance a first business and any type of personal life unless you are using that time to promote your business. It will suck your soul out of your ass if you\u2019re not careful, but also, you will have yourself to thank once you find success. \n\nGood luck!",

But there are many, many different ways to validate. A pretty straightforward and cost effective validation method is called a \"painted door experiment.\"\n\nA prescriptive example: \n\nAssume you've thought of a potential problem and you're idea is a widget that makes plumbers more efficient on a job site (discovery phase). To validate the idea you would create a landing page highlighting the value proposition of the product, etc. and include a signup form. Make sure you have analytics setup. Then you just need to decide how to drive traffic to the landing page. Could be a small Facebook ad budget, or some posts in r/plumbers, or whatever. Lots of options. \n\nYou'll need to determine the required sample size to get trustworthy results, but you'll measure click-thru rate (CTR) and signups (conversion).  If you reach statistically significant CTR and Conversion, you've validated the demand for the product (not to be taken as gospel, tho) and with the signups you now have a group of users to use for beta testing. Which is where you'll figure out brand/messaging, pricing, sales funnel, etc. \n\nNote: the order of operations can vary from product to product or business to business. For example, if consumers are very price sensitive (which you should know from your problem discovery phase), then you'll want to figure out what your unit economics will be earlier on so that you dont anchor customers on a price that's below your breakeven point.",

Perfect opportunity to purchase a business thats already cash flowing and sometimes with creative financing, owner financing you can purchase them with little to no money down and pay monthly payments from the profits of the business.  A-lot easier to start a new product than a new business and much more evidence of success than start ups, half of all startups are failures in thr first 12 months and 90% in the first 5 years. Pretty bad odds compared to purchasing a cash flowing business and using that cash flow to introduce your new product idea. Good luck",

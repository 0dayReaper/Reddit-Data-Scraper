    "postText": "Trying to flesh out a business idea that me and my friend had, wanted to post it here to see what you guys think. \n\nI was thinking of a Jeep/Camping rental service package where we get a jeep/jeeps and kit it out with camping equipment; throw a storage container up top and put in a tent, pop up bbq, could have an option for a kayak, etc. 2 night minimum booking. GPS. Strong social media presence and online booking. Can leave jeep in a seasonal parking garage for the summer and put a lockbox on the jeep and give customers a code when they book then clean it in between clients. In the winter time, could put a plow on it and plow people's driveways.\n\nI was thinking about financing a used jeep (with no mods or small tasteful mods) and using that. Currently I get 3 weeks off at a time from work so I would have the time to fix/repair most things on my own. I've done some rough math and with even 4 bookings a month it can be profitable but where I'm at there are only really 4 months a year for viable camping. I live in a place where there is tons of tourism in the summer and lots of spots to camp.\n\nI didn't include all of the little details in this but as a whole, how does this sound? TIA :)",

            "comment": "Between the costs of Jeeps right now, and the cost of decent camping gear, and the amount of screwing up people can do with vehicles and gear that aren't theirs, especially off road, plus the need for vehicle and renter retrieval when things break down somewhere remote, you're going to have to charge a fair bit to make a decent profit on it.\n\nI mean, figure the time and materials cost of cleaning and inspecting (and potentially repairing) a car that's just spent the weekend off-roading. That will add up, even if you're doing it yourself.\n\nAlso, seasonal parking garages tend to be pretty costly depending on your area.\n\nI mean, I would love a service like this, as I have some rural property and don't own a Jeep, but there's a reason most rental agencies and Turo prohibit the use of the vehicles off of paved roads.\n\nIf you can make the math work, there's definitely a demand for it if the prices aren't outrageous.",

                    "comment": "It's not really supposed to be for hardcore offroading per se but moreso taking advantage of the jeep for easy customization, simple repairs/maintenance and lots of storage. Like yeah people will probably be driving down dirt roads and on grass but it's not supposed to be for \"off roading\", which won't necessarily stop people from doing this. Hopefully a damage deposit is enough to deter people from doing anything too stupid.\n\nI'm guessing about two hours of cleaning in between each booking. You can get a decent used jeep for 20-30k which financed over 72 months is no more than 420 a month. Parkade downtown where I'm at is 115 a month and an insurance quote I did for this was 85 a month. \n\nThe equipment is definitely going to be the biggest upfront cost.\n\nI appreciate the feedback, if you disagree with what I've said or think of anything else please reply!",

I'm not sure that's the car rental space right now.",

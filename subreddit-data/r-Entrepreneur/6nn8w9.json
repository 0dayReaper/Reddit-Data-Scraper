    "postText": "I really think this should be a sticky.\n\nI've just had my entire PayPal balance held as a \"minimum reserve\", i.e., indefinitely, as well having a 15% 90-day rolling reserve added to anything new coming in.\n\nThis, after NINE uneventful years of using PayPal, under the assumption that their higher-than-normal fees are in compensation for the greater risk they bear with respect to fraud, international transactions, etc.  This is not just an issue for startups and high-risk business!\n\nWe've had zero cases of fraud in 9 years, and one accidental chargeback some 5 years ago.\n\nFor those who don't know what a reserve is, basically, PayPal takes your money and doesn't release it until 180 days after you close your account.  No interest, no warning, no explanation, good luck paying subcontractors in that time.\n\nI've already removed them from my cart and invoicing system (switching to Stripe for now), but since this potential business risk isn't written in big bold letters on their website, then I really think it should be up here.\n\nIt's hard to take the fee comparison charts seriously when this operating risk isn't included in the list of \"features\":\n\n- We offer a somewhat competitive 3.9% on transactions, and\n- Maybe all of your money, if we feel like it, without warning, on a day of our choosing.  Yay.\n\nEdit:\nThis is apparently a post people identify with.   I'm totally serious about making something like this sticky.  In terms of the potential operating risks faced by online startups, I really can't think of anything more universally applicable.  It's an existential threat for those who are just starting, and don't have the benefit of having monitored the forum for several months.\n\nEdit 2: To forestall some further PayPal hatred, I want to make it clear that I marvel at the world that they've created.  They've enabled relationships between vendors across the globe that would otherwise have been impossible.  However, if you were to poll a random sampling of their merchants, I very much doubt that even 1% could identify sudden, unannounced, seizures of previously-released funds as within the realm of PayPal's general operating procedure.  Most of us think that PayPal implements risk mitigation on a per-transaction basis.  So, that's why the PSA, so that it doesn't come as a surprise.  I will continue to use PayPal for paying vendors, but I know some clients who I have to call at exactly 9 am to let them know of the risk and advise them to either pull out their funds or deposit an additional cushion -- once PayPal tells me what that cushion has to be.

But surcharging itself is legal and fine by the card company agreements, as are cash discounts. In fact, cash discounts were suggested *by* the card companies before surcharging was allowed. They suggested it as an alternative, and still do.\n\nHere is [Visa's documentation](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/surcharging-faq-by-merchants.pdf) on it and here's [Mastercard's.](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/merchants/get-support/merchant-surcharge-rules.html)",

This means that customers can choose \"sign-in with my bank\", much like they can choose to sign in with Facebook with OAuth.\n\nThe upside of this is that it's easier and that you can control what centrally stored personal information is shared. The downside is that it makes it feasible to require identity checks and enforcement of age limits online, in situations where you may not have identified yourself at all before.",

I think we've been with PayPal so long that we never even paid attention to what others were experiencing since we joined.\n\nThankfully the entire amount was not a death blow, but it doesn't come without some need to adjust.  I can't imagine this happening to an early stage company with limited cash flow.\n\nWe're in the healthcare software business, international, $500 average transaction value.  Like I said, not even a single dispute, ever.  So as far as support could tell me it was probably on account of some larger than normal sales.\n\nI do advise some much larger customers, for whom a hold of this proportional size would require a significant cash injection.  I think I'll be advising them to switch.",

I probably have about 10-15 Paypal accounts, with all but 2 or 3 of them suspended/terminated for stupid reasons. My former businesses depended on PayPal, and Whenever I would recieve any money, I knew to transfer it out immediately based on my previous experiences. Didn't really help, I offered online services (Web/Game Hosting, VPS's, Dedicated Servers) and charged by the month. I had countless times where after 1 month, the customer decided they don't want the service any more and would do a paypal chargeback. Paypal would freeze the money and investigate and I would post proof and ToS and all logs I have and they would rule in my favor. The customer would then do a CC chargeback and there's nothing paypal can do at that point and the money went out of my account, putting me in the negative, etc. This happened all the time and I now never ever use paypal, even to buy things after I tried to buy sometime on Ebay that was mis represented and paypal wouldn't refund any money. I just called Amex, told them what happened they just did a chargeback on my behalf.",

It didn't help that I was a power seller moving 5k+/mo through my PayPal account. They didn't give a fuck, took my money and basically told me to go fuck myself. Since then, whenever I have a choice, I choose not to use PayPal. Friend needs to pay me back for something? Send it via Google wallet, venmo or whatever, but I'm not taking PayPal. ",

Rather like big clients not bothering to pay small suppliers on time, the problem seems to be endemic within the industry, and I suspect nothing short of legislation or statutory regulation will fix it at this point. :-(",

They kicked me off for selling Disney and Marvel merchandise without written authorization. Thing is, you don't need written authorization to sell their products as long as they're officially licensed. Not only do you not need it, but neither company even offers such an authorization, and that's what was relayed to me directly from both companies. I've in business 10 years and have accounts in good standing with all of my distributors and they don't care.\n\nJust a heads up.",

Get your spouse to keep an account separate in his or her maiden name. Always put things like cars etc into different not joint names.

It's actually extremely common for businesses to have issues like yours with PayPal and Square, and I'll explain why...\n\nPayPal is not a credit card processing company. Like Square, they are an aggregator. It's as if I open a merchant account and I let you, along with any other business, process through it. The account is mine, I'm just letting you use it. One reason businesses gravitate towards companies like Square and PayPal is because of how easy it is to sign up and get going. Anyone and everyone can do it. There are very few  questions asked. This is because both Square and PayPal have an \"ask questions later\" policy. Most providers will determine risk during the sign up process, and present you with your options (like if the account will require a reserve) which you would need  to sign off on before getting started, but not Square or PayPal. They'll let you sign up and start processing but the minute you go through a charge back,  heavy returns or there's a spike in your volume that they deem suspicious they'll freeze your accounts and begin asking the questions then. Or, like in your case, they'll implement a rolling reserve. \n\nYour best bet is to get an actual merchant account. Stripe is not a good option either, since they are also an aggregator. They operate the same way as Square and PayPal. There's a pretty good chance you'll find yourself in the same situation with them as PayPal. \n\nIf you would like some assistance, or if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. ",

                    "comment": "TBH, I don't actually have beef with the concept of reserves.  I have a very big issue with them coming unannounced.  If PayPal had only added a rolling reserve and said \"Hey, we're worried about risk, and so if you continue to use our services, then we'll withhold 15% for 90 days\", then I'd be completely cool with it.\n\nThis was not the case.  They just seized the whole balance.\n\nThe rep on the phone couldn't answer the question, he only gave a list of possible reasons for reserves, as a general rule, and surmised that maybe a recent larger transaction was the trigger.\n\nI'm not sure what a high-risk category is when it comes to digital goods.  We sell software and services.  Had a single dispute some years ago, and that was a case of misidentification of a transaction on the part of the client.",

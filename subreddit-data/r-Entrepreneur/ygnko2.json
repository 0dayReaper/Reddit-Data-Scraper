    "postText": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5. Have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses.\n\nEdit: Some redditors don\u2019t believe this, so search for\n\u201cForbes Centroamerica Abril 2022\u201d 30 promesas de los negocios, you will see my face on the cover.\n\nNew edit:\nI will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe, this isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for you!!! Human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths, imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing that human made fire wasn\u2019t sorcery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!!!",

And while it\u2019s not in the same industry, there is overlap so I know quite a bit about this. Outside of whatever the licensing agreement says, when it comes to franchising, corps can\u2019t tell franchises how to run their franchise rather they can set a level of expected outcome. In some instances, they can force franchisees to use specific vendors and it is beneficial to franchisees because usually, it is better pricing because of group pricing. BUT, this type of forced vendor usage gets really tricky outside of North America and Europe where vendors may not be able to provide their product/service at competitive rates because of distance and/or enough clients to make it profitable. As long as this kid was able to build a facility that met all the health requirements of the local government, he\u2019d be a viable vendor for any local franchise of a major multinational. However, does that mean this story is true? Couldn\u2019t tell ya, but it does seem highly unlikely.",

I have 100%verified that OP is who he says he is. I did this by finding the linkdn page that goes with the name for the centroamerican Forbes cover photo he referenced and literally just slid him a dm and asked \"is this you on Reddit\"?\n\nI got an answer and that answer is yes. \n\nEven without that final confirmation I was about 95% sure he was the guy when I went to bed last night. \n\nFor one all the companies he mentions in his post exist, are on his linkdn and have working websites. His picture is on the websites for the awards he said he won. The selfie he posted matched his linkdn and award photos and did not come up on a reverse Google images or any of the pages I looked at. \n\nThe points he was attacked the most on in the comments can largely be explained by cultural differences between Central America/Guatemala and the USA/Canadian//brit/Aussie skew that is the larger part of the English speaking reddit user base.\n\nStuff that is wild and unthinkable to us in the first world business wise is in fact normal and boring and routine in Central America. \n\nOP wasn't necessarily equipped to answer all those questions because he's probably no more familiar with our cultural expectations than we are his and he was very much outnumbered by the reddit sceptics, 25, and new to reddit and therefore not fully used to how discussions like this work. \n\nI made a few detailed comments in the below defending in greater detail how his story checks out. Feel free to find those for the heads up.\n\nBut serious hivemind, this is the real guy. I 100% verified that to my satisfaction. Please be chill and remember that the US, Canada, UK and Australia English speaking corner of Reddit are not the whole world.",

Why does one franchisee need 5000 teapots?\n\nI did a google. This part actually checks out. There is one mega-sized corp that runs a fuck ton of McDonalds in central america. They have about 4500 restaurants to their name, and about 75% of their locations are corporate owned, the rest are individual franchisees. So in business terms, they are a \"Middleman franchisee\" that basically sublets from the global McDonalds org.\n\nI most certainly accept that \"one franchisee\" that has several thousand locations that might actually be needing 5000 teapots (and then some)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcos\\_Dorados\\_Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcos_Dorados_Holdings)",

He put up some posts on his timeline that 100% proves it, and he messaged me from his Linkdn page saying \"This is me, lols!\". So yeah. He's the guy. If you still doubt, check out the handy post he made [here.](https://np.reddit.com/user/starterman001/comments/yh5nbu/proof/)\n\nend edit.\n\nRandom kid is an interesting phrase. Doing a lot of work there. I have Alberto Soto's linkdn up so I know for a fact that tea company exists and was founded in 2018. He's 25 now so getting a contract like that while 18/19 while impressive isn't absurd.\n\nHe did in fact wind up on the central American Forbes for his work with tunart the artisanal fishing corp he mentions,so \"Exceptional\" and \"Prodigy\" would probably describe him.\n\nHe did say that the point of the very favorable teapot contract was to get him backdoor funding for a tea production facility.\n\nHe pointed out that tea was an undersaturated market compared to coffee locally and while I haven't verified that it tracks. When was the last time you saw a commercial or ad for Colombian tea? Probably never. When was the last time you saw an ad for Columbian coffee? Probably goddam yesterday.\n\n(And yes I know Alberto Soto is Guatemalan and not Columbian. And that the two are different. The point stands.)\n\nSo that part tracks.\n\nIn terms of how business flows in central America I can it imagine this happening. I was a missionary in Venezuela for a year and as part of that I was expected to occasionally get people 'living in sin' hitched so that we could baptize them. Getting that wedding typically involved 'gifts' to civil servants to move from the back to the front of the line. Not really a secret down there just an ordinary and boring part of everyday life.\n\nWith that bit of personal history in mind this backdoor financing trick seems positively banal. A risk on the part of the supply officer to be sure, but a calculated one designed to get greater access to a relatively rare commodity by local standards.\n\nWhat's really convincing me that OP is who he says he is is the following.\n\n1. All these companies exist and the timeline tracks.\n2. His account in general has all the earmarks of a 25 year old who just discovered reddit such as making and then deleting dumb comments.\n3. The pic he posted sure does look like the guy on the linkdn page. It's a selfie. Reverse Google pulled nothing. It's not on any of the business pages or Alberto Soto's linkdn. 4.Truth is stranger than fiction. A clever liar wouldn't stand behind the teapot story, much less suggested it. Not an clever liar from the first world anyways. So OP is almost certain to be actually from Central America at the very least.\n\nNone of this is conclusive but internally I'm putting this in the 90-95% category ATM. Every thread I pull adds credibility as opposed to removes. At this point if it's not the real guy my only other explanations are a look alike or someone who is damn good with Photoshop, is also Central American, Read the Forbes article and then orchestrated a very elaborate and well researched prank.\n\nThat scenario isn't impossible but it's very unlikely. Most trolls go for the low hanging fruit and this is anything but.\n\nThe odds of this being the work of a very lucky troll who isn't from Central America is absurdly low. Too many details that feel wrong to Americans but Track by Central America logic.\n\nHonestly I really do get the sense that OP is exactwho he says he is, but new to reddit and as such does not know proper redditquette and does not properly know how to defend his claims. Which is exactly what I would expect from a A 25 year old Central American prodigy, as skills in one area of life do not translate into skills in others by default. Being a god at business networking don't mean jack shit on reddit, and I think he's learning that the hard way, which is a very 25 year old thing to do, prodigy or no. Seriously all prodigy means is that he's very good at his specialties. Despite popular opinion otherwise, prodigies are generally average to below average outside of their areas of expertise. So the whole narrative very strongly tracks in his favor.\n\nWhich means yes. The largely usa/ north American reddit user hivemind probably fucked up on the comments here. I started on team skeptic but am officially joining team Stan. Most Americans never leave the USA and even the odd brit or Aussie here is unlikely to have gone to central or South America. So cultural biases throwing off the hivemind bullshit detector also tracks\n\nLiterally every angle I look from, Op's story tracks. So yeah I think he's the real deal",

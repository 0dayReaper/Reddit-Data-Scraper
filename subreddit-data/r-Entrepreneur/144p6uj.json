    "postText": "I\u2019m 25 - environmental science grad. I\u2019ve found myself in a strange film job that I\u2019ve worked for 7 months. I want to start my own business in the sustainability realm. I am currently underpaid for my skill set and really want to start this business. \n\nHowever, my job is too draining and I\u2019m always knackered to build the company. I have the luxury of being a trained chef (worked whilst studying at uni) wages have gone mad at the moment (UK) for chefs. \n\nI can work agency for 2 days a week and earn the same as I do now. However, I am terrified of quitting my current job. Which would eventually lead to a well paid salary. If my company failed, I would be 7months into a starting job and back to just cheffing. Which I never wanted as a career. Terrified as to what decision I should make.",

Build your brand, and by brand I mean yourself. Polish off your skill set. Learn new trade. Do the things other people aren't doing. Most importantly, save and invest (not necessarily monetarily) INTELLIGENTLY. \n\nI've been hustling many creative ways since I was 17. Moved out after I graduated early and couponed/pinched every single penny. Bought my first house at 23. Sold it for 54k profit 4 years later. Paid cash for the brand new mobile home that we live in now on 80 acres of farmland. Took me 8 years to complete a 4 year degree. But on 5/31/23 I was able to quit my corporate fintech job with 100% financial stability still in tact because we budget our bills from my husband's salary; mine was just paying off debt, travel, etc. Have a few interviews lined up over the next two weeks, but I also have the freedom to say that if not a single one of them work out, my bills are paid/ahead for the next 6 months at least. \n\n\nWork hard now, pinch the pennies and be uncomfortable now to be comfortable later.",

Maybe instead of thinking about quitting cold turkey, you could transition to part-time or freelance work while you build your business? It's scary to take risks, but sometimes they pay off big time. Best of luck to you!",

    "postText": "**THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL**\n\nMy Bachelor's studies will begin in a few months. I have been trying to start an online occupation as a side hustle for quite a while now, but I have failed in all the different things I tried to to. The problem is that I start to learn something and later on realize that it won't be worthwhile and I drop it for something else entirely. If someone else has been through such events, I would really appreciate your guidance.",

You need to snap out of it and realize you are not a slave to your thoughts, your emotions, your feelings.\n\nThe best thing you can learn in life is how to accomplish hard things. It will teach you willpower, perseverance, self confidence, resourcefulness.\n\nYou are focusing on the \u201cthings you learn\u201d but what you are neglecting are the self learning.\n\nYou could finish a bachelors degree in geography and then go on to be an entrepreneur, and all the lessons you learned about yourself, your work ethic, time management, etc will all play a huge role in your success even if what you end up doing has nothing to do with geography at all.\n\nPeople just LOVE to fantasize the idea of the college drop out who goes on to become Jeff Bezos, but what they don\u2019t understand is that you only HEAR the story of the college drop out who became Jeff Bezos.\n\nNobody tells the story of the millions of people who dropped out to follow that same path and lived in a bachelor apartment by the airport for the rest of their life.",

Don\u2019t roll the dice where bankruptcy and financial destruction is the most likely result. \n\nJust work a part time job if you need cash. A business is FAR from guaranteed income especially when you\u2019re in college. \n\nPlus the opportunity cost you\u2019d be sacrificing is more study time (better grades) and actually gaining the knowledge you\u2019re paying to obtain at school.",

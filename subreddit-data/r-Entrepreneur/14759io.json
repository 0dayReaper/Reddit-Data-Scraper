    "postText": "Hi all. So I\u2019m in a need of some advice as I\u2019ve been assigned to do the marketing part on behalf of my partner and his colleague who have started doing tiling work.\n\nI\u2019ve created a website, social media presence, excel spreadsheets to keep track of spending and income, etc. However my partner seems to insist that I start contacting potential clients myself. \n\nTo be honest it feels quite weird as I\u2019m a woman in my mid 20s, have a somewhat young girl voice and I know nothing about tiling. I imagine it\u2019s also weird for people to have someone other than the tiler contact them. That said I don\u2019t feel confident in speaking to arrange a meeting as it\u2019s not me they\u2019re meeting with. I feel like it\u2019s an extra step that is not needed as my partner could contact them himself and earns their trust in doing so.\n\nWould it be awkward to people if I call them to arrange a chat in person? Side note we are not a business, however it is somewhat of a start up, we are hoping it leads us somewhere. Thanks in advance.",

If anything, it makes the company more professional and shows you actually value communication. In the trades, companies that communicate win, even when their price is higher. \n\n2. Your company will seem larger and more established than if they are just calling some guy who's name was on his truck. There are tons of that guy, far fewer companies large enough to have someone actually answer the damn phone.\n\n3. Wives, the real decision makers, will be relieved they are talking to you instead of the contractor. Tradesmen are great do'ers, few are good talkers. \n\n\nFinally, use your womanhood to your advantage. You have easier access to decorators and designers than male competitors. Get into their vendor lists and you will be supplied with high end work without having to go hunt it down every friggin time.\n\nMy family's faux finish and wallpaper business has been fronted by my MIL for 20+ years. No one has ever flinched at speaking with her instead of my Dad who does most of the actual work, or my BIL who is as useful as a Flaming Cheetos dildo, but that's a different story.",

I can\u2019t make up a script.\n\nI called a client once and it turned out to be a construction company needing an extra hand so I kinda made a fool of myself. They repeatedly said they can\u2019t take on businesses but individuals on their payroll. (They thought I was a receptionist of some sort) I was trying to communicate that we are not a limited company but a team of 2 tilers and I\u2019m doing the marketing and communication for them (since they were busy on a job) but he couldn\u2019t get it. \ud83d\ude05",

                            "comment": "Regarding that particular call, the construction company was telling you they do not hire other businesses, only individuals. It's very common in the trades for one business to hire another business to do the physical work, or part of the work. This is called sub-contracting. This would be a 1099 position.\n\nThe construction company was saying they only hire individuals, who would be direct employees of the company. In this situation, no one works for themselves, they are all employed directly by the construction company. This is a regular employment situation, a W-2 position. \n\n1099 and W-2 are tax designations. 1099 allows you to control your schedule, you can work anywhere, anytime, and are not bound by the hiring company policies outside your contract. W-2 employees only work for the hiring company, are bound by all the rules of the hiring company, and everything is controlled by the hiring company.",

If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for you to do it, maybe you or they are missing something.  If you just don\u2019t feel comfortable yet with the trade, then maybe you work with them to get comfortable so you can support the person supporting your family.\n\nIf you have a full time job already, then I think there\u2019s more of a discussion of whether you should, as opposed to getting you prepared.",

To me marketing and direct communication with clients sounds like two different things. \ud83d\ude01 I\u2019ve already done all I could regarding online presence and business cards. My degree is in graphic design and I\u2019m just getting into (digital) marketing now as I find it quite more interesting and rewarding. I want to help them however I can for sure! \n\nWhat I struggle most with is how to communicate with potential clients to arrange a meeting in person to check out the job. I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m a scammer since we are not a limited company/business yet. I\u2019m also not native to this country so I have a slight accent and I don\u2019t want this to put them off combined with my tiny voice. My partner and his colleague have only done a couple jobs so far to get their foot through the door. I have also added another comment where I give an example of my failed interaction lol",

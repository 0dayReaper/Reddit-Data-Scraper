    "postText": "A couple years ago I started a window covering business (selling/installing blinds and shades) but I'm struggling to go anywhere. I've tried carpet bombing entire new construction neighborhoods with flyers/coupons, called just about every interior designer and builder in town, I have a website but it's buried about 20 pages deep into the search results, and every marketing/SEO expert or company I've talked to is out of my price range. I tried running google ads but it just let google take thousands of my dollars and didn't get me any leads. Starting to feel kinda hopeless about it and just don't know where to go from here, hoping to get some advice from someone who has been in a similar spot.\n\nIf you downvote this post, at least tell me why or offer some advice....",

I can definitely do better at wearing my companies logo more often, and unfortunately I'm not very socially outgoing and probably wouldn't strike up a convo with a stranger.",

That means, in addition to some basic internet presence, you need to sell, face to face, everywhere you go.  If you don't, some one else will.  I like business people like you, easy to outsell, because you're not selling.  People want and need your product but they're not gonna come looking for you, you have to go looking for them.  It's a numbers game, and if you don't hit the numbers...guys like me will.  Because we're dead fucking serious about our business...and we're not afraid to sell.",

I ask nicely (my customers love my service, been in customer service all my life) and about 30% do a review. All 5 star.

They have the finances and incentive to improve their homes. \n\nBuy a thousand, yes, 1000 door hangers, loose your fears and walk neighborhoods. Talk to people, make new friends. You have business cards, right?\n\nAbc window covering shirts 24/7\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to fear but fear itself!!!",

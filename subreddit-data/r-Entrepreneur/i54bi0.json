    "postText": "For the following reasons:\n\n1) overly positive and upbeat all the damn time\n\n2) emotionally exploitative posts like \"2008. I was living in a rundown apartment after my parents abandoned me due to my alcoholism...\" \n\n3) cringey statuses like \"Reinventing Finance 1% at a time | Extraordinary Husband | Trailblazer in the Kitchen | Apptrepreneur\"\n\n4) \"if you don't come out of this quarantine with a new skill or job, you are WASTING this opportunity!\" during a time of record unemployment \n\n5) shameless, absolutely shameless self-promotion \n\n6) People who leave their jobs and write 5 paragraphs thanking everyone and anyone at their last company for being their best friends, close family, donated a kidney, etc. If it was truly that great, why are you leaving?\n\n7) \"HUSTLE AND GET THAT $$\"\n\n8) Posts about exercising and working out in the gym. How is this even business related?\n\n9) PASSIVE INCOME. GENERATE CASH FLOW! INVEST IN REAL ESTATE! Poster has zero real estate experience and does not have any investing credentials.\n\n10) **none of them are actually rich, successful, or have any proven track record** yet they seek so much attention\n\n11) Pointless platitudes that are marketed as courageous but in reality are just common sense. \"You should be paid what you are worth at your company\". 20,000 upvotes. No shit. \n\n12) Inspirational posts about how Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos once started off as not rich. Now, they are rich. Conveniently leaves out both of them were already incredibly successful and extraordinary people by the time they started their respective ventures. \n\n13) \"HERE'S HOW YOU BECOME A MILLIONAIRE: Sell a product for $100,000 ten times. How do you sell a product for $100,000? Create something that is worth $100,000.\" Wow, why didn't I think of that?\n\n14) Posts about waking up at 4:30 AM to \"get shit done\". No. That's what my day is for. \n\n15) First statement. New line. Second statement. New line. Third statement. New line...\n\nThe proliferation of social media marketing has reached a boiling point where consumers are inundated with annoying \"hustlers\" who peddle subpar products and misleading advice. It's useless at best and outright deceitful at worst. On average, it's become incredibly annoying.\n\nEdit: Will update list if I think of anything else.",

There were some avenues to pursue small grants for funding, maybe I should look there again. \n\nThen again, I just don't have any ideas these days, my brain feels like mush half the time and I just want to turn my brain OFF, not put it into fifth gear to grind 100 hours of week on a passion project.

They use it themselves and make a shit load of money. The core advice any of them will give you, though, is this simple formula: X experience + Y opportunity + Z luck = success. Some of the most successful people you will meet modestly tell you that they were in the right place at the right time, or the knew the right people to get started. None of them will tell you \"YOU NEED TO START A DROPSHIPPING COMPANY YESTERDAY!\"\n\nAs the devil's advocate, though, I will say that not everything the gurus say is wrong. Creating a passive income stream is something you should work toward regardless of what you do for a living. In my experience though, you are best to stay as fucking far away from residential real estate as possible; commercial is better if real estate is your route to passive income. Developing new skills can be beneficial. Those skills, though, need to be something that helps you personally, not just something that looks good on a resume. Exercise and diet not only make you physically healthier, but help improve your cognitive function. You don't need to look like a greek god/goddess, but rather follow what science says to live a healthy life. The only thing is, you don't need to pay $1,500 for a \"hOw tO gEt rIcH lIkE mE\" entrepreneurship 'course' to learn all that.",

    "postText": "I want to create a pair of pants. That's it for now. Nothing fancy, but it will be a cut and sew job. I want to use high quality cotton. The furthest I've gotten is researching. My plan is to:\n\n1. Find a designer on Upwork to get the design made\n2. Find a cut and sew drop shipper. Anyone know a good one? If this is a bad idea?\n3. Set up a store front through Shopify and then advertise on social media. Is there a better store front site service to use? \n\nAny resources anyone has that could help me learn more about this process would be great. If my budget is way too low please call me out. Been trying to learn more about this over the past few months but it seems that its all either drop shippers that will put your brand on stuff that's already made or it's people/groups with much deeper pockets that can order large quantities, hold them in a warehouse and ship them themselves.",

Some not a whole lot, but don't want my apartment filled with pants waiting to be shipped and don't want to have to anticipate what sizes might be ordered. Hoping I can find a place that will make good, high quality pants and can drop ship them as orders come in. Think this might be a pipe dream, but going to give it a shot.",

Drop shipping margins are disgustingly low. Like you pay $30 to make $35.\n\nMerch/clothing/hats is only a tiny portion of my business, though. For me drop shipping made zero sense. I have to sell about half of my stock to break even and typically sell out. But I keep orders relatively trim and hype up releases through my modest social platforms and newsletter.",

            "comment": "Absolutely doable with 5K. In Turkey, Iran, India, etc.. the cost of making a unit of denim pants for the manufacturer is less than 5 USD, with first grade cotton.  \nGiven that there's no economy of scale for 1 single pair of pants, you would probably be charged way more if they were willing to produce only 1 pair with your design. Wouldn't see this being more than 50 USD though. \nAlternative to mas manufacturers is using independent weavers - there are some great artisans in the counties mentioned above. The term they use for the jeans they produce is \"craft jeans\".\nShipping is peanuts and I am not sure about design, but again I wouldn't say it's more than 200 USD from a good designer in a second/third world country (I got my dream wedding dress designed and handmade by a top Kosovo designer for 800 EUR in 2019). \nAll in, I think you can accomplish this for less than 500 USD",

    "postText": "Over the years, I've gathered some knowledge about transitioning from a startup founder to a CEO. I started my company 7 years ago. We are now not super big (65 people), but we have learned a lot. We raised $19M in total and we are now profitable.\n\nThe transition from Founder to CEO was crucial. Your startup begins to mature and scale and you need to scale with it. It's often a challenging phase, but I've managed to summarize it into five habbits.\n\n**1. Say no to important things every day**\n\nBeing able to say \"no\" to important tasks every day is an essential practice for a growing leader. It's a reality that as the magnitude of your company or ideas expands, so does the influx of good ideas and opportunities. However, to transform from a mere hustler to a true leader, you have to become selective. This means learning to refuse good ideas, which is crucial if you want to consistently execute the outstanding ones.\n\nThe concept that \"Startups don't starve, they drown\" resonates deeply because it underlines how challenging it can be to reject opportunities.\n\nA key strategy to develop this skill is time-constraining your to-do list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n* Weekly: Formulate a weekly to-do list, including only those tasks that you're sure to complete within the week. Leave some buffer room for unexpected issues. If there's any doubt about whether you'll have time for a certain task, it should not feature on your weekly list. I use **Todoist** and **Notion** for task management.\n* Daily: Apply the same rule while creating your daily to-do list. Only include tasks that you're confident about accomplishing that day. If a task seems too big to fit into one day, break it down into manageable chunks.\n\n**2. Journaling**\n\nJournaling is a powerful strategy that can help an individual transition from a reactive approach to a proactive one. As founders, we often find ourselves caught up in a cycle of endless tasks, akin to chopping trees in a dense forest. However, to ensure sustainable growth, it is crucial to develop an ability to \"zoom out\", or to view the bigger picture.\n\nI use The Morning Pages method, from Julia Cameron. It consists of writing each morning about anything that comes to mind. The act of writing effectively combines linear, focused thinking with the benefits of a thoughtful conversation. If you just want to journal, you can use **Day One app** (The free version will be enough)**.** If you want to go a bit deeper, you can try **a coaching app**. I use **Wave.ai** and I also hired it for the managers in the company because it combines both journaling with habit building. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Building Robust Systems and Processes (I know, it is boring and founders hate this)**\n\nAs a founder, you often need to wear multiple hats and juggle various roles. But as a CEO, it's vital to establish strong systems and processes that enable the business to function smoothly, even without your direct involvement. This includes:\n\n* Implementing project management systems.\n* Establishing clear lines of communication and accountability.\n* Designing efficient workflows and procedures.\n\nTo many founders, developing these systems might seem monotonous or even tedious. After all, the allure of envisioning the next big idea often proves more exciting. I experienced the same predicament. In response, I brought onboard a competent COO who excelled in systematizing processes. This strategy allowed me to kickstart initiatives and explore them in a flexible, less structured manner. Once an idea showed signs of gaining traction, my COO stepped in to streamline it, crafting a process that turned the fledgling idea into a consistent business operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Meditating**\n\nMeditation is about reprogramming unconscious mental processes by repeatedly performing fundamental tasks with a distinct intention. This practice can be even more crucial to leadership than acquiring a business school education. Because meditation provides the most direct route to understanding your mind's workings and thus, forms the most effective basis for transforming it.\n\nTo transition from a founder to a CEO, a significant shift in your mindset is required. This shift involves moving from a hustle mentality to precision, from acting as a superhero solving problems to consciously stepping back, thereby providing room for your team members to discover their own superpowers. It's about shifting your success indicators - from individual achievements to the triumphs of your team. This transformation might not feel comfortable initially, and your instincts, shaped by your scrappy founder phase, might resist this change.\n\nHowever, with consistent practice, you can align your instincts with the stage of your company, promoting more effective leadership. This is where the value of meditation truly shines. It allows you to identify your distinct thought patterns in real time and, over time, modify them.\n\nI use **Headspace** a lot, and I also encourage the employees to use it. The company pays the subscription as a perk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Balancing the Macro and the Micro**\n\nAs the CEO, your primary focus should be on the big picture \u2013 your company's vision and strategy. However, you also need to keep an eye on the details, as these can make or break your execution. It's all about balance:\n\n* Delegate the details but stay informed.\n* Prioritize strategic planning but be ready to dive into the trenches when needed.\n* Keep your eye on your long-term vision but adapt to short-term realities.\n\nThe transition from founder to CEO isn't about giving up what made you successful initially but augmenting it with additional skills, perspectives, and practices. It's a personal and professional evolution that can lead to greater success for both you and your business.\n\nEvery great CEO was once a founder. It's just about taking the next step.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your experiences or any tips you might have for this transition.\n\nIn which step of your journey are you right now? Do you have employees already? What are your main challenges right now?",

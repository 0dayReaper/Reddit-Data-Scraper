    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I\u2019ve always had a passion for starting my own business. But I have a habit of talking myself out of starting due to a lack of self-confidence. I\u2019m an accomplished CPA and also have an MBA. So I understand the theoretical approach to business as well as the financial background that help it to run. \n\nI decided to challenge myself in helping my parents\u2019 grow their existing destination weddings business. The business has been around for several decades but due to my folks not investing in the business over the years they\u2019ve lost market share. A year ago I made a new website that is mobile user friendly, recently contracted an SEO specialist and established social media pages. I am struggling to get traffic to the website and social media pages. Would appreciate any guidance in this arena. \n\nOnce I\u2019m able to elevate the business I will prove to myself that I can be successful in starting and managing my own business.",

You should always proceed with caution when utilizing SEO specialists, you need to know enough to know what you do not know to prevent wasting money. The best guidance in this arena is to realize that your website is a tool to improve other forms of marketing. There are other ways to grow this business that are more cost-efficient.  DM me if you like to discuss your business in more detail.",

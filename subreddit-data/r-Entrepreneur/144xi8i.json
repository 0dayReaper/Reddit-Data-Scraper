Go to industry events, start-up pitches organised by incubators, and any other event where you are likely to meet investors. Do research and get people you know to introduce you to anyone you would like as an investor/adviser; alternatively do child reach-outs. While I would advise to be selective and mindful with who you shortlist as an investor, if you want to bank on luck, you could also try places where people with risk-seeking tendencies are likely to hang out. This would be your high-end casinos, expensive clubs, high-rate marinas, etc etc. Basically, someone that is willing and open to splurge on luxury is generally likely to be open to bet on a new idea.",

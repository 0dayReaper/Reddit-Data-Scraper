There will always be a percentage that get by doing the opposite. I have met genuine con men a few times in my life and they basically burn through relationships and have to keep going. \n\nThe examples I referred to earlier get one sale out of someone, where as businesses of integrity get a lifetime of repeat orders. \n\nPeople don\u2019t like someone like Jeff Bezos, but when it comes to the checkout people on-mass buy based on price and it\u2019s their purchases and his ability to keep making it easy for them to do so that make him rich. But look how much more respected Warren Buffett is, globally known for his integrity.  \n\nI should point out that I don\u2019t know where you live, and I am not in the US. But alternative economic systems to capitalism are even more fraught with problems. For example, south East Asian economies where certain families or elites or particular races control everything do not lead to better outcomes for the average citizen. In Africa, Zimbabwe under Mugabe showed another example where taking from incumbent rich and distributing based on revenge can cripple an entire society, turning a breadbasket country into  starvation.",

People earnestly had a skill they wanted to teach, and were happy to make some money on the side.   There was one person who joined Udemy as an employee who\u2019s now big in the get-rich-quick online course world.  She started moving instructors to a more aggressive marketing process.  Instead of teaching \u201cJavaScript Fundamentals\u201d I was encouraged to teach, \u201cGet Rich with JavaScript.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t do it.  Still don\u2019t, and I earn a very respectable living.\n\nWhile Udemy has recovered, it soon turned in to a cesspool of get rich quick content (and some good courses on baking.)\n\nAs the build-your-own-school companies like Teachable came along, they immediately saw where the dollar signs were.  They pumped out hopium dealers teaching people to get rich playing piano and collecting belly button lint.\n\nAt this point some of the big, professional scam artists like Anthony Robbins, and Tim Ferris\u2019 started talking about online courses as a way to get rich.  Pat Flynn all of a sudden became an online course guru.  The podcast guy\u2014 Dumas\u2014 was another sudden online course expert.  Everyone, whether they had any expertise or not, was teaching crap online.\n\nBy Russell Brunson\u2019s own statistics about 1 in 1,000 have earned over a million with ClockFunnels.  (He accidentally let this slip in an email a couple of weeks ago.) That means 999 failed and few got close.  About half those problem are selling online courses.  If you listen to Brunson\u2019s marketing you\u2019d think everyone was rich...\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of legitimate online education and online education companies.  I am proud to see the courses I author, or produce, used in large companies, school classrooms and individual homes.  I feel like I teach with integrity and the state of the industry makes me nauseous.",

And the Russell Brunson/Clickfunnels courses are for taking your existing business or idea and selling it online.\n\nThe issue is not the teachers here. It's the students.\n\nThe student watches a Tony Robbins course about teaching what you're an expert at. Maybe they bought the course too early. Maybe they don't take the time to examine their past and find something they're actually great at.\n\nThey go for the easy fix - \"Oh, what am I good at? I guess I'm good at hyping people up and motivating them. I'll just do what Tony Robbins is doing\"\n\nThat's what leads to a lot of these cloned courses\n\nIt's like if you bought a Javascript course using the example of how to build a Pong-like game, and you decided that your game is also Pong.\n\nOr you take a screenwriting course that examines The Matrix, and you decide to write a clone of The Matrix\n\nThat is not the teacher's fault",

Same with Steve Pavlina. His website and blog absolutely wreak of self-important delusional bullshit that his fans feedback on him, and he takes as a sign that he's correct w his content lol. My favorite article he ever wrote is \"Jobs are For Stupid People\", where he basically openly shits on everyone that doesn't do what he does, lmao.",

You can also do what clickfunnels does much cheaper with different and better software. Also of the people that made 1 million through their funnels how many of those were profitable?

You can have the best course in the world - and many have been created, on almost every topic.\n\nEven with the best possible content you will not see a massive success rate.\n\nWhat's the difference between the 1% of coders that make it and have careers vs. the 99%?

After they had some success with HTML and CSS, I'd move on to JavaScript.  By creating an actual context for learning, people were more successful.\n\n(2) I learned how adults learn.  Thanks to joining professional organizations like the Learning Guild and reading books like Design for How People Learn ( [https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter-ebook/dp/B018OJP5QW/ref=sr\\_1\\_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=adult+learning+julie&amp;qid=1590076117&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter-ebook/dp/B018OJP5QW/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=adult+learning+julie&amp;qid=1590076117&amp;sr=8-2) ) I used actual instructional design strategy.\n\n(3) Related to #2 we offer both validation and ascendancy.  Most who teach online offer a course as an \"end-all.\"  We provide validation through certifications that appear on LinkedIn (we've issued over 10,000 at this point), and ascendancy through \"earning\" more complex, advanced level classes.\n\n(4) We knew we were doing \"training\" not \"education\".  We spent more time on practical do-it-now outcomes than on theory, history, or larger context.  We teach the skills and let them run.\n\n(5) We realized people learn by doing, not by watching.  In a typical online course  people watch videos.  In our courses, we focus on activity.  Our members spend much more time \"doing\" than watching.  Here's a typical lab exercise from one of our courses:  [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQv969WVCpZ5pTZR2nTcrRcBC4ppClMxeoIrLveDtbw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQv969WVCpZ5pTZR2nTcrRcBC4ppClMxeoIrLveDtbw/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n(6) We created a supportive online learning community.  People feel affiliated with us, our cast of instructors and our community.  Activity in Slack is 24/7.  Questions are answered within minutes.  Free events a couple of times a week get people together on Zoom.  We're email new videos and content daily.  Here's an \"extra\" video we put out:  [https://vimeo.com/390589091](https://vimeo.com/390589091)\n\nThere's more to it than this, but this is a high level outline. Hope this answered your question.  Feel free to get in touch.",

It's not a course per se, but the 'Start here' section of Farnam Street, or Seeking Wisdom, gives you the foundational pieces that help all the mental models they discuss fit into place. Just picking 5-6 mental models along the way seems completely counterproductive. \n\nOn the other hand, I spend a lot of time learning growth tactics. I definitely don't need to be taught a comprehensive theory of growth (because it's simple), but I definitely want to have awareness of the best tactics available to me when I'm trying a given channel. That's where a habit of learning specific stuff ad-hoc comes in handy.\n\nChoosing what topic merits what kind of attention though, that's a hard problem.",

I usually have at least a few on the go. There are so many great courses out there that go way deeper than what you can find online. Online courses are a way to fast track a result, get some accountability, and in many cases, increase your network. I\u2019ve gotten so many clients and customers from people I\u2019ve met from other courses I\u2019ve taken.\nI can trace a lot of revenue from these communities! I\u2019ve met so many incredible people and connections, and if you actually do the work and show up, you often become part of the inner circle with the instructor, which can lead to even more interesting connections.\nI\u2019ve taken video editing courses, cooking courses, marketing courses of all kinds, copywriting courses, gardening courses, speaker training courses...\nThere\u2019s just so much great stuff out there that has brought legit value to my life. I happily invest money in courses every month.",

Probably but it's easier to just spend a bit and have a path that works laid out for you. I guess it depends. I think most people feel like if they just sign up for something they should get the benefit of it without doing the work.

I try to watch videos,  try to take out the important things, and when i start to believe or be interested in something, they fail me and fuck me over with their money bait schemes.   \n\n\nI do not believe you can become a millionaire from one day to another, you need commitment, will power, knowledge, time, patience and the ability to learn from your mistakes and to improve on them.

What they don\u2019t share is their Facebook ad expenses (e.g. the annoying ones you seem to be targeted with \ud83d\ude02), affiliate payouts, contractor/freelancers they\u2019ve hired and after all of that, they could be pocketing a fraction of what they\u2019ve claimed to make. \nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with people sharing their launch success or even wanting to teach people how to scale their business with online courses but I do think it\u2019s important not to sell people on something that seems easy to attain without any work/time involved or pretending like you\u2019re making a million dollars just to get other people to buy your products :)",

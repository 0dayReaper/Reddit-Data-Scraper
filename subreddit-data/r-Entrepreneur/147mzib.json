    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nI'm sure the answer to this is extremely simple but I'm having a bit of a brain fart so maybe someone can help! \n\nI'm in the process of developing a membership club for a niche market in which I already have a large audience for through another business of mine. My customers will receive discounts and perks from a number of vendors mostly upon presentation of their membership cards as it's mainly leisure, hospitality based. \n\nThough should I wish to partner with products in a retail space how would I offer and how would my customers redeem the offer with the third party? (I won't hold the stock) For example let's say my members get 20% off a brand of bag. What's the best way to execute this? I feel like something as simple as a discount code would be too easy to distribute to non-members, and I'm struggling to think of alternatives. So any ideas would be greatly appreciated! TIA!",

But what's to prevent the member from buying at a discount on behalf of their friend? \n\nThe \"perk\" needs to still be profitable for the merchant. The trade off is the cost of customer acquisition. Rather than spend 10-20% of the cost of the product on getting the customer to buy, your membership does the legwork and drives traffic to the merchant.",

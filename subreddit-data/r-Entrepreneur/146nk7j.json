All young entrepreneurs are posting for, you guessed it, other young entrepreneurs. Want downvotes? Then disturb any online culture oozing conformity from every pore.\n\nThe alternative view is uncomfortable. Any hint of a discussion rather than an echo chamber is distasteful. That is why suveys are used much as a drunk uses a lamp post ... support, not illumination.\n\nPeople want their own opinion, fed back to them. This is really what is meant when using the word \"Validation.\" It may be an unpleasant reality, but people avoid doing a search when they suspect a search engine won't tell them exactly what they want to hear. They won't search -- since they may be confronted with something they will not be able to dismiss out-of-hand. This [search blindness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/94qdvy/what_are_your_tier_1_problems/e3n07ve/) thing has gone [way past ridiculous](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/fgyy6u/why_has_this_type_of_business_not_been_started/). \n\nOne guy confessed he didn't want to know about competition. The problem he posted here was how to deal with superior competition whose products had much better product-market fit.\n\nWord definitions become co-conspirators. \n\n&gt;\"\u2018When I use a word,\u2019 Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u2018it means just what I choose it to mean \u2013 neither more nor less.\u2019 \u2018The question is,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018whether you can make words mean so many different things.'\"\n\nOften what were once useful words are twisted, bizarro-world opposites. \n\nDon't get me started with founder partnerships. Where the hard-hitting insightful question seems to be \"Would I get high with these guys, or not?\"\n\nEvery study out there explains how online groups of any kind quickly become platforms for unanimous, thick-witted, walled gardens of doctrinaire me-tooism. Few see these information pustules for what they are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Abstract: What is driving the declining quality of innovation-driven entrepreneurship? In this paper, we argue the growing entrepreneurship industry is an important yet overlooked explanation. This rapidly growing industry has transformed the nature of entrepreneurship and encouraged a particular form of low-quality entrepreneurship. It has done so by leveraging the Ideology of Entrepreneurialism to mass-produce and mass-market products that make possible what we term Veblenian Entrepreneurship. This is entrepreneurship pursued primarily as a form of conspicuous consumption. Aside from lowering average entrepreneurial quality, Veblenian Entrepreneurship has a range of (short-run) positive and (medium and long-run) negative effects for both individuals and society at large. We argue that the rise of the Veblenian Entrepreneur has contributed to creating an increasingly Untrepreneurial Economy. That is an economy which superficially appears innovation-driven and dynamic, but is actually rife with inefficiencies and unable to generate economically meaningful growth through innovation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Towards an Untrepreneurial Economy? The Entrepreneurship Industry and the Rise of the Veblenian Entrepreneur](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3479042)",

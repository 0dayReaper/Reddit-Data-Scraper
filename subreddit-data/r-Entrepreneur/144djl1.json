    "postText": "Whenever I start on a difficult project, I often run into hard roadblocks that I could get advice for if I had an experienced person in the field that I could meet with. I frequently find myself thinking, \"if only I could pay someone experienced to give me a rundown of how this works and what I need to do to fix it, I would be so much better off.\"  \n\n\nI've thought of creating a platform that allows people who have side-businesses and hustles to meet with others in their same field for specific advice or solutions. I'm not talking novice to expert where it's like a mentoring program, but where it's a brief meeting between you and someone more knowledgable within your specific field.  \n\n\n**Have any of you had similar thoughts? And would this be something you would use?**  \n\n\nThis could potentially double as a networking platform to meet higher-up people in your field for a steeper meeting price, etc.  \n\n\n**All feedback and criticism is welcomed!**",

Then i schedule short 15-30 min calls just to meet them and talk a bit. \n\nI think it would be difficult to scale / monetize your idea just with the \u201econnecting people\u201c USP\n\nMaybe it would work if the main reason for people to come on your platform is not the connecting part but something else that beings real value - as soon as the right people are on it, they may connect anyway.",

VCs (if you go that route) will ask themselves the same thing before investing so have a very well thought out answer. I know a couple people who tried to start a similar business, but gave up when they couldn't get funding. The current economic environment is not great so capital is very tight for the time being.\n\nDo you think it will be harder to find experts or people looking for expertise?\n\nWhat issues do you foresee with monetization?\n\nHow will you vet experts?",

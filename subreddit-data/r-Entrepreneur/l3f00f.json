She got my phone and sent it to herself via cashapp. A week before we were having conversation about the type of guys she likes and she says I'm too passive. She likes the kind of guy that people would be afraid of while walking down the street lol. I guess that should have been my red flag right there. In any event thankfully I caught it in time to call my bank and stop the transaction.",

The person who they stole from will spend his own money pursuing them.   \n\n\nBecause they were partners, almost always prosecutors will not prosecute them. The people who stole can fabricate a story just to confuse the courts, buy more time, and drive up the victim's legal expenses. The courts will almost always do nothing if the defendants perjure. That's right! You can perjure and there's no downside. The judge could make a bad decision based on a lie. Guess what the plaintiff's only option is? Spend more money appealing the decision. \n\nWhile the victim is spending time gathering evidence and trying to recover assets, the thieves are out prospering. They can invest in other businesses, stocks etc. Worst case for them is they settle for a fraction of what they stole. \n\nUS legal system provides minimal to no protection from this scenario. The only reason more people aren't stealing like this is not because the courts are amazing, it's because they choose not to.   \n\n\nThe old saying crime doesn't pay? Not true. Crime pays a lot.",

Someone can steal $250,000 and you can easily spend $200,000 trying to get your other $250,000 back.  Then they only have to declare BK, and it is all gone.  You are out every penny you had, and you probably lost your business in the process.\n\nSo in my opinion, what really matters is creating systems, processes, checks and oversight to make certain nobody steals the money in the first place.  That is what really matters imho.  \n\nThat said, all the other stuff is absolutely important, but none of that will stop someone from emptying the checking account, and if you prevent that, you are way ahead of the game.",

You can afford to be nice later when your business succeeds.\n\nIf you can't do all of the above or felt it's against your nature, then you'd do better if you don't have a business partner.",

All that he has to do is simply decide that he is not the circumstances in which he thinks he finds himself, but as I said the unmovable indestructible force that can find a solution to any challenge. Keep reminding him of this until he remembers it himself. Once he does the problem is over and the solution will arrive.",

He's not going to get justice which is traumatic. Meanwhile, his partners are prospering. That fact makes it even more traumatic.\n\nHe might need emotional support, therapy, medication, and if he doesn't have a lot of money, he might not be able to afford any of it.\n\nThere's no reason these things happen. There's no great life lesson to be learned. All he can do is control how he responds to this. The more he allows them to steal his thoughts, emotions, the more they continue to steal from him.\n\nTo stop this ongoing theft, he needs to cut his losses and focus on the future.

            "comment": "From my experience doing business with a close friend and my girlfriend in two separate businesses, it\u2019s best to pursue business on your own and hire employees or management along the way when they become necessary. Anyone that\u2019s hiring a \u201cfriend\u201d as a partner is doing so because they don\u2019t actually have a product and they think that friendship and security will make up for the fear of pursuing business for business sake.\n\nThat being said, the first few months of our business being In operation, I needed my partner. His girlfriend helped tie loose ends we had in the business (we couldn\u2019t manage a social media page and we were incompetent at baking), and my friend had a solid idea for general concept and also had a truck which was necessary for us to move equipment. Without both of them the beginnings would\u2019ve been nearly impossible. Or so I thought.\n\nFlash forward eight months into the business making money, I\u2019m paying out my share to my partner and paying a fair sum to his girlfriend, but I\u2019m realizing very quickly that I\u2019m the only one actually doing *business owner* tasks. I\u2019m soliciting business, dealing with insurance/business owners/licensing, and on top of that, everyone I meet has no clue I had a business owner because he was a consummate loner/shut in and would only appear to work on days of production (he wanted nothing to do with socializing or being in meetings. He would say that was \u201cmy job\u201d while he spent literal days playing 15+ year old PC games).\n\nThen I had this realization that I knew exactly what was required of my business and that I didn\u2019t need him or his girlfriend to be a part of it. In all honesty I didn\u2019t even have his name on the LLC documentation. But to add to the stickiness of the situation, they were my roommates, so to tell him I had no interest in having their part in the business would\u2019ve made the situation very difficult emotionally for all of us.\n\nTo top it all off, it was my idea and motivations that lead to the business getting off the ground to begin with. When we had heated arguments about me leaving the business, they took it as a personal attack that I wanted to leave and find a steady job because \u201cwe can\u2019t do it without you\u201d. My response was that *I could do it without them*. And that\u2019s the problem with taking on partners. They are often not as motivated as you, and they have everything to gain from your efforts. You\u2019re better off finding what you need from a partner and just paying someone cash to make up for your short comings, because you\u2019ll discover very quickly that what you needed from your partner could\u2019ve been solved from paying someone $100/week for a few hours of work instead of paying out over $10,000 in salary",

Pay yourself, get a business loan for growth and new expenses.

As sad as that was, it prompted my dad and his two brothers to come together with the intention of paying off the debt. It is because my grandfather did not want to die in debt but he did. So these three put their heads and skills together and somehow were able to clear the debt in a year. \n\nThey went on to make a whole empire of the same business in the next five years and the business is still going strong today. It has taken its beatings and changes and what not. But it has survived it all. I was involved in it as well for about five years.",

My practice is my business and it just doesn't make sense for me to eat the costs of litigation to help out another business (which, although wounded, is, I hope, still viable and turning a profit).\n\nPro bono arrangements are more appropriate for when the client is an individual of modest means. Alternatively, Op's dad might be offered a discounted hourly rate or favourable contingency/deferred payment plan.",

Hiring a CPA firm with a stellar reputation with third party auditing. Have liability, D&amp;O, and key personnel insurance. \n\nANYTHING that involves cash, c card, checks transfers of assets over a specific amount requires board, all owners, CPA, comptroller, division manager etc...approval. Some need all owners / comtrollers signature. Every transaction gets reviewed. Lots of checks and balances.\n\nGoing into business with anyone no matter how trusted, no matter how close... assume the worst may happen and put checks and balances in place. Don't ignore warning signs if you see them. Have difficult conversations. \n\nIf any rules / regs are broken then it's clear cut theft and a bunch of other types of white collar crime. Then insurance and the police / FBI get involved because laws have been broken.",

That's enough for an LLC, a website, basic equipment, and the other basic things needed to start a real business.  With literally $0, the best advice is to either get a loan or work a job until you have a few thousand saved up.  I've started 5 companies.  2 were decent for the goals I set for them.  2 never really got up and running.  1 has completely changed my life. None of them could have been started with $0, but all five were less than $5k.",

A friend of mine does this and he abandoned landscaping in favor of \"hardscaping\" - building patios, decks, outdoor living spaces, etc.  The profit margins are ~10x and the size and scale of the job is often ~100x.  So it's just a FAR better business.\n\nIt's fine to start out mowing lawns and trimming hedges, but to scale that enough would be a challenge.  You can make $50k by mowing 1000 lawns or by doing 2-3 patios/outdoor kitchens.",

    "postText": "With the advent of ChatGPT, I see an opportunity to finally consolidate worldwide wisdom into an objective set of structured guides, negating the need and risks associated with people seeking gurus online.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be an instruction manual, but an intuitive guide, directing us to original and accurate sources of material, related to the the challenges we input into it.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u201cI feel isolated and alone\u201d - rather than ChatGPT pretending to have the answer, it would simply link all relevant wisdom in response, maintaining a non-judgemental and objective perspective on the situation.\n\nIf this was put into an app (let\u2019s call it LilGuru), we could use it to navigate philosophy and theology without the hinderance of the author or presenters bias and/or ulterior motives for posting such wisdoms online.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t this happened already?",

But of course that they have their eyes shut certainly isn't helping.\n\nAnyway, most of the posts, questions and problems are about Supply and Demand. Mostly everything past the \"and\" part. Abject failure on the level of supply and demand doesn't need help, it needs a constant injection of miracles and a prayer circle. ...Maybe [an intervention](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyIdea/comments/7y2hs5/the_cargo_cult_intervention_post/).\n\nTesla takes preorders. The people with some Elon Musk quote nailed to a wall ...not so inspired.\n\nI think the current situation is fine, especially since my suggestion there should be a tax on naivete was rejected ... although they admitted it would bring in enough to balance the US Budget and begin to pay down the national debt.",

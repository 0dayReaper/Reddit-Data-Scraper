    "postText": "Eight months ago, I changed my life completely. I went from being severely depressed, unfulfilled, and frustrated, working 50 hour weeks, barely earning above minimum wage, to landing my dream job, and more than doubling my salary.\n\nI\u2019m sharing my experience because when I first began this journey, I would have loved to have heard a story like mine.\n\nAfter 7 years as a hairdresser, it became clear I was on the wrong path. Having always loved writing, I became determined to pursue a career in copywriting.\n\nThe problem was, I had no idea where to start.\n\nWhen I researched ways to transition into the industry, every resource said I\u2019d have to go back to college and study. I didn\u2019t want to waste another 3 years, accumulating enormous debt for a piece of paper that I knew wouldn\u2019t make a difference. I needed to find a different way to reach my goal.\n\nHere are the steps I took to change from hairdresser to copywriter, without a degree, and without an internship.\n\n**1. Shift your mindset.**\n\nI had to unlearn everything I thought I knew about how to build a successful career, starting with challenging the belief that I wasn\u2019t capable, or deserving of the career and life I truly wanted. These limiting beliefs mean most people just settle for a job they can tolerate, not the life they want.\n\nI read the work of many successful female entrepreneurs to learn about how they overcame their own self-sabotaging beliefs, as well as researching material online about how to handle \u201cimposter syndrome.\u201d I have an entire hype-board on Pinterest, purely to remind myself that I am deserving of a seat at the table.\n\n**2. Find a mentor**\n\nI \"apprenticed\" myself to my friend who is a successful entrepreneur and runs several digital businesses. Find someone who has been successful in the niche you\u2019re interested in and ask them for help. If you ask for help, the majority of the time, you\u2019ll receive it. Successful people have been where you are now. When someone who genuinely wants to achieve what they have, asks for help, they are almost always more than willing to give it.\n\n**3. Research**\n\nI researched on Goodreads to see which books were consistently mentioned as being the best across marketing and copywriting.\n\nThese included:\n\n* *Mastery,* Robert Greene\n* *Daily Rituals*, Mason Currey\n* *On Writing Well,* William Zinsser\n* *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook,* Joseph Sugarman\n* *Ca$hvertising,* Drew Eric Whitman\n* *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,* Robert B. Cialdini\n* *The Copywriter\u2019s Handbook,* Robert W. Bly\n\nA key part of my process with these books is to take notes as I go, and either create or find online, a book summary once I\u2019ve finished reading. I keep a Google Drive folder just for book summaries and I refer to them at least once a month to refresh my mind.\n\nI did one online copywriting course that I actually found here on Reddit, which turned out to be incredible. The thread is still up if you want to [check it out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/aiwymi/i_make_around_300000_a_year_as_a_freelance/)\n\n**4. Start TODAY.**\n\nI practiced as much as possible, journaling daily, writing on Medium, and submitting work to sites. I gained experience by working for my friend to practice working to a brief, following a word count, and meeting deadlines.\n\n**5. Cold-email small businesses.**\n\nI started cold-calling and cold-emailing small local businesses, offering my services for free to help gain experience and build my portfolio. I landed my first \\*legit\\* client this way. In \u201cInfluence\u201d, Cialdini talks about the principle of reciprocity \u2014  if you offer your services for free to a few people, it\u2019s likely that at least one of them will return the favor by offering you ongoing work.\n\n**6. Apply for jobs**\n\nI started applying for copywriting jobs. Initially, I never heard back from a single application, until I decided to leave my work history off my resume entirely. I think potential employers were seeing my history as a hairdresser and immediately concluding I wasn\u2019t qualified for the role. This tactic worked; I got a callback and they asked me to provide a writing sample. I knew I was up against 3 other top candidates, so I decided to go above and beyond \u2014 I didn\u2019t supply just one writing sample, I supplied 4 and explained how I would split test them to find the top performer. I figured no one else would go to that amount of effort, and my employer later told me that was true, no one else had. I had an interview and I got the job.\n\nLess than 6 months after that I became a freelancer, continuing to work with that company as my main client but with others on the side as well. Today, I work with a range of clients including social media influencers, brands, and small businesses.\n\nI don\u2019t expect to gain anything from sharing this, and I\u2019m not looking for new clients. I just thought some of you might feel inspired by this or find some of the steps I took useful.\n\nIf you do want to find me, I\u2019m on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/socialsquad.co/).\n\nAnd I have a [website](https://www.copysquad.co/) too.",

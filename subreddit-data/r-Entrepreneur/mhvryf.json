    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m a full-stack web developer from Poland and together with my twin brother, we built [FreeYourMusic](https://freeyourmusic.com/). FreeYourMusic allows you transfer your playlists across music streaming services, e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc. Most of our customers are simply people who want to switch to a different provider and take their playlists with them.\n\nI wanted to share with you how a small script I wrote for myself turned into a profitable business (the company is approaching 6 years).\n\n# How I came up with the idea\n\nImmediately after the release of Apple Music (in 2015), I really wanted to switch from Spotify so I could try it out. Usually someone develops a tool like FreeYourMusic, but after waiting 2 weeks I noticed that there still wasn\u2019t anything there.\n\nMoving 3000 songs manually would\u2019ve taken me hours, so I tried to figure out how to automate the process. After a few hours of playing with Apple Script, I created an app that literally just used the mouse to click things in iTunes: search for a song -&gt; click more -&gt; click to add music -&gt; repeat.\n\n# How the app works\n\nIt\u2019s really simple. First you log in with your account to one streaming service (for example Apple Music), and then you log into another (let\u2019s say Spotify). FreeYourMusic will then fetch all your playlists with song titles, author names, and albums from Apple Music. Then it will perform a search in Spotify with a little bit of magic to properly match songs, e.g. some services use \u201c\\[feat\\]\u201d and others \u201c(feat)\u201d. Once FYM has properly identified all the songs, it will create a playlist in Spotify.\n\nAdding multiple sources and destinations is always a bit tricky, as they are so different from each other!\n\n# Let\u2019s turn it into a business\n\nI figured what I built could be useful for others, so I made a small website and [posted it on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/s-t-a-m-p). At the beginning it was free, but people could donate money via a \u201cbuy me a beer\u201d button ;-) The first day I got reviewed in multiple newspapers and online magazines, got 20k unique visitors to the website, and made 97\u20ac in donations. I thought, \u201cAll of this because I made a small script after work? Nice.\u201d\n\nThen my brother said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s make it better and start selling it!\u201d So my brother Mike, our friend Chris and I, got together and spent all night creating a proper app. I think it was 5 A.M. when we released it. We got our first payment within 5 minutes and then went to sleep for a few hours.\n\nThings got crazy after that. I went back to work and saw people buying licenses all day long. We had so much stuff to do that I had to take a week off work. For the first few months we had to work 16 hours/day: half for our full-time jobs and the other half for FreeYourMusic.\n\n# How the revenue changed over time\n\nThe first month we made over 15,000\u20ac in revenue because of ProductHunt, but the next few months were much smaller (around 6,000\u20ac). Now, after over five years, our average monthly revenue is around 20,000\u20ac levels.\n\nWe\u2019ve experimented with different pricing models: it was 5\u20ac at beginning, then 12\u20ac, and after some tests we saw that a 9\u20ac price mark for FreeYourMusic works the best. In the meantime, we\u2019ve also added support for iOS, Android, and many new music services.\n\nThanks to FreeYourMusic, my brother and I were able to quit our day jobs and focus on building our own companies.\n\n# How we grew\n\nFrom the beginning we focused on having the correct SEO tags and all the basics. If you Google \u201cSEO website checker\u201d you will get ton of resources telling you what you are missing: meta tags, descriptions, fast loading, h1 tags, compressing etc. It all affects your Google ranking.\n\nAfter that it all grew organically. We were just constantly improving our apps and adding new services and platforms. We were also the first to support Apple Music playlist transfer via an iOS app, which was made possible with the iOS 9.3 update.\n\nThe real growth started when we realized that FreeYourMusic was a real business, not just a cash machine that would last for few months. After that, we started paying ourselves fixed salaries, but not too much. We kept lots of money in the company\u2019s bank account, and that allowed us to invest in the business. We\u2019ve hired more people to help us with the development, marketing and customer support.\n\nWe\u2019re constantly thinking about how we can improve FreeYourMusic so that users are happier. Right now we are launching a new service for music curators. It will help artists and brands to grow their audience with universal, [cross-platform playlists.](https://freeyourmusic.com/smart-links)\n\n# How we handled legal stuff\n\nFreeYourMusic was an overnight success, and we started making money on day 1, which forced us to open a company as soon as possible.\n\nFortunately, my parents had been self-employed, so I was accustomed to business. In Poland you can open your own company in less than a day, so I took few days off work and by the next day had opened the company. Then we incorporated Civil Law Partnership, which was basically a joint venture of all the founder\u2019s self-owned companies.\n\nWe had one problem with it, though. It was not a separate legal entity, and all liability would fall on us in case of any problems. People also trusted us less when they saw the weird \u201cpartnership\u201d in the company name. They are used to LTD\u2019s and Delaware companies. So in the following months we established FreeYourMusic LTD in the UK and moved everything there.\n\nAs for legal problems, we were always careful to not step on anyone\u2019s toes. The music business is really strict about their rights, so we made sure not to break any licenses.\n\n# Things we would do differently\n\n1. For sure we would have immediately started by using Electron to build a Windows/MacOS version based on one codebase. At the beginning we\u2019d been building separate native Windows app and native MacOS app. Then at some point we realized that it takes us too much time to copy features over to Windows (we had been focusing on MacOS). I\u2019m glad we had balls to say, \u201cLet\u2019s rewrite what we have in Electron so we will have one shared codebase (except in a few cases like iTunes proxy).\u201d\n2. We would have incorporated as an LTD at the beginning.\n3. We would have paid for proper logo and website design much earlier.\n4. We would have used Stripe instead of Braintree, because Braintree\u2019s bank closed our account as a result of them not understanding Spotify\u2019s SDK license.\n\nOf course we know all of this now, but when FreeYourMusic was starting, we had no idea how long it would last, so we were cautious to spend money.\n\nWe didn\u2019t quit our jobs *immediately*, just in case FYM failed, and I think it was a good call: You should not jump into deep water. You should first try it out slowly and run your business as side project. At the same time, you should see where it\u2019s going and make a decision quickly: my current job or my business. In hindsight, we should\u2019ve quit earlier.\n\n# Some advice on how to turn your side-project into a profitable business\n\nTo be independent, you have to make money to support yourself. If you have a project you\u2019re working on after work, but months have passed without it having any paying customers, that usually tells you that there\u2019s no market for it, or that you haven\u2019t focused on it enough.\n\nBefore FreeYourMusic, I created numerous projects that failed, and this is what I learned: All businesses have to make money, and you need to quickly kill the ones that do not. Treat your side project as any other business. If it doesn\u2019t make money after a few months, either change something in your product or kill it and start something new.\n\nAlso, outsource things that take a lot of your time but could be done by anyone. We wasted a lot of time replying to customer emails instead of improving the app.\n\nRead [everything from](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) Paul Graham. His writings contain so much knowledge and good advice that you\u2019ll be amazed.\n\nGo through stories of how other companies started. It\u2019s true when they say that almost every company has similar problems. For sure there is some company from the same vertical or with problems similar to yours which you can learn from.\n\nTalk to others. There are numerous Slack groups, Facebook groups, Quora questions, etc. You will be amazed how much others want to help you.\n\nDiversify. If we had kept focus limited to Spotify and Apple Music and only on MacOS, we would be much smaller or dead. Look around for market opportunities you are still not taking but that are easy to grasp with your product. For example, look at what Uber has done with delivering food. You can do the same even when you are quite a bit smaller than Uber ;)",

Android users expect things for free much more than Apple users. \n\nAlso, for 95% of users the app works and there is no review. \n\nThen for 5% it won\u2019t fully work or at all (bunch of different issues, sometimes Spotify is down and blame fall on us) and then we get 1 star. \n\nAll in all if it\u2019s great you tend to not leave a review. If it stops working you tend to immediately give 1 star. We always give a refund if we can, user just need to simply ask but it doesn\u2019t stop bad reviews coming in.",

They ask me right after I used the product successfully. For example, if I\u2019m booking a flight ticket, it asks me first if my experience was good. I say yes. It then asks to leave a review. \n\nIf my experience was bad and I say no. The app tells me to give feedback on what went wrong so we can fix it and give compensation (to me). This immediately blocks off a bad review on the AppStore as the user will give a piece of their mind in the feedback section of your app directly. \n\nI hope you\u2019re doing the same.",

Looking at the comments on the Android version - your responses are very canned and honestly very cold. \n\nYou need to put empathy into your responses and I don't see that. \n\nTell people you are sorry. Tell people that you apologize for the inconvenience that they've had using your app - OWN the problems but then come back and tell them what you will do.\n\nIt still might be a canned messaged but you're showing empathy to their issue, you're recognizing the inconvenience and you're telling them what you will do to make it better.\n\nFor example here is a response that someone left to a one star review:\n\nHi there, if you are experience an issue with transferring your music, please reach out to us at support@freeyourmusic.com. Our Support Team will help you with resolving the issue and will find proper solution to your case. \n\nI would have said something like:\n\nHi - Thank you for your feedback, and we're very sorry that our application did not work for you as intended. We'd really like to understand what happened so we can make it even better!  Please reach out to us at [support@freeyourmusic.com](mailto:support@freeyourmusic.com) \\- we'd like to turn your one star review into a five star review!\n\nYou're asking your users to \"test\" the application for you by giving you this feedback, offer them something in return. Maybe 50% off the basic purchase? Inclusion into a beta program.\n\nUsually your loudest critics are the ones that will offer the best feedback.\n\nI've spent the last 20 years in customer operations and have spent a lot of time writing and re-writing emails to clients that are unhappy with the product that our company sells. Taking the humble approach, combined with empathy and what we will do has helped us tremendously. We've gained more business from the clients that were not happy with us, and retained existing business because of this strategy. It works.\n\nOf course you will also have users that will still give you 1 star and a very negative review and you'll just have to live with those. We have those also - but at the end of the day when we go through a retrospective we know that we did whatever we could to save that client and use that information to further fine-tune our processes.",

Right know we can cover whole stack starting from mobile apps, websites and deployment/server ops so it\u2019s definitely easier to start any project for us. I heard good things about Bubble app maker but never tried it. We just code, eg. website is basically Bootstrap based theme build in NextJS with TypeScript. App is Electron React shared code base with React Native (so one business logic for all our apps, I so love 2021 tech!). Ahoy is Django/Python powered with front end React and native iOS apps (I would built it with React Native now and we even started project to rebuild it in RN but it\u2019s on Lise rig he now). \n\nMy recommendation for how to get into it would be: try building stuff while learning. I think JavaScript is the best way to go today. Easy to learn and you can build anything with it. There are bunch of courses online.",

Fast forward a year and a half, and Spotify released in my country. \n\nI wanted to make the switch back, but didn\u2019t want to have to manually copy my more up to date Apple Music library. \n\nAfter not finding anything that did such a thing, I actually thought about making it myself, as I have been experimenting and learning full stack web dev. I never did it, and essentially just lost my Apple Music library as I wasn\u2019t gonna continue to pay just to have time to copy my library over. \n\nSo I definitely understand the need.

One minor suggestion on your site, when I pull up the pricing, it automatically changes the dollar amount from $8.99 to $9.89, I can see this happen as the page is loading. If I stumbled upon this service, I would likely not purchase because of that. I suggest just charging $8.99 USD or $8.99 Euros, don't change based on location, at least between the EU and USA. Your likely missing out on a lot of customers by not sticking with the $8.99 price point in the USA. Hope this helps.",

We recently switched from Google Cloud to ScaleWay (love it). We never host our own persistence, so Postgres is managed by ScaleWay, Redis is ephemeral, files are on S3 compatible ScaleWay. I can recreate whole production in few minutes (thanks to Terragorm and Kubernetes). \n\nDesktop and Mobile apps are monorepo. \nDesktop app is Electron packaged \u201ccreate react app\u201d  and mobile is ReactNative. We basically write everything like any hooks or logic once and when we need to show UX we have separate components which differs only by one using &lt;div&gt; on desktop and &lt;View&gt; on Native. This saved us so much work, so we reuse this tech stack for other projects like Quizado. \n\nThis is new stack, we had literally rewritten everything last year April from scratch. I usually wouldn\u2019t recommend it but our tech was based on being script based mouse clicker to something more complicated. It was easier for us to rewrite everything to prepare for next years of development.",

I was wondering how you can guarantee 100% transfer of songs and playlists if perhaps you aren\u2019t able to find a song (e.g. Spotify \u2014&gt; Apple Music). How did you deal with instances where the names of a song were different between two music providers?",

Having mobile/desktop apps allows for much greater control of what is possible: eg. if the music service doesn't have API for login, we just display it's login page and get the cookies from there (so we don't ever touch user passwords, good example right now is Tidal), then we use their web app or mobile app APIs. \n\nSome services that we support wouldn't work on the web app.\n\nOn top of that, the mentioned services could try to block our requests based on Referral headers or other HTTP headers we couldn't spoof on the client side (as it's not possible to change everything on client side in browser due to security). \n\nYou could say \"why don't you run the request from your backend servers, then you can spoof any headers you like\". That's correct solution but then we are prone to be IP blocked by the services that don't want to allow our app to exists.\n\nHaving everything on Desktop app (or Mobile), where whole transfer happens on user device is less error prone: for Spotify it looks like the user is doing this manually from their mobile app (creating playlists etc), if the API is region based, then it works for the user as it should (eg. if our server would be in France, but user is in USA, and Spotify would base their API on location this would introduce problems). On top of it, we can get 1000x more users tomorrow and we won't have to scale servers at all as everything happens on user devices. It also feels just better privacy wise. I like to think to this solution as \"backend on the client\", or distributed backend, and while it has it's drawbacks, it has a lot of upside for us :)",

This usually works great, because there can be some variation in the metadata, but the song matches, but for some obscure songs it can be total miss. \n\nIf song doesn't exists on Spotify, and they don't return any result, we mark it as a no match, and you can see list of this songs in the app and you can try to add them manually. Usually it just doesn't exists, so no luck there even for manual work. \n\nWe are in the process of adding nicer UI to show the \"confidence level\" of our matching, so you can try to fix the matches manually from inside the app and then use this data to fix matching for other users as well, basically crowdfunding better matching data for all the users.

So you'd be able to set different prices per country (especially relevant for a product like yours, which is for consumers), and schedule different pricing tests so as to find out which pricing suits you best.\n\nI'm always curious to know how entrepreneurs price their things or adapt them \u2014 or more importantly, draw conclusions.

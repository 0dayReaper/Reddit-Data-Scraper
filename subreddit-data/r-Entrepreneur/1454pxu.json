It took me some time to understand that. This is a starting burger business located in Rio, which is growing very quickly and is proving itself to be very successful. \nThe revenue increased more than 4x since 2016 and is still growing. It aims to open 100 stores in Rio + S\u00e3o Paulo. \nBy their data, they have a profitable margin that ranges from 15 to 20% with returns after the first 12 mo average. All the current franchises from them are doing well.\nThe owner lives next to me, and we're talking a lot. A partner and I have enough capital for the acquisition and open a new restaurant in Flamengo, a very rich/bohemian/popular neighborhood in Rio. Also, we're building an extremely capable and experienced team to work and manage the restaurant with us, and themselves will be partners of the business. Our aim is to open several franchises, and this will be our first shot. 50% of the profit will be reinvested for asset expansion, and 50% paid as dividends after we have in cash 12x the monthly costs of each restaurant.\nAs investors, we want you to make part of the business, analyze curriculum, and take decisions as well.\nOur plan is to build an investor club starting with this single franchise. Having several brains and investors on the business will increase exponentially the chances of success and diminish the risks.\nWe don't want tremendously big investors, but regular people who are focused and determined looking for new opportunities.\nIn the beginning, we are not planning to have a club greater than 50 people, and a total investment of U$160k.\n\nMy role: I'll be administrating the franchise as owner, investing my capital as well and also manage the investment club. I have experience with a small cake business in the past, and currently, I work as an engineer in pipelaying vessel, which I'm responsible for managing the marine engineering, operation, finance and bureaucracy of this department.\n\nThe goal: Always looking forward. The focus is on the club and acquisition of several new franchises.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO MAKE PART OF THIS, SEND ME A DM AND LET'S KNOW EACH OTHER.\nIF YOU'RE JUST A CURIOUS TRAVELLER WITHOUT A SINGLE PENNY IN THE POCKET, PLS, DON'T FLOOD :)",

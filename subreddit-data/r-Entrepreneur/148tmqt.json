    "postText": "My plan to get to 10k monthly , \n\nCurrently, I offer a paid Facebook advertising service that targets specific niches. My goal is to help businesses generate leads, which ultimately result in appointments. The way my service works is that I charge per show, meaning that I connect potential customers to my clients through phone calls. I handle all the necessary work, from acquiring the lead to transferring the call to my client. All my client needs to do is speak to the lead and convert them into a hot lead. Additionally, my clients are responsible for covering the daily ad spend.\n\nI utilize a platform where I simply click a button once the lead has shown interest or started talking to my client. At that point, I charge my client for the service. Along with the pay-per-show model, I also provide a guarantee of delivering 10 appointments within 60 days, or I offer a 100% money-back guarantee. My clients pay a one-time setup fee and a fee per show. The majority of the work, such as lead generation and ad creation, is handled by me, minimizing the workload for my clients.\n\nI also use ai service to text the client to see if they did talk to  the client so no misunderstanding happen",

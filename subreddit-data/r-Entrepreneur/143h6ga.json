    "postText": "I'm a full stack developer with over 5 years of experience. In my 5 years of experience, I've co-founded a startup, worked for small startups, and also a huge company. Lately, I've been freelancing and building out web apps from scratch, and also MVPs for clients according to requirements, and I'm confident that I can put anything together given enough time and resources.  \nAny chance I can get hired in budding startups with a small team and a good idea, and stay with it as a developer to see it grow? I love to be a part of something that's just starting out and help grow the product!",

    "postText": "In the world of soft products (internet), it's entirely possible to create a product/service that costs $10/month with VERY little overhead. There must be at least 1,000 people worldwide who could give up $10/month fairly easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, some months I spend $50-$80 on lattes alone! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18% of Americans make over $100k per year. 34.4% of US households make over $100k per year. This is at least 46,494,000 Adults who have a $100k income or more. After estimated taxes, spending $10/month is only 0.15% of their net, take-home pay!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven these facts, why is it so hard to convince someone to spend $10/month? Or, more accurately, what is the tactic to get people to buy into this type of subscription?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a theory question, and has no straightforward answer, but I am curious what your thoughts are.",

I see it online all the time and it just kind of tricks you into thinking that its easy money. No, 1,000 people wont magically fall into your subscription. But yes, 1,000 will pay for something that gives them equal or greater value than the $10 they spend every month.",

Money is money, but it's not worth a damn if you're miserable everyday. \n\nAs for the tactic, it's finding the pain point. For example, if you can save them time, it's what they're willing to pay to get that time back. \n\nIf it's saving them money, then it has to be saving them more than if they did it themself. \n\nIf it's bringing them in more money for a service, it has to bring in more money than they're paying. \n\nThe goal is to benefit the other party. The hardest part over all of it, is gaining their trust. That's where authority and reputation come in. \n\nFor example if a homeless person came up to you and asked for $10, many people would say no, or go away. But if Dwayne The Rock Johnson came up to you and said, hey man, I need $10 and left my wallet, do you have it? Most people that have it would. For a couple of reasons. 1, it's a killer ass story to tell your friends and family. 2. You trust him because you've seen him so many times you feel like you know him. \n\nSo whatever product you're selling, if you can have them trust you like The Rock, you can sell whatever to whoever. It's all about trust and helping others solve problems. You just gotta break through that trust barrier because there's a lot of shady con people out there. \n\nGood luck on your $10 from 1,000 people journey or theoretic journey.",

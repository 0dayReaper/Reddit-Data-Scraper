    "postText": "So I launched my prototype a month ago, basically offering a service that pays tiktokers for using music from our library in their posts. Although we\u2019ve been seeing some traffic, we\u2019re struggling to have visitors actually go through the process of using one of the songs and fill out the form to get paid. \n\nI\u2019ve made some changes (price points, form submission) but still no luck. Do you guys have any idea what might be holding visitors back from using the service? Is it the reward being too low or the choices too few? \n\nWould love to hear any feedback or advice!\n\nWebsite: socialbounty.io/bounties",

Transform 'you'll be given a score based on your profile. Your score will determine the prize money for each bounty. The more people you reach with your profile, the higher your score will be, and the more money you'll make' to 'Connect your account and earn money for every view.'\n\nHowever, these are just optimizations. Perhaps your real issue lies elsewhere. For example, your target group might not know how to get your music into their videos because they use a specific app that already provides them with music. Talk to the people who signed up and ask them why they signed up in the first place.",

Definitely makes sense how it could be confusing for users, especially when that\u2019s not how the system currently works. Right now the instructions are in the \u201cbounties\u201d page and are definitely more straightforward for this prototype. I just removed all the info about the waitlist and beta for now and see if that changes anything.\n\nRegarding your second point. I\u2019m advertising on TikTok so I think users know how to use music but you\u2019re right maybe making a full tutorial available would be better. I\u2019ll work on that and put it on the page.",

Does it work smoothly? Maybe you can also reach out to some TikTokers personally and get their feedback. Good luck!",

The payment is after the fact and Manual. All they have to do is type in their Venmo and that\u2019s it so there shouldn\u2019t be too much friction. \n\nI agree I think reaching out direct 1 on 1 might be the next step!",

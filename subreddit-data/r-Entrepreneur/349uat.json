    "postText": "I found Justine Musk's comments to be spot on.\n\n\"Justine Musk, first wife of billionaire Elon Musk, knows a thing or two about wealth and hard work \u2014 her ex-husband is a founder of PayPal, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and has an estimated net worth of $12.1 billion. \n\nShe recently posted a response to a Quora thread asking the question \u201cWill I become a billionaire if I am determined to be one and put in all the necessary work required?\u201d\n\nHer answer is \u201cno,\u201d though she says that the Quora reader is asking the wrong question altogether. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re determined. So what? You haven\u2019t been racing naked through shark-infested waters yet,\u201d she writes. \u201cWill you be just as determined when you wash up on some deserted island, disoriented and bloody and ragged and beaten and staring into the horizon with no sign of rescue?\u201d\n\nShe then offers some advice: \n\n\u201cShift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs. Ask yourself what you have the potential to offer that is so unique and compelling and helpful that no computer could replace you, no one could outsource you, no one could steal your product and make it better and then club you into oblivion (not literally). Then develop that potential. Choose one thing and become a master of it.  Choose a second thing and become a master of that.  When you become a master of two worlds (say, engineering and business), you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea sex and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life.\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. (The world does not care what you want or deserve.)  The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life. There is no roadmap, no blueprint for this; a lot of people will give you a lot of advice, and most of it will be bad, and a lot of it will be good and sound but you\u2019ll have to figure out how it doesn\u2019t apply to you because you\u2019re coming from an unexpected angle. And you\u2019ll be doing it alone, until you develop the charisma and credibility to attract the talent you need to come with you.\nHave courage. (You will need it.)\n\nAnd good luck.  (You\u2019ll need that too.)\u201d\n\n",

                            "comment": "Yeah she literally described Musk in her post. Which works if you want to go into that industry but even then he was definitely no master of physics when it came to building Tesla and especially SpaceX. I mean a bachelor's in physics will you nowhere in terms of the knowledge required to build those ideas. I think he was a genius entrepreneur who was a very good businessman that surrounded himself with brilliant minds. At the end of the day, Musk would be successful because of his other quality traits that he's a positive thinker, innovative, hard working when it comes to passion and he's not afraid to fail (biggest nemesis to entrepreneurs because some have a lot more to lose than others). Being a billionaire entrepreneur has nothing to do with mastering your craft. You find masters in the craft that will do the work for you. Hence, Musk didn't design Tesla vehicles or the Rockets for each respective company. He had brilliant aerospace engineers and mechanical/electoral engineers that built his products. He never mastered a single thing in his life. That's what makes him so brilliant. He was successful the day he invested in himself and his abilities to do business and surround himself with brilliant people. He was definitely no Tesla or Edison that's for damm sure. And Musk is one of my favorite entrepreneurs in the world right now. In my opinion, the biggest business genius out there (surpassing that snake Zuckerberg). ",

And from my experience, I have also come to realize that I personally don't tend to share this obsessiveness.\n\nHere's an example of obsession:\n\nI used to think I was obsessive until I met someone who is truly obsessive. He thinks about food almost every hour of the day. His entire life revolves around food. He is friends with other food obsessed people. You might wander into his house and a Michelen star chef will be casually cooking in his kitchen. He knows restauranteurs and food critics on a first name basis. His earliest memories of childhood involve food. He would rather have his dick cut off than his tongue. He can't stand to eat \"bad\" food, because life is too short for \"bad\" food. As a result, he is sometimes impossibly annoying to eat with (especially if the food is, in his words, \"fucking terrible\") while other times I have the most incredible meals because he is there to show me the beauty of something I might otherwise never have understood. His obsession has provided him with a level of success that is very rare. He leads millionaires on food tours around the world. He has eaten at many of the most famous restaurants in the world, enjoyed the rarest beers and wines, and has an encyclopedic knowledge of pasta, seafood, cheese, sausages, breads and coffee. He is completely obsessed with food. (By the way, this guy's day job is professor at a top US college)\n\nWhen I met him, I realized I was not as obsessive as I thought I was. That's probably why I'm not as successful in my endeavors as he is in his. I have yet to decide if I am ok with that fact.",

            "comment": "I think Paul Graham wrote about it quite well: http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\n\n&gt; It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.\n\n&gt; There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side, Microsoft's future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.\n\n&gt; Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.\n\n&gt; If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.\n\n&gt; There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.\n\n&gt; The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it's more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it's more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.",

As the ex said: The world doesn't care how much you want the money, or how much you deserve it, or think you deserve it.\n\nSo, if you're all about the money, you stop providing the world with a reason to give it to you.\n\nAnyone play poker? As you play, it is not about the money, it is not about winning a dollar here, or losing one there. It is about playing the game, and playing it right. If you do that, the money will come to you.\n\nIf, instead, you chase the money, and make your play about the money, you'll go broke really hard and really quick.",

I regard financial independence as the ability to live debt free, so being able to own your own car and house if you want that.\n\nIn reality, financial independence is completely attainable with decent 9-5 job and doesn't require entrepreneurship.  This number also varies based on cost of living.  Someone in the suburban mid west U.S. could be living extremely well off $75k a year while someone in NYC might need more like $120k to lead a similar lifestyle.\n\nThen just work up from there. You don't need to be financially independent to start a business, but it certainly makes it easier.  It isn't that far a leap to a million dollars if you are grinding away and have an in-demand profitable business.\n\nFrom there, using investments and business expansion it isn't that far a leap to an 8 figure net worth.\n\nAfter that number is when I think it gets more difficult to generate wealth and I'm not saying its a quick easy step from 15 million dollars to 100+ million dollars or that it is a quick easy step from 300 million dollars to 1 billion dollars.\n\nHowever, for most people it isn't even necessary to get to those final 2 places.  You can live an extremely fulfilling and even relatively extravagant lifestyle off of just 1 million dollars most places in the U.S, let alone 10 million.",

I didn't mention it because my post wasn't supposed to be about me specifically, but I absolutely know that it is true we are always striving for more and better.  I know a decent amount of millionaires and you're right they all want more money.\n\nYou're also right in assuming I am not a millionaire.  However, I believe I will be a millionaire in the next two years, and I know I will absolutely not be satisfied with just a million dollars.  Personally, my financial goals are to die with a net worth of over 100 million dollars.  Assuming I live to old age.  So I am not advocating a frugal lifestyle or low financial ambition.\n\nMy point was more aimed at the fact that you need to start low and build up.  The majority of billionaires spent decades getting there.  Someone who is asking about getting a billion dollars before they have even earned $1 million or even $100k has the absolute wrong attitude (IMO) about wealth generation.  Why the hell are they talking about a billion when they haven't even earned a fraction of that?\n\nFurthermore, if someone thinks a billion is the end all answer, they don't really understand the value of a dollar.  You can make immense strides in business, your life, and your community with just fraction of that.\n\nSure, most people will always strive for more, myself included, but you can't be thinking of a billion as the end game when you haven't even begun to climb the ladder towards it.  It took Warren Buffet 50 years to earn a billion dollars.",

What made him lucky was that he got bought out in '99 RIGHT before the bubble burst.\n\nSo he was sitting on a mountain of cash for what fantastic idea?  Zip2, a city-search app for media?  Yeah, that's nice and all, but it didn't change the world.  It wasn't super-brilliant.  It was a solid, boring product.\n\nThen, once he had a big old mountain of cash and business experience he was in a prime position to grow.\n\nSo how do you become a billionaire?  Benefit from a financial bubble and be lucky enough to have the means and opportunity to cash out at it's peak.\n\nThen, from a position of lifetime guaranteed financial security, you go and invest in ideas that look good.",

Here's the short quote, with the full context below:\n\n&gt; Luck is happening all around us every day. ... The skill is recognizing when it's happening and seizing the moment.\n\nAnd here's more context for the quote. You can read the full transcript at http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/09/nathan_blecharc.html.\n\n&gt; **Host:** I've been thinking a lot lately about luck versus skill and how much of our outcomes are based on our efforts and how much are just random. So here's a case where--whoever pulled that box of cereal out, I don't know if that was your plan originally--that was pretty fortuitous, right? There's a decent chance if you hadn't done that--certainly if you hadn't made the cereal, we wouldn't have Airbnb. Do you ever think about that? And do you think about how much of where we are sitting right now, in a nice set of incredibly airy and beautiful offices here in San Francisco, whether there, for the grace of God, or bad luck, you might be back doing something else? \n\n&gt; **Guest:** Well, there's certainly lots of opportunities such that had they turned out otherwise, we wouldn't be here today. So, super appreciative of all those things that went right along the way. What I'll say about the kind of question around, kind of, luck versus skill-- \n\n&gt; **Host:** Effort.\n\n&gt; **Guest:** Yeah--is that, I think luck is happening all around us every day. And the skill is recognizing when it's happening and seizing the moment.",

He wants to breathe in her neck slowly, whisper things in her ear, and kiss her slowly.** \n\nThe song is in Spanish and has a catchy beat that makes you want to dance. The lyrics are about taking things slow and enjoying the moment. The song has become a worldwide hit and has been remixed with other popular artists.\r  \n\r  \nAm loving this answer \ud83d\ude05\n\nVideo Proof:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ranaphoolmk/status/1667144879334649856?s=20\n\nAI Tool (Chatdox.com)",

            "comment": "right off the bat this product was pretty neat. Tested it with a waltonchain white paper &amp; a casey neistat video (under 5min per limit on free version). I'll publish both tests in a diff longer post. \n\nIt understood both but I was somewhat disappointed when I asked it \"what do you think about the structure of the foundation?\" in regards to the white paper. It just told me what it is vs what it thinks. Idk if it has that capacity but that's what i was expecting it to be able to answer that question differently. \n\nThe whitepaper was 39pgs in total and it did read it hella fast. I also asked it about the ecosystem (mentioned in pg 26) and it got the answer super fast. I image that for lawyers this is a superb product or even for business men that see business plans on a daily. There are numerous LoBs where this product can get a long manual task done in seconds.",

We are trying to improve the answers and one thing we suggest is using gpt-4. The answers are more than what you can expect. \n\nWe are going to work on structural answers and keeping our answers better.",

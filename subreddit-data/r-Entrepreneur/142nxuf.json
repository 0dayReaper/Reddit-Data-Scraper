Work out how you're going to gather prospects to go in the top of your funnel\n\n7    Make your first sales calls\n\n8.   Sort out your payment taking and billing processes, and do a bit more graphic design ( you know it makes sense ) to make your invoices look nice and design a few adverts \n\n9    Get all them social media accounts set up\n\n10   make another couple of sales calls\n\n\\--- have lunch\n\n11   organise your working space and get really comfortable\n\n12   get your diary out and plan your marketing activity to feed step 6\n\n13   work on your price lists and offerings\n\n14.  start whacking out the social medias, press release to relevant media\n\n15   Make some more sales calls\n\n\\--- it's wine o'clock\n\n16 Next day - repeat from about step 11\n\nI've just typed this out as fast as I can type so please people, add more things and let me know what I've missed.  \n\n\nGood Luck!",

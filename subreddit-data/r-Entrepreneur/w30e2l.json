    "postText": "My daughter has been begging me to help her set up a lemonade stand as she saw some older kids across the street try one for a few days.   She is very insistent on pushing me to help her.\n\nAs hot as it has been in my state I felt like it was a perfect time to try an idea I've had in the back of my head.  Lets take a really simple concept and add a slightly different twist to it. \n\nA frozen drink / Lemonade stand because its hot.  Also who doesn't like frozen drinks?\n\n I have access to many frozen drink machines so I brought one home and put it on a cart with wheels.  I literally put this machines, a folding table and a beach tent over her for shade.\n\n**The Supply Chain**\n\nI found a supplier that will sell me 40 flavors of drink mix for 1 penny per fluid ounce when reconstituted with water.  I work in logistics so I was able to get the price down to the bare minimum.  I'm going to take this as serious as my own business.  We are going to fight tooth and nail to get this down to a science.\n\n(Contracted with a co-packer and their inhouse formulas, Bought enough to fill out a pallet, shipped to a warehouse with a dock to avoid a liftgate fee and loaded my van to store in my garage.)\n\nCosts were this - $23 per case of concentrate x 60 cases for a pallet.  $150 for shipping.  =$1,530 in concentrate costs.  Selling a cup at $2 per cup we have $19,000 worth of product at that price point.\n\nMachine was free but you can get a good used one for 1,200-1,500 per machine.\n\nCups were 14.49 for a 250 pack of red cups.  $43.47 total for 3 bags.\n\n**Marketing**\n\n3 hand drawn signs that were taped on to some abandoned yard signs from a roofing company.  My daughter colored a bright and aesthetically pleasing sign advertising frozen drinks just down the block from a very busy street in a major city.  There was no way to get lost.\n\n**Breakdown of Sales**\n\nPricing was $2 per cup.   She had lemonade and non-alcoholic margarita for flavors to start.\n\nCup size was 16 oz so people felt like they were getting a good deal.\n\n**The Chaos**\n\nFrom Friday-Sunday she sold 512 cups of frozen drinks sitting in my driveway. For a total of **$1024** in revenue.\n\nWord spread quick and she had a line most of the weekend.  Once the parents figured out they could add their own alcohol to the mix she was flooded with parents and their kids.  We saw many repeat customers.\n\nThe heat drove people in and we had issues with keeping the machine full and product frozen as it struggled to keep up with demand.  I ended up making batches and putting them in my freezer to get them cold before refilling the machine.\n\n**The joy.**\n\nWatching my daughter count out over 1k in cash was amazing.  She was begging me to quit summer camp so she can work the stand everyday.  I am so proud of her and watching her confidence grow.  She was already asking me if I could get her a second machine but I told her to see how next weekend goes.\n\nI am going to limit her to running this only on the weekends.  I don't want to burn her out and as I have learned you need to have balance.  I've been an Entrepreneur for 11 years now.  I wanted to share my thought process and show how easy it is to get in the game even as an 8 year old girl.  It also gave me a much needed dopamine spike to find passion in building something from nothing. The trick is being smart and seasoned enough to avoid the pain and stress of bad decisions and a poorly developed model.  I am very good at buying and getting my prices down to the bare minimum.  We started with a 91.7% profit margin on our drinks.  So she is keeping most of what she sells.\n\nIf my daughter can do it so can you.  Plus it was really fun spinning a simple concept into a \"serious venture\"  Daughter is now the richest 8 yr old on the block.",

Teacher knew I did it by myself, made a comment to my mom and still failed me on the project. \n\nSo it's not that I approve the dad going above and beyond what was required but it shows his commitment to helping his kids.",

She's already got enough anxiety that she wants to quit SUMMER CAMP to SELL BOOZE SLUSHIES so dad will be happy with her. Having friends isn't as important as having *more money and things* than her friends does. I feel so bad for this child.",

It sounds like the answer is that as long as more than half of their financial support comes from the parents then they can be claimed as a dependent.

Don't you need licences and stuff to sell drinks on the street? Are you collecting sales taxes, registering as a business and so on? Let alone effectively employing a child? No one would buy the whole \"it was her idea thing\", any more than they would if you sent her down a coal mine \"because she asked to\".\n\nMost lemonade stands probably make, like, $10 a day or something. This is a business with a projected revenue of $365k a year - even if you run it at weekends, it's over $100k a year. That's stepping some way outside the bounds of a fun thing to do with your kid that will get overlooked by whoever regulates this stuff in your jurisdiction. \n\nI get that this intended to be a heartwarming story but you're framing this as something that anyone could do. I'm sure anyone who can swing some sweet child labour, run an off-the-books cash business using assets borrowed from someone else, not pay any tax and not worry about complying with the law could indeed make a tidy profit. \n\nHave you considered having your daughter set up a few dog fights and run a book on the side?",

Where I am everyone needs a food handling course to sell.\n\n2) Are your residential neighbours happy to have the increased commercial traffic and parking on their street from this?\n\n3) Does your local government regulate home businesses, requiring licensing and potentially inspections for food safety?\n\n4) Does your area not have sales taxes for business operations?\n\n5) Running a food business on this scale how are you managing liability if some faker claims injury and their lawyer finds you have no license, pay no sales tax, have no inspections and are \u00ab employing \u00bb an 11 year old to work it?\n\n\nSounds like 95% of the groundwork and general operations is you and she provided the service/labor.  Not sure you can really call this her business.  More of a franchise level where her ownership comes from sweat equity.  This could be a good model if you get property licensed and target portable operations in popular areas (outside big box hardware stores, etc).",

The trick is being smart and seasoned enough to avoid the pain and stress of bad decisions and a poorly developed model. I am very good at buying and getting my prices down to the bare minimum.\n\n**Things my daughter did:**\n\n* Begged me to help her.\n\n* Colored the signs.\n\n* Served the drinks to customers in exchange for cash.\n\n* Counted cash.",

When the school came the second time we quoted a law stating you can sell goods on your own property.  \n\nWhen I think about it now I know the law wasn\u2019t the thing that caused them to back off but it still remains as a good memory when we were young naive entrepreneurs :)",

Here is my own comparable story, that I posted elsewhere in this thread, with a very different ending.  My 11yo daughter goes to a craft camp and, on her own, makes a big pillow that looks like a hamburger.  (Meat, lettuce, cheese, tomato, etc all on a bun.)  All of her friends and their parents love it, she buys some more fabric, makes and sells a bunch more, makes some money.  Proven concept, profitable business, etc ---  which we then completely abandoned.\n\nWhy?  Because in order to grow it, her mother and I would have had to jump in, and do a bunch of things that an 11yo old isn't capable of and has no interest in, like line up suppliers, find some distribution channels, set up payment processing, etc, and at that point it's not a kid's business it's her marketing exec mom and MBA dad's business.  Also she's a kid and what's fun for six weeks isn't going to be fun for years - we could already see she was getting bored of doing the same thing over and over.\n\nAnd also our general policy is that we just buy her art and craft supplies and let her do whatever she wants and that's always paid off in creative ideas and new skills (which is how she developed the hamburger pillow idea).  She's the kind of kid that will find an old lamp that is sitting in the corner and ask to paint it.  Telling her that we need four pillows by friday would be a completely different dynamic.  She does still do some occasional work for me (product photography for my side business), but 95% of her time is focused on school, friends, and her own creative ideas, which is IMO how it should be at that age.",

While you have done everything necessary to get this operation off the ground and are experiencing success, I think it is as equally important to teach her the importance of following the law!\n\nJust because she is 8 yrs. old does not insulate her (or you) from legal ramifications.  You could potentially face a cease and desist order, fines, lawsuits, punitive damages, tax fraud and more!\n\nEx.- If I own a car wash and a kid down the street is washing cars for ten bucks, that kid IS my competition.  That kid is taking business away from mine.  \n\nIn your case, you are the competition to every 7-11, Dairy Queen, Smoothie Shop, etc. who sells frozen drinks in your area.  They have deep pockets and I assure you they will put an end to it quickly.  Sadly, once it becomes an issue, authorities will not be able to just brush it off as a kid w/ a lemonade stand.\n\nThere is an old movie, based on a true story, worth watching that pertains to this exact same thing.  The kid lived on a farm and started selling manure.  He ultimately made thousands upon thousands of dollars!  Then, Uncle Sam showed up!\n\nIf this is something you and she really want to pursue, buy a food truck, get a vendor license, register it with the city, set up an llc and pay taxes.  You can never go wrong by doing the right thing.  Not to mention, you will truly teach her entrepreneurship and everything that comes with it.  Otherwise, you both may learn an invaluable yet costly lesson!\n\nBest wishes!",

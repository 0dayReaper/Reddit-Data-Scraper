Dad life really blows sometimes. \n\"If not me, then who\"- Travis Manion USMC.\nI found a great partner to be my wife and raise my twins. She's got that part on lock. It's on me to provide no matter what. I spent my 20s in prison because I was an asshole kid. Came home at 30 and started over with nothing and no one. Got a job at outback. Ended up making $12.50 an hour. I loved it cus I love cooking. It's my shit. But she got pregnant with twins and u can't raise a family on $12.50 hr. So I got my CDL. Every day is a fuckin grind. Some days it really blows. But I went from making $12.50 an hour, to now I refuse to move my truck for less than 3 bucks a mile, which is roughly $180 hr. Consistent grind man. That's Literally the only answer. It fuckin sucks. I recommend hitting the lottery. Cus NOBODY should have to work this hard to survive. But I ain't got lottery luck. So, grind it is\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Is it impossible to find 2-6 hours per day or more when I need to to grind at my side projects? No.\n\nIt comes down to dicsipline (which I am terrible at) and desire (which I have  a TON of), and consistently putting in the reps until you've strung enough small wins into a medium sized one, and enough of those into a large one.\n\nIt takes more time because you have less of it, but it is certainly not impossible to continue working at your side-project at 34.",

It's a small thing, but shows lack of detail/perfection to me or appreciation of the audience.  I have guided budget holders on \u00a32million+ IT spend, so have some experience here. You can get some great books on English grammar and spelling which hit the main \"gotchas\" - I had to do this too.\n\nPractice a energetic, but clear 2 minute summary - and ask everyone you meet what they do and do they know anyone in xyz industry that you can have a 5 minute chat with.\n\nHave a demo system/sand box area for new/prospective clients.\n\nIf it's an API write good docs and example calls from the main languages.\n\nWork out what is unique in your solution and write it down. \nTry and figure out what the hygiene functionality you need.\nDifferent people are involved in the buying process.  End users, managers/budget holders and IT technical/Security team gatekeepers - somewhere in your introductory spiel you need to focus on their concerns. Consider implementation and support effort in depth, provide example presentations. - provide simple tools/plans that they can help sell it to other internal stakeholders. THIS IS ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. Offer to present alongside if time permits.\n\nYou need to enthuse these key stakeholders - learn to sell yourself and your product - they are going to give you their money, give them a reason to know it is well spent.\n\nHave answers for all possible criticisms and be open to adapt (if a common request, perhaps set up a system of partial funding between groups of prospects and give 6 months exclusive use of the function if outside your roadmap).\n\nPerhaps find older software that did what you do better and approach people in forums that are showing dissatisfaction and offer 20% cost off for advice on product improvement and public endorsement.\n\nRecommendation is key for you as you won't probably be able to pay for leads/big marketing budget.\n\nBE METHODICAL about who you approach and where they are in the \"Sales Process\". BIG ONE.\n\nKey for you, I think, is learning to sell yourself and an idea.\nGet yourself to Amazon and search \"sales influencing techniques\", \"gaining trust\" \"influencing skills\" \"how to win friends and influence people\" (get only this if you can't afford anything else), buy a secondhand copy of the highest rated books. Read them all cover to cover. DON'T CHEAT, IT PAYS BACK 10X IN LONG RUN.\n\nI don't know about selling to young people, but in general it is the same: Do they trust me? Does it satisfy a need of theirs? Can they pay for it? Can I deliver?\n\nThis is well meaning. I appreciate I have rambled a bit!\n\nGood luck.",

This gave me almost all of Fri to get some work done. If they value you, a job should rather accomodate this rather than try to find someone to replace you.\n* Then I went freelance / consultant 3 days a week, worked on my own thing 2 days\n* Then did 2 freelance / 3 my own\n* Then took the leap\n\nThis allowed me to keep some income coming in, keep paying the mortgage, while having some actual time to move things forward",

Hearing all these growing up I really didnt want to have the same story. I'm 26 now, worked 3 years in a full time job, set aside cash for my investments (mainly to start a business, invest in stock market and gold). Then by the 3rd year I got a mentor, started working on my business. But knew I couldnt start it unless I quit my job since it was definitely taking a toll on me and it was not a typical 9-5 job. We had to even work late night since it was logistics. So I decided I would regret it if I couldnt start my business now. The day before I decided to quit my job I saw a post on instagram with a person lying in the coffin and all his avatars who reflected the dreams and person he couldnt become looking down on his dead body. And I thought I really didnt want that to happen to me, if I died tomorrow I didnt want to die with a regret.\n\nSo I quit my full time job, but note I dont have a lot of liabilities which helped me make this decision. Coz if everything fails tomorrow I just need to get back up and find a job. So with this in mind started my business. I really want to know what its like to build up a successful business and also how to sell a business as well. Just trying to climb the ladder slowly hoping to learn alot on the way.",

    "postText": "Had a cousin who\u2019s friend won some sort of business venture contest. Won some money, somehow got an investor on board there after and now they\u2019re doing great.\n\nI have 2 possible options to talk about someone investing in my newly launched online website. However I\u2019d prefer to keep it out of the family in a sense that I just don\u2019t want to mix things up like that in the beginning.\n\nSo, as far as crowdfunding or other sources in which I can pitch my online website, what avenues would you suggest. For crowdfunding there\u2019s kickstarter, gofundme, and others. Aside from that I\u2019m not sure where else to look.",

    "postText": "TLDR:\u00a0I was offered the CTO position by an old acquaintance. Now we are going to negotiate about how many shares they are willing to give me.\n\nI was offered the CTO position by an old acquaintance. They offered me the same position almost a year ago, however I declined and back then I wanted to focus on my Uni and my own software company. I got to say now that I am finished with Uni I am quite open to the idea of closing my company (1 person company) and joining them.\n\nThe idea of the acquaintance and his colleague is to rent out appartments for businesses, so B2B market. Since last time they asked me to join them, they won first position in a startup program organized by the government. They won a 150K \u20ac grant including free coaching and good contacts that bring potential investors. Their goal is to raise 1M - 2M. They showed me their document that shows the value of their company which is 2.5M (they calculated that based on competition and their prognosis). They have a portfolio of 10K appartments that they could rent out. They are not owning the appartments, it's from other renting out companies. They have an MVP that is not quite finished, however looks good so far. They don't have any revenue as their booking site is not yet online. After I declined back then, they found another CTO that is living almost 400km away, this CTO was not really motivated and did not have the know-how as I have it, now they are going to pay out a part of his shares. They plan to have an exit of 200M.\n\nOnce the money of the startup program arrived they will pay out a salary for them and for me. The money should arrive in less than 6 months. In addition to the minimum salary (we would all start with the same salary and go up together) they are willing to give me shares of the company for free. I am also open to invest some money too, in order to get more shares. The shares are the following:\n\nPerson 1:\u00a040%\n\nPerson 2:\u00a025%\n\nOld CTO, which I will replace: 25%\n\nReserved for investors:\u00a010%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are three questions I have:\n\nDoes their evaluation of the company looks plausible? Or is 2.5M a bit too high?\n\nConsidering my position, how many shares can I ask. What seems plausible and fair?\n\nIs there anything I should especially pay attention to during the negotiations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that I don't want to rip them off,  I want to be fair, the same way I expect them to be fair to me, that is why I ask those questions here. Thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\u00a0they don't own the appartments themselves, They only have the permission to rent those appartments out.",

            "comment": "I would hope Old outgoing CTO isn't taking 25% with them? If this org doesn't have basic vesting setup there will be issues down the road. You are coming in late to the game, post-anymoney, but pre-launch.   \n\\- 10% reserved for investors plan is almost laughable (their first company I assume?) Convert that to option pool and increase to 15% (20+% if you want top talent).  \n\\- Exiting CTO was there how long? if &lt; a year should get 0, if &lt; 4 years should be only a percentage of their package. Vesting should generally be 4 years with a 1 year cliff. IT'S NOT TO LATE TO FIX THINGS DO IT BEFORE MONEY HITS BANK ACCOUNT  \n\\- 2.5m is entirely reasonable for an idea on paper, depending on market/team/idea of course.  \n\n\nYou should think of yourself somewhere in-between \"founder-lite\" and \"first hire\". Asking for 5% wouldn't be unreasonable here.",

Isn't there still a risk involved even post-anymoney?  \nAnd I am not 100% sure about the technical state, maybe there is still a lot of work to be done? Would that be an argument?",

Employees (including founder-lite) usually come from the option pool.",

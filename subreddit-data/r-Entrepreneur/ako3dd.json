    "postText": "It was about 8 weeks before graduation weekend in my college town in 2012. I was a senior about to graduate. My mother was bugging me to help her find a hotel near campus for graduation weekend. For her, my father, my grandparents and my sister. Three rooms.\n\nI called about 10 hotels around campus. Checked Priceline. There was nothing available at all. AirBNB was the same.\n\nThe closest city with availability was about 30 minutes away. They only had 3 rooms left in the entire hotel and they were $350 per night plus fees, each, with a three night minimum. Even they were cashing in on graduation. Thats $3,150 + fees. I refused. I\u2019d rather them stay home and miss graduation.\n\nThe closest hotels with normal pricing and availability were over an hour away.\n\nI thought about my friends who were sophomores and juniors renting apartments in the area. Classes ended about 10 days before graduation. They all were gone for the summer working internships or back home. Their apartments were empty. I texted a group of three friends living in a three bedroom apartment. I offered them $500 if they let my parents stay there over the weekend. They quickly agreed. All set with my family and we saved about $3,200.\n\nMy college had recently added a feature to the email (Google powered email). If you started typing someone\u2019s name it would autofill and provide you with their email address.\n\nMy school had about 4,000 students in each class and the facebook group had about 3,000 each. I joined each group.\n\nI then went through using one screen on the facebook group members page and one screen on the gmail page typing in names and mining email addresses. About 20 hours later I had a list with the email addresses of 3000 juniors and 3000 seniors.\n\nI typed out a nice email to the Juniors:\n\n&gt;Friends,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My family and a few of my classmates\u2019 families  are looking for a place to stay on graduation weekend. If you will be gone that weekend and would be interested in renting out your apartment to them let me know.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks!\n\nI then typed out this email to my fellow seniors:\n\n&gt;Friends,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A few of my undergraduate classmates are offering to rent their rooms to the families of seniors during graduation weekend. If your family needs a place to stay right near campus during that weekend let me know!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks!\n\nI sent both emails and then headed out to track practice.\n\nWhen I got home 4 hours later I had over 400 emails in my inbox.\n\nI ended up tiering the pricing based on location, cleanliness, ability to provide linens and amount of rooms. I paid out about $35 per room per night on average and I did a three night minimum for everyone. Graduation weekend is quite an ordeal so that was pretty standard anyway.\n\nI rented the rooms at about $100 per room per night. This was a big savings over hotels but the guests had to be okay with a dirty apartment and bringing their own linens for the most part. But they got to stay in the heart of the action and save a lot of money.\n\nI set low expectations for the renters. I told them it would be dirty. I told them it would be sweaty. I told them to bring linens and cleaning supplies if they wanted to.\n\nI strictly told all of the underclassmen to clean their apartments very well. I sent them detailed checklists. I did the best I could to make sure it would be presentable.\n\nAs soon as I collected payment from the senior I would pay the underclassman and connect them on email telling them to organize the key hiding and check out stuff. I kept a few apartments extra in case of emergency and ended up using one of them so I'm glad I did that.\n\nOverall I brokered about 60 rooms and cleared about $10,000.\n\nEDIT: A few people have asked what I'm up to since this time. Here is [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ac8rqr/my_founding_story/) I posted here a few weeks ago.

It almost reminds me of youtube in the earlier days when people got up in arms whenever someone was trying to make money off their videos in any way, being called sell outs and heavily criticized. \n\nI totally get that no one likes a pure advertisement where nothing is given in return. However, posts with a lot to offer that are legit helpful that then go on to link back to their website or service in some way should be welcomed and met with less disdain imo. Anyway, that's one of the cornerstones of business: offer something helpful for free and hope that it leads to business. As long as it isn't one of those scummy posts where they only give you half information to peak your interest and lead into \"buy now to learn the rest\", I see no harm.\n\nAnd anyway, you can't expect to get truly helpful advice without at least some advertisement. Few people will write something that might harm their business if they aren't getting at least a little something in return.",

When my sister graduated from there in 2014, some of the family did indeed stay in dorms rented out by the university. \n\nAlso, if you read the OP a little closer, you'll notice that he didn't do this for campus-owned apartments or dorms. It was strictly privately owned houses and apartments in town that he worked with. Even if this is against the lease, most landlords will probably look the other way. At worst, they can try to dock some money from the security deposits, but unless there's damage, they'll probably fail at that. ",

He doesn't have the money, oh and he can't drive for Lyft until he gets it fixed because Lyft tagged his car as damaged and not part of their fleet until repaired. So now he's stuck with a broken car he can't afford to fix and can't make money how he normally does because the broken car doesn't allow him to do it. The phrase \"Better safe than sorry\" is more appropriate here. ",

            "comment": "Your story reminded me of a similar case where someone did an arbitrage play like this.\n\nThe guy opened up the phone book (does anyone still know what that is?) and called up all the dentists in his area.\n\nHe asked, \"Are you interested in buying a dental practice or selling your dental practice?\"\n\nThen he made two lists:\n\n* Dentists who wanted to buy.\n\n* Dentists who wanted to sell.\n\nAfter he finished the calls, he matched the buyers with the sellers and collected a nice commission as a middleman.\n\nMade me wonder if you could do that with accountants, lawyers, all kinds of businesses. Some business owner is ready to sell and get out, or ready to buy and expand their client base.\n\nI imagine the price points are bigger, in the six figures or even seven figures. Even a 10 percent commission on a $100,000 sale could be a tidy profit.",

The house is rented for a couple weeks because the worlds largest gem show is here in Tucson this month. \n\nOur guests are vendors from Brazil selling mineral specimens. We are making $3600 and they are only here to sleep which means we have the house to ourselves all day long. We have done this for the last six years and had some great guests. The first guy retired, the second cut back on staff, the third bought a house here just for the show. Otherwise they all were interested in doing this over the following year.  \n\nOne unexpected bonus is we have incentive to declutter, reorganize, and deep clean the house every year. Each year gets easier aa we seem to get rid of more crap as time goes on. So basically we have made $21,600 for sleeping in a different room.   ",

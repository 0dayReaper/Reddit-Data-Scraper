    "postText": "Here are some of the key ones I keep at the front of my mind:\n\n1. Don't prematurely optimize. Aim to validate business ideas as quickly, cheaply and effectively as possible.\n2. Even if there's real risk of failure, treat the money you spend on your entrepreneurial ventures as *business investments*. Be strategic about how much you'll spend, on what timetables, and just treat it as an investment that may or may not pay off. (Helps to snap you out of extreme risk aversion and the reluctance to spend any significant amount of money, especially after you've been traumatized by past costly failures.) Some choose to invest in stocks or IRAs. You're choosing to invest in a business that may or may not have the potential to explode your income IF things work out the right way.\n3. Aim to maximize leverage at every single step of the process. There's a Patrick Bet David quote that just echoes in my mind every time I think about this: \"Millionaires master leverage.\" Whether through automation or delegation, increasing your leverage is CRITICAL for allowing you to get way more results per unit time spent. Standardize your processes as much as possible, break down every step of the system and ask how you could massively increase the amount of leverage you have at each step, and just keep pushing it until it's absolutely maxxed the fuck out. This is absolutely vital because you can't get rich doing tasks that you could spend $5 - $10/hr to delegate. Find ways to free up more of your time so you can spend it on higher-value, higher-payoff tasks.\n4. Use outrageous thought exercises to massively stretch your thinking. Say your output at a certain business step is 300 units per week. Ask yourself, if there was a gun to your head, how would you get to 10,000 outputs, or 100,000 outputs per week? Sounds impossible? Tough shit, there's a gun to to your head -- so if you HAD to figure it out, how WOULD you do it? This has been MASSIVE for helping me to, quite literally, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000x my efficiency at certain previously time-consuming steps of the workflow. These thinking exercises force you to do more than just mechanically use your body to perform repetitive menial tasks; they instead force you to use your *mind* to find solutions and breakthroughs that you otherwise wouldn't have hit upon.\n5. Model the experts and what's been proven to already be working well. Don't waste time reinventing the wheel when others have spent tons of time and money to already figure a bunch of this shit out for you -- if only you'll just study them, listen to them and model them.\n\nWhat are some of your breakthrough thoughts that you keep at the forefront of your mind that help you operate sharply and effectively as an entrepreneur?",

Although my business wasn't entirely scalable (some hand made, custom designs were involved) I did try to apply it to as many areas as I could. \n\n1. Find reoccurring tasks/events in my work\n2. Build a system that would allow me to easily do this task, times 100.\n\nSaved me so much time AND got me more customers.",

I have helped lots of businesses to automate and simplify tasks just by using VBA in Excel/Word/Outlook and Access.\n\nAnother thing to do is to consider using low cost digital assistants to do repetitive work. You will find some really good ones on Upwork if you put in the effort to filter out the bad ones.\n\nThe book The 4 Hour Work Week is worth a read to put you in the right mindset. Don't expect to come away from it working just 4 hours a week, because you wont, however it will change the way you think about things. Like how to value your time vs finding someone on Upwork, or when to look for automation solutions.",

            "comment": "Another one from - beware of the gurus.\n\nThis should have been my first one. I have been self-employed for 20-odd years and in that time I have listened to gurus from all around the world, watched endless videos and read countless books. I have even got to personally know a few gurus doing the circuits.\n\nThe number I trust or listen to I can count on one hand.\n\nSome danger signs to look for\n\n1. If you find their advice is unsuitable for your business or is not applicable, they will try to convince you, it is just you not doing it right. This put me through the mental wringer a few times.\n2. They run down anyone competing with their ideas/services and they dismiss out of hand any of their competitors plus points.\n3. 25% of their content (books, videos, Tiktoks, or whatever) is spent telling you how wonderful they are and why you should listen to them. I have read books where over half of the book was about them and their past.\n4. They have a record of completely reinventing themselves. I have seen several gurus do this to distance themselves from the fact that they went bankrupt and had to start again.\n\nGurus will have you constantly comparing yourself to others and will have you doubting yourself. This will make you want to listen to them more in the hope that they will cure your self-doubt and negative thoughts. It ends up being a constant cycle.",

            "comment": "(1) Being able to fail fast and with confidence.\n\nIf something is not working either fix it or fail it, don't keep repeating it in the hope that it will get better on its own. This also applies to clients - if fix the situation or bin them, don't let the issues fester. This will free you up to find and work for more productive clients and will improve your mental health.\n\n(2) Sweat equity is no longer as important as it was.\n\nLike many of us on here, I used to spend hundreds of hours trying to DIY everything (accounts, marketing, websites, admin). The sweat equity was an investment in my business. Now with sites like Upwork you really have to weigh up is it worth spending 2 days learning to do something and then doing it (maybe badly), or just paying someone in Upwork \u00a350 to do it?\n\n(3) Automate where possible.\n\nThere is a lot you can do to automate aspects of your business without spending a fortune. Services lift IFTTT can take tasks away from you so you can spend more time on your business. If you have a programming mindset you can automate complex(ish) tasks with VBA in Excel/Word/Outlook/Access.\n\nIn short, time is your most important asset, it should be spent on improving your business not running it.",

    "postText": "I was born an entrepreneur, I always had a knack for business since 4th grade when I was selling toys at school so successfully that the administration of the school had to ban me till highschool when I would supply gaming cafes with video games at a cheaper price. I always found the edge because naturally I was edgy.\nWhat it takes to be an entrepreneur is to be the living definition of a businessman, you have to be harshly honest and most definetly you have to be rude.\nYou can't consider people's feelings because in reality this game has rules and the number one rule is to abandon all feelings.\nYou have to be hard like a rock and sharp like a lion.\nYou can't slack off because to get started you have to be quicker faster and better than the competition.\nYou have to be outgoing and always be up for the next big thing.\nYou have to have unwavering faith and confidence in yourself and In what you sell.\nYou have to have high communicative skills to translate your ideas into reality.\nYou have to be adaptable for the tides and times changes and you need to adjust and balance appropriately or else you will fall.\nYou have to be persistent for sometimes all you need is a little touch till you land that big pot.\nYou have to be bold for your products need to be sold.\nYou have to always be in a rush for money is time and you can't get that back no matter how hard you brush.\nYou have to plan ahead and execute with your mind and that begins as you lay in your bed.\nYou have to. You have to. You have to.\nMost important of all is you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to ,you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to,you have to.\nIn case you didn't get the message it's simple you have to take action, it's you and only you for an entrepreneur creates opportunities takes opportunities fails and ultimately is the biggest winner but it begins with you acting when there is no call for action whether it's the bright idea that you got or some supply on demand that you found, no one is going to push you. It's you having to do\nAnd that's what it takes when you wake up in the morning you should be on the run and when you go to bed it's not going to be fun.\nUltimately it's a difficult path but it rewards those who take it, with difficulty and pain comes ease.\nIf you are unsure of your success. Good because that's what the whole path is about, uncertainty is th entrepreneurship Moto and the greatest part is no matter what happens it's the risk that is always worth taking.",

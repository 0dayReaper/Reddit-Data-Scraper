Personally, I think it is great because money is everywhere. There is also huge number of young millionaires rising because they understand internet so much better and can capitalize on that. Or am I miscalculating it and in my own bubble a bit?",

I used to game socially as a release but product design, pitch decks, websites, networking on top of raising 4 children has eaten my free time and placed me in a sleep deficit I work my day job for 9-12 hours then hometime is about 3-4 hours with the fam then it\u2019s time for a solid 4 hours working the startup functions. I give more on the weekends shooting for about 10 hours solid on it. It sounds like a suicide mission but hey ya gotta do what ya gotta do! Don\u2019t say you don\u2019t have time because you have to MAKE time. Even if it means losing sleep, comfort, and an easy going pace of life. Because you can stay there in comfort on that cliff or you can jump and get beaten to shit until you learn to fly.",

They most certainly do. \n\nWhat the average person is capable of doing is unbelievable, but sometimes people don\u2019t know where to begin, and can be demoralized. \n\nHumans are the most adaptable species around and they start messing around and experimenting when life isn\u2019t working at a very basic level. \n\nRight now, things aren\u2019t working and people are tinkering. Honest work isn\u2019t getting them far so they are adapting. \n\nIf I\u2019m getting a signal from all of this wantrepreneur noise, it\u2019s just that.\n\nPeople will do what needs to be done at the end of the day, and some of the best innovations will come from these people when we least expecting.",

Gary vee and hustle culture pushed entrepreneurship on everyone. Mix that with tech and the digital age and everyone things they can be an entrepreneur or wants to be one. No one talks about the dark days that can come from it. And not oh I had some tough times and ate shot, but like severe depression and anxiety. It\u2019s lonely and you sometimes have no one to turn to. I can\u2019t wait till the fad is over.",

    "postText": "For reference I'm a 23(M) who has been trying to create content on YouTube over the past 2 years in hopes of creating a side income. I do love what I do but it is extremely time consuming to edit videos to a higher quality while working a full time job and seeing very little progress. With 200 videos posted and just over 300 subscribers while obtaining editing software, camera,  lighting equipment, and time spent it has become overall a very costly venture\n\nI feel like the general consensus in business is to never give up but at some point I feel like I need to analyze if it's worth it to continue seriously or just switch it to a hobby. Also if I did have more free time,  I would spend it trying to build something else that could be more profitable long term.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on knowing when to change directions or any relevant stories related to your business?",

Maybe you should lower the amount of videos your making so it\u2019s not draining on your free time and if one of your videos does takeoff. It\u2019ll be like a hobby blowing up more than your side hustle finally paying off.",

I've thought about abandoning the channel and restarting, but I'm not sure if that would be the best course of action\n\nI appreciate the reply!",

As far as constructive criticism, I see that you are trying different topics that you think could do well, and you make the same type of content repeatedly. The problem is you don't have credibility to talk about certain subjects yet. For example, people are more inclined to listen to millionaire habits from proven millionaires.  Fitness advice from  bodybuilders. ETC.\n\nIf I were you, I would expand to TikTok and try to make  viral content. Follow the trends, try to pop with some short clips. Develop an audience. Then funnel that audience to YouTube through expanded versions of the TikTok content.",

I would choose one of those categories and the tunnel into it, and become the best analyst / commentator on that one single area\n\nEg. Don\u2019t just choose Fitness, instead dig into one single area of fitness and build an expertise around it. \n\nCould be something like: 3 Minute Workouts\n\n\u201cEveryone has 3 minutes. And every week, I bring you a high impact, 3 minute workout that targets different muscle groups that will transform your body\u2026 3 minutes at a time.\u201d\n\nSomething like that.\n\nEventually, you can scale out. \n\nSee what I mean?",

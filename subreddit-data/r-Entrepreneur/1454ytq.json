    "postText": "Hey there,  \nI have a 11k Facebook page that gained organic reach for years. I'm so busy to manage it and post on it now, yet I still get reactions on years' old posts, so it's pretty active and with consistency it could be really big. You can use it for just fun posts, or as a business. I've sold a page in the past and the buyer successfully sold a lot of services there.  \nYou can find it by searching for fb.com/easyhomeideas  \nMessage me with your offer and the page is yours :)  \nThanks",

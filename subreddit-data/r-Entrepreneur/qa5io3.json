We are figuring out what it means to be a software company, along with transition from the entrepreneur \u201cshoot from the hip\u201d to the professionally managed company that does strategic planning. Both are difficult. \n\nI\u2019m here relaxing watching football today, so figured I\u2019d have some time to answer any questions. \n\nOur company page is www.DieselLaptops.com, and you can find me on LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-robertson-diesel",

You need 3 things to do commercial truck diagnostics: A laptop, software, and a piece of hardware to go between the truck and laptops. Lots of companies sold the individual pieces, but we put a an affordable \u201ckit\u201d together. Seems common sense, but apparently lacking in our industry. Most of the sellers also just provided the tools, not the services to train and help those people fix trucks. We included that at well (We have 50+ in our call center, half of which are diesel techs). \n\nWe put so many services and products around the tool that it\u2019s hard for others to compete with us (We win 98% of the deals head-to-head with competitors). \n\nI also ran it differently. I\u2019ve kept every dollar possible in the company for years to keep growing.\n\nWe also only sell direct and do marketing predominately online. Our competitors do it more old school.\n\nIt\u2019s always been about the long term vision, not the short term. It helps not having investors and no debt so we can play that way.",

I have a company in agriculture, more livestock focused tho so I can't say that I'm not as super connected to the heavy equipment side of things. I'll ask one of my friends who runs heavy equipment tho.\n\nI'm also not sure how open ag equipment dealers would be to these, sometimes I feel like they don't like to do anything to risk existing relationships, and the big ag cos are assholes. Doesn't mean there isn't a market for it, but they can be super protectionist.\n\nIt looks cheap enough though that individual farmers or family owned companies might be interested. Theres definitely a lot of potential.\n\nAlso, do you have a referral or affiliate program of any kind? Not trying to money grub, but it is kinda nice to get a kick back for stuff here and there.",

My family happened to just buy a truck dealership franchise, which is where I started. My family just happened to be a family of business owners and entrepreneurs. I just happened to get fired from the company that bought the dealership from my family, which lead me to get that 10 years of paid training mentioned above. \n\nSo yes, previous experience plays a huge role. There are very few people on the planet that have the knowledge I do regarding commercial truck repair and the pieces that go with it. \n\nThe right set of experience/knowledge at the right time sometimes comes into alignment.",

It was easy for us to see if they\u2019d used the service or not and I argued that we refund those who asked and hadn\u2019t been using the service, Because it builds a good reputation and is the right thing to do.

Like when someone makes a mistake that damages some inventory, it\u2019s hard for me not to feel like that mistake just took a few hundred dollars out of my pocket. Being that personally invested is a lot of why I\u2019d be less likely to make that mistake to begin with. Whereas for an employee it\u2019s a strike against them that might put them one step closer to getting fired, but in the moment it\u2019s not like I can just dock their pay for that amount every time they make a mistake. I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a way to genuinely replicate that level of self-accountability, so I\u2019m learning to just accept that it\u2019s part of the inefficiency as the organization grows.",

College doesn\u2019t always mean that someone is educated enough to create a successful business. Grades also don\u2019t mean much, sure, statistically speaking some of the most successful people didn\u2019t do well in school (this doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t strive to have high grades!). Today\u2018s society makes it seem that people without a piece of paper (college/uni) are bound to not succeed. If your profession requires education (doctor, for example), then obviously you won\u2019t succeed without the degree, but if you\u2019re a graphics designer, for example, or 95% of IT professions, then you DO NOT REQUIRE a degree. Many IT companies don\u2019t even look at your degree, because experience and knowledge is what matters most. I hope this assists you and if you really want that degree, then go get it, dude! Don\u2019t let other peoples desires get in front of yours.",

I wasn\u2019t focused and didn\u2019t enjoy it, totally my fault. \n\nSecond time around I went back a couple years later and did an adult/night program to get my degree in Business. I was focused and enjoyed it, plus I was paying the bill this time. \n\nShort version is college doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. Plenty of dumb people I know who graduated college.  Plenty of successful people I know who didn\u2019t go to college.",

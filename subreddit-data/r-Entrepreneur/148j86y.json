    "postText": "I have a program in entrepreneurship. The main program is very hands on, but when I was at an alumni event, a teacher at my (former) high school asked me to be involved in his entrepreneurship course.\n\nLast spring I worked with his class, modifying my Powerpoint materials to make them more general, less hands-on. I also came into classes live talking to the students about 5 times, which gave  me a lot of good information about what's appropriate for this level of student and their final projects.\n\nI'm reaching out to the teacher to plan for next semester, but also, I'd like to sell this as a course to high schools. Has anyone worked with this market? What's the best way to reach them?\n\nMy high school is very prestigious and I'm hoping to get their endorsement on the course. That would I think help a lot.\n\nAlso, what do schools pay for course materials like this?",

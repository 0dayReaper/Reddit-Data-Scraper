    "postText": "For a bit of background, I'm a software engineer who's been attempting to strike gold with various projects since 2011. Before that, I served as a Fire Controlman in the Navy. My dream has always been to become a successful entrepreneur, and I thought I was putting in all the effort that most people shy away from. Despite pushing out project after project and sometimes outdoing my competition, I'm battling burnout and second-guessing if doing this solo was the right call.\r  \n\r  \nHere's a glimpse into what I've ventured into:\r  \n\r  \n1.) I developed a school security software suite. Despite having contracts with 120 schools, it was dropped when federal funding was cut.\r  \n\r  \n2.) I replicated OnlyFans using Laravel. Despite 500 sign-ups, I had to shut it down as it seemed it was predominantly used by lot-lizards, and I didn't want to risk facilitating illegal transactions.\r  \n\r  \n3.) I produced a comprehensive veterinary clinic management software suite, covering scheduling, inventory management, x-ray image integration, etc. Yet, I couldn't get a single vet to discuss it. Most of them were bound by multi-year contracts and hesitant to introduce potential tech issues into their operations. The classic, \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it\".\r  \n\r  \n4.) I created an IQ test based on a Jordan Peterson formula. It was generating $50 a day, but his team forced me to remove it. (I had used a video of him explaining how to make an IQ test on my landing page).\r  \n\r  \n5.) I figured out how to 3D print yurt frame hubs and even built a website that became a go-to place for yurt enthusiasts. However, my customers seemed more interested in tried and true brands than buying my yurts. Without a showroom (which I can't afford) and banks not being so liberal with loans, my hands are tied.\r  \n\r  \n6.) I started a digital card business. Not my brightest idea since the income is so negligible that maintaining it isn't worth the trouble.\r  \n\r  \nI've tried my hand at quite a few more ventures that I haven't mentioned here. But amidst all of these, there's one project that's doing fairly well: Buzzhumble, a search engine for dating apps. That's basically my full-time gig now. But I want to scale greater heights. I'm open to any and all advice. And if anyone is looking for a builder for their ideas, feel free to drop me a message. Currently feeling a bit adrift and could use some direction even if it means coding for free on a project just to make connections.",

After a while it got so frustrating that I forced myself to start a business doing something that I\u2019m good at and stick with it. I worked at a job while I worked on the business for free for over a year and then I went all in to the business. Haven\u2019t looked back since. \n\nSo basically what I am saying is you have to go through what most people don\u2019t want to go through and work for free for a while which nobody wants to do because they want instant results. If you are willing to sacrifice a year working lots of hours a week doing something you are good at and that has demand in this market then you will be set for great things!",

I hope you will make the most of it.\n\nyour problem is very clear- you are all over the place. Additionally, you appear to be in it for the wrong reasons.\n\nPerseverance and grit are key components of entrepreneurship, so you are \"made of the right stuff\", but if you don't focus those efforts on a singular purpose you are doomed to fail. Successful entrepreneurship is about delivering value for a well defined problem. You need to understand that the market is VERY tough and unforgiving. It is full of competitors who are more experienced and better resourced than you, many of which are equally driven to succeed. In order to stand a chance you need to be laser focused on your problem of interest. You need find a real business problem that has no solutions or (ideally) has some, but none that are good. You need to know your competition by heart, and understand the market dynamics. This typically only happens once you've been in and industry long enough. Jumping around is the opposite of what you need to do. You will keep skimming the surface, gaining only a superficial understanding, and never going deep enough to actually penetrate the market.\n\nFrankly speaking, you have two options here-\n\n1. Get a job in an industry you like, and spend a few years in it, really learning the ins and outs. However, you are unlikely to learn the business dynamics through a developer role, so I suggest the following instead:\n2. Find a CEO co-founder, someone who brings deep industry experience and is looking to solve a big problem in that industry, and is looking for a technical co-founder like you to help build the solution.\n\nEntrepreneurship is about passion for solving real business problems, not for striking gold. I hope you will find that passion.\n\nSOURCE: 3rd time founder, CEO/CTO with 15 years experience, built several large/successful businesses.",

I would not recommend this because they say picking the right business partner is harder then finding the right partner for marriage. I think the only time partnerships work is when both of the people are successful entrepreneurs and bring a lot of certain skills to the table that complement each other.",

    "postText": "I am starting a small powder coating business as a side gig and seeing where it goes.  I have a plan to start in my garage with a basic household oven, spray booth, and sand blaster.  The goal is to make this my main source of income within a couple years and move into a shop once the profit is there and is making more than I currently make (50K).  I will be re-investing everything into the business that is made in the beginning to buy better equipment as this will help me do larger items.  There is a need for this in my city as there is one industrial company and one smaller guy that is usually booked pretty far out.  I am doing this out of passion for wanting to help people with their custom cars, bikes, etc. as I am involved in the motorcycle scene locally.  I would hit the ground hard and start promoting my brand and services to shops after I have a good sample size.  I have always wanted to start a business to be my own boss and to have all the fruits of my labor go to something I built and this is the first business idea I have even gone past the idea process and starting to execute.  I am just looking for some insight and tips in starting a service based business.",

I looked in to purchasing one for a mobile laser cleaning service last year, as a retirement gig.  the prices started around $80K.  i still believe it's a good business to buy in to, if you have $100K plus for start up costs.  there's a distributor in missouri and one in florida.",

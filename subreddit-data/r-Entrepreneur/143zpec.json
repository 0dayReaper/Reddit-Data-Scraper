Teaching myself to code well enough to make an MVP would take a longer than finding an experienced coding partner for this specific app. \n\nI feel my best choice to find a TCO through asking other coders for feedback on the prototype. That way I get feedback on the prototype while also scouting for potential business partners, killing two birds with one stone. \n\nI\u2019m here to look for any advice from people who are knowledgeable about this process and if this is the best route to take.\n\nAny advice on what I should do next would help me out a ton!",

But most of the tools (including ours) can only generate code for simple to moderately complicated projects. So it will depend on the project. Is there a way to par down your MVP designs complexity? After all it is supppse to be a MVP to get users feedback to continue to iterate.",

And if you don't have the first idea who your cusotmer is, that might seem to be the right thing to do.\n\nBut it isn't really an MVP. And 'tech partners' have their own projects. But thanks for explaining why people partner, then bitch about it here.\n\nYou want to run your smoke test.\n\n&gt;The webpage can then be used to easily track and quantify early demand for your product in actual dollar-terms, which in turn can validate your hypothesis and determine whether you have a feasible business case. Since the users click on the CTA already pre-bought your product you can contact them after you developed your product and they will be most likely your first paid customers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why should I use Smoke Testing?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As Eric Ries says \u201cThe problem with entrepreneurship is we are often working really hard producing high-quality products that no-one wants\u201d. Smoke testing prevents this before you start to develop your product. Build it and they will come days are over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Smoke Test Before MVP](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/smoke-test-before-mvp-62073460b8)\n\nClearly Build It And They Will Come found new life right here. But with a positive market experiment -- that means you didn't bother screwing yourself over -- you will attract a partner. And without showing partners the money, they tend to treat you like a dirty diaper.\n\nRepeat: If you put up a landing page with Buy Now button, and if 34,276 people click in a reasonable amount of time, you have your choice of code monkeys and launch monkeys. \n\n[3 Awesome Minimum Viable Products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPJoq_QVsY4) shows wantrepreneurs what they just [do not want to know](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mupm4w/comment/gv8mh4q/?context=3). You do not launch first, ask questions later. Because the number one question is going to be [Getting The First 100 and 1000 Paying Customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/kc5eee/getting_the_first_10_and_1000_paying_customers/gfod409/?context=3) which is always the wrong question.",

It's routinely used for ignoring the fact that every venture requires marketing, eyeballs on it, and a bit of luck. \n\nThe amount of fucking business idiots I've heard use this phrase as rationale, including the head of the PGA, is just unfathomable. Pure Idiocracy, driven from a book about ghosts appearing in a cornfield telling you to invest money in a highly risky project. \n\nI couldn't even read further, that's how rageful that stupid sentence makes me. Nothing against you, I'm sure you wrote great things, but my god I hate that phrase above all else in the business world.",

One hundred percent had some reason or another why they did not perform one.\n\nAs for marketing -- the very same people who launch first, ask questions later also believe marketing is forcing yourself upon the market. First casualty is always market demand research and, you guessed it, smoke testing.\n\nOddly enough, offline a version of the smoke test called a pop-up market experiment has become the best practice. Online, it's as if not one soul has heard of the widespread practice.\n\nYou form a corporate shell. You learn to write code or you may hire or partner. You may lease space. You can develop a site, a social presence. You may not run a smoke test.\n\nThis is called 'minimal' without any trace of humor or irony.",

    "postText": "It's been 5 years owning a women's clothing boutique in my town. The first two years were amazing, made a ton of money. But since Covid I haven't even been breaking even, using a lot of my own money to pay expenses like rent and employees, I've borrowed money from family to purchase new inventory, hoping it would refresh things and stir up more business. Some days are decent but some days no sales at all. I keep thinking if I hold on a little longer it will get back to where it used to be and I can pay myself and family members back! But the more I wait the more money I shell out. I just don't know what career I would even do if I closed the store. Im 30 with two kids, I've been doing this for 6 years, I hardly have a diverse resume compared to other 30 year olds. I also feel like id be letting so many people down, including myself. Not to mention, when things do get back to normal, the business that comes in after me would reap all the benefits of my current great location... but maybe I shouldn't think about that.",

The harsher reality is that we're in the middle of a massive economic downturn, and it's likely to remain this way for a while. People were bored and had extra money from the pandemic, so they shopped and spent more.   \n\n\nIf you aren't getting the foot traffic, then you need to rethink your marketing strategy. If you are relying on just passing traffic to come in, and they aren't buying anything, then you need to rethink your product offering and pricing. If you are passionate about your business, it doesn't hurt to chat with the people who do come in and leave without buying, get some valuable feedback as to what the problem is.\n\nOnly you can decide when to throw in the towel. If it's bleeding your dry and revamping your offering isn't worth it, then it might be time to head back into the work force. Customer service and business management is absolutely a transferable skill to almost any industry. Don't sell yourself short.",

You need to find a hobby, or spending time with family/friends to recharge your emotional needs. It can be an easy thing to overlook, but it's necessary for you to get through times like the one that you're experiencing now.\n\nWithout trying to suggest more ways to spend money, you didn't mention what you are doing (or not doing) for marketing. Try looking into ways to market your business that don't cost a lot, or anything except for your time.\n\nFor example, what are you doing on Instagram? Women's clothing is something that lends itself well to IG. Your store should have an account and you should be taking photos of 1 item a day minimum, doing a write-up for it, and use hashtags that are local to drive eyeballs to your posts. Once you are doing that, move up to reels for bigger items. Do a reel for your store. Think of monthly events or promotions or seasonal draws to attract people to come browse inside your store.\n\nI know that this requires more time and energy, and you're feeling depressed already, but I have seen it work before for clients, especially if they are enthusiastic about the subject matter. Find value in what you write up, educate people about styles and different pieces of clothing. Make suggestions for birthdays, mother's day, seasonal holidays where people are looking for a new outfit. Think of the entertainment &amp; educational value that you can offer and people will follow your channel.\n\nGood luck.",

(I.e. Tik Tok, Instagram, Facebook) \n\nI ask, because marketing tends to be the first part that gets cut when looking at expenses, but it\u2019s what markets your item from the competitors. Have you tried selling clothes on Tik Tok or Instagram? I know of a lot of boutiques who built a following, and they do Live video purchases. \n\nIf you\u2019re at your last leg, I\u2019d recommend investing in some marketing. Ask a firm to draw you up the demographics, who your consumer base is, and go from there. *Then*, I\u2019d ask around if there are ANY marketing, comms, Public relations students out there who might be looking for some experience. \n\nThey trade you marketing material = They get a chance to \u201cwork\u201d for a brand. Believe me, there\u2019s nothing more enticing that hearing that a business may want to use you to film a video or create a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats). \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to spend no money; I would definitely recommend going the student route and seeing if you can find a student willing to work for experience.

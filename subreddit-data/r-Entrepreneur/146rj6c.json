If you test, there will be a lot of failures for every success. And sorry to burst anybody's bubble, but that's what MVP was supposed to be about before it was bastardized.\n\nLarger point being there is no getting around startup statistics. Your priority is to look before you leap, don't dump in a lot of money right off and have nothing left and no recourse but to drive straight ahead.\n\nPull the plug promptly, knowing you did your best, then move on decisively and quickly. You won't be able to do that if you half-ass something.",

What\u2019s causing you to get burnt out, gotta figure that out.\n\nIf your trying to build a million dollar business don\u2019t get all concern with the early money. You will get there one day and burn through $25k like it was breakfast. \n\nFocus on bringing in new money always so you don\u2019t need to worry about your money! \n\nMake money first, 2nd make more money. Once you have the money sorted the investors will come a lot easier. (Their only interested in seeing how much money you can make them) If only I was told this in the beginning!",

            "comment": "Dude, I feel you! Being a startup/side hustle addict can be a rollercoaster ride. Three failed startups? That's tough, but props to you for learning some solid lessons along the way. Burnout is a real buzzkill, no doubt about it.\r  \n\rNow, how long you take a break really depends on you, your mental state, and how well you've recharged your batteries. Taking 6-7 weeks off is a decent chunk of time, and if you're starting to feel that entrepreneurial itch again, it might be a sign that you're ready to dive back in. Just make sure you're not jumping the gun too soon. Take a moment to reflect on what went wrong with your previous ventures and how you can avoid those pitfalls in the future.\r  \n\rBefore you jump headfirst into another idea, my advice is to do some soul-searching and self-reflection. Ask yourself if you've fully recovered from the burnout and if you're mentally prepared to give it your all again. Take the lessons you learned from your past failures and use them as building blocks for your next venture.  \nAlso, make sure you're not just chasing the thrill of starting something new. Ensure that you have a solid plan, a clear understanding of your target market, and a viable product or service to offer. Don't rush into things without testing the waters and getting some solid validation.  \nRemember, it's okay to take risks and embrace your entrepreneurial spirit, but be smart about it. Take calculated steps, surround yourself with a supportive network, and stay resilient when the going gets tough. Wishing you all the best as you scratch that startup itch once again!",

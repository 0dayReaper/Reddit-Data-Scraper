He has two partners one is an electrician just like him and the other is a sales guy who is a great ppl person and is suppose to get clients for them. Said sales person has been MIA for a hot minute and the whole thing seems to be starting to sink. They wanted to get into installing ev chargers etc but they\u2019re having issues finding a suitable supplier. Anyways they are trying to source clients and start getting jobs related to electrical in general like service upgrades, panel relocations, lights, plugs, any and everything. We really just want to start rolling the wheels and not let it sink. We need clients, any ideas on where to start? I\u2019m trying to get some social media set up for them etc but any advice is sincerely appreciated. I am also an electrician so I was hoping to gain some good experience working with them. They had such a great start and have already worked with a couple of clients but I just feel like after the honeymoon phase of it being so new everything rolled to a stop. (Based in Canada btw)",

            "comment": "Hey there! There are ways to get things rolling again. First, make connections within the industry by attending trade shows and joining professional organizations to meet other electricians and contractors who can refer clients. Also, set up social media profiles and a website to showcase their services and connect with potential clients. Don't forget to list the company in online directories and consider partnerships with local businesses in need of electrical services. Targeted online ads and a referral program can also help attract new clients. Just keep at it, stay persistent, and things will start picking up again! Good luck!",

Make sure it\u2019s made well and has all your keywords and looks good and loads fast \n\n2) set up your google business profile and get it verified. Then get as many people as you can to review it. More 5 star reviews = more visibility on google. And more consumer trust. \n\n3) run ads with a competent google ads person. Be ready to spend $2500+ a month on ad spend to get any good results. \n\nI\u2019ve done this plenty of times for businesses like yours. I can send you references who I even worked with off this sub. So if you need help with any of this feel free to PM me and see if there\u2019s anything I can do to help. Had a locksmith in a similar situation. Things are looking up for them!",

    "postText": "I'm 19yo from a middle class background. I seriously wanna be a Gazillionaire by 30. I'm doing whatever is practically possible for me to do solo. I learnt App/Web dev. Doing projects, internships and also building and posting apps on PlayStore.\nBut you know it's not enough. \n\nBy \"Can you adopt me\" I mean can you be my 2nd dad and guide me through the process. Give me directions. And alert me before a mistake. \n\nI'm not asking for any money to skip the hard part. But want a support hand to increase my survival changes during the process. \n\nI know alot of people are going to troll me now but I know they ain't the people with any unrealistic goals and never realised how hard it is to shift from middle class to high class. Infact they wouldn't read it all lol.\n\nIf anyone is genuinely interested, please feel free to DM me.\n\nAlso if there's other people out there like me, let me know maybe we can make it like an online school. Where self-made people will teach and interact with us on zoom, kinda like a class .",

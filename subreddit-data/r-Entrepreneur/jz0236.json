    "postText": "Hi all, my biz just reach a $80m valuation after a tonne of hard work but my click-bait title is designed to outline whats wrong in this Sub-reddit.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the content here doesn't represent true entrepreneurs but rather wantrepreneurs that think you need a crazy idea to make it, you have too many great ideas and can't focus,  how you make a tonne of cash without working hard.\n\nIn this post, I am just going to lay out some home truths in the hope that maybe one person may not waste their hard earned money on a silly idea, or perhaps stop daydreaming and start doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Entrepreneurship is NOT about big ideas**\n\nThere are 5.6m [employer firms in the USA,](https://sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/) thats at least 5.6m entrepreneurs in the USA. Most of these entrepreneurs have businesses in existing industries. People today have been poisoned by click bait regarding geniuses like Mr. Zuck or Page. &amp; Brin who have dominated their fields and created wealth beyond anyone's wildest dreams yet their ideas weren't original, [Google wasn't the first search engine.](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/how-search-worked-before-google-1703.html) It wasn't the second, not even the third.\n\nSuccessful business is all about execution. A great team with a dull and mundane product are so much more likely to get succeess than a college grad with a big dream.\n\n* If you feel that being an entrepreneur requires a big idea, you are a wantrepreneur\n* If you carry a notebook with all yout great ideas, you are a wantrepreneur.\n* If you have so many great ideas but just lack focus (also known as as the ability to execute well), you are a wantrepreneur\n\nEvery headhunter that starts their own headhunting firm is an entrepreneur and they aren't doing anything massively different, they just back themselves to execute better. Lawyers who make their own practices are entrepreneurs, you don't need to create the next automated legal subscription service to be an entrepreneur.\n\nEither learn a business, get great, save up and then launch a slightly differentiated business or focus on looking for problems in the job you currently are doing.\n\nStop dreaming, start executing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Successful entrepreneurs spend more time empowering others to build their business**\n\nA lot of people lurking around this sub seem to relish the idea of bring their big idea to life. I have news for you; this process is maybe 6-18months of your business. The rest is incremental improvements and empowering others to grow your business further.\n\nMaybe you are working in a 9-5 job and dreaming via this sub is a way to keep you sane but remember when you have 100 people working for you, you have 100 people potentially thinking of ways to move to the next thing. Who doesn't want to be a tech millionaire! Remember, you probably think you are under-paid and under-appreciated but every person you employ will think similar!\n\nEven if you have the experience, drive and ingenuity to build the beginnings of a business, you can only grow it so much before you need to rely on others. If you cannot empower those people, you will not execute and you will not succeed.\n\nA manager who knows how to empower and excite their sub-ordinates is so much more value than someone who wants to create 'strategy' all the time. If you don't have this skill yet, you will need a co-founder does or you will need to get more corporate experience\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Businesses aren't built for you**\n\nMany posts on this sub talk are variants of get rich quick schemes or figuring out how to 'side hustle'. At the heart of it, many wantrepreneurs think that working for themselves will bring immense freedom and untold riches.\n\nWhen you employ 100 people, you are **responsible** for the livelihoods of 100 people. You are priority 2 vs your staff. Businesses need people and people need to believe that their fearless leader can make great outcomes for them!\n\nThink about that for a second. Are you mature enough to be responsible for 100 families rent or mortgage? Do you realize that a silly decision on your side could actually create financial hardship for others?\n\nIf your business is not built to make your employees lives better, your great employees will churn out and your business and you will not succeed.\n\nWhen you look at your spreadsheet imaginging the $100m net income from your online bow-tie emporium, just remember, those 'staff' numbers will become real people. Be prepared to look after them.\n\nManaging your staff well is worth 100x that zany, crazy idea.... soz\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why do you want to be an entrepreneur?**\n\nI think that by now I can call myself a successful entrepreneur and while I am a wealthy human on paper, I am grinding and saving like everyone else. In fact, my sister who is a few years younger than me and who works in law earns **triple** what I do whilst complaining that she doesn't have the work freedom.\n\nIf you just want to be wealthy, without the hassle of all the above, try your best to get into those premier industries and make a career out of it. If you aren't fortunate enough to be able to move into Law, medicine, finance etc then excel at what you are currently doing and then do exactly the same thing yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that is enough of a rant. Dreaming is great because the thought of being successful can fill that emotional void but unfortunately it isn't real. Furthermore, if you think that being an entrepreneur means being the next Zuck or equivalent, you are essentially trying to replicate 0.01% of successful entrepreneurs as opposed to the 99.99% unsung business owners out there\n\nGood luck to all!",

James Leprino DID go into a traditional industry (cheese), but found a niche no other cheesemaker was exploiting well: pizza in the 1950s.\n\nHe also did great customer research to understand where the holes were he could fill:\n\n\"Leprino's first coup came in 1968, when Pizza Hut was looking for a supplier that could help it cut costs while standardizing portions. After hearing that shredding 5-pound cheese blocks in the franchises was time-consuming and inconsistent, Leprino Foods started selling frozen, presliced blocks. For the first time, pizza-makers could simply layer a few slices onto each pie.\"\n\nYes, if you want to be an entrepreneur, just do it. But most of the theory from how to run a good startup (find a niche, do great customer research, innovate new ideas) applies also. Don't \"just\" do things the way everyone else does. Learn how it's done in the industry now, find out the pains that still exist, cure those pains.\n\n(Leprino has more than 50 patents in cheese. He's an innovator. \"As Jerry Graf, a former cheese buyer for Pizza Hut, notes, 'Jim was always one step ahead of the game.'\")\n\nI agree with OP's general sentiment, though. Don't just ride on an idea like \"hydrogen powered scooters.\" Do something. Whatever's possible, with whatever resources you have NOW.",

This is how average entrepreneurs get their average results. But at least they get results than not getting any results at all.\n\nYou even hint in your post by subtle ways to your own luck and high you got from this evaluation. Don't forget that what really matters is if actually selling to end consumers, how much selling, etc.\n\nWorking hard, getting focus, getting to work. Classic but dumb. It doesn't actually tell much, merely meaningless overgeneralized unhelpful advice. While it contains truth, and also why wantrepreneurs eat this up, getting their high, nonetheless they stay in confusion about what it means to actually apply this advice.\n\nYou who likes this post remember: nothing gets implemented without ideas. And for this same reason, non-executers won't make transition to execution without ideas that would enable them to do so.\n\nThose executors who have better ideas will outperform those executors who have less good ideas. And those who have dreams that are powerful enough to get them to work to making those dreams happen, and get them to persist in face of difficulties, are the ones who go much farther than those who come to say that stop dreaming and get to work.\n\nWhen dream doesn't get person to action, to making it real, then it might be person's fear or presently comfortable life that holds stronger than its dream of a better place.\n\nBetter advice, as idea, to wantrepreneurs, might be to start selling your idea to other people who can help to make this dream happen. It requires talking to other people. Learn sales. And don't learn it from books. Go out there and start selling something you think is great.",

If you don't have a plan towards a place where your business can just work without your presence, the old businessman proverb applies - \"you don't have a business - you have a job and you work for a psychopath\".",

            "comment": "It's all well and good, but being the largest chopstick or toothpick factory takes significant capital investment.\n\nEven being a small one takes a lot of investment unless you plan on hand whittling them.\n\nWhen someone is the dominant player in an industry, they have a lot of levers that you don't have. They are in all the restaurants already. They have distribution. Most importantly, they have inertia going for them - people don't like to change. There's only going to be probably 3 huge distributors, maybe the top 100 sell over 98% of the toothpicks or chopsticks, and if you are the #1 supplier, it's easy to keep those customers if you are attentive.\n\nWhat happens to the restaurant owner decides to buy toothpicks from your company, and finds out they were accidentally laden with arsenic and 5 people get sick or die from your toothpicks? That's what I would tell customers if I was in the largest toothpick company - why go with the unknown\n\nThese are the questions that roll around in my head when I want to buy something. Why go with the smallest company instead of the sure thing? They largest company is the largest for a reason.\n\nSure, you could niche it out and maybe make solid gold toothpicks at a premium price, [but they already exist](https://www.rubylane.com/item/510967-rbx20x232600/Diamond-Toothpick-14k-Gold?search=1&amp;t=5c431c3b). \n\nProbably every toothpick and chopstick niche you could find is filled and their products fill the distribution channel. Look on ebay - there are tons of gold toothpicks to choose from.\n\nThe saying is to find a niche where you can be a monopoly, but there are so many players, they already know this, too. It's no secret. \n\nI know the whole \"there's a big market, they sell because there's a big demand,\" but you cannot treat competition like it is nothing - competitors are out there employing people just as smart as you, but with more experience and contacts, and they want the same contracts as you do. \n\nFor example, there are a lot of need for electricians, but if you live in a small community of 400 people and there's been an electrician that has been doing this for 25 years and everyone uses him, good luck with providing electrician services. There's only 400 people in the community, and the next community is 80 miles away, but you want to stay in your town, you're going to have a rough time of it, despite all the \"rah-rah start a plain business like an electrician or plumber.\" Competition is a real thing.\n\nAnd the real problem is cash flow. How long can one stay in business, if orders don't flow in as fast and reliably as was hoped? What happens if you go out door-to-door offering to paint houses, you have a professional do the door hangers, but despite going out 5 hours per day, and completely covering the entire neighborhoods, you don't get enough jobs to pay rent or mortgage, food, clothing, dental and health, gas, auto repairs and insurances, etc? It's happened to me, went door-to-door, but just never grew enough to support myself.\n\nI don't really have an answer. I'm just saying that while what the OP wrote is true, it is also true that \"tried and true\" industries are no panacea, too. I've gone into a lot of industries that are \"plain.\" Fucking shit is difficult as hell, too. I've failed at companies that have lots of demand but a lot of competitors, because there are a lot of competitors. I tried to niche, but purchasers don't give a fuck about that. You can say you're a bookkeeper that specializes in pet shops, the pet shop ain't going to give a fuck, they like their current bookkeeper even if he or she doesn't specialize in it. Or if you charge $2000 per month as  a specialist and someone else charges $1000 per month, good luck with that nicheing thing, because purchasers have heard it all before. I've heard it all before. It's all the same noise.\n\nI'm not trying to be a bummer, or dissuade or persuade anyone. I'm just stating my experiences, same as the OP. I surely don't have the answers.",

Find one person willing to pay you for a service or product.  From there, you can build a business through solid execution, and it is very much like adding the wings onto the airplane as it is heading down the runway towards take off.  As you grow, a book like Traction (EOS Operating system) is a gold standard for many entrepreneurs.  This helps you learn how to delegate and slowly remove yourself from the business.

One is struggling.  The one that is struggling is a situation where we are waiting to get approved for a distribution license and it is taking way too long!).  In terms of communities, I've found EO (Entrepreneurs Organization) to be very helpful.  Last, one of my early mentors told me, \"The eyes only see and the ears only hear what your brain is looking for.\"  We can look for evidence of corruption and negativity and spend our lives focusing on the injustices in the world.  Easy to do, especially today.  Or we can focus on opportunities in our corner of the planet, help solve a few small problems for people either as a gig or something that can be turned into a business.  It's our choice where we focus our attention.",

I've had the luck of working on positions that require A to Z meaning in not only experienced in engineering things like product development but also manufacturing, vendor sourcing, sales, and even troubleshooting and support of end customers.  It's only AFTER a decade of doing all this that I even feel comfortable attempting starting my own business.  And you know what the last thing on my list is?  Money.  Everything starts with a solid business model.  You want something that actually works, actually fits the intended market, will actually sell, and will be something that isn't wasteful and a drain on resources.  You don't want to have to put in 100 hour weeks just to survive.  You don't want to build a model that crushes you and in a few years leaves you broke.  Planning and information is everything.  You NEED solid fundamentals.  If you're growing a tree, the roots need to be solid.  The business model needs to be solid.  You need to plan and research.  You need to hunt for information or do market research to build that information.  I work for an OEM that builds for a lot of the main brands.  We design our own stuff and have our own branding, but we also design and build for customers (companies or individuals).  We even bring customer ideas and prototypes to market.  Even in this environment, there's still a lot of mistakes, a lot of waste, and business paths that end as failures.  We've made products that should have made us millions a year but ended up costing us money, simply due to a few bad choices.  This always happens.  Success comes from smart planning and smart execution.  It comes from good fundamentals and market awareness.  I have big ideas too.  I just know that most aren't good.  I also know that it takes a TON of upfront work to be efficient and effortless through fruition.  It's all the stuff you don't see that breeds success.",

The math behind VC fund structure means that an exit must return &gt;50% of fund size to be a real \"win.\" Anything else gets some cash returned to investors but won't likely make the fund top tier. Ideally, a fund makes 10-15 investments, 2 of them return 1x the fund size, 2 of them return some cash, 1-2 are alive but not meaningful exits in the future, and the rest are dead. That's a top decile VC fund.\n\nVCs *can't* care about mediocre exits - especially as fund sizes increase - because they are almost irrelevant to fund performance. Big wins make or break the fund, so of course they will push for those outcomes.",

I couldn't get past the limit of what I could as a single person (and supervising people in doing the same things I previously did).\n\nI ran myself into the ground, eventually got isolated (no partner), and found myself fantasizing about jumping off the office building I worked in.\n\nwas a cool story and makes for a good resume, though, I guess...",

I have a good bit of experience as a manager/supervisor and am generally pretty good at inspiring my subordinates and coworkers around ideas, but I get overwhelmed with the sheer level of information I\u2019m presented with when trying to get a business going (business licensing, taxes, etc). I also fell down the \u201chustle mentality\u201d rabbit hole for a while and got really discouraged because of it. I\u2019m finally back on the right path and hoping to get something started seriously in the next 12 months. This post was a lot of what I needed to hear right now, though. Thank you.",

Really the only two goals I wanted to start my business of some sort was to make enough to pay my student loans lol. $250 a month is good and anything more means I can reinvest in the business or buy some beer to be honest.\n\nAt first i was stuck on the \u201coriginal idea\u201d but kinda figured that wasn\u2019t the point. As you said, lawyers, accountants, and financial planners start their own practices based on their skill and knowledge. How big they get is another story and of course, we all aren\u2019t gonna be the next apple, google, or whatever.\n\nI figured if I\u2019m gonna start a business and work outside of my normal 9-5 then it needs to be fun and something I\u2019m good at/know well. \n\nIn the end i figured solid cologne/perfume and maybe other natural goods. There\u2019s def a market for it. I was/am intimidated by the competition, especially on the Etsy side, but what I do notice is lack of...brand. They\u2019re all the same; some same old same old logo, usual scent combinations, whatever. When the market is saturated I think it\u2019s a good idea to lean heavy on branding and marketing, could be wrong but I remember a chart about something in my marketing 101 class way back in junior year college.\n\nI\u2019ve made a few samples and sold them discount to friends and had good reviews,right now I\u2019m focused on keeping people buying and building my brand. Eventually after the pandemic I plan on getting a vendor license and selling directly downtown on a pop up shop. \n\nAt the end of the day though, I want to see how crazy I can get with something as simple as solid cologne. Shake shit up, have fun, and break even lmao. Tbh, breaking even after I sell everything in bulk is only like 3 or 4 sales. \n\nIt\u2019ll be fun, and it\u2019s all good practice. If I get tired of it, I can move on to another venture when the idea rises.",

I agree with your post but I also think it skips over the concept of true innovation.\n\nIn Peter Thiel\u2019s \u201czero to one\u201d he talks about the concept of going from zero to one as opposed to going from 1 to n. Creating a new product or service that is so revolutionary/innovative is considered going from zero to one by creating a new industry essentially. It is truly creation of something new. Improvements upon existing products and services or even completely redesigning something from the ground up is considered going from 1 to n. While the solution is improved and may better solve the problem,  it still attempts to solve the same problem instead of creating a solution for a problem that has never been solved or considered.\n\nWhere does this fit into your post and can you speak a little on your thoughts concerning revolutionary businesses.\n\nWhile I understand not everyone can realistically expect to have a revolutionary business, my goal of being an entrepreneur is to attempt to find solutions for problems that have yet to be solved, specifically in the field of automation. I think the future is begging for automation and that the world is moving towards a future with less human labor. Obviously I\u2019m still very young and naive but I\u2019m trying to learn more and broaden my perspectives.",

Perhaps OP\u2019s business owns some sort of IP or has some kind of outrageous growth potential to merit that valuation. Depending on the industry (because it does vary), most small-medium business might fairly be worth 5x-ish net earnings, maybe somewhat more if it\u2019s a business that is structured in such a way as to be self-sustaining without too much executive-dependence. But if a \u201ctypical\u201d company with $20M annual revenue has net earnings of around 10%, you might expect a valuation of $10M-ish. But all these estimates go right out the window if we are talking about a business that is an up-and-coming tech or software thing, or owns something like a patent that has substantial potential value to someone. My only point is that your average run-of-the-mill business (like, let\u2019s say, a large plumbing company) that does $20M in revenue isn\u2019t worth anywhere near $80M.",

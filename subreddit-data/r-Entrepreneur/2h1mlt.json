    "postText": "**TLDR:** I bought a site on reddit for 4K, partnered with another redditor, and together we spent 2 months completely retooling the business.  We followed this up with 3 months of marketing, and we\u2019re now less than 30 days away from $100K in revenue.  \n \nThis is a post on how we did it.\n \n(Read time: ~15 minutes).  \n  \nGrab a cup of coffee and get comfy!  I\u2019ll get right to it. \n \n \n**THE INNER WORKINGS OF A SUBSCRIPTION BOX COMPANY.**\n \nSo about 6 months ago, I came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zn089/i_am_looking_for_some_advice_on_selling_a_website/) from a guy looking to sell a website he owned: \n \nI contacted him and found out that it was [wetshaveclub.com](http://www.wetshaveclub.com/), a wet shaving subscription box. I felt like I could make it work given the fact that dollar shave club had proven out the model. \u201cOk, Let\u2019s do it!\u201d  This was the extent of my analysis on this. The site owner sent me a screenshot of his revenue, I offered about 15X his monthly profits, and we wrapped everything up that same weekend.  We skipped the usual back and forth dance people go through when they\u2019re buying websites.  I sent over the money, he sent over the passwords, and that was that.\n \nI reached out to redditor u/kaster who I had been talking to on skype for some time. He had read [my original series of posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/), followed it to launch and grow a local business to 40k/month, sold it, and spent a few months in Costa Rica on vacation. We had never met, but I felt like he would be the perfect person to work on this with me.  This is a guy that does not play around when an opportunity presents itself.  Case in point: A few weeks later he was in his car for a 5-day drive from California to the east coast so we could work on this. ([Kevin\u2019s Facebook post as he was hitting the road](http://imgur.com/rMYvzJU)).\n \nOk, so here\u2019s what we did to get moving:\n   \n**Step 1: Website Rebranding**  \nThe original website needed some work and we set out to change the look and feel of it.  Design is critical, and even more so with a consumer product where emotion is a large component of the buying decision.  [Click to see of our branding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/HZJqP)\n \n**Step 2: Expanding the Product line and raising prices**  \nSo the original service only delivered soaps and at a price of $12 per month.  We felt that we had to double that price to make this worthwhile.  In order to do this we had to expand the product line and provide more value.  [Click to see how we expanded our product line.](http://imgur.com/a/CBzSZ)\n \n**Step 3: Box Rebranding**  \nSince we were now shipping more products (and we had rebranded the site), the next effort was to find a box that worked.  We called around to different box suppliers and had them send us samples.  We settled on Salazar packaging.  We sent them our box design and they got on it.  [Click to see our box rebranding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/sR1mN)\n \n**Step 4: Increasing prices and adding annual option**    \nEverything so far took us about 2 months of balls-to-the-wall work, but things were starting to shape up.  We were then able to increase prices to $29 for the monthly box instead of $12.  We also added an annual version at a reduced monthly rate to see if people would prepay for an entire year.  And they did.  [Click to see our new pricing options](http://imgur.com/Q7Lwyit).\n \n**Step 5: Marketing**  \nSo with our conversion rates up, and our box at a higher price point we were able to unleash the hounds.  You\u2019ll see that most of what we do is completely free marketing mixed in with a few paid sources.  [Click to see how we drive traffic.](http://imgur.com/a/CUDIH)\n \n**Step 6: Ordering, Warehouse and Shipping**  \nSo with the results of our efforts, we needed space.  We were shipping from our living room and while I had a small office, there was no way we could do it from there any longer.  So we found an office/warehouse, moved in 10 days later and got everything set up.  [Click to peep the warehouse](http://imgur.com/a/Gf3LP).\n \n**Bonus**: [Our new office](http://imgur.com/a/ojqCT).\n \n\nSo the result of all this work:\nWe\u2019re going to hit $100K in revenue in the next 30 days, and just passed $78K ([Obligatory screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/PBmXMxs.png)).  We did $22K last month ([Cratejoy screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FDhitpp.png))-They have pretty awesome analytics btw, and we\u2019re on pace to do $35K in September.  We think we can hit our first $100K month in 6-12 months and join the ranks of /u/bandholz from beardbrand.com. Dude knows his stuff and I respect how much he shares with the community.  In some ways I think we\u2019re cut from the same cloth, he\u2019s just smarter and better looking!  \n \nWhat Comes Next:  We\u2019re launching an accompanying ecommerce store.  This way, when folks find products that they like in the box, they can order more of them.  In addition, we can expand the product line a bit to include additional grooming products and other men\u2019s accessories. [Click for a sneak peak of the upcoming store](http://imgur.com/a/J4kpq).\n \n**TAKEAWAYS FROM ALL OF THIS!**\n \nThis is hard work and we made a lot of mistakes and will continue to make more.  We\u2019re working every day on providing a better customer experience and trying to improve the product line.  We went into this not knowing a thing about selling and shipping products, logistics, inventory, warehousing, or even wet shaving for that matter.  But we live in the information age.  Anything under the sun can be figured out if you\u2019re resourceful enough and willing to bust your ass until you make yourself an expert in that thing.  We\u2019re not well connected, nor do we access to a gazillion dollars in VC funding.  We just work.  Hard. And we\u2019re just getting started.\n \n**The companies that made this happen:** \n \nCratejoy.com for our subscription box web platform.  (Awesome service and Amir rocks!)  \nSalazarpackaging.com for our box (Great to work with)  \nSonicprint.com for our inserts (Karen is the bomb)  \n99designs.com for our design work (I wish I owned this company)  \nUline.com for our warehouse shelving and box fill (Their delivery speed is insane)  \nShipstation.com: (Integrates with cratejoy to handle our shipping. This gives us life!!)  \nEndicia.com: (Integrates with Shipstation so we just print labels from our computer. The truth!)  \nStripe.com: Payment processor (You already know)  \nPerfectaudience.com: Re-targeting (Works. Well! ROI positive and helps with branding too)  \nKabbage.com: $15,000 Line of credit (Surprisingly smooth experience)  \nGleam.io: Contests (Super awesome set up and easy to add virality to your contests through sharing)  \nTeamBeachBody.com: (haha, we do insanity every morning before work! Thanks Sean T)\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, props.  \n\n**This is where the case study ends!**\n******\n \n  \nBut if you\u2019re interested in taking a look at the mindset that has gotten us to this point, read on.\n \nLaunching something:  \nI read almost every front-page thread on r/entrepreneur and have done so for the past 2 years, so I know a lot of folks are stuck right now with coming up with something to launch.  Here\u2019s what I would do if I wanted to start a new business today and had no idea what to do next:\n \n1) Check your bank account for something you\u2019ve spent money on in the last 12 months. Bonus points if it\u2019s a recurring service of some sort (Your customer lifetime value is instantly boosted, and you can thrive even with a high customer acquisition cost).   Either way, you know it\u2019s something that people already spend money on.  This simple rule eliminates fantasy ideas: \u201cIf I get enough members I\u2019ll figure out how to monetize it later.\u201d  Later never comes, so ideas like these don\u2019t get a minute of my time.  **The only things I work on are things where I can make money starting on DAY ONE!**  \n  \n2)Narrow down the list to things where a lot of people are making money in that industry.  Competition is good.  I know, this goes against everything you\u2019ve learned somewhere.  But the more **thriving** competition you find, the more money is being made, and the larger the market.  Join the party, throw your hat in the ring, and be at least as smart as somebody there.  **Most people search for a great idea with no competition without realizing that this makes it almost impossible to start something.**  \n  \n3) Narrow things further to something that can be delivered with a simple but well designed website that cost no more than a month\u2019s salary.  If it\u2019s a product, you\u2019ll then have to find someone that will let you re-sell his or her product.  If it\u2019s a service, you simply have to find someone that already provides that service.  In both cases (product or service) you\u2019re just re-selling something, and with a well-designed website, you\u2019ll double your chances that your supplier will feel comfortable enough to let you resell their thing.  Yes, good design is important for both your customers and your suppliers!  **Don't launch with bad design!!! MVP or not!**   \n   \n4) When you get that \u201cYes\u201d from a supplier, make sure you set things up so that you\u2019re not in the customer\u2019s way.   Make things as easy as possible for them to do business with you.  Seriously, remove all hoops.  **They should be able to do business with you as easily as they do business with Amazon.**  If you don\u2019t need that extra field on the form, get rid of that shit.  As easy as humanly possible! \n   \n5) Market your thing until you pass out.  If your thing is something that really speaks to a person\u2019s identity like grooming, fashion, makeup, fitness, etc. [you can kill on social media](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/steal-your-competitions-followers/) (twitter, instagram, Facebook, YouTube).  If your thing is more detached from a person\u2019s identity like say a car wash or home cleaning, your best conversions will come through search (adwords, seo, yelp).  \n******  \n**A few additional thoughts:**  \nI think that a lot of \u201cstartup best practices\u201d work well for people that have access to funding.  For the rest of us, some of the generally accepted ideas end up pushing folks further away from launching something.  Consider:\n \n**Validation:** Validation in my opinion is for fantasy ideas.  If you stay away from having to come up with an awesome idea, you won\u2019t need validation in the first place. There are plenty of things you can do that other companies have already validated for you.  And when you find that thing, stop worrying about competition.  **Competition IS the validation.**  \n \n**Competition:** Stop measuring this by quantity.  One of the first things you\u2019ll hear is \u201cthe market is oversaturated\u201d!  This is meaningless, yet this single phrase has stopped more potential entrepreneurs in their tracks than\u2026well I honestly can\u2019t think of anything that beats this.  Start looking at the quality of the competition instead, and you\u2019ll often find that the market is saturated with a LOT of bad players, and they\u2019re making a LOT of money despite being so bad.** This is the perfect situation.   \n \n**Business plans:** This often ends up being a way to push action further down the road.  If It\u2019s longer than one page you\u2019re wasting your time.  [Download something like this](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf), fill that bad boy out, and get to work.\n \n**LLC/incorporation:** Unless the company can pay for it, it\u2019s not happening.  So this only happens AFTER the company is making money.  One more excuse...GONE!\n \n**Business Analysis:** Demographic data, market analysis, the economic outlook... blah blah blah. More ways to kick the can down the road and to feel that you\u2019re doing something when you\u2019re really not.  I just get to work. If a lot of people are making money doing this thing, the startup cost is low, and there is no sorcery involved, it can be done!\n \n**Fear of your idea being stolen:** Ideas hold little intrinsic value without execution. However, you can start to extract value when you get feedback on it, massaging it, push and poke it, and really run it through the wringer.  And the only way to do this is to tell people about it.  This goes against our most basic instincts because we\u2019re fearful that our ideas might be stolen.  Well the reality is, most people are sitting on the bench with a gazillion ideas of their own that they are not executing on.  You just added one more to that list.  Either way, if an idea cannot survive competition it\u2019s probably not that good in the first place.  In addition, what happens when you launch?  You can\u2019t run a business without telling anybody about it.   You\u2019ll often get this response, \u201c But I\u2019ll lose my first-mover\u2019s advantage?\u201d. Well good.  I would never want to be the first mover anyhow.  First movers bare a tremendous cost in educating customers.  Most of us don\u2019t have the money to bare that cost.  The folks that are second and onwards, can just slide in and benefit from all of that work.  For example, I don\u2019t have to explain the concept of a subscription box service sending you shaving equipment every month.  Most people already know what this is, thanks to Dollar Shave Club.  Bottom line: Try to get over this stuff.\n \n**Find something you\u2019re passionate about:**  Nah son.  Find something that is viable.  I\u2019m passionate about table tennis, but I\u2019m not looking to turn that passion into a business.  When it comes to business, I\u2019m far more passionate about providing a good product/service that has good margins, than about being able to marry that business to any hobby or other exciting pursuit I may have in my regular life.   This way, I\u2019m free to work on the best opportunity that arises without limitation.  And honestly, quite often the least sexy industries are where the big money is being made.  So while most of the brainpower is busy chasing sexy mobile apps and such, you can make bank by selling ugly widgets or providing basic services.  It\u2019s tough to pay bills with app downloads.\n \n**A note to Engineers and consultants:** Resist the urge to complicate things.  For technical folks, it seems like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming.  So a problem like \u201cfind people that need lawn service and connect them with people that provide lawn service\u201d becomes, \u201cwell how about we use Zillow\u2019s APi to pull a picture of the lawn, and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the area to be serviced and we tie that into Google maps and feed everything into a pricing algorithm\u201d.... and on and on.  Unfortunately, many of these guys do not make it.  More often than not simplicity wins.  Get out of the customer\u2019s way.\n \n**Start something small to get practice:**  You don\u2019t get good at running marathons by reading about running marathons.  And you don\u2019t get good at business by reading about business.  You get good by doing. And doing it over and over again.  But just like you wouldn\u2019t expect to win the first marathon you entered, why put so much pressure on yourself to win at the first company you start?   Or worse yet, paralyze yourself with fear into never running at all because you\u2019re afraid you won\u2019t win? It doesn\u2019t make sense with marathons and it doesn\u2019t make sense with business.  So while a lot of folks over-analyze every minutia about the thing, people like Kevin and me would have already downloaded a training regiment, bought a pair of shoes, and hit the bricks.\n \n**What if I fail?** Nothing happens!  It\u2019s literally the most mundane non-event imaginable.  I spend a day or two wrapping up any loose ends, head to the movies or do something fun, and by the next day I\u2019m already figuring out what the next thing is.  My personal experience hasn\u2019t been \u201cTry-&gt;Win\u201d, it has been more like \u201ctry, fail, try, fail, try, fail, try, fail win, win, win, win.\u201d   With each failure you get better, and then things just start to come easy.  Don\u2019t be afraid of failing, it\u2019s like the best and cheapest MBA you\u2019ll ever get.  \n \n**Naysayers:** If you\u2019re doing something...I mean anything, you\u2019ll meet them.  Whether it\u2019s in real life, on the Internet, or wherever else.  Sometimes it\u2019s even your friends and family.  I keep an imgur album of the best ones I come across.   Sometimes for a little motivation, and sometimes just to look back and smile.    For example, recently I mentioned in passing that my next big project will be a restaurant, and I already have a list of comment screenshots explaining why I won\u2019t succeed.  :-)\n \nHere\u2019s [one of my favorite ones](http://i.imgur.com/UNNyS0F.png) from a few years back when I was making $4k per month, from what was a new company at the time.  This was the top comment on Hacker News.\n \nThat little company now pays me a 6 figure salary.  What intrigued me about this comment was the fact that it was so thoughtfully written.  This wasn\u2019t a troll.  This was someone that provided a seemingly well-reasoned analysis of where he thought I would be in 12 months, complete with business school type analysis: barriers to entry, competitive landscape, etc.   \n \nSo why is this important?  Because **this is exactly what many of us do to ourselves.**\n \nWe have a naysayer living permanently inside our heads that is constantly appraising and analyzing every business idea we entertain.  And the analysis sounds just as reasoned, and well thought-out and measured as the one I posted above.  Not a bad thing on its face, but **the guy in our head typically skews negative.** Shut that dude up! Or you\u2019ll analyze and over think and what-if every single idea until you convince yourself it won\u2019t work.  Over time this messes with your confidence, and you end up paralyzed.  Say what you want about the guy, but Kanye was right about this: [Most people are held back by their perception of themselves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3X4r-eCYQ&amp;t=6m59s)  It\u2019s a brutal feedback loop.\n \nAt some point we have to just say \u201cFuck It\u201d and get to work!\n \nOkay peeps, hope this was helpful to at least one person.  [Oh, and for making it this far even if you skimmed\u2026:-\\)](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Barney-Stinson-Requests-The-Highest-Of-Fives-On-How-I-Met-Your-Mother.gif)\n \nAMA\n\nEdited to add our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groovelearning/) where we continue this and other business discussions: \n\nAnd [where you can download this in PDF form](http://www.rohangilkes.com/free-guides/) (along with other writings of mine).\n\nAnd my [twitter page](https://twitter.com/).\n\n\n\n",

I've been wet shaving with a couple Merkur razors and the Japanese Feather blades for years now with Truefitt &amp; Hill soap and pre-shave oil.  I'm not a big shaving geek, but I'd say I have a pretty decent/higher-end setup that most.  That said, when I started, I tried a couple blades and soaps and arrived on what I liked.  Once I found those though, I bought a large soap thing, and a 100 pack of blades for dirt cheap.  This supply has lasted me over a year shaving twice a week and using each blade twice.  How much supply do people actually receive every month? How much leftover do they typically end up with?\n\n2. Your price point seems really steep for someone who has decided that wet shaving is for them and buys blades in bulk and a large container of soap.  How do you address this?\n\n3. How are you improving things based on the lukewarm (at best) reception over at Badger &amp; Blade? [This post](http://badgerandblade.com/vb/showthread.php/404051-Wet-Shave-Club-Info-Update) seems cautiously optimistic in terms of people's response, but it is acknowledged that you are targeting new shavers, not experienced ones.  [Your review page isn't as flattering](http://badgerandblade.com/reviews/showproduct.php?product=211365), and it claims the value of the products provided is not worth the cost of the service.\n4. What's your churn like?  I'm guessing you haven't seen annual churn rates yet, but be cautious about banking on the anticipated revenue from them--you will likely experience a large drop in renewals after that first year.\n5. Once CrateJoy and the inevitable competitors all trying to sell shovels during the goldrush come out of beta, how will you deal with the anticipated competition for what are largely commodity products that will soon have the barrier to entry significantly lowered?",

It's more of a curation service although our boxes retail for more then members pay for them.\n\n3) It's impossible to have every single customer happy.

That said, your product inherently helps people try different samples and such.  Once they find something they like, there doesn't seem to be much incentive to keep with your service vs. just buying a bunch of whatever they like and using that for much less money.  I know you are looking at an ecomm shop which is a really smart move.  I'm more focused on the fact that there doesn't seem to be much lock-in per se.\n\nOnce CrateJoy brings in the inevitable hordes of people looking to start a simple subscription box service, you will inevitably have more competition.  That's great if you don't fear them, but realistically it will increase your Customer Acquisition Costs and likely impact your margins.  It happens every time a service comes out that significantly lowers the barrier to entry in a particular type of business.  Do you not see that as a potential risk?",

            "comment": "Seriously congratulations! Your post was amazing and easy to read. I tried earlier this year an online project by myself and it was a failure that I abandoned at the end of summer unfortunately.. I'm thinking if I want to try my next adventure (I'm already thinking about it) I will need to find a partner, thing is I live in Europe in a non-English country and I find myself surrounded by friends who don't have a vision like me and would rather work at a company.. \n\nAnyways, I wanted to say this post gave me motivation and pumped me! I have few questions tho if you don't mind:\n\n1. What was your area of expertise before buying the company, what you know would be a strength for the business, what did you think was your weakness?\n2.  What did you exactly look for in your partner?\n3. Overall to launch the business you needed the 15k Kabbage, at the early development and before Kabbage what was your financial investment?\n4. Anything worth interesting to share during your 5 months working before the launch? Did you predicted how long it was going to take to launch your new version or did you just go day by day\n5. Financially how did you budget everything, was it well thought how much you were going to invest on something before, or did you just put the money where it was needed every-time you had a new obstacle?\n6. Something I find difficult is to outsource stuff, I see you use a lot of third parties, would you mind elaborating a little bit about this?\n\nAgain thanks for this awesome post, I wish you guys only success and to achieve new goals and higher numbers :)",

To answer your questions:\n\n&gt;What was your area of expertise before buying the company, what you know would be a strength for the business, what did you think was your weakness?\n\nThis is going to be a weird answer man, so bare with me.  My area of expertise is doing the thing.  I think it's a skill in itself to take an idea, skip the over-thinking part, and figuring out how to pull it off.  That's what I'm good at.  So if someone were to say \"Hey,I'll pay you $20,000 if you can catch a wild buffalo and deliver it to me alive in Manhattan in 2 weeks\", I'd figure that shit out and post a picture of me walking a wild buffalo down 5th Ave two weeks from now :-)  That's my real area of expertise.  \n\n&gt;What did you exactly look for in your partner?  \n  \nMy weakness is social media, and /u/kaster is a God on Instagram and Facebook.  So it was a no-brainer to work with him.  Plus I look for people that want to take risks and give things a shot. I could never work with someone who takes too much time second guessing everything.  Most people would not have dropped everything and driven across the country to life and work with someone they had never met to take a shot at something.  And this is exactly the type of people I want to work with. \n\n&gt;Overall to launch the business you needed the 15k Kabbage, at the early development and before Kabbage what was your financial investment?  \n\n$4K for the site, and $500 for seller to help us out with the transition a bit.  Before Kabbage Kevin and I put in another $4k or so of our own money.  \n\n&gt;Anything worth interesting to share during your 5 months working before the launch? Did you predicted how long it was going to take to launch your new version or did you just go day by day  \n\nWe just went day by day, had no idea when things would really pan out.  \n\n&gt;Financially how did you budget everything, was it well thought how much you were going to invest on something before, or did you just put the money where it was needed every-time you had a new obstacle?  \n\nWe just put the money where it was needed.  Like we changed our box fill several times, and had to throw out the old fill we bought.  Stuff like that there is no planning for.  \n\n&gt;Something I find difficult is to outsource stuff, I see you use a lot of third parties, would you mind elaborating a little bit about this?  \n\nMy favorite question of the bunch:  I'm of the mindset where I only focus on the things I am best at. Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING else I find someone who is better at that thing than myself.  So coding, design, inventory, etc. I'm not good at, so I look for folks who are better and let go.  This is the only way you'll make it man.  \n\nThanks for the awesome questions and appreciate the nice words as well.",

The strength you need is work ethic. We go to sleep when we pass out from exhaustion. \n\n2) Someone that is no BS. Rohan gets stuff done before you even know he's done with it. Epic person to work with.\n\n3) 4k for the business, and a few more for design and coding work.\n\n4) There was no 5 months to launch. We started the business and had new members the first day we owned the business.\n\n5) Rohan is the numbers guy. He is very precise on budgeting, and figuring out projects, and where costs need to be today.\n\n6) Can you elaborate on what you mean specifically? I love outsourcing all I can.",

For starters, if you are using AdWords conversion data, it is already by default giving 100% assisted conversion credit even if someone later converted through another channel like social, organic, email, etc.  Arguably, those channels should probably get some credit for the conversion too no?  And then even within AdWords there is likely contributing factors to account for.  Their Search Funnel report gives a good glance at this as you'll likely see Brand campaigns snapping up conversions, but Non-brand campaigns being strong prospectors.\n\nAgain, if you have a solution and a background in cross-channel attribution, I'd love to hear it.  Unfortunately though there are many services that try to simplify it for people that aren't data geeks like myself, and it's just one of those things that doesn't simplify well in terms of actual actionable data. Like, I can explain the stock market to someone at a very high level in terms of \"buy low, sell high\" but that doesn't give them enough info to actually be a trader.",

    "postText": "Reddit friends, stalkers, and non hostile neckbeards,  \n\n\nI recently interviewed Marshall Terrin in my business magazine, SHIFT. He left the US Marines and started a business empire. Had a 7 figure business by 25. He started off with mall kiosks and then a series of oxygen bars. He became an angel investor and took ownership of a 16k member veteran FB group. Great guy and mentor. Here are some of the things that I have learned from him. \n\n1. The numbers are important. Learn how to review your analytics monthly to chart growth and remember that you should be checking views, sales, and likes. See what events create upticks and which times of day get the most engagement.\n2. Choosing your team members is a crucial skillset because they are the key performance of your company when you aren't around. Look for highly driven innovators and create incentives so they feel ownership. \n3. Personal development should be practiced by all entrepreneurs. Hire a coach, do some type of fitness, make sure you are being social a few times a week and have a definitive plan for growth.\n4. If you are doing retail, location and foot traffic are everything. Pay attention to what's going on nearby and what things affect the amount of potential shoppers to your location. \n5. Creating family balance is vital to happiness. Don't become a workaholic at the expense of your relationships. There will always be more work.   \n\n\nHope this helps, enjoy your Monday everyone! - Rob",

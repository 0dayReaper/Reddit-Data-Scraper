I totally agree.\n\nPeople love dramatic stories and that \"something unnormal\" must be happened to them.\n\nWhen in fact it's boring \"I just endured the pain, did a lot of mistakes and learned as much as possible\".\n\nI remember when we had a random team meet up in the city, we talked about our past and our visions in the future. We all were extremely open up and honest to each other.\n\nMy mentor was telling his story about how he made 100k debts, then after having a deep depressional phase, he went to a seminar, got motivation pumped up and closed for 25k coaching. On his way back home he realized what he did and was about to fall in panic, when he remembered one of many quotes \"Successful people do fast decisions and trust those decisions\" in combination with \"Successful people are looking for solutions, not for excuses\". So instead of say \"I don't have the money\", he went crazy in his family and friendhood, asked for loans and later on got the money, because his sister was working at the bank.\n\nThe next year(s) he literally worked his ass off and went through a lot of pain.\n\nWhen he finished his 9-15 routine, he started his next 9-15 routine, since he wanted to become the #1 in the company and learn so much that he never has to do something again.\n\nHe did tons of mistakes and I mean TONS of mistakes.\n\nAnd thats it. This is one of the most \"magical\" things you will hear from becoming successful.\n\nJust do as many \"non critical\" mistakes as possible, learn from them, grow and become better everyday. 1% each day will be an improvement of 365% in a year.\n\nHe then learned the value of coachings, invested 100k to get more coachings and now has it's own very successful coaching business with multiple million Euro revenue. And the doesn't even do advertising or similar. The full sales is done by the customers who want to practise the learnings from the course and earn money on the way.\n\nYea, some parts sound like a Disney Movie, too cool to be true, while others sound like \"Yea, but there must be more around it, right?\".\n\nIn end,.. No.\n\nIt's just:\n\n\\- Just do it\n\n\\- Do mistakes\n\n\\- Learn from them\n\n\\- Invest in getting teached by people who already learned it and reduce the amount of time and mistakes you have to take by multiple years\n\n\\- Implement\n\n\\- Repeat",

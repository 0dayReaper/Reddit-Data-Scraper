I can put up to $200k down (10% is required and the remaining 90% through SBA loan).\n\n   \nI'd like to grow it to the point where I can eventually step away and have an operator run it. Would also like to have some balance so I can spend time with my wife and two young kids (2.5 and 3 months). For example, driveway sealing.  \n\n\nWhat are the best cash flowing businesses I could buy?",

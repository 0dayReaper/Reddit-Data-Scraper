    "postText": "My short summary is that I fell in love with 360 degree video and VR and started recording VR travel videos and putting them on Youtube as a hobby learning the video skills as I go and maybe I'd get some adsense money out of it to finance future travels but not there yet.\n\nThen big businesses dropped their VR interest, Covovid19 hit and my camera lens got scratched so I stopped.\n\n Now I saw [the new Apple VR/AR headset presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btf4mN37OsU) and it has reignited my interest.\n\nI believe the VR earnings potential is huge in a decade or so but as its a fairly new industry I have trouble envisioning a way today to monetize my VR hobby and would love for experienced entrepreneurs to share their advice and possibly show me what steps to be taking.\n\n[My VR 360 travel youtube for reference](https://www.youtube.com/@360ODYSY/videos)",

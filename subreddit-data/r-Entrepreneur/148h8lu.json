    "postText": "Day 26  \n\n\nHello, for the previous 26 days I've been working in developing an idea. I've done the business model, market research and a few connections.   \n\n\nWe're talking in a real state co-investment platform. A platform where every person can invest, even if they don't have enough money to buy the complete house.  \n\n\nWhat do I have so far?   \n\n\nA complete business model  \nA market research made to 27 different companies (4 construction companies and 23 real state) and 650 persons.  \nNetwork - We have 13 companies that agree in putting they're properties in the platform and 14 willing to. - PS : companies from Portugal, Spain, France and Germany  \n\n\nNext steps:  \nIncrease the team: \n\n  \nLooking for co-founders\n\n1. Web Developer - 15% equity\n2. Marketing / Design - 15% equity\n3. Comercial - 15% equity\n\nAdvisory Board\n\n1. Lawyer - Better if it is a European law expert\n2. German Manager\n3. France Manager\n4. Spain Manager\n5. Real State Expert\n\nIf you're interested or know someone who can be, send me a DM :)\n\nI'll do a new post with update in another 25 days.  \n",

    "postText": "It's been almost 3 years since I gave my last update. Quick pitch: I founded a [UI/UX design](https://fairpixels.pro/?en) subscription service tailored to B2B software startups. This was years ago. \n\nWe're at a point where I could only dream of when I just got started. For many entrepreneurs in this sub, sharing where we are right now might be motivational/inspirational, but it'll probably be not very useful and actionable.\n\nI remember reading many inspirational stories with incredible MRR and ARR milestones. None of those posts were really helpful. they would give you a nice little boost, but for someone just starting out had zero tactical advice in them.\n\nFor that reason, I wanted to break down how I got started through just a handful of bullet points. Each one can easily be translated to what ever it is that you want to start. It's motivating in the sense that I've walked this path, it required no money just effort.\n\nBut hopefully it's mostly actionable and practical for the next entrepreneur to start something big. \n\nHere goes!\n\n---\n\n* The first client -- No website, just one email: I didn't launch my business with a website. No social media channel, nothing. What I did was contact someone I had worked with before via email, and pitching him the UI/UX design subscription service I thought about launching. He asked for a payment link and I was in business. Who can in your past contacts can you email or call right now, and pitch them your business idea? Not to get feedback or advice, but to get them onboard as a customer.\n\n* The first few customers -- No website still, just a few more emails: I repeated what worked to get my first client. I asked a few more people I knew if they were interested. Some said no, some didn't reply, others said yes. Now not only would I ask the folks I knew, I would ask the folks that said yes (and those who said no) if they knew people that would be interested. This is how I started getting more customers into the business. All by myself, no website, no dollar spent on ads, nothing. Just a free gmail account. If you catch only one fish with that first step, don't start doing stupid things. Just repeat what works.\n\n* Ok ok.. a website: so after I made a website, the only thing it really did was make it easier to gain credibility with folks that didn't directly or indirectly know me. I was still by myself at this point, but work was piling up, so would also need the website to start hiring designers. The website would be the first step to start scaling outside my circles and grow a team. By now, I had already talked to my customers, worked with them, gotten paid so the offering evolved into something that I was confident about. The website just naturally evolved from those conversations. Don't start with websites, business cards and all those wantrepreneurial things. In almost all cases, these are never step one for you to take.\n\n* Marketing -- your saw dust attracts your best clients: I can't remember where I read this, but I found this sawdust analogy to be true. By far the best 'marketing tactic' we've had was to share publicly what ever we would build. Wether it was work we did for startups, redesigning their product and packaging it as a case study. Or what worked even better: give away free stuff that we ended up making anyway and didn't want to just keep for ourselves. (by now the team grew beyond myself, so the saw dust started compounding). We would share unused designs for free, or tools and processes that we would build for ourselves. All of these things tapped into our skillset and we just put it out there to maximise exposure. Make a list of all the things that you are producing anyway. It may be trash to you, but it could very well be the thing that attracts wonderful customers to your business. This could even be knowledge that you gain. Share it publicly. Or even better: learn in public and share what you learn. There are things being created in your brain or in the physical world, that you may see as a side effect of your efforts. But they have the potential to be the magnets of your business.\n\n--\n\nI hope this was useful. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments or DM.",

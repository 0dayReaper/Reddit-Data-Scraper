Having separate pages is also helpful for search suggestions and queries.\n\nSemantically, the website is not so good. You have your main content wrapped in one section tag. You used a div instead of a header tag. There are likely more missing semantics that will affect where you rank and how accessible your site is to crawlers.\n\nEdit: Also the site is not fully-responsive; your contact form is not easy to use on mobile devices. Overall, it is pretty good.",

It's good to be mindful of how we communicate our messages specific to our audiences. \n\nSome details are not communicated well like in the list for Search engineering. In you first bullet, there's a claim, but is not substantiated with an example or explanation on how the implementation is scalable, reliable and secure. It would be beneficial to have a call-to-action at the end of your services section for curious visitors. The service section would look great as a row of cards (think icon followed by header followed by text as seen in envanto web templates) and makes it easier to digest what is being read.\n\nYou'll want to include a call-to-action at the top as well for your meetings. This way, your visitors don't have to slog to the end of a page for a meeting.\n\nI have more to add but I need to prepare a meal!",

That means we'll have to display what it is we do to them in seconds! Another comment in the thread mentioned that it is too wordy. It appears that way, so when initially viewing the page keep the most descriptive text in sight about your consultations. Like 1-2 key sentences.\n\nIf you have testimonials, reviews or any feedback, it is incredibly helpful to include them in your site. This is assurance and votes of confidence by people who have worked with you. It is best seen near the bottom of the site and is worth having a web page for itself for querying purposes.",

Honestly, if your team has the data science, engineering and analytic expertise but you can't get someone to make you a professional website I will just not look at it. I mean you are targeting tech and while I am in biotech  I would just not take you seriously with a blog like website. It just looks unprofessional.  I would suggest you build a website with multiple pages. Also \"With a wealth of experience, we possess a deep understanding\" well you don't give me a single example of what is a result of all of this wealth of experience.  Please add more domain knowledge information because it sounds a bit like chatGPT wrote it.  Also propose some basic pipelines so that the customer can find themselves ( and be like yeah that sounds like something I need). You mention that well we work with elastic ... but again the costumer has no clue what that is (this is why they hire you to explain all of this) but a costumer can find themselves in description of a problem that you provide a basic pipeline on your website. This both makes other costumers visit you website (to steal your easy idea) but also some of them may stop and be like (yeah maybe we should hire them for more advanced shit).  \n\n\nNo hard feelings!",

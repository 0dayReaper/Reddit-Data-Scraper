There is no reason you can't make as much as someone in the states. Identify the higher paid VAs and study what they are doing and how they are doing it. Reach out to them with specific questions after you have figured out what you can from studying upwork, reddit, and other sites. Best of luck, you got this!",

It is easier for survey participants to select options instead of writing questions to your answers.\n\nMake it easier for people to help you. \n\nMoreover, instead of building your VA business around market demand, build it around your own skills.  Identify your skills. Then identify the market that needs your skills",

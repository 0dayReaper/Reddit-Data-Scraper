    "postText": "Hi there,  \n\n\nI have begun the process of starting a business that looks after people's recycling bins. On each council bin collection day I will move the bins to the side of the road and return them once they've been emptied, and offer a deep clean on top of that.  \n\n\nI built a landing page website with a basic form to register interest, and decided to go door to door in my neighbourhood to gauge interest before taking it further.  \n\n\nHere are the stats:  \n\n\n* I am based in the UK\n* I went door-to-door at 12:00-13:45 on a Friday\n* I was in a middle class neighbourhood with mostly families and detached/semidetached homes.\n* Of the 42 homes that answered:\n   * 3 said they'd be interested (7%),\n   * 5 said maybe (12%)\n   * Of those yes' and maybe's, 2 visited my website (5%)\n   * Neither of those 2 registered interest\n   * 34 said no\n   * About 50% of homes were happy to hear me out before giving an answer.\n   * 5 already had their bins cleaned by someone, but 0 had them moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo my surprise, the larger houses with bigger gardens were more likely to say no or not interested than the smaller semidetached homes with much shorter distances to move the bins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my very first time trying something like this. I was hoping for some insight into these numbers to understand if this is what I can expect, if it is worth pursuing, etc. I understand it is a small sample size in a single neighbourhood. What are your thoughts on these results?",

Take into consideration weather/ time of year to help figure when the bins will be needing a cleaning the most. \n\nHearing that they were happy to hear you out is important. It shows you have SOMETHING personable that make them interested in listening. Maybe focus on your pitch a little before finding a new neighborhood. Don\u2019t forget the service is only half the sale, you have to sell yourself too! Good luck!",

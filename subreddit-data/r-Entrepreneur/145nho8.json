Also their humor is a little weird, but when I was in my early 20s, I bet all of my savings on an app idea and drove it into the ground doing what the uber-wealthy claimed to have done. I took big financial risks, preserved equity at all costs, pulled away from my day job, yada yada. Anyway, hopefully it helps someone on here who\u2019s starting from nothing and looking for what not to do. The podcast is called Profiteers vs. the People.",

Some keep going until they hit the center bullseye, then they give speeches or write blog posts about \"meritocracy\" and the salutary effects of hard work.\n\nPoor kids aren't visiting the carnival.

It was fun thinking back on the experience :)\n\nIf you\u2019re building an app and trying to stay cheap, the conventional approach is to go over seas, but computer science internships in the US can often just be getting the coffee and donuts, so I hired 2 local Sr devs and then brought on 3 paid interns from a local university for $15 per hour. They were all thrilled and motivated, got hands on experience, learned a ton and did damn good work. \n\nSummary: Have faith in young people and pay them as well as you can. They are wonderful for workplace culture and seem to have all the good ideas.\n\nI felt like an idiot at one point during production because I was spending $2k per week paying everyone and that felt insane. Less than a year later, my No2 guy (one of the Sr Devs) decided to take a stab at his own start up and was brilliantly methodical. I admired and cheered from the sidelines and he eventually brought me on to help with the UX. Even though he was using overseas devs, his workflow management approach was brilliant and felt far more efficient than mine, which seemed to prove my fears from my time running the show. \nAfter a few months, my day job picked up and I had to take a brief step back. 2 months later, I found out that he had to hit pause on development, because despite his brilliance, methodical approach, and far superior knowledge base, development was costing him over $2k a week as well\n\nSummary: everyone feels like an idiot when they are starting their first business. Also, as a rule of thumb, it seems that $2k per week was just what people wound up spending while developing an app (this was a few years ago so things may be different)\n\nSomething I wish I\u2019d done differently:\nEven though the idea failed, I wish I had given my team equity along with what I was paying them. \nOne of my Sr devs got stumped on something one week and couldn\u2019t deliver in time. He knew that money was getting tight and insisted I not pay him for the week. I should have given him a chunk of the company right there. I was really proud of what we built and I couldn\u2019t have done it without them. \n\nI should have saved more of a nest egg beforehand. I didn\u2019t know how many of these app guys got started with family money. Building your first app will probably take a year if you don\u2019t have incredible mentors, save accordingly.\n\nAlso, move all of the company\u2019s assets to a C corp just before launch. There\u2019s some tax thing that makes it so that if the company sells a year after the C-Corp is registered, the first $10m in proceeds is tax free (please fact check me on this, I might not have it exactly right. Also, for the love of god, talk to an accountant)\n\nThe company fell apart very shortly after launch which sucked. I checked back months later and saw that someone had found the app and had used it to facilitate a real estate transaction (which is what it was designed to do). Small victory but pretty amazing feeling.",

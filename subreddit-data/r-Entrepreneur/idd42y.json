I did a few local events (think festivals and those little vendor events that highlight local businesses like Home and Garden sjows). This put ME as the front and centre sales person to promote my business.  \nI also offered free samples by delivery ONLY (ie while I had takeaway items from the booth, they needed to actually give me an address for a free sample, which kept the freebies to those serious enough to really try it). My return rate on samples is about 80-90 percent buy in for monthly deliveries for at least 6 months. This isnt a subscription concept, more like the milk man where you pay for what you really need and can cancel anytime. \n\nAfter the first couple years, I was finding the occasional flyer drop to be completely useless and that most of my new customers met me somewhere (I wear branded shirts a LOT) or heard about us from another customer. I'd say 90 percent of our new business comes from referrals, and some of that is topped up by the ONE fair we still do (it's a country fair where people who like local tend to go) \n\nI certainly have social media, and our brand is on our containers that sit often in peoples kitchens, but I havent paid for anything beyond our fair fees in several years and yet we have a solid growth ongoing. I do attribute some of this to just doing what we do consistently and with integrity",

Compared to software, hardware/consumer goods has much longer iteration cycles (takes time to design, integrate, prototype, market test due to all the manufacturing steps involved). Plus, developing prototypes to do market tests is a pretty big commitment - it can cost several thousand dollars and 6 weeks to produce a mere 5 or 10 units, even with garage manufacturing plastic housings on a 3D printer. So its pretty hard to do AB testing. So you better hope you put those 10 units in good hands to give you adequate feedback.\n\nThen, lets say you're happy and want to move forward with manufacturing. The mold for your plastics will typically cost 50k+ USD, which you have to shell out upfront, plus parts for your PCB can cost tens of grand. Then there's the contract manufacturer/assembler which won't work with you unless you commit to building several hundred units. Finally, there's distribution. If you're trying to stock your product in Home Depot or Wall Mart, there are strict packaging and delivery criteria that can be very difficult to meet. So you usually need to shell out another couple thousand to meet those criteria and get the product delivered to the stores you want within the alloted window.\n\nSo now you've spent nearly 100k USD on a product that has only been in the hands of a few dozen people, so while your marketing team may have confidence in the product, it hasn't been tested thoroughly because it's impossible to guess how idiotically consumers will attempt to use and therefor break your product. If something does go wrong, most big box retailers expect you to foot the bill for unsold items on their shelves. God forbid you need to do a recall, its way more expensive to reverse the supply chain funnel to get product back from the customers and off the shelves of the stores then it was to distribute it in the first place.\n\nThats why I say hardware/consumer goods are a slog. The overhead and relatively long lead times can be a nightmare to deal with. There's a reason the rule of thumb is that a hardware/consumer product needs to sell for 4x its manufacturing cost - otherwise the whole venture is just untenable.\n\nEdit: so if you have an established company or very successful fundraising rounds, then you can jump into bulk manufacturing earlier to take advantage of economics of scale, making the development process cheaper in the long run. Trying to operate out of your garage though is a whole different story. It can often take thousands of dollars just to validate an idea in hardware costs alone. It can be a huge risk, especially compared with software, where all you're really risking is a few weeks worth of time and effort in order to get to the point where you can validate an idea.",

They're valuable too, but I tend to learn better from actual stories with specific issues, and I think most people learn better that way.\n\nYou can just browse pg. 1 of this subreddit. I don't mean to offend, but it's people who sold their first 100 packages and want affirmation, or talking about Uber's business model. Once again, not saying it's not valuable, but these are such rare cases, and the failure rate for \"innovative\" businesses are so high, to me... these aren't very valuable topics to be talking about in a forum with presumably non-billionaires lol. I'm always a bit annoyed when people talk about wealth inequality or the rich, and seemingly every fuck'n reddit thread about this very important topic focuses on Jeff Bezos or other billionaire as if they weren't the biggest statistical outliers you can imagine.\n\nAnd there was a thread just yesterday, not sure if it was here or in /r/smallbusiness, but it had to do with an owner of a 4-person firm, where 2 quit, 1 after using up his/her 2 weeks of medical leave citing Covid concerns. I thought the poster was very self-aware, humble, and admitted some faults on her part. Even the thread title was that she just wanted some \"hugs.\" **Spoiler**: It eventually ends with a significant # of people who know nothing about her telling her that she was probably a terrible leader.\n\nI try to be humble myself, but in the few reddit posts re: small business or entrepreneurship, if you're making a lot of money, you're a tyrant, if you're experiencing losses, you're an idiot, if you're overworked, \"just delegate bro, it's easy.\" I'm not paraphrasing, that's an actual quote, including the \"it's easy\" part.\n\nI think there are issues with a subreddit just called entrepreneurship. It goes back to the criticism of people who even call themselves entrepreneurs at all. It's a very general term, probably too general.",

Since April I'm on my second box of 1000 envelopes!\n\nPut it this way - I can buy 2400 sunflower seeds that are popular on ebay for \u00a39 and sell 10 yes ten for 2.25 minus \u00a3.65 for postage and some fees. But I think that's a fair return on an investment of \u00a39.\nAnd I have 43 listings of lots of different seeds types, so I'm pretty busy packing them up before and after work. Oh, and I became a power seller which helps with paying 10% less fee's I think\n\nIt's not huge money but it certainly helps!\n\nI also want to start some kind of vegeterian/vegan supermarket but that's way out of my league unfortunately.\n\nI have a strong suspicion a noodle bar would do well in my town because there isn't one here.\n\nI also want to start a tool hire place because there is only one palce that does it and I could just undercut them but again, I have no idea how to start that up.\n\nThere are a bunch of small car garage/repair/mot places around here but not one big fuck off shiny and bright centre to take cars to and I think that would put the smaller guys out of business. And this is a well populated area with over 10's of thousands of homes going up recently in a commuter town for London. The town also received 'Garden Town' status from the gov so we get investment money from them which means the place is definitely growing. So, lots of cars!!\n\nI have idea's but implementation and making it work without crumbling around me is not something I know how to do BUT I fucking hate being poor so I look on these sub reddits about business and maybe something will click and it'll work out.\n\nTo misquote you - I for one would love to hear about anyone's stories related to businesses I've mentioned and how the hell you make things happeni",

Your users get the benefit of ChatGPT without having to leave your app. \n\nAnd a BUNCH of people are building apps like this and presumably making money doing it. I haven\u2019t looked into it but I believe you can even use a no-code app builder like Glide to build an app and just connect the API key to integrate it. \n\nIf you want an idea of the kinds of apps people are making with this, there\u2019s a guy on LinkedIn/Twitter who runs an AI newsletter in which he does roundups of new AI apps/tools. I think his name is Zain Kahn (not sure about that spelling?). \n\n(Incidentally, his business might be an interesting one to do a case study on\u2014his subscriber list is growing crazy fast because everyone is afraid of missing the boat on AI and the newsletter gives you a sense of the possibilities/capabilities, and he runs sponsored ads in the newsletter, so if he\u2019s not already raking in cash, he will be soon.)",

            "comment": "Thanks @OP, I love this kind of content. Keep it up!\n\nIn the spirit of providing value for free, here are a couple of tips/feedback points. Take it on board or totally disregard at your discretion:\n\n1.  If you want to earn subscribers with this type of post, make sure your content is as close to error-free as possible. Reread before posting, twice. Then read it again, aloud.\n\nE.g. Is it Jiggy Puzzles or JiffyPuzzles? Be consistent.\n\nEven things like inconsistent spacing/formatting, inconsistent use of plurals, sentence fragments will deter readers like me from subscribing. The occasional typo is fine but repeated errors come across as careless. This applies to comments too. \n\nIf you can\u2019t hire an English first-language proofreader/editor, use something like Grammarly or ChatGPT or something to proofread your content and fix any spelling and grammar issues. \n\nGrammarly\u2019s paid product is AMAZING but even the free extension is great at pointing out errors in online content before you post it. \n\n\n2.  Information is good but analysis is better. To provide real value, don\u2019t just give a summary; give readers actionable takeaways. \n\nDig a little deeper. Figure out why it works, or what makes it interesting, or what it means. YOUR takeaway/theory/analysis is what makes subscribing to your newsletter worth it. Bonus points if you develop a theory and do further research and find data that backs up your hunch. \n\nFor an example of what I mean, check out the way Axios structures their newsletters. They keep it short and sweet but they use subheadings/bold text to ask questions like \u201cwhat it means\u201d and \u201c why it matters\u201d before giving a brief analysis of the news item that answer the reader\u2019s unspoken \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n3.  Avoid leaving questions unanswered in your content. \n\nWhat do I mean by that? \n\nDon\u2019t give only half the information and leave readers wondering about the rest (or clicking away to go read more somewhere else).\n\nFor example, as someone interested in the plants industry, Fastgrowing Trees got my attention, but I immediately wondered \u201cIn which market do they operate?\u201d because I wanted to know whether this business model would work equally well where I am, or whether its success comes down to a specific location\u2019s market conditions. \n\nTo address this, I\u2019d recommend making sure your content answers as many of the key \u201cjournalistic\u201d questions (what, who, where, when, why, how) as possible. I.e.:\n\n- WHAT is the business called? What does it do? What need does it serve? \n\n- WHO is involved? \n\nMention the founder(s), plus people like notable investors or interesting comments by experts (anything that makes it more interesting). \n\nBonus points if there\u2019s a good story that makes them relatable, like why they started the business or how they had an epiphany, or which challenges they had to overcome (e.g. read Canva\u2019s founders\u2019 story - it\u2019s super inspiring)\n\n- WHERE is it based? \n\n- At minimum, mention which city it\u2019s headquartered/based in (+country, if it\u2019s relevant or not a city that\u2019s super well-known/universally recognizable) \n- Which market(s) does it operate in (city? State? Country?)\n- Does it only serve local customers, or\u2026?\n- If it\u2019s a physical product, does it ship internationally too?\n\n- WHEN did it succeed? \n\n- Which year did the business launch? \n- Is it\u2019s success recent? What\u2019s the timeline?\n- Did the business take years to become profitable, or was it an overnight success?\n\n(Here\u2019s where the analysis part is crucial - you do this to some extent in the last two examples, but you could go a lot deeper if you really want to provide value. I know this is just a quick Reddit post, but if you want to drive subscribers, you want to give as much as you can to demonstrate what value your newsletter offers). \n\n- WHY is it successful?\n\nWhat sets it apart from its competitors? Which factors contributed to its success? What made the founder(s) choose this industry/product/service? Did anything change to lead to this success? \n\n- HOW did this business succeed? \n\n(\u2014and, critically, how can your readers apply this information to their own businesses to achieve similar success?)\n\nHere are some ideas that spring to mind:\n\n- Did they bootstrap the business, or get massive investments through fundraising?\n\n- Which revenue model(s) do they use? Ad sales? Product/service? Subscription? Freemium? What is their pricing structure?\n\n- What do their margins look like? How much of that income is profit? What are the startup costs of such a business?\n\n- Are they raking in this much money because their marketing strategy is fantastic? What is it? \n\n- Is it a case of perfect product-market fit? How did they identify and/or validate it? \n\n- Is their customer service unparalleled? Why? \n\n- Do they have the advantage of economies of scale, or are do they have a first-mover advantage in a relatively untapped niche? \n\n- Did their sales go up or down in the past year? What does that say about the market? \n\n- How do their earnings compare to other businesses in their vertical? What does this suggest about the state of their industry? \n\n- What does their team, process, or tech stack look like? Are one or more of these factors driving their success?\n\nObviously some of these points might fit better under a different question (e.g. HOW &amp; WHY). \n\nYou also don\u2019t have to cover EVERYTHING (because then you\u2019d end up writing a book, lol). This is just to give you an idea of the kinds of info I look for when I read this type of content. \n\nPay attention to the types of questions readers are commenting on this thread (and future posts) to get a sense of which information is missing and/or interesting. \n\nI\u2019d probably create a reusable \u201ccompany bio\u201d template that briefly gives the main business details and then dive into a quick breakdown of the business model and how/why it works before leading into an analysis / \u201ckey takeaways\u201d section. \n\n4.  Get in the habit of citing your sources. In your newsletter, you can just hyperlink out, but for posts on platforms where you don\u2019t want to linkspam, a basic source list at the end of your post is good.\n\nThis helps build reader trust as they can see you did your research and didn\u2019t just make your data up, and it makes it easy for readers who want to learn more about the topic to keep reading (i.e. it makes for a good content \u201cuser experience\u201d).\n\nI\u2019m going to stop there because this is getting very long, but I\u2019m happy to answer questions if you want me to clarify anything. \n\nYou\u2019re building something really cool here \u2014 I\u2019m excited to see where you go with it.",

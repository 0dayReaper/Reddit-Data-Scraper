They buy emotions\".\n\n***\"Over 95% of our purchasing decisions are emotional\"*** \\- Harvard professor Gerald Zaltman\n\n\\---------------\n\n***EDIT because a few people asked already***   \nIf you liked it, I have a $0 [newsletter](http://kickstartsidehustle.com/) where I share more like this on a weekly basis\n\n\\----------------\n\nMarketing tools are just the tools to influence the human psyche in one way or another, with psychology in its core.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play with behavioral science (psychology in marketing) on a daily basis, so I thought I will share 16 biases here, so you can implement them in your business today to make a few extra bucks:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. DELIGHTERS - SURPRISE FEATURES THAT GO BEYOND CUSTOMERS' EXPECTATIONS\n\nDelighters are happy surprises that can make a difference. They blow us away when we get it.\n\nThey are not expected thus the dissatisfaction and frustration of their lack won\u2019t appear.\n\nIf you want to achieve high customer satisfaction, it might be a lot easier if you worked on delighters, like some fancy packaging than by providing more regular features like faster shipping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. BARNUM EFFECT - THE BELIEF IN VAGUE PREDICTIONS OR GENERAL PERSONALITY DESCRIPTIONS\n\nQuizzes are a perfect example of the Barnum Effect in action. They are also one of the most effective tools for conversion.\n\nSome marketers recorded a lead conversion rate of 38%. Bonkers!\n\nPeople turn to the quiz to get the number. It gives people something to look at, something to think of. Quizzes focus our attention on thinking about ourselves\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. CHEERLEADER EFFECT - INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SEEM MORE ATTRACTIVE WHEN PRESENTED IN A GROUP\n\nPeople are considered more attractive when they are in a group than when they are seen alone. The **cheerleader effect** occurs because:\n\n* We rapidly summarise a group of faces/images into a representation in our heads,\n* we see it to be highly attractive because of its average facial/image characteristics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. CENTRE-STAGE EFFECT - PEOPLE CHOOSE THE ITEM IN THE MIDDLE MORE OFTEN THAN THOSE ON THE SIDES\n\nPeople tend to be drawn to the middle product when presented with products situated side by side. The center-stage Effect is even more noticeable when we\u2019re buying something for someone else - we're more likely to use subtle suggestions when buying for someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. CHUNKING - GROUPED INFORMATION IS EASIER TO REMEMBER FOR PEOPLE\n\nChunking refers to the process of taking individual pieces of information and grouping them into smaller or larger units. Chunking is also a technique of breaking down big groups of information into smaller chunks that makes it easier for us to process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. CURIOSITY GAP - PEOPLE HAVE A DEEP DESIRE TO SEEK OUT MISSING INFORMATION\n\nAdd curiosity to your everyday productOne of the most famous marketers, Ogilvy, brought a simple 5-cent Eye Patch to the Hathaway shirt campaign - their model wore the eye patch which brought a lot of curiosity and depth around the character.\n\nThis little detail created a million-dollar story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. PEAK-END RULE - PEOPLE JUDGE AN EXPERIENCE BY ITS PEAK AND HOW IT ENDS\n\nCreate an emotional peak purposefully.\n\nDoesn\u2019t have to be expensive. You can easily create positive peak experiences with simple actions like using people's names, remembering important dates, or simplifying a process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. NOBLE EDGE EFFECT - PEOPLE TEND TO RESPECT SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES\n\nWhen companies demonstrate genuine social responsibility, they are rewarded with increased respect and greater profits.\n\nThis has been a popular trend in recent years as social responsibility has become more mainstream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. IKEA EFFECT - PEOPLE PLACE A HIGHER VALUE ON THINGS THEY\u2019VE CREATED THEMSELVES\n\nIn 1950, Betty Crocker's instant cake mixes arrived they weren't successful at all.\n\nThey put psychologist Ernest Dichter on the case.\n\nTurned out, homemakers didn't feel invested in the baking process and put no value in the product.\n\nTheir response: they replaced powdered eggs in the cake mix with the requirement to add fresh eggs.\n\nBy adding one more step, they had the person invested, and the cake mixers' sales went up. They gave the baker more ownership in the result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. NOSTALGIA EFFECT - THE FEELINGS OF NOSTALGIA MAKE US MORE WILLING TO SPEND MONEY\n\nNostalgia or sentimentality brings feelings of social connectedness.\n\nSocial connectedness decreases our desire for money, thus making us to spend more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 11. THE ZEIGARNIK EFFECT - PEOPLE REMEMBER INCOMPLETE TASKS BETTER THAN COMPLETED ONES\n\nThe Zeigarnik effect is a psychological phenomenon describing a tendency to remember interrupted or incomplete tasks or events more easily than tasks that have been completed.\n\nZeigarnik Effect pushes audiences to crave completed stories, resolved problems, answered questions, and achieved goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 12. UNDERDOG EFFECT - PEOPLE TEND TO SUPPORT THE SIDE THAT IS EXPECTED TO LOSE, OVER THE FAVORITE\n\nWhen your competitor is much bigger with access to great resources your story as an underdog might be of great advantage.Note - works best if the competitor doesn't have a good reputation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 13. IN-GROUP BIAS - PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THEIR OWN GROUP'S SUPERIORITY TO ANY OTHER\n\nIn-group bias is our tendency to favor whatever group the person associates herself with at a particular time.\n\nApple customers are a great example of a well-built sense of community among Apple users.\n\n*Here\u2019s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes\u2026 the ones who see things differently \u2014 they\u2019re not fond of rules\u2026 You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them because they change things\u2026 they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.*\n\n\u2014 Steve Jobs, 1997\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 14. RECOGNITION OVER RECALL - MEMORY FOR RECOGNIZING THINGS IS BETTER THAN MEMORY FOR RECALLING THINGS\n\nOn your website, you want to make sure the objects and operations a user might want to use are visible on the screen so that they can always recognize them rather than having to recall them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 15. WEATHER EFFECTS - WEATHER AFFECTS OUR MOOD AND OUR DECISIONS\n\nUsing weather targeting tools like WeatherAds, users can set automated ads to be released under specific conditions. Some brands, by matching ads with the current weather, exceeded its campaign goal by 46%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 16. NOVELTY EFFECT - PEOPLE SEEK OUT NOVEL EXPERIENCES\n\nThe novelty effect is our tendency for a constant small improvement to things, not because of any actual improvement in learning or achievement, but in response to increased interest or competition.\n\nThe novelty of a new feature might bring in new conversions (some tests showed a 2% increase after introducing a new checkout design), but after time the novelty will wear off and show the true effectiveness of a new feature or product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nThat's it!\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions regarding emotional marketing &amp; branding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked it, I have a $0 [newsletter](http://kickstartsidehustle.com/) where I share more like this on a weekly basis",

Agencies rarely have the patience to put in the work. Old school \u201cemotional\u201d storytelling techniques are more prevalent.\n\nMeanwhile, virtually no one is capable of taking emotions out of purchase decisions. People bring up brands like Apple vs. Android, but where it really gets you is all the everyday shit where you\u2019ve likely never once thought about why you buy that brand. Because there\u2019s too many little choices, and it\u2019s just not worth it.",

Work in a similar space so am 'aware' of the impact of branding, but good god you are right that you cant fight it everywhere all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm into the outdoors and was at Costco the other day. Their camping and outdoor supplies are 50-80% cheaper ACROSS THE BOARD than what you would find at an REI. But REI packages the sense of adventure with their store and brands, funnel in purpose (i.e. your money goes to support these causes), and have brands that make you think you are getting a truly superior product. This isnt to say REI or Audi or whoever is evil or manipulative - their shoppers clearly enjoy their products - but most of the time you pay for brand name and nothing else.",

Too many choices distracts people or frustrates them to where they decide to go somewhere else. Not giving people the choice or option to find that product locally creates the supply demand science. They have to buy it from here only or they believe they do because they don\u2019t have the time to research other places to buy it at.",

But I bet you shop at REI anyway, even if it's just to take a look around. (I live near the flagship store, though; maybe other REIs are more utilitarian.)\n\nMany of the techniques above apply to selling, not branding, though I realize some purchasing funnels are longer than others.",

It costs a lot more for the same level of product. \n\nOrganic labels sadly aren\u2019t regulated and claims about organic coffee being safer to drink aren\u2019t necessarily true. Types of mold and mycotoxins are found in organically processed coffee not typically found in traditional coffee. \n\nNow I\u2019m not here to debate the merits of organic food at all but my point is consumers can have different opinions on what is rational and to someone else it could be seen as an emotional decision.",

How could it be anything other than irrational emotion of not wanting to spend more money in the moment in order to save your life in the long-term? Choosing to spend more money in the moment to save your life could only ever be the rational decision (under the assumption that the more expensive product is actually saving the world you live in).",

If Car A has to commute 40 miles to work every day that would be $6,240 spent just on commuting gas for Year 1. Meanwhile, Car B will only have to spend $415.98 for the year on gas. This shows the total COST for Car A is $11,240 in Year 1, and the COST for Car B is $10,415.98.\n\nUnder the assumption that someone can afford either car, how can it be rational to choose based on price, rather than cost?",

We had some coursework in decision making in B-school, and what they called cognitive bias was behavior like anchoring, confirmation bias, overconfidence, false correlations, etc.  The cases involved colossal screw-ups by organizations, like the \"go\" decision that led to the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy.\n\nDecision making is a weird field of business academia because its not technical and therefore extremely approachable.  I signed up for an elective in it and thought it was so trivial that I dropped it and I can't say that was a bad decision. OTOH another classmate took the elective and went on to become a full professor specializing in it.  The research is important and almost universally useful, but you can basically get up to speed just by reading a couple of books or even just some articles - I know HBR likes to cover those kind of topics as they're accessible and relatable.",

If something is comfortable or I\u2019ve already had a good experience with something, that\u2019s my bias. \n\n I rock a $420 iPhone SE because it\u2019s user friendly and integrated, and the cheapest phone they offer. \n\nI drive a $1450 crown vic because you guessed it, it\u2019s cheap. \n\nI wear the cheapest clothes, the only exception would be if I find a pair of pants or shirt that fits more comfortably. Couldn\u2019t care less about the marketing. \n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to any company. We travel a lot and use strictly Airbnb again because of the cost and history of ease of use. We primarily fly with delta airlines because of the positive experience we\u2019ve had with them. Assigned seats, the seats are usually a bit more comfortable, provided headphones and movies. Also usually less crowded and less noise (kids) compared to southwest but we still use southwest when it\u2019s the most convenient (flying from Stl to Denver round trip for $300). \n\nI usually find myself being aware of emotional marketing tactics and pull back. I see a cool car commercial or even see a nicer car in person and just reel myself back in remembering the cost of the product. \n\nBasically if something costs more than $0 I already don\u2019t want it, and I\u2019m going to need valid logical and rational reasons why I should make a purchase before doing so.",

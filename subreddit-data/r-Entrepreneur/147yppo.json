    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI operate a service business that does $150k gross, with 55% profit margins. \n\nUp to this point, I've been working off of referrals only while still nailing down my process and model. \n\nNow that I feel good about the service and feel confident that it's world class. I've built a good social media following but haven't ran any paid ads. \n\nMoving forward, I want to ramp ads and start driving more traffic to my website.\n\nThe problem is that my website is set up through square and is just a few shitty, low res pics. I'm an entrepreneur, not a website developer/creator/whatever you call them.\n\nI've considered Upwork, but not sure what I'm asking for. \n\nI just need someone to revamp my website, almost completely. The base framework is there and I'm sure I could improve it myself, but again that's not my highest and best use of time. \n\nWHAT, HOW, Where can I get my website redone from a reputable source? I have no idea how much $$$ things like this cost.",

            "comment": "What service are you in? My niche is home services businesses. What\u2019s your current website look like? You can PM me a link to check out. I run an agency and do this everyday with clients. I can help you with it if you\u2019d like. \n\nFor websites, you get what you pay for. A GOOD website should cost in the thousands. We charge $3500. That includes design and development and everything. Other places could charge $800 and you get a run of the mill wix or Wordpress template flip that won\u2019t do you much better than your current site. \n\nWhen looking for agencies to work with, put their example sites in this tester \n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev\n\nIf they score under 50 then they aren\u2019t good at what they do. This is Google\u2019s page speed score evaluator. Google uses these scores when ranking your site and it even affects how your ads perform. If you have low scores, you lose ranking you could have if you had better ones. Any good web developer or agency should know this since it\u2019s been over two years since google made the switch to mobile first indexing and implementing the core vitals metrics. If they aren\u2019t considering these in their sites and at least TRYING to get better scores then they aren\u2019t up to date. This shit is important now more than ever. And if someone is gonna charge you thousands they better damn well make a good site that scores at least in the 80\u2019s. My sites score 98-100/100 for reference. I spent months studying the core vitals and researching new ways to code websites to make google happy and improve these scores. Once you get the hand of it it\u2019s actually not that hard. But if you\u2019re using wix or cheap Wordpress themes you purchased then it will be impossible to get decent scores just because of the baggage that comes with using them and their bloated code. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I\u2019ve been doing  this for years and based outside Seattle. So if you\u2019re stateside I\u2019ll definitely be able to help. Europe or other places, not so much. I only know my market in US and Canada and what does well here.",

But problem is the easier it is the lower quality it is and the lower your returns. If it was that easy there\u2019d be no SEO companies and everyone would be on the front page. Unfortunately there\u2019s a science and methodology behind what makes a good website rank and convert and they don\u2019t explain those to their customers because if the did they wouldn\u2019t have customers\u2026",

They are not too good as you have similarly experienced using Square. If you are a small business, you should not be charged very much. Some programmers charge flat rates or hourly. I would go for flat rates like $x per page. As for reputation, Citrous\\_Oyster has a good track record.\n\nI would post your site so that better advice can be given.",

My agency can help you with design and development of a new and improved website if you're interested. \n\nWe have an up-front option and also offer a simple monthly subscription (this one has been popular so far with small business owners) where we handle everything for you as far as your website goes. It's an easy way to get an awesome, professional website at an affordable rate.\n\nI'm curious if you have assets you'd want to feature on your site already? Such as photos of your shop/team etc? If you were local or nearby I'd also offer to come do the photography, but in case you don't have any assets yet, we can also lease some very nice photos from Adobe Stock.  We can handle everything, so that you can focus on making money and doing what you do best! \n\nEdit to add: All of our sites are hand-coded HMTL and CSS, to guarantee optimized page speed scores and long-term stability and performance. They also include analytics, so that you can gain more insight into your audience and potential customers.\n\nHit me up if you have any questions!",

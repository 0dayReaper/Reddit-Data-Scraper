    "postText": "Hello I\u2019m at the very beginning of this journey and my biggest impasse right now is the question above. I have an exact product in mind, with design sketches and photos and descriptions, but how the heck do I take that and make it into a reality? How can I protect confidentiality and go about it legally? What should I be asking for even if I were to get in touch with a good manufacturer? Is a manufacturer all I need?\n\nI\u2019m based in USA and ideally would like it to be from here, but I\u2019m open to other countries if the quality can be upheld.",

There are sourcing companies that can help you with that as well. I am working with one from China and very happy thus far",

            "comment": "It's pretty, but you're completely missing the boat if you're actually trying to sell people things.\n\n(If this is a cover for a money laundering effort and you're just trying to push the cash through the back end and don't actually want anyone to buy, then kudos, you're on the right track.)\n\nLet's go through the issues one by one.\n\nThe domain - People are going to forget and then wonder - \"Is it [hermitshop.com](https://hermitshop.com) or is it [thehermitshop.com](https://thehermitshop.com) or [hermitsshop.com](https://hermitsshop.com) or [thehermitsshop.com](https://thehermitsshop.com) ?\" when the whole goal of having a domain is to make it as simple and easy to remember as possible. Now you could buy the other domains and redirect them, but it might be easier to just buy a domain that has some relevance to what it is you're selling. If I'm thinking a shop for hermits, I'm definitely not thinking it has any relationship to landscape sculpture.\n\nThe website - Don't make people go digging. This is a website that currently sells all of 3 products, sculpture maps of Australia, Toronto, and the Bay Area. Those should all have their product listings on the home page, along with the options / prices.\n\nAs it is now, you have to click through a couple of pages to get to the individual product, and then to a separate website if to sell people the actual product if they want to buy it.\n\nFurther, the product as described on the individual product page appears to be a weird circular shield shape with diameters from about 4 to 10 inches. I don't know what kind of home decor you've been working with, but the miniature market is pretty small.  Awkwardly, the description of the products on the third party order page shows them as rectangular.\n\nI don't know how big the market is for &lt;10\" 3d printed maps that cost $60-$360, but even if it's there, making it hard to figure out what they're actually getting and making them click through multiple pages, isn't going to boost sales.\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I'd take the website down for the time being, and go to some cartography / landscape art / city forums and participate there and advertise the products with a link directly to the shapeways page to test market demand.\n\nIf there's a demand for the product, you can always build out the website later. If you're trying to sell lead balloons and nobody wants them, it might be better to pivot to something people are actually willing to spend money on and create your products accordingly.\n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\nThe main vehicle for advertising this product will be a future YouTube channel called The Hermit's Show, presented by an animated 3D old man. On its own, it is easy to forget indeed, but for people coming from the YT channel, I guess it won't be a problem.\n\nIt only has 3 products now, but will have 100 plus soon, across multiple categories, so I can't create a website revolving around just these. This is also the reason why the title isn't about landscape sculptures. The shop will sell all types of niche stuff: microorganisms and cells, anatomy pieces, planets, historical figures, etc. \n\nAbout the shield shape taking to a square product, there was a link error, which I believe might have been on the website builder's end, but now it should be fixed.\n\nYou have to click through 2 buttons to get to the Shapeways page, and 3 buttons in total to buy the item, coming from the home page. While the ideal would be only 1 button, I guess this isn't a deal breaker, or even an outlier when it comes to online shopping for bigger stores. Selling through Shapeways allows me to bypass complexities with import duties, VAT, and shipping worldwide, so I will have to stick with it for now, for better or worse.",

It cuts off on my smaller screened laptop, because your site isn't detecting it is a smaller width screen...",

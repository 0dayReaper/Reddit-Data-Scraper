    "postText": "With the latest Amazon affiliate changes, we might have a lot of people switching over from affiliate marketing to Ecommerce so I figured I'd share 11 years of experience building, starting and growing Ecommerce stores on Google. (I've seen it all... computer stores, fashion stores, health supplement stores, gourmet food, jewellery, sunglasses, tape, sex toys, guitar stores, drone stores, recreational vehicles, paintball stores, water filtration, home appliances and more). \n\n**Obligatory Proof:** https://i.gyazo.com/dd374c572ca7ed2233afea432a74f856.png\n\nEven though I frequently work with 1m-15m/year E-commerce sites, I really enjoy the startup phase. \n\nThere's something really exciting about **starting a new Ecommerce store so that's what I'm going to focus on today.**\n\nHere are some of examples of the Ecommerce ranking technique I'm going to share. Sometimes doubling (even tripling) in Google traffic.\n\n**Brand new Ecommerce Startup Proof Example #1**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/79d789e8310710d7683b62728abe386b.jpg\n\n**Another new Ecommerce store Example #2**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0692384554ac1d223988f0882f95675a.png\nThis Ecommerce that could never rank no matter what they tried triples their traffic in less than 3 months\n\n**And another Client Example #3**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d13b6264536b17a3428e5b0088e711cb.png\nAnother example of an ecommerce store dramatically increasing their traffic.\n\nThese techniques are unique to Ecommerce stores (so those pesky bloggers can\u2019t use these) and provide long lasting results.\n\nSo how do you get Google to notice your store and send you massive amounts of visitors?\n\nLet's start with the most common one (my least favorite but I want to include it because it works... heck many Reddit 'success stories' have followed this exact strategy. I believe most people should at least TRY this one first and then more on the others if it doesn't span out.)\n\n**The Grand Slam Technique**\n\nThe Grand Slam technique involves doing something BIG to get a lot attention. It\u2019s the explosive, \u201cplan it for three weeks and hope it works out\u201d approach.\n\nEssentially, this is how you want to do it if you want to follow Google recommendation of \u201cCreate great content and people will come\u201d and have a chance of succeeding.\n\nThe \u201cgo big\u201d method often involves a marketing stunt with the aim of going viral or a large piece of content. You invest several weeks and create something that you believe will capture the world\u2019s attention using your product.\n\n**For example:**\n\nYour Ecommerce store sells tape. To demonstrate the strength of your tape, you decide to [shoot a video in which you lift a car with your product.](https://i.gyazo.com/8b5e88831bec1a0b5eb503a6850652de.png)\n\nYou spend weeks putting it together, coordinating a crane to lift the car, a camera crew and a boatload of tape.\n\nDoes the video go viral? ? Well, maybe! But then again, maybe not.\n\nStatistically\u2026 it doesn\u2019t. *Most* things don\u2019t go viral. There are just too many other cool things happening in the world.\n\nHowever, you only need one hit to make it. (DollarShaveClub anyone?) \n\nThat\u2019s why I prefer the:\n\n**Perfect Perk Technique**\n\nThis technique works SO WELL that Google has recently decided that you probably shouldn\u2019t do it because it will give you an unfair advantage over the competition.\n\nThere is a weakness in their algorithm and, as you\u2019ll soon see\u2026 it\u2019s practically impossible for them to stop it.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as sexy as directing your own mini-commercial but it does deliver massive amounts of Google traffic. Plus, if you want to be a director, you can do that with the profits from this approach.\n\nEven if you know nothing about search engine optimization and you\u2019re in a competitive industry, this is for you.\n\nInstead of relying on what other people think of our blog post or video, we\u2019re going to give Google exactly what it wants\u2026 and in turn, it will give us exactly what we want: traffic.\n\nThe first step is convincing Google that you have the best store in your industry. So when someone asks Google, \u201cWhere do I get this widget?\u201d\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/681f0983a02f861278406f866d807b93.png\n\nGoogle answers, \u201cRight here, at your store!\u201d\n\n**So what are the main things that Google looks for?**\n\n*Good product listings.\n*A ton of people talking about your products.\n\n*Convince Google that you have these two elements and you\u2019re golden.*\n\nHowever before I get to the sexy stuff (getting people to talk about your product using the Perfect Perk technique), I feel I\u2019d be doing you a disservice if I didn\u2019t at LEAST mention what makes a good product listing. Without this, everything else you do is useless.\n\n**So what makes a good product listing?**\n\nI want to tell you a little secret that will make a lot of ecommerce gurus cringe:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to do that much for product listings in order to rank on Google.\nIn fact, as long as you convey the right signals, you\u2019ll rank just fine.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause, all you need is a slightly better product listing than your competition.\nAnd the truth is, most ecommerce stores have no idea what they are doing!\n\nThey use the same stock photography that their supplier sent them, they copy paste the 75 word description from the wholesale catalog and then call it a day!\n\nIn the restaurant industry, that\u2019s the equivalent of reheating frozen food in the microwave! It just won\u2019t cut it.\n\n**So what DOES Google want?**\n\nAt a bare minimum, it wants an original picture of your product and an original description.\n\nThis can be as quick as taking a snapshot of the image with your IPhone and writing the basics about the item you\u2019re trying to sell.\n\n* Main feature\n* Specifications?\n* What is it made of?\n* How do you use it?\n* What kind of warranty does it have?\n\nPreemptively answering the questions that your customer might have about your product will help you rank higher on Google and help you sell more.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, have 5-6 pictures of your product taken by a professional photographer.\n\n**Here are 3 examples of great product listing:**\n\nI annotated the product listing examples to highlight the elements that contribute to great rankings for each website.\n\n**Great Product Listing Example #1:**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/8b2b34fe57f97309cd8782668acd8db0.jpg\nBoom By Cindy Joseph\n\nThey combines all the proper SEO elements with all the best conversion elements. There is a massive amount of social proof on the page which increases conversions.\n\n*Here are the highlights:*\n\n* Multiple original images taken by a professional photographer.\n* Multiple original videos (they also count as unique content)\n* Original description in the form of benefits\n* Huge amount of reviews. Reviews count as content!\n\n**Great Product Listing Example #2:**\nSafety Tape By Creative Safety Supply\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b689d7900fb7e043a088a32c7abcb321.jpg\n\nThey produce extremely useful product pages, including many visual elements and additional resources that are useful to the user.\n\n*Some of the highlights:*\n\n*Massive amount of original, professional images\n*Breadcrumb navigation (This helps the click-through-rate of your Google search result listing by adding categories in the results)\n* Extensive original description\n* Multiple reviews (not shown in the picture)\n* Related resources and guides\n\n**Great Product Listing Example #3:**\nLevi Jeans by Amazon\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/530b820e0b17ce9ea6983663486e011c.jpg\n\nWhy does Amazon rank for nearly everything? Three reasons: Content, content and more content. (And 2.5B backlinks doesn\u2019t hurt either)\n\n*Some of the highlights:*\n\n* Multiple original images\n* Extensive related amount of products, images and information\n* Reviews. Over 5000 reviews creates a massive amount of original content that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nTo Google, pictures count as content.\n\nIf you take 2 pages and everything else is equal\u2026 and one with more content wins every time.\n\n*If you want other people to complete your content, then allow reviews to be posted on the site and let your customers ask &amp; answer questions. This will count towards your original content! This is one of the main reasons Amazon does so well in the search results.*\n\nAnd now\u2026 the fun part.\n\n**How To Get Links To An Ecommerce Store**\n\nHow does an Ecommerce store get backlinks when:\n\n* The competition refuses to link to you\n* Related industry sites are too busy writing about the manufacturers instead of linking to the store selling the product!\n* No one really knows you.\n\nYou could take the first approach which is to build something and hope it goes viral\u2026 however I prefer to exploit the weaknesses in Google\u2019s algorithm by manufacturing real, high quality links on related industry sites.\n\nThis method produces BETTER results anyway.\n\nHowever, before I share this method with you, it\u2019s important that you understand one important element about traffic.\n\n**The Misconception That Holds Most People Back**\n\nThe biggest misconception that people have about organic Google traffic is that it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d and therefore all link-building efforts must also be free.\n\nInstead, you will need a small investment. As soon as you adopt the mentality that you\u2019ll invest X into link building with the objective of making Y, you\u2019ll be on your way to success.\n\nIf you invest $100 into link building and you make $200 profit, you win.\n\nIf you invest $500 and make $5000 profit? You win even more.\n\nOne mistake many new Ecommerce owners make is competing for #1 rankings with a budget of $0 while their competitors are spending $500.\n\n*My last SEO test project cost $4361 and has generated (at the time of writing) over $47941.30 in profits.*\n\n**It\u2019s all about getting a positive return on investment.**\n\nWhen you adopt the mentality that Time = Money and that Money = Traffic, you can make much better decisions with your investments.\n\nThis will change your focus from the \u201ccheapest\u201d option (which won\u2019t work) to the \u201cbest value\u201d option\u2026 which will provide you with the highest return on investment.\n\nThe first, and often most cost efficient way of acquiring new links when launching a new Ecommerce store is\u2026 drum roll the good'old fashioned PRESS RELEASE.\n\nBefore you jump off the page thinking: \u201cOh I\u2019ve heard this one before, I tried a press release and it didn\u2019t do anything\u201c, remember our new mentality:\n\nWe don\u2019t want cheap, we want good value.\n\n**Here\u2019s what you should avoid:**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/fa3cf3ec0350e948f157746453cf876f.png\n\nInstead of getting a $60 press release that promises to get you good rankings and \u201cinto 10000 news agencies\u201d and \u201cinto Google news\u201d, spring for a professional press release that will get you in front of real journalists that will write articles about you.\n\nAnd quite frankly, those cost more..\n\nDo you think journalists are reading all the crap-o-la that comes from the $60 press release services?\n\nJournalists are looking for real stories\u2026 about real businesses. Those stories tend to be mentioned on larger news sites such as PRNewswire, MarketWired and BusinessWire.\n\nSo, submit your high-quality releases to these sites.\n\n**When you submit your first press release about your Ecommerce store, you want to go in with a purpose:**\n\nHow does your store differentiate itself? Why do you exist? Why are you better than the competition?!\n\n*If you want your press release to succeed two things must happen. You must write a good headline and get it in front of the right journalists. Use a premium press release services to get your headline it in front of the right journalists.*\n\nIf you\u2019re ever going to have a sale or a promo, now is the time. I don\u2019t have time to cover the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of a successful press release (that\u2019s for another article) but if you\u2019re ever in a pickle, you can hire a marketing expert to find an interesting angle for you.\n\nJust remember, when you write the press release, you aren\u2019t writing it for customers, but for journalists.\n\nOne single press release CAN land you thousands of high quality links that can power your site for years to come which makes it the best investment a new Ecommerce store can make.\n\nTraffic from a well crafted press release:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/06458c77123617faefb05ada03ea45d6.png\n\nA good press release got into the hands of a few journalists, sending thousands of visitors to my client\u2019s ecommerce store and generating dozens of DA30+ links on industry related sites.\n\n*Don\u2019t use a keyword for your anchor text when creating a press release. Use your brand name or a generic URL. This improves the chances of your press release being taken seriously by journalists and prevent potential over-optimization penalties.*\n\nThe truth is, Google doesn\u2019t want you to exploit this weakness in their algorithm. \n[(They tried)](http://searchengineland.com/google-links-in-a-press-release-should-be-nofollowed-like-advertisements-168339)\n\nGood press releases will provide massive SEO benefits and there is little they can do about it.\n\n**Hypothetical situation:**\n- $495 press release\n- 5 hours of work x $20 = $100\n\n$595 for potentially thousands of journalist seeing (and writing) about your store.\n\n**Worst case scenario:** You get featured on the standard boilerplate sites which will give you some backlink juice and get Google traffic flowing.\n\n**Best-case scenario:** A journalist picks up your story, writes a real article about you on a major site which immediately drives traffic, sales and skyrockets your Google rankings in one shot.\n\nSome multi-million dollar businesses, such as the http://www.headblade.com, have been made on the back of a SINGLE news article. https://i.gyazo.com/faa1a0120b1030550c279d7f63f3dd8e.png\n\nWhen that happens, many smaller websites \u201cborrow\u201d the story and rewrite it as their own, further accumulating natural links for your website.\n\n**An unlimited source of recommendations about your product and store**\n\nEvery industry has two main categories of websites:\n\n1. The sellers. (This is the Ecommerce stores, the suppliers and manufacturers.)\n    \n2. The reviewers/enthusiasts/news (the influencers). These are the large blogs and large authority sites that write on a daily basis about the industry. They typically carry a lot of weight.\n\nIt\u2019s your job, as a seller, to get all the influencers to recommend you.\n\nWhen Google detects that many influencers are linking to you, your store climbs up the Google ranks and generate massive amounts of traffic (and sales).\n\nHere\u2019s why this is a weakness in Google\u2019s algorithm:\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t know if the influencers are linking to you because you\u2019re a friend, because they think you have a good product or because you met them at a conference and promised them a perk.\n\nIn other words, as long as the influencers aren\u2019t advertising: \u201cGive me stuff and I\u2019ll link to you!\u201c, no one knows why an influencer links to anything!\n\n\u2026 and getting influencers to write about us is EXACTLY what we\u2019re going to exploit.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s where most people get it wrong.\n\nMost sellers approach influencers with the \u201cME ME ME\u201d mentality. In other words, they are only thinking of what they want instead of what the influencer wants.\n\nThe typical email that will get you nowhere as a seller is:\n\n*\u201cHey, I just launched this store, we have amazing products and I thought you\u2019d want to let your audience know about us.\u201d*\n\nNO, NO, AND NO\n\nRemember when I said that you have to think of Google traffic as an investment and that the focus is getting the best return on investment?\n\nWell, that translates to figuring out what the influencer wants.\n\nFor instance, most influencers will gladly accept money.\n\nEven though the official Google rule is to add \u201cnofollow\u201d to the links, this is rarely enforced by the bloggers.\n\n*The sites you want to avoid are sites that are dedicated to ONLY posting sponsored posts. Those sites typically serve low quality content. The best sites are the ones with an active community and visitors. An easy tell is to check to see if there are any comments on the articles. Good sites tend to have comments on each article.*\n\nInfluencers make their living from this kind of stuff so they are always on the lookout for good opportunities.\n\nFocus on the influencer\u2019s needs and start the conversation with: \u201cHey, I just launched this store and was wondering how much it would cost to have you mention my store in your next article\u201d will get you a much higher success rate.\n\nFrom there, I recommend looking up the site metrics &amp; traffic (how powerful it is) and then you can easily calculate the cost to see if it\u2019s worth it:\n\n* 1 mention from influencer #1 with a DA58 website (2300 daily visitors) = $200\n* 1 mention from influencer #2 with a DA34 website (750 daily visitors) = $250\n* 1 mention from influencer #3 with a DA64 website (3300 daily visitors) =$750\n\nUmmm, influencer #3 seems overpriced and influencer #1 is providing some good value for the money!\n\nQuick, simple, repeatable.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s not worth it, negotiate!\n\n*You can typically negotiate at least 50% off whatever price they initially throw at you. The best negotiation tactic is to present quotes from competitive influencers. This will help you get the absolute best price for your post.*\n\n**Here is an actual conversation I had with an influencer:**\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/227b2234165b340414342d06eb39ebfb.png\n\nOnce you have more experience, you\u2019ll be able to guesstimate the amount of traffic / ranking boost that such a website can provide over the course of a year.\n\n**The Math:**\n\nThat $200 link from a DA58 website might result in an extra 14000 visitors over the course of a year. At a 2% conversion, that\u2019s 280 extra sales. And at an average of $34 profit on each sale, that\u2019s $9520 in profit. Not bad for a $200 link.\n\nYou might be looking at this thinking: \u201cDamn, how do I know what kind of profit I\u2019ll generate from a link?!\u201d\n\nWell, the truth is, you don\u2019t. However as you gain experience in your industry and you\u2019ll be able estimate the traffic a bit better. In my experience, even bad estimates are better than no estimates at all.\n\nThis is how you start building a solid foundation of influencers linking to your Ecommerce store.\n\nHowever\u2026 I saved the best for last.\n\nRemember that example where the influencer requested $750?\n\nWell, imagine you could get the same result for a fraction of the price?\n\nTypically, sponsored posts and advertorials tend to be pricey. They might still be worth it but there\u2019s a way to get influencers to respond for much cheaper. (Providing you with a higher ROI).\n\n** Nearly every influencer in your industry will be interested in your products . **\n\nThe best part is that YOU pay wholesale for your products but the perceived value is much higher.\n\nInfluencers love products (that\u2019s why they got into their industry in the first place) and they need products to review.\n\nIn fact, nearly every influencer has a section dedicated to reviews on their website.\n\nSo while a high-profile influencer might charge an exorbitant amount of money for a sponsored story about your Ecommerce store, he or she will gladly accept to review your product if you just send it over to them. This works so well that Google is freaking out, trying to figure out how to reduce the amount of influencers receiving free products and not disclosing it.\n\nThe weakness that we\u2019re exploiting is the following: Unless the influencer states that the product was sent to them or they openly advertise that they\u2019ll give you a link if you send them a product, Google doesn\u2019t know how the product got to the influencer. The only way for Google to stop this is to manually check sites openly admitting they are receive sponsored products in exchange for coverage.\n\n**The Perfect Perk**\n\nFor instance, I ran into a fashion blogger who wanted $750 for a sponsored post. But but after a bit of talking, we concluded that she would write a post about the Ecommerce store in exchange for a leather handbag valued at $350.\n\nWe\u2019re a store! We don\u2019t pay full price for our items\u2026 we only SELL our products at full price.\n\nThat handbag had a wholesale price of $120.\n\nWhich means\u2026\n\nWe get to be featured on a giant industry site for $120 instead of the standard $750.\n\nNow we\u2019re talking!\n\n**Here's how it went down:**\n\n- Wholesale handbag cost = $120\n- Shipping = $15\n- Time 1 hour = $15\n\nTotal cost: $150 for a DA64 link on a related industry site.\n\nIt gets EVEN better.\n\nThe review is all about our product. That means that if out of the thousands of readers who read it, a single person buys because of the recommendation, we\u2019ve already made our money back.\n\nEssentially\u2026 the link costs us absolutely nothing and we get to benefit from increase in Google traffic for years to come.\n\n**Here's what happened:**\n\n- Profit made from sales from the article = $300 (We sold 2 at $150 profit each)\n- Yearly increase in traffic (0.5%) = Approximately 1000 extra visitors\n- Additional sales from extra traffic (2% conversion) = 20 sales\n- Average profit from each sale ($56) = $1120\n\n$1120 long term profit + $300 immediate profit \u2013 $150 investment = $1270\n\nWhich means that we\u2019ve made $1270 in profit from our $150 handbag investment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you grow your traffic on a brand new Ecommerce store\u2026 making money as you move forward.\n\nThe best part?\n\nWhen major influencers start featuring your store and products, OTHER influencers will follow. Soon you\u2019ll have influencers contacting YOU, requesting samples, practically begging to write about you.\n\nFrom there, just rinse and repeat as long as you want and watch your traffic (and sales) grow. \n\nCheers Reddit!\n\n----\n\n**Edit:** Because I'm getting a lot of PM /questions about this (everyone's really nice, thanks!)\n\n* Here's my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ericlancheresseo/) if you want to stay up to date.\n\n* And [this is where I coach / help people](http://www.mytrafficresearch.com/main/) however registration for [Traffic Research](http://www.mytrafficresearch.com/)  is closed at the moment. (I can only support so many people at a time) \n\n**Edit 2:** Post back up. Thanks for all the positive feedback, and I'll try to answer as many questions as I can today. Yes, I noticed there was negative feedback as well (I guess that happens when posts hit a critical mass), everyone's entitled to their own opinion however try to stay kind to your fellow Redditors. I'm just sharing my experience for those that want to hear it. Cheers!",

I choose to teach them instead of telling them they shouldn't be in business. Some of course still fail, but I've helped a lot of people make their living. \n\nIt's easy to look down on people. My websites all make well above six figures and they're a small fraction of my businesses. I could look down on a lot of people that make less than me but I find joy in helping them and teaching them. Some come to the conclusion that business isn't for them on their own, others realize how much work they have ahead of them and are happy that they at least have a clear direction now. ",

Go on to a news site and check for 'sponsored' articles, they're petty cheeky these days, sometimes you don't realise it's a puff piece until you're halfway through where they start mentioning the brand that's being puffed up.\n\nIt'll typically start with a semi click bait head line, enough to pique your interest but not enough to set off your click bait alarm. The start will always be about some relevant problem worth reading about (doctors find unexpected cure for head aches!) and then comes the 'click here to see how xxxc discovered the power of....' which then instantly gives it away.\n\nThe key for planting the links is to make it look like someone genuinely found something useful and is writing a review when in truth it's probably garbage and someone's been paid to trick people.

OP already hinted at it that Google is in the process of fixing the issue of paid/perked links. While OP assumes that's not possible, I disagree. By looking at the link structure, what other outgoing links those so called influencers have and so on there are several indicators to find out if a link is natural or not. Google is careful with it because it could/will hurt legit links as well.\n\nSeveral years ago I sold links on my blog and over the last three years many of the agencies came back and plead that I remove the links again because Google found out they are bought and it hurt their ranking. \n\nGoogle has a form that allows everyone to report paid links and I am sure your competitors are eager to report you: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks?pli=1\n\nSidenote: In Germany it's illegal to sell links without clearly marking them as paid. Your competitors can send you an Abmahnung and you may have to pay a hefty penalty to them and pay their attorney.\n\nTake the first part of the advice, producing good content, writing press releases, getting in contact with journalists and bloggers and run with it. The second part is definitely not for people with \u201eZERO experience\u201c. \n\nBut you could learn from OP by looking at what he does instead of what he says. He shares advice that worked in the past as something that works in the future. And he does something that works now. You have seen all those image posts \u201eUpvote this so it becomes the first image when you google for TERM X\u201c. Google started to take social signals that are harder to fake seriously. Already #1 for \u201eEcommerce zero experience profitable Google\u201c http://imgur.com/a/CgRzV. #9 for \u201eEcommerce zero experience profitable\u201c http://imgur.com/a/sIOiZ. I am sure there are more search terms which this post is ranking well for. \n\nBut that's not all. It is on #10 of the all time top posts for this sub. http://imgur.com/a/Qdi2S\n200k people of his target audience. Again OP only hints at it that he doesn't run e-commerce for a living, but is consulting others. He has some kind of club with membership and doesn't take new clients at the moment. But that doesn't stops him from linking his facebook page and his consulting page. Not at first, because that would be fishy. With an Edit after the post sky rocketed.\n\nI don't say it's wrong what he does (link buying is wrong) or that he is an imposer. He obviously knows what he does, he put effort into the post, shared some good stuff and benefits from it. I just want you to take a second look.",

I know there are many people that have experience success selling cheap items from Alibaba/AliExpress however that just doesn't fit the long term business model (ecommerce stores) that I work with. \n\nFor determining what to sell / what's going to be hot, I strongly recommend using a stock market mindset. Try to figure out what's going to be trending in the upcoming few years. \n\nI go over this strategy here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrEIP0oYg88&amp; if you want to check it out. BEFORE you go out and set up an entire ecommerce store, I strongly recommend you test out your product by trying to sell it directly to friends, locally, on Facebook, Craiglist, Etsy, Ebay. \n\nValidate your idea (and product) in very small quantities before investing the time (and money) to set up an ecommerce store. \n\nAfter that, Shopify is the easiest way to start an ecommerce store! \n\n\n",

I have 6 years worth of notes compiled in it.  Not bad!\n\nI save it to a dropbox - I only started doing that this year.  Previously had it saved to OneDrive, but I don't use that account very often and it was a student account, so I realized my data probably wasn't safe there.\n\nI was reading some other people's comments and they're talking about cloud use and device freedom, that sounds neat!   I thought \"Dang I should get that!\"  But then realized this solution has been working for me. \n\nWhy did I adopt OneNote?  I was working an IT contract for a small consulting firm (Microsft Firm) and they were making a TON of money.  They did EVERYTHING in onenote.  We had done an entire helpdesk contract and kept all of our tickets in OneNote (that's when I learned of its power.) \n\nNow I keep everything there.  I have separate tabs for different ideas.  When I start learning about a new topic or something that I need in my arsenal, the first thing I do is open a tab.  \n\nExample.   T-Shirt screen printing. \n\nI need to learn about this, so I open a new tab and label it \"screenprinting\"\n\nThen I start asking myself questions, and I write them down?\n\"What is screenprinting?\"\n\"Does it use ink?\"\n\"What kind of machine do I need?\"\n\nSo on and so forth until I'm out of questions, then I start researching them.  As I find the answers, I one by one go back and paste the answers (with the source, in case I need to look at it again).  This ensures that when I have the question again (I have a terrible memory.)  I have quick access to it and the source so I don't have to ask myself \"do I trust that answer?\" \n\nThis also proves to be a great way to transfer immediate knowledge (of nearly everything you know, short of experience) directly to a team member in a QUICK efficient manner.\n\nOn team members, OneNote is perfect.  It helps to solve data duplication and error conflicts, it lets you work on the same project at the same time, it lets you save entire data files, print out, and extract text from images!  (Super Useful)\n\nI have multiple projects with multiple teams, so I use it to separate that kind of information.  You can make checkboxes, new pages, hyperlinks directly to your data.  It's kind of like having an internal website for your team.  I've tried lots of other team-collaboration software (basecamp, trello, whatever the other ones are) but they all left something to be desired and OneNote always just worked and had more features and power. \n\nThe way you can edit, drag things around, draw on it with the marker tools, you can whip up a quick mock web page that makes sense in minutes.   (not for use, just for visualizing)\n\nThe fact that you can endless scroll your document out to any width and height is perfect.  Inserting a large Visio Document?  No problem!!\n\nWhen I'm in the wild, I carry a notebook (pocket notebook, moleskine) and a pen.  Why?   I use to use a tablet (microsoft surface) and it was incredibly convenient.  Until I realize when you stop to whip out a tablet and take notes, it's incredibly rude.  It really jars a conversation, it takes time, you're guarding an expensive machine, you can't hand people notes, etc. \n\nSo I've leaned towards taking a pocket journal and a pen with me.  I hate ripping pages out of my notebook (it looks bad).  My journal has a pocket in the back.   I printed some business cards (thanks vistaprint) with a nice front with a logo, that's it.  The back is my name, e-mail address, phone number, I think I may have put a title on there too, but whatever.   Then the rest of the card is blank space with lines for writing.   This is a REALLY useful card.  I can give people notes and contact information in one fell swoop and I don't get those nasty tear lines in my notebook.  \n\nNow, none of this is perfect, but it suits me just fine.  If I'm away from my computer?  Guess what, I don't want to work!  So I don't need tablet access.  \n\nIf I'm not at my workspace?  I don't want to work!  So it's not important to have multi-device access.  I have a cloud version in the dropbox for data redundancy (If you don't have that, do it!  Nothing worse than having 6 years of notes deleted).\n\nIn the end, your data repository is going to be your brain and lifesource, where all the good thoughts go and develop.\n\nIt fits my lifestyle and the way I work and allows me to collaborate with lots of people.   Is it perfect for everyone?  No.  Is it perfect for me?  No. \n\nPick the tool that fits your needs and meets your lifestyle.  \n\n",

(I can't image this comment going over well on Reddit ;) \n\n- This goes without saying however high margin items are much easier to sell than low margin products. For instance, selling computer parts is EXTREMELY challenging because there are 10-15% margins. Selling supplements/fashion products have 200-300% margins so you can invest more in marketing. \n\n- Sell something that is going to be in demand for the next 3-5 years (this seems obvious however you'd be amazed at how many people invest into a dying trend. ie: starting an acai berry store is probably a bad idea now)\n\nA misconception is that you really don't need many items to make an ecommerce store successful. Instead, you need something that people want! McDonalds had less items on the menu but they sold much more of it! ",

Create unique content for product listings and make sure you have reviews (begs the question, how do you get those reviews in the first place when nobody knows you or trusts you).\n\n2. Invest in a decent PR company that will spin a good story from your store and get it shared widely (won't the success of this depend on the uniqueness or your store/product). \n\n3. Get influencers to write about your store/product by offering free samples\n\n4. Profit? \n\n\nThis all seems like great advice and I'm by no means an eCommerce expert, but it's hardly the guaranteed recipe for success. Surely choosing the product is the no 1 most difficult and important task, then creating the branding or making it unique enough to be sharable so these press releases aren't a waste of time. \n\nI'd like to start an eCommerce business and when I do I'll probably follow the advice (although the only new idea I get from it is the press release one - I did get the impression these were a bit pointless before), but without choosing your product it's all a bit moot, and no one is going to help you find that great product from Aliexpress that's going to bank you 500K in a year.",

I don't understand why some people are getting worked up about what you said.  \"If you haven't figured this stuff out, you shouldn't be running a store.\"  Psh, whatever, we all start somewhere!\n\nAnyway I've been running a business but selling primarily through eBay and Amazon despite having my own site.  I'd like to increase sales of course, but never really knew the appropriate strategy to increasing rankings on ebay/Amazon or to SEO.  I believe I've had around 4,000 sales in just under 2 years but it's been a while since I've tallied them up.\n\nThe problem I have with your PR strategy is that I am selling a very niche product, something that no one except those in a very particular community would be at all interested in.  There would be no journalist picking up a story, of that I am 100% certain.  So it seems a bit useless to go that route.\n\nIt does seem like I should talk to influencers in the niche and see what I can give them in exchange for product promotion.  Feels wrong, like bribery, but I suppose that's what must be done.\n\nAny other tips for a very niche product that the general populace would have no interest in?",

You won't find a site fully dedicated to cat-party-hats (I just checked, I did find this however: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/32/4a/33/324a33da8f3a5e64a42dc1aa45352754.jpg ) but you'll find communities of people that might be interested. Talk to the influencers responsible for those communities.\n\n",

Watching YouTube videos of people hyping up shopify blabbing about useless info has given me a headache and a good look at what my future competition is willing to do in order to \"take out the competition\" so to speak. Not surprised by these methods but honestly I don't understand why people waste their time with it. Probably just click bait tactics trapping people I mean hey it happened to me. But anyways content like this article is always refreshing especially for a less experienced person. I am new to the ecommerce world myself and I was wondering if someone could help me with something. I've been playing with a few drop shipping ideas for the past three months and I cant decide on a niche or even a theme for my brand. What I mean is, I have thought of at least half a dozen business ideas and even found products for them on ali express through the \"Shopify Experience.\" But I don't want to launch a business unless I'm certain that it will be able to compete with the hundreds of other small ecommerce. I see shopify stores using the EXACT SAME images and products that I found to add to my store. This is frustrating as I'm constantly pushing to find more specific markets but at the end of the day consumerism is consumerism and advertising is advertising that's just the name of the game. Either way what I'm trying to say is do you experienced ecommerce entrepreneurs believe I should spend the time to establish a solid market opportunity and specific niche before I launch my site or should I just do what Justin Wong of so aesthetic apparel did and copy and past Ali express products on a flamboyantly coloured shopify theme at 200% narked up priced to earn an alleged \"$12 a month\" because that's ridiculous  and if true I'm just overwhelmed by the simplicity. Basically I'm just gonna make a shitty version of Ali express with less products, different pictures and an ergonomic website then contact young people with huge IG following to promote my company by giving them free products. Can anybody tell me if this is a good idea. THANK YOU!",

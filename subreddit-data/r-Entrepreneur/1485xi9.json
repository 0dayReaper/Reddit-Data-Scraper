Is it another job to take on? Something that\u2019s dreaded?\n\nI\u2019d like to have insight to this perspective as I like to see things from all angles. \nIt may help me be a better apprentice in the future and maybe connect with my future mentors a bit better. \n\nThank you so much in advance!",

Most would describe themselves as self made. \n\nMentors are valuable but find them organically rather than thrusting yourself upon people. Don\u2019t look for mentors are people to emulate as the world changes dramatically between decades - look for mentors who teach you how to be moment to moment.",

I have mentors already that have no idea who I am or what my name even is. But when they speak, I listen. Simply because I want to be where they are or because I love their ideas. \n\nFinding an actual mentor isn\u2019t really a task I have, more of a opportunity window I\u2019m waiting on to open like you mentioned. I could definitely see what image thrusting yourself at someone as an apprentice would give you and I 100% want to avoid that.",

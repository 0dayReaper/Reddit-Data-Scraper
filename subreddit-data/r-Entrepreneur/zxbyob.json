It's very common setting in Tanzania. I sell black coffee and ginger tea which is like 100Tsh per cup.\n\nFrom starting with only 25$ as a capital untill now I managed save up to 250$ dollars . Although it's tough as I live in a very tight budget to save this. \n\nI'm Targeting to a have a nice place and buy an espresso machine.\n\nI just wanted to share my entrepreneur story. Thanks",

If you keep me updated monthly and share with me a better understanding of what life is like in your country and educate me (I\u2019m an American who knows nothing about your country!), I will forgive the loan in totality (you will owe me nothing). \n\nThis offer expires in 30 days meaning if it takes you more than 30 days to find a machine and us to figure out how I pay for it, I\u2019m going to move on. \n\nI just like your hard work and hustle. Check my Reddit history, I\u2019m legit. \n\nWhat do I get from this? Helping you and learning. I have a kid who is very curious about the world and having you record him some videos of life where you live would be illuminating. \n\nAnd I won\u2019t entertain any messages from anyone else on this.

You can attract people through the smell of freshly made cookies or just grill them over fire.\n\nAlso espresso machines are hit and miss. Automatic machines break often even if regularly cleaned. Jura is a good brand, if you can afford the premium. Manual espresso machines require a powerline source, so you won't be mobile. The best machines are the small ones that you can handle yourself and are easy to clean and maintain. They require a bit more hands on, but they are more affordable and require less maintenance like no specialized cleaner. I see a lot of people in arabian countries selling sand coffee very succesful. Do you plan to go this route?",

That way, you can sell different products to different customers.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, you'll be doing great soon!",

In the long run, $500 for an export license will be well worth it, especially if you\u2019re able to source quality green coffee on a regular basis .\n\nFeel free to PM me, I may have some ideas for you .",

Their 50lb, or 22kg bags, are about $300 to $500 USD, not including shipping. Not sure what grade your coffee is, but they sell specialty-grade coffee, and I'll usually go through one bag every few months or so.\n\nIf you are able to ship to the US, or you ever find a way to export, I'd definitely be interested in trying some! If not, then no worries.\n\nEither way, I'm not sure if there is any way I could send you money, but I'd happily send you a donation to help support your coffee business. Coffee is a passion of mine, and I'd love to support people who grow the stuff I enjoy drinking every day!\n\nEdit: CoffeeShrub also as [https://www.sweetmarias.com/](https://www.sweetmarias.com/), from which they sell smaller amounts for even higher prices.",

Speaking about how an espresso machine would help his business so much.. How is that so if OP has only just started this business 3 months ago?..",

    "postText": "Day 3 of value drop. \n\nUse these businesses to inspire yourself for your next thing. Or just entertainment. \n\nIf you read my findings on day 1 and 2 you\u2019ll see a pattern. \n\nI like simple businesses with simple business models. \n\nSimple doesn\u2019t mean easy to execute but it\u2019s good to know that there are companies out there winning doing simple things. \n\nLet\u2019s dive \ud83d\udc47\n\n#1 - Howmanypedia. com \n\nThis site gets 1M visitors per month just writing about how many Xs are Ys.\n\nThey have articles like:\n- How many calories are in apples \n- How many Island does Croatia have \n- How many ounces in a gallon etc\u2026\n\nSimple, predictable content that can easily be found and outsourced.\n\nThey make money through display ads. \nWith 1M visitor I am estimating the site to be around $10K+ per month. \n\nCool side hustle that someone can copy\n\nOpportunities \ud83c\udf44\n\n1/ Make it an app that sends me one helpful educational notification every day\n\n2/ Turn it into a quiz app competition between friends (Potentially Viral) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#2 - AirPod Finder App making $13K a month\n\nFound this AirPod Finder app, making $13k/ month no advertisements. They\u2019re selling the app for $400K so was able to see their revenue. \n\nIt\u2019s just a team of 2. \n\nThe app simply helps you find your AirPod. \n\nIt\u2019s more accurate than the find my iPhone native app. (SIMPLE) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#3- Ammoseek. com\n\nThis site is simply a big aggregator of Ammo \ud83d\udd2b\n\nIt is just Search engine for ammunition. They just linking to other retailers. \n\nThis company has 1 employee! \n\nWhat they do is they scrape retailers and aggregate them in a searchable manner\n\nTraffic- 2.7M visits \n\nEstimating the site to be making at least $30K per month in ad revenue and affiliate fees \n\nThey\u2019re monetizing through affiliate fees and Ads.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHope you liked reading about these businesses. \n\nStay tuned for Day 4 Value Drop",

            "comment": "It's not remotely apples to apples, but here's a fun fact: in 2022, Apples AirPod revenue was roughly equivalent to Google's overall Cloud revenue (just over $22b).  Just goes to show how much potential there is in what might appear superficially to be niche and simple lines of business.",

    "postText": "**TLDR -** Lil Nas X was a college dropout sleeping on his sister\u2019s couch with a negative balance in his Wells Fargo account.  5 months later he'd broke Mariah Carey\u2019s record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1.   This post tells the story:\n\n**Part 1**\n\nMost musicians think like failed startups. Too much time creating. Not enough time promoting.\n\nWhen Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue music he didn\u2019t create much. Instead, he lived on Twitter, made online friends and got popular posting memes. His account quickly grew to 30,000 followers.\n\nThe plan was to use his following to promote his music. But it wasn\u2019t that simple. In Nas\u2019s words:\n\n*I\u2019d post a funny meme and get 2,000 retweets. Then I\u2019d post a song and get 10.*\n\nSo Nas got creative. He stopped tweeting SoundCloud links and started writing a song he could promote through memes. In his words:\n\n*It had to be short. It had to be catchy. It had to be funny.*\n\n*Old Town Road* was the result. And on the 3rd December 2018 Nas paired it with a video of a dancing cowboy and shared it with his followers ([see tweet](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1224708341064224773)).\n\nThe video went viral. So Nas stuck to this formula: Short viral videos. To the tune of Old Town Road. With the full song linked underneath.\n\nAs an unknown artist, it was the only way he could get the word out. And the views started piling up:\n\n**Part 2**\n\nInspired by *Old Town Road's* success on Twitter it spread to TikTok, and then onto Billboard\u2019s country music charts. Yes, the **country music charts**. Nas listed it as a country song aware that the charts were less competitive.\n\nOne week later Billboard removed it for \u201cnot being a country song\u201d. Ironically, this was the best thing that could have possibly happened. Billboard's decision turned *Old Town Road* into a national talking point and two weeks later it was No. 1.\n\nNas wasn't stopping. He began lining up remixes with some of music's biggest stars.\n\nBillboard has a loophole whereby remix plays count towards the original song's chart placement. With every remix millions more streams poured in, and *Old Town Road* became impossible to budge.\n\n17 weeks later he'd broke Mariah Carey\u2019s record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget quite what an extraordinary achievement this is. Five months earlier, Nas was a college dropout sleeping on his sister\u2019s couch with a negative balance in his Wells Fargo account.\n\n**Part 3**\n\nOn my first day researching Old Town Road I read a quote from Nas:\n\n*A lot of people like to say \u201ca kid accidentally got lucky\u201d. No. This was no accident.*\n\nThe more I learned about Nas the more I believed him.\n\nA key moment in *Old Town Road's* rise was a video of a man standing on a galloping horse going viral on Twitter. The audio was set to *Old Town Road*. Different versions of the video were viewed millions of times.\n\nI wanted to know how the video spread, so I did some digging and found it first posted on the 24th December: ([see tweet](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1224708356679577601))\n\nI asked the Twitter user why he made the video. He told me that Nas sent it to him. But it doesn't end there.\n\nAware that people watching the video would search for the full song, Nas changed the song title on YouTube and SoundCloud to include the lyric from the viral video \u2014 \u201cI got the horses in the back\u201d.\n\nHe also posted on the [NameThatSong](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/acakf0/i_got_the_horses_in_the_back/) subreddit which ranked on Google. Now, anyone searching from the video had an easy route to the song.\n\nThings didn\u2019t happen *to Nas*. Things happened *because of Nas*\n\nVirality is not mystical. The story of *Old Town Road* is not magical.\n\nLook behind the curtain: Nas is sitting in his underpants, on his sister's couch, iPhone in hand, making the whole thing happen.\n\nNo one knew him. No one wanted to check out his song. No one promoted anything for him.\n\nHe made friends, made them laugh, and built an audience. Then he packaged his song in a way that fit into their life. The rest is history.\n\nA final quote from Nas to end:\n\n*u can literally scroll down my account and see my promoting this fuckin song for months. each accomplishment it gets just makes all this shit feel so worth it. i can\u2019t stop taking about it.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThanks for reading.

            "comment": "Did you know that he made old town road song shorter than a regular song? He didn't include the last chorus, so naturally listeners will replay the song and only listen to the first chorus before skipping. The genius part is that a \"stream\" doesn't count as a stream unless it was streamed over 30 seconds. Guess how long is the chorus? A little over 30. So he basically doubled his streaming listens by this loophole.",

I remember when Gaga blew up her songs were all in that sweet spot then she did Bad Romance and Alejandro, both of which are roughly 4:30. You unpack their structure and you see how she made those pick up radio play: they\u2019re made of memorable ear worms rather than 1 or 2 so people can constantly cycle through them in their head. It also didn\u2019t hurt that she was on top of the world at that point, but those could have been way smaller hits and been career-closing had they not been so optimized for pop radio on both the American and global scale.",

Some songs you'd never listen to on their own but they are impossible to skip when listening to the full album.",

Ye was made in 2 weeks and is a very vulnerable project, so I don\u2019t think that was his ideology at all for making it 7 songs.",

So in the music video of the remix that has Billy Rae in it when they first roll up to the house and Lil Nas X makes the comment about how they treated him last time he was there, it's referring to how Billboard had bumped him. Then Billy Rae reassures him it'll be alright because now Lil Nas is with him, referring to the fact that now they can't bump you because I'm a household country name.\n\nThere are a few other small details in the video that have hidden meaning like that. Honestly, it was creative as hell.",

His daughter has been in the spotlight for almost the past 15 years, his younger daughter is also getting into the industry and he's just kind of drifting away into one-hit-wonder lands (yes, he isn't but to the general population he is mostly the guy who did Achey Brakey Heart and Hannah Montanas dad). \n\nNow he, again a country singer, is a huge part in creating one of the biggest and most succesful records ever in a time where hip-hop is dominating the charts and on a mostly trap-inspired track. He goes on to get back in the spotlight, reignite a fame of his own in an entirely new generation, perform on the biggest hip-hop festival stages in the world and win 2 grammys while at it. The entire story of OTR is just beautiful and that's why it's as huge as it is.",

It was suspended by Twitter at the same time as many other prominent accounts employing similar strategies, a network of tit-for-tat promotion known as \u201ctweetdecking,\u201d for the same reason.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Lil Nas X may seem like an overnight success, but his breakthrough is the product of a years-long, 21st-century marketing plan \u2014 one which has been banned from Twitter for its reliance on spammy tactics and copying others.\n\n---\n\nDon't get me wrong. I follow him, and he's very funny and down to earth, but his first step was absolutely without a shadow of a doubt to accumulate a large following through shady practices. 148,000 followers is *massive* in the world of comedy Twitter, and it's obvious that the song would become successful to some degree.\n\nIf there's anything to take away from this story, it's \"fake it 'til you make it\".",

Lil Nas worked to put himself in the position he was in, he prepared for it, then set the pieces in motion and capitalized on it. He intentionally put himself in the best position possible for \u201cluck\u201d to do its thing. If he hadn\u2019t done any of that work beforehand the song would be a dud because no one would hear it. He put his song in a position so that people could hear it. \n\nTalent is the second factor. Memes don\u2019t beat Mariah Carey\u2019s billboard #1 record, talent does. Talent gets him hundreds of millions (if not billions) of views/listens. He made a song that people would like, performed it well, and let his plan go to work. \n\nLil Nas\u2019s song took off because of talent, preparation, and execution. When talent, preparation, and execution meet luck it\u2019s like a multiplier effect. But if the work/product isn\u2019t good enough the multiplier ain\u2019t gonna be enough. You have to put yourself in the best position so that you can take advantage of a lucky situation, because they happen *all of the time* but nothing happens because no one prepared for it. \n\nMost social media music artists doing the \u201csame thing\u201d simply suck, and their plan and execution isn\u2019t as good as Lil Nas.",

It's ugly. If talent meant anything at all, the scene would be an entirely different thing. Talent means nothing in the music industry. There are literally thousands of more talented people than those who made it. Trust me.\n\nBehind every great artists you see, there is a room of 10 more talented people writing the songs and pitching them for peanuts.",

But I've worked with musicians before (sound engineer) and some are very talented on instruments but cannot make a song come together. Others cannot accept creative criticism and can't work with other people. And most can't make a song worthy of a radio edit. While these can all be great artists and they can be very talented in making epic songs, they didn't have an in towards reaching people with their music.\n\nSo yeah Mariah Carey got to #1 status but she was sort of also groomed into the music career, once someone recognized her talent of singing. To know someone's story like nasX is quite interesting since going viral is luck he kept trying... while others assume they post one tweet and it should be viral in an hour, and then look dumbfound on why Reddit didn't upvote a post.\n\nI even want to note he released it on Dec 3rd, around the time before families gather but kids are still in school. This gave it a chance to go viral on a small level and then spread as people in America travel, then he kept releasing more until Dec 24th. The timing of this even had to have some assistance IMO, as being at family gatherings and hearing cousins, uncles and etc talk about buzz feed crap others have seen that they enjoyed recently.",

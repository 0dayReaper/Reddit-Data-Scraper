We're talking anywhere from $10k to $10M and up to build \"an app\".\n\nYou need to include a bit more about what type of an app it would be, as well as what you're skillsets and budgets are.",

How long do you think it will take, and what would it cost for a human to survive for that time?\n\nSo, if you think it will take 2 months to build, which is a relatively short timeline for most full featured apps, expect to spend the cost of 2 months developer pay minimum. \n\nIf you have less than that, it will cost you more than that.",

            "comment": "I have multiple years of experience in building apps and websites. I have seen your comment that you think there is no app that does what you want to do. This is usually a sign of a) the idea is not good (no market) or b) your research is lacking. No competition is in my experience a very bad sign. So first I would start with validating the idea a bit more and find out who your users would be and talk with them. Understand what it is they want. Usually what you want is not necessary what your users want. You can't just hope that what you want is what your users want. This approach will lead to failure. Also find out why there is no app that does it yet.\n\nTake that knowledge and create some very very basic mockups for an MVP. Try to understand how big your app will be, how many screens you need and so on. Maybe hire a UX Designer to help you with that. Go back to your users and get feedback. Iterate this step a few times.\n\nWhile doing this understand what kind of app you want: android? ios? or maybe it would be better to create a web app? Will you need some kind of admin panel? \n\nAfter everything is more clear to you create some designs together with a UX-Designer. \n\nThen take all that knowledge and get offers for building an MVP from MULTIPLE dev companies. This way you will be able to understand the costs and technical effort required to build the app. \n\nKeep in mind that app development is not a linear progress. You will first build a simple minimal version. Get customer feedback. Improve. Release. Get Feedback. Release and so on. If you want to be successful you will iterate all of the time. \n\nNow if it is something small that can be easily done, maybe you can do it without a technical Cofounder. Otherwise I highly suggest to bring a technical Cofounder on board. The reason for that is very simple: It increases you success chance, it will save you lots of costs and also there is the marketing and sales side of things. IMO building an app is 20% engineering and 80% marketing and sales. \n\nGetting customers for your app is a whole different topic that I ignored here (there are other people on this sub who can give you much better advice on that) and doing the technical part and the marketing/ sales part alone is extremely difficult.\n\nEdit: I saw a comment mentioning building it yourself. Please don't. It will cost you a lot of time. Learning to code on a professional level takes multiple years.\n\nLow Code/ No Code Tools can be great for an MVP or to give your users something to play with. However please do not rely on such tools on the long term, in my experience this does not end well.",

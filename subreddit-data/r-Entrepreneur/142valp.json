    "postText": "We have been creating AI focused communities for some time and the goal would be to provide a platform but also a framework for investors, startup founders and mentors to work together in a positive cycle. There are startup accelerators of course, but these were developed for the pre-AI era. I think they are struggling to adapt to the new wave. Besides, they take your equity or your money. We would build something by the community for the community.\n\nWe are not just focused on entrepreneurship but also in research. We have communities also focused on AI subjects such as NLP or time series. We might get synergies also from the intersection of these communities in the near future as the timeframe of what is research today to what is a product tomorrow is quite quick these days. \n\nBottom line is that this is the time for creating new things and there are a lot of people deciding to pursue their ideas, their dreams and taking risks, so it makes sense to provide them with a background support. I think this wave is particularly different from the previous ones (e.g. crypto) because the macroeconomic environment is not very supportive of risky investments. So the money does not flow the same way, things take more time and these days you need traction ($ from users) to even get a pre-seed investment (two years ago a deck could give you $500k).\n\nAre there people interest in joining the team that is building this idea? We would need some community work, marketing and growth and maybe product and devs in the near future depending on progress. We want this to be free for founders, startups, investors, researchers, so think of it as opensource work.",

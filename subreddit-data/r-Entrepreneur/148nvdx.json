    "postText": "My family has been running an Italian specialty product store since 1982. When my grandfather first started it we were very fortunate and the business grew rapidly. We had expanded from just offering gelato to having a full service restaurant and cafe where we sold homemade pastas, sauces, desserts, paninis, etc. When my parents generation inherited it things continued to do well. However, things were taken for granted and no effort to expand/continue growing were made. Over time this had lead to a gradual but persistent decline. For example, we went from roughly $3 million annually around the 90s/early 2000's to barely hitting 800k now. \n\nAlthough this doesn't seem like the kind of business you'd want to get into I recently decided that I'd like to begin working there with my family. I had worked other jobs since graduating from university but felt as though my time would be better spent at the family business. I always believed, and still do, that the business could continue to flourish once again with some much needed refining and rejuvenation. \n\nMy real goal for the business to eventually switch a B2B approach where we would see our in house products to retailers, mom and pop shops. Boutiques etc. The main reason for this is that quite frankly I have no interest in all the things that go along with B2C sales (maintaining a store front, doing table service, intensity of social media, taxing hours, etc.)\n\nFrom this limited stage however it can be hard to see how I can successfully make this switch. Any suggestions, recommendations, examples are appreciated!",

Authentic, high-quality food products can do very well if they're marketed properly, and your company has a family history that might play well with an audience. WRT B2B, I'm not sure how it works, but I know that Whole Foods has some kind of a program where they put local small business goods on their store shelves; for example, the stores in DC sell mumbo sauce.",

I guess what I mean by I'm not interested in the B2C is  that working so directly with your clients (counter/table service) is a whole different beast I'm not willing to deal with.",

You could get some kind of white label storefront solution, and pay for a designer to make it look nice, maybe have some ad copy about your company's history. You could also try selling through Amazon, although they'd take a cut, naturally.",

They've been on several Food Network shows and celebs visit often. Another Italian Market opened in the neighboring town recently and there's more than enough business to go round. You should see what they're doing right and emulate. B2C is the way to go.",

    "postText": "I would like to start a subscription box for my small business. We are already a successful bakery for small pets (like rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.) and I believe that adding this facet to our offerings will open us up to many new customers. One thing I am struggling to understand are just some logistics of subscription boxes:\n\n1. How do you know how much of each product to order that is included in the box? How do you avoid over-ordering or, more importantly, under-ordering. Unless you have a limit on the number of boxes that are available each month, I would worry that we would run out of products. I imagine that you could do a pre-order for the initial launch to get somewhat of an idea of how many people will sign up at first and then just keep an eye on growth over time. And maybe start the first few months off with products that you know you can easily get more of quickly if need be?\n2. We have a Shopify website but what are the best apps for starting a subscription box service?\n3. How do you manage having retail products in addition to a subscription box? For example, what if a customer is on our website to do some shopping and add some treats to their cart. But then they also notice the subscription box and want to sign up for that at the same time so they add that to their cart too. Do you just make the subscription box so that it can't be combined with other items in shipment?\n4. How do you manage when you ship boxes out and when the deadline is for signing up for that particular month's box? For example, do you make the cut-off for February's box sometime in mid-January? Is that enough buffer time? And when do you ship February's box? At the end of January so they get it the beginning of Feb? Or mid-month? What is best practice?\n\nThank you in advance for any advice you may have!!",

            "comment": "As someone who loves to receive subscription boxes in the mail, I can tell you that a lot of companies will send out surveys to their subscribers beforehand to determine their preferences and avoid over or under-ordering. It may also be helpful to include seasonal products that can be easily restocked. As for the best apps for Shopify, Cratejoy is a great choice. And typically, you would want to ship out boxes at the end of the month and set the cut-off date a few days before. Good luck with your venture!",

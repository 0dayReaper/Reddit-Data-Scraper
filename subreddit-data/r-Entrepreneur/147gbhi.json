    "postText": "I've started taking on work again, developing websites and web applications in PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My new website is https://logicsmith.uk. I was hoping for feedback on the website, content and services mentioned. \n\nI'm wondering who I should be targeting and what content I should have on the website. \n\nI wanted to capitalise on the brand image, using images that embody craftsmanship facets of a blacksmiths. I don't know if I went too far, making imagery depart from programming websites and web apps, or not far enough, departing from the brand image. \n\nI tried to list a fairly comprehensive range of services, I don't know if I listed too many or not enough. I don't really know who I'm targeting; just anyone with a need for programming/design in the areas mentioned.\n\nI want to refine the website before I start PPC advertising. I was wondering if I should have specific landing pages targeting specific needs of specific groups of users, rather than just having a catch-all page listing all services. But maybe having a wide range of services listed would give people confidence that my services are flexible?\n\nI haven't included a portfolio since the work I've done doesn't lend itself to a portfolio. I'm wondering if that's a problem and what to do about it",

Before using any advertising to direct people into the website, I'd suggest thinking about what you want people to get out of the website. \n\nWhat would be the reason they'd come to your site, what do they get out of it. \n\nAlso understand your customer's challenges and try addressing how you'd solve them instead of just listing your services. \n\nIn terms of design,  the site needs a lot of improvements. Can help with that if you are into working with a designer.",

Understanding your audience and defining their problems to solve would allow you to think more clearly.\n\nBut also, you need to consider usability principles. Making the text on the website more readable, less distracting interactions and better navigation. Visual design is an area you can definitely improve on the current website.\n\nI offer UX design services in the UK, which combines both customer-centric design and visual design principles and I am open to discussing more details.\n\nI am preparing a special offer for founders here. It might be a good option for you too, if you want to invest in a better experience for reaching your audience. DM me if interested.",

The dark text on the homepage images is a little hard to read, the '5 stars' images look a bit basic, and the images on the Services page don't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nYour list of services is really extensive, it's great that you can offer so much help to your clients! I'm wondering if the writing is a little too 'techy' though - I often find with my clients that I have to cut out as much jargon as possible and focus more on the benefits of the services rather than the features. If your audience is tech-savvy though it might be fine for them!",

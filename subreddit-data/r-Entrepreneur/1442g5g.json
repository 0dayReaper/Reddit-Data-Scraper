    "postText": "I (27f) do websites as an online gig. The majority of my work is based on WordPress templates - basically just changing some pictures and text. I used to work very efficiently and just swap things out, would take me a couple of hours max to deliver the product and make a very good amount of money for being this productive. My clients never complained about anything and were always happy with the product. \n\n\nNowadays, after doing this for over a year, I have observed myself becoming more and more \"obsessed\" and \"perfectionist\" with my websites - much less productive and efficient as I used to be. For example, I'd hyperfocus for over a day on adding custom CSS to make this cool title image animation because I think it would look really cool on the landing page - even if the client paid for a very basic product. Or I would spend days altering the basic template \"to make it fit to the client\" to a point where it's become unusable and I have to do everything from scratch again (haha rip) just because I wanted \"to do better\" than \"before\". \n\nI see myself being blocked by myself and my obsession \"to do better than my previous project\" - but it's taken a toll on my productivity (=income) and my overall mental health \"gotta do better! gotta impress the client! this can be improved!\". Do I care too much? What is going on? On a side note (important I believe) I have diagnosed ADHD and am taking medication (Vyvanse). I apologize for potential grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. \n\nHave you been at my place? How did you tackle this problem? What worked for you? \n\nThank you all in advance for support, stories and advice!",

Suitable for promotional video's with close ups. \n\nI thought most of the clients for this sort of orders would go for level 1, the first one I offered the choice went for level 3. I guess seeing the difference also helps.",

Would the design changes you are proposing and adding up can be measured in terms of return of investment both by the client and your time?\n\nBy asking these kinds of questions, you can prioritise your focus to finish what is needed, then offer a support service where you can tweak and improve upon with tracking and testing your improvements. This way, you wouldn't feel like the time you spend on design improvements get wasted and know what things are necessary and what doesn't need more time to polish.\n\nIf you want to improve the visual language of your client's brands and interfaces, you can also work on improving your UX strategy and UI design skills, which would allow you to offer services beyond WordPress templates and pictures and text, as you'd be able to demonstrate the reasons behind your design choices.",

It's great that you want to deliver a quality product, but remember that your clients are paying for your time and expertise, not for a perfect website. Take a step back and ask yourself if the extra time and effort you're putting in is worth it. Maybe set a time limit for each project or try working with a friend to hold you accountable.

Making a number of websites per unit of time. Maybe you could try focusing on volume instead of the perfect fit?\nOr, if that's the way you want to grow, charge more and perhaps accept the reduction in volume for improvement in quality. Could you quantify the time it takes you to complete higher quality projects? You could balance the $ amount from lower quality-higher volume websites to higher quality-lower volume websites.",

    "postText": "I just transferred to UCLA as a data theory major. I have my own tech startup already and made some money interning at google, but I feel a lot of pressure to switch my major to computer science. \n\nIt will take me 1 year to finish my degree in data theory.\n\nBut could take 2 to 3 more years to switch into computer science because the requirements are insane.\n\nI know that a computer science degree is not at ALL necessary if I want to be a tech entrepreneur, but I keep being swayed into wanting to do this.\n\nI should just stick with the data theory route right?",

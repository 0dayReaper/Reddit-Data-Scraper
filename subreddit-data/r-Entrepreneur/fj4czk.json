Once they can no longer afford to buy out the stores, the shelves will just fill up again leaving people who bought them out with a shit ton of supplies that they won't be able to resell at retail prices.",

I hope his 80K was worth losing his ability to make a living. Amazon is especially ruthless when it bans you. You can't just make another account to sell, they have all your financial data and personal info required to start a seller account. Unless you can create another real world identity, you are screwed.",

Not only will they ban you but bring their legal team in to crush you for trying to circumvent them. In the online game sellers are dust and buyers are gold.

So I went to PetCo and bought *literally the same chemical*, Praziquantel, for $60 with no prescription; didn't even show ID. \n\nI didn't realize prescriptions restrict access to medicine based on *who it is for* and are not actually related to the chemical itself... \n\nLook it up: does Praziquantel require a prescription? \n\nThen go to PetCo and buy it without one. \n\nWe need to make a law requiring that entities demonstrate a clear, obvious, and real danger of abuse to put medicine behind a prescription pay-wall; otherwise it should be illegal to put barriers between people and medicine.",

How could someone be angry at Martin Shkrelli when what he did was no different than what every other pharmaceutical company does? You can go to Cuba and buy an inhaler for pennies! you can go to Canada and prescription drugs are cheap as well! Why does the USA jack up the prices of things and call it business?\n\nWhat I fail to understand, how is price gouging different than retail arbitrage? Is it because it is a \"need?\" in that case, why do we not have universal healthcare? Why do we not have UBI? \n\nIf the banks and business owners are allowed to be corrupt, why does it stop short of the people? \n\nI want to make it clear I am not defending price gouging, but instead I am posing the bigger question which is why do we not question the status quo which is just as corrupt as what you're discussing?",

She mixed up a big batch of 2/3 rubbing alcohol and one third hand lotion. She folded paper towels and put them in the containers. She then poured in some of the alcohol / lotion mix. She put the lids on and sold them over the weekend on a little folding card table outside her house for $2 each. it didn't actually work great because the hand lotion kind of curdled up like sour milk and didn't mix well with the alcohol but they were still disinfecting hand wipes and the lotion still moisturize your alcohol dried out hands.",

There is no \"not affected\" area for what's going on right now.\n\nBut, if you're buying goods in Oklahoma to bring to the hurricane-stricken coast of, say, Texas where people have to drive far out of the area to get essentials (if they can get out at all), I don't have a big issue with it. In that situation, it's not the resellers that have created the shortage. There's a legitimate supply problem that needs to be solved and the ability to resell is a good way to encourage people to bring in those supplies from outside those affected areas.\n\nBuying up all the supplies in an adversely affected area to resell them in the ***same*** area makes you an asshole. You artificially created a shortage of necessary goods to profit. Driving in items from hundreds of miles away and helping relieve a legitimate shortage in the adversely affected area is a different thing.\n\nBuying items during a nationwide panic up so you can resell them on Amazon, eBay, or any other online platform also makes you an asshole.",

It depends on many circumstances, which makes this post a blanket condemnation because it considers none of them.  \n\nIf I sell a 48 pack of TP less than a store would charge for 6 rolls (price per roll), than I am actually solving a problem and adding value. \n\nIt's just the ignorant people that see TP for sale and flag  the ad on Facebook that are truly the problem. They have just interrupted me helping someone, while supplying them with what they need, \n\nIt's the knee-jerk reactions of the overly emotional, who can't calmly read a post without irrationally having a tantrum, that are getting in the way of a business with ethics, helping a consumer.  Some may be exploiting people but others may not. But they assume all people selling TP are exploiting people.  Much like the poster of this thread did.  He felt it was his duty to come to the entrepreneur thread to lecture people selling items in high demand, and admonish them for selling items in high demand.  It is this kind or irrational thinking that is fueling fear and affecting economic markets.  Perhaps these are the people that should stay silent, and let the buyer decide for himself if he wants to purchase the item, or wait.   Meanwhile, I'll sell a 48 pack of TP for less than a store charges for 6 roll (price per roll) all day long, if people would stop interfering with me providing a product to those in need.

    "postText": "Call me narcissistic or worse, but it's just how I feel.\n\nI'm actually humble and nice towards others. I definitely don't feel the need to use others or have power over others.\n\nBut I hate others having power over me. \n\nMy independence is so, so important to me. Even with a \"good boss\", I hate the dynamic of being an underling, a subordinate, an employee.\n\nI don't even really want to have other employees. My ideal business would be just me doing my thing all alone. Hell, sometimes I feel like what I really want isn't entrepreneurship but living in the woods somewhere, although that's very uncomfortable and unfeasible for me personally, so entrepreneurship  is sort of the only path towards a comfy, solitary, independent life. Now if I only could find an idea that works for me, but that's another matter entirely.",

It is so deeply engrained into the work culture that there is little chance of \"it\" changing. \n\nPart of the problem you are facing is your passiveness. You say \"if only i could find\" That my friend is the very thinking and language that has your tail tickling your nose and will have you stuck for many years. Could be a continuous spiral, because you will grow more and more resentful and unfulfilled. \n\nThe trick is to take full agency in yourself and choose a path and approach everything with a goal and purpose. The only thing you will ever actually possess is your mind and body. Every job is an opportunity to improve your core skills and gain new knowledge and network. Find a way to be an Intrapraneur wherever you work and use every opportunity to get really good at whats at hand while planning for your future. The way to rise above is to become a badass at whatever you do and to do it relentlessly. Fuck the politics and how you are treated, create growth goals wherever you are and attain them. Make one inch of progress alwyas and you will find yourself miles down the road later. \n\nIf you have your own clear purpose at any job, the bullshit will loose its power. You will know that you are gaining what you want no matter what. That you are building inherent value in what you can do in this world.\n\nDo you hobbies first as though you want to teach them, then as to be the best in the world.\n\nStrive constantly so that the muscles of striving grow strong. \n\nIts actually all inside of you. I have trained myself to waste no time lamenting the shitty things. I live to overcome them and out do everyone and everything around me.\n\nStop looking for the magic bullet and own that it is all in your hands.\n\nChange your language from, \"if only\" to \"i am going to find a way to make the life i want\"\n\nIf you say that every day, you will find the path opening. You will spend your mental energy in movement and growth, not in self sabotaging emotions. You are giving your power to a nebulous system and its been in your hands the whole time.  \n\n\nDon't be attached to outcomes or expectations, do the work. The work always gets you somewhere. You will find yourself growing stronger in little ways and your sense of purpose will expand slowly. Its not easy and it takes time and consistent effort. \n\nShoot for the sun, you will find yourself walking on the moon. No one in the history of this earth has accomplished their perfect vision of life.  \n\nTrain yourself to never give up.",

There are definitely hard times, and days I drag my butt out the door, but overall, I wouldn't change much!\n\nHow did I get here? I put in the work. Every job I EVER had has taught me valuable skills. I worked schlepping donuts while in school, and found a way to enjoy enough of that that I was promoted into management once I graduated (it's the customer piece that I thrive on TBH). I spent years learning to manage people, in increasingly larger and busier and more complicated jobs, from donuts to fast food, retail.and warehouse. I took every seminar and training course offered with eagerness, and learned a crap ton from my own bosses (good and bad!). I spent my time in the trenches and when entrepreneurship became a viable option, I was way ahead of the curve in terms of experience with customer service (and various levels of autonomy, policy and backup from above along the way), juggling priorities, discovering my own strengths and weaknesses (sometimes it just makes sense to pay the person who is good at the thing you arent) etc.  I didn't know I was laying a foundation for this, but it sure became a solid one, and I have honestly been suprised at how many times even that donut job became relevant at this one (completely different industry!)\n\nI had some really awful jobs. One was auto parts delivery. Hated it, left as soon as something more solid came along. Use some of that knowledge pretty much daily. Also tried hostessing at a restaurant- got told I was \"too informal\"- used that little bit of self knowledge in some of the basic planning for my business.  \n\nI've worked as a carpenters assistant, at a catering company serving and doing dishes, In a convenience store, at an ice cream shop, in a print place, in a book store, in a butcher room of a grocery store in, as a babysitter, in a retail main warehouse, and in retail clothing. And EVERY single job has taught me something that has been valuable along the way.\n\nSometimes working for others does suck, but a smart person will take that opportunity to absorb everything useful along the way, while also pavung their own path to something better.  I was once headhunted off the cash register at McDs into a retail.management position at the local mall. She would have hired me to work in the store no matter what, but when she saw responsibility in my resume (I was working below my qualifications after a bad life shift), she immediately offered me the higher position.  Based on my customer service while slinging burgers. Because in EVERY job, I made it a point to find a way to love what I did, even if I was slapping on a smile rather than smacking a terrible boss or taking personal offense at a snarky customer. \n\nI love your take on it u/wayofghehand, thanks for articulating it so well :)",

I don't hate working, and I don't hate people, I just hate working in conjunction with other people, whether that's being managed, managing others, or even having any sort of customer/client-type interactions. My ideal life is producing things on my own schedule that make money without the necessity of answering to anyone else, including customer/client expectations or deadlines. It's farfetched, because I think almost every money-making venture generally has to include *some* level of acquiescing to someone, because the exchange of making money usually includes at some point a transaction in which someone will expect something out of you in terms of time and quality, and your ability to continue working depends on meeting those expectations. Even as a completely freelance artist, say, you still have to meet the expectations of whoever is paying you, even if that means advertisers on your YouTube channel. You can live in the woods and make furniture all day long for money, but at some point, you still have to have the exchange of trading your furniture to customers for their money, which still ends up necessitating that you are being \"managed\" by the expectations set up by needing to fulfill customers' needs.\n\nThe one prominent thing I can really think of that bends this expectation is being an independent investor and purely having an income based on earnings from investments\u2014there's no exchange in doing that that necessitates you providing someone else with anything (not in the sense of producing a finished product or devoting your time, anyway). But you may as well call yourself a professional gambler in that scenario\u2014not to say it can't be done.\n\nI think about this topic a lot. Since I don't think I have the constitution to be a daytrader, I rack my brain thinking of scenarios where I can make money without being subjected to *anyone* else's requirements of me, and I draw blanks. (Practically) every source of income imaginable always requires being someone's subordinate, whether it's a boss, a client, or a customer.",

I far prefer being an entrepreneur.",

All of them earned me enough money to live comfortably, but definitely not luxuriously.  Those businesses were:\n\n1.  Spray on truck bed liner business.  \n2. Commercial janitorial business.  \n3. Printed circuit board assembly, electrical panel wiring , electro-mechanical assembly business.   \n4. Door to door advertising flyer business (not recommended, although good exercise).  \n5. Apartment complex door to door trash pick up business.  \n\nSome of these businesses I owned simultaneously.  Those businesses required light to medium physical effort.  They all required hustle.  I was always looking for the next customer, as were my competitors, and you will always have competitors.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some sales/marketing suggestions and tips I wrote for nephew when he got in to the Real Estate Agent business:\n\nThe Hustle, Your Hustle\r.  Success is in the hustle.\r  \n\r  \nSuccess is in the details. \r  \n\r  \nSuccess is not owned, it's leased, and the rent is due every day.\r  \n\r  \nYou can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want a successful business, you must sell.  You must hustle.  You must \"knock on doors\" and ask for business.  Leave no door un-knocked, even the scary ones.  When you knock on enough scary doors, they stop being scary. Business will not come looking for you, you must go look for it.  Business is all around you, yours for the taking if you reach for it.  \r  \nEven the people at the top go in search of their next customer, they are relentless and persistent and they never stop improving their craft and they never miss a door.  Whatever your business is, you must put yourself out there for people to choose you, because they're going to choose someone. \r  \n\r  \nCompanies/entrepreneurs succeed or fail by how well they manage all the details.  All the details, not just the easy or obvious details.  If there's a detail you're avoiding, it's the most important detail to gain control of.  When you control that detail, move to the next challenging detail. Be the master of the details in your life.  If you don't, someone else will, and you won't like how they control your details.\r  \n\r  \nActively seek hustle opportunities.  They really are everywhere, and that's where you have to be.  There are trillions of dollars flowing worldwide, your entry point is anywhere you chose to enter the market, step in to the stream and work the hell out of it.  There are as many entry points as there are dollars.\r  \n\r  \nLook for persons wearing branded business apparel.  Pass your card.  Ask for business.  If you don't, someone else will.\r  \n\r  \nPass your card at every opportunity.  Ask for their business.  If you don't, someone else will.  Never be caught without a business card.\r  \n\r  \nCan you successfully withstand a technical challenge from an expert in your own field?  There are people in the business world that will challenge your knowledge to determine your worthiness to work on their product or service or provide a product or service to them.  Those people have the technical knowledge to create and maintain their own  but don't have the time/inclination (but do have plenty of resource$) to do that and are willing pay a professional to do that task for them, but to get their trust/business you must prove your technical chops and prove it quickly because time is money to these people.  These are the guys/gals that you'll encounter in unlikely places that will in less than a minute be able to make an accurate determination of your skill level.  It's also a meeting to determine social/emotional compatibility. \r  \n\r  \nThe initial emotional/social connection you make with the potential customer is a critical part of capturing their business.  That happens in the first minute, after that, it's all about your technical chops.\r  \n\r  \nDo you have an \"elevator pitch\"?  You must have one.  Have a ten second pitch, a thirty second pitch and a one minute pitch.  You can pack a lot of information in to those three lengths of time.  Also, a compelling ten second pitch can easily turn in to a one minute or more pitch.  Be ready to sell and close. \r  \n\r  \nYou will be judged, almost immediately and for a long time after.  What you wear, your demeanor, your words and how you say them, what you produce (or don't produce), everything.  There's no escaping judgement, we all do it to each other at the social, emotional and business level.  Use that human behavior to your advantage. \r  \n\r  \nNo passion, no money. \n\nI currently work as an employee, but I hate my bosses, worse bosses ever.  I'm thinking about starting yet another business.  Possibly something along the lines of small scale parking lot paint striping and related services to commercial customers (I prefer commercial customers rather than residential customers).",

It's also just plain more rewarding to create and grow something and reap the benefits of your own hard work.\n\nAs to narcissism being a trait in entrepreneurs, I'm pretty sure it is..  IIRC, founders, CEOs and such generally show more Narcissism than the average person.. that being said, narcissism is a spectrum and having some selfish traits isn't a bad thing when you want to succeed.  In my opinion, it only becomes negative when it's significantly to the detriment of others around you.",

You'll have customers, vendors, and possibly partners to work with. Often you won't get to call all the shots in those situations, which might make you feel like their subordinate. And maybe you are to some extent, but sometimes you have to compromise for the sake of the relationship.",

    "postText": "All right maybe this is annoying or dumb, but I'm completely stumped and figure maybe someone here can give me ideas.\n\nLong story short, got divorced and eventually lost my job due to my post-divorce misery.\n\nI'm an extremely good worker -- like \"the best worker we have,\" everywhere I've worked -- and I simply don't want to keep wasting this ability making money for a company while being broke. I am really intelligent and love having lots to think about so I know I'd do well running a business.\n\nHowever I'm not good with social affairs. Like I have social anxiety so bad that I don't even answer the phone when my mom calls, I have to prepare myself for a conversation and then call her back.\n\nMy most prominent skill is steel fabrication. Anything pertaining to metal, I'm excellent at it. But I have zero idea how I could use this skillset to start a successful business. Like nobody buys swords anymore lol so being a blacksmith isn't practical. Bodywork on vehicles is annoying and doesn't make anybody wealthy. I've been racking my brain trying to figure something out, but I swear I'm like Ozzy Osborne since the divorce, just completely confused all the time like 50% of my brain just doesn't work anymore because of stress idk.\n\nAnybody got any ideas as to what kind of steel work I could do, that could be successful in today's world?",

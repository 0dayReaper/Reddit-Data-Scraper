If people don't do what they're asked to do, by the time I want it done we have a conversation. If it becomes habitual, then they're fired.

One of which paid it's workers by the hour, one of which paid it's workers by the job. \n\nThe people who paid by the job usually in my experience completed on average 2 jobs in a day. The people who get paid by the hour usually only completed 1 job a day. \n\nThese jobs were all inputting telecommunications into new houses and were all pretty straightforward, but time consuming because often a road had to be dug up and so forth. \n\nOn the surface it seemed great to be paying by the job because the workers completed so many more jobs right? However the issue was that the culture was quantity over quality, and frequently teams had to return to jobs to fix mistakes and so forth, and they cut corners with many things most importantly workplace safety e.g. not setting up appropriate barricades because they just wanted to get in and out.\n\nThe team that was paid by the hour produced top quality work. Yes they probably took twice as long to finish a job, but the culture there was attention to detail. They never in my experience had to return to job sites to fix mistakes. \n\nI have no idea what was better for profits, or how the pay of the workers varied (I was a contractor so I was on a different payment system which was hourly based) but I know I MUCH preferred working with the people who got paid per hour, they and the management were much more laid back. The people who got paid per job would often skip lunch breaks and just eat quickly in the car between work sites and work longer hours to try and finish as many jobs as possible in a week.",

You can command a higher level of performance. But sometimes stuff does happen. My three hour ceiling fan install turned into 7 the other day lol. And I didn't even get the fan box set. Just hung a light to get out of their house and will have to come back later and install a fan box.",

I don't know how many guys they claimed but maybe they added more men on the first day or maybe they were just faster. You knew the final cost, $200 a day plus X workers over Y days, equals total cost. Once you say, yes that total cost is agreeable to me, then what does it matter how fast the work is done, as long as it meets or beats the time allotted?  Would you have paid more if it ended up taking more time for them to paint? What if it the quoted 3 days but it took 5, would you pay more because they took longer? The only way to be upset in your example is if you were going to pay more for them to take longer.",

My CEO doesn\u2019t micromanage and gives me free reign to use the time and resources to accomplish what\u2019s asked (which is always reasonable).\n\nHe lets us do our own thing while working (music, phone, movies) and buys us lunch occasionally. \n\nWhen I interviewed for the position, I expressed how as an early 20s, recent(ish) grad that I think entrepreneurship is the end goal for me. He took the chance on me and offers insight when I ask for advice on my current business. \n\nThe mutual respect we have for each other inspires me to work hard. I work an extra 10 hours a week (which he\u2019s happy to pay for), and I\u2019ve made great developments that have put us in a great place for his goal of scaling.\n\nSome may take advantage of that kindness, but I\u2019m optimistic that the right talent will step up and appreciate it.",

Sometimes it takes a year or two, but when this happens it can become often become insidious as those individuals will generally start letting their team down, causing a bit of a chain reaction. I've seen this happen on multiple occasions, and it's a reason why a lot of managers have been trying to push workers back to the office. Unfortunately all it takes is the minority to ruin things for the majority. \n\nDespite this I still believe in giving team members trust and autonomy within the bounds of goals and objectives, but you need to also verify that everyone on the team are being honest about their contributions and keep communication flowing. I perhaps have been guilty of not communicating enough with team members, and something I'm working on. The moment an individual breaks trust, you need to have a frank conversation with them as soon as possible to avoid it becoming a problem. I think it's also important to make this clear from the start to avoid it becoming a problem in the first place.",

Cool I don't care he's on his phone..)\n\nBUT:\n\n* If you do not know how long a task should take (i.e. you brought in a subject-matter expert) then **you're relying on them to tell you how long things take**.\n* What if your subject matter expert is giving you heavily padded timelines on how long things take? Like turning a 6 hour job into a 3 day job so they can work a 2nd or 3rd job remotely or simply to \"shop on amazon or watch netflix\", meanwhile you're paying them for full time work. Would you consider this honest/dishonest? Let me know your thoughts.\n* Unless your business is ultra-high-profit and shielded with strong network effects, patents, or other things like that then you probably have competition. If your competition is 3-4x as labor efficient as yours because their employees have the same output-per-hour but work an actual 8 hours per day versus a 1-2 hours and 5-6 hours of netflix, you're going to be outcompeted. Both on speed and on cost/pricing. This is just reality. Then you'll fail and no one will have jobs in your enterprise.\n\nSo this again to me seems to come down to a cherry picked situation where:\n\n* the employee has a fixed amount of repetitive work to do per day\n* you know how long it takes the average person to do it\n* and there isn't a multi-day backlog of work to be done.\n\nIn that case, sure if the employee finishes all the work for the day and browses the internet for hours on end... well duh. I mean what else will they do? **Plus you're the one who bought the employee's time and have no work to allocate to it, so isn't that on you?** Who would be mad about that?\n\nBut in the situation where you bring in an expert and are relying on their honesty to drive forward a critical business outcome and now they're giving you 1/4th-1/3rd the time they agreed to be paid for when you hired them, that doesn't have the same happy-go-lucky feel does it?\n\nThere is some huge anti-employer sentiment on Reddit, and understandably so. Wages have stagnated and workers are getting sick of not being able to afford to live. So this will ruffle feathers, but let me know where my understanding is lacking here. This doesn't seem nearly as clear-cut as OP's original post.\n\nOP, also let me know how many years of experience you have in managing people, because if you don't have any experience just know that not everyone is honest and a lot of people will try to take advantage of your trust.\n\n*EDIT: I genuinely want to discuss, this is supposed to be an entrepreneurial subreddit. Let's talk and learn. You don't need to agree, but please don't drive-by downvote and leave no value behind. State your perspective.*",

But, if someone needs to call off for an emergency or the team is otherwise delayed, now you may go past the projected time which looks bad and causes other problems. So it makes sense to keep your timelines to customers reasonable.\n\nIf you care less about trimming all \"wasted\" time possible and care more about developing a long-standing team which you can rely on and are happy. Giving them an opportunity to work extra fast when it's possible and be rewarded for it with some free time (PTO essentially) or some other incentive, it builds a sense of respect and appreciation. Plus, it doesn't change the expected profit from when the job was accepted.\n\nNow like you said, if you're in a business with constant production, that works a little differently but there's always ways to create an incentive for someone doing extra work one day without punishing them for doing a normal amount the next day.\n\nAs for bringing a subject matter expert in... if you hire someone to do X per week for Y dollars, and they do X in 3 days, I don't think you should get upset by that. When you hire them you agree that X tasks per week is worth Y Dollars and that doesn't change if they're capable of doing more than that. There's not really anywhere else in life you would pay for something and then expect for it to overperform what you agreed to at the start.\n\nI think that like all things, there is a high degree of variability here, but overall if you can reward any exceptional work, even with something as simple as letting them fuck around for a little bit, they will appreciate it and be happier and more productive. There just needs to be caution that it's not abused, but that comes down to mutual respect and communication.",

Your ACTUAL job as an executive of your own business is to inspire productivity in your employees. And you do that by implementing humane policies that focus on work/ life balance, paying them well, and empowering employees to discover what works best for them within the parameters of their role, and when/what/how they are most productive. \n\nKnow this: if you're employing other people to drive the success of your fledgling business, then you are building a business *on their backs.* You couldn't do it without them. Every single task they do takes something off your table and frees you up to do other tasks vital to growing your business. Therefore every endeavour successfully accomplished happened *because of them*. Guess who the most important people in your company are. Not the management, not the director. The employees. \n\nI don't ever want to read discussions about \"differences between 'high value' Vs 'low value' employees\" again here. How precisely do you measure the value of other people? Should you? What actually matters to productivity is skills and knowledge. Skills and knowledge are where the true value is that will drive sustainable, long term success, and are what most companies can not do without for long.",

    "postText": "Probably the wrong place to put this but I figured this is the only place that would understand my problem. I am ambitious as fuck. I am ambitious to the point that I constantly have multiple plate spinning and am working CONSTANTLY. I'm never not working, planning, or analyzing where things failed or did better. I'm at the point now where its like... I don't have enough time. I have got to get X goal done because I'm going to die any day and then time's up.\n\nSeriously. In 5 years I've published 17 books. I've made THOUSANDS of videos on YouTube across like 5 different genres. Gaming, Reactions, News commentaries, regular commentaries, rants etc. Livestreams 7 days a week on those channels as they rose and fall. \n\nThe channels get banned, I immediately make another one and throw up the archives and go back to the grind. In 6 months alone I made 400+ videos before giving up on that channel and going back to another brand name which blew up then got banned because youtube fucking sucks and protects pedos (show was about to catch a predator).\n\nI now run a youtube channel, a book publishing company, a computer repair shop, and an ebay store none of which are working out... I'm going fucking NUTS at this point. It's this constant drive to \"make it big\" or be comfortable in life financially to the point its like an obsession... Is anyone else this bad?",

Put all that time and effort into one bussiness and one bussiness only. Go deep, not wide. If you specialize you become the guy who is undeniably trustworthy in your niche and you will have stepbacks of course, but persist and in the long run you will come out positive.\nYou should only pursue other ideas when you have too much free time and your income from your first bussiness is enough to be invested.\n\nSorry for my english",

Make a list with a couple \"pros/cons\", it will not make for the final choice but it will help you to have a bigger picture and not feel overwhelmed. And I say a couple days because with time stuff will pop up in your mind to add to that list. \n\nCompletely important and very nice advice about this choice making thingy: in that list put (big and coloured) \"I like this one the most!!\" in the one that (you guessed it) you like the most, even if at first it doesnt seem to be the most profitable. \n\nTake this oportunity to step towards the path of enjoying your work!!!",

What I read is a story of someone who wants to keep busy and hopes that someday some money may come out of it, despite seeing efforts fail and then doing the exact same thing again. \n\nAmbition is having a crystal clear vision as your dot on the horizon to guide your choices, a strategy in the form of a concrete plan to get there, and action in the form of only doing those things that will actually move you towards making your vision become reality (and dropping everything else that isn\u2019t helping you achieve that). \n\nShooting blanks isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere. You write it yourself: \u201cnone of which are working out\u201d. Just wanting a shitload of money isn\u2019t a vision, and just working really hard all the time isn\u2019t a strategy.  \n\nGive yourself a proper break to focus on what you really want, and to develop a vision and strategy. Find help for that if you don\u2019t know where to start. And also get some help to keep you on track once you\u2019ve got your vision and strategy, to help you avoid falling back into the same traps over and over again.",

Making thousands of videos for youtube channels that get banned isn't a flex, it's masturbation.\n\nNone of your shit is working out.\n\nEver take a minute from your busy schedule to try to figure out why?\n\nIt's because none of your projects have any competitive edge or any barriers to entry, and there's no sign that you're offering any significant value for your services. \n\nLiterally anybody reading this thread who wanted to could start a publisher/youtube channel/computer repair shop/ebay store by the end of next week.\n\nStop thinking about your own greed for five minutes and figure out what you can offer that people will be willing to pay a premium for. If you can't think of anything, think of things that people ARE willing to pay a premium for that you would be interested in developing the skills to offer.\n\nThat's literally how the free market works. Buy and Sell. Supply and Demand.\n\nYou have to develop products and services that there's a demand for, that isn't already saturated.\n\nThat's where you should be investing your time right now, not just wantrepreneuring your way in ten different directions to look busy.",

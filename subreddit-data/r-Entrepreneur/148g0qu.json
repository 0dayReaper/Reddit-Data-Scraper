    "postText": "Hello all, \nI've started a youtube channel where I do virtual property tours of real estate properties in Italy. So far is going decently well. Currently, I'm acting as the content creator and hence I'm just passing the leads to the real estate agency. The ultimate goals is of course to earn a commission on a sale. I'm trying to find a tool that would allow me to:\n- Direct the customer to an external site where basic information are collected\n- Transfer the information to the real estate agency\n- Keep track of the sale journey\n\nAdmittedly I'm not the best at finding the product for me, I was wondering if someone here could help?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "I wanted to expand on my previous post about the \u2018key to manifesting\u2019 (I\u2019m a woo woo man what can I say) being this: DON\u2019T FUCKING TELL ANYONE WHAT YOU\u2019RE DOING!\n\nI truly believe this is the secret sauce: when you tell people about your new project, there are two main scenarios that can play out \u2013 a positive or a negative reaction - and both of them fucking suck.\n\nFirst, let's say you tell someone and they get super excited about it. Sounds great, right? Well, not really. You kinda fucked yourself energetically. Now you're on the hook. They become your unofficial boss. Every time you see them, they'll ask about the progress, and trust me, every business or project has its ups and downs. It\u2019s not gonna be all sunshine and rainbows the whole time. You don't need the added pressure of reporting to someone. \n\nThere\u2019s also a negative side to the positive reaction from a brain chemistry standpoint\u2013 when you talk about what you're going to do you get a quick hit of serotonin! It feels good in the moment, but it tricks you into thinking you've already accomplished something. You\u2019ve literally done nothing so far it\u2019s just an idea. Ideas are abundant. So when it's time to actually get to work, it feels like you're trudging through tasks instead of embarking on an exciting new journey.\n\nHere\u2019s what I like to do: I keep things under wraps and let people find out once it's up and running with some momentum! Let them find out on their own. If you succeed they'll figure it out eventually. It\u2019s simply hits 1000 times harder if they\u2019re the ones asking you about it vs you telling them about the project before it\u2019s even a thing.\n\nI don\u2019t know why or how it works exactly but I truly believe in the evil eye \ud83e\uddff..that mysterious force (ego) that sometimes gets triggered when people see you doing something great. Just weird energy simply put. It's not personal; it's all about them projecting their own issues. But hey, you\u2019re not their therapist and you\u2019re not responsible for anyone else\u2019s emotional state and if you happen to be an empathetic person, you\u2019re going to be seriously thrown off by the energies around you when talking about a new project. (Speaking from experience here.)\n\nThe other scenario you may find yourself in when telling someone about your new project, is encountering strong negativity or complete disinterest. (or any other type of \u2018negative\u2019 reactions) That\u2019s just never a good time. Sure, some argue the negative reaction can be used as fuel - \u2018I\u2019m gunna prove them wrong!\u2019.. but if it's someone you care about, it just feels shitty.. like \u2018if that\u2019s how they\u2019re reacting to the initial time I told them about the project, how are they going to act when it\u2019s a massive success? Do they just not care at all?\u2019 (&lt;\u2014 your mind, probably) \n\nNow, I'll admit, there are a few exceptions. There are some individuals you can trust with your plans, but you need to be extremely careful. These are the people who won't get triggered by positive news or secretly relish in your failures. In general, though, it's best to keep your plans to yourself. I'm fortunate enough to have a handful of \u2018real ones\u2019 I can keep it 100 with. But God dammit they\u2019re rare. Even with them, I often wait until things are more solid before I show them what I\u2019m doing. The energy is just so light and pure before any external influence is put on it.\n\nSo, to sum it up, \u2018the secret to manifesting\u2019 is to shut the fuck up. Stop blabbering to everyone about your plans. It's not doing you any good. On top of that, it's way more badass to surprise people with your accomplishments instead of hyping it up all along, desperately seeking validation. \n\nYour energy should be focused on bringing things to life and making them happen, not looking for validation from anything or anyone outside of yourself. I know it sounds cheesy, but you\u2019ve got to care about how you feel more than anything because everything you do is based off your emotional state.",

Skills that can be learned and mastered.\n\nWorking with a psychologist (everyone would benefit from having one for anything that comes up in life) is a great starting point for all the above. I know a psychologist is often hard to come by for most people (especially in a country like the USA). Reach out to the many non-profits for assistance. Don't be scared or feel ashamed.  It is like a trainer at a gym but for your mental health.\n\nUnderstanding yourself, who you are trying to connect with, and why is the starting point. Then, you can start to identify strategically aligned persons that may be great matches. Once you have done that, start reaching out to those people. Be chill. Be gracious. Be respectful. Be grateful. Be passionate. Be patient. Be the best version of yourself. Don't ask for a lot to start. A simple 15 minute call or 30 minutes to grab coffee/tea together. Be intentional and clear about why you are reaching out to them. If you connect and set something up, that's when you can start to vet each other and the possible relationship you are building. As things progress you continue to vet them, establish and manage boundaries, and be aware of red flags to indicate they may not be \"a real one.\"\n\nYou can find people on an endless number of socials, at in-person events and meetups, in trade magazines, or wherever. Be open and receptive to discovering and possibly meeting new people. Be focused but not rigid. A professional relationship is very different from an intimate romantic relationship. You're not living together. You're simply supporting each other where you can.\n\nAnyone can do this starting with ZERO connections or friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;but most people don't have that network in their life (even close friends and family will react in funky ways that can throw off the energy of an idea\n\nThis is usually due to the person sharing their idea in a manner that is hard to understand, overly ambitious if not delusional, or obsessive--they are giving off weird energy that may even be toxic. That often leads to the recipient reacting or responding in a less than favorable manner than what was expected or desired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;remember im talking about the infant stages, the absolute starting point - the idea, not anything real yet. its energetically fragile)\n\nThis is a self-report about your own mentality being weak, easily influenced, and hinging on validation from others without any data to lean on.\n\nIt is only fragile because you are fragile.\n\nInstead of avoiding other people, it is a lot more beneficial to address your weakness and overcome it.\n\nInstead of advising others to give in to weakness, it is a lot more beneficial to help them recognize that weakness and overcome it.\n\nIt is not easy for everyone. I struggled with it. I still do. But, it is exponentially more beneficial to even try pushing through it than hiding.\n\nThis is a weakness that will ultimately doom most. Adversity and outside influences only grow as your company grows. It gets much harder as you go.\n\nAgain, a psychologist is the best starting point for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;this advice is extreme but it works. maybe not for everyone, but for myself in countless examples over the last few decades.\n\nYou think it works. But, you have no idea how many missed opportunities you have had because of shunning away from others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I'm basically saying, in another way, 'just fucking do it' and 'one step forward is worth 1000 years talking about it'\n\nYou are creating a false choice. You can do both. You can be getting shit done while openly sharing with others what you are doing.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;At this point in my life, when someone brings up an idea that they want to start, I try to be positive but it's hard to be when I know they're just looking for short term validation and respect. (unless they've done shit in the past which is an entirely different story)\n\nYou are making a big assumption about people. Why is that all they are looking for?\n\nEven if they are, why are they seeking that? Is it for their ego? Is it to stave off their fears of failure? Is it a misunderstanding of lean methodology and product validation?\n\nHow does what they have done before relate to their motivation behind sharing what they are working on with another person or looking for short-term validation and respect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I used to get hype about it years ago but i learned how most people are just looking to feed off my energy and they are ALL TALK. 99% of people are all talk and need to stop blabbering and start doing\n\nIt seems like you haven't taken enough time to develop empathy, communication, matchmaking, and vetting skills.  Perhaps some more self-awareness would be beneficial as well to re-evaluate your past and current relationships and why you have experienced those situations and may still be (thus, being so extreme in your actions and views).",

But when it comes to telling people in your personal life, it\u2019s a very different story.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just wrong in this thinking, but personally I\u2019ve never seen an example of someone who has succeeded after telling people (friends and family) about the project before it\u2019s even a thing. Also, from personal experience projects fizzle when I tell people, but if I keep my head down and work on them before telling people, then there\u2019s no pressure and it can happen on its own time. \n\nHowever I do know an unbelievable amount of people who have talked about doing something and then absolutely crumbled under the pressure. (Likely the reader of this comment know exactly what I\u2019m talking about). It\u2019s such a common story it\u2019s painful to see.\n\nI always suggest to people that they keep it to themselves when they\u2019re just getting started, at least let it grow a little bit before telling people because an idea is so fragile in those early stages.",

The real lesson though is you should be confident enough in yourself and your ideas that the opinions of a few people won\u2019t stop you. In fact, if some irreverent opinions of people can influence you to the point of scrapping your entrepreneurship, you really don\u2019t have what it takes because there will always be shitty people with shitty opinions.\n\nThe real advice is to learn to filter signal from noise, believe in yourself, and make sure your footing is solid before taking a step.",

We have a war chest of Capitol built up and we control most of the North American market for our primary niche so we have a customer base that we can upsell to with a new product line. Many of our customers are the reason we chose to pivot and bring out the second niche because of the strong demand.\n\nEven with decades of experience in building business and running businesses and being the head of sales of all the efforts I overestimated the timelines.\n\nManufacturing, research and development, and testing took four or five months longer than we expected. We received the shipment in November when we were supposed to receive it months earlier. That's slammed us into Christmas time and end of year inventory concerns for customers. Nobody wants to pay taxes on stuff sitting on a shelf if they don't have to. The next thing was getting the information out to our established customer base while simultaneously breaking into an entirely new market. With the established customer base we had to fit into the buying timelines because a lot of our customers already had product on shelf when we show up, then you have to keep them aware of you until the next buying cycle so if they pull the trigger with you and not go back to their usual supplier.\n\nAll this leads to us discussing with excitement the new niche with friends and family. Now at least once a month I get calls or questions saying hey did you guys break a million dollars yet??? We have not we are in the five figure range but it's growing steadily. People automatically assume it's going to fail because our other side of the business is doing so well. This leads to lots of unwanted advice and criticism. The good news is I have very tough skin.\n\nNext time I'll keep it to myself until we hit numbers that are undeniable like we did with the first niche.

Because of this it is really valuable to make drafts of business plans, investor pitches, and promotions for potential customers.  This might all end up being completely unused, but going through the motions can help to sort things out and draw lines to guide development.  \n\nSecond, it is almost impossible to judge how people will react and there are almost alternative terms, metrics, and framing that may be valuable to incorporate into development.  What sometimes works is to occasionally tell some people you don't know well about some element of the whole plan.  Don't try to get the whole thing across, and don't go far to recruiting.  Ideally this should be someone who will not be interested in following up and will not relate to what you are doing in the same way you and people close to you do.  This can really help to judge if there is value in what is being developed and where that value is and what gives it traction.",

Keeping your ideas to yourself might just keep them from reaching their full potential. Yeah, criticism can sting, but it also sharpens.\n\nAnd let's be real - telling people about your project isn't just about validation. It's about getting pumped, staying committed, and maybe, just maybe, getting some like-minded folks on board. \n\nHeard about the thrill of telling your plans tricking your brain into feeling you've achieved something? Fair point. But we're smarter than that, right? It's about striking that balance - talking the talk AND walking the walk.\n\nNegative reactions? Bring it on! They're your reality check, and sometimes, your best motivator. As for the 'evil eye' - can't stop people from feeling certain ways, but you sure can choose how you react.\n\nSo here's my two cents - don\u2019t just shut up and grind. Your ideas are worth sharing, worth shaping. You might even strike gold in the most unexpected conversations. So take the plunge, and who knows, you might not just make a ripple but a wave.",

Most people do not succeed or work jobs.

It is only wasted money if you burn easily through cash. Hobbies, useless products, you don't need, courses that do nothing all cost money. You don't need justification to spend reasonable money on your business idea.\n\nI also learned two things. Competitors can be defeated by their minds. Dumb people can have an advantage, because they just jump and do.  Tell people and don't care about what others say. We can learn from all kinds of people.\n\nIf you tell people you have to manage expectations, unless you found Investors, hired people, and with great debt imitate Silicon Valley. Those are the most visible and narrated stories.\n\nWe are so accustomed to the fact that entrepreneurs should ask others, make others enthusiastic about their products. Why should that be the case?

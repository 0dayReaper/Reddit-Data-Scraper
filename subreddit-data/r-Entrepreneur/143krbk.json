She wanted a professional pet sitter to stay in her home for 8 days, and provide care for her dog and cat.  Ok, I have the experience.  She found me on Rover which means I had my ratings and reviews, you could see my experience outlined, everything necessary BEFORE contacting me.\n\nI go to her home, and she spends 3 hours yammering on about her whole life story, very little about the animals, and harping on extra references because the other lady who was her friend, didn't have references.  She kept speaking ill of the lady, and comparing the two of us.   \n I told her I could get references together soon, and she said that's not necessary because she &amp; her dog liked me.  Ok, fast forward to the next day when I'm at a client's house sitting.  The pups were outside doing their business, I'm still asking for references because I thought I was going to do the right things and send them anyway;  and this lady calls me to tell me she called Rover corporate, confirmed I didn't have many reviews and references (after I told her multiple times I don't only book through Rover so yeah, I won't have that many).  Keeps comparing me to the other lady and running her mouth about crazy stuff.\n\nI hung up, told her this is not going to work, and wished her good luck before blocking her on everything and reporting her for harassment.  I don't deal with nutbags who can't listen.",

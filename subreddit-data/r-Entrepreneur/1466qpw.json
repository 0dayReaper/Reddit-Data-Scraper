    "postText": "Seems like a basic enough question. An MVP is just the basic functionality of what your product so that you can provide it to your audience for feedback. I still seems to struggle where to draw the line, though. If I am building an app that uses sign up and log in functionality, should an MVP include an option to sign in with google, facebook, etc., or maybe even an \"I forgot my password\" option? Or should it just be a barebones \"enter your username and password\" setup simply to get the user through? Additionally, what about the styling of the product? I understand that this is one of the least important factors of building an MVP, but I would imagine it would have to look at least somewhat pleasant to those providing feedback.\n\nSimply put, is there a more concrete definition of what should be included in an MVP?",

            "comment": "An MVP is only about market learning. And the functionality to learn if enough people will pay enough money is far more minimal than Build It And They Will Come.\n\nYou can put up a landing page and a Buy Now button. But basically an MVP tests your ingenuity to get the vital market learning. You don't actually even need an MVP for that.\n\n&gt;So far smoke testing seems the same with MVP. However, the difference between them is at the stage of MVP you got a product with the most basic features. But with smoke testing, you only have a landing page with a few example images or a video of what your product will look like and a CTA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The webpage can then be used to easily track and quantify early demand for your product in actual dollar-terms, which in turn can validate your hypothesis and determine whether you have a feasible business case. Since the users click on the CTA already pre-bought your product you can contact them after you developed your product and they will be most likely your first paid customers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Smoke Test Before MVP\n\nThere is a terrible steak of inventor's syndrome with launch first, ask question later MVPs. Because most products fail to get traction and the vast majority of businesses fail, the new idea with lean was *obsess about getting clear market signal*. Too many MVP efforts try to get opinions, bug reports, just about anything else but a transaction.\n\n[How To Crash Your Startup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mupm4w/comment/gv8mh4q/?context=3) explains the trap but not the motivation for ignoring what are fairly simple instructions. I go into this with [Getting The First 100 And 1000 Paying Customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/kc5eee/getting_the_first_10_and_1000_paying_customers/gfod409/?context=3) which is always the wrong question to ask.\n\nSimply put, the misunderstanding is trying to find the flimsiest evidence to go ahead -- market be damned. That's not MVP, it never was. The genius of the MVP is invalidation, not confirmation bias. Proving the project will not succeed so you immediately free up your time to get to the next idea, then the one after, and so on. Because most of the ideas are going to fail, you try to minimize the painful end, rip off the bandage and expose the idea to reality so to speak.\n\nTake some other business, like an offline restaurant. Everybody who ever put a pot on a stove right-side-up is sure they can launch a successful restaurant. We all know the statistics do not support this, the restaurant (any restaurant) is extremely likely to fail.\n\nWhat you do instead is a market experiment called a pop-up, far cheaper and quicker than even a food truck. If you succeed and get that market learning, only then would you move to a food truck, scouting locations. With the market learning in place and successful, then you can consider the sit-down everybody wants to start with.\n\nIf we charge nothing and declare restaurant patrons 'customers' and the idea fully validated and the venture *viable*, that batshit craziness is exactly what people are doing with MVP. You can't launch an MVP without the \"V\" by zeroing out price.\n\nI mean clearly you can -- zero is the most popular price these days -- it's just completely wrongheaded and bizarro world opposite of market learning. It's market evasion.\n\nThat is minimal. Build It And They Will Come is *maximal*. I don't care what you strip out of it, you can't know if what you just threw out was the most important thing your market wanted.\n\n[Our Dangerous Obsession With The MVP](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/01/our-dangerous-obsession-with-the-mvp/) explains [The Perils of Prototyping](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~aalbu/SENG%20310%202007/perils.pdf).\n\n[Building A Minimum Viable Product Is Like Serving Burnt Pizza -- don't serve burnt pizza](https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/)\n\n[An MVP Is Not the Smallest Collection of Features](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/articles/product/an-mvp-is-not-the-smallest-collection-of-features/)",

However, the worse your product is, the greater the chance people won't want to buy it. You need to find the crossover of these two curves in the context of your product and market. There are different points for B2B and B2C products, and different points if you know the market exists for your product.",

            "comment": "Don't concentrate on the MINIMUM, concentrate on the VIABLE. \n\nIf your app relies on the Google ecosystem then yeah, having a Google SSO option would be useful. But no need to implement that if you're just market testing. However if you want rapid user acquisition then yeah, add Google, FaceBook, Apple. These all add credibility too. That said, if it's a mobile app, does it NEED login etc. If it's a web app, then sure.\n\nI've worked with dozens of startups on what is minimally Viable. It absolutely has to be viable. But you'd be an idiot if you missed out design, if you didn't employ someone to copyEdit or write some documentation/tooltips. If you didn't have an onboarding video. If you don't have someone sitting waiting for user problems (support). \n\nYour MVP is your first impression. So do what is minimally viable and do it well. Have a plan for rolling out extra related features. (I can give an illustration for an Ed Tech company I worked with if people give a damn)",

Secondly, it's rarely a one-shot success, so when the first shot failed, it tends to be heartbreaking - keeping it means keeping further loss, while not keeping it means losing all the efforts. It needs a lot of mental strength.",

I was making really good money, and didn't really have a lot of stress in my life (apart from the fact I hated my job and had a longing to pursue passions).\n\nI saved enough for me to \"get-by\" for 10 months, and quit. This was christmas last year. I launched into starting my start-up - and we are now 1 month away from launch, raised 6 figures of angel capital, have a 600+ user waitlist, and have a team of 6 working on it. I know for sure this would not have happened had I not taken the plunge.  \n\n\nI do not draw an income, so financial security isn't good at the moment, but I get up every morning inspired and ready to go.\n\nI come across challenges every day - as this world is completely new to me, and the angel investors (who are also co-founders) have 10+ years experience. SO I am always learning and iterating on the fly. I think that's what makes it so exciting.   \n\n\nI have also seen the need for an outlet, so have started writing about another passion of mine - business, sports, individuals and their resilience and challenges to success - [The Champions Journal](https://app.beehiiv.com/) \\- this has allowed me to take inspiration from others, learn new ideas and skills, and take my mind off the start up for some time each day.  \n\n\nIn essence - you need to just take the plunge and start. It's like climbing a ladder, but you are building the ladder as you climb. It looks like it won't get you up, but as you build, the higher you get.",

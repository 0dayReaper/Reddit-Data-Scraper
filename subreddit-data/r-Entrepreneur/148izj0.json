I've worked with some influencers and I've asked them whether their posts actually increase sales for the brands they work for, and to my surprise, it's not the case. At the very least, not as much as you'd think. \n\nAn influencer in the beauty niche with 150K followers might generated 3-5 sales per post. YMMV",

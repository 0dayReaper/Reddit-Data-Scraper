Don't wait for issues to happen to look for a CC processor.\n2. Don't link your Paypal account to a CC or bank account where you keep your funds.  When linking to a bank account, make sure it's kept at $0 so PP can't withdraw money.\n3. Transfer money from PP to your bank account and then away from that bank account to your real one atleast weekly.",

If this is any higher-dollar value art I would strongly recommend other methods; paypal is no longer the default \"feel good\" payment option it once was at the height of eBay",

Speaking from personal experience, as well as countless stories I've heard from individuals and businesses. If you must use them, withdraw money to a safe place regularly, and ideally have a second and even third alternative payment processor ready. PayPal cannot be trusted, and is not suitable for business, at all.",

I made some purchases.\n\nThen I try to send the first invoice and before I sent it to my customer I decided to try and see what the customer sees.\n\nHorrible.  Turns out they did not want to let me take credit card payments at first, but I could have them pay by bank transfer?\n\nThat sounds like a foreign scam.\n\nI went with a company called stripe.\n\nStripped down version of payment interface that allows you to make coupons, sales, and keep track of quantities as they tick off the website sales. \n\nAnyway not an ad for them my thing is it took 5 minutes to set up and PayPal could never provide me with such seem less service so quickly.  The payment interface is awesome for the customer too. Looks real legit.  I didn\u2019t cancel the PP because eBay.

I do not house money there for long because they are not covered by the FDIC. \n\nI did have them freeze my account 1 time in 2014ish when it was linked to a fradulent account in error.

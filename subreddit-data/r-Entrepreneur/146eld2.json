    "postText": "I\u2019ve made some adjustments. One thing I noticed is that.. You don\u2019t make drafts in reddit because if you switch the draft to another tab, it erases. Hence, the late update. \r  \n\r\r  \nI\u2019m not too versed in the reddit format, so I just created a new subreddit so you can view previous posts, FAQ, Theories, etc. r/jojoboba\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m still figuring out what style I want to approach to help out this community. Still at the meta stage, so please be patient. Anyways\u2026 I\u2019ll answer the most asked question this month. \r  \n\r  \n***How does one start a cafe?***\r  \n\r  \nThere are 2 ways to start a cafe.\n\n* Empty box - You lease/buy a space and buy everything from ground up. \n* Turn Key - you buy an existing space and all you have to do it \u201cturn the key\u201d\r  \n\r\n\nThis will depend on your character. But to me, the most important thing to consider in starting a business is your risk/reward ratio. I knew a couple things about myself.\r  \n\r  \n1. I have no knowledge of cafe business\r  \n2. I do not anything in regards to franchise business\r  \n3. I have no on coffee/boba IQ  \n4. Coffeeshop Margins are miniscule. \r  \n\r  \nWhen you don\u2019t have actual experience besides reading books, your business IQ is 0. I can say this now for sure because\u2026. despite my love for books, I was wildly shocked how much I didn\u2019t know. The gap between theoretical knowledge (although important) and practical application are so distant it was quite eye opening. Even more so in true knowledge. \r  \n\r  \nI told the broker that I will not do this unless the cafe is turnkey and it was the right move. In a turn-key, you tend to lose control of how you want to build but you save at least 2x the amount of $. You gain knowledge, you see what's actually possible, what is needed, what is unnecessary and here is why. \r  \n\r  \n**Blender Theory**\r  \n\r  \nAs an example...I have what I call \"blender theory\". The previous owner bought a open blender (vitamix, which I recommend as well) because we use the blender often for frappe, smoothies, and slushes. But there is an issue with the blender. \r  \n\r  \nThe blender is loud. In a small cafe (open style), it echoes quite loudly and disrupts the vibe of the shop. Oftentimes, I can\u2019t hear customer orders, customers can\u2019t hear their order, complain they can\u2019t hear them talk, etc. The difference between an open blender and caged blender is $300 vs $1000. \r  \n\r  \nWhat if we had a cafe that makes our drinks on the back (back style)? Then we don\u2019t need a caged blender.  There are these little things that add up. The refrigerator that opens from left instead of right, the ice machine that's bottom scoop vs height scoop, mixing spoons that's too small vs too wide, size of the equipment, etc. All these little minor details seem irrelevant, but $1 x 10,000 problem is the same as $10,000 x 1 problem. You should do your best to make your mistake thats \"time\" rather than \"money.\" Because you can always find ways to work more, but there isn't always time to get more money. That's why its important to work in the industry first.\r  \n\r  \n**Why your 1st shop should be turn key**\r  \n\r  \nThe dangerous thing about not having any actual experience is that you have no base to know what is right for you. If you built a coffee shop from the ground up and designed an open style cafe, you needed a caged blender, but because it was too expensive you bought an open blender. Then you wasted extra $300 that you didn\u2019t need to waste if you had the previous experience. Because well...you\u2019ll need to get a caged blender later on. \r  \n\r  \n**What is \u201ccorrect\u201d and what is \u201cright\u201d?**\r  \n\r  \nLet's say you want to start a cafe from scratch that is an open style cafe and hire a consultant and you ask them \u201cfind me a blender that's budget friendly under $500\u201d Then they\u2019ll offer you the $300 blender even if you needed the $1000. \r  \n\r  \nIf you are at the Starbucks level, they\u2019ll tell you every variation of every blender and every scenario but\u2026.those company won\u2019t even look at your request. Their consultation fee alone is $10,000. They are not going to bother with small cafe. And the ones who will take your request will do just enough to get you to buy their services. After all, they fulfilled your conditions. \r  \n\r  \nAs a devil's advocate, If they happen to offer the two choices, what do you suppose someone with no experience would say?\r  \n\r  \n\u201c$1000? That's 2x the budget I asked for. I can see how it could be \u2018loud\u2019 but how loud could it be?  Can it justify paying that much more? I saw one online for $300. I shouldn\u2019t get fancy in the beginning i should try to reserve fund as much as possible for emergency. This is the right move\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWell...this was my line of thought, as well as the previous owners thought, and pretty much all the owners I talked who didn't have cafe experience. And guess what\u2026I\u2019m buying the $1000 blender this week. \r  \n\r  \nI can\u2019t say if this is naivete or arrogance but\u2026it  stems from not having experience. Because if you have no experience, you become one of the three; everything makes sense, you think you know everything, or everyone is out to get you. I have been all three.\r  \n\r  \nThat's why these management companies, food consultants, efficiency experts whose job is to save you money aren't necessarily the best thing... And scarily enough\u2026 *even if the number looks right.* \n\nImagine if you open 10 open style caf\u00e9 and buy the open blender, only to have all the customers complain and you buy the new caged blender later. Or worse, you don't know why your business is not thriving. That alone is enough to break the cafe\u2019s profit. Everything looked right on paper but it didn\u2019t translate well later on. These small things snowball into huge success or failure. \r  \n\r  \nThis lesson is hard to explain but if I can try its... what is \u201cright\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily \u201ccorrect.\u201d and what is \u201ccorrect\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cright.\u201d That's why its hard to replicate success based on what someone else have done.  And I\u2019m only talking about blenders. Do you know how much an espresso machine, refrigerator, layout, chairs/table cost? I'll give you a hints, its more expensive than blenders. \r  \n\r  \n**Why vague advices exist**\r  \n\r  \nTo gain\u2026. \"TRUE\" understanding...you have to experience it yourself. \r  \n\r  \nThat's why there is so much truth in the advice \u201cjust try it.\u201d because it's simply impossible to encompass experience into words. No amount of book learning can help you appreciate what it's like to be inside the storm and how to weather it. \r  \n\r  \n**How to connect the dots.** \r  \n\r  \nAnd from my humble experience, it's almost impossible to connect the dots unless you experienced them yourself. \r  \n\r  \nIf I had a blender at home, I would think, \u201cman this thing is loud.\u201d You have that experience in your pocket and maybe you visit a coffee shop and notice \u201cman they make so many frappes, but its not loud, I wonder why?\u201d and you notice that all the blenders are caged blenders. The dot connects. You level up. \r  \n\r  \nSo whatever you want to pursue, experience it in any form possible. Try that new coffeeshop, taste something you haven't before, buy that home espresso machine, look at that new layout, fuck that blender, and etc\u2026\r  \n\r  \nKnowledge in incremental and experience is exponential, so experience what's out there for you in the field you want to pursue. Its the best way to learn.\n\nThat's enough for this month. = P\n\nGotta go blender shopping.\n\nFor next month, I'll tell you how I evaluated the shop and bought the cafe. \n\nJojo.",

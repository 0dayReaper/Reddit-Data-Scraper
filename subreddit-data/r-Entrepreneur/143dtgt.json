    "postText": "Advice wanted.\n\nIm a freelancer that provides services (so like no physical goods). \n\nI have the usual problems I.e some months are busier than others, some clients more difficult than others. But on the whole, I'm doing as I thought I would when I first set out to freelance.\n\nI want to grow. I have some trusted freelancers I send my excess work to. But I want to keep growing and set up as a studio. To achieve this I need more work, more regularly.\n\nOne area I want to promote is my website. I rely on freelance marketplaces a lot at the moment and I'd like to funnel people to the website. \n\nI guess the answer is ads. But I have no clue where to start and my industry isn't big bucks.\n\nSo does anyone have advice? Where should I start? What costs should I expect? Is there some recommended tutorial/trainings?\n\nCheers,",

Issue is that I have like no social media experience and feel so out of my depth even with researching competitors. Imposter syndrome is real when it comes to social media! \n\nIs there a training you could recommend? I've done seo in the past but I'd like to upskill for myself in this if I can",

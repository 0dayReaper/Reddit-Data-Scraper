    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to have a conversation about what we do to create 5 star customer experiences. By that I mean making sure every customer walks away wanting to come back, telling their friends about you, and only calling you because they trust your service/product. \n\nFor me, I\u2019m not live on my new business yet, but I\u2019ve already been thinking about this a lot. I think the first step is making everything completely hands off and easy for them. They sit down with us once (of course more if needed, but generally we know we\u2019re not the most important part of their day so we don\u2019t bother them too much except to give good customer service) and we do all the work, they just get to throw money at their problems essentially. And if there\u2019s anything they have to do, we try to do it for them or hold their hands as much as possible. If they ask us to add a service or product related to our business we will add it. \n\nI think some good things I\u2019ve seen is contractors who always show up, and if they don\u2019t they call ahead and do everything possible to make things right. Another thing I love (as a customer) is when there\u2019s someone who is always accessible that I can reach out to via email/text and their working hours are always clearly labeled somewhere you go to a lot so you always see them. \n\n\nWhat big or little things do you do or like to see others do that you think creates a 5 star customer experience?",

If your business is a construction contractor, you are contradicting yourself  as you said you only want to speak with them once, but want to have access to someone  via e-mail and text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur business tries to take care of everything for our customers.  Our customers don't believe us that we literally do everything because the competing companies are simply that bad, but we have found communication is the key.  Tell customers what to expect during every stage of the process.  In our case, we deliver the product right to our customers and our customers have a hard time visualizing how we accomplish that.  We are working to create a short explainer video so our customers know exactly what we need from them and what to expect.",

            "comment": "&gt;I wanted to have a conversation about what we do to create 5 star customer experiences.\n\nThat's new, most just bitch about one-star reviews here. And it is never a customer giving them negative feedback ... it's a disgrunted ex-employee ... the jealously and devious competitor ... A Vast YELP CONSPIRACY!\n\nTherefore, maybe the very first preliminary is purchase a clue, get a ticket for the first flight out of that state of denial. Perhaps we could include turning comments for your blog back on and actively soliciting feedback through your own site. We could ... but who would be kidding who. Business owners built Yelp's iron foundation work shunning anything that isn't gushing praise and confirmation bias. \n\nNext bitter pill: You Do Not Build a 5-Star Customer Experience for total strangers ... who aren't actually customers. Customers -- that means people who actually pay you money -- are the judge, jury and executioner. They frame the discussion of customer experience. And your can't have the discussion when customers are not given a seat at the table. \n\nSuperficial flourishes and vapid aesthetics are not the alpha and omega of customer experience. People love picking out the new colors for painting the deck chairs on the Titanic. I call the sites that 'look pretty' as dumb blonds. Their numbers are legion.\n\nCustomers will have some kind of experience no matter what. Too many people lean on that factoid like a crutch. If you don't know your customers ... indifference is your customer experience. If you can't understand customers ... cluelessness is the customer experience you put out there. If you are whipping out your bliss and playing with it in public, well then ...customers get the message you are self-involved and not to disturb you. \n\nWant to start off a discussion on 5 Star customer service? Then knock off the self-gratifying self-obsessed bullshit. Look outward. \n\nMetrics are important. Vanity metrics only tell you about your ego. Customer experience is driven by, you guessed it, customer metrics. Get rid of vanity metrics. \n\nFrankly, there can't be meaningful discussion of customer experience until the business owner makes the decision to stop sucking. Stop looking for the least you can possibly do, plus whatever less you can get away with, and do cease calling that 'em-vee-pee.'\n\nFive-star customer experience is a fine and proper discussion to have here ...finally. But so too is asteroid mining as a business, and for neither is the level of discussion there yet. Customers are more than ready for that discussion ...business owners, not so much. \n\n[Customer Satisfaction\u2014the Ultimate Vanity Metric?](https://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/customer-satisfaction-the-ultimate-vanity-metric-0519257) Satisfaction is just bare minimum competence. \n\n[Creativity and Aesthetics and Pretty ... pretty pointless, oh my!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyIdea/comments/8kup76/creativity_and_aesthetics_and_pretty_pretty/) A discussion of customer experience can really advance once we get rid of designers. \n\n[Hey Gang, Let's Have a Brand!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyIdea/comments/7h20m5/hey_gang_lets_have_a_brand/) You can't just sound out the important words, you must comprehend what the pretty words mean.",

I agree with it and think the only real way to get honest feedback is by sitting down and talking to your customers (face to face, zoom, whatever you like).

People will sit down with customers, throw their voice to make it seem to come from the market. People just have a real talent for screwing themselves over.\n\n[My product validation is completely different then real results. Advice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/86pcc1/my_product_validation_is_completely_different/) People won't take in feedback properly, and that is a big problem. They ask skewed questions and warp techniques, which is exactly what happened with the choice and gaming of customer satisfaction scores.\n\nScrewing yourself is a use of feedback. Customers remain unhappy. Playing 'buzzword bingo' with terms like customer experience and user experience is doing something about the issue. Customers remain unhappy.\n\nThe solution I propose is a simple one. And it will work, one way or another. The concept is called \"catalytic mechanisms.\"\n\n&gt;The bottom of every Granite Rock invoice reads, \u201cIf you are not satisfied for any reason, don\u2019t pay us for it. Simply scratch out the line item, write a brief note about the problem, and return a copy of this invoice along with your check for the balance.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me be clear about short pay. It is not a refund policy. Customers do not need to return the product. They do not need to call and complain. They have complete discretionary power to decide whether and how much to pay based on their satisfaction level.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To put the radical nature of short pay in perspective, imagine paying for airline tickets after the flight and having the power to short pay depending on your travel experience\u2014not just in the air, but during ticketing and deplaning as well. Or suppose universities issued tuition invoices at the end of the semester, along with the statement, \u201cIf you are not satisfied with the dedication of the professor in any course, simply scratch out that course and send us a tuition check for the balance.\u201d Or suppose your cell phone bill came with a statement that said, \u201cIf you are not satisfied with the quality of connection of any calls, simply identify and deduct those from the total and send a check for the balance.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Turning Goals into Results: The Power of Catalytic Mechanisms  \n&gt;  \n&gt;by Jim Collins\n\nThere are many forms and wide variety of catalytic mechanism fitting just about any situation. \"Hot fresh pizza delivered to your door within thirty minutes or it's free\" is a kind of catalytic mechanism. And it works ... *or else*.\n\nPeople reject the 'or else' portion of such advice.\n\nSimple, not easy: Improve drastically or cease to exist as a venture. People like the notion of five-star customer experience. They don't have the courage for the kind of ruthless, no-excuses, high achievement culture necessary to achieve it.",

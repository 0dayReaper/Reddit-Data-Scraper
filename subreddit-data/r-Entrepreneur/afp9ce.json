First it was \"my facebook for dogs\" --- then it was Tshirts, or dropshipping --- then it was --- \"how do I make some kind of subscription box thingy --- like BarkBox or Hatch or CrapBox or wahteverBox\". Not an original idea in anyone's head. People love the idea of getting rich - and quick! With zero effort. Never quite works that way, but yeah.\n\nI'd say the biggest value here is how someone started - made the leap into something. That's it. Step 1.

If you don't get any value out of what they post then that's tough luck.\n\nSure you can ban them but you won't stop them as there are other platforms. Its best to just not be a hater and see if you can  get at least 1 golden nugget out of what they post.\n\nBut I get it, if your not making money you may get triggered more easily because it may seem like everyone is lying about making money online. So then you adopt very negative views.\n\nOnce you get to the point where you call everything and everyone a scam your fucked lol. You might as well call Mcdoalds now and tell them you had enough of this \"entrepreneur\" stuff and you want to start work Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you're tired of those type of AMAs just go to marketing events and hang out at the bar. People will tell you their secrets for free. People love to fucking talk lol...If you're not even willing to go to those then there is nothing I could say to help you. ",

Although I can't even remember the last one I read, there's a reason for it.\n\nThese people can't possibly run an AMA for a very simple reason: They don't know what they did with the specificity to explain their success to anyone else.\n\nTake any business, no different from any of a hundred that were not successful, random chance simply intervened. A fluke. Happenstance. You want an AMA? What's the takeaway ... it's better to be lucky than good? I can't say because I don't read them, but have you ever, EVER, read an AMA that answered \"We just got phenomenally lucky. There are no less than sixty instances I can remember where we shouldn't have survived. ....\"\n\nOne guy cited chapter and verse the monumental shortcomings of all the startups he had worked for. You really suggest he not turn that jaundiced eye toward these AMA's? The people he talked about could pass a lie detector test whilst lying through their teeth.\n\nWait one second. I seem to recall the one I read. The dilithium crystal to making their entry into an industry crowded with competition and eating everyone's lunch -- millions of dollars in success? They didn't suck and the rest of the competition in that locale really did.\n\nSo let's get more specific. Because that is going to clear everything up.",

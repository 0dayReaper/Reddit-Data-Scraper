    "postText": "This is my first post here, but I've been a long-time lurker.\n\nLet me set the stage: I'm a 40% co-founder of a tech startup, along with my partner who holds the remaining 60%. We operate in an international ecosystem and our roles are quite delineated - I manage operations, staffing, and conduct some client meetings; I more or less do the roles of a CTO, CIO and COO (not that these matter much at the size we're at).\n\nThis fits well into our business model that relies heavily on working with professionals outside of the US. Being based in Portugal nowadays, I can bridge time zones, cultures, and logistic challenges in a way that would be impossible if I were in the US.\n\nMy partner, on the other hand, is in charge of marketing and financial matters, and has stepped away from doing anything technical in the past few months. In the same comparison I used before, he has the roles of a CEO, CMO and CFO. We used to be very small, just the two of us, and he used to do some tasks, but now that we have made some hires he no longer needs to do anything technical.\n\nRecently, we've identified a new potential direction for our company, which, interestingly enough, would utilize my unique position and the skills I've amassed over the years in a far more impactful way. I see a lot of potential in it and I would like to go that way.\n\nHowever, the equity distribution has been niggling at me. With our new venture leveraging my expertise more, it feels like it's time to reevaluate the equity distribution. I've been considering whether to bring up the subject of starting this new venture as a separate entity or renegotiating our existing equity split to a more balanced 50-50. I feel like there is a cost of opportunity here going with 60-40, rather than starting on my own.\n\nOur company is relatively young and the vesting of our stock only began in December last year, scheduled to occur monthly over a three-year period. I think this might be the ideal time to have this conversation, rather than further down the line when things might get more complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is: has anyone else in this community gone through a similar situation? How did it play out for you? Have you ever seen it happen with other businesses?\n\nIf you have no experience, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nI'm actually set on bringing this up, but I would like to read other points of view.\n\nThanks.",

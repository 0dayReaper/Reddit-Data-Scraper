If you can\u2019t compete with the market due to your expenses you\u2019ll have to reduce costs. \n\nThen come up with a sales pitch for your door sales, make it impressive and include things like \u201cthe other guys won\u2019t but we will\u201d and show that you will do extra work in order to protect the quality of your reputation. Try and come off as ambitious and convey good intentions, make them feel like your more concerned with doing a good job then how long it will take or how hard it will be.",

How much do you guys want to work and how much are you looking to make?  How much money do you want to put up?  IG and door to door stuff is just a part of marketing/advertising/sales, so you'll need to put some more thought and ink into thinking about operating the whole business.  And once again, rethink car washing... completely different animal that wont pair well with driveway work.",

Research and get the right tools, get some practice in with family/friends houses (this is where you time yourself on different sizes and figure out cost/pricing), go door to door with easy to reach phone/sm, you are bound to get customers.  Sell tools at the end of summer, get new ones next summer if you wanna do it again.  Just be sure to have insurance and/or liability waivers AND have plans ready for when you fuck up.  Hey, I just outlined your biz plan, just work out the details and numbers.  Good luck",

Put them on doors in your target area. When you start getting jobs ask if they know of anyone else that might need your services. After you have a few jobs, get som cheap business cards. You will need something like square to take non cash payments, and you will need to charge sales tax. You will need a trusted adult to set some of this up. Best of luck.",

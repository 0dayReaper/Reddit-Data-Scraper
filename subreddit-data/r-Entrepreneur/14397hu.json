Is there a tool wherein I can spy or at least get an estimate how much traffic a search or display ad generates? (without having to access the admin panel as I will be searching competitors)\r  \n\r  \nIs there a tool to spy how much they spent on social media marketing? Facebook, instagram, twitter etc\r  \n\r  \nIf the above is not possible, which platform can I use to get some data to be able to gauge digital marketing, online campaigns, ads etc.?\r  \n\r  \nCan spyfu or semrush tells you the breakdown of the sources of traffic, in the level whether from paid ads or organic social media posting?",

However, you can explore their ad formats and engagement data, such as on LinkedIn Pages where there is an \"Ads\" tab, or using tools like SEMrush that offer similar services. Additionally, if you work with an agency, they may be able to provide some industry or competitor data, although it is usually not exact and should be treated as a reference rather than precise information.",

As for the social media data, unfortunately, it's not possible to determine their exact spending. But you can use tools like Social Blade or HypeAuditor to estimate their followers' growth and engagement rates on social media. Hope that helps!",

They show you the exact ad, when it was started, which platforms it\u2019s being shared on. Sadly it doesn\u2019t show interests or behaviors or how it\u2019s performing but if a company has the same as for a year it\u2019s obviously performing well",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve built a phone call answering bot powered by ChatGPT. It\u2019s intended to be used by businesses - the bot will act as a customer service agent and collect name, contact info, and ask why someone is calling by default. You can also configure it to ask/talk about other stuff. There will be a portal where you can see all these conversations the bot has.  \nHere\u2019s a sample number I setup (for my chatbot company): +1-936-227-4306. You can call that number to talk and see how it works.  \nLet me know if you have any questions/comments/want to use it.  \n\\[Side note\\]: Since I\u2019m using a free phone plan right now, when you call that number the first thing you\u2019ll hear is an automated message about a trial account. Just press any number to get to the actual phone call.",

I quit in December, started a start up with 2 other cofounders, and in that time, has gone from an idea, to 600+ on the waitlist and a month from launch.\n\nI\u2019ve also started writing and interviewing for [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe), about to start a podcast, and have many other things I want to pursue.\n\nLife isn\u2019t about following the trend. It\u2019s about doing what makes you happy, and finding a way to monetise it.\n\nIf you make it fun, it can be fun. Chase what makes you happy. Money can always be made.",

I've been a professional software developer for over a decade and we are only starting to gain traction in my startup after about 2 years. Up until now I've been paying myself minimum wage, it's brutal.\n\nIf you want more software industry feedback feel free to DM, i could help you estimate the scope of what you are trying to build better.

Or work within budgets and build that relationship. \n\nWhereas I didn't build relationships at corporate because I was a behind the scenes guy. Getting tasked with everything butt the kitchen sink. \n\nIf you're looking to start your own business and have a solid skill, do it. You won't regret it and there's a lot of good people out there that can help and mentor you along the way. Myself include. Don't be discouraged by \"do they offer health insurance\" (if in the states) or what do I do to get consistent income.

I put a lot into the agency - even quitting my freelance work at one point so I could put more energy into my day job - but then COVID hit. I was lucky enough to still have a job but they laid off so many people, we pivoted the business to a different focus, and the working conditions started to get unethical. I tried my best to hold on and be patient, hoping things would get better as we adjusted to a new way of working. But it got bad enough that I decided I was going to quit. I put a bunch of stuff out, had a few interviews, and a promising offer. \n\nBut then a former client/friend of mine gave me a reality check. She told me that she saw potential in me and that I should really give the entrepreneurship thing a try. She had a big project for me, plus I had a bit of savings from the stimulus checks, so I decided to turn down the offer and try it out. \n\nNearly 3 years later, I'm really glad I did.

Your story does not convince me this is your turning point to become an entrepreneur. Instead, I think you need to rework your approach to job applications and the interview process.

I started off as a tire and oil change guy which quickly annoyed me because it is grunt work. I asked if they would teach me the more advanced stuff and corporate said no but I needed up \u201cshadowing\u201d a coworker a lot and learned quite a bit. After about a year /year and half I was asking to move up based on what I learned and what I could do now. It was denied. I went out of my way and got ASE certified (national auto repair standard) at my own expense and asked again with proof at passing the tests. Was denied again. I then started to look elsewhere, started hoping around from terrible dealership to shop to shop. Shortest I ever  lasted at a place before just walking out was 5 hours due to many reasons. Ended up re applying to the first job and moved up one ring on the ladder. Next week I registered an LLC online, bought a 2k ford explorer of Facebook marketplace and started offering mobile side work on the weekends. I was also dipping my toes with college at this time but I kept failing classes and hated the whole experience because I just wanted to make money and hustle. Got to a point where I was making significantly more on the weekends than all week at work while only working like 3-4 hours a day. Ended up quitting and haven\u2019t looked back over 2 years later. \n\nBad management, deceptive job posting and the best way for me to describe it is an industry stuck in the past.",

When I talked to companies I found myself suggesting contract to hire because what if the job was terrible? With Contract to hire I could exit cleanly. Then one day I was on the phone with the unemployment agency, maybe 3 weeks after layoff - you had to dial every day and press one for still unemployment and one for still looking for work - and the question was like \"if you want to find a job and you are looking for work and seriously you want to be a salaried person with a J.O.B. press one.\" I hung up the phone and started working my side hustle more.\n\nI had a big contract within 2 months, it required travel, and I have a laptoppy job, so I could work all day and do more side stuff at night.\n\nThat was twelve years ago.\n\nStill here.",

My boss (owner of the company) who always praised me as a great asset to the company, who always said that with me the company would fail, sold the company for some $80million. And the new company decided to lay off all the staff without notice. And the boss who always use to take my calls, blocked me.\n\nThat day I decided and promised my wife we'll never be in that position again. after 3 months of unemployment, started working as a consultant in my field as self employed. Then after few more months, learned how to swing trade from Udemy/Coursera, practiced with paper accounts. We never got to save enough money to buy house. So used that money as our \"rainy day\" fund and what ever was remaining, I used it as a capital and started a trading business.\n\nAs of today, I am able to generate 50% of my bare minimum essentials worth of money from my trading. Goal is to get to to 100% of my life style from it. \n\nHope you find this helpful. Good Luck!",

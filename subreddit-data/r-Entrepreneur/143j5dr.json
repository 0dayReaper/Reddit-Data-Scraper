    "postText": "I want to borrow \u00a320k to start a business but every company I go to rejects me due to previous debt and my credit score. I don't know where to turn, I want to.open a pizza shop on a very busy road, found a great location and have a chef ready and business plan yet these loan companies are horrible, I applied to at least 10 all rejected. Any advice please.\n\nIs there a company that will lend me the money for the business?\nIs there a government scheme for a start up?\nIs there alternative ways to raise the money?\n\nI hate my job, I have the skills to start a business, I didn't back in Tunisia, but here it seems impossible. \nI work and work and can't save because the tax, council tax, food, rent and everything is more expensive.",

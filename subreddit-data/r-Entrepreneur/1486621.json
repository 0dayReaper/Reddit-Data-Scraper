    "postText": "I've started a website that lists business/commercial spaces that allow brands to have product sampling, product launch, product demo type of events - the idea being to connect with the existing guests/people in the space.\r  \n\r  \nSo think of it like storefront but instead of renting a space for the purpose of having a retail presence, we're also offering the option to connect with the consumers that actually visit the space and who already have clearly mapped out interests. For example, in a gym space, fitness and wellness brands can connect with consumers who clearly have an interest in a healthy lifestyle.\r  \n\r  \nThe only issue is I've been having a hard time having traction in getting spaces on board with the idea. I've managed to get about 20 spaces in one city, but that's not enough variety - the target was at least 100 spaces.\r  \n\r  \nShould I continue with the measly 20 spaces or pivot to something similar to this industry?\r  \n\r  \nAlso, right now my website clearly displays the space name, should I hide that behind a paywall to avoid platform leakage? Right now my model is I earn commission for each product sampling boking in a space.\r  \n\r  \nI've invested so much money and more importantly time into building this and reaching out to multiple spaces, it feels heartsick to just abandon it but I also want to realistic without sinking more money into it.",

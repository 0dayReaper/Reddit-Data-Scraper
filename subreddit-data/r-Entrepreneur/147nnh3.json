    "postText": "Hey everyone.\n\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve been trying to grow an audience to start introducing products/services.\n\nI started two brands in the faith niche.\n\nFirst brand has a following as follows:\n152k on insta\n32k on Fb\n62k on Pinterest\n64k on TikTok\n13.9k visitors to my blog per month\n1k visitors to my store\n\nFor this brand, I introduced faith based products such as apparel. The products truthfully don\u2019t do great, but I don\u2019t do any advertising. I make about $500 per month from sales. \n\nMy second brand has a following as follows:\n\n(Keep in mind this started a 3 months ago)\n185k on tik tok\n15k on Fb\n1k on insta\n\nFor this brand, I am selling a service (an app) with a subscription model and an api fee for faith businesses. We haven\u2019t launched yet, but we make about $300 per month from content monetization.\n\nI work in corporate banking (Treasury Management). I truthfully am getting burned out working 12-15 hours per day with no breaks. Is there any advice or guidance that anyone would be willing to share?",

That's insane!\n\n  \nYou could easily sell social media growth coaching or build a course on how to grow on social media and sell that. \n\n  \nQuit your job, work less and work on your brands for 3-4 hours a day.",

Just baffles me that I can grow an audience quickly, but struggle with selling a product/service. I\u2019ll look more into selling a course, do you have any suggestions on where to sell a course? I\u2019ve honestly never bought one, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a marketplace or anything.",

Pivot into collaborator marketing by supporting other brands. Try some strategies and see what works for you. \n\nI would stay away from the whole course thing as its easy to create one but a lot harder to sell it.",

This is just from personal experience, I had a viral video on TikTok which boosted me from 0 to 2k followers in a short period of time, but that doesn't mean that I will be guaranteed even 1k views on a TikTok, the algorithm doesn't care much about followers or force followers to see info on the app.",

Their feedback might provide insights on how to improve your products, what new products they might be interested in, or what's preventing them from purchasing.\r  \n\r  \nConsider Partnerships or Collaborations: Joining forces with other faith-based influencers or businesses could help broaden your reach and bring in additional revenue.\r  \n\r\r  \n\rSelf-Care: The burnout you're feeling is serious. It's essential to find ways to care for yourself, whether that's setting boundaries around work hours, delegating more tasks, or taking time each day for relaxation and rejuvenation.\r  \n\r  \nBuilding a successful business takes time.

The longer you delay it, the longer this period will last. Rip off the bandaid and take the next step! \ud83d\udcaa \n\nAs for your burnout, make sure you're taking time to yourself. It sounds like you might not be working to a default diary / organised system of deliverables and therefore are working until you drop every day. Break down your tasks and check them off, setting manageable deadlines and be happy with incremental progress rather than big leaps. \n\nThe cliche of \u201cIt's a marathon, not a sprint\u201d is relevant here. \n\nI've also sent you a DM as would like to speak to you about your growth.",

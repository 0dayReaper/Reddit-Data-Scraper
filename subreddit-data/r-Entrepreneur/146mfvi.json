    "postText": "I own a small business where I make smoke stones and leaf trays. It\u2019s tricky to advertise because it falls under the paraphernalia category, so most of my ads get shot down very quickly. The majority of my marketing is done through social media (mostly IG). \n\nI\u2019ve worked with influencers in the cannabis niche, and that did increase sales but only for short periods of time. I need a more direct approach that won\u2019t trip up the community guidelines, or make it look like I\u2019m selling weed. \n\nAny ideas on how to successfully and discreetly promote my products?",

Huge market for accessories there.\nCome up with a wholesale catalog for your products and reach out to distributors/smoke shops.\n\nFocus on building a community. Participate in events where vendors are allowed. Trade shows are cool but usually limited to big companies. However, they are great for meeting people. Set up your own e-commerce.",

I do have a wholesale catalog and that\u2019s where most of my orders come from. I also work events, and actually host them, and sell a lot during the events. I also have my own e-commerce site and I get more traffic there than Etsy. I honestly need more marketing strategies to help work around the community guidelines, or get my product seen by a larger audience.",

That's some high stakes marketing! \ud83d\ude02 Ever thought about making your leaf trays and smoke stones into 'artisan incense holders' or 'aesthetically pleasing coffee table accessories'? You'd be surprised how many 'herb enthusiasts' might catch on to what you're really selling! And hey, ascend viral could also give you a hand in navigating this 420 dilemma. Who's up for some 'incense' burning?",

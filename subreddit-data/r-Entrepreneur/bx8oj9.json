    "postText": "**Never Split the Difference \u2013 Chris Voss**\n\nThe most important book on this list. It outlines and reinforces the fact that business, negotiation and any human interaction is inherently very emotional. It\u2019s centered around negotiation but this book has so many solid management and leadership principles. Mirroring, tactical empathy, starting with no and labeling are all phenomenal.\n\n***The E-Myth Revisited \u2013 Michael Gerber***\n\nThe first stop for any beginner. This is a great book about the importance of creating a business that can thrive without you. Preaches a lot of my favorite business principles like working on the things that are important for the long term but not necessarily urgent or pressing. Can be a little satire / elementary at times (the hotel description and Sarah\u2019s \u201call about pies\u201d are poor examples) for the more accomplished entrepreneurs but the principles are rock solid.\n\n***Entreleadership \u2013 Dave Ramsey***\n\nThis book just has non stop quality advice about how to build a business the right way.\u00a0 Dave doesn\u2019t preach about politics or religion. He just tells it like it is and tells the stories of what worked for him. Phenomenal read.\n\n***Ego is the Enemy \u2013 Ryan Holiday***\n\nRyan studies and preaches Stoicism and how to handle emotions, rejection and stress. Managing that split second between an event and your reaction is what life is all about. The Ego is the Enemy shows the incredible importance of remaining humble and the dangers of overconfidence and an inflated ego. I also recommend The Obstacle is the Way and The Daily Stoic by the same author.\n\n***Principles \u201cLife &amp; Work\u201d \u2013 Ray Dalio***\n\nAn awesome\u00a0book but my main takeaway is the discussion on strategic decision making. \u201cRadical Open-mindedness\u201d. It\u2019s human nature to want to be right and appear right in the eyes of others. People who make the best decisions know they don\u2019t have all the answers so they are open to many other points of view. They change their minds often even at the expense of their own ego.\n\n***Built to Sell \u2013 John Warrillow***\n\nThis book talks about how to get your life back once your business takes over. How to specialize in your niche and do it really well. Make it scalable an take yourself out of the equation so that it is valuable to a potential buyer. Story format. Very good.\n\n***The Goal \u2013 Eliyahu Goldratt***\n\nAlso in story format this is all about removing bottlenecks from your business. Find out what is holding you back and really focus on fixing that issue so you can break through and expand. The owner of the small business is almost always the bottleneck.\n\n***Company of One \u2013 Paul Jarvis***\n\nLarge scalable companies aren\u2019t likely and aren\u2019t the goal of many entrepreneurs. Starting small and specializing is the key to building a great lifestyle business and then an asset that produces money while you live the life you want to be living. This book helps you question if growth is really the goal.\n\n***How to Win Friends and Influence People \u2013 Dale Carnegie***\n\nA bit cliche but this is packed full or resources that are useful when it comes to dealing with other people and selling yourself or your service. Don\u2019t criticize, condemn or complain. Give honest and sincere appreciation. Become genuinely interested in other people. These are just a few. This takes practice and I recommend reading and thinking on a summary at least once a year after.\n\n***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People \u2013 Stephen Covey***\n\nThe original productivity guide. How to set goals and make them happen. 1. Be proactive. 2. Begin with the end in mind. 3. Put first things first. 4. Think win-win. 5. Seek first to understand, and then to be understood. 6. Synergize. 7. Sharpen the saw. This is worth reading and studying your notes at least every year.\n\n***Good Boss Bad Boss \u2013 Robert Sutton***\n\nHow to lead and empower your employees. How to delegate and how to make sure people are living up to their full potential. My dad always told me that Michael Jordan made the players around him better. This book explains how to be the Michael Jordan of your business.\n\n***The Greatest Salesman in the World \u2013 Og Mandino***\n\nLife is all about being comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Everyone is a salesman and sales is uncomfortable. This book is a pump up about determination and perseverance and its importance. Its not always going to be fun. Its not always going to be easy.\n\n***2019 Small Business Taxes \u2013 JK Lasser***\n\nThe best tax resource there is for small businesses. Reads like a text book but for some reason I absorbed it quickly and it was an enjoyable read. Explains all the important concepts around deductions and how to make sure Uncle Sam only gets what is actually his. A good accountant is critical but its even more critical that you understand this yourself.\n\n***High output Management \u2013 Andy Grove (founder of Intel)***\n\nMore on the techy side of things but this book is a great way to think about building a business. A little older (1983 originally) but a look into the mind of one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Everything is a process. Focus on data and other measurable variables. How to run meetings. How to make great decisions. Long term plans and short term objectives. And so much more.\n\n***Good to Great \u2013 Jim Collins***\n\nHow so many companies get complacent and turn over in our economic lifecycle by failing to constantly improve and stay on the cutting edge. Its easy to stop looking at the big picture when you are winning. Then all of the sudden its too late.\n\n***The Lean Startup \u2013 Eric Ries***\n\nThe business plan is just a hypothesis until you get out and prove it. Get out and interact with your customers and be ready to shift gears at a moments notice. As Steve Blank says \u201cthere are no facts in the building so get the heck outside!\u201d Lots of great case studies and proof of each concept.\n\n***Epic Content Marketing \u2013 Joe Pulizzi***\n\nWriting amazing content that stands out from the crowd is the new way to dominate SEO. Create content that is the best on the internet and you\u2019ll succeed at driving traffic and increasing sales. Avoid sales language. Remember that its a process and a long term goal that requires consistency.\n\n***The Dip \u2013 Seth Godin***\n\nThis is a short book (75 pages) and it only took me a few hours to read. Its meant to get you thinking and the real works when you apply the concepts to your life and your business.\n\n**Loopholes of Real Estate \u2013 Garrett Sutton**\n\nThis book explains, in a simplified version the advantages of building long term wealth through real estate. Taxes, appreciation and cashflows are all covered. 1031 exchanges, capital gains, depreciation and more. A great read from the standpoint of housing and apartment rentals but can be applied to any asset class.\n\nI'd love some other recommendations!\n\nIf you are interested in this type of thing hang out with us over in r/sweatystartup!",

It follows along the theme that emotions can really wreck your decision making process if you let them shine through the reason and logic.\n\nHave you read Never Split the Difference? He has a good section on how \"no\" is actually a lot more comfortable for people during a negotiation or sales situation. Stating clearly what you don't want or what you aren't comfortable with allows you to move forward. The salesmen pushing for yes too soon are more likely to create uncomfortable situations and the counterpart really puts up the guard and its a lot harder.",

My best take away was the 'calibrated questions'.  When negotiating basically don't give in to demands or insist on positions, but instead answer questions with calibrated questions.  The simplest form would be \"How am I supposed to do that?\"  I want to meet your price but given my situation please tell me how I can give you what you offer.  You keep it up and essentially wear them out mentally.  People don't give into demands because they have changed their mind or you made a valid point, they do it because they are simply tired of fighting it.  All of this from an FBI hostage negotiator who had to negotiate on a life or death level never giving an inch and demanding all concessions in return.  I have actually used some of the many techniques described and to my surprise they worked.  Worked in situations where my coworkers had given up on.",

They can afford to bring new products to market. They can afford to spend millions a year in R&amp;D. They can take risks funded by the core business operations.\n\nBlue oceans are incredibly expensive to develop. The customers don\u2019t know you exist. You have to educate a market. The marketing spend can be massive. All in the \u201chopes\u201d that there is actually a need.\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough of them to go around.\u00a0**If you spend your time and energy trying to find a blue ocean you\u2019ll likely end up spending years sitting on your hands or failing over and over again**.\n\nBooks like this propagate this \u201cidea fallacy\u201d that is the foundation of modern entrepreneurship culture. What is your business idea? Whats your differentiator? Have you found your blue ocean?\n\nI personally believe this is the wrong way to look at entrepreneurship if you want to have a shot to actually get something going and start the ball rolling.\n\nEntrepreneurship is about momentum. Its about starting really small and getting your feet wet. Something simple. Something local. Something other companies are already doing and customers are already on the market.\n\nThe successful entrepreneurs aren\u2019t great at spotting ideas \u2013\u00a0**they are great at spotting opportunities**\u00a0and they have the decision making skills to figure out which ones to chase.\n\n\\--\n\nThe Millionaire Fastlane - another book that argues for scale and big big big. \"In order to make millions you must reach millions\". This just isn't good advice. You can have a great successful business with 1000 customers a year. If you try to reach millions you'll end up designing a service for nobody in particular and you'll get beat out by the companies that specialize. You'll end up never being able to target your marketing and get in front of your ideal customer. You'll end up competing with massive companies on a global scale. You'll end up failing and working for the man...\n\nThe icing on the cake for me with this book is the plan to make all the money, sell the company and then simply put it in safe bonds yielding 5% return per year. Are you kidding me man? You have big money and likely a lot of knowledge and you're going to invest in an asset class yielding 5%? Real estate should be the end goal every time. Massive tax advantages and the ultimate passive income stream.\n\nInterested to hear some other thoughts on these two...\n\nJust my 2c!",

His point that clipping coupons, skipping Starbucks, and scraping away a few hundred per month so you can hopefully be a millionaire in 30 years is super risky advice.  Compared with entrepreneurship at least.\n\nAlso, one other quibble with your post -  real estate is great, but it is absolutely not the ultimate passive income stream. It takes significant time to find good deals, and even with a manager a rental property or portfolio requires time investment.  Bond income, while lower return, is definitely the safest and most passive investment possible if that's what you're looking for",

The first few chapters alone make this book amazing with a wonderful story.   If you read books on the business you never hear how it didn't go well. This book is all about how the founder and his peers seemed to always be making hard choices and were constantly doomed to fail... But didn't. In contrast to other books, the quote from Mohammed Ali fits most books on business, \"everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\" This book is about taking ever sucker punch a corporation can throw at a CEO and how this one survived.",

At some point I started feeling like I was just regurgitating info. Pushing in content (some of it high quality). But not really utilising or processing that much.\n\n200 books is a mountain... Any post or during the read habits you have for real processing or are you mostly feeling the surface",

A little more than a book and a half a month.\n\nNow I have an app called Blinkist that allows me to listen to the summary of a self help book in about 15 minutes. I usually have to listen a few times and I take some notes on anything that interests me. If I think its worth it I order the book and dive in.\n\nPodcasts are an amazing resource here as well. Tim Ferriss has had on most of these authors. Including Ryan Holiday who has a great episode and I also love Seth Godin on there.",

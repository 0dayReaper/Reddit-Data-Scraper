    "postText": "\n\nI'm thinking of starting a small entrepreneurship with my friend. I've always thought of having my own business and I've proved myself that I have the discipline, hunger and work ethic to hustle. \n\nI live in Tijuana, and I love to get myself a coffee whenever I go on my daily morning walks. There's this place that sells sweet bread and that's the reason I go there even though there are better coffee shop options. Other coffee places only sell cookies and brownies and random things. \n\nMy friend studied gastronomy and makes a traditional Mexican bread called \"concha\" with his own twist to it. Conchas are usually not that moist insids but his had a sort of buttery consistency to it that made it unique (In my opinion).\n\nSurprisingly, he gets many orders by friends of his and an idea popped into my head. There is a guy younger than me that bakes cookies and brownies and distributes them to the majority of the coffee shops in Tj and I thought to myself, \"If he could do it, why couldn't I do it too?\" \n\nLike around 80% of coffee shops don't sell any sort of bread to go alongside my coffee. They only sell cookies and brownies. \n\nMy idea is to come up with a plan to sell his sweet bread in the many coffee shops that exist in Tijuana since I've seen that many actually support small entrepreneurs. \n\n\nThis is my plan:\n\nBake an initial 5 small \"test\" breads to see if anything goes wrong with them after packaging (Things like the bread going bad or dry). I don't want to sell something I don't fully know myself. I want to see how many days it can go in a small plastic wrap before it gets bad, or if it goes bad at a fast or slow rate. \n\nMy friend will be taking care of the whole baking process and I will be taking charge of the whole operation and distribution of the product. \n\nWe will be starting with \"vanilla flavored\" conchas and gradually add different flavors and even make protein-rich and healthier alternatives for those going to the gym\n\nThe name of my small bakery will be called \"Lola &amp; Carmelo\" (That's the name of his dog and mine lol) \n\nAfter the initial baking tests, bake a good amount and place them in a small transparent plastic packaging and go around asking the owners if they could give us a chance. I'm willing to even give out \"test\" pieces so that they see how it sells and convince them that my product is a guarantee.\n\nAs of now, it's just an idea that I'm convinced will work out. I just need to sit down with him and talk business. A few friends of the family are in the 'food distribution' business so I will be consulting things with them also but I would like if any of you guys have any experience with a bakery and  the distribution part. If so, I would love to hear your feedback.\n\nEventually, if things go as planned, I would be buying a bigger and better industrial oven. Not focusing on the profits, but reinvesting the money on the operation so that we could work more efficiently and gain experience and knowledge with business.\n \nLike I said earlier, if any of you guys have experience with a bakery or distributing \"snaks\" to medium businesses, I would love it if you guys could leave your experiences down on the comment section. Best of luck for all of you \ud83d\udc4c \n\n\n\n\"How big would you dream if you knew you couldn't fail\"",

            "comment": "It may be better to start with a small shop (your own) if possible. Distributing the conchas to medium sized business will require you to be a trustworthy supplier. It means you have to register the business and have food safety certificate for your bread. It's generally like that, but it may be different over there.\n\nHaving your own store, even if it's small, will help to gain early customer and monitor the effect of the bread. It's still not easy as you need to frequently post something about it in social media. However, having media presence will also help when you are trying to distribute those to medium business later on.",

I would hire someone who knows (and studied) more about marketing than myself. \n\nI wouldn't like taking the \"cheaper\" alternative. If I'm gonna do something, I'll do it the right way. \ud83d\udc4d I appreciate your feedback!",

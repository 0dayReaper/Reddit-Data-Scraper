    "postText": "Step 1) Sell people the idea of being successful. If you can convince people they are moving in a positive direction by reading your material then you have already won over your audience, even if they never do a thing with it. \n\nStep 2) Give a bunch of general, bullshit advice that can't actually be applied because EVERY business is different but seems practical.\n\nStep 3) Talk about how profitable your venture is while wasting your \"valuable\" time trying to create a book that you will sell for $10.00 because you are actually a sham and make money by selling the idea of success instead of actually creating anything of value.\n\nStep 4) Make sure you have no moral compass and have sociopathic tendencies \n\nStep 5) Being an egocentric douche is an added plus \n\nStep 6) Take a bus to the city and look for nice cars to pose with and buy fake Hublot watches off Aliexpress to post photos of on Instagram to create the illusion that you are extremely rich for your followers\n\nStep 6) Profit\n\n\nIf all else fails you can create a subscription box company. I hear the margins are GREAT.",

Basically saying 'some things are money sucks and some things aren't, choose wisely' is again, something that's common sense, but is generally not applied in real life for most people. I mean I own a lot of investment property now and while he didn't necessarily teach me how to do that, he did teach me that it was probably a bad idea to buy a really nice truck for the same amount as a down payment on a fixer upper that now nets me a lot of money whereas the truck would be worth half as much now. Most people don't grow up with that explained to them thoroughly. Most people buy the car.\n\nSo all in all, his book can probably be 10 pages of basic principals, but I thought his story was engaging about the two different parents. Engaging enough to read at that age anyway. To be honest, I haven't re-read it in a decade, maybe it's shit haha",

If we give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's not talking about actual material information that constitutes insider trading, but rather just leaning on the knowledge of expertise, then yes, I would be completely okay with that. (This is, after all, how any entrepreneur worth their salt would build their network)\n\nAs for the deduction stuff, that part I know is not so much illegal as it is just an ethical grey, which I actually don't have too much problem myself. (startups gotta do what they need to in order to survive, after all)\n\nI still have a lot of problems with a lot of his advice, but that's a whole different conversation.",

I started a failed brain supplement company, then wrote a book on how you can sit on your ass and make money by working a couple hours a week. I didn't literally mean four hours a week though. That was more of a metaphor for working sixty hours a week. I hate when people bring up that point. I am offering most of my content for free though. Just listen to this 10-minute ad first about underwear. I can waste 400 audio hours of your life and you will still be broke.\n\nHey I am just a average new york city guy. I did some trading in the past and I made some money, then invested in the dot-com crash and lost it all. Then I made it all again. I think the future is self-employment. I am going to invite some half-celebrities and ask them how they made it. So you can make it. Most people don't have just one, but 10 sources of income. That's a genius strategy. Have ten sources of income and make ten times the money. And if you buy my book, I will make you believe you can do that.\n\nHey, I have an answer for everything. Got a job interview? Here are the three steps to getting that job. Bada-boom, Bada-bam. Want to re-negotiate your credit card debt? I can help you. By the way, I don't take payments from people with credit card debt and that makes me legit. I don't know how you are reading this because I specifically said I don't take credit card debtors. I give away ninety percent of my content for free and keep the other content to sell to the most successful of my followers for thousands of dollars. Write an e-book. I was fat once and I went to the gym and lost weight. That proves that you can achieve your dreams too. I'll teach you how to be rich, ready? Okay so the first step is mindset. Don't take no for an answer. Got it? The rest of the advice I give to my inner circle of people or in my e-book which you can buy at the bottom of this page. ",

He was living it and making millions before talking about it (with his supplement company) and you have to read his stuff over the years to see how he keeps moving to another level. \n\nThe ONLY thing I will say negatively about Ferriss is he hypes the upcoming books a little too hard. The guy doesn't need cash, just look at his exits and current investments, it's all ego now - and rightly so. ",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve got a plot of land in a developing town. The plot is right in front of a major highway and university campus. There are no businesses in this area because it was previously owned by an industrialist. He\u2019s begun selling plots very recently. \n\nI\u2019ve got three options for what I could do with this plot of around 1000 Square meters assuming that the cost of construction is more or less similar: \n\nA) Build a hotel. Business is seasonal in nature due to local weather. Lower expenditure and involvement. \n\nB) Build a commercial complex to franchise fast food businesses. This is relatively more expensive than A) due to the franchise cost.\n\nC) Build a commercial complex to lease space to different tenants for a fixed and regular income.",

It would be a shame to build a hotel and then a bigger nicer one goes up next door.\n\nIs there something else you could put there that is missing from the area, that could bring more profit?\n\nAll 3 of these businesses need lots of parking and a franchise restaurants may have specific requirements for building design.\n\nWhy have you chosen these 3 options in particular?\n\nSorry for the stupid questions but I'm not from the US and we don't have many of these type of developments and the ones we do have usually fail so I was wondering what is different with the US market.",

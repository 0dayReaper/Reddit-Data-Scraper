    "postText": "Hi, my name is Ivan and I made a free photo editor [www.Photopea.com](https://www.Photopea.com) . It is very advanced and I am confident to say, that it can replace Adobe Photoshop, Pixelmator, Affinity Photo and other tools.\n\nI released it in 2013 and now, 4 million people have used it in the last 30 days. All this time, I wanted it to be totally free to use. It has attracted many people who can not afford to pay. Many of them are children, who use like 1% of features. Some teachers teach Photopea at schools, because a school can not afford expensive software, or they only have Chromebooks (which can not run regular apps).\n\nI still struggle to attract businesses. To be clear, there are some adults, professionals (not necessary designers) using Photopea. They even use it to solve tasks for their employer / company. The company usually doesn't provide any software to do the job, or they don't like the interface of the software they are given, or the software they get can not do what they need.\n\nThese people tend to keep it a secret, that they used Photopea. Often, it sounds like they are afraid, that their boss would be angry at them for not using the tool they were told to use. Or they feel ashamed to admit they use a tool nobody has ever heard of (like wearing watches from a brand nobody knows). In short, it feels like some companies are paying for software X, which nobody uses, and employees end up using software Y, for which nobody pays.\n\nI would like to make Photopea more \"sexy\" to companies. They could start using a free version (with ads), and if they like it, they could order a Premium for their employees. Could you maybe look at Photopea and give me some hints, what could I do to improve it?\n\nP. S. Photopea runs in a web browser and I think 60% of businesses do not trust such tools, as they are used to \"own\" the software and have it in their device (even though Photopea never uploads any singe bit of data, everything runs in your computer). It will probably take decades to change that.",

Of course, it is 100% free for everyone :)\n\nFor now, you can link Photopea with your Google Drive / Dropbox, and use them as the main storage (it is right at [Photopea.com](https://Photopea.com) on the left side).",

I don't need to create an account, and I can understand instantly what files I can upload to start playing with it. PNG &amp; SVG downloads look very simple.\n\nIt's very generous what you're offering and it's a good strategy but you want to be doing it right. The banner ads aren't annoying enough for me to think about paying for it. It would have to be something like a skippable video every time I want to export my project as is. So the value of purchasing it to get rid of a banner ad is not really there if getting rid of ads IS the value prop... but the ads aren't that intrusive or annoying.\n\nThe other way is to increase the value prop by adding the cloud option as suggested, which would be great for a lot of people. I prefer desktop software (or something like you have here, maybe even more as I look at it), but some designers I know have switched from Sketch to Figma because it's easier to communicate with their clients as it's hosted online. So cloud storage matters for teams especially but even solo freelancers that work with clients remotely.\n\nYou could also add new features, or you could take existing features and put them into the paid version though you may irritate and lose some older users after that.",

And 4 million users wow respect. Congrats on the success!\n\nBut it's stuff like display ads that make this unappealing to the professional crowd. Or at least makes it look cheap and untrustworthy. This may be my personal opinion as a marketing professional only btw, but I've seen plenty of successful websites and software applications that run without display ads and make good money through other means.\n\n(How Microsoft gets away with putting display ads into a paid OS, I don't understand.)\n\nDon't be shy about monetizing some of the more professional features of your software. But as you're doing, make it abundantly clear that the basic features (that 99% of users want) are free. I believe this is the way to move forward from here.\n\nIf you like, you can also go the email list route. You have plenty of users to turn into an email list for say - tips and guides on how to use Photopea. Then occasionally you could drop a paid product/affiliate link into that email list.",

            "comment": "Take this with a grain of salt, as you should any advice/feedback from random internet redditors. Also, I am approaching this from the lens of of a medium-to-large regulated organization, not a hot tech startup.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Businesses don't want \"sexy\".** Businesses want compliance features, risk mitigation, and value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* One of the main reasons I see large organizations **not** use tools, even *free* tools, is because the licensing of the tool conflicts with their legal posture or acceptable risk tolerance. I have not looked at the terms of service, privacy policy, or general licensing terms of your software, but perhaps having a business-focused version with favorable licensing terms will at the very least start removing barriers to entry.\n\n* On the risk and compliance front: Medium to large organizations, especially those in risk-adverse spaces like finance, banking, or any regulated industry, will require certain controls in place for any software (web-based or not.) For example: Just going to the photopea.com site, the first thing I am presented with are links to Google Drive, DropBox, Shared Drives, etc... This SCARES THE CRAP OUT OF ME (as a business security/risk/whatever person.) It's scary because it means any employee can, hypothetically, upload sensitive or secret documents to remote drives and exfiltrate data, and I have no control over this, and worse yet, I have no recourse from photopea.com if it happens. So what do I do? I block it entirely to reduce risk. So in this case, having a business or pro version with advanced controls on where users can store documents, how users log in (SSO with company-specific identity providers) etc... will all help ease my mind and reduce that risk.\n\n* At the risk of taking it to an extreme: As a business, I don't want to see ads in software my employees use. What if the ad shows something that's not in line with our corporate values? Why employees being advertised to during work hours, are they supposed to interact with the ads? Id rather pay for the software we need to get the compliance and risk tolerance we need.\n\nOkay all that being said, now I'm getting into more ideation/\"spitballing\":\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy would a business need your software? What problem does it solve, specifically, that can't be accomplished with MS Paint or the built in Photos app? Perhaps a value-add for businesses is not features (you have plenty) but rather *workflows*. How does this tool seamless integrate into work environment? To answer that I think you might have to answer a more fundamental question, how do your *business users* use your software? Is it mostly creative-types? Do they use your app as part of a larger workflow? Can you hook into that process to make their lives a little easier? Does it make sense to add some kind of \"web-hook\" technology to initiate workflows when images are saved/completed? No idea, my point is not to be specific to, but to illustrate a process of discovery and way of thinking. The b2b world is very different from the b2c wold.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, super congrats to the *millions* of users, that's seriously impressive.",

Although they move like an albatross, once you get them they are loathe to move on, and they are very very budget conscious.\n\nWhy would I start there?  Because one thing Adobe had going for them was the so many early students had hacked (free) or university licenses that its of zero cost to them, so they learn all their projects on those tools.  When its time for them to move on to corporate, they want to use the same tools they've already invested so much time in learning.\n\nSo smaller schools an universities use what professors tell them to buy in many instances.  You want to send a premium version to all those profs. who teach all those classes and have them suggest it or use it for their classes/assigments.  Now you have 1 person who essentially gets you 30 users who you hope can convert to premium users.\n\nSo either highschools in smaller areas or colleges that are smaller and much more likely to be lured by lower costs than their bulk adobe licenses.  Even better is if you have pre-made lessons, tutorials, etc., that teachers can use and distribute as part of their classes.\n\nSo yearbook staff, classes, etc.",

I think the browser thing is not a big deal - Figma has an app but is also browser based and hugely popular. Like others have mentioned, you should have some advanced features that are behind a paywall. You could also experiment with charging for the software and see what happens. Even if you just charged $1/month and lost half of your user base you would be making $2M/month and beating competitors by an insane margin. \n\nPersonally heres what I would do:\n\n\\-Some design work to clean up the site a bit. The landing page doesn't look professional to me - it doesn't compare at all to what you would see on Adobe, Sketch, or Figma's landing pages. Also small things like the way you are displaying ads and the location of them is pretty off-putting I think. For instance, maybe users are forced to watch an add when they try to export their project or something, rather than it being 1/4 the screen.\n\n\\-Charge to have certain pro level features, and leave the basics free and accessible. If your concern is something like the ability for teachers and students to have affordable access, maybe make it free if you sign up with an .edu email address. \n\n\\-You don't need to market to big businesses. They are going to keep using the industry standard tools, its just much easier that way. You should be marketing to the people that just want a cheap/almost free solution. Especially if you have 4 million of them already using it.",

I think that you could leave web version which is free and have ads. But try to add desktop app version which is without ads and maybe have more regular updates?  Also it cost some $. Probably one time payment (for example 29,99$-39,99$ - because affinity is around \\~50$) would be friendlier for users than subscribtion and I agree that lack of desktop app is sus for some companies.\n2. It is kinda cool that you go to [photopea.com](https://photopea.com) and you go straight to the app....but. At the same time it could be better to have like one-page site that lists features. Just help people understand that this is not a scam. This is 100% feature packed software that can (and should) be great alternative for Photoshop users. For example check Affinity site, Photoshop site, Blender site etc.\n3. If you would go for desktop app I think it would be good idea to work a little bit on UI/UX design. I mean, it's not bad. But it lacks consistency in some places. Good first impression is a key. Maybe hire someone?\n4. It will be probably really hard. But I think that good brush engine could be opportunity to get alot of new users. Right now it is pretty much imposible to compare Photopea to Photoshop, Procreate, Krita etc. when it comes to using tablet.\n5. After some improvements -&gt; work more on marketing. Youtube, Ads, Website, Deals with influencers etc. :)\n\nFor now this is all I can think about. Summary: Try desktop app. Work a little bit od UI/UX. Market your tool (do website, maybe even youtube?).",

If that works then sell more advanced courses.\n\n\\- Literally copy how photoshop makes money as much as possible (cloud storage services, purchasable filters ETC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a year or less of implementation you'd be able increase revenue I believe by a huge margin while still keeping the software free to use for the world.

Yes, you have millions of users. They won't recommend your product unless asked about it. Even then, the second point may sway the point;  \n\n* When you don't \"pay\" for something, you're also signalling that there is a potential trade off. Are you not getting as many features? Can you do as much with Photopea as you can with Photoshop? \"Surely not. Photoshop costs money but this is just operating off advertising revenue? Must just be a basic cropping piece of software. I'm running a business here and I need more sophisticated tools and as such I need to invest in the tools that are befitting of my company\".\n\nIf businesses are made aware that this is a tool for sophisticated, business-level work output and you have your product advertising appear early in the consideration process, then you should be good.  \n\n\nYou only need people to use it once for it to become a habit, so you need to advertise to people who have not heard of it before or not considered before.\n\nAlso - this one is thought for people to understand, 95% of potential clients are not in the market right now. That is the largest base to advertise to and if you advertise digitally, probably the cheapest as you're not getting charged for consideration when people are already in the decision funnel. But it needs to be repeated. Over a period of time. A number of times.",

This is like the early days of Slack, where individual employees were reasonable for introducing Slack to their company, and the sales team would then sell to the bosses.\n\nStarter idea: to make this work, you\u2019d need company/team features.

The speed at which I can do something instead of waiting for Creative Cloud to boot up is insane. \n\nFrom a business perspective though, we still actively pay for and use CC for many reasons, but one of the biggest is access control and integrations. I was chatting with a few folks recently about this and one of them put it like this:\n\n&gt; the best piece of advice I ever got when it came to B2B product management in my startup is that what businesses pay for is control..\n\n&gt; So features are not just save in the cloud, but control access to who can see it. Multiple people working on something, who can see what? Create a workflow for people to comment and approve images..\n\nI think something like that would be incredibly attractive to businesses, though would of course mean a lot more work on the \"server\" instead of being primarily client side.\n\n---\n\nAs another note, if you wanted to reduce your static hosting costs and also serve the content from a tonne more regions (providing an even better experience for all of your users), take a look at something like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify - you might even be able to eliminate your hosting costs entirely! I think /u/gregbrimble is hanging around in the comments here and should be able to get you onboarded onto Cloudflare Pages super quickly if you're interested!",

            "comment": "Here are some thoughts to help you grow your business. These are draft ideas.\n\nFirst of all, it's essential to understand what your main competition is doing. Of course, I'd like to talk about elephant in the room - Adobe, best known for products like Photoshop, Illustrator, and many others. It has a segmented market business model, with slight differences between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at individuals, small/medium businesses, and enterprises that wish to use digital media and marketing services for varying purposes. One of their most impressive moves was their transition from a licensed software company to an entirely cloud-based company. I'm sure it was an arduous process, but Adobe did it. As of 2021, approximately 26 Million subscribers are using Adobe Photoshop.\n\nI'm sure you know more about Adobe than I do, given that this is your main competitor. You are already using some of the best monetization practices, such as displaying ads in the application, premium subscription, and licensing.\n\nI want to give you a different perspective on SaaS Marketing, perhaps, help you understand how to improve and scale your current state. You see, working with SaaS businesses, I've noticed that most owners are obsessed with the product. They have Product Managers and Engineers developing great new features, yet they lack understanding of user experience and customer support. Your promotional and advertising strategy should portray a situation where the Photopea products help the client innovatively achieve their design targets. The creativity aspect is what you should be emphasizing in the commercials.\n\nChannels\nThere is no \"Silver Bullet\" channel out there. Either one of these: Social Media, SEO, PR, or Content Marketing, can give you great results. Study shows that multi-channel marketing allows brands to expand their reach and interact with prospective customers who may not use the single platform targeted via single-channel marketing. Multi-touch attribution modeling is the key to identifying the proper weight and budget allocation across platforms and channels.\n\nPartnerships\nI also wanted to talk about another product that I think can be a great partner to you - Canva. \"Canva is an Australian graphic design platform used to create social media graphics, presentations, posters, documents, and other visual content. I love this tool, despite concerns that it's harming the graphic design industry because the output of the design by Canva is too homogenized. Photopea can help Canva's users create more sophisticated techniques in graphic design. Just a thought... :)\n\nTargeting\nIndividual Users with interest in web/graphic design (Free with Ads Version)\nBusiness Owners, Marketers, Professionals and non-designers in general (Pro Version)\nOnline Courses, Universities (Free with Ads Version / Student Discount Pro Version)\nEnterprise: CMO, VP of Marketing, Director's of Marketing, etc... (Licensing)\n\nPhotopea is a powerful image editing software, and I am using it for editing work myself. It's an excellent tool with its capabilities. Thank you for that! Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions or would like to continue this conversation via Zoom or other video conference tools.",

It's an easy low barrier go-to. \n\nYou could update your licence terms that the tool is only allowed to be used for free non commercial use. Make it clear on the site, and give people the option to upgrade.\n\nSure people will use it anyway, but medium to large companies don't want to use unlicenced software in their company. It's even one of the score criteria for some standards certification, including Cyber Essentials.\n\nIf you couple these licence changes with a few decent features that businesses would want but that they have to pay for, then you are onto a winner. \n\nFor example, you could allow people to embed your tool into Atlassian Confluence or something like that, so that the asset can both display in the wiki, and be edited direct from source. Maintaining a single source of truth can be difficult for art assets in company wikis like this so could get some traction (though I'm speculating). \n\nOr charge to provide a link between the tool and where the files are stored, such as drive, Dropbox, or maybe your own storage engine. I'm sure some businesses would pay to keep all image assets in one place in a way that can be shared between the team (similar to how Figma does it). As a business owner myself, I don't want people creating assets that others in the team can't access or get value from.\n\nIf you did make a popular Atladsian extension then there is also the chance they see that and look to buy you like they did with Trello. They don't currently have a graphics offering and I'm sure it could fit in their ecosystem somehow.",

Their main designers will need photoshop.  You won't compete with those.  But for all of the other people, instead of paying 25 USD per month for a license, they can pay 25 USD per year.  And that gives them 90% of the featureset that photoshop doesn't give them. \n* As an alternative B2B model, try offering your solution to companies that require image editing for their users.  For example: Shopify now allows you to send newsletter.  Go to shopify, and create a product so that their users can edit their images in a full pop-up with good capabilities.   That way their users don't have to leave their site.  Shopify is one example but there are many many others that require image editing. \n* Sell a wordpress or shopify plug-in so that users have photoshop-like capabilities. \n* Sell cloud storage\n* Sell premium export (&gt; 640x640)\n* Have a price and then waive that price for education \n* Look at what diagrams.net does for privacy (it allows you to run a local version if you're concerned about privacy). \n* Look at what canva does, and create premium designs that you can sell.  \n* Ask for donations (help keep us free) and ask for testimonials from schools.  \n* You're not going to like this but: check out how canva's workflow is.  You can do a lot without creating an account, but every step is an opportunity for them to monetize and for them to remind you to create an account.  \n\n&gt; In short, it feels like some companies are paying for software X, which nobody uses, and employees end up using software Y, for which nobody pays.\n\nDon't be discouraged, this is exactly what zoom did, and why it is so popular.  Every company paid for webex, everybody hated webex and used the paid version of zoom.  Once they noticed what had happened, it was too late.",

I think an ongoing monthly fee would not be a good thing, it's the big deterrent for photoshop in my opinion. Having it being an online tool only makes me fearful that one day you'll just pull the plug and the tool is gone. If there was a stand alone version that I could buy for say $20 or $30 then I'd know that it would be on my computer forever. \n\nCloud saving of files could be a nice premium feature. Especially sharing and collaborating with fellow users.\n\nAs it works great on Chromebooks. I wonder if you could partner with a Chromebook manufacturer to be included on every Chromebook. This way every student who gets one will become familiar with your product right off the bat. \n\nI love your work mate. \n\nbtw, if I could ask for a feature request. as a 3D artist. Having the ability to convert an image to a normal map is super useful. There is an nDo Action script that I use in photoshop, but having something like that built into Photopea would be really helpful and I think it would help make you more attractive to the the video game sector, at least the indie game sector. Then it could be recommended along side unity, unreal and blender.",

            "comment": "I've used the tool a lot and I'm super amused to meet it's creator here. I have a couple of ideas - \n\n1. Rebranding: Photopea and the overall branding and design and ui/ux makes it comparable to some of the other tools that are quick fixes on the web but not tools that people depend upon. I would change this to give Photopea its own identity, than to portray it as a free Photoshop-esque tool on the cloud. I, personally, think that Photopea could very well be a huge alternative for companies that use tools like Canva Premium but Canva is quite limiting in its functionality and Photopea could come to the rescue and so positioning yourself in that angle will probably be better as a cloud based tool, compared to being a Photoshop alternative.\n\n2. Adaptability: One thing that companies like Adobe cannot do but you surely implement is to add custom branding and other features to the websites. Companies are ready to pay any amount of money for a software/tool that has their logo and looks like it was made bespoke for them. If you can sell packages that achieve this, I think that would be huge. Use Photopea's cloud-based flexibility to your advantage and give companies what they want.\n\n3. Target Audience: I think after the pandemic, a lot more companies are moving their operations online and doing it remotely. On top of that, divisions like social media are completely outsourced to teams that may not even be in the same country. I believe you should Target these firms in particular that are focusing a lot more on remote workflows than physical offices, because they probably require a lot of these tools but don't want to pay for individual licenses for each of their remote workers, so you could make a plan that would fit this need.\n\nI have a few more ideas and I would absolutely love to talk to you more about them, being a huge fan of Photopea, if your dms are open to it!",

It will probably take decades to change that.\n\nMost businesses I have worked for use ancient software, because they are tried and tested, therefore reliable. The hottest and \"sexiest\" software will never be used in large scale businesses (in my experience).\n\nPermitting a downloadable version that is resistant to automatic updates should inch you closer to your goal.

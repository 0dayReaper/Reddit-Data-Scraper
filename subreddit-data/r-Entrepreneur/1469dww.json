    "postText": "Designjoy is one of the most successful solo design agencies doing things differently marketing as a subscription design service. Think Netfix for design.  \n\n\nHow inclined are business owners to subscribe to a service instead of hiring a traditional agency or freelancer?  \n\n\nAlso, would it be interesting to see a video subscription service, say short form video content?",

When they need him fast he is instantly available and when they need more than 20 hours they pay the regular price for those hours. \nWhen they dont need him a lot he earns a little more and he always has some steady cash flow this way.",

Their editors aren\u2019t US based, they advertise unlimited edits but only work on one project at a time and take 2-3 days to get it back to you. They\u2019re constantly hiring and firing editors so even though they claim you\u2019ll have a dedicated editor you\u2019ll constantly have someone relearning your style and look if you are making consistent content for YouTube.",

And his portfolio lacks real jobs.\n\nAnother red flags: no real testimonials; he says that works 5 hours/day. With so many clients? I don't think it's possible. Or his clients don't demand him work.",

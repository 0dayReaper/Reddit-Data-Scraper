    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am 47 years old. I run a design studio in New York. I opened an online store at the suggestion of a friend. The difference from Amazon is that it does not need to accumulate too much inventory. After the customer places an order I pay for the goods and then ship the goods on the platform. After waiting for the customer to receive the goods, I receive the profit difference that belongs to me. In the past few months, my monthly profit has been between 40K and 80K. I am now considering whether to close My studio concentrates on running my online store, do you have any good suggestions for this?",

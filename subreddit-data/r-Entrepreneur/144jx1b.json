    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been working in recruitment for several years, and I've finally made the decision to start my own company\u2014an **agency that specializes in sourcing top-notch talent from Central and Eastern Europe** (CEE).\n\nThe idea is to source 3 top candidates based on the client's needs where he ends up paying a one-time fee only if he hires one of the candidates.\n\nI'm in need of your creative input for naming the company. Please vote for one of the options provided.\n\nSince branding and marketing aren't my strong suits, I would greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions. \n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/144jx1b)",

Sounds like it's targeting students looking for university choices. \n\nVirtly is also catchy, but limits you to a perception of remote workers only. Why limit your opportunities for the future? Maybe you can reach a point where you change the business model and help transfer talent from CEE. \n\nPolarpoint sounds like a winter activity clothes brand. We2You is too vague and also not too SEO friendly. \nPasteer sounds religious.\n\nI would say Borderlessly ticks the box for both companies and the labour you would onboard.",

I want to start moving toward building this into either an app or website. First question is - how do you decide if it should be an app or a website? I like website because no download is necessary. But I like app because I expect that people will use this on a monthly basis. But still, maybe website is fine. Second question - I\u2019m non technical, and I\u2019ve been asking some engineer friends about how to build this, and I get lots of opinions but nothing really useful. How do I build this? Contractors? And how do I do this at low cost? What\u2019s the best strategy here?",

            "comment": "Hi u/LawScuulJuul  \nThis is actually my professional specialty. Very exciting to be able to help here. Heres a few things to consider and some actionable items to take away. For reference, when I say \u201cproduct\u201d below, I mean the app you are building.  \nFirst and foremost, CONGRATS! This is a really exciting albeit somewhat terrifying place to be in! Now to the work part.I would start with a POC (Proof of Concept) with a ux designer or agency. It might seem hard to justify design before actual development, but I can tell you from experience, it is worth it. The cost savings of not taking iterations through development could equate to thousands in savings over the start of a product.So here\u2019s the TLDR list in case your brain works like mine  \nProduct Design  \n\\* Make a proof of concept with an interactive prototype  \n\\* Shop that prototypes around to as many as you can/want.\tBe certain to include users that WOULDN\u2019T normally use the software you plan to deploy. External opinions in this (called UX Research) can be some of the best a product will get/ save time and money / make a better product.Pay attention to feedback, not if they like it or not.  \n\\* \tEveryone loves their brainchild, but DON\u2019T TAKE IT PERSONAL when someone doesn\u2019t like it. Simply ask. Why don\u2019t you love the product? And then shut the hell up and listen. Remember, those people and their feedback could be savings/making you tons of money if this takes off.  \n\\* Implement the feedback. (Fancy way of saying take some time to relax, think about your feedback, and make an action plan on how to improve the product, then go improve it)  \n\\* Second round of proof of concept - small changes with big impact  \nDevelopment  \n\\* Slow and steady. Do NOT rush production on a new product.  \n\\* Start with a web app.\tIt gives you the ability to test in a myriad of situations and, usually written in JavaScript languages or the similar, can be \u201cported\u201d or easily rewritten to a stand-alone app.   \nProduct Growth / Roadmap  \n\\* If still see a \u201cproduct-market fit\u201d meaning you see the potential to sell this product and not just a really cool idea, start to consider what funding might look like. Can you go out of pocket slowly? Are you open to bringing on an investor? If so, at what capacity? Are you ready for the commitment of being a \u201ctech founder\u201d? Do you have a backup plan if this fails? which it won\u2019t, but still be prepared.  \n\\* START ROADMAPPING - This is great for your visibility, but also something you can share that brings value to a potential investor.  \n\\* Roadmapping is exactly what it sounds like. You are building a map of what product stages and improvements you would like to make. I might suggest re-engaging your product (UX) designer and tapping into their skillset. The roadmap involves a lot of new feature ideation which product designers tend to be strong at when you can\u2019t afford or justify a product manager.Repeat the cycle above.",

            "comment": "Developing software cost allot plus some companies are working on apples and some are working on Microsoft. Website support both of them, less work, less drama and support. Start with a website and see if your idea actually works. I don\u2019t really use it but most of the business company I know uses QlikTech, Qlikview for their HRM, CRM demos. It doesn\u2019t demand much programming skills and you can ofcourse use chatGPT if needed.",

            "comment": "App development is more expensive, time-consuming, and stressful (you must pass Apple and Android reviews). Your product does not have a product-market fit yet, so you should build a web app to check if someone besides has the same problem, and wants to pay to solve this problem. I created a lot of web apps, the hard part is to bring a lot of people and convince them to pay for the product. DM's open if you want to chat more.",

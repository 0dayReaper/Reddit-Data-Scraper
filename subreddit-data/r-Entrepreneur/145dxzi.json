Health has held me back and I am so low and down and just need something to help me believe in myself to pull myself up, try and earn a big chunk quickly as I can. \n\nGot through 6 months of chemo, 15 rounds of radio therapy, 10 years of medication, and raised two children single handedly, whilst having ADHD, and other challenges. \n\nI don't know what to start. Any advice?",

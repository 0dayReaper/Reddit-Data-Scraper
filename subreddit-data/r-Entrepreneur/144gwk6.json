    "postText": "My wife is an experienced Hair Professional making really good money and already managing her current salon she works at. Long story short but getting out of there is vital and she is more than ready to have her own salon.\n\nWhat I'm finding is difficult in getting a business loan for this as the salon when it starts needs capital but won't have business history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonal loans are an option but a lot say they can't be used for business and I wonder if doing so would break the law which I absolutely do not want to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately as a business that requires a physical space to serve customers we need capital right away and just don't have enough personal money to pay for the startup costs all at once. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has her heart set on doing this, we have found a great space and had money lined up until economic stuff made them back out. I really want to be supportive and helpful without doing something reckless. Any advice?",

            "comment": "You're going to struggle to get a loan. Just how it is right now.\n\n\nPersonal capital may be the best option, and if you can't do it right now, right now might not be the right time to start.\n\n\nI encourage the idea of her opening a salon: she's got the skill and she's got the drive. But this is a long process, not one that you can jump into right away. If that means she needs to exit the current salon and find another one for the time being with the long term goal being savings for her startup, then that's your decision.\n\n\nIt's more than the obvious expenses. You need the space and the tools yes, but what about advertising? What about professional services like accounting and a lawyer? What legal filing fees are there for her industry? I know hair salons are regulated tightly compared to other industries. Website design and hosting? Appointment booking and bookkeeping software?\n\n\nThe point isn't to discourage but to emphasize that there are hidden costs not obvious to beginners. It's going to be more expensive than it initially seems and you'll want to have capital on hand to back that up.",

Those are not too hard to find online and there's a lot. Can cost you in the 1K+ range but you shouldn't be spending 5 figure on it.\n\nas to the 2nd point, use the personal loan for the business, consider hiring a lawyer &amp; financial advisor just for an hour of consultation to give you peace of mind because you don't actually need to be spending much on them right now. $200+ spent on this between the two, shouldn't spend more than 3 figures.",

    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI have a small pill box idea, and an engineer has helped me to finish the 3d drawings. Now, I'm all set to move forward with prototyping and considering a small production run of around 20 pieces. I know this quantity is pretty low, and after doing some research, I noticed that many product designers opt for 3D printing. However, the manufacturer I'm working with, RapidDirect, suggested using vacuum casting instead. [https://www.rapiddirect.com/services/vacuum-casting/](https://www.rapiddirect.com/services/vacuum-casting/)\n\nThey claim that this technology is perfect for small-run plastic prototypes and delivers excellent surface finishes. So, should I stick with 3D printing or give vacuum casting a shot? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this!",

It's a simple trial batch to verify if you're on to something, so no need to get fancy about it.\n\nIf money is less of an issue I'd just tell them to send both versions. Time is also a resource, and being able to compare the options will save you time and make you more confident in your choice going forward.\n\nIf you got the files yourself I would also consider finding a local maker space with a 3D-printer, or buying one myself. To iterate design updates quicker while in this prototyping phase.",

            "comment": "Your decision between 3D printing and vacuum casting should primarily depend on factors such as the quality you're aiming for, the cost, time, and the future scalability of your product.\r\n\n3D Printing: excellent for rapid prototyping, allowing for quick design iterations with relatively low cost for very small quantities. It's especially useful when you're still tweaking the design or testing the functionality. However, the finish might not be as high quality as other methods, and for larger quantities, it can get expensive and time-consuming.\r\n\nVacacum Casting: higher quality prototypes or small production runs. It's more cost-effective for larger quantities (compared to 3D printing), and the parts produced can have a superior finish and more closely represent the final product. The upfront cost is higher due to the need for creating a mold, but per-unit cost decreases with volume.\r  \n\r  \nGiven that you're looking to do a small production run of 20 pieces, and if your design is final, vacuum casting could be a good fit. The quality of the products produced would likely be higher than 3D printed versions, and you could get a better idea of what the final product would look like.\r  \n\r  \nIn either case, consider the future scalability of your product. If you anticipate needing to adjust your design based on the results of your small run, 3D printing might be better since it allows for more flexibility. If you're fairly confident in your design and anticipate scaling up production in the future, vacuum casting could be more cost-effective and provide a higher quality result.",

    "postText": "Hi\n***EDIT: IM STARTING A BUSINESS INSTEAD***\nI am currently 20 years old and I'm about to buy a car as the one I currently have, I've had since I got my license and its just not good anymore(yes has actual problems). I got about \u00a37k to my name.\nI am a car fanatic so now my question is: do I buy a car and make a youtube channel start uploading videos everywhere(youtube, instagram, tiktok etc) and try to grow?\nOr do I spend a few thousands get another shit box and try to open a business with the rest? I am still in university got 1 more year. I wouldn't know what business to start.\nI know the obvious answer would be start a business however I feel like I'm only young once and if I dont get a car to enjoy id regret later on as you never know what life brings you and obviously the car could bring me money from social media.",

The most successful people you know worked hard and got lucky, you can't control luck, the lotto is full of people trying very hard to be lucky. Bill Gates was both, Richard Brandon, Steve Jobs, all got both. Warren Buffet worked hard, worked the numbers. Ted Turner worked hard. \n\nPutting effort into building something is more likely to bring you profit and prosperity than luck or mooching off someone else's profit model.",

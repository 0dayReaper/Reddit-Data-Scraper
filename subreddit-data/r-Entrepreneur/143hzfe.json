Kinda tough to pull off in the summer though given that it\u2019s still light out until 10pm so my circadian rhythm isn\u2019t exactly cooperating with my ideal schedule. \n\nAnyways, I was just curious what you other self-employed folks do for hours in the summer. \n\nExcited to hear!",

Get up at 5-530, feed the dogs, take them for a walk, go to the gym, come home and shower, go to work, knock off around lunch time, cook and eat lunch, play video games, do some chores and/or work, cook and eat dinner, do a little more work, play with the dogs, and then TV and bed.",

I'm currently a freelance web developer for a family friend, who is paying me to make a website while also learning more web development. I (try) to wake up around 7am, eat breakfast, go to the gym around 8:30am, am there till about 10am (longer workouts, I've got a partner so we take a bit longer for switching weights), then get started fully around 11am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in a lucky position right now working about 30 hours a week, so I work about 11am-4pm everyday, occasionally more, sometimes less. If I feel that I could do more work that week, or didn't hit 30 hours, Ill just do some extra things on the weekend.",

I can never make it past 10-20 minutes. It\u2019s only on bad days though, usually I\u2019m wrecked by this time. Like right now. It\u2019s light as heck outside but my eyes are screaming at me to sleep. I also have a very active day, physically and mentally, so by this time I\u2019m pretty much ready yes or yes. Even if I\u2019m trying to have a night out I\u2019m too tired now. Literally dying as I type this. But those guided meditations are pretty strong stuff haha. Also helps I\u2019m actually interested in some so it makes me actually try what they say. Can never make it to the actual topic part though, I\u2019m always out on the \u201crelaxation\u201d part \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. It\u2019s pretty good considering my room is very light, no dark shades.",

            "comment": "Hello there! It's interesting to see the various routines that fellow self-employed folks have. Being based in Australia, my schedule might seem a little different due to the opposite seasons we're experiencing.  \nCurrently, it's winter here, so I usually start work pretty early, around 6 am (after the gym). This allows me to get a solid chunk of focused writing work done before the day fully kicks into gear on my side project - [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe). From 8-4pm I usually work on my start-up, and finish around 4-5 pm to enjoy the evenings, which get dark pretty early this time of year. I am in bed by 8:30pm.  \nHowever, when it's summer and the days are longer, my schedule does shift a bit. I maintain my early start, but I also take an afternoon break when it gets really hot, then get back to work from 8-10 pm when it's cooler and quieter. This has worked out quite well for me, giving me a nice balance of work and personal time throughout the day. I get my gym and focus work in prior to the heat, then have a short burst until early afternoon, then resume again in the evening.  \nSpeaking of routines, I'm curious - have you found any unique or unconventional practices among self-employed individuals in maintaining work-life balance? I think the beauty of our paths is that there's no one-size-fits-all; we're continually learning and adjusting.  \nCheers and keep enjoying your summer - wish it was warmer here!",

Sleep or watch youtube/netflix/whatever till 10.30 AM then walk my dog. Comeback make coffee, check emails or give calls to my clients. If there is any work pass it down to the team. Play video games while sipping down my coffee. Attend meetings and keep a check on work progress after. 5.30 PM take reports on work done then everyone logs out. We do WFH so no commute to office for now.\n\nIn between my wedding and adjusting to a married life I have worked less than 25 hours since Feb 23'. But I'm no stranger to pulling in 60 - 80 hour weeks and my business is at a pivot point so I'll probably be working harder in coming months.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m creating this website as a marketplace for people to buy/sell their new/used golf equipment and golf related items.  It\u2019s similar to ebay but won\u2019t be auction and the feeds will be 9% instead of 13%.  Shipping will be UPS and USPS ground only.  I\u2019m hoping the lower fees will be attractive to people who sell to keep a little more money in their pocket rather than give it away.  We should be up and running in July",

            "comment": "One of the things with a network based business like this is having an established base of users. Is 4% going to cause someone to switch from ebay (with 1,000,000's of potential buyers and cash within a week) to your site?  \n\n\nWhat's your marketing and growth strategy? Do you already have connections in the golf world or are you starting fresh?  \n\n\nI like the concept, but just a 4% discount probably isn't enough to move the needle if you don't have something like a \"cash guarantee within a week\" (even if low-balling), but then that begs the question of whether you have the working capital to take on inventory like that and sit on it until a buyer does come along.",

It\u2019s just another platform for people to list their items.  If they want to or don\u2019t want to that\u2019s up to them.  I\u2019m offering a lower fee (you can only go so low because of credit card fees).  I do sell golf clubs currently as a hobby and will continue, I have people I know in a few different states that work at various courses and shops that I get first choice of clubs they get traded in.  This site won\u2019t be mainly for me and I\u2019m also not trying to or expecting everyone to stop using eBay, I know it\u2019s a tall order but I feel another spot they can list items with a little bit lower fee is worth a shot.   Even if I can get 1% of the eBay golf listers to post on mine the first year it\u2019s a win",

My point is that it could be difficult to garner enough interest at just a 4% discount (people ignore a 10% discount for email sign ups all the time for something they intend to purchase).  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I love the idea of getting 1% of eBay traffic, but what's your plan/strategy to actually convince them to create *another* online account, login, password, etc.? Just 4% savings (call it $8 on a $200 club or $20 on a $500 set of irons) makes it tough to justify the switch if the *only* benefit is 4%. That's all.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I hope I'm wrong and you find great success -- just offering a friendly challenge to think more strategically about how you will quickly build a network that actually moves product for users",

As far as sellers not caring about lower fees most people on eBay that I\u2019ve seen are ones that are constantly selling on there, not just one item and they\u2019re done.  That 4% may not seem like a lot but it would add up quick if you\u2019re selling 20-30 items at $200 a piece.  I saw the amount of clubs ebay had listed and I got tired of the fees so I decided to do this.  Thanks for the input I appreciate it and there is always stuff to think about",

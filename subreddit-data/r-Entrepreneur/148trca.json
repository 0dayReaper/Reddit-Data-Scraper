I've looked into working with a marketing company but because this is a foreign area to me I don't know who to hire or where to start from.",

I have done some of the above already, though, I do not want to start social media marketing on my own, Instagram, especially isn't what it used to be. Hashtags and etc. do not work as well as they did a few years ago. This is where my question lies actually.\n\nLastly, the subscription box is something separate from the family apparel business I mentioned above.",

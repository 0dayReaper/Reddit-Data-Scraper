It's called Systems Sync and the idea came about as I've often found myself overwhelmed with the number of systems my business was juggling. I figured I can't be the only one and I was right!   \nThe concept is a simple, user-friendly tech audit to give founders a comprehensive view of all the systems they're currently using in their business, provide insights on how they can be streamlined, and suggest ways to make operations more efficient and secure, ultimately cutting down on unnecessary costs and wasted time.   \nI'm launching a beta version next week and I'm looking for some honest feedback on concept, landing page, everything. I genuinely want to make this something that can benefit entrepreneurs, and I also want to learn from this first launch experience as it's a different way of working for me.   \nI'm grateful for any tips or insight or feedback! If you're interested, you can check it out here: [www.diamondminds.co.uk/systems-audit](https://www.diamondminds.co.uk/systems-audit)   \nI really appreciate any support or feedback from this community - I'm a longtime lurker on my other account and am working on pushing myself out of my comfort zone!",

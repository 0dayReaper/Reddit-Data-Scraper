    "postText": "Hello!  \nBillSlice is an online platform (web app) that simplifies shared monthly bills between friends and family. BillSlice does this by offering:  \n\\- Bill splitting between 2-10 people  \n\\- Automatic notifications for upcoming/due/late bills  \n\\- In-app payments/auto-pay  \n\\- Easy payment tracking\n\nThe web app is currently in beta but is fully functional. I am searching for my first 100 users.\n\nThere are many bill splitting apps out there, but none that are built for managing recurring bills.  \nThe best way I can describe it is, if you have a one time payment use Venmo, if you are on a group trip, use SplitWise, and if you have monthly bills with other people, use BillSlice.\n\nI am looking for users that can help provide me feedback over the next coupe months.\n\n**Common bills that people share are:**\n\n\\- Rent  \n\\- TV Streaming Services (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, ect)- Cell phone plans  \n\\- Spotify  \n\\- Gaming Subscriptions (Nintendo Switch, Xbox, ect)  \n\\--------------  \nIf you are interested, the link to the website is: [https://billslice.io](https://billslice.io)\n\nIf you would like to chat first and want to see a demo, DM me and we can setup a time.\n\nI hope BillSlice can prove useful to you!",

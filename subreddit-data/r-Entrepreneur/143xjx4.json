    "postText": "Hey all, I don't know if I'm doing this correctly so l'm sorry if my post isn't made well. I'm (23m) financing my sister (28f) to start a company. Paying around $16,000 to start it. I am mostlv doing it because I want her to be successful. I'm completely fine with not seeing a penny of it come back. But I'd like to know what percentage of the revenue would be fair to ask for in return for financing it.\nI don't want to go into a ton of detail, but it's a business where she would be hiring people to fulfill her clients needs. She would mostly just be responsible for management and bringing on new clients.\nI'd like to help her whenever I can, but assuming I don't help at all with the business. What would be fair?\n\nEdit: I forgot my birthday passed and put 22 lol",

This business has the potential to be doing millions on just 20 clients or so. So I\u2019d also love to have a stake in it as well if it does good. I\u2019m sure people say this and it doesn\u2019t go that way, but I\u2019m positive the business wouldn\u2019t effect our relationship. I am 100% fine on my own.",

Handing success to people merely creates a fall from a greater height.\n\n&gt;But I'd like to know what percentage of the revenue would be fair to ask for in return for financing it.\n\nAnd making it relative-proof? Near one hundred percent. This is wildly off-kilter but fits in nicely with the wantrepreneur's eternal -- if quixotic -- quest for a magic money machine. Business owners have a job, it's not just sitting around 'owning' stuff.\n\nYour sister's job is making important decisions and *making them right*.\n\nThen there is the tendency of people who should know better, demanding they put their greasy fingers all over something they simply can not comprehend the workings of. But of course you don't have a million dollars to drop into a trust fund ... so I sort of understand the wrong-headed intentions. You know ... the good intentions which pave that highway to hell.\n\nI love that there is no context to this at all, this 'sister' has no preferences, tendencies, motivations, professional background, personality nor cares. And what is the right business tailor made for a total stranger to own? The magical thinking business of course.\n\nNever buy a business just to gift yourself (or anyone else) a job they can't possibly lose, for you will learn otherwise.\n\n[A Very Bad Start For Your Company \u2014 The Cargo Cult Anti-Pattern](https://blog.neap.co/a-very-bad-start-for-your-company-the-cargo-cult-anti-pattern-22b050fb6f58)",

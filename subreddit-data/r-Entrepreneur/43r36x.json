I've been getting mad amounts of requests, phone calls, PM's, LinkedIn invites, and more. Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NxtLvlWeb) for more of this stuff. I'll definitely be following this up for you guys with a detailed post of how I did so well with business networking events due to the amount of requests I got for it. Thanks for the Reddit Gold, and thanks for being so supportive!**\n\nHi guys,\n\nI run a small/mid-sized web development &amp; online marketing agency. I wanted to share my process that brought me from 0 customers to a solo-entrepreneur making about $120k/year with you all, because there are a lot of people out there looking to start a business or keep it going! I told some others in r/Entrepreneur that I would give a write up on how I used cold calls to get started and push through the first 2 years of beginning a business from nothing. \n\nI have since incorporated and grown a lot, and don't cold call very often. However, I still get into big companies through cold calls, and had a meeting last week with one of the biggest fish I've ever sat in front of as a result of a cold call - I just hate making them and so use this strategy infrequently. I love referrals and people calling me!\n\n*Author\u2019s note: I finished writing this post, and it is nearly 3,100 words. I put my heart and my soul into writing this for you guys. Maybe there is a person out there that will be inspired to take this even further than I did. If that is you, don\u2019t forget to share! All glory to my savior Jesus Christ for leading me to where I am. Without God showing me the path, I couldn\u2019t share it with you!*\n\n**First, the (short) story:** \n&gt; I was an EMT and volunteer firefighter in California back in 2010. I was working in the emergency room of a hospital and had a **really** tough Monday - lots of death, blood, and more. I decided the only reason I wanted to be a firefighter was because of the retirement (residual) income. If I could do it faster another way, my mind just opened to it. Queue my brother-in-law coming back from a trip to the east coast and telling me about a business opportunity. I started selling websites for another company (which is a really terrible summary of what actually happened, but it's short).\n\nWhen I started, I didn't have ANY money to spare. I had about $5,000 worth of \"emergency fund\" that I could live on, and my wife worked and brought in about 1800/mo after taxes. Our bills cost about 3000/mo, so I needed to come up with at least 1200/mo to survive by selling websites. I ended up resorting to the only thing that costs no money: **Cold Calls!**\n\n**TL;DR: Make cold calls, even if you're terrible like I was. Use my script (Link below). Record data. Follow up. Profit.**\n\nThe idea of picking up a phone and calling a stranger to solicit them to purchase something I was selling made me feel sick. I was also scared of the rejection, and justified my position with every \"logical\" argument that I could think of. But when you're on a time clock that ends in homelessness and starvation (or failure), you've got to man (or lady) up and do it.\n\n**Some stats and info**\nThese are my statistics based on what I recorded. I don\u2019t have excel spreadsheets of data to link\u2026 Only my company\u2019s existence and some old notepads with my first call logs to prove these things, lol. My current URL is [NextLevelWeb.com](http://nextlevelweb.com), though we are currently in the middle of a re-brand and the website may not be fully functional for anyone that goes to see it yet!\n\n* I talked to a person about 70% of the time, so if you want to base my stats on actual people I talked to on a cold call, it\u2019s actually 3.25%. This means that for every 100 conversations, I made 3.25 website sales. My conversion rate including non-answers was 2.5%. I counted all non-answers in my daily calls too.\n* I tried to make 50 calls per day in a 4 hour time-frame, which calculates out to 250 calls/week (assuming Mon-Fri only). The actual number was around 150-200 in action, because I got lazy some days and hurt feelings other days. In addition, making follow-up calls (which don\u2019t count towards these \u201c50 calls per day\u201d) got to be pretty time consuming eventually. Sometimes I\u2019d make 15 of these in a day, and they took even more brainpower than a cold call sometimes due to them being a longer call.\n* The best time to call was the hours of 9AM \u2013 11:30. The hour of 10-11am was the best. I\u2019d typically make calls from 8am-noon.\n* My time to closing my first sale ended up being 2.5 months. I think the 17th call I made eventually led to my first sale. I made it in November, and it didn\u2019t close until mid-January. I eventually shortened this cycle to 2 weeks - 1 month, but I really sucked at calls, talking to people on the phone, etc. at first, so I needed more time and more numbers to start. If this proves anything, you can be absolutely horrible at this like I was and still make it happen!\n* In all the time I did calls, and it must\u2019ve been thousands of them, I made 0 sales on the first call. I wasn\u2019t trying to make them on the 1st call, which is a part of my process outlined below (small commitments leading to larger commitments).\n* My market area is San Diego County, California. While there are a ton of big businesses here that make money, there are many small businesses that are 1-5 employees, and these people were who I was trying to target at the time. \n* I was selling a website product for another company at this time (MLM/Network Marketing deal). The average ticket price was between $1,200 \u2013 3,000 each, and my take was around 70% of that. So, assuming an average take-home of $1,050 (Which was common), that meant that each 100 dials would eventually net me about $2,625.\n* Every time I was told \u201cno,\u201d I assigned a value to it. I\u2019ll save you the math, but at first, each time I heard that word, it was worth about $10 to me. When I got going, each \u201cno\u201d was worth closer to $35 each, because every no led me to someone that says yes! Not every call ended in a yes or no \u2013 sometimes it was the dreaded \u201csend me an e-mail and give me a week to think about it\u201d which is not yes or no.\n* I was closing the deal myself, because people wanted to know that they got to deal with me \u2013 The idea that I was some salesperson that wouldn\u2019t care if the product I sold worked or not is an appalling idea to a business owner. They wanted to know I was their account manager, too, which is something I carry forward in my agency now. If a salesperson sells, they get to maintain the relationship and ensure the client is satisfied, too.\n\n**Where I found my list to call:**\n\n**The local Chamber of Commerce websites.** They always have a business directory that includes the business owner's name, their current website, the correct phone number, etc. Very good and current source of info, you can start local, and you can use the fact that you found them through the Chamber as a positive thing. Just search for the site on Google -- [city] + chamber of commerce (i.e. - San Diego Chamber of Commerce). Often times, there are 300-1,000 businesses right there, and every one of them has the business owner\u2019s name, a phone number to call, and website address to investigate further.\n\n**Local free/low-cost networking meetings/groups.** I actually wasted a LOT of precious time at local meetup groups - most people were poor like me, and they were only looking to sell (not to buy or refer)! I found these through [www.meetup.com](www.meetup.com). I\u2019d actually recommend against going to these if you\u2019re purely focused on trying to sell stuff. There are other, better networking events you can attend (I have an entire process for networking events that has made me even more than cold calling \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll share that next?)!\n\n**The local business directory book that gets delivered.** You can even use one from last year.\n\n**Local magazines delivered to communities.**\n\n**Googling things like \u201cChiropractors in 92008.\u201d** Some people have more money than others, and so I\u2019d spend some time creating a list from googling a profession + zip code. Often times, it produces some decent results.\n\n**How I qualified my list:**\n\nThis is going to be a bit specific to my niche, which was selling websites (and later online marketing services) to businesses. However, you can also qualify your list so that you are talking to more of the right people and spending less time calling/talking with the wrong people!\n\n* I looked at their website. If the website looked old or had an old date at the bottom of the site (aka \u00a92012 when it's 2016), that was a good candidate for calling. If the website was newer, I'd pass on it (though if it was somewhat new, this was a good candidate for online marketing services).\n* They had to be local places/people. I didn't want to be that call you get from an out-of-state number, because those calls get ignored. Local calls get answered.\n\n**How I documented calls &amp; results:**\n\n&gt; A note on this: If you don't record who you called and what happened, you won't be able to follow up, and consequently won't make it anywhere. You need to be able to follow up on people and call numbers that didn't answer the first time or you\u2019ll run out of decent numbers to call.\n\n* I opened up a word doc on my computer, numbered a list, and copy/pasted the info if I found the info online or typed it in manually if it was from a magazine/directory/business card. My first notes were actually on a yellow legal pad. I'll get a pic of them, because I still have them somewhere, but digital is best. CRM systems are great, but it's more important to make the darn call and be marginally organized than to be highly organized and sit around doing CRM optimization^(like a poor idiot trying to avoid making his/her calls.)\n\n* I determined my KPI's (Key Performance Indicators) to be: # of calls made, # of people that answered, # of decision makers reached, # of requested call-backs or e-mails, # of appointments set, # of sales made. I made a mark next to the corresponding number on my list for each of these things occurring.\n\n* I recorded the meaningful points of the conversation (aka what to remember if I talked to them again), and the next step. If they said \u201cnot right now,\u201d I\u2019d write to call back in 6 months. I didn\u2019t call many of these people back.\n\n**The Goal of a cold call and any necessary follow-up activity is to get to a Yes or to a No.** \n\nDon\u2019t try to convince people of your product\u2019s value. That takes more effort and isn\u2019t what you should be doing. Explaining is required, but *convincing* is something altogether different \u2013 I didn\u2019t have the time or patience to try to show that there was value in a new website. If they didn\u2019t see it, then they didn\u2019t have any money or they were old-school and likely going to be tons of work to convince.\n\n* Small commitments lead to larger commitments. I didn\u2019t ask for the sale right away. I didn\u2019t ask for an hour of their time. I didn\u2019t ask for them to meet for coffee. I asked for 5 minutes of their time over the phone. If they liked what I had to say, then I\u2019d ask for 30 minutes of their time to show.\n* Don\u2019t leave voice mails for people unless they know who you are. Only leave voice mails for follow-up calls.\n\n* It is okay to call as often as 5 times per week (once per day), but only leave one voicemail per week in follow-up. It is safer to call only 2-3 times per week, and you should call less often as time goes on so you\u2019re not annoying. I\u2019d say up to 5 calls the first week, 3 calls in week 2, 2 calls in week 3, and 1 call per week after that for follow-up. Just a general set of guidelines.\n\n**The most important concept I learned on my own: The Three Boxes**\n\n*People have three boxes in their head that need to be \u201cchecked off\u201d before they will allow you to pass. The receptionist, the business owner, or the office manager will reject your call and not even give you an answer if you don\u2019t give them these three critical pieces of information!*\n\n1. \u2013 **Your name.** You don\u2019t need to give your company name. Sometimes it\u2019s even a bad thing if you give your company name. It doesn\u2019t add credibility \u2013 It just tells me that I don\u2019t know you. Most times, I\u2019d only give my first name, and this was almost *always* fine.\n\n2. \u2013 **How you found them.** This tells them if you have something in common or not. If you found them in the Chamber of Commerce, for example, this tells them that you\u2019re local and immediately differentiates you from a random cold call. Look to leverage anything you can to show that you are \u201clike them.\u201d If you can somehow connect on any level, you get a check on this box, because you seem human.\n\n3. \u2013 **Why you\u2019re calling (and it better not be to sell something!).** This one is really the crux of why I am different. If I told someone that I was looking to sell them a website, they\u2019d get rid of me as quickly as possible. \u201cUgh, not another sales call\u2026\u201d I needed to give them a different, but still valid, reason for calling. My reason was because I saw \u201ca potential fit between our businesses, and was calling to talk to [insert name here] about it.\u201d \n\n*I do tell them what I am selling afterward, but once I addressed the third box in this new way, something magic happened. People started listening! I was no longer selling snake oil to make money, but was offering to talk about something that would be mutually beneficial. Often times, they would identify with me, and I would get people to give me respect and honest answers. Many times, the answer was still no, but I got my answer! And guess what? Sometimes the answer was yes and I made a sale!*\n\n**The Script (Finally)**\n\n[Link to the script in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_L1LW4qqDE04DH4K8B_BWFNNf5AdvnWMRFLM-eib28/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[UPDATE: Link to the conversation script in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kOFBAmnPzAFFNo52845HzdrLR2-e6xO6XMFYhBlorJ4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHopefully by now, you have read this and can understand why my script is this way.\n\n**How I followed up**\n\nThere is a difference between *following up* and *moving prospects forward.* It\u2019s a lot simpler than you might think \u2013 Start your follow-up call with a goal in mind, remembering that small commitments lead to larger commitments. For me, I always had the same goals in my prospect funnel:\n\n1.\tCold call\n2.\tAsk for a 5 minute conversation (to determine if there is a fit)\n3.\tSchedule a 20-30 minute demo (even if it ends up being an hour\u2026 20-30 minutes is easier to stomach for a \u201cbusy\u201d business person)\n4.\tAsk for the sale after a website demonstration (Go over pricing \u2013 3 pricing packages are important. Don\u2019t do this for custom quotes\u2026 Custom quote requires a modified process from what I shared) \n5.\tMeet in person over coffee, buy their coffee, thank them for their business, get to know them and their company more, and ask for referrals.\n\n**The end result (Recap)**\n\nI went from being ~5 months from bankruptcy to making just over $120,000 by myself (using the same company I sold for as sub-contractors for the work, which their cut wasn\u2019t included in the 120k) in my 2nd year of doing this. I also supplemented this work with focused business networking after a while, which is a whole other 3,000-word post in and of itself.\n\n**A few final notes** \n\n* I made a commitment to making 50 calls per day, 5 days per week. I know others can supposedly bang out 100-300 calls a day, but I don\u2019t know how you do it with any brain power. My brain power was gone after about 50 calls. I would make 50 calls in 4 hours or less. That is a good benchmark, especially when starting out. I was also given that advice by other successful sales professionals. A note is that I counted every time I dialed, whether I spoke to a person or got a voicemail.\n\n* I bought a pack of small beads at Wal-Mart and put 50 of them into a cup. When I dialed a number, I would move 1 bead over. It was motivation once I was 30 calls in and didn\u2019t want to finish. I even wrote cheesy motivating blurbs on the cups like \u201cyou can do it\u201d and \u201ckeep going!\u201d Whatever gets you to keep picking up the phone.\n\n* Don\u2019t let yourself get distracted. You will stop making calls \u2013 I guarantee it!\n\n* Don\u2019t start doing this without an emergency fund (shoutout to [r/PersonalFinance](reddit.com/r/personalfinance) in place. I recommend keeping 6 months of expenses in an emergency fund account. I needed mine to make it happen.\n\n* You need to have the memory of a goldfish! You have to just forget or leave behind the negative experiences and focus on doing your best **now.** I did not get yelled at very often, which was due to the way I conducted calls (explained below), but it hurt a LOT when I did. Also, there were entire days that I failed on myself. A few times, I remember making less than 5 calls, putting on headphones and playing Elder Scrolls: Oblivion for 8 hours straight because I let a mean person get to me. Nothing against gaming, but this will kill your dreams \u2013 I was not okay with failing on my wife and potentially losing our home, but I failed that day. I would pick up and continue on the next day as if nothing happened \u2013 It\u2019s a new day, and a new chance to succeed! Don\u2019t get down on yourself for failures.\n\n**Feel free to post any questions you may have in the comment section. I will answer them as best I can. If you want me to do an AMA on building a marketing agency from scratch down the road, I can if the mods want me to do it.**\n",

And that's okay. The key is to understand which one you're looking at here and respond correctly. \n\nIf it's #1, ask if the person you're talking to can take the time to help line up a call or let you know who you can talk to. Basically, follow up the chain.\n\nIf it's #2, it's not personal and it's just a mismatch of needs/solutions. Thank them for their time and move on. (But also maybe spend some time figuring out your targeting approach)\n\nIf it's #3, you might or might not get a second shot at it, but at least you'll learn what kind of script / messaging is not working here. Thank them for their time and re-tune your messaging for the next call.\n\nIf it's #4, try to schedule a time to call back for a more thorough deep dive into your product, and give them any marketing materials you have in the interim. i.e. product sheets, etc. Avoiding this situation generally requires that you have a kick-ass 30 second elevator pitch, and a kick ass 10 minute offering pitch. That first one requires that you really understand what it is you're selling and fine tune your pitch. Then it's practice, practice, practice until you can recite that 30 second pitch like it's second nature without ever skipping a beat, or stumbling over a single word. For example, one of the startups I worked with was aspiring to be an e-commerce platform for agriculture products, and have a whole bunch of other bells and whistles attached to it. Talking about it would have taken 20 minutes by itself. but when I began helping them with the pitch, I narrowed it down to \"we're a big data platform that helps agricultural social impact investors get better bang for buck\". One line, 15 seconds if you speak slowly. With that line, the founder was able to go through 20x the number of people that he talks to at a networking event and quickly filter out people who aren't interested. If your elevator pitch is on point and you've struck a cord, you generally will get an invitation to talk more about this, with offers to schedule times. That's what you're gunning for here.\n\nIf it's #5 you can't do anything about it. But know that it's not about you. Their shitty attitude is not an indictment of your character, your worth, your abilities, or your business. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, you need to remember that.\n\nthe truth is that the hardest part is really the first 2 months. This is the make or break period for any new sales person because this is the time when you're the most vulnerable due to the lack of experience, comfort with talking about the product, and just lacking a rhythm. \n\nJust remember though, you're goal is NOT to make the sale right there on the spot. If you're not selling consumer products or anything that is impulse purchase-y, then your goal is just to get to a meeting, a follow up call, or just an offer to introduce you to the right person. That's it. Don't push for the sale right there unless you KNOW you got the right person, the right solution, and the right moment. (And if you can do that consistently, you're already an amazing salesman and don't need to listen people like me)\n\nJust keep things moving forward. Don't let the slow progress deter you. The bigger organization, the longer it can take. For my company now, one of our biggest customers took 3 months to close on a deal that is by all accounts a complete no brainer. The only reason it took so long was because we had to clear 4 different execs across 3 different departments and go through a bunch of documentation. \n\nJust keep the momentum going, and imagine yourself to be a wave that is that slowly wearing down a rock. Eventually, you WILL wash the damn rock away, but it will take time. As long as you keep that in mind, you'll be fine. ",

Make a living doing that for a few years, and you'll be the best salesman ever. I spent five years doing it abut 15 years ago, and the experience has paid off in every sales job I've had since. It's the NFL of sales.",

I ask most agents that want to work for me to go spend two weeks in timeshare. Westgate has training that is better than any sales seminar you can go to, and anyone who makes it through the two weeks becomes a much better sales person. It's a weird job, but you definitely learn how to sell. ",

I always worked for lower pressure places that put the emphasis on psychologically wearing down the customer's defenses. By the time you're  done, they can't think of a single reason NOT to buy. It's  an intense mind game from the handshake on, rather than just beating them over the head.\n\nAlso, the very best time share people still only sell 3 out of 10, so people that act like jerks get forgotten immediately. You just try to filter through your tours until you get one with potential and then just concentrate on hitting all your marks. \n\nIt's a burnout job, though. The best people at my resort made $300-400,000 a year, and were completely toasted. They would quit in a heartbeat if they could find something else that paid like that, but they couldn't.\n",

Only things that I feel are different would be #3 and a slight clarification for others reading on point #4.\n\n #3 for me -- With my process, I actually get through the gate keeper about 1/2 the time. I also get told to pound sand only once or twice in 10 calls. Most of the time that I talk to an owner, I get to a yes or a no, and I have been told extremely few times to not call again. I think it's related to my point about the \"fit between our businesses.\"\n\nRegarding #4, I like your point. I always have a goal for the call. On a cold call, for my product, I need to go for a commitment to a 5-minute conversation first. People appreciate that I won't be wasting their time if they aren't interested, so they almost always give me 5 minutes. That's why I never try to jump past that \"5 minute commitment\" into a sale or scheduled appointment.\n\nI love everything else. I think your point below is awesome, as I do it almost unconsciously:\n\n&gt; Stand up and walk around while you make your calls. You'll be more energetic and it will also carry over in your voice.",

Check the source.\n\n1. Best thing you can do when cold calling is having a simple goal in mind and remain focused on the goal. Sure the end goal might be to land a sale but the goal for your first call might be schedule a follow-up call or book a meeting. Rarely are people trying to make a true sale over the phone and even if they are it's rarely on that first call. So don't get ahead of yourself and try to make a sale. Take it back a step and try to book that meeting (or whatever that could be).\n\n2. With that in mind respect their time and get to the point. In a quick and concise way you need to: introduce yourself, the purpose for your call, what is the benefit to them? Cut out 100% of the bullshit and just be honest and straight to the point.\n\n3. Know it's a numbers game. Even if you have a \"qualified list\" you're going to get a \"don't call me again\" 19 out of 20 times. Or a more polite \"sorry Mr. ____ is in a meeting\". But that 20th time you get somebody they will actually let you continue talking and will actually listen to what you have to say.\n\n4. Know when to go for the close. You need to learn what are qualified buying questions - if they start asking about the price or comparing products you know they are hooked. That's when you go for your mini-close (the meeting/the follow-up/maybe the sale). Don't out talk yourself. Once they are interested go for the close.\n\n5. Learn to turn a negative into a positive. If you make enough calls you'll hear every excuse in the book. Too busy, not the right time, don't have the money, not interested, actually just got one. Whatever that excuse is to get you off the phone us it to your advantage.\n - If they are busy - great! Because you love working with busy people. If they weren't busy they could just do it themselves and wouldn't need you.\n - They don't have the money - perfect! Because your product overtime can actually save them money by &lt;reducing time, minimizing costs, whatever that reason is&gt;.\n - Oh they already work with a &lt;your profession&gt; - awesome! They already know and understand the value of working with a &lt;your profession&gt; so it saves you the need to sell them on why they need you in the first place. Are they satisfied with their &lt;your profession&gt;? If so, tell them you would love to hear what their guy/gal does so well that makes them satisfied. If they truly are you're not going to get them as a customer anyway (which is fine) but now you're getting priceless feedback on what your target market appreciates in your competitors. If they aren't satisfied well... there ya go.\n\n6. Stand up and walk around while you make your calls. You'll be more energetic and it will also carry over in your voice.\n\nGreat post again!

Short and sweet - \"Are you the right person to speak with about this? If not, could you please refer me to them?\"\n\nThen I'd book a call with them and qualify them. \"Do you use distance sensors? Oh yeah, what kind? How are you liking them?\"\n\nIf they were qualified, they'd go into my follow-up list where I'd periodically call and try to move the process along if they didn't close for a trial kit right on that call.\n\nThe cold email approach allowed me to increase the conversations I was having with people who were actually interested in new sensors, and were in charge of new technology at their company. \n\nThe cold calling was very expensive time wise, versus sending out 200 emails in the morning, getting 10 interested responses and working those down to a couple closes, with some warm leads going into the next month.",

If you look up \"hustle\" in the dictionary, it should have your name next to it.\n\nMy take away was how you managed to assign a monetary value to \"no's\" received.

            "comment": "Cold calling definitely works. This is a terrific plan for a sales person. The problem I'm seeing is... you're not just a sales person.\n\nI'm also a web developer/designer/Internet marketing consultant that worked solo for the last 3 years. I know that I could have made a lot more money last year than I did had I aggressively cold-called local businesses, but I did everything myself and just wasn't able to balance marketing/lead generation AND project management AND implementation. Learned some very hard lessons about delegation and outsourcing fast and early. I'm currently on sabbatical because I'm so burnt out - I've taken a 6-month content manager contractor to give myself an entrepreneurial break, but I do believe that if I ever go back to it, I'll go the cold calling route. \n\nI do have a few questions for you if you don't mind.\n\n**Pricing**\n\nYou say you made $120K gross last year, or $10K per month. You also say that you \"made a sale\" 2.5 times out of 100, and that you made approximately 250 calls per week. That averages out to 6.25 sales per week or 25 new clients per month, which means that, per NEW client, you made only $400. \n\nThat's not even taking into account any recurring revenue from those clients, which you didn't mention (unless I missed something) which would drive your per-client fees down even further.\n\nIn 2015, I charged on average $1400 per project, and those are very straightforward custom WordPress sites, and that is slightly below industry average. IOW, unless you're selling ready-made template solutions that you can knock out very fast or small consulting packages, you are aggressively competing on price at a level most US developers cannot afford to, correct?\n\nFor transparency's sake, I charges an average of $700 per project in 2014 and had about 58 clients. Hence, I actually made *less* money in total in 2014 than I did in 2014 despite actually having far fewer new clients in 2015. \n\n**Implementation**\n\nIf you're spending 20 hours per week making cold calls and working the usual freelancer 50-60 hours per week, that's leaving you an hour and change per week for each month's new clients - not accounting for customer service, tech support requests, random inquiries, and all those hours spent \"meeting for coffee\" (which I have only done twice in the last two years because IMO they're a huge waste of time - but maybe I'm wrong!). \n\nSo I'm assuming that you have at least a couple of subcontractors that do the implementation side of your business and you act more as a lead generator/project manager/ customer service manager, no?\n\nI've priced out a full time developer from the Philippines, which you'd need at least three of for the 300+ clients you had by the end of last December, and even the cheap inexperienced ones (which have their pros and cons) cost $1400-1800/month. So if you have even just two of these, you only really grossed about $6400 net per month - working 60 hours a week, you made about $26.50/hour. Maybe you worked less than that - maybe you got lucky and snagged much cheaper subcontractors than I was able to find in the 15 months I looked, maybe you were just as brilliant about your support flow as you are about your sales flow and set up canned responses to customer service inquiries/ post-launch support/ etc. \n\nThat is still more money than I made last year, so I'm very impressed that you've gone against conventional wisdom in the freelance consulting field: you compete on price and volume, like Amazon does with books and products. All conventional sales tactics for freelancers tell you to compete on value and experience and not lowball price yourself out. \n\nI.e., Conventional wisdom says five $2000-clients are worth more than twenty $500-clients. But you've done the opposite of that, and in an industry where $2000 clients are harder and harder to come by for small operations like you and me, I think you're really onto something here if you're able to keep on scaling at that rate.

Now, we are a fully staffed agency and do all of our work in-house. Sorry I didn't make that more clear in the post!\n\nI actually only made 150-200 calls per week in practice. My goal was 250. And once I got busy, some weeks I had to stop making calls and do the work, lol. I'd say the average ticket for me was about $1,200 at the time. I also did not make any recurring revenue from other services (until later, when I added them as a service).\n\nI also sub-contracted a lot of work out, and so I wasn't often involved in the actual production of the sites. I did content and communicated with the design team.\n\nIt is a very good process, and the company I was selling for did a good job for me. I actually made top retailer of the year and top website salesman of the year for 2 years running in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe problem with scaling is that you have to duplicate yourself, which is hard. Nobody is going to care as much about your own business as you. I've tried and had some success in duplication, but I didn't have enough to get a decent base + commission structure going to test it out at the time. ",

So the $120K was your cut of an average $1200-per-new-client sale? \n\nI agree that no one is going to care about your business as much as you are. If you hire someone to do your marketing for you - say, if I were to hire someone to set appointments for me using your system - then you have to accept that that person's average sale per call is going to be much lower than 6 new clients per week. Even a very good sales person would generate maybe 1 new client per week.\n\nTherein lay my problem as a solo web developer: I couldn't afford to pay someone to do even part-time sales every week when I knew they would at most only be generating one or so clients a week at $1200-2000 per project giving them 30% of a cut like I'm guesstimating from your numbers that you got from each client. I'm hearing that from so many web developers. To make it sustainable on both the implementation end and the marketing end, you basically have to have the capital to hire a great team already hired to do one or the other before you ever even open for business regardless of your cashflow. If not,  either marketing or implementation will suffer, because no one person can do it all. ",

Even I couldn't keep it up forever. I had to have hope that there was an end to the madness at some point.\n\nI find that the thing to build a business on is consistent monthly marketing/web hosting/programming work. We may bring in $20,000 of web sales in a given month, but I won't count on *any* of these sorts of sales for budgeting or staffing reasons. The consistent money coming in that you can rely on (to a point, as clients can always cancel for whatever reason) is what you should base staffing decisions on. If you don't have any coming in, don't hire. If you have tons of extra work and need help, subcontract out, because the pipeline won't always be so full. Know what I mean?\n\nThe only other alternative to put systems like this into place with staff is to seek investors! But that's risky too -- I'd only accept investors that are going to put time and effort into the business themselves.",

I would get more content about how changing the website can increase their conversions, showing my current porfolio, talk about all success cases i had, and how my work can make the company look more professional, and this will bring more sales like this other a,b,c case studies i can show you on a meeting. And i even have an 100% guarantee that if you dont like my work, you get your money back.\n\nThe money back guarantee i believe is an key part of Trust when you are on phone, because is an strong statement used by people that Trust their product.\n\nOther fact that was important for me is that, usually it takes me 2-5 calls to talk with Owner. But not because they dont want to, because they just are not avaliable at that time.\n\nCongrats on your success, but i think your script is too simple on my experience. I dont cold call anymore it is cheap but Door to Door sales has an higher conversion rate. Door to Door i can get one meeting every 4-6 companys.\n",

I'm going to give it a shot in my area. \n\nI was literally on the brink of giving up since I have not been able to get any business going. With a wedding coming up in April, the pressure is on and I could definitely feel it. A few tears last night and a feeling of being lost, but then this is the top post today. I hope I can have a fraction of the success you have had. ",

The rejection of those no's was tough, but I would never have gotten any of the yes'es if I wasn't willing to wade through the no's.",

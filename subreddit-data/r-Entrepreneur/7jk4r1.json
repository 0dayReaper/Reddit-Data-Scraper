    "postText": "Everyone thinks that in order to become an entrepreneur, you need to have a totally unique idea, also known as a \"blue ocean\" idea. I think that's totally false and in fact the worst advice you can follow. I originally wrote the the below for Forbes, but I thought it would be helpful to share it here. Hope it's helpful, happy to answer any questions. \n\nThis may not be what  you want to hear, but unless you're Elon Musk, it's incredibly hard to bring a totally innovative product to market.\n\nThe irony is I learned this lesson after winning a best new product of the year award for a completely innovative product a few years ago.\n\nYou may have heard of the idea of a blue ocean versus a red ocean when it comes to product development. They're pretty simple concepts: A red ocean is the idea that there is a ton of competition in the area you\u2019re trying to compete in, whereas a blue ocean is the concept that you\u2019re in an area where you\u2019ve got the whole ocean to yourself.\n\nA lot of companies think they should try and shy away from red oceans and stick to blue waters. The problem is that if you are in a blue ocean with a totally unique idea it can be incredibly hard to make people aware of what your product does, and that people actually need it.\n\nI\u2019ll give you a very specific example, with our biggest product, Halo Oral Antiseptic. When we launched in 2012, we brought an incredible innovation in germ control to market. We got patents issued, were showered with praise by the industry, and were convinced (and so was every single retailer in America) that we would be an overnight hundred million dollar plus brand.\n\nWell what we found out was that it is incredibly expensive to explain exactly what Halo is, and why people should use it. We literally spent millions on television, print ads and coupons, as well as an enormous public relations campaign. It was brutal. Now, we did eventually make people aware of the brand, but it was an expensive path to go down.\n\nI learned that innovation is just not enough for the average company or entrepreneur to make a product a winner. You have to be able to get people to not only know about the product, but believe in it AND BUY IT. That's tougher and more expensive to do than you think!\n\nThe Best New Products Award We Won as Voted On by 100 of America's Top Retailers\n\nThat's why I now solely implement what I call Pink Ocean Strategy. Put simply, I go into product categories that are proven, but I bring a unique angle to the market. So you're probably asking, \"Ok Afif, so what makes for a product in a Pink Ocean?\" \n\nA Pink Ocean Strategy involves going into a proven product category with a product that uses unique features, benefits or packaging to stand out.\n\nSo let's look at a couple examples of companies having great success taking a Pink Ocean approach.\n\nThe first is one that I assume you've heard of many times. A little product by the name of the Dyson Vacuum. The story of how James Dyson came up with the cyclone mechanical action of his famous (and very expensive) vacuum is the stuff of entrepreneurial lore. He spent years making thousands of different prototypes before he got it just right.\n\nBut guess what? When he introduced his product, he didn't have to prove to anyone that they needed a vacuum. They already knew about vacuums! He just created a more powerful vacuum with a unique cyclone action, and became a billionaire in the process. Now that is Pink Ocean thinking!\n\nNow let's go from one of the highest profile brands, to a general product category that's about as boring as it gets. I'm talking about lip balms, arguably one of the most commoditized product categories in all of retail. I think we can all agree the world doesn't need another lip balm! Or does it? Because there are probably a dozen enormous lip balm brands that all have some unique angle.\n\nEOS comes in unique egg shaped containers that are vibrantly colored, Burt\u2019s Bees goes with the folksy au naturale vibe (Ironically now owned by Clorox) and Lip Smackers come in a thousand flavors. You get the picture. Each of these lip balm brands has been able to take an utterly generic product and simply add a unique spin, creating enormously successful brands in the process.\n\nIronically, even the great Elon Musk did not invent the electric car, or obviously the car. He took the lame idea of a fuddy-duddy electric car, that had been floating around for years, and came out with a beautiful sports car, creating a company worth tens of billions, and turning the car industry upside down in the process.\n\nSo the grand take away? Forget about red and blue oceans and sail towards Pink Oceans by looking for products that are proven sellers, and find a unique angle for your product.",

Their brand was established long before they released the product.\n\nElon Musk isn't famous just for electric cars, he was a founder of what would become PayPal, as well as ZipCar. He  had a following and brand recognition before he would get into electrical cars.\n\n\nDyson is interesting, he failed hard on his invention. It took many many years before he would achieve success in the US market. He actually was declined from many retailers because they say his vacuum as inferior since it wouldn't bring in ongoing sales from vacuum bags. ",

We make good money on minimizing waste. We have the lowest failure rates in the market and can pump them out very cheaply with US labor because of our systems leading to little loss on material, parts or labor. Less than 2% of any product started leads to a loss. We literally look at what other companies sell a lot of and do it better from sourcing, assembly and quality control at every step to eliminate downstream failures and losses beyond each step. Most companies just pump out numbers and lots of scrap, with what makes it to market being inferior in lifespan. We also design our products better to cover more markets with backwards compatibility, having fewer products that can fill multiple roles, and being designed for future changes still compatible with past as well as new applications. Literally find something people buy and learn how to improve the product, or improve at making it. Where many companies fail is how they make and sell a good idea. They don\u2019t tighten cost controls moving forward and suffer huge opportunity costs as they grow leaving them less resources to compete in the future when others move in. We\u2019ve moved in on all the Asian competitors hard and one of them has switched to just making some parts for us instead. They were however making knock offs of American and European companies that are good at what they do. Our strength against them is that we don\u2019t mess with niche or custom stuff. We only make stuff that sells and get a huge return on our research and inventory. ",

Are you referring to canker sores? Those are the only minor oral irritation I can think of. How often do these get infected? According to Wikipedia it's a benign condition so my guess is almost never.\n\nThe image on the package doesn't help either. It 'protects against airborne germs', so against the flu? Is a virus even a germ? I'm thinking this is probably what you are aiming at, so why doesn't the package say 'lowers flu infections by 85% according to research\"?",

A blue ocean means that you're creating a new market, which is the ideal scenario with any business. Your example of Elon Musk and Tesla proves this. He created demand for electric cars and there is a market. He did this by making huge changes to electric cars, making them sexy, cheaper, and more usable (longer range). Apple also did this by creating a smartphone industry. They entered the market by creating a cell phone that also combined your mail, internet, and music into your phone. Other companies may have tried that, but it wasn't usable and there was very little demand\n\nIf you're starting a new company and try to compete in this so called \"Pink Ocean,\" you're going to be competing, which is not what you want as a new company. You can't afford that if you want to scale and you can't provide anything that larger companies can't beat you at. You have to do what Airbnb, Apple, Tesla, and many other large newer companies did and create a market. \n\nEdit: Spelling",

In the US - it's easier to get people to try a new spin on pizza, than it is to convince them to try artisanal and organic kimchee. So yeah you'll own the organic kimchee market, but you've got to explain to a LOT of people, what is kimchee, get them to overcome their hesitancy to try it, and then convince them your version is better because it's non-GMO, vegan etc. With the pizza, most people would try a new spin on it, because they already know they love pizza. \n\nAlso with Apple, they didn't create a new market. They sold a new version of a phone with way more features. \n\nLastly, with AirBnB, Apple, Tesla, Uber, you name it. They literally raised billions of dollars to grow and many of them (obviously not Apple) are still losing a ton of money. Point being it's not practical for most people to pursue that path. ",

And I don't agree that a non-existent market = \"blue ocean.\" But the rewards are greater in the end. \n\nGoing with your example, people might enjoy your new spin on pizza but then every pizza place copies you. And now you have no advantage, lots of bills, and customers are giving money to the people who can beat you. I've seen this happen with so many local pizza (and other food) places that only last a year then are replaced by new owners trying the same thing. If you want to have fun, sure do this. Less risk and easier for a few months. This isn't how to create a business though.\n\nIn my mind, every market Apple has entered has been a new one. If you asked people whether they wanted to do a billion things on their phone they would have said no. They rejected blackberry and competitor smartphones. But Apple was able to create that demand. Same with iPod and iPad. You could argue that the car was just an iteration on a wagon. Just adding an engine vs a horse. However, it's still creating a new industry. Everyone needs a car now. Everyone needs a smartphone.\n\nIf I'm understanding this logic now it would be that it's better to enter the smartphone market with a new twist now vs 15 years ago and I would not encourage anyone to pursue that. Please help me to understand where I'm misunderstanding if this is not the logic you're proposing.\n\nAlso, the reason those companies have raised so much money is because they're actually producing value in new markets. They're losing money because of either execution problems or because they haven't reached their peak value that investors expect.",

Look at how poorly his initial Japanese version did.\n\nBut the domestic vacuum cleaner market became a race to the bottom. You couldn't differentiate between models so bought the cheapest. Companies cut cost and the quality worsened.\n\nThen when the Dyson was released it was so superior (although I'm not a fan and have plenty of issues with dysons) that the public were willing to pay the cost.  Competitors improved their own products and prices rose across the market.\n\nEven now, someone could easily come up with a better product but no necessarily at a competitive price.\n\nI think with your Pink Ocean analogy, the most successful solutions are those that correctly identify a market that is about to pivot and in which direction.

The results? I could never convince my customers to get on board (lack of massive marketing funds).\n\nAlways thought I was missing something. This post is it. I recently altered a big selling Christmas item and we've sold over 600 in a few weeks. As if I needed more affirmation, I added the same principle to another (boring, everyday) product... and sold four to our first buyer.\n\nI am going to get my act together tomorrow, and go over my failed ideas. I know they were potentially great in principle, so I'll apply Pink Ocean Stratagem and see where we go.\n\nThank you, Afif, sincerely, for this post. It just made our family business something incredible going into 2018.",

That's why startup investors say they invest in the team first: they know the idea, especially if it's novel, will most probably fail but you can always go back to the pink or red ocean (that's what pivoting is). If you sail too far into the blue, you'll get to the black ocean, and trust me, you don't want to go there. ",

I'm going to say that if you had spent all that advertising money on undervalued channels (sayyy ... like FB ads in 2012), you would have seen a drastically different result. \n\n2. I don't think this is very useful at all for most people. It's VERY rare to come up with something COMPLETELY new. You're always going to be able to say, \"yeah, but that's just X mixed with Y\". Imo, Tesla is about as innovative as it gets as a company, but you can always say, \"he didn't invent the car\". He also didn't invent the rocket ship either, but he's fucking taking us to Mars .... (he didn't invent that idea either, I guess). \n\n3. The pink ocean stuff you're talking about seems to walk a fine line between just straight arbitrage and slight improvement on an existing product. For me, I find a lot more fulfillment in creating something unique, and not just another \"lip balm\" with a new package. Now granted, people need to eat, so arbitrage, or something that makes you money, is always needed. But money shouldn't be the end game of entrepreneurship. I believe in creating a certain baseline of income to keep you afloat long enough so that you can take enough shots at building something truly meaningful to you. And again, making a slight change to an existing product/idea just for the sake of positioning yourself differently isn't all that interesting to me. That feels a lot like slapping your label on a generic product from AliExpress and calling it a business. \n",

You have to remember, back then, I'm not even sure FB ads were a thing, and even if they were, it was so incredibly early on that you couldn't do much targeting wise etc. It was just way to early in the digital marketing game to be pot-committed to digital advertising. \n\nI think you're missing my point on your second point. You're right, it's really REALLY hard to come up with something innovative. But I think a lot of people think that they have to in order to have a shot at being an entrepreneur. I agree with what you say about Tesla, he didn't even found Tesla. \n\nOn your last point, again you are right. I've just found that for the average entrepreneur, it's really hard to launch something truly innovative. I'm not saying that it's more fulfilling, just that if you want to get out there, this is an approach to consider. \nBut even then, it can be really satisfying to sell similar products that are out there depending on your approach. Look at Tom's, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Patagonia etc. Those guys ALL sell products that are honestly generic. But they've built really inspirational and meaningful companies around their social missions. Plus...it's been good for their business. \n\n",

Yeah Tom's didn't invent soap, they differentiated well, but it's really fucking hard to start a soap company now and differentiate, ESPECIALLY if you have no interest in soap, but you just took a course telling you the soap game is ripe for disruption.

Searches bring up all the mainstream stuff (Shark Tank, Apprentice, The Profit etc) and endless shows on financial markets. But nothing on day-to-day entrepreneurial life.\n\nShows that show how others have hit the same sort of challenges and how they overcome them. i.e. they share practical information and insights",

And it is a sentiment I totally agree with.\n\nHowever, I'm not looking for guru-type content that tells me how to do X, Y and Z (I want to avoid these). I'm more interested in how real business owners faced their challenges e.g. how a restaurant owner coped with the covid lockdowns, or how a partner coped with a crooked partner. More along the lines of interviews or documentaries rather than \"how to\" type content.",

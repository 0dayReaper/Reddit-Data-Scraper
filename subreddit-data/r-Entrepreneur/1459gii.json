            "comment": "Ahrefs + Google Ads.\n\nDrill down in your niche and find what are called \"low KD\" keywords, ideally with a volume above 500 and then setup individual ad sets to target each of those keywords.\n\nExample: T-shirts- Band T-Shirts- AC/DC T-Shirts\n\nYou want to make sure you have a conversion event enabled, so if you're running etsy/shopify or even just have a thank you page after purchase, make sure you have Google conversion pixel on your site.\n\nThen activate the pixel and trigger the event so Google knows the conversion event is active which allows you to start creating event-based campaigns, so your traffic costs (and overall effectiveness) are tied towards conversions instead of traffic.\n\nWhat this means is that Google will have another metric (your conversion) to tie your ad costs to and you can start bidding more effectively.\n\nFor example. If you're selling t-shirts and your margin is $12, you wouldn't want to assign more than $12 to a conversion event (a sale), even though AOV can come into play, let's just use $12.\n\nNow, with the $12 CPA event you can \"tell\" Google that you're willing to bid up to $12 for a conversion. Not a click. Not an impression, but an actual sale.\n\nIt's not guaranteed, of course, but since Google has seen conversions and has hopefully gathered enough data from your campaigns to know they can still make money giving you traffic for $6, or $8 per conversion - they will, assuming you convert at that ratio.\n\nThis is how you eventually scale, and it might be slightly over your head, but the point isn't to copy what I just said right away, but instead work towards getting that framework setup.\n\nYou can do this for Facebook/IG as well.\n\nStart with some keywords you know are relevant and less competitive, let Google auto-bid to get traffic (keep your daily budget at like $5 - $10 so it doesn't overspend) and as long as you have a pixel setup you can start gathering conversion events. Once those conversion events are active, THEN use the advice above and start event-based campaign bidding.\n\nGood luck!",

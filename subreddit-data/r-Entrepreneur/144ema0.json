    "postText": "This year I set out to answer something I have always questioned\u2026 \u201cwhat if\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if\u201d is both a dangerous and powerful set of words. Most people if not every person has the first single thought\u2026\n\nWhat if I tried this thing I have never done\u2026\n\nThen in one swift effortless motion our next thought without hesitation is\u2026.\n\nWhat if I just fail like I always do\u2026\n\nWe have now just created the pendulum of our future. Swinging back and fourth from what could be to what \u201cshould\u201d be. That\u2019s the dangerous part\u2026 like most we are either at the brink of pushing our boundaries! or forever staying bound by our roots\u2026\n\nFailure is by far the best teacher\u2026 so choosing NOT to start something because of self doubt is simply stripping from ourselves the opportunity to learn an invaluable lesson from failure or the chance to change our entire outlook from success. \n\nSo what if\u2026\nWhat if your past didn\u2019t dictate your future.\nWhat if failure sat on the same plate as success.\nWhat if you were only one mistake away from victory. \n\nWhat if\u2026\n\nI say Ignore the doubt and embrace your failures\u2026\nit might just change your view.\n\nBesides\u2026 what happens if you don\u2019t \ud83d\udc40\n\n*celebrating doing $40,000 USD from April - May in my e-commerce store*",

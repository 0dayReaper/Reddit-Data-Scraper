However, the people I\u2019d love to meet are fellow entrepreneurs, maybe have a talk and learn something new.\n\nAny recommendations on how to meet this kind of people? I\u2019m in Madrid, Spain if that helps.",

It is a great place to meet other entrepreneurs! \n\n  \nAlso, you can try joining an accelerator. I think google has one, but also you can try Lanzadera in Valencia. I started my company in an acelerator and I met a lot of founders. \n\nAlso, those accelerator often have Demo days, where they invite investors to see startups pitches. They usually have networking events after that. I'm also super shy in these events, so a trick I use is to contact a few people going to the event in advance (usually via twitter), to tell them I'll be there and that it would be great to grab a coffee. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, getting to have 2-3 founders to chat at least once per month has been key for me. It is hard to find people facing the same challenges.",

    "postText": "I am planning to start an outsourcing business but would like to find a mentor who can really give me direction. I have done the job that I am hoping to start an outsourcing business for, but I have never dealt with the business side (I.e. legal, contracts, sales etc) which I think I need guidance on. I know I have a lot to learn and would like to find someone to take me under their wing as it were. Is my best bet to find people who are leading/have led businesses in the industry and contact them through LinkedIn? Thanks!",

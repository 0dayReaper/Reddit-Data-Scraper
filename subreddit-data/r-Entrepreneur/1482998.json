Postmarked letters have worked in the past, but its not foolproof.   \n\n\nSecond, Get a business plan together. As trivial as they sound, the key elements you'll need are market fit, customer personas, and pricing strategies. Be certain to build out an MRR plan, and not just a flat fee basis. Recurring revenue allows you to forecast and plan, even if you take less money upfront.  \n\n\nThen, network aggressively on your own. Security is a REALLY large industry, and there are tons of ways to do this. If you \"can't find those networks\" you didn't try.   \n\n\nThen, tradeshows. Save or seek investment for as many security tradeshows as you can. These tradeshows, when done right, can generate hundreds of leads over the course of 2-3 days. Pace yourself. Ninja (walking a show floor without a booth, with the intention of learning and handing a few business cards out) at a few shows for hundreds, not thousands, and start there.  \n\n\nThen, license. You own the rights by this point, target businesses that need your technology, and hire a small B2B sales team. This is where REAL revenue can come into play at a relatively low cost.  \n\n\nExperience: Marketing of Physical Security Goods (Door handles and crap like that)",

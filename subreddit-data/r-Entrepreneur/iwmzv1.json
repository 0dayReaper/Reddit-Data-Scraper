    "postText": "I have two info products on the market:\n\n* [The Good Parts of AWS](https://gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts) \u2014 A 173 page PDF, released on Dec 25, 2019 (with pre-orders since Oct 3, 2019).\n* [Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience](https://gumroad.com/l/twitter-audience) \u2014 A 100 minute video, released on Apr 22, 2020 (with no pre-orders).\n\nThese two products made $237,207 in sales so far, and $210,822 in profit, for an average profit of $24,802/month. The AWS product took about 160 hours to produce, while the Twitter product only took 16 hours. But in this business, creating the content is generally the easy part. Finding customers is the bigger challenge. I've seen many creators succeed with various approaches, but I'm only familiar with one. And it goes like this: You find something you know really well, and you give everything you know about it for free. You do it on social networks, forums, and wherever people interested in your topic hang around. If you manage to get some attention, you will inevitably start getting questions, and these questions become your market research. You start answering the best way you can, and whatever doesn't fit in a short response becomes an opportunity for an info product. Then, if you choose to do the product, you'll have an audience to promote it to \u2014 an audience who already told you it wants to learn more about the topic, and that it wants to learn from you specifically.\n\nBut how big should your audience be for this to be viable? I don't know unfortunately. The fate of your products will depend on many things, but if you have an audience that's asking you questions, I'd say the odds are in your favor.\n\nSo, let's dig into what happened since I put my first info product on the market. First, let's take a look at my audience size:\n\nChart: [Audience](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/audience.png)\n\nI had a bit over 12,000 Twitter followers when my first product went on the market. Directly or indirectly, every dollar I made in this business can be attributed to this initial audience. I could have created the same two products before I had an audience, and I'm almost certain I wouldn't have sold any. The initial success brought with it all the future success through testimonials and word of mouth.\n\nSo, let's take a look at how the business grew since that launch:\n\nChart: [Income - All Products](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/income-all.png)\n\nThere seems to be a correlation between my audience size and revenue, but this relationship is more complex than it seems. New followers seem to bring new sales, but new sales also seem to bring new followers. I don't try to read too much into this relationship, but I can confidently say that having attention is good for this business. And it's not the follower count that matters most \u2014 it's how many people know about you, and want your perspective. This is not easy to measure, but you'll know when it happens (you keep getting lots of questions).\n\nSo, let's jump into the performance of each product to see if we can learn something useful about how they were marketed. First, the AWS product:\n\nChart: [Income - The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/income-aws.png)\n\nWe can see how there was an initial boost from the launch that lasted for about a month, and then sales stabilized at a steady rate. Then, there was another boost mid-March, partly because of a reduction in price, and partly from a new ad campaign (more on these later). That momentum has slowed down since, but it's still chugging along at a reasonable rate.\n\nNow, let's look at the Twitter product:\n\nChart: [Income - Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/income-twitter.png)\n\nThis launch was very similar to the other product (about $40K in two weeks), despite having an audience twice as large (24K vs 12K followers). However, the Twitter product took off much better after the third week, and it settled at a much stronger steady rate.\n\nHere's how both products compare on top of each other:\n\nChart: [Profit - Days on Market](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/days-on-market.png)\n\nI had expected the Twitter product to have a bigger initial spike considering my larger audience at launch. Instead, the launch was almost identical, but its momentum has been significantly stronger compared to my first product.\n\nI have some thoughts about what contributed to this dynamic. First, the Twitter product was sold at almost twice the price of the AWS product. Second, in hindsight, I think I set the launch price a bit too high for the Twitter product, which likely dampened the launch spike. In fact, after 3 weeks I reduced the base price by $10, and that appears to have untapped a large pool of demand that was likely reluctant to purchase at the original price.\n\nTake a look at how the average sale price changed over time (below), and how it affected the sales volume (above):\n\nChart: [Avg Sale Price - Days on Market](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/avg-sale-price.png)\n\nFor now, ignore those two big drops (we'll analyze that experiment later on). This chart shows my attempts at tweaking prices over time to try to find new demand. With the AWS product I started low and went high, then went low again. With the Twitter product I started high and kept going lower. My general takeaway from all this experimentation is that optimal pricing for consumer products is almost all about psychology, and what seems rational might not be very effective. Let me explain.\n\nIn theory, the best way to maximize profits from a digital product is to start with a high price and lower it over time. This is very common with movies. Disney just released Mulan last week for $30. After a few months, it will likely be on Amazon Video for $15, then a few months later you'll be able to rent it for $5, and then a year or two later you'll likely find it for free on Netflix. I tried to follow a similar approach with my second product, but I misjudged the psychological aspect. Basically, it's tough to get $100 from your most loyal fans, and then go promote the same product at $50 a few weeks later. If I were to start all over again, I would price the Twitter product between $35 and $45, and I suspect it would have done much better in that range. But even with this knowledge, now I'm reluctant to drop the price drastically because I'd have to promote the price change to the same audience that includes thousands of my most supportive customers who paid the original price, and I think that could be a short-term gain, long-term loss. (PS. [Steve Jobs faced this exact problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20070908223628/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/) when he dropped the price of the original iPhone after just 2 months.)\n\nWith my first product, I went the other direction. I took pre-orders at $24, then launched it at $28, and then increased it to $38 after a month. However, the $38 price appeared to meet some resistance, and the product lost some momentum. Then, the COVID pandemic hit in mid-March and I took that as an opportunity (and an excuse) to [reduce the price to $15](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1238666383442849792). This resulted in a significant second boost, which helped generate momentum from new word of mouth that has carried on until now.\n\nI have no specific advice on pricing, and I only have experience with consumer products. (Info products sold to businesses can likely command different prices.) However, after 261 days in this business, my inclination is to err on a lower price at launch, and make it up in volume. Selling more units at a lower price has highly beneficial side-effects, including being easier to do, better reviews, better customer satisfaction, fewer refunds, and most importantly the multiplicative effects of increased worth of mouth. In this business, selling 100 products for $1 each is a lot better than selling one product for $100, because in the first case you'll potentially get 100 people promoting your product for free.\n\nThe chart below shows what I think is the opportunity I missed with my Twitter product:\n\nChart: [Units Sold - Days on Market](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/units-sold.png)\n\nNote how the AWS product sold significantly more units throughout its lifetime (excluding the recent spike), despite my audience being about half the size. Also, based on the engagement I get, I'm convinced that my audience is more interested in Twitter than AWS. My conclusion is that the Twitter product could have sold significantly more units than my first product if I priced it lower, and it would have likely made more profit through larger volumes and increased word of mouth.\n\nOkay, now let's look at that extreme spike from last month. This was the result of [a tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1296215801020604416) where I announced a 1 hour promotion where anyone could get my products for any price they wanted, with a $1 minimum. The tweet was seen over 150,000 times, and it generated almost $8,000 in revenue from 2,559 sales. This is obviously not something I can do again any time soon, but it seems like it worked as a one-off promotion. My concern was that this would eat revenue from customers that would have likely bought at full price in the future (and I'm sure there was a bit of that), but the benefits from getting the product in the hands of thousands of new people appears to have countered that downside. Both products continue to sell at their regular rate since that promotion ended.\n\nAlso, note how the Twitter product sold twice as many units as the AWS product through this promotion, despite both getting equal treatment from me. I think this is more evidence that there's significantly more interest in the Twitter topic within my organic reach.\n\nNext, we're going to look at another marketing experiment I tried with the AWS product:\n\nChart: [Profit from Ads - The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/ad-profit.png)\n\nI started experimenting with paid ads back in January, but I gave up very quickly. First, I couldn't find a reasonable cost-per-click rate amongst the popular advertising platforms, except for Reddit. On Reddit, I was able to show an ad in the r/aws sub for about $0.50/click. It started quite promising, but after a few days it was barely breaking even so I decided to stop. Then when the COVID pandemic hit, I heard that advertising rates were plummeting so I decided to give it another go. This time I was able to show my ads for just $0.10/click and the initial results were excellent. I kept tweaking things to try to find more availability at higher CPC bids, but eventually the rates became competitive again around mid-June and I was struggling to break even. If I had more time to invest in paid ads, there's likely more opportunity there, but for now I chose to invest my time elsewhere and I stopped the campaign.\n\nThe following is the chart I was watching on a daily basis to assess my ad performance:\n\nChart: [Daily Profit from Ads - The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/daily-ads.png)\n\nFinally, I want to show you some of my top performing sources of direct sales.\n\n* $20,015 \u2014 [The announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1252963753647316992) for my Twitter product.\n* $16,659 \u2014 [The announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1209686739146534912) for my AWS product.\n* $13,734 \u2014 [The Reddit ad](https://www.reddit.com/user/dvassallo/comments/g7ivsz/the_good_parts_of_aws_written_by_two_exaws/) for my AWS product.\n* $13,438 \u2014 [This tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1260021329769594880) where I first discounted the base price of my Twitter product by $10.\n* $12,303 \u2014 The Gumroad link in [my Twitter bio](https://twitter.com/dvassallo).\n* $9,326 \u2014 [My personal website](https://danielvassallo.com), which gets almost all its traffic from my Twitter bio.\n* $8,849 \u2014 [Another tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1263160316277350400) mentioning the $10 price discount.\n* $7,868 \u2014 [The pay what you want tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1296215801020604416).\n* $6,615 \u2014 [Another tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1277111764132347904) mentioning the Twitter product.\n* $6,367 \u2014 The email announcing the release of my Twitter product to 880 people on the list.\n* $5,159 \u2014 [A post on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21888049) where I shared some stats from my AWS product launch.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you found this useful.

At least the twitter thing, it looks to me exactly like that. He didn't replicate this, it's probably just a list of things he did to increase his follower count (for what we know, he might've just payed for those subscribers so he can show \"proof\" that his methods work, we can't know). And the things he did probably work only in his nice and his exact scenario (being an ex-AWS engineer gives him some credibility in the tech niche) but he doesn't disclose that. He sells them as generic advice and making money out of that, a lot of people who don't have his credentials or are not interested in building the audience in the tech niche are still buying his course because they are being mislead. I bet it's just some generic advice such as \"post every day', \"ask questions\", \"do polls\", \"do give aways\", and things like that.\n\nAnd I've seen his ad on the AWS thing. A lot of people were calling him out because he basically put in that book some generic descriptions about each service AWS provides and no in-depth content you would normally expect, and once every few days, those comments were deleted by him.\n\nSo, to draw the conclusions? Yeah, I'd stay as far as possible from this guy's courses and just mark him as a generic get-rich-quick-sheme and bundle-generic-content-in-an-e-book seller.",

            "comment": "There is a lot of value in this post! I'd like to share some experiences that address a couple of the negative comments here:\n\n1. Why share your secrets if you are making that much money?\n\nThe most recent figures point spending across online learning at $483 million per day. This was back in 2016/2017. COVID numbers are likely significantly higher. My company sells online course creation software, and I can tell you there are thousands of creators earning numbers like these across almost any topic you can think of. There is more than enough to go around, even if OP was directly telling people to specifically make an info product about AWS or Twitter to compete with him.  \n\n2. Why take advice from someone who only had 10k followers at the time they started?\n\nThe OP isn't claiming to be the master of growing twitter followers. He isn't asking you to hire him as a consultant at five grand a month for a few calls. He is selling a $45 product with advice about how he got to where he is. There are many businesses earning 7 figures annually with significantly less than 10k followers on social media. \n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about selling knowledge online is that it isn't possible unless you are the absolute best. The truth is that you only need to be one step ahead of those you wish to teach. In fact someone who is only slightly ahead of those they wish to teach can often find themselves in a better position to provide value to their customers, because they have more recently went through the same problems that their customers are facing.\n\nIf you haven't read it, I highly recommend this article on 1000 true fans:\nhttps://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\n\n\n3. I could just search and learn this myself, why should I pay for it?\n\nYou could learn it yourself yes, and OP's product is priced accordingly (under $100) as a product helping you get that information slightly faster. There are three main levels of service that an online course would offer: \"Do it yourself\", \"Done with you\", and \"Done for you\". OP's product is a \"do it yourself\" product. These types of products are usually under $100. I encourage creators to build a \"done with you\" offering because this can provide much more value to their customers while still allowing the creator to leverage their time. An example of a \"done with you\" product would be an online course that includes some level of interaction with the creator, as well as potential interaction with other students who are able to help each other reach the result they are after. This kind of product is usually priced between $200 and $3000 depending on what it offers. \n\nTo use the growing Twitter following example, here is how we could describe the three potential service levels: \n\n1. Learn about how to grow your twitter following (Do it yourself - ebook or video) Price: $10-$100 \n2. Grow your twitter following to 10k in X days with us (Done with you - complete program with interaction between creator and students) Price: $200-$3000\n3. I will grow your twitter following for you (Done for you - consultant does the work for you) $1500/month+\n\nFinally, I'd like to encourage everyone here to be more open to the possibilities and potential that is out there! Personally I would consider the route of selling a sub-$100 product as your flagship product a more difficult route to take to reach the level of earnings that dvassallo did here. If he offered the option of purchasing a higher priced, in-depth \"done with you\" style program for those who wanted more, he could have probably significantly increased revenue over the same timeframe.",

So I thought that creating a 'serious business' type of brand might be better to give the information more credible. A good example of a company in the space is https://www.nngroup.com/ , just to give you an example. Admittedly this company uses the founder names in their brand, lol. \n\nI've been thinking more and more that maybe I should drop this less-personal, more-serious approach in favour of building my personal 'face and name' brand instead because Twitter is quite personal and it might be better for engagement, especially initially. \n\nWhat do you think?",

Also they don't fill time, they say what needs said and move on. \n\nThose that give average - good feeling value, typically have some more of the same behind their pay-wall. They will try to take time and attention and fill it with value mixed with filler. \n\nEssentially the cost of research historically is time and attention.  The only way around this it those you trust refering you.",

These days in a lot of entrepreneur groups you'll have 80-90% of the comments suggesting that's the way to start a business. However it's very rare you see someone who has actually managed to do it. I'm more old school, I think you should do market research to start, but also believe getting a captive audience of thousands before you built anything isn't feasible for the vast majority of people, even though a lot of those people could succeed in entrepreneurship.\n\nYour post is one of the few that's different, where you actually show how you acquired an audience and then sold them something.",

You literally just drag and drop your file, write a description, set the price, and you get a link. Then the money from your sales start going to your bank account every Friday.\n\nCompared to Amazon or other big platforms:\n\n* Gumroad cut 3.5% vs Amazon 65%.\n* Gumroad pays weekly, other tend to pay monthly.\n* Gumroad has built-in tools for coupons, affiliates, mailing list, analytics, etc.\n* I prefer supporting Gumroad than some faceless big company.\n* Most importantly, my customers remain mine. I have the email of all my customers, I can email them, offer them upgrades, and so on. If you sell through Amazon and other marketplaces, they will be their customers and you just get a royalty.\n\nThe main difference though is that Gumroad is just a host and payment processor. You have to find your customers. Other platforms help you in that aspect (that's why they tend to take a huge cut of your sales).\n\nPS. Last month [I started working for Gumroad](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1300853597337341952) on a quarter-time basis.

                    "comment": "It took a lot of time, but in hindsight I wasted a lot too. Likely spent about 3 hours a day on Twitter during the first year.\n\nWhat worked was sharing what I was doing to set up my business, sharing how I was exploring ideas, giving a glimpse into how things were going, etc. I formed a habit where at the end of each day I reflected on what happened during the day, and if there was something that I thought might be interesting to others I defaulted to sharing. Even sharing mundane things such as how I found a designer for my logo or how I registered a trademark got a lot of attention. Eventually, I started talking a lot about AWS because I was using it for my business, and many people seemed to like my perspective. (This was what inspired me to choose this as the topic for my first product.) I rarely talk about AWS anymore, mostly because it's not something I'm dealing with regularly right now.\n\nFollower growth happened gradually and slowly from 2K to 15K. It didn't happen linearly either. There were many flat weeks, and occasionally something resonated a bit more and brought in a spike of a few hundred followers. After 15K, growth became more linear and steady, and lots of new followers seem to come for word of mouth recommendations.\n\nIn the early days, I also gained a good amount of followers by joining the conversation under the tweets of other popular accounts. This is actually how I started tweeting about AWS. I'd just jump in with my perspective whenever I see something I have an opinion on. I had even set up phone notifications on a few relevant accounts so that as soon as they tweet I'd get a chance to jump in early. (I don't do this anymore, but in the beginning it's a great strategy.)\n\nAs for the mistakes I did, I wasted a lot of time talking about things I had no credibility on. You can talk about anything, but if you don't have credibility on the topic, people will just tune it out.",

Only 10% of the affiliates made any sales, and most came from the top 3.\n\nBefore I onboarded those 100, I had a couple of affiliates who joined in the early days because they asked me to. I wasn't particularly happy with how one of them was promoting my products (I felt they were being borderline spammy), but since they were bringing a few sales I felt guilty stopping them. Since then I've been more cautious in who to onboard and I make sure they give me a good explanation of how they're going to promote. If their answer doesn't convince me, I tell them that I'll consider them for a future batch. The most successful affiliates have their own mailing lists or a popular website.",

Say, you created the extremely high-value Twitter Audience video, now how did you distribute it to the paid users? Did you host your videos on an Amazon S3 instance and provided the buyers with a downloadable link? Or something else?\n\n    \nAlso, for your e-book, how did you manage the distribution among your audience and also how did you manage to take care of content theft? Like suppose, I bought your e-book for $x and started selling the same thing for $1.5x ??",

I initially launched my product at a super cheap launch offer and saw amazing conversions - but after I put the price up to what I imagined the ceiling to be, they have not sold steadily ever since and require a lot of pushing to even sell any. \n\nThe concern obviously is also the same as Jobs had, if you just sold thousands of phones, and then the next week you lower the price substantially - how would that make buyers feel?  \n\n\nI'll start experimenting with price to find out if there's a better point.",

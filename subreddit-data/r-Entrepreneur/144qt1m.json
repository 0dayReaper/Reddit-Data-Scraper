    "postText": "I'm planning to hire a part time handyman. He will work for me and another handyman I rent him out to.\n\nHe'll pay me to use him while I provide him with coverage/training/ equipment everything. \n\nAlso I'll pay him a guaranteed 100$ a week regardless of hours worked. As long as he's on call for 10 of them a week. \n\n\nNow heres the thing: The guy I'm renting to has only given me a kinda range for how much a week he will rent him.\n\nI want to keep the gig part time so I'll limit it to 10-25 hours per week.\n\nAnd the guy will be paid 22 $ hour while the main handyman pays me 32$ per hour the guys being used.\n\nOnly problem is that I can't guarantee the amount of hours he'll get. Maybe set the minimum for the rent guy to 10 hours?\n\n\nAlso please point out problems with this staffing structure.",

On call only the days scheduled to be.\n\n Show up for an hr or 2 on an odd day here and there.\n\nBy the end of the week your looking at a potential 330$ extra a week for barely any time used.",

One problem I see with this staffing structure is that you could potentially lose money if the renter isn't using the guy for enough hours. Maybe try to negotiate a more specific range of rental hours to ensure profitability. Best of luck!",

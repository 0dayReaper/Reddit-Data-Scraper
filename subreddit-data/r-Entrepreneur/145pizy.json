If I need to purchase someone's course to get access to a paid community, that's fine.\n\nI specifically am looking for a paid community since most free groups are filled with posts like:\n\n* How do I make money online?\n* If you had $50,000,000 what business would you start?\n* What are your top 69 business books?\n\nI'm looking to learn from more experienced people and network with them to find opportunities where we may end up working together.\n\nI'm willing to pay a few hundred dollars a month if I need to (maybe more if the value is there.)",

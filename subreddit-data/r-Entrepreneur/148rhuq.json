    "postText": "I have been designing an app that addresses some obvious needs in the language learning niche. There a lot of opportunities with this app, but I have only designed what I think will be a good starting point, an MVP/Phase 1\n\nI have casually showed these designs to around 20 friends/acquaintances who are actively learning another language and explained more of the overall vision for the future\n\nAbout half of them are excited immediately, expressing their desire to use the app and willingness to pay. I am pretty good at reading people, it seems to be genuine excitement, not just being nice. A few of the others seem to get the idea and like it, but have a hard time visualizing using the app just from the designs. A few of them seemed completely uninterested.\n\n20 is obviously not a high number, but I have done a good deal of market research on this as well and I am confident it is needed\n\nI have reached out to a few devs and it seems I could get a really basic MVP built for around $500-$1000. This would be enough for me to see if people who seem interested but can't visualize from designs would actually be on board. If that goes well, for another 2-3k I could probably get something I wouldn't mind charging people for. It would be far from complete, but useful enough for now. This also gives me the chance to start building a team\n\nI have also thought about completely fleshing out the designs, creating a professional presentation of it, showing people and trying to get people to sign up before having any product at all. But I honestly feel weird about that\n\nOne of my main concerns is I don't have a team. I have enough money to get a decent app built to start, but I would need to start making money soon in order to keep iterating, improving and marketing it. If I don't, I feel like Ill just be doing market validation for everyone else with deeper pockets or actual teams.\n\nSo a few questions arise:\n\nShould I have a prototype built or just go with the presentation?\n\nIf just the presentation...\n\nWhat happens if people pay me but not enough to get it built?\n\nIf I don't ask for money, and instead just a waiting list, how could I find a good target number for building it?\n\nHow could I find a good target number to start reaching out to potential co-founders (either technical or financial)\n\nHow can I build a team with limited money?\n\nMy strengths are ux design, user research, customer relations, talking to people in general, good knowledge of marketing\n\nMy weaknesses are coding, ui design (improving), and the details like finances/laws/taxes/paperwork",

As a senior lead app/web dev, if it helps you, I wouldn't mind bouncing some ideas or helping you in terms of putting together a balanced team or going over resumes. I can maybe also advice you on what tech to use, help you understand if those quotes you got are realistic (or if you are being scammed). If you'd like, drop me a PM and I'll send you my discord handle. \n\nAll the best!",

Don't worry too much about the people who didn't get it yet. Just focus on the people who did get it... what did they like about it? Will they actually pay you? Does it work for them? Do they recommend you to their friends?\n\nFocus courageously. Just find the 10 people who need your help the most and totally blow their minds. With a real product. (It's OK to do things in the background, aka \"do thing that don't scale\" to make their experience awesome... err on the side of building less and talking to people more.)",

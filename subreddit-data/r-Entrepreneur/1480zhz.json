I\u2019m wondering what you all think of offering drone photo/video packages for local tourist attractions- boat rental/jet ski rentals-  real estate agents- golf courses..\n\nI feel like it would be a pretty easy thing to sell and it wouldn\u2019t take much work. Thoughts?",

They also scan farm fields to monitor crops, moisture, variations of seed success.\n\nI have another friend who owns a drone business for the last 10 years and they go around shooting video of resorts,  hotels, golf courses, etc.\n\nI think if you have a niche you can do well with it. I saw a post last week in r/chicago where a drone op was following sailboats and taking great video. Sailboat owners typically have money and would love to get shots of their vessel underway with a beautiful backdrop of the coast in the background. People on vacation may want drone shots of their parasailing excursion or something like that.",

It's no longer cost prohibitive, or skill prohibitive, or legally prohibitive, for literally anyone to do their own drone shots.\n\nFor less than $300, your average idiot can buy a drone that can get AMAZING shots.\n\nEditing the video into something amazing is hard... But actually flying the drone and getting amazing footage? My grandma (literally) can do it.",

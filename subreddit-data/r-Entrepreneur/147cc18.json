    "postText": "Hello entrepreneurs! I'm considering starting a business with some close friends, and I'd love to hear your insights and experiences on this topic. What advice would you give when it comes to forming a partnership with friends and opening a business together? Any key factors to consider or potential pitfalls to watch out for? \n\nSome of the questions I have\n1. What factors should be considered when entering into a business partnership with friends?\n2. What would be the fair division of Income? Lets say, my friend has GC and we are planning to open an LLC under his name? What would be the percentage/ share should each on of us take?\n3. The partner who would be starting LLC would be sleeping partner and doesn\u2019t contribute anything apart from establishing company and Investment. What percentage should be he offered? And the other two will be managing all of the operations.\n4. What are some potential challenges or conflicts that can arise when starting a business with friends, and how can we proactively address them?\n5. Are there any legal or contractual considerations we should be aware of when forming a business partnership with friends?\n6. What strategies can we employ to maintain strong personal relationships while working together in a business setting?\n7. Are there any potential risks or downsides to starting a business with friends that we should be aware of?\n8.

I run all the paperwork and sales side. He runs the shop/guys/qc. There is some overlap but without him there is no buisness. I understand this and he understand that I want out... as in him to take over and buy me out because I'm not needed any more. Loan is paid off, I'm making money off minimal effort. \n\nWhat does your partner bring? what are their needs and expectations? There needs to be a 100% understanding before partnering. Don't break #2 until you understand it if you want to succeed. But... maybe you need to break it to understand it.",

If you have to do a partner route, then have a built in buy back that you can purchase Money Guy's shares after x years, or after $x of profit. This way, the one time investment doesn't haunt you forever.\n\nGC is a contract employee. Establish a very specific employment agreement, with dates / times / activities / vacation time / etc. It can be a long term contract. It can include profit sharing. It can include equity after specific VERY long term goals are met.",

Anyone with even half a brain would never convert their equity investment into a loan.\n\nGreat way to blow up a relationship for sure. Equity, you expect to win or lose together, a personal guarantee loan that isn't dischargeable that you then go and sue your friend over at their lowest point in life? Pretty much saying you no longer want to be friends. \n\nIf one of my friends came to me after already offering me equity and wanted to convert to a loan, I might already pull the investment personally.\n\nBut sure, I guess if this guy has the nicest friends on the planet or some shit, I mean, why even bother with a loan at that point? Why not just ask his friends for free money if they're that nice?",

One of the partners holds a GC-EAD, so the plan was to open an LLC under his name and provide a decent amount of shares to him, with the rest being taken care of by myself. This was the initial plan, but the EAD guy also wants to have an equal share of the investment. This is where I ran into confusion on how to share the equity or profits with him. Since he is the sleeping partner and doesn't put in any effort, should he receive an equal share as the active partner?\"\n\nBased on your suggestion, I can take of the other Money guy (partner #3) and get some loan to replace him but without the EAD guy, I have no other option. Please suggest",

What factors should be considered when entering into a business partnership with friends?\n\nWhether or not you wish to remain friends.  Whether or not you want to rely on a friend for your income. Whether or not your friend's drama will become your drama.\n\n  \n2. What would be the fair division of Income? Let's say, my friend has GC and we are planning to open an LLC under his name? What would be the percentage/ share should each one of us take?\n\nAnd now you have your first fight. Broke guy will want as much as possible. Not broke guy will want to reinvest into the business. Guy who did sweat equity (never do this, btw) will want to get paid. Guy who doesn't care, doesn't care.\n\n  \n3. The partner who would be starting LLC would be sleeping partner and doesn\u2019t contribute anything apart from establishing company and Investment. What percentage should be he offered? And the other two will be managing all of the operations.\n\nAnd now you have a second fight. Starting guy is putting in money one time? And then profits for life? Nice gig. And you all will resent him for it, sooner or later. Or broke guy will keep needling this guy for more money. So will Sweat Equity. Money guy will wonder when will this all end. Others wonder why he wants a cut when \"he doesn't do anything.\" Don't give equity, get a loan.\n\n  \n4. What are some potential challenges or conflicts that can arise when starting a business with friends, and how can we proactively address them?\n\nI've been doing this for 25+ years. I can count the number of times stuff like this didn't end in tears on one finger, with fingers left over.\n\nIf you need money, get loans, not a partner. If you need someone to do the work, hire employees, don't get partners. \n\n  \n5. Are there any legal or contractual considerations we should be aware of when forming a business partnership with friends?\n\nFirst, don't do it. Second, lawyer up. Third, consider a separate structure. Borrow from Money Guy, hire Sweat Equity guy. Hire Broke Guy. And if any of them has a personal life that is in shambles. walk away. Seriously, Sweat Equity will always bitch about not getting paid. The other guy will want to hire 6 people to do his job, and will want to take a 6 month vacation right away, using Money Guy's money. \n\n  \n6. What strategies can we employ to maintain strong personal relationships while working together in a business setting?\n\nFirst, don't do it. Second, lawyer up. Third, consider a separate structure. Borrow from Money Guy, hire Sweat Equity guy. Hire Broke Guy. And if any of them has a personal life that is in shambles. walk away. (seriously, Drunk Guy, Divorcing Guy, etc will all bring their personal drama to th office and make it your problem.)  \n7. Are there any potential risks or downsides to starting a business with friends that we should be aware of?\n\nYes, this is a bad idea and a guarantee to lose friends, money, and time. Do not do this.\n\n  \n8. What steps can we take to manage conflicts or disagreements that may arise within the partnership and protect out friendship?\n\nYou can't. This doesn't work. If you want it to work, don't partner up. Money Guy can make a higher interest loan and earn interest, and isn't a partner. Sweat Equity guys are contract employees. Maybe they can gain equity after they hit a sales / performance goals over the course of a few years. Broke Guy and Life in Shambles Guy need to set up their own separate companies that you can hire. \n\nSpeak with a lawyer now and pay for a \"real life\" consult. Ask the lawyer how often these deals work out. Please consider setting these up as separate companies that you can contract with and walk away from. \n\nTrust me. Partners will never fail to disappoint. Doubly so if they aren't bringing significant cash to the table.",

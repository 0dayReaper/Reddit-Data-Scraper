    "postText": "I\u2019ve owned many restaurant franchises and gas stations. Dabbled in liquor stores, trucking, and small residential properties. The gas station business won\u2019t be around forever with the rise of hybrids and EVs; I fear it will be hard to sell in 10 years. I want to shift my business away from restaurants (not enough profit for the work) and gas stations (plenty of profit today, but not tomorrow).\n\nWith somewhere between 800k-1.5M cash, what are some ideas that will take me through the next decade or two?\n\nI\u2019m considering residential/commercial properties, maybe a motel or UPS franchise. I don\u2019t want something as involved/stressful as managing restaurants or trucks. It is hard to keep up with equipment repairs, hiring and firing dozens of employees, theft, inventory management, competition opening up down the street, ect.\n\nI know I\u2019m asking for a unicorn cash cow, but just want some ideas that my traditional brain hasn\u2019t thought of, preferably from people with personal experience. \n\nCurrently pulling around 20-25k a month profit.",

I absolutely love detailing my own car, so maybe an auto wash with optional full service hand detailing could be interesting. Only problem is I live in Washington state where it rains 50% of the time.\n\nAs for the motel, I have some friends with smaller operations in bad parts of town, it\u2019s definitely a little tough. However two of my friends have very nice motels next to a ski resort and a business center, those are considerably less work day to day. Considering the income to work ratio, it would work for me. Restaurant franchise income to work ratio is too low.",

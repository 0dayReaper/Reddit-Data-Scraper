    "postText": "I've bought over a ring hire company last year, I've been going back and forth with names for the business, which will offer more than just the ring hire, my initial idea was to use my last name followed by ring hire and fight sport services, as I will also offer ring announcer services, aswell as officials (judges and referees for the fight shows) aswell as ring hire extras (cat walk, lights, Star cloth etc), however this was too long and decided I don't want my name attached to the business. I then decided to go with just fight sport services, however when abbreviated it would read \"FSS\" which I feel just makes you read it as \"F\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2ck sakes\" which is obviously not what I'd be looking for \n\nCan anybody who's a better at marketing than me, help suggest any names that might help and don't lead to silly sounding anagrams, I'm based in glasgow Scotland aswell if this helps with any names \n\nAny suggestions will be appreciated, thank you! \n\nTino",

My experience has been that people don't necessarily pay that much attention to the name of a business. The only time I notice a business is when I see the name and I have no idea what they do, which is obviously not good for the biz.",

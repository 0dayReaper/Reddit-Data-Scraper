If you ask web devs to build a site slightly outside of what they're used to, they have a difficult time doing it. I think it has to do with not having the budget (or sometimes the interest) in researching the target audience and looking at similar websites in the niche.\n\nOP, if you want to connect and talk more about the challenges and my experience, reach out.",

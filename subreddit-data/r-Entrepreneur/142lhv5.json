    "postText": "I've been asked to join the board of a non-profit in Belgium and am also working on an IT product for them. \n\nI used to be self-employed and resident in the UK and just invoiced companies and paid tax on it in the UK. This is hopefully going to be a more long-term appointment and i've moved to Portugal, and am now planning on moving to Spain. I'm trying to work out how i should set up to pay taxes. \n\nI'm happy to pay a fair amount, but the tax on my Gross rate in Belgium is about 50% and i'm planning to move to Spain where corporate and self-employed taxes are also around 50%, leaving me pretty close to minimum wage for a highly skilled role.\n\nIs there a better way to set up?",

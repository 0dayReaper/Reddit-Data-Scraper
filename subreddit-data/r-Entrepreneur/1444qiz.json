    "postText": "I've ran as a food cottage operation for about a year now and I've sold a few of pastries to coworkers, family and friends.\n\nIt started out as horrible pastries but we've finally found a recipe that works and everyone seems to be impressed by.\nI want to know how to make my first sale outside of family &amp; friends.\n\nThe product is a very specific type of pastry that can be created in different flavors. I would like to keep it simple with about 10/14 flavors/ combinations. Some are sweet/desserts. And others are savory/appetizers/cocktail snacks.\n\nI've done a ton of research into the possibilities; catering, selling through distributors, stores or to restaurants, selling online, farmer's markets, opening a niche bakery, etc.\n\nThe more research I do the more complicated and expensive everything seems, getting permits, licensing, buying sku's, branding, getting marketing materials, etc.\n\nAll the business models (mentioned above seem to have complex requirements and challenges totally different from each other and I'm having a hard time figuring out which business model I want to go forward with.\n\nI don't mind jumping through hoops to get the business going but I feel like this one product is pulling me in all directions into totally different business ventures.\n\nWhat would be the best way to get started?",

However, start with small quantities, so that, should things go South, you can limit the damage.\n\nOtherwise, I would suggest to place your products in stores with shared profit, this would give you a market product fit and price suitability idea.",

Once you have that settled, you can then decide if you want to stick with online or move onto selling to stores, restaurants, etc. Plus, who doesn't love ordering pastries online?",

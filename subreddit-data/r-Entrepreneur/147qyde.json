    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nA few years ago I created a pdf document which details a business idea that I came up with several years ago and ran myself to generate a very decent side-income for several years. I sole several copies of the document on Ebay etc and had very positive feedback. I am now in the process of re-writing the document and making it more professional looking and more up-to-date. I would like to market this properly as a legitimate, unique side hustle and sell it on places other than Ebay. I am considering building my own website to sell it on but wondering what other people have done in the past in situations like this? Any advice would be much appreciated,",

If you have the Facebook group, then you\u2019ll be able to charge more for your product, and you may be able to get reoccurring revenue, depending on what it is and if there\u2019s value in staying connected to the expert (you). Then go on TikTok and make 20 videos today. Literally just spam tiktok. Tiktoks algorithm is fucking insane and will connect you to the exact niche people that you were looking for.",

Anyone can do it and it's quite exciting. I worked hard for 5 hours a week on average for about a year and made about $25K. It's quite unique  - I came up with the idea myself when I saw no one else was doing it. In term's of pricing I had sold a few copies before on Ebay for around $100 and people seemed happy with that.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nYes, it is totally possible to make money without spending any in 2023ff.\n\nThe only tools you need are free.\n\nI\u2019ve spent $1,000 on the Mighty Networks annual plan while making $50 / month from my group there.Shiny-Object Syndrome is a bitch.You need none of those things!\n\nWhat we do is this:\n\n# Audience Building and Testing\n\n1. Use Twitter to build and test your audience. It's the best platform because you're forced to write concisely with the character limit.And you get direct feedback if people like it.Plus, instant networking with DMs.\n2. Comment under big accounts. 20-30 replies per day is doable. Make it add value to the initial tweet.Schedule 3-5 tweets on your own Timeline with [Hypefury](https://selfconquering.com/go/hypefury) (free).Write one thread per week where you expand on a topic that worked well.Use the autoplug feature from Hypefury to send people directly to your email newsletter on good tweets.\n3. Use [beehiiv](https://selfconquering.com/go/beehiiv)(free) to write emails. It also autocreates a \"blog\" with all your emails. So no need for an extra website.\n4. Emails that are welcomed put on Reddit, Medium, Quora, Indie Hackers, etc. Figure out where your audience is and just copy paste it there.Yes, you can do that. It's your content.\n5. Use [Notion.so](https://Notion.so) to create a course about a topic your audience likes and go DEEP. Add tons of value.\n6. Use [Gumroad.com](https://Gumroad.com) or [zapier.com](https://zapier.com) to automatically send buyers the Notion page. (all free)\n7. Wanna add videos? Sure. Use Your phone to record, get DaVinci Resolve (free) and upload them to Youtube (set unlisted so they don't appear on your public profile) or [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com) and embed in Notion.\n\nThere you have it.\n\n$0 spent (except taxes ofc), but making money easily online. No cap upwards.\n\nPaid plans of all these tools really only add convenience which you can buy later.\n\nLiterally zero excuses these days.\n\nAlexander\n\nPS: If this added value to your day and business, please share some love to the [Twitter Thread that sparked it.](https://twitter.com/selfconquering/status/1664303092018434050)",

You then went on to promote several non-free services and left out the simple fact that none are free time. \n\nNo website? really? so just keep spamming people in forums and other service for the rest of your life?\n\nBuilding a Twitter community is work and promoting one's business by way of inserting spam on twitter will likely get you very few if any followers and most likely you will end up banned.\n\nYour post is an poor example of self promotion and will likely get the same results here.\n\nYou do not have a sustainable vision of success.",

Of course, they have paid plans. But you don't need that in the beginning.\n\nOf course there is zero talk about how to scale later (in which case you will need to establish your website, brand and domain name, but don't you think it's much better to test your message first before spending time and effort on these things?)\n\nAnd yeah the mighty networks was a negative example of what you DON'T need.\n\nMy lessons learned.\n\nWhich I decided to share.\n\nHave a good day, friend!",

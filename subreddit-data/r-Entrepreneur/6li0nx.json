    "postText": "I am so sick and tired of going on Facebook and seeing advertisements, everywhere, for expensive courses/books/guides on \"Optimizing Facebook ads\" or \"Learning to A/B split test Facebook ads for maximum profit\".\n\nIt seems like another Facebook marketing guru I haven't heard of pops up every week, with another piece of garbage on learning how to market something on Facebook. So here's the simple truth: They are not teaching you anything revolutionary. Everything you could possibly need is available, for free, from Facebook themselves through this thing called Facebook Blueprint. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/blueprint/courses/path/all-content\n\nEvery possible thing you would need, from beginner to experienced Facebook ads user, is here. There is even an official certification (paid) that gets you certified **by Facebook** once you go through the course and complete an exam. Want to learn how to structure campaigns for a small business? There's a [course](https://www.facebook.com/blueprint/courses/category/small-and-medium-businesses) for that. Are you an experienced ads user and want to learn about the Power Editor? There's a course for that (http://facebook.exceedlms.com/student/home/show_enrollment/42769427). There's a course for almost every single thing within Facebook, for free. \n\nEDIT: \"But catch3!!! I'm a fish farmer and I like how the super special online guru holds my hand through the whole *spiritual* process of setting up my campaign with a **sales funnel** to target other fisheries in my area! The courses on Facebook Blueprint don't have ANYTHING related to my niche! And we have an exclusive forum where we can sing songs and hold hands together!\" - Ok, then use an online guru, just make sure that you're getting what you paid for. \n\nI know this comes off as ranty, but I'm sick of these gurus taking advantage of people who don't know that most, if not all of the information they are looking for is out there, for free. \n\nEDIT2: Bonus link from an AskReddit thread earlier this week: https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage",

Most of what you need to know you can get from reading the documentation on FB, AdWords, Google Analytics, etc. That will get you the core concepts, teach you the interface and such.\n\nThe first thing I'd do with new entry-level people is make them read the docs front to back. It took a lot of time, but they were actually useful afterwards.\n\nGoogle and FB try very hard to make it easy to spend lots of money very quickly, while simultaneously making you believe you are seeing success with fluff metrics.  Managing a campaign intelligently is the hard part, and that takes experience, and spending lots of money learning what works and what doesn't.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a highly technical field. You should understand the basics of HTML and Javascript at some point, because you'll need to know about conversion tracking. You'll need to understand the difference between \"push\" vs. \"pull\" media, things like why you should discount your view-through conversions if you're doing display, why certain targeting settings are garbage.\n\nThose are things Google and FB won't always tell you because it often does not align with their financial interests.\n\nThat said, it STILL isn't worth paying a guru. Join /r/ppc, /r/analytics, etc. and start engaging with the community, I swear we don't bite. Then go to industry meetups and make friends.\n\nIf you're going to spend money on anything, spend it on hiring a local consultant who you can meet face to face, learn from them, and make sure you are getting a return on investment.\n\nBut for learning the basics, OP is absolutely 100% correct.",

I want to also add one small note if you're ever hiring an ad agency or company for a marketing campaign 1,000,000 reach vs 1,000,000 impressions is a HUGE difference. A single person can easily be served the same post multiple times whereas reaching the same number of people takes a great deal more effort. \n\n/u/haltingpoint I know this is random, but do you have any advice for someone trying to get a new marketing job? I have 6 years social media experience. Have grown our FB audience from 130,000 to 10,000,000. Yet after sending out 100 resumes over the past 2 weeks, I haven't received a single call for an interview.",

For example, FB tries to tell you that you are getting great engagement with your videos, but those are 3 second views unless you're looking at the correct column. I don't know about you, but unless your ad is like a Geico ad, 3 seconds isn't worth jack.\n\nRe: your question, what sort of marketing are you looking to get into? I would need to know more about your background. I'm client side now and the best thing I ever did for my career was diversify my skills. I've done everything in digital marketing and am VERY deep in several areas.\n\nGoing from the social world is hard because to be honest, social media people are a dime a dozen. That was our hardest role to get solid resumes for when I was hiring for a social manager on the earned/owned side.\n\nIf you want to stay in the social world, I'd suggest getting good about custom audiences, particularly on the technical side. Knowing how to get data from one place to another, or write a technical spec for an engineer to do it is critical. Likewise for conversion tracking, uploading your own 1st party conversion data, etc.\n\nBeyond that I'd suggest getting deeper on the attribution and analytics side. The hardest part of social is proving your value and roi in a world that is largely still last click, direct response. Being able to show your engagement campaigns create a halo-effect and generate increment lift in revenue is arguably one of the toughest challenges in the space right now. Those who can prove this with data and statistics get ahead and are in demand.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to chat further. Hope this helps.",

I find that the term \"social media intern\" generally works the best, because these are the smaller companies that probably do not have anyone solely responisble for the social media strategy.\n\nI am from Toronto, so for example, I would look at this job: https://www.indeed.ca/viewjob?jk=9f053c8067f042c9&amp;q=social+media+intern&amp;l=toronto%2Contario&amp;tk=1bkf3f64n5i9ec0f&amp;from=web \n\nStep 2) Research that company and all their social media stuff. I would find ways to improve it. For example, they only have 700-800 Facebook fans? That is a very small amount, and something I know I could improve for them. \n\nStep 3) I would find out who the hiring manager is of that company, or who is responsible for the social media management. I would sometimes secretly message the Facebook page and find out that way, but I want to get the name / email of the person who can make the decision to hire me. \n\nStep 4) I would write a polite email to them explaining exactly who I am, what I have done and how I can help their business. I basically tell them that instead of hiring X person, they could save money by just working with me for X per month. I would recommend to be clear and concise in your marketing packages. \n\nFor example: \"400$ per month means I will spend 5 hours per week monitoring social media comments, I will post 5 unique images per week and I will engage with 100 external accounts to help grow your brand.\" \n\nI have done this several times and it has helped me get work where I can work from home / anywhere as long I have internet and a computer. I would recommend looking in your local area first though, because many of these people will still want to meet with you at least once every couple weeks or each month. \n\nI am sure there are also other methods, but it did take about a dozen or so companies before I was able to get a lead this way. But it has opened a lot of doors in terms of side-hustles. ",

If you go by what other people charge, I undercharge for the most part because of this. I hate seeing small businesses ask me to teach them things that they could learn for free, and almost always bring up the free ways to learn it themselves first. \n\nIt's not great business sense I suppose, but I don't want to give myself a bad name and it can lead to long term gigs like website management which they don't seem to learn as easily or just don't have the time. I'm almost certain I had a point but after writing all that I don't know where I was going with it.",

In this business as long as you are good, you only need one or 2 clients with connections with other businesses. \n\nI did this 15 years ago and the first place I went to had a contract with a large IT services company, I walked in and immediately solved a problem that had affected them for years (network problems/simple DNS change), they immediately shitcanned the other company and handed me a big to do list.  \n\nI do have reasonable social skills and began with just talking and getting to the people who make the decisions (fortunately the owner was in and actively frustrated at the long occurring issue the other company couldn't solve). \n\nEveryone has computer problems and aren't shy about letting you know.  Fix it on the spot and you're a god.\n\nThat was enough to get me started and pretty soon someone else he knew had similar issues, he referred me, they turned into another client, and so on and so forth.\n\nToday I have never spent a dime on advertising and am actually at the point of deciding to go full company or staying a freelancer and just not accepting new clients because I am overwhelmed with work.  Not a bad \n\nproblem to have.\n\nThere are so many people in IT that shouldn't be there, including an alarmingly large portion of large companies providing outsourced support. If you know your shit, this business is ez. If you have a decently large skill set (I offer full IT services from support to SEO/Web development and internet marketing) you can make a damn good living, freelancing, for just a handful of companies.\n\nOf course I got lucky in a number of ways but the point is, there are thousands of companies looking for competent technology services  sometime you gotta go find them.\n\nEdit: PM me with your resume and what you offer and I may be able to throw work your way sometimes.",

Fortunately I landed a full stack web dev internship in Denmark for a few months and learned a lot about the business side. I started [my business](http://theroyalbranding.com) this week not focusing on IT issues, but rather the creative aspect because it's fun for me. \n\nSo far I've cold emailed with no response, I've spend about $40 on kajiji only to get two leads which disappeared. I didn't think cold emailing would work but this sub really recommends testing everything. I think I'm going to make a huge mistake if I funnel money into fb ads and adwords and other online ad campaigns. \n\nMy intuition tells me that people who really need a website are people who don't have a large online presence anyway. \n\nSo on Thursday I thought, 'why don't i just go to the small office parks around the city and walk in a booklet that has web designs and a little bit about me'. So I'm pretty excited to see your recommendation of going door to door. Even happier knowing that your really do just need to make about 5 websites before word of mouth kicks in (and the backlinks from those sites put you high on google maps). \n\nCould you tell me more about how to cold walk-in smoothly?",

There's an exceptional amount of free information available about Facebook ads (and every other subject on the planet). You're not paying someone to hand you those links with information, you're paying someone who has spent their time already absorbing that information, to the point that they're able to distill it and communicate it in a more consumable format.\n\nAgain, I could buy Quickbooks and teach myself how to do accounting for my small business. I could pour through the IRS website and numerous other websites with free information. I would eventually get to the end goal. And along the way I probably would have spent countless hours consuming a ton of irrelevant information that I have no use for.\n\nOr I could enroll in an online \"Accounting for Small Business\" course and save myself the time and energy. Sure, that course might be pulling most of its info from the IRS website and the same resources I would have used, but that's literally what I'm paying for -- them to distill that mass amount of information into exactly what is relevant to a small business, so I don't have to spend my time and energy inefficiently deciphering what is and isn't important to me.\n\nAs with Facebook ads: there is an absurd amount of information available that is wholly irrelevant to small businesses, but might be more relevant to larger businesses. There is information specifically for eCommerce sites vs. brick and mortar businesses. There are ad strategies appropriate for photographers and musicians that aren't appropriate for a fashion retailer. Most business owners absolutely shouldn't be interested in spending their time and energy studying the entirety of Facebook advertising just so they're able to distinguish between these different paths. That's why you pay for others to distill the information into what you specifically need, and translate it into a meaningful process you can adopt and implement. \n\nPeople are saying \"hire a consultant\" as if that's not precisely what a consultant does -- they distill information for you and advise you on your particular needs. Yes, there are good and bad people doing this in the Facebook ads \"coaching\" realm. Find the good. Just because there are bad doesn't mean the whole industry is trying pull the wool over your eyes.",

LEARN HOW I MAKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH FROM MY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT! FREE WEBINAR SESSION IN TWO WEEKS. SIGN UP NOW!\"\n\nIn reality, it may seem free but it comes at a cost. Your email address. Then, with that email, they keep sending you advertisements. So no, most gurus on the large-scale platforms like Facebook and Instagram are still taking advantage of you through this \"free\" session.\n\nI even attended one of the guru's webinars. Everything he taught, I learned through scrolling through reddit/searching online. Then, two months later, I saw he was hosting another webinar session so I checked in again, this time posting a one-time email account which would let me access his webinar.\n\nEVERYTHING HE SAID IN THE WEBINAR WAS THE EXACT SAME AS TWO MONTHS AGO. I could've swore he just pre-recorded it and played it back to his audience. He even had the same affiliate links at the end which would help promote sales funnels.\n\nI back you fully. Most gurus nowadays use the same marketing tactic. They give you an absurd possibility (making thousands of dollars from home with some simple tactic) but at a price which usually costs a monthly payment or a free session and then a monthly payment but all in all, you can find all their strategic lessons through some website or catalog.\n\nIt really isn't that hard if you're willing to do the research.",

I don't want to find out after buying into their program that it's just as long and confusing and full of useless information as their free stuff. And, there's the one guy who charges $10,000 for his course that says he posts 97% of it for free. Well, I'm lost at your website and I bet your course is just as confusing. \n\nSo, thank you.

However, many times social ads don't lead to immediate, direct sales, but there is still a correlation between increased sales and increased advertising (one would hope for any business). In other words, the ad campaigns generate awareness and some interest, but might not convert for quite some time -- especially in an industry or business where consumers are making a high-information purchase or the purchase cycle is long.\n\nPlenty of occasions where people are exposed to an ad, click through, but don't make any purchase/inquiry at that time. Then they come back a month later having cleared their browser cache or on a different device, Google your company or type the URL in directly and make a purchase/inquiry. Now the lead source is search or direct, rather than Facebook (even though that was the original lead source and something you should be paid for in your compensation model).\n\nThen of course there are occasions where people might see a Facebook ad that isn't necessarily relevant to them, but might be relevant for someone they know (a friend or colleague). Then they suggest their colleague/friend check out the brand and solution that was advertised. You lose compensation there too -- the lead source was technically Facebook, but there's no way to attribute the purchase to that.\n\nWhy would I set up my earning potential to neglect these likelihoods?\n\nCharge what your worth, not contingent on some fluctuating variable that's as volatile as conversions from social.",

Anyone can throw up some ads but if you are competing in a crowded market and need to beat the others (to have an acceptable ROI) there are a lot of things that make a difference. ",

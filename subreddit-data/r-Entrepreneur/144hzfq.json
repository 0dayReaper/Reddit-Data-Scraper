    "postText": "I currently run a lead gen business producing leads in the home improvement business. It\u2019s been very lucrative but chasing around clients has become very annoying as I\u2019m sure many of you have experience. We do net 14(meaning we bill every 14 days and have a 7 day grace period). ACH would obviously be better then billing with stripe, but sometimes just isn\u2019t as easy.\n\nDoes anyone know of any processors that allow you to auto bill customers so I don\u2019t even have to request their permission I just build them every two weeks and send them an invoice?",

Then when you create an invoice, you can auto charge their payment method.",

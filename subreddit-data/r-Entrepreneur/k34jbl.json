    "postText": "I spent 10yrs in a career of branding/advertising and went from knowing no programming to launching my first product in a year.\n\nIt won't be for everybody but if you're on the fence about switching careers or learning to code, I'd definitely recommend it. Even if it's just to see if you like it.\n\nI learned by doing a short course on Udemy and then just watching a ton of YouTube videos.\n\nHere's my website for reference: [www.llamalife.co](https://www.llamalife.co)\n\n(It's a productivity application which helps provide structure and focus to get work done).\n\nFeel free to ask anything about the journey. Not going to lie, it was a hard slog, but extremely happy I did it.\n\n**Edit: for typos**\n\n**Edit 2: adding resources**\n\n**Edit 3: this was fun, thanks guys. Going to bed now. In Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa. Will answer other comments in the morning.**\n\n**Edit 4: 9:20am AEST Nov 30th - good morning from Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd98! Back answering questions now. Thanks for all the support, especially the discussion on pricing! It's an area I struggle with, and yes it's probably priced too low for a Lifetime deal. Will have to reassess that.**\n\n**Edit 5: 3:22pm AEST Nov 30th - thanks for the great discussion guys. That was fun. I'm going to go now and close this up - better start working again on the actual product \ud83d\ude1d.** \n\n**Here's a few more details based on the common questions:** \n\n1. **What tech stack did you use?** I took a jamstack approach... javascript/React, Express, Firebase, Netlify, Heroku, Stripe.\n2. **What tools do you use for design?** Sketch\n3. **What did this look like in the beginning?** [this](https://twitter.com/threehourcoffee/status/1225241414667161600) \n4. **How did you get your first customers?** Got my first customers by building in public. Building in public also helps to keep me accountable. To do this I mostly posted on Twitter, just low quality progress videos (nothing fancy) and design screenshots. You can follow and see history on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/threehourcoffee). I've also made a subreddit to engage customers for feedback [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/llamalifeapp/)  And a weekly productivity newsletter which is about providing value to customers first, and then product news second, [here](https://llamalife.substack.com/).  Please know, there is not just one way to do this, everyone is different and every business is different. And my business is far from successful yet, so take it for what it is but adapt for your own specific situation. \n5. **How do I know which programming language to choose?** There's a lot of good advice in the thread. But for me it starts with knowing the goal - which in my case was primarily learning to code a website and to release a product that I developed by myself. Knowing I wanted to do a website, helped guide the programming choice, so I started with javascript. If you're interested in say modelling or algorithms you might choose python. Start with the goal.\n6. **What are some good resources to learning javascript?** First figure out your learning style. For me I'm terrible with books, so I opted for more video learning and did a course on Udemy and then watched a lot of YouTube videos. If videos are your thing then I can recommend these resources: \n   1. Udemy - Jonas S's html, css, javascript course\n   2. Youtube - Wes Bos, Traversy Media, Dev Ed, Academind, Net Ninja, Web Dev Simplified\n   3. Websites - javascript30, freecodecamp, google and stackOverflow\n\nThanks again, good luck and all the best!",

But my brain is too small to extrapolate from a few gifs to how I am going to use this product myself. Especially when I have no prior knowledge of the product. If I'm in the market for pomodoro timers, and this website shows up, I know what to expect\n\nTo the creator, just to be clear, I actually like the website. But seeing it and understanding it are two different things. Here's a suggestion though. Instead of countdowns only you could also allow timers. So one could measure the time spent on different tasks. Or both at the same time: I spent a total of 4h doing a task A, 2h on task B, and had a pomodoro every 25mins",

Of course, if you are good and experienced developer you would structure your code so it would be easy to switch. It's hard to make mistakes if you use mysql, mongo or something similar.",

(Usually good for personal use)\n\nJava is good for writing code for big corporations. (Enterprise software) However I\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone who\u2019d disagree with me on that.\n\nC is good if you\u2019re wanting to write software that interacts very closely with hardware. (Think of writing a game engine) You\u2019re not going to be writing a web app in C.\n\nC++ is good for a lot of the same stuff as C, but has some similarities to java. (It\u2019s an object oriented language, which is a whole can of worms to explain, but it\u2019s kind of a big change from C)\n\nJavaScript is the web app daddy of the world at the moment. If you want to quickly make a web app that could turn profit, learn JavaScript and some web frameworks.(Look up MERN stack) \n\nWhen you first start programming, I suggest sticking with one language for a while to learn the significance of syntax and some basic data structures. Just keep in mind whatever language you choose can affect how difficult a project could be for you in the future. So if you have an idea for something you\u2019d like to program, choose your language accordingly. But also don\u2019t get too caught up on picking a language. Eventually you can branch off into different coding disciplines.",

Front-end frameworks are React.js and Angular. This code is sent to the user and is rendered on his PC. And there's also a database which can be MySQL, SQLite Postgres etc. SQLite is beginner friendly and is suitable for smaller projects.\nNormally, a web application would include a front and back-end framework and a database. \n\nFor smaller projects that you don't want to waste a lot of time on or when you're just starting, you might not want to use a front-end framework. All of the back-end frameworks such as Django or Java Spring have a template \"language\". You can just write the back-end i.e. the functionalities of the application and HTML/CSS/JS in the same project and the server will the send the templates you create. \nThis is a really important thing to understand when starting out and I'm not great at explaining so take a look at a tutorial that explains the difference. \n\nLast thing, not sure if you already have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but if you do take a look at Harvard's CS50 course \"Web Development with Django and Javascript\". It's free and it's beginner friendly.",

If you're interested in websites you'd be more into JavaScript full stack or just frontend with maybe Python or PHP backend, etc. If you're more into apps things like Java, Swift, ObjectiveC would be better although you may still learn a backend language for your API. There are so many more applications: games, embedded systems, etc.",

I'm much better learning via video and practicing in real life to see what works and what doesn't. With video, I like that you can pause or rewind or even fast forward, and I love hearing other devs explain on videos how they thought about a problem. \n\nEveryone learns differently though, so try a few different mediums to see what works, and importantly just go for it. As some of the other commenters said, it's also important to figure out what you're interested in and talk with other devs. I really love web development so I chose javascript, but if you're more interested in say modelling or algorithms you might choose python.\n\nhope that helps.",

If you really think people will pay 6 a month, then it should be something like 49 a year and 99 for lifetime.\n\nOr if you really think you can make the numbers work, just make it $9 for lifetime, with no other options.  But then you have no room for manoeuvre when it comes to special offers.  \n\nIf you've had 60 signups at $9 in such a short time then you've priced it too low.  If you end up with thousands of customers at that price you won't be able to support them all unless you hire someone.  And with that amount of revenue you might not be able to afford it.  The costs of looking after thousands of users' data in the cloud, securely and reliably, are substantial.  You'll need proper backups, resilience and/or fault tolerance, and some serious infosec advice.  And some powerful servers.  Can you really do all that on 75 cents per user per month?  And pay yourself a salary?  And pay your taxes?",

He wants to sell the whole thing for 9 bucks, and with the other option - people are obviously going to buy it - while thinking it's a great deal. \n\nHe didn't put the 6 bucks option for people to actually buy it, it's there to influence people to buy the product for 9 bucks. It's a simple, effective and well-known marketing strategy.\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that it might be too cheap.\n\nI would rather put it around $19-29 for lifetime and $5 a month, or something like that.

Since your service is a cloud service, you're taking $6 from someone and essentially telling them that this service will be available forever. Are you actually prepared to be running this service a 3 years from now? What about 10 years from now? 20 years? And what if the majority of your users are lifetime users?

That's awesome you used covid to inspire you to read music!\n\nI get cognitive fatigue after 10 minutes so believe me when I say doing 4hrs a day was a hard slog! That said, in all seriousness, if it's something that I find interesting and challenging then I can hyperfocus on it for a long time. So that helped me a lot with learning the basics of coding. \n\nThe reason I love coding is because I can see a very tangible result from my efforts. eg if I code a new feature, it either works or it doesn't, and I can see that immediately. Something like Marketing has a more delayed effect. You might release a campaign and you won't see how it impacts the bottom line till weeks later. I love the immediate reward that comes from coding. \n\nBest of luck! And I hope Llama helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any feature requests or general feedback even - it'd help me out a lot as I'm constantly trying to improve it.",

At one point I got burned out and took a 2 week break. But after that I'd forgotten a lot of what I'd learnt. So definitely try more consistent learning, even if it's just for an hour a day.",

It means my concept of time passing is really poor so I need to make time as physical or visual as possible. I always use timers on my watch, but when working I wanted something for my desktop (because my phone is huge source of distraction). \n\nSo pick something you're interested in, but also look at it as a learning experience and just start. That way it won't seem as daunting.",

Now that I know more it's fine, but in the beginning figuring out how to structure the program eg how the front end talks to the server, to payments, to the database and then deploying all this to a hosting provider, and figuring out what tech stack to use etc. was challenging. \n\nI think the reason for this is because a lot of the help out there eg stackOverflow (which is awesome) and Medium posts etc focus on very specific topics. eg how to solve x. It's very narrow. There's not a lot of posts on how to put things together as a complete ecosystem and part of the reason for THAT is because there's multiple ways you can do this, and there's no one correct answer.",

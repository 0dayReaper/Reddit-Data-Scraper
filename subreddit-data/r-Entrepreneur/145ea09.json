Also, if you're not in a country where you can fire people on the spot, make sure the probation period is at least 6 months (especially for more senior roles).",

If you hire but don't have an exact process in place for training them and their eventual day to day you will be scrambling. Not a good image.\n\nSet aside dedicated time in your week to prepare for an employee. Your workflow is going to change, things that are \"messy\" in your workflow become REALLY messy when trying to teach another how to navigate it. \n\nObviously these may not be that important depending on your industry/the employees job but these are things that I have experienced.",

So I ended up with time loss and some minor material accidents. Next time I'll make sure to gather a well balanced team and the right process to lead them down the successful path",

It will save you hours of breaking your head and finding out that your hire has actually 0 skill in the subject\n\nIf he/she is stressed out because of anxiety during an interview, it\u2019s fine, instead start with simple \u201cbreak the ice\u201d and make it as friendly as it could be before starting with these questions\n\nNothing is more stronger than PORTFOLIO, like really. First thing you can ask is open up their portfolio and ask about how they did it, why the did it, and what they learned doing it. In this case, if their portfolio blown your mind about how good it is and you found out they 100% made it themselves while being honest -&gt; you got a very good employee!\n\nDon\u2019t cheap out \u2014 just never give them peanuts income! You might get a \u201cgood talent\u201d but they will lose their favor to actually expand their skills while working with you due to seeing your competitors giving higher wage and eventually they will lose hope even asking for a raise just because they saw someone giving 2x the wage your giving.\n\nThis is what i learned, would also love to hear what others have learned -&gt; could greatly help us all :)",

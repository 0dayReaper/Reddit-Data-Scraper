    "postText": "To all those non 9 to 5 workers?....  \nWhat do you do and if you took your hands off the wheel (so to speak) would you still be making money?  \n\n\nMaybe like most people on here, I dream of a day when I can leave a side hustle / business with minimal hands on interference and make money whilst essentially doing nothing....  \n\n\nI remember when I was younger hearing from a friend's dad that the reason he loved what he did so much is because he was able to make money while he slept lol (he had an online furniture store).  \n\n\nAre other people in similar boats? do you also have a furniture store?",

            "comment": "I don't think it's about making money while you sleep. It's that you push your value into the future. What I mean by that is you work but the sale happens in your sleep. You still worked but the value of that work was carried into the future in the sale that happened overnight. So, in essence, no one can make money while doing nothing. They can push the value they created in the past and gain money by having a sale in the future. \n\nLike the furniture store. Maybe the dad made the furniture himself or he stocked up in furniture through whole-sellers. He worked during the day or the week, but got his sale in the night. He still had to work but it's just that the money came in his sleep. \n\nRemember, 0 can never equal 1. 1 can equal 1 so you need to work regardless. And 1 (let's say it's money) is equal whether earned while working in the day or sleeping in the night.",

I still make a good few hundred \u00a3s/$s every month from these same assets, but only a couple of years it was thousands a month, all completely hands off with zero maintenance required.\n\nI've recently setup a YouTube channel and am interested to see where that goes as I think it's a relatively unique idea. Going to be a lot of hard work though, and don't expect it to make any real money for a long time to come yet.",

            "comment": "I search out and buy sought-after collectibles at low prices and put them in the hands of consignors to market and sell. I try to maximize my return with as limited an amount of time invested as possible. I utilize multiple consignors so I'm maximizing exposure of my goods. Once my items are dropped off, my time invested is largely reduced to picking up my payout check each month. For items that need a larger audience to find the right buyer, I utilize internet platforms to market them. Instead of paying a consignor, what would normally be that fee covers my time to market and ship the item. Combining these methods allows me to maximize my sales. I do all this as a hobby while working full time as a civil engineer. So, my hobby sales are happening while I sleep.",

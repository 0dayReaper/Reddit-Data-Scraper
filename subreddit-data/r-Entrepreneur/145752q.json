Different role, etc?",

            "comment": "Sector? Company stage? A broader cold outreach might help to home in on a narrower market based on who responds (if you don't have a true market in mind). However, doing this work front might result in higher open rates and engagement. Chicken and egg possibly. Either way, you'll learn and iterate.",

    "postText": "When I first started my business I was really focused on one specific market which was local service businesses like your everyday roofers, plumbers, and landscapers. Honestly that was about 99% of my customer base for the first year or two that I was open and I really couldn't complain with how things were going. Things continued going well during that time and eventually I was approached by the owner of an online store looking for help so I decided to open up my doors to new possibilities and give it a shot since he was essentially a referral from a good friend/client of mine at the time. Things quickly began to pick up and I ended up taking on a few more e-commerce clients along the way not really sure where it would end up taking me. Weirdly enough and to my surprise eventually this became the bulk of my customer base and I would say I currently sit at a 70-30 split with most of customers now being ecommerce related instead of service based businesses despite my initial push for the opposite type of client base. I'm not really sure what to make of this and I wanted to know if this is a common occurance amongst most businesses? Do you normally see big shifts in your client base?\n\nJust to be clear I'm not complaining about the situation as I enjoy any SEO work that I'm given but I feel as though most owners tend to stick with one client base throughout their careers or really narrow down to one market but like I said I'm rather new in the grand scheme of things and can see both positive and negatives to either path.

I won a horse society road safety film.  And a peanut shoot.  Then pharmaceuticals including the UK's largest pharmaceutical firm via an agency.\n\nI swore I'd never do weddings but a couple of existing customers came to me and I did... weddings.\n\nAnd a documentary for a pharma firm.  And a Japanese gameshow...  And now I think I might win a documentary about a treasure hunt for, well, a pirate's buried treasure.  Plus I'm pitching for a YouTube channel for something pretty out there.\n\nMy first love is still B2B tech and it's fantastic but this other stuff just finds me.  No SEO, no marketing in those areas... it comes through word of mouth and just sort of lands in my inbox!",

            "comment": "VBA and Excel Developer of 20 years here. My market has changed several times over the years. \n\nWhen Google Sheets arrived companies couldn't dump Excel fast enough so work dried up quickly. Fortunately, bigger companies started to realise some of the limitations of Google Sheets and returned to Excel.\n\nMost of my work was ensuring data is shared efficiently and cleanly as possible and in the early days that meant VBA and macros. Then things like cloud versions of Excel came along which did a lot of that work automatically.\n\nThen came along things like PowerBI which initially ate into the report generation area of my business. Again, a lot of companies dropped it after a while because of complexity, cost and the inability to work cleanly with non-PowerBI companies.\n\nSo my client base has ebbed and flowed over the years, but most of them still want the same core services",

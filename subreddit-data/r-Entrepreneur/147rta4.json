    "postText": "Hey fellow startup enthusiasts and entrepreneurs,  \nFor the past two months, I've been on an exciting journey - the quest for a co-founder. I thought it might be helpful to share my experience with you all, in the hopes that it might guide some of you embarking on a similar path. And of course, if anyone has advice or strategies that have worked better for them, please do share in the comments. I'm all ears!  \nNow, let's dive into the resources and strategies I've found most helpful on my co-founder hunt:  \n**Tapping into Personal Networks:** Never underestimate the power of existing connections! I started my search by reaching out to friends and acquaintances to see if they knew anyone interested or suitable. You'd be surprised how often a friend-of-a-friend is the perfect fit.\n\n   \n**YC Co-Founder Matching:** I found the Y Combinator Co-Founder matching program extremely beneficial. It allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who are also looking to embark on a startup journey. There is a limitation for 25 folks per week, but you can add people to your favorites and work wiht them after. Don't miss this opportunity!\n\n   \n**LinkedIn (personal network):**  I have more than 6500 connections on LinkedIn, and I created a post about co-founder search. Also, I reached every person in Bay Area in my network with questions to join or reshare my post. \n\n**LinkedIn (interest group)**: For me, this is the best source for finding potential co-founders. The idea is pretty simple: find the group, joined, and start messaging to group members. The first message should be super short. If people are interested then share details on whom you are looking for. Don't forget ask folks about sharing your LinkedIn post from previous advice.\n\n  \n**Offline Events:** Before you dismiss face-to-face interactions, hear me out. I've found networking events, board game nights, and hackathons to be great places to meet potential co-founders. You can observe how people problem-solve, work in a team, and handle pressure - all essential traits in a co-founder. Also, you can scan people with your nonverbal feelings. It's impossible through messages or calls. \n\n  \n**Hosting an Event:** Hosting a mastermind group, a brainstorming session, or a topic-specific event can attract like-minded individuals. This not only expanded my network but also allowed me to showcase my idea and gauge interest. But be careful, there are a lot of \"dreamers\" joining these events. Usually, they only talk about ideas, but do not execute them. The Startup is about execution.\n\n  \n**Co-working Spaces:** These are hubs for creative minds and entrepreneurs. I found co-working spaces to be great places to connect with potential co-founders, whether through casual conversations or organized events.   \nSearching for a co-founder has been a journey full of learning and unexpected connections. While I've yet to find the perfect match, these resources and strategies have expanded my network and enriched my entrepreneurial experience. Remember, every \"no\" or misfit brings you one step closer to your ideal co-founder.\n\nI had a chance to work with three very good co-founders (one is a great startupper and developer, and another two one former Google directors) and I've learned two simple things: you should agree on who is the CEO before starting work and have clear expectations about how many hours per week you are going to work (40 hours at least).   \nHappy hunting, fellow entrepreneurs!",

A lot of people from corporations need a better understanding of what's mean hard work. In terms of actual results, 3 co-founders were from my network. Yesterday, I had a chance to talk with a cool founder, and he advised sending the message to Reddit because he found his co-founder through the message. Probably I need added one more source)",

Before, I only read the articles but never created my own post or comments.\n2. When I'm asking, sometimes I have my own opinion and answer. For example, this post contains my experience and comments from real life, not theoretical books))) And I'm expecting to have a conversation with folks. I'm not expecting an exact answer.\n3. As for other questions on my account, here is part of my experience. Because I interviewed a lot of people and share insights that I got. Again, usually, I'm not expecting straightforward answers - instead,  I would like to have a discussion and conversation. \n4. And finally, as for search))) for sure it's easy to use the search and got outdated answers. But again, better to get real answers in the particular moment than to check the guts)))\n5. Thank you for checking my other questions, and probably you checked several releases of our prototypes. Don't hesitate to expect more)",

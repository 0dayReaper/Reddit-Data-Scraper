    "postText": "**Assumptions:**\n\nWith the avant of AI generative tools, individual content will become a commodity.   \nExamples are:\n\n* copy (from tools like ChatGPT, Bard, ChatSonic)\n* images (from tools like MidJourney, Leonardo, Adobe Firefly)\n* music (from tools like AIVA, Amper Music, Soundful)\n* videos (from tools like Descript, Wondershare Filmora, Runway)\n* image social media posts (from tools like MS Designer, Adobe Express, Canva)\n\nAs content generation becomes easier and easier, there will be an influx of content created by AI tools and they will raise the bar on content. As that happens, content pages will need something else to engage users.\n\nInteractive content could lead to increased engagement and lead generation, as it would distinguish itself from content pages with copy, images, animated GIFs, embedded Videos.\n\n\\---------\n\n**Business Idea**\n\n* Interactive Content Editor\n   * Create interactive content that you can embed into any webpage.\n   * Users can interact with the content via traditional mouse and scroll events, and mobile events like touch and tilt.\n* Target Audience\n   * Marketing firms, marketing department in companies, individual content freelancers wanting to compete with AI tools.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/148p0q3)",

It was a big lesson to both of us as business owners that no one knows what\u2019s in your head. We both had different expectations of what the finished product should look like. That experience has encouraged me to write down some SOPs for myself in case I ever hire anyone. The big lesson on writing SOPs is to write a process the way it\u2019s actually done, not how you want it to be. \n\nWhat kind of work do you do and what would you want a VA to do?",

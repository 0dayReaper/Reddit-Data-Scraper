People post the links for the discount, you just scroll through and enroll in the ones relevant to what you're interested in. I'm pivoting to web development and purchased 2 paid courses before I thought of this. Currently I'm up to 19 pages of courses. Not all web development either. Resume writing and time/stress management were good grabs, too.",

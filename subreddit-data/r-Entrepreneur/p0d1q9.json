But designer shirt is very vague in value (clothing, aesthetics, social clout, etc.) and can be priced much above the cost of materials.\n\nEDIT: Found a quote that captures it nicely: \"Don't sell what you can make, make what you can sell\" --of course exceptions apply.",

This is not some herculean, incomprehensible, irreplicable feat. I'm fact, there are several competitor companies already who would have eaten the same market space.\n\nFor Disney, Walt and his company arguably has set humanity back in terms of creative potential by advocating for and getting huge extentions to copyright protections. And again, there are a down competitors in their field who would have filled their gaps, maybe even more successfully without the monopolistic pressure and abuses perpetrated by Disney, past and present.\n\nEven if you believe in Great Men fallacy (which you shouldn't), the fact is that those great men are still completely dependent on the social structures built up around them and the toil of those under them, their decisions echo so loudly as they are amplified by the actual labor of others.\n\nAnd again, the contribution of a Bezos or a Walt may be very important but it wasn't their genius that made them billionaires.

Literally every MBA tier mumbojumbo analysis can be summed up as whoever has the most capital wins. Why did Walmart beat Kmart? Because Wallstreet gave them much more capital, which allowed them to sell things for a lot less than Kmart.\n\nWhy could Amazon lose money for 20 years? Because Wallstreet kept shoveling them capital to keep them afloat.\n\nWallstreet is just central planning with more steps involved. If you can tap into that Fed -&gt; Wallstreet capital pipeline, you can ignore common sense business strategies (like Kmart being concerned about making a profit) because they'll just keep shoveling you cash indefinitely until you're the market winner. It's not complicated.\n\nWe like to pretend these Great Leaders like Bill Gates created these giant companies because of their Great Vision. Bill Gate's parents were fucking bankers. We're told he had this startup in his garage or whatever...but the reality is Bill Gates was successful because he had institutional access to large amounts of capital. Normal plebians don't have that kind of access. Donald Trump \"small loan of 1 million dollar\"  vibes rn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGive a monkey 1B and they'll grow it into 4B over 10 years.

Apple floundered without Jobs, and thrived when he came back. You can give credit where it's due for vicious business instincts without celebrating who they are or even what they achieved. I don't think it's very likely that those companies would have succeeded to the same degree without the influence of those key people. They're the sort of folks that trade every second of the intimacy and pleasure in life that most other people yearn for in the sake of achievement. They're the ones that stay up till 4am every night even though their partner has been begging them to come to bed for years. Not everyone is like that. They may be psychopaths, but they're effective, and I think it's important to understand why. And Kardashian is a *serious* outlier, because she's in the highly unusual position of selling her own personal drama, sex appeal, and charisma, but let's not pretend any cute woman with a dramatic family is on TV telling their story.

The truth is that timing, luck and privilege play a much larger role than hard work. Do you think that a single mother who has to work 3 jobs to make ends meet doesn't work hard? But her hard work is probably never gonna get her to even middle class let alone to being one of the wealthiest people in the world.\n\nAlso I've worked closely with a lot of executives of big companies and I can tell you that while they do work hard they don't work as hard as you're suggesting. Their schedules are basically on par with any other professional but as you know not every professional is a billionaire by virtue of how hard they work. Because hard work =\\ blockbuster success. Tbf I do believe that Jeff Bezos is an extreme workaholic so he's kind of an exception. \n\nThe thing is that we always want to place the reason for successes in ourselves and the reasons for failures on outside causes. If you're an aspiring entrepreneur you want to believe if you just work hard you'll be super successful. But it's not that simple. \n\nYou're also confusing correlation and causation. The fact that Steve jobs returned and Apple's fortune turned around doesn't necessarily mean he caused that turnaround. It was actually the iMac and iPod that started Apple's turnaround and he wasn't there for a lot of that development and on top of that Microsoft was dealt a blow in the early 2000s due to losing their antitrust battle.",

You can have two identical groups of people led by two different people. One great leader and one less than great leader. The group with the great leader will perform better. Leadership and direction can make or break progress.\n\nThis is one of the reasons teachers are so important. Anyone can learn a topic. But the driving force for the value in that classroom is the teacher's ability to connect with and lead they students.\n\nEven take POTUS. How much work does the president actually do? They mainly connect people together and lead the work. If it didn't matter who was the leader then we wouldn't have debates over who is the president.",

As life span growth stutters and (in some populations) declines, as cost of housing and education and healthcare grows to higher and higher multiples of the average wage, as we see accelerated concentrations of wealth and the commensurate concentration of both political power and market clout (remember: companies only cater to you if you have money to spend)... how do we view our results?\n\nMany obvious solutions exist. Wealth taxes, broad based investments in human and physical infrastructure, support of civil and worker rights (including unionization)... but the aforementioned concentration of political power makes each battle more lopsided.",

Another massive e-commerce company (and likely another, separate, cloud computing company). If Amazon's profits were a bit lower because they treated their employees better, what would people's investment portfolios look like? Probably the same. Amazon would have somewhat lower profits and maybe some other company (Overstock, Target, Microsoft, etc...) would have higher profits. \n\nBezos isn't creating all the money out of thin air. Technology allowed for creation of new markets and thus new wealth and higher standard of living. Bezos utilized it really, really well, and he created *some* wealth being more efficient about it. However, the true driver of wealth (and thus the stock market) is technological advance. Don't thank Bezos for e-commerce, thank the pioneering computer scientists, aerospace engineers, etc... People are upset because they'd rather their 401ks and IRAs be filled with stocks of companies that treat their employees with more respect. \n\nHowever, there's not much you can do in this system. You have to invest your money if you ever want to retire, and you'd be a fool to invest it only in more ethical companies, because they can't compete with the unethical ones. So you can be upset that unethical companies exist and edge out would-be-profitable ethical companies while acknowledging that investing in the unethical companies is the only way to get by.",

I do appreciate it. \n\nWhile i do See your points and I do share them, it does Not address my actual point. You say that People who complain about Bezos use the 2 das shipping. And thats an ad hominem I dont share, because many people do not critizise Amazon at a whole but certain practices. Bezos is infamous for tough working conditions in the warehouse and thats something that absolutely needs to be addressed. \n\nIf my 2day Shipping is only possible because of certain Business practices than your point would stand. But thats very unrealistic, certain things can be addressed and changed without the Grand construct changing. Apple could avoid using the slave labor, Amazon can grant proper toilet breaks  and 2day Shipping would still be possible. Using a Service does Not mean that I cant critizise it, on the contrary, I WANT to use amazon but I dont want the workers get treated shitty.",

No one's arguing that he didn't make people money and take a fair cut based on the market, but it's not like he created all the wealth afforded to him by Amazon. Amazon utilizes many public resources, mostly (but not limited to) public generation and distribution of knowledge. He's standing on the shoulders of giants, and under capitalism all that matters is who owns the company using all of this information, technology, infrastructure, etc... \n\nHis true worth is the delta between what exists now and what would exist without him. Without him there would be another massive e-commerce company. Stands to reason he hasn't actually *created* $200B in wealth. He captured it from a market that was born from technological improvements. Under a system that acknowledged this \"delta,\" he'd be massively wealthy still, but far less so.\n\nI'm no anti-capitalist. It's the best system we've come up with so far, and if this is one of it's flaws... so be it. However, I think it's worth acknowledging that our system disproportionately rewards the owners of firms that utilize public resources to create a profit.\n\nThe answer isn't villainizing Bezos though. It's looking at our legislators and collectively saying, \"Guys, seriously? This is what we're incentivizing?\"",

In general, the higher the value proposition for a customer is, the more they are willing to pay. It's honestly not a bad \"Fast and loose\" cheat sheet for those who haven't thought too hard about the concept prior.\n\nObviously, if you are an old hand at the business world, you knew everything in this post instinctively and didn't really gain anything from it. For anyone who is \"less\" experienced though, it's not a bad crash course in an relevant concept.  \n\n\nIdeally, in an academic setting this would be followed up with an in-depth discussion, case examples, and the students would be given practical exercises to demonstrate mastery of the concept. Reddit isn't an academic setting. If you want to though, you could do further reading on your own, and think about how these concepts apply to your business.",

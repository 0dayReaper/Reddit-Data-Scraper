    "postText": "Recently, I ran a survey here calling founders doing B2B sales today with their businesses.  \n\n\n50% of them did not know what a discovery call/meeting was. Which basically is leaving money on the table.  \n\n\nNOTE: This is only relevant if you are doing B2B sales (SaaS or similar).  \n\n\nTo not make this post unbearably, I put together a [post](https://www.asqly.io/post/the-value-of-discovery-1o1) that hopefully can explain what [discovery](https://www.asqly.io/post/the-value-of-discovery-1o1) is and why it's crucial if you are doing B2B sales.  \n\n\nHope this can help founders out there to close more meetings!",

            "comment": "It's surprising to hear that 50% of founders in B2B sales are unaware of what a discovery call/meeting is. Discovery plays a crucial role in the sales process, enabling businesses to uncover their customers' pain points and tailor their solutions accordingly. It's definitely a missed opportunity for those who are unaware of its significance.",

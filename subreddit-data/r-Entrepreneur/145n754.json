Its just that for me the accountability of working with piers and the genuine drive to see the project succeed that comes with a founders team working with equal interest in the company is something that cant be bought with a paycheck and 0 equity. I'm not talking about a massive startup, their are many business' that can become profitable with 4 to 7 founders before hiring non-equity holding employees. and problem solving is on a different level when working with an equal interest team.",

Being part of a community would be cool, but I wouldn't support anyone else's business than my own. Eventually you are bunch of people talking about doing something, that in the end is an individual venture. Join them for inspiration and tips, but you need to be passionate about what you are actually doing. And I doubt a group of people will all have the exact same interests to enjoy it. I may be wrong mate, but just my take.",

Don't worry, it's not stuff everyone but you knows, which is one reason why businesses fail.\n\nYou might look at The Personal MBA or a similar book. Just something that goes over business foundations. If that doesn't seem like a good fit, maybe try learning about the main financial reports (income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet) and how to read them. If you Google each one you'll come up with a ton of results. Understanding them will give you a better grasp on how business financials work. A lot of the \"math\" of a business is just arithmetic. \n\nNeither of those recommendations are specifically about entrepreneurship, but honestly, neither are your questions. Just good ol' business concepts.\n\nFrom there, you can look for more specific resources on analyzing business opportunities. If you try to go straight into \"will this be profitable,\" you'll probably run into a lot of resources that assume you know those concepts already.",

My partner wants me to open us up to the US.  Ive been on the production side of things my whole life, so this is my first time in sales, but I really want to make the change.  ANYWAYS...\n\nBy distribution all setup, I mean that we have partnerships with importers/forwarders in the US that I can use.  The distribution is all setup in France, and we can apply that process to the US since everything is all good to go until the ports here in Asia anyways.  We have a network of 55 factories that can fill literally any order in our field, and since we work direct we almost always save money for customers.  \n\nSo I have no distributors working with me in the US yet.  My plan is to reach out to as many as possible first (\\~70%) but also go direct to potential end customers (\\~30%).  I just don't know how to reach them.",

I noticed to find the right people to grow with is very hard because they are already doing something. To synergies and band together would be amazing. I currently do business on both the east and west coast in the us. It would be nice to find like minded individuals who aren\u2019t in desperate need for cash because that distracts from being able to grow and in all honesty\u2026 if you dont have your financial situation straight and aren\u2019t fiscally responsible then you are not ready for this playing field. \n\nSorry for the rant. What slows progress is finding the right butts and putting them in the right seats. I have a large playbook ready to be implemented, i am taking my time and waiting for the right alignment. \n\n\nBtw i built mine with no debt, straight 5 years of living like shit and reinvesting. Now in a better place to grow even more \n\nAdvice to all, never make it about the money or else that consumes you. \n\n\nAlso im not very good at writing in the internet, im old-school i like face to face.",

    "postText": "Hello entrepreneurs,  \nAs a founder of an upcoming project, I'm excited to share my idea to address some of the significant pain points real estate agents face. My solution offers a platform for agents to advertise properties with a unique twist - a token reward system.  \nWe've heard numerous complaints about a need for more transparency in pricing, inflexible packages, and poor customer service in the current market offerings. Our mission is to resolve these issues and provide a service that is built on the following:  \n\t\u2022\tClear, transparent pricing: No hidden fees or unpleasant surprises.  \n\t\u2022\tPrompt customer service: Efficient support to resolve any issues or concerns.  \n\t\u2022\tAd tracking: Easy-to-use tools to manage and monitor your ads.  \n\t\u2022\tTechnological innovation: Using AI and other advanced features to streamline ad posting and management.  \nOur subscription service costs \u20ac49/month. Early adopters will be rewarded with tokens that have an actual monetary value. These tokens are funded by redistributing 20% of our net revenue back to these early subscribers. The distribution is as follows:  \n1. The first 50 subscribers get 200 tokens each.\n\n2. The next 50 subscribers get 100 tokens each.  \n3. Subscribers 101-150 get 50 tokens each.  \n4. Subscribers 151-200 get 25 tokens each.\n\n  \nAs our subscriber base grows, so does the value of these tokens. This way, our early subscribers can be a part of our success.  \nBefore we launch, I would appreciate your feedback on the following:  \nThe subscription pricing - does it seem fair?  \nThe token reward system - is it appealing?  \nThe features we are planning to offer - do you know if they address your needs?  \nDo you have any suggestions or comments that could help us improve our service?  \nThank you for taking the time to read and provide your valuable feedback. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!  \nBest,  \n",

                    "comment": "Hi, thanks for your comment. I understand the confusion, so let me clarify a few things. \n\nYes, real estate agents are the primary users of our platform. Our product is an ad-publishing platform specially tailored for real estate agents. It's designed to streamline their work and increase their visibility in the market.\n\nAs for the tokens, their purpose is to add an extra layer of engagement and benefit for our users. They are not cryptocurrency and are not designed with any MLM (multi-level marketing) model in mind. They are a type of reward or loyalty points system that we have created to incentivize our early users and create a sense of community.\n\n\nThe increase in value of the tokens is tied to the growth of our platform, reflecting the growing value of the community and services we offer.\n\nI hope this helps to clear things up! Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions.",

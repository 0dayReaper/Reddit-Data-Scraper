The second one reads better imo, but I wonder if, perhaps, it could also be viewed as arrogant and/or too cringey. And that perhaps the first one, though shorter and simpler, sounds more professional? \n\nFor context, this is for the final sentence in a paragraph on the \u201cAbout\u201d section of my business\u2019s website.",

This is super common in people who write copy who aren't copywriters. \n\nHonestly ask yourself, if someone reads \"Confidently serving clients across the globe.\u201d do you *actually* think they're going to give a shit?\n\nDo you really think that line of copy is so unique, so impactful that it's going to drive someone to engage with you?\n\nGood copy is specific, and it is benefit driven. \n\nSo for example, let's say you serve a client confidently, what do they get out of it?\n\nIncreased revenue? Bigger ROI? Reduction in cost of goods? Cheaper shipping rates? \n\nI don't know what your business is about, but I do know that if you speak about the benefits your business gives your customers, then you will have people reading your website that actually want to contact you.",

Started off super cheap, like $5 per hour\u2014 I was losing money but it built up my client portfolio. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been running my own thing for 3 years and will never look back! \n\nOh\u2014 I\u2019m a software developer.

They\u2019re talking absolute rubbish. I myself left university (after the second time I went, to do a Master\u2019s degree) and went straight into self-employment rather than get a job and become an employee working for someone else\u2019s business - I started my own.",

If you start a freelance UX design biz, any clients you get will become work experience which can help you get a job, and any jobs you get can become work experience which will help you get more freelance clients.  By starting a small business selling the skill that you are training to do professionally, you build this kind of awesome feedback loop that is:\n\nSkill Up =&gt; Faster, Better Quality Output =&gt; More Money Per Hour from Projects even if you charge the same, but you can gradually increase your prices too as you start to build up a backlog of demand =&gt; Faster / Better Skills =&gt; More Money =&gt; Jobs =&gt; Clients =&gt; Faster Better Stronger\n\nAs far as where to find those first clients, there are a lot of online marketplaces, but I found the most luck when I started my biz in local referral clubs -- they are groups of small bizes in the neighborhood that send each other leads when they get them, but UX design might be too specific to larger companies for that to be an interesting marketing avenue.",

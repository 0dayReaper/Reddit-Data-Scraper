    "postText": "I live in an area with a thriving small business scene, unfortunately some of those small businesses don't have the right \"vibe\" or aesthetic. For example, a delicious new Mexican restaurant opened recently and besides a few strands of papel picado, they don't have much decor. And their menu is just a printed word document. I feel that many of these small restaurants or shops could benefit from someone with vision pointing them in the right direction. As someone who has redecorated an apartment on a budget, I'd be very aware of what they can do with their resources. \n\nSo my question is, especially to restauranteurs and brick and mortar shop owners, is this something you'd be interested in? Is this a viable business idea? It wouldn't just be interior design, I'd help them find their voice, so to speak. I'd be a \"vibes\" consultant, in a way.",

Like that \"hidden\" restaurant that I used to go to, that didn't even have a sign out front, which was always packed.\n\nI had a similar conversation recently in this sub about websites and why so many businesses had crappy looking websites... some small business owners think having the perfect name and the perfect logo are the key; some think if they price high it'll make them look premium; some think if they perfect the product that the rest will take care of itself... none of them are necessarily wrong.\n\nThe reality is with branding you just don't know. You'll see it play-out long-term, but even then it'll be hard to measure how much impact something like nicer looking menus had over painting a big mural on the wall out front.\n\nBut really, it's not about producing results, it's about selling the idea that implementing a brand strategy will produce them.",

Get more people I'm the door to earn your fee.

Menu made in Microsoft word, awful lighting, vague music playing out of the kitchen not loud enough to really listen to but loud enough it\u2019s distracting, stacked boxes and supplies in view or in the dine-in area. It\u2019s unlikely people would pay more than $10 per meal to eat here, unless it\u2019s absolutely the best Mexican food in the area.\n\nNow picture turning it into more of a \u201cmodern cantina\u201d style for example. Blues, yellows and reds that pop. Multicolored metal chairs with butcher block or industrial tables. Vibrant colored accent lighting. Speakers in FOH with a good playlist. Big chalkboard with hired art. Now people will easily pay $16-$25 for an entree.\n\nI\u2019m not saying every business needs a strong brand, but there\u2019s obviously a business case for why branding increases revenue.

Helping retailers with the storefront look and signage, interior design, merchandising (shelving, lighting, clothing racks etc, or for restaurants their lighting, flooring, furniture, decor etc). \n\nI'd suggest do a couple retailers for free (clothing boutique and restaurant), take before-and-after pictures and use that to get new business.",

We almost cleared $1k and on top of that we got 200 people to follow our social by the end of the event. Since it was our first event it didn\u2019t go perfect and there\u2019s room for improvement for sure but every time I had a moment to look away from customers the other venders were kind of looking at us and I realized it was because their booths weren\u2019t busy.",

Once they like our Facebook they could play for a prize. People would walk by and see people playing so they would stop follow the QR code to our Facebook and play next. The prizes we gave away were our cheapest merch so they got a free taste of the merch and most of the time when they saw what it was they loved it and went to look at more merch. It was a hit. We also tried a kids activity which I thought would bring in a lot of people but it really didn\u2019t. It was our first market though and we wanted to see what would work.",

            "comment": "So, this is called \u201cbranding\u201d and it\u2019s a part of the marketing strategy. Branding and marketing can be tough to sell, given the difficulty of measuring ROI and the attitude a lot of small business owners have that, of course, their product/service is so unique and wonderful that word-of-mouth will suffice to bring in all of the sales they need.\n\nEventually, every business decides they need some sort of marketing. What\u2019s easiest is to bundle things that are easier to measure with things that aren\u2019t and price them as a package. For example, it is hard to quantify the value of new decor to a business owner but a redesigned menu, done properly, can show benefits quickly. The same goes for organic social media development as opposed to paid ads.\n\nFind the service that you can justify as having a more immediate payoff and bundle it with a thing that is important but more difficult to measure. Be up-front about explaining your pairing and do not be tempted not to charge for the labor/materials required for both. A good business owner will see the value in both and a someone who doesn\u2019t is not who you want to work for.\n\nLastly, keep in mind the truth I learned doing marketing for small-medium businesses. People running their business well only need a certain amount of your help. For people not running their business well, there is only so much help you can really give.",

They don\u2019t have decore because they don\u2019t make money. No amount of investment in decore is going to be too little for them at that stage. Taste/product matters more. People will tolerate a lot to taste good food. \n\nHow much you charge? I mean we\u2019ve established they don\u2019t have free cash flow, are small, have rocky future. No amount too small is too small for them. \n\nFlip it around, find established businesses with tired brands but great products, poor customer service, terrible decore but loads of desire to be better.

They are most likely thinking about concrete things like day-to-day running costs, staffing challenges, paying bills (utilities, rent, etc.), not about abstract things like decor, ambience, vibe, etc., so I believe it would be a hard sell. It's not because the services you describe don't have the potential to add value, it's because for the business owner to pay for, and believe, in said services, they would need to be quantifiable, and it would more than likely require a mindset and value shift on their part... and that is the hardest thing to sell, and even harder to help someone make, in any domain.",

            "comment": "The beauty of this sub is that everyone will spit ball ideas with you. You are kind of wording your original post like you think its a fresh idea for a service and its not. A lot of the feed back I think is overly simplistic in how to get started in that this is a sector and there is specific competition doing this all over the country so approaching it from a brain storming on branding I don't think will work really. That is good news for you because you will not have sell the concept to potential new customers they probably are getting approached. The other positive is that you picked something you have a real interest in. Me, I think those are to very strong points in your favor. New ideas are both very rare and very expensive to introduce.\n\nI think you will need to find a niche though and learn the ropes. As I said there are a lot of companies doing this and they specialize in sourcing the makeover materials and provide a detailed plan and budget probably in the form of a slick proposal. I am also fairly sure though that they market to the next tier of business than the new local restaurant you describe.\n\nTaking savings, hiring friends an family and opening on a shoestring budget is classic approach for the average Joe to get into the restaurant business. This usually means second hand restaurant equipment and decor and probably a few odds and ends from the owners house to plug a need. The mexician restaurant you describe sounds like it might fall under this description so maybe there is something there but you don't sound like you are ready to pitch anything yet.  Maybe approach them with an offer of a free service to get a start on a portfolio?  Every time you pitch one of these they are going to want references and b4 and after layouts of what you have done.\n\nYou could try to rack up some of these for a really cheap, free fee to build up a client base and experience to build your business foundation on.\n\nNot easy but doable, good luck!",

Often SMB entrepreneurs are good at the core operation, e.g. making delicious meals. However, they will often be less good at business in general, e.g., accounting, growth, and marketing. \n\nYou will soon realize that you need more than a good idea to get the job. You also need to sell yourself. u/BTCbob provides a great example of how you can approach this. Basically do this one for free, collect a great testimonial and look for the next paying customer. \n\nYou should also always keep your customer's viewpoint in mind, e.g. what's in it for them. Visualize how you can make them more money by getting more customers. Sell an outcome (more customers), not a product (branding). \n\nI'm rooting for you! Give us an update on how it goes.",

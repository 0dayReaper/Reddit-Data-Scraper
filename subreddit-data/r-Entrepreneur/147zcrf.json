    "postText": "The average millionaire often possesses multiple income streams, with many of them having seven or more. These income streams can vary depending on the individual's interests, skills, and investment strategies. Here are some common sources of income that millionaires may have:\n\n1. Business Ownership: Millionaires often own one or more businesses, which generate profits and provide a steady income stream. This could include operating a company in various industries or having multiple ventures.\n\n2. Investments: Millionaires frequently invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, or other financial instruments to generate passive income. They may earn dividends, interest, or capital gains from these investments.\n\n3. Real Estate: Many millionaires own rental properties, commercial buildings, or invest in real estate development. Rental income and property appreciation contribute to their income streams.\n\n4. Royalties and Intellectual Property: Some millionaires earn income from royalties or licensing fees for their intellectual property, such as books, music, patents, or trademarks.\n\n5. Stock Market Investments: Millionaires may actively trade stocks, options, or engage in other investment activities in the stock market, aiming to profit from market fluctuations.\n\n6. Passive Investments: They may have investments in mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other passive investment vehicles that provide regular income.\n\n7. Online Businesses: With the growth of the internet, millionaires often generate income from online businesses, such as e-commerce stores, affiliate marketing, or digital product sales.\n\n8. Consultancy or Freelancing: Some millionaires leverage their expertise by offering consultancy services or working as freelancers in their respective fields, earning income from client projects.\n\n9. Dividend Income: Investing in dividend-paying stocks allows millionaires to receive regular dividends, which can contribute significantly to their income.\n\n10. Side Businesses: In addition to their primary business, millionaires may have side businesses or ventures that provide supplemental income. This could include hobbies turned into profitable ventures or passion projects.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific income streams can vary greatly among millionaires, as each individual's financial situation and strategy may differ. The key is to diversify income sources to build wealth and mitigate risks.",

It\u2019s different streams of investment from real property or there are various types of investments in stock market vs. EFT which all have different sectors or industries.

    "postText": "Hey there!\n\nI'm an ordinary 15 year old boy. And my dream is to one day become a successful entrepreneur making millions of dollars a year. But I don't understand how to do it.\n\nI always see people my age starting their own businesses making lots of money, which makes me feel unproductive and worthless. I can't tell you how much I envy those people. I've surely watched over 500 videos on how to get rich. But they have either not worked or I have not even tried them. I think that's because I'm scared. Scared of failure and what others would say. \n\nI am hoping to receive guidance in some form or possibly a story of how you became a entrepreneur.",

The bigger the problem, or the number of people that it affects, the higher the reward.\n\nAnd are you really seeing lots of 15 year olds starting businesses making lots of money? Seems you are using too much social media.",

I can't really speak about anything online or tech because it's not really areas that I focus on in business. Long long long long ago I did have a lawn mowing service. \n\nI would look into some type of sweaty startup that fits in your area. Understand sometimes those things are seasonal but if you do a lot of research you might find ways to pivot and upsell.\n\nWhat you want to learn are the basics of business.\n\nSales, customer service, product-service fulfillment, invoicing, requesting referrals-marketing, money management.\n\nI'd also start listening to people that have built real businesses. I recommend Andy Frisella - search for the 300+ older episodes called MFCEO project. It's a more realistic hands on long road approach to building you as you build your business.\n\nI have listened to Jim Rohn since my early 20's. Good solid folksy wisdom on building YOUR personal discipline and value. At the end of the day the key to making money is you have to have enough value, then you bring the value to the marketplace, in the marketplace should reward you for the amount of value you are able to bring. It's a long road and anyone that says different or tries to tell you different is usually lying.\n\nI started in full commission sales in studying businesses with multiple attempts over the years when I was in my early twenties. I just turned 45 in May and I have a successful business that is taking me 7 years to get to this point. That's 7 years doesn't sound very long but really it's closer to 32 years when you add up all the years that I was learning and growing that led me to the moment where I could do what I've done. Even with all that behind me and finding the absolute perfect unicorn product in a massive reoccurring market it's still almost cost us our home three times.\n\nWhen you get a job look for something in sales. There is no greater or more important skill in any business than the ability to sell or persuasion.\n\nTry not to look at all the fancy videos and things like that online because it just discourages you. Understand that nobody in your life even those that you care about will support you because it's going to be a long journey before you start to see the results that make people go wow. You won't care about that result when you get there though.\n\n\nSo I would start working on building yourself over the years. (Jim Rohn, Les Brown) \n\nI would work on building your skill sets in business..... The best way to do this is go out and take action and study in your downtime. You don't need to buy any courses or spend any money because it's all online for free just be specific with your Google searches. Overtime you'll learn how to tease out what is real and what is not.\n\nAction! Pick something like mowing lawns and stick with it. Set a goal of say $1,000 that you want to earn. Then realistically break that down backwards and figure out what you would have to do daily/ weekly $, then go do those actions and in doing that you are building the skill sets that are applicable to any level of business from $1,000 business to $100 million dollar business.\n\nKeep us posted!",

I knew a lad your age who bought baby wipes in bulk and sold them online for more than he paid and then sold mattresses. He ended up making good money - sounds really boring to me but it\u2019s also simple economics. Don\u2019t listen to anyone who tells you \u2018no\u2019 in fact stop asking. You don\u2019t need a perfect start, imperfection is great. When I started on YouTube I was quite bad really but I was into it so it grew. No one cares as much as you think they do and stop imagining your failure before you\u2019ve even started. Imagine only success. Good luck. \ud83d\ude4f",

Those skills could be coding, data science, even a normal job like selling. It doesn\u2019t matter that much because you should definitely build a skill stack, meaning you are good in a few things.\n\nAnd I would also recommend to learn as much about marketing as possible. A good book to start would be \u201eThis is Marketing\u201c by Seth Godin.\n\nHowever, please stop only watching videos without ever taking action. First of all make sure to find out the good sources. Here is a tip to do that: Whenever someone makes something seem far too easy, it\u2019s probably bullshit. So the videos, books and courses that really matter are the informative ones. Make sure to always take notes and apply what you have learned.\n\nDon\u2019t stress out, enjoy your life and build the skills along with growing up.\n\nGood luck mate, you got this.",

But I don't understand how to do it.\n\nThe difference between millions a year and hundreds of thousands is not much - better vacations, a nicer house, a little more free time as more of your things are done for you.  But what is the difference between 4 bathrooms and one? You can only use one at a time and the bigger house needs more upkeep.\n\nMaybe shoot for a comfortable life and enough money to retire early.\n\nOne lower-risk way to get there is to go the traditional education/career route while having a side hustle. Eventually the hustle may grow to the point that you quit the day job - I did - twelve years ago now - and haven't looked back since. Or, perhaps, you don't, but you sock away an extra ?? 24K? 36K? a year after taxes. Get the house paid off in your 30's and retire early.\n\nJust a few thoughts. I'd think about the money last. Serve others, figure out what kind of life you want, then build systems to get it.\n\nGood luck. You're in a good place.",

A new dropshipping course, a new ai software you can use, need better SEO come to us!\n\nSlow and steady is how you become successful. You are 15, most kids your age are thinking about the next videogame they want not about business... so you already are a leg ahead of your peers. Don't fall for all the oversaturated nonsense you see on YouTube... dropshipping being the best example. 90% of dropshippers fail. It takes a lot of skill to make it actually work.\n\nBest advice would be to find a problem that doesn't have an answer and come up with a solution. Or find a market that doesn't have much competition in it. Whether it be something as simple as a dog walker, lawn mowing, social media management, videographer... find a way to be better at it than the competition. This could take months on its own. Planning for a buisness is not a 1 or 2 day job. \n\nBest of luck to you!",

Follow your passion, any business you want to start should most probably be in something people can\u2019t do or they don\u2019t want to do in the service world at least. So that were your passion comes in, noone can beat your hunger to the things that you really love and would like to do. For example me, I am at your age, I am fascinated by anything computer related, I build my own pc in 2021 with the intention of doing some video editing and 3d modeling in bender, as time passed I came by this course on my YouTube home page \u201cethical hacking in 12hr\u201d and that is when I really started dedicating all my will power into this which was about 8 months ago. Got to be honest I still know nothing about that topic but I know that this summer I am going to be dedicated every single hour of my life into this. Now you\u2019re asking, where is the money in this? As I stated before anything that people can\u2019t do they will most probably hire someone for. ETHICAL hacking is not a skill most people have it is not a very competitive market as far as i know but they is a very wide area for improvement in this industry. This applies to a lot of other industries, this whole thing was just an example of what i know about. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself with money unless your family is poor as hell and you really want to make a change, you should not keep it a first priority in life, I don\u2019t mean ignore this whole business world but don\u2019t overwhelm yourself with it. Lastly getting rich is a mindset and not a series of steps you can follow, you should work on developing your brain and understanding pf this world and i think that should be half of the equation to becoming rich and that\u2019s what I am basing this whole thing off of common sense I am not rich I don\u2019t have a business yet although I had a side hustle with my brother that got me and my older brother a decent amount of money back when I was 9 or 10 flipping parrots, basically slightly taming them and reselling them for double the price. It worked back then but not anymore now, people are a bit more educated and more cautious of putting their money to things like this these days",

You're in a place where everyone wants you to succeed and many have done what you want to do.\n\nSecond - Comparing yourself to others is a great road to misery and resentment. We can always compare ourselves to someone else. Prince Harry of England was arguably born the second most privileged person of his generation, and he's resentful he isn't first!\n\nIf you want to start a business, I suggest you find something distasteful others don't want to do that you don't mind. Or, alternatively, some way to add value. Here's an easy one: Go to the dollar store and get those sets of ten rings that glow in the dark for $1.00. Decorate a box, and on the 4th off July walk around selling them for a buck each. You can also do this with a cooler some ice and some frozen ice pops.\n\nOr knock on doors and offer to mow lawns.\n\ndo this until you master the craft and have customers, then hire someone else to do it.\n\nTrack your profit and loss.\n\nWhen you get to about $2,500 of profit projected in a calendar year, talk to your parents. After $3K you might need to think about taxes.\n\nBut the BASIC starting point is asking yourself: How can I be of SO MUCH SERVICE to people that they will THROW MONEY AT ME? Seriously. One way to do that is to work for free. Offer to mow lawns for free /if/ they provide gas and a mower (and a weedwacker maybe) say you would like them to be your referrals for other customers. This provides an /incentive/ for you to do a good job. They'll let you AND insist on giving you /something/ after.\n\nBe of service. the money will come.\n\nI hope that helps. Feel free to DM me.\n\nThere are other, more advanced ways to make money, like blogging and selling ads. First I would start a \"real\" business. Get your hands dirty. Do work.",

The vast majority of people shouting about their success have gone through dozens of failures. It has taken them a long time to become an overnight success. Also, there are a lot of \"successful entrepreneurs\" who are just outright liars setting you targets to follow that you can never reach.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if a video, post or book starts with them bragging about their success, they are more than likely a fake.\n\nThe other thing I would say is most success grows from small acorns.

I have heard being compared to cults on many occasions and that is not far from the truth.\n\nAs soon as I dropped all of that, my mental health went up, I had more time to spend on my business and things moved forward. The world did not end because I stopped listening to them.\n\nListen to specific advice about things like accounts and the physical running of your business by all means, but as soon as someone offers to \"empower\" you in some way, run away.",

You can buy books, or get them free from your library. \n\nThat this might be subtly increasing my anxiety and the gurus pitch themselves as the \"answer\" to relive it is interesting. Might be the best thing for me to is to back off. \n\nDo you follow Alex Hormozi? That guys content, in my assessment, seem to be mostly fancy ways of saying nothing much. It sounds insightful but there is little to grasp on to. Well, perhaps you get what you pay for.",

First, was the comparison problem which had me constantly asking what I was doing wrong and why I wasn't as successful. So, I would say they are adding a lot to peoples anxiety when there is no need.\n\nThe second issue was it had me taking business decisions I probably wouldn't have, if I wasn't listening to the \"gurus\". They had me trying to grow far too quickly without tackling the issues that come with scaling up. I was tackling too much and things that I wasn't ready to do (adding to the \"am I failure\" vibe).\n\nWhen I see videos from the likes of Hormozi (there are thosands like him) I immediately question what is their motivations for chasing likes on YouTube and TikTok. If they have a $200m business portfolio (like he claims) why are they spending so much time chasing cents on social media? Very few seem to be out to genuinely help others. In Hormozi's case, he seems to be promoting a range of products and books.\n\nThe alarm bells start to ring really loud when I see their content has very little sustenance and their video list is made of these types of articles.\n\n1. How to make $X million in a month/year\n2. 10 Tips that made me a Millionaire\n3. A day in a life (see my fancy hired jet)\n4. How everyone else keeps your poor\n\nThe first 3 types contain little more than sound bites with next to zero usable content. The net result is you end up beating yourself up over your inability to make those millions or to get that jet. The last article type is designed to stop you from looking elsewhere for advice (this is how cults work).\n\nThere are some exceptions of course. If your business is selling content like courses and similar content, Pat Flynn can be good. There is a lot of fluff on his channel but that is the nature of producing YouTube videos. During the lock-down he did daily 2-hour live Q&amp;A sessions answering some very specific questions on his area of expertise.",

You can see my comments here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffeezilla\\_gg/comments/svp2ej/alex\\_hormozi\\_ripoff\\_gymmarketing\\_guru\\_thoughts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/12i2hma/genuinely_curious_is_alex_hormozi_legit_or/)\n\nI'll drop my longest/most detailed comment here to. I did get the dollar amount wrong I looked it up on the iced coffee hour and he says he has something like $30 Million liquid. I'm afraid I can't remember the exact amount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That's a detailed analysis of his start. Where did you get that intel? In his $1 book and videos, he just implies he \"built six gyms\" and sold them for very little, then he had just one and his partner stole from him so he started gym launch.It all reminds me of a a quote I heard yesterday:\"Cons work because people want something for nothing.What con men actually do, however, is provide nothing for something.\"Consider those words and watch a couple hours of Alex Hormozi Material. What is he offering? Why? Who benefits? I've listened to multiple \"how I made my first million\" videos by alex and this seems understandable. WORSE, his story is \"I kept failing upward, losing money, (implied: YOU SHOULD TOO) until I found my magic formula.\"One could argue he is not a criminal, and only criminals deserve the title of \"con man.\" Okay. That's maybe fair. It looks to me like he's committing misrepresentation, but it isn't of the product, is it of the Hormozi \"brand.\" It is legal to lie. So, on the iced coffee hour podcast, when he said he was \"about $160 million\" liquid, he could explain that away a zillion ways -- he also says he doesn't look at the bank statements, his wife does. So later he could say \"oh, whoops, yeah I meant 16 million\", or \"i don't know where I got that number from, like I said, my wife does the books.\" Even if he had said it in court under oath, it would be hard to make a perjury charge stick.And that's the point. All of the things he says are carefully worded so he can get out of them. To borrow a line from the west wing \"He did exactly the kind of thing (a smart person) would do whose intention is to perpetrate a fraud.\"I don't think Alex can be charged with anything legally. In that sense, he is not a \"con man.\" What he does is more like selling ice cubes to eskimos, as the say goes: His model seems to be to provide something that /could/ work, maybe, at an extensive premium. This is different than the model I have for the modern professional (think Doctor): to provide something of value to society and be provided a (perhaps very) comfortable living by it.UPDATE: You want to change my mind? Show me happy customers with an improved condition. Why doesn't he have them on his podcasts and videos? He's made bazillions so there must be a bunch of them ... right?",

    "postText": "The first cohort of my course is about to start on Tuesday. I've spent about $5K and made about $5K (4 enrollments). Which means if we move forward, I won't be able to pay myself or the other instructor anything. \n\nI think there are two paths:\n\nIf I don't believe this can be a big thing someday, I can cancel the course, apologize to the students, and give back the tuition. Failure will hurt but maybe save me time in the long run.\n\nOr I can see it through, spend 50+ hours teaching the course over the next 10 weeks. And maybe sink more money into more ads for a second cohort, and hope the second cohort gets more enrollments.\n\nThoughts?\n\n \n\nmore info: \n\nI'm fairly good at ads, so I ran some facebook ads and reddit ads, spent $5K of my own money. It worked but the conversion rate was much lower than I expected. One hypothesis is we're just getting started, another hypothesis is that the course just isn't at P-M fit, or that the market is too saturated.   \n\n\nAlternative:  \nI work as a growth / marketing consultant for startups. I charge about $275/hour and I currently have 2-3 clients so I'm making pretty great money already. I really want to be an entrepreneur and so I decided to launch a course on growth marketing ([https://try.skillupgrade.org/growth-marketing-bootcamp/](https://try.skillupgrade.org/growth-marketing-bootcamp/)) \n\nIf we're not at P-M fit, I could cancel the course and try a different course concept. All the infrastructure is built now.",

Nothing works straight out of the gate either. The fact you will break even is an amazing start. I'm out of pocket with 100% of my idea when starting",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve been running a cohort course on Maven for the last two years. Just finished my 12th cohort. I had 325 students so far (last cohort 52) at about $1000 per student without spending anything on ads (except one paid newsletter test). \n\nHow did I do it?\n\nBy having a system of marketing tactics at every stage of the marketing funnel. \n\nI build my audience by giving away valuable content for free via posting on LinkedIn, that\u2019s my top of the funnel. \n\nThen I point them to my weekly newsletter via lead magnets or plugs at the end of my social posts. \n\nAfter nurturing the leads for some time with weekly emails, I convert them to students via webinars and a 9-day email sequence. \n\nLong story short: \n\nInvest time into audience building instead of money into ads. Not only is your profitability higher, you also sharpen your thinking by sharing what you learned. \n\nAnd there is no better way to position yourself as a subject matter expert than by giving lots of valuable info away for free. \n\nOh and also, I\u2019m surprised you are teaching 50 hours over ten weeks. My course is 10 hours over two weeks. People are paying for the value they are getting, not for the time they spend learning. \n\nDM me if you are interested to learn more. I\u2019m now coaching other cohort course instructors on how to set up their marketing systems and get more students without paying for ads.",

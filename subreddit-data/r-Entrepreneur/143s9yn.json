    "postText": "\n study synopsis: https://www.psypost.org/2023/06/new-psychology-research-pinpoints-personality-factors-related-to-wealth-accumulation-164440\n\nCliff notes for the most influential of the big 5 traits:\n\n\n\"Conscientiousness appears to play a crucial role in money management and wealth accumulation, according to new psychology research published in Financial Planning Review. The findings provide evidence that individuals who are more diligent, organized, and hardworking tend to have higher levels of wealth, even after accounting for education and other factors.\"\n\nOn the other hand, neuroticism was negatively related to wealth, suggesting that individuals with higher levels of emotional volatility and anxiety tended to have lower levels of wealth. The data also suggested that neuroticism was negatively associated with work success, a major source of income. The unstable nature of neurotic individuals may hinder their ability to manage wealth effectively.\n\nThe study also found that extraversion had a modest but significant correlation with income. However, when it came to wealth, extraversion showed a modest but significant inverse relationship with savings and investments, but a positive relationship with wealth held in physical items. This finding suggests that extraverts may be more impulsive in their spending and make poor investment decisions.\"\n\n*Glossary- what does conscientiousness mean in psychology?\n\n\"Conscientiousness\u00a0is the\u00a0personality trait\u00a0of being\u00a0careful, or\u00a0diligent. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be\u00a0efficient\u00a0and organized as opposed to\u00a0easy-going\u00a0and\u00a0disorderly.\"\n\nWhat is neuroticism? \n\n \"individuals with high scores for neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as\u00a0anxiety,\u00a0worry,\u00a0fear,\u00a0anger,\u00a0frustration,\u00a0envy,\u00a0jealousy,\u00a0pessimism,\u00a0guilt,\u00a0depressed mood, and\u00a0loneliness\"*",

I\u2019ve accidentally found myself holding down the entire market in the area. THE PHONE DOES NOT STOP RINGING. With two employees, we\u2019ve accidentally smashed last year profits in the last two months. P&amp;l statements are extremely solid. Everything is legit. Books are clean, there\u2019s money in the bank account. Looking to expand. What the next step?????",

He now enjoys the benefit of seeing his progeny live comfortably. The envious will always be there to tear you down. If their words are not constructive and actionable, move on.\n\n\nNow as to your actual question. Sounds to me like you need to hire more people. What's your existing team like? Are they leadership material? Work on turning them into people you can trust to work without you present and then giving them each a team to manage.\n\n\nWhen scaling, the goal is removing yourself from day to day labor and to focus on building accounts, relationships, and maintaining.\n\n\nGet the phone work and booking done by an admin assistant. Get an accountant/bookkeeper.\n\n\nDon't do it all at once, watch your cash flow and do it organically.",

Decide on your own whether or not you can handle the Worst Case Scenario.\n\n\nWill the laborers be available when you need them if it's seasonal, or will seasonal visas throw a wrench into that plan?\n\n\nWill bringing in a clique make any other laborers excluded? What happens if you have to discipline one? Will the others back him despite (assuming you're justified here) wrongdoing on their friends part? You don't want a job to be held hostage because the whole team wants to back their man because they're friends.\n\n\nIf you're building a company and expanding the team you're going to develop a company culture and that culture is curated by it's members. I love the idea of a team of friends working together (you don't have to stress about compatability) too though. Importing labor may also not be as expensive as local laborers.\n\n\nWhat legal and tax ramifications surrounding work visas exist? Any regulatory/compliance requirements?\n\n\nWhat's the timetable for importing the labor versus local labor? Heck, do you have enough work to do both?\n\n\nSome questions for you to chew on.",

Just gotta find where that comfort point is.\n\n\nI can't say I know much about asphalt, so if you have recurring customers of any kind I imagine they won't take to it too well, but those new ones?

Year over year adjustments.\n\n\nI'm in a completely different field but the principle is the same across most industries. Your teams wages go up annually, your prices need to match that. A customer account should never go DOWN in profitability in most situations. \n\n\nThe price for new clients is whatever I wish I could charge the old ones but won't. Old clients will fight me on rates, new ones will take it or leave it. In both of our cases we have more work than we can fulfill so it doesn't bother us if prospects don't become clients. We move on.\n\n\nYes, track that return customer data. In particular, identify what industries or customer types are both most commonly the ones that come back to you and what their profitability is. For me, that subsection is construction, professional white collar services, and e-commerce. So now I specifically advertise at those industries because they're my favorite clients.",

Still, due to lack of experience, I\u2019m filling out entry level applications for labor jobs like this hour by hour day by day losing hope.

The phone will slow down and you make more money (or the same) with slightly fewer clients. \nAs mentioned do not overcommit. A couple bad jobs will also make the phone stop ringing. \nAsk the employees for references for people looking to work. Pay better than everyone and give them a reason to work for you. \nExpansion comes after you find your footing and get a sense of the business and where expansion and spending money will provide concrete results. \nGood luck.",

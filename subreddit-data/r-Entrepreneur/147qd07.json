They all had a dream, but couldn\u2019t accept why it never happened. From shit work ethic, to shady business, to being a personal doormat to everyone that looked at them. \n\nThe successful people I\u2019ve met tell a different story. They all have many things in common with each other but one stands out more than all the rest in each- their work ethic. They amaze everyone they speak with by how hard they work. Through failures, through wins, through mistakes, through it all. They work. And they hold themselves responsible to do so. They don\u2019t pass that on to anyone else. \n\nThat\u2019s what I choose daily to mold my life after because that\u2019s what eyes have shown me; the universe rewards people with many different things when they hold themselves accountable and refuse to give up.",

There\u2019s still PLENTY of experiences and knowledge I don\u2019t have of course, but that being said, I know that it\u2019s up to me to swallow that pain and keep going. The unsuccessful people I mentioned took their last kick and still to this day, blame the kick for (still) being unsuccessful.   Empathy is something i mold my life around daily due to being shown none over the years. Someone has to teach the kids right? \n\nEveryone has their own story with their own situations, yes. What sets us all apart is our takeaway from them and our actions afterwards. My personal experience has shown me that the \u201cgive up\u201d mentality in work/ success pushing is quite literally the only true roadblock to success. \n\nWhile that\u2019s my personal experience, I\u2019m young and open minded. I honestly hope that life will go on to show me every different situation so I can have a multitude of different perspectives and maybe benefit the world in some way big. \n\nMy original comment wasn\u2019t meant to hold any negativity and if that\u2019s the result it had I apologize! It saddens me to see ANYONE get kicked so hard/ so often that they just give up.",

I think we\u2019re talking about different types of people here as the people you\u2019re explaining still find success. I\u2019m not equating success with financial freedom here. If the goal is to be comfortable staying home more with family (as used as your previous example), then the amount of time spent at home is the how you\u2019d measure the success I\u2019m sure. And that can only be determined by the individual terms. Regardless, there\u2019s success there to be had, with a path to get there. \n\nMy experience covers people who walked different failing paths and quit. They live well under their capabilities with nothing other than bitterness in the world around them and no intentions of going anywhere else. Their mindset is \u201cI worked and working didn\u2019t work so I\u2019m done\u201d. \n\nThe love filled, happy with life janitor is just as successful as the multimillionaire business owner and the world seems to forget that.

    "postText": "\n#Before &amp; After \n\nDuring the start of social media, algorithms curated posted content based on recency &amp; opt-in basis. Only showing curated content from your following. \n\nAfter that, platforms started tracking user behavior to grow Advertising business and recommend content. \n\nToday, instead of content systems. We have generative AI taking the role of recommending content based on consistent user input on the app. \n\n\n#Write-path Classifiers (IG, TikTok &amp; Twitter)\n\nThis machine learning algorithm has the job to analyze your content at the time of posting. And it analyzes + compares your content to old &amp; trending content. \n\nActing as a moderator + these social media apps have human moderators too. (Often not get paid well)\n\nThis algorithm has few content filters like photo-recognition, Captions analyser &amp; relevancy checker. On that basis the content is pushed further to your audience. \n\nFor Businesses: This means that studying what existing content performs well &amp; embedding the performing elements into your content strategy is the key. \n\n#Read-Path Models \n\nThis is the next algorithm that uses engagement factors to push your content further to more audiences. And on instagram + Tiktok, this algorithm pushes the content to \u201cexplore\u201d &amp; \u201cFor You\u201d feeds. \n\nMaking the importance of getting engagement higher than before. Different engagement factors like likes, comments &amp; shares account for a different set of points making the algorithm push your content further to newer audiences. \n\nOn Instagram &amp; LinkedIn, your network of followers matters more than getting more engagement. Because who engages with your content pushes your content to a similar persona. \n\nWhich is why I recommend people not use your family &amp; friends as engagement boosters. They are interacting with your content &amp; then a 99% different topic the next moment. \n\n\n#Generative AI (Meta &amp; LinkedIn)\n\nIn the recent announcements, Meta &amp; LinkedIn shared they have doubled the use of AI to recommend people relevant. They claim that the new algorithm is making users stay for longer times. But many users are having different experiences, they are less content from people they follow. And getting more new content recommendations. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve observed tracking different influencer engagements is that they are also reaching more new audiences. While many of their core followers are failing to see their content on social media feeds. \n\nThat is why owning your audience &amp; building private brand communities is becoming a popular trend. And creators are also launching new discord channels to connect with their followers on a higher level. \n\n\n#My Strategies for Algorithm Beating Content \n\n\n\nFrom these learnings, I have built a strategy called \u201cTake one out\u201d. \n\n##Take one out \n\nFirst, You do social listening to learn what type of content is making a spark in your industry. Try to make a list of competitors and pieces of relevant content. \n \nSecond, Try to find the common structure or frameworks being utilized in those selective posts. For Example, It could be an Instagram aesthetic, Twitter Thread Hook, or LinkedIn Topic. \n \nPick that one element and add it to your original piece of content. And this is not a trend. This is a strategy to integrate working elements of another piece of content. To increase the possibilities of your content discovery on social media. \n\n\n##Revival Bubble \n\nDuring the Read-path models algorithm breakdown, we learned that your network can make or break your account. That is why from the start try to build relationships with industry businesses and creators. \n \nGet that targeted engagement from the start to reach the most valuable audience faster. I know this is hard to implement because you might have an old social media handle. \n \nIt is a little late, but not too late. Try to refine your network and create a new bubble to revive your organic growth.\n\n##CTAs, CTAs &amp; CTAs\n\nI know there are well-known theories on Tiktok and Instagram that calling out \u201clink in my bio\u201d is social media sin. The algorithm will never forgive you if you say that! \n \nNo, it is not the algorithm. It is most of the time Human Psychology. \n \nFirst, many types of research suggest that people treat each other differently on social media. And this also differs from platform to platform. The more anonymous people can be on social media, the more different they treat each other. \n \nSecond, We all don\u2019t like to take orders from anyone. Using a simple CTA like buy my stuff \u201clink in the bio\u201d sounds harsh to many followers. They don\u2019t express that feeling but ignore the content. \n \nThat is why always have Indirect Call-to-actions and be creative with how you represent what you sell or want them to do. \n\n\n**I hope this helps.

Similar to people making the buying decision faster when asked to buy sparking or still water versus when you directly ask them to buy water. \n\nInstagram changed their dashboard to show non-followers vs follower. Previously it was only impressions, this small change at Meta teams they were talking how impactful it were to encourage users to post more. \n\nWhich is why These platforms can change how you see the data. You have to rethink your own strategies before getting controlled by them.",

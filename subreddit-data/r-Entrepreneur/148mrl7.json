    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am not sure if this is the right place to post, but I am looking for 1-2 companies to work with (preferably SaaS, as that is the field I hope to focus my niche in) to provide real case studies to my portfolio.\n\nI am a marketer looking to switch to marketing design. I worked in advertising for ~ 3 years as a graphic designer, 4 years as a marketer and one year as a sales engineer.\n\nSince I've been in marketing/sales for the last few years, my last relevant designs were from 2016, so I am looking for a refresher. However, my marketing skills will add value to my work since I know what KPIs and business goals to design for.\n\nI believe that my skills will add value to your business.\nThis includes designing for:\n\n- Advertisements (Social Media, Display, Programmatic)\n- Landing Pages\n- Platform design (UI/UX Design)\n- Marketing collateral\n- Brand Guidelines\n\nWhat I do NOT do:\n\n- Copywriting\n- Engineering or Web Development\n- Logo Design\n\nI am able to work for up to 40 hours of work for free - beyond that; I am looking to charge a discounted rate. (This is non-negotiable).\n\nIf you are interested, please message me the following details:\n\nWhat is your business?\nWhat offering does your business provide (product or service)?\nWhat problems are you looking to solve for your business?\nWho are your biggest competitors?\nHow can I help with your business?\nIs there any specific marketing collateral you need?\n\nPM me if you have any questions! :)",

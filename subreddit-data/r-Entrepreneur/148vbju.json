I'm 5-months through another online course ($3500) hoping THIS ONE would finally be the one that helps me crack the code to making a full-time living online.  \n\n\nI've done everything asked of me, my mindset, work ethic and motivition have been solid.... but when I look around at the alumni in the group NOBODY has actually made a profit, NOBODY has reported any kind of meaningful success. (atleast  not the kind of success we were sold on)   \n\n\nI can't help but think I've been suckered into another workshop with an outdated and ineffective business model. The course I am referring to is one of **Aidan Booths. I wouldn't touch them FYI**. Might of worked in 2010 but total waste of money these days as he's just reselling the same obsolete crap that worked well for affiliate marketers a decade ago!  \n\n\n**But enlighten me, what online business models have proven to be a success in 2023? Is there a course or training that folks are recommeneding? I'm not giving up on this dream!**",

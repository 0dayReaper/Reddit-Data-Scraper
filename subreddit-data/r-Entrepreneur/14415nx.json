They may have some ideas at work, but because of bureaucracy it is not doable.\n\nThe other opportunity comes from changes in regulation, for example:\n\n* When plastic bag was no longer allowed, then shopping bag business thrived\n* When work in office was not allowed, video conferencing service thrived\n* When theatres were closed, then pay to watch service thrived\n\nThose will open opportunities for entrepreneur to jump in.",

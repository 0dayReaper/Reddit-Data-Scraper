    "postText": "Basically i made a tiktok @riodot4 \n\nand in about 5 days, i have done pretty well ( around 450 followers so far) My plan is once i get 1000 followers i am going to put the link in my bio to my course on how to grow your tiktok account. My only concern is that most people watching my videos are kids. And i am very doubtful that my course will consistently be selling. Do you think i need to switch up the game-plan or just test it out. I know sales are going to be slow at first but I\u2019m extremely confident that i can genuinely get this account to 10k followers within the next 2 months. What do you think i should do or sell?",

The pyramid crap is just widely used and defended. \nI\u2019d focus on growth first if I were in your shoes. Make sure you\u2019re marketing to your target audience so the growth you get is focused towards your message and not just because of the platform. Absolutely build your course and have that ready, but I wouldn\u2019t advertise it until you get a bit bigger.",

For example drive grandfather to doctor, make shopping, cleaning and other stuff like that?\n\nDo you hire some assistant for full-time?\n\nWhat's the state when you are able to afford that? What MRR?\n\nI set my aspirational hourly rate around $1000 and I know it's worth to work on my business rather than make this small tasks but I don't earn that much.\n\nWhat to do?",

Lots of cleaners available and pretty inexpensive.\n\nJust start knocking stuff off the list.\n\nBut do the same in your business.\n\nThe point is to have flexible time, not just so you can work all the time.",

We all have a job to work, we all have family to take care of, we all have chores and duties to do. Just because you have your own business, doesn't make you special. \n\nTime management is key for everyone, and you just need to figure it out. If your business can't stay afloat for a couple hours while you drive your grandfather to the doctors, you need to re-evaluate some things. You need to figure out what your priority is. You can put whatever dollar amount you want to on \"your times worth\", but in reality, that is useless. No one will pay you that much and no one else thinks you are worth that much. It is totally your own idea. \n\nSo to answer your question, to free up your time is wholly on you to determine what you want to do with your time, just like everyone else. Almost nothing is ever so critical it needs to happen instantly all the time. Set realistic goals and timelines and determine what your time is worth doing, not how much your time is worth.",

So I know what I\u2019m cooking for the week, just need to add it to my online shopping order and pick it up/have it delivered. If you don\u2019t have pick up/delivery, then do it outside of normal work hours. \n\nFor cleaning, create a list of what needs to be cleaned every week and delegate it. Everyone can do 30 min a week of cleaning so it does not all fall on you. Once you\u2019re ready to outsource, you can. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re business is online or not, but you need to show you\u2019re working on your business. Most of the time if family just sees us sitting at our computer quietly, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s ok to bother us. Do some work out of the house or get on some zoom meetings, even if it\u2019s joining trainings.",

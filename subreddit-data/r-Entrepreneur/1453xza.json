    "postText": "A little context, I am a passionate entrepreneur that co-founded Daring Creators, a business having the mission to celebrate entrepreneurs' financial achievements, through art for now.\nMy vision is to design the \u201cYouTube play button\u201d of entrepreneurs, for those reaching financial milestones in their wealth or business. \n\nUntil now my main focus has been in refining the product to a maximum, but today the bottleneck is marketing, and would love your advice. (having made only 2 sales from an entrepreneurs meet-up)\nMy affiliate marketing strategy is to find video content creators in business/investment topics, and partner with them to create content and split monthly revenue.\n\n1- Do you know anyone that would be a good candidate for this partnership?\n\n2- You are very welcome to give suggestions on improving the product or changing it completely if you are the target audience but wouldn\u2019t buy. Initially I focused on art because I love it, but I am open to adapt and create another product type if it better serves the mission of celebrating entrepreneurs\u2019 financial achievements.\n\n(I didn\u2019t put the direct link because It\u2019s not an ad and I don\u2019t want to be taken down)\n\nThank you :)",

But I'm launching a community next week aimed at gathering people with all different skills with the goal of helping bridge skill gaps of individual entrepreneurs in the community. I already have someone in mind that could help you out with video production.\n\nWe need someone who is skilled at product design, like yourself! If you're interested in connecting, shoot me a DM or connect with Embark through the link in my bio.",

    "postText": "I have an established business in Europe, but due to certain reasons will be moving to Canada in the near future. Since I have connections there, I was thinking of expanding said business to NA, starting with Canada, especially since looking at the specific industry in North America we can be very competitive with our pricing. I was wondering if anybody has any experience with this type of situation? Maybe even started in America and expanded to Europe? Was wondering about cultural differences, specifically sales side. Since the business is B2B, here in Europe most sales are made either by word of mouth or cold calls. I feel like I am entering uncharted territory and wanted to seek some advice about folks who have been in a similar situation. Thanks!",

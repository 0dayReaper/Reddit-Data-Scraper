    "postText": "At least where i live. I live in a very small country which has a pretty strict culture. People won't make their feet wet with startup, but if they do so it's mostly in banking or sellind hardware. I am building a platform since a few time and always worked with an agency, which is expensive and sometimes tricky because they of course don't share the same spirit. Thats why i would really like to have a businesspartner who has knowledge about the technical part and would like to bring this to a launch with me. Someone who i can exchange ideas and visions with and grow together personally and financially. I've come far with the agency but i am in need for this personal exchange and connection to a real businesspartner.\n\nWhere the heck do i make these connections outside my country?",

Their goal is not to help you ship your product but to find more clients and that's what they will have their focus on most of the time. \nCan't say anything more, I am building my services with the skills I got and when there is something I struggle with I \"hire\" people from fiverr or try to learn it by myself. Despite that I've also met some people on Discord servers related to the topic, but most of them were lazy af and it never worked out.",

I am only a backend developer specialized in a cybersecurity, so when I need a frontend for my service I need to find someone who can actually do it good and fast. Once I've waited almost 3/4 days only to hear \"I haven't started yet\"... Friends and family are a great source of associates, but if not avaliable I would look for young passionates with lots of free time and no gaming addictions.",

It took so long because i am not the only client (describes my problem) and the war was bit of a pain. \n\nIt is sort of a monetizing platform with features that solve 90% of the problem users and creator have with ordinary platforms. So, a lot of features to program which takes time, i understand that. But now i am in a stage where i only need some additional features and a nice design. All the hard parts like payment processing, verification, law themed problems etc. are done. I could launch it by now but the spice isn't there without these features. My problem is mostly the backend stuff. I have no problem with hire an UI/UX designer to add the visual representation.\nNote: This is not one of those wannabe \"i take over the branche\" platforms. It's a serious thing with a bunch of people filling that market but not so much solutions available yet. There is competition, but in a way that third party platforms can profit from. \n\nI have literally no one around me who is even a little bit in that field. And it is very hard to even find these people in this country. Guess i need to look international...\n\nI feel your point with the waiting time sooo much. Thats not useful when you want to go on. But even more dramatic would a young passionate be, who turns out as a time waste. Hard to filter, harder to find",

            "comment": "Dude, I get it. Finding partners can be a real pain, especially in a small country with a strict culture. It seems like most people there are too scared to dip their toes in the startup world, except for the banking and hardware folks. But hey, don't lose hope! There's a big world out there with plenty of potential business partners.\r  \n\rFirst things first, broaden your horizons and look beyond the borders of your country. Thanks to the wonders of technology, you can connect with people from all over the globe. Start by exploring online platforms and communities where entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts hang out. Places like startup forums, social media groups, and industry-specific websites can be goldmines for finding like-minded individuals.\r  \n\rConsider attending international startup events, conferences, or meetups. These gatherings are a hotbed for networking and meeting people who share your passion for entrepreneurship. You never know, you might stumble upon that perfect business partner while enjoying a cold one at the after-party.\r  \n\rAnother trick is to leverage your existing connections. Talk to your friends, colleagues, or even your agency contacts. They might know someone or have connections in other countries who could be a good fit for your venture. Personal referrals can be a game-changer when it comes to finding reliable business partners.\r  \n\rOh, and don't forget about the power of social media. Use platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or even Reddit to reach out to potential partners and showcase what you're working on. You'll be surprised at how many people are itching to collaborate and join forces on exciting projects.\r  \n\rSo, my advice is to cast a wide net, be proactive, and think globally. The world is your oyster, man! Don't limit yourself to your country's boundaries. Take advantage of online communities, attend international events, and tap into your existing network. With a little bit of hustle and some good old-fashioned luck, you'll find that business partner who's ready to rock and roll with you. Best of luck on your search, my friend!",

We'd all be homeless by know if we got involved with all these people wanting free work.\n\nEven if it's just to cover costs you have to pay, and have them fly in to spent at least up to a month with you to see if it's a good match. Make plans with easy to check off milestones, that you both agree on are reasonable, to make sure the work progresses.",

The pay part wouldn't be the biggest problem, i funded everything myself up to this day.

I would recommend hiring someone who can do what you are looking for until you magically find your missing half (partially joking haha) \n\nTo find someone i would wait for posts about people with the same issue as you, looking for a partner. Or talk to as many people in the field you are looking for as possible. Direct message them, be friendly. They can either be a potential partner or a potential employee but either way it is great to build that network up. In a years time you can be friends with 20 people that are in the same field and that itself is powerful",

Ive messaged a few people here and ive tried the bumble bizz app but it wasnt too good. Facebook groups are good too. I mostly network in person because im in the construction industry mostly. I will say once you connect with one good person, their network becomes yours as well and vice versa. Just make sure you have some value to add to someone",

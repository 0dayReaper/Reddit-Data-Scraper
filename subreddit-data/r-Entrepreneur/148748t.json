    "postText": "I'm already looking into contacting a corporate lawyer who has experience in M&amp;A + legal entity structure. I figured I could use some outside perspective from reddit.\n\n**Context:**\n\nCompany A: Established in 2013, \\~15million ARR, 12.5% net margin, 14 FTEs plus owner.\n\nCompany B: Started in 2020 but but established in 2022, \\~400k ARR, all profits were reinvested to purchase equipment for the business, 2 FTEs, I haven't given myself a salary either.\n\n**Info:**\n\nMy partner operates Company \"A\" in LA. I operate company \"B\" in Chicago. These are 2 different entities but have the same name. **Almost 85% of revenue comes from my partner.** Initially, he approached me wanting to create a bigger image for his company-- \"my clients want to contract with a company who has multiple locations in the U.S.\". \n\nHe wants to retire within the next 3-4 years. His sons do not want to take over. The only reason I started this business was because we talked about merging together.  My initial thoughts were if this venture doesn't work out at least I can still focus on growing this business without him. Fast forward 3 years later to today, he wants to reimburse 100% of my investments and merge together.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHe specifically asked me to handle the legal structure of the business and how we should determine the ownership percentage. I want to come up with a fair evaluation...but how? Most people would calculate EBITDA and multiply by 3-5x depending on industry standards. Issue is... both of our bookkeeping records are not \"accurate\" and I'm technically operating at a loss.\n\nBesides splitting ownership, I also have some concerns about:\n\n1. How will new investment contributions change our percentage?\n2. Selling/Exit Protocol? How do we handle buying out shares?\n3. Profit sharing vs reinvestments?\n4. Accepting new investors\n5. dealing with losses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand there is a big difference between our evaluations. My goal is to learn as much as I can and hopefully buy him out. He's been wanting to sell the business but decided to wait and see my efforts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

If you merge then you would presumably own less than 5%. \n\nReimbursing expenses and merging seems weird. You get paid back at book value with no gain. Then what? You work for him. \n\nI think you need to explain the actual deal if you understand it. If not don\u2019t do it.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019m glad you caught that as well. Reimbursing all my expenses, equipment purchases, and etc. at book value is very strange. \n\nWe are trying to become one company. He is starting a branch location in Mexico and China. I will be starting another branch location in South Korea. We want all locations to be under one company and share the same books. All of us would be on salary and we would hire a 3rd party accounting firm to make sure the books are clean.\n\nBefore taking those steps, we want to finalize our merge. His main goal was to be bought out. He didn\u2019t want to create more locations until we started discussing the possibilities of the future. He\u2019s 66 yrs old and I\u2019m 26. He has a son around my age and wanted to arrange a marriage with his son and my sister. I know\u2026very old school.\n\nCan you help explain your first statement? Also, thanks for commenting!\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been thinking a lot of your comment. I know my percentage would be very low due to the difference in evaluation. Are you suggesting I can negotiate with sweat equity? I\u2019m working on sales &amp; marketing as well. If I can bring in $X amount of revenue then it would mean more shares of the business? Somebody has to take over this business and I want to take on that role if possible.",

            "comment": "Best thing you can do right now is to talk to a lawyer/ advisor. Given your scale, you need to pay per hour. You need them to explain to you what is going on and what are your options. Currently the whole thing is confusing the way you described it, and you're mixing issues that shouldn't be mixed.\n\nCompanies are valued as a multiple of profits, indeed. So you need to figure out what is both of yours normalised EBITDA looks like, to know how much each company is worth. As someone already mentioned, the difference in scale between the two companies makes it near impossible to have a 50/50 merged entity because your %ownership will just be too low. \n\nYou need to be very clear about what it means for both of you to \"take over from him\". It could mean that you own 100% of the shares = you buy him out (do you have enough liquidity to do that?). It could also mean, that you take over as operator/ CEO. In that case you are simply a salaried employee while the counter-party retains full ownership of their company (and possibly yours, if they buy you out). This means that you don't own anything and likely that you need to give up your own business just to have a \"job\". \n\nGiving up your biz at book value makes no sense unless you're insolvent. \n\nFinally, I understand that his children don't want to take over in a sense that they don't want to run it. But don't be naive, it's highly unlikely that they will give up millions in value just like that. Company A has sufficient scale to exit to a PE player, so in theory the kids/ owner can simply \"cash out\". That's what I would do if I was retiring. Which by the way, can happen with you as a salaried CEO.",

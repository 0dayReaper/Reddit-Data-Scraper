Twilio seems to have some restriction on urls, basically the messages cannot have the URL in it.  example - \" you have a notification on - ww....\"\n\nI have given my number for verification but it is still pending verification, and it can take more than 6 weeks.  Are there any other alternative that does not require so much verification or just fast verification. \n\nThanks in advance",

I might be able to help you. \n\nThe restrictions may be imposed by the carriers, not twilio. \n\nHow much monthly volume do you have?\n\nAre you using toll free numbers?\n\nDo your messages follow a particular pattern? \n\nMessage me and we can discuss.",

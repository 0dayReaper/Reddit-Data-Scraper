    "postText": "What's up guys. I'm 18 years old, German and currently on self improvement. I'm working on building a online business and I'm also in a mentoring program. Besides that I do sports 6 times a week (boxing+gym). My goal is to become the strongest, most competent, richest and best version of myself. I want to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible and thats what I\u2019m working on right now. If your goal Is the same or similar feel free to send me a\ndm.\n\nWe already made a group with a couple of people who are also working on their businesses or already have some and where we are talking about anything self improvement related and maybe somebody wants to join",

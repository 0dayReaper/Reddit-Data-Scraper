    "postText": "Hello, i have been a long time lurker of this subreddit and i have seen quite a lot of people succeed over the years, on here and elsewhere. whilst i have certain traits that can help me succeed entrepreneurially ( easily come up with ideas, unique solutions to problems, observant, can get obsessive once captivated ) , i have one roadblock,   my impulsivity and just a lack of follow through on a lot of ideas. the result is over the last 8 years i have built/created nothing while a lot of opportunities have passed me by. this summer i do have an opportunity to work on something ( because i only will be working 4 hours during the week )\n\ni want to beat my flaw by creating something tangible this summer, i just don't want to be the guy that had a lot of exciting ideas and had a lot of people convinced but ended up building nothing.\n\nwhat are small tangible entrepreneurial projects i can work on to build that belief in myself and develop that consistency/track record of =building/doing things ? \n\nhelp me transition from a wannabe/sweet talker to the real thing. i am already registered as a sole proprietor",

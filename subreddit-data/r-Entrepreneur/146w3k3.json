And than you can charge them monthly fees (around 60 bucks) to maintain the websites, and they claim you can make a insane amount of money doing this but there has to be a catch. Otherwise everyone would be doing it, so what\u2019s the catch? I haven\u2019t seen any immediate red flags like a course or guru. If it\u2019s legit what would be the best way to learn and get started in this business. Such as recommended forums and YouTube videos.",

            "comment": "There are lots of catches. \n\nFirstly go onto Fiverr and you'll find hundreds of people who will build a template based website for a around $100. You're competing against all those people, most will have much more skills, experience and a portfolio bigger than yours.\n\nNext let's looks at the \"numbers\" in the video. It says to build 10 sites a week. What it doesn't say is that each site will take you conservatively four hours. So that's 40 hours per week with no guarantee of a sale.\n\nThen you need to go out and convince businesses to buy these sites. No easy task. Plus convincing them to pay $399 is VERY optimistic. Any that do want to buy will want changes, which might take you another 4 - 10 hours or more.\n\nHe then suggests you charge $67 a  month for updates. Again, that is VERY optimistic. Any business that does agree for a retention fee will want value for money, so you will be working another five or six hours a month for your monthly fee.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with trying his approach, but go into it with your eyes open and don't be surprised if you build ten sites, spend $120 and 40+hours and make zero sales.",

Than if they say yes you can make it and that would save a bunch of time",

The guy's idea that you build the site first is a good one, but as I said, it wouldn't surprise me if you have to speak to 50 businesses before one says yes, not the two a week he uses in his example.\n\nBut as I said, what have you got to lose if you build ten sites, other than $120 and 40+hours of your time?",

            "comment": "The actual creation and launch of the site is not too bad, though you will get some clients who want endless rounds of revisions. The main problem is that after the site is launched, they will flood you with emails asking questions and wanting to know if certain things can be changed. Just replying to all their emails quickly enough to keep them happy is an enormous job, one that you can't really charge for. You will sometimes spend four to six hours out of an eight hour day answering questions from people with the subject line \"quick question\".\n\nSo, if you can't directly charge for all the time spent on customer service, you have to make sure it is covered by the monthly fee you're charging them. For $60/mo I wouldn't include much in the way of updates. I'd make that cover only hosting and basic email support. Maybe very minor text updates, but no more than that.\n\nSource: owned a web design agency.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s so much more to this than what they say in the video. \n\nI sell websites to small businesses with monthly subscriptions and lump sum pricing. You won\u2019t make an insane amount of money selling $300 sites and $60 service packages. It will take an insane amount of work to make an insane amount of money. To make $5k a month on monthly Charges you\u2019ll need to sell 83 websites. How long does it take you to make a website? Not importantly, how long does it take you to make a sale? If you can consistently sell 4 websites a month that\u2019s almost 2 years. No to mention you\u2019ll have drop offs and people who cancel. That\u2019s not also including WHY someone should even pay you and trust you to make a website. Just because you watched a couple YouTube videos and tutorials on using wix do you think you have the skills and expertise to make a good website now? The answer is no. When a client asked you what you do that\u2019s better than the Cheap Fiverr devs, what will you say? What\u2019s your unique selling point? That\u2019s you\u2019re just better? What do you DO that\u2019s better? WHY should they go with you? Who are you that makes you the expert and to be trusted? Websites are more than just putting it up without giving a shit. It\u2019s not a field of dreams that if you build it they will come. You\u2019ll build a few sites and those clients will see little to no benefit from them and will eventually cancel and won\u2019t even refer you to their other friends. You\u2019ll forever be trying to flip as many cheap wix and Wordpress themes as possible every year scraping the bottom go the barrel clients to get it. They depend on their websites to make a living and grow their business. Some guy that spent a few hours watching videos won\u2019t be able to give them something quality that will actually help. You\u2019ll make no decisions with purpose, it will all be based on superficial understandings. Why do you do this? \u201cIdk the videos said to do it this way because SEO\u201d. \n\nWeb dev is a sea of Shit you have to swim through to find that one guy with a lifeboat who knows how to rise above the Shit. It\u2019s a Wild West where anyone can claim to be anything and know anything. The fiver and upwork devs working for Pennies will push you out because they\u2019re using the same tools you are, so why should a client pay you more to use them? That\u2019s the problem you will run into. When you use the same tools and methods as someone charging much less, what makes you worth more money to do the same work with the same tools? \n\nI charge $150 a month. Or $3500 lump sum. I sell both very regularly. People come to me after being burned by fiver devs or cheap template flippers making big claims and giving them a turd. Why do people come to me and pay me more to do the same job? Because I do a better job. My unique selling point is I DONT use page builders or cheap themes. I have designers who custom design my sites and I custom code them all by hand and a copywriter who writes SEO charged content so the site ranks and ads and SEO people to handle the marketing, logo guys, etc. we KNOW what makes a good website, what converts, what ranks and why, and most importantly - what makes a bad site and why. There\u2019s so much that goes into making a GOOD website and not just a good enough website. People aren\u2019t paying me for a website. They\u2019re paying me for my expertise and access to my team and their expertise. When it comes down to me and some other cheaper Wordpress devs or overseas devs I win out 9/10 times because of it. The 1/10 ends up coming back because the dev they went with didn\u2019t deliver as promised. \n\nI\u2019ve spent years building a reputation and workflow to be able to put out quality work incredibly fast and build a team around me that allows me to do it. Yes, it is possible to make good money doing this and get residual income and build a successful business. But you can\u2019t do it if you do it half assed looking for a get rich quick scheme. This ain\u2019t the line of work for that. To get ahead in this industry you need your whole ass in it. And your heart. And your hearts ass. Everything. Anyone telling you otherwise is only selling a dream. And Dreams are easier to sell than hard work. \n\nYou wanna do this? Start teaching yourself to code websites with self paced online courses, and learn everything you can about google core vitals and page speed and what\u2019s called \u201con page SEO\u201d and how to maximize it as a developer, website conversion funnels, landing pages, etc. be able to code any design. And do it efficiently. Use those skills to sell against others with little to no skill and differentiate yourself. Be better.",

            "comment": "The main issue is that people paying $50 can be just as hard work as people paying $50,000. You have to be crazy strict on what you are selling and almost any customization can wipe out your margin and ability to generate and close more websites. Otherwise, why not build 1 million sites for $1 per year. The above is why mostly. Also you have to sell constantly, a good week means a few weeks of delivery and no selling in that time. As such, it's better to go for less higher priced contracts than a ton of cheap clients",

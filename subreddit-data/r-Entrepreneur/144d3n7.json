    "postText": "I\u2019ve been working as a freelancers for a couple years and I\u2019m looking to move more into a consultancy set up.\n\nOne thing I see other people in my space doing to promote themselves that I think really stands out is they\u2019re regularly posting insights and wisdom on social media, mostly LinkedIn, and almost daily.\n\nThe difference maker is that they aren\u2019t just re-sharing inspirational quotes or easy content. It\u2019s usually very thoughtful and timely wisdom or personal anecdotes related to their field or specialty.\n\nI have to imagine it\u2019s working well for them because it always gets a lot of comments and likes, and they continue to do it regularly even though it\u2019s also probably quite time consuming.\n\nI\u2019m curious if any of you all are doing this, and if so, what is your workflow like?  \nI definitely have it in me to create such content, but the challenge is usually on both extremes.\n\nOn one end, I have a hard time coming up with ideas on a consistent and regular enough basis to get them out there.\n\nOn the other hand, when I do sit down and make the space to start writing something, the ideas flow a mile a minute. I\u2019m flooded with ideas and I struggle to zero in on which ones to focus on for development. This is even after having done some evaluation on the types of topics I could write about and how to share value.\n\nI\u2019m sure I could figure it out eventually but I\u2019d love to hear any insights that might be available in this subreddit too.\n\nHow do you funnel ideas into concise posts in a way that\u2019s time and energy effective?\n\nDo you batch this work or do you think of something new and interesting each and every day?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear any other thoughts, insights or shortcuts anybody has to offer too.\n\nThanks!",

It has an amazing AI writing tool that helps generate unique and relevant content. It even assists with creating catchy bios, descriptions, and more. It's been a lifesaver for me and might just be what you're looking for.",

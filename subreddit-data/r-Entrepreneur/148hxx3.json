    "postText": "Many guys here afraid of being copyed.\n\nI'll tell you something. Anyone can copy your business even after launched. There's no difference.\n\nHiding your ideas from everybody it's just a form of procrastination and delay you results. Talk to more people is the best way to find solutions to your problems.\n\nHow do you think you'll find investors, partners or even clients when nobody knows what you're talking about.\n\nAnd please don't ask people to sign an NDA just to tell your idea. They you laugh on your face. We talk about NDAs to discuss details about your technology for example, before this is just bullshit.\n\nAnd let's be honests, if your idea is soooo good why don't you started your business yet?\nIt's because the key point here it's not the idea, it's the execution.\n\nI could have the idea to launch rockets to colonize Mars. But i have no clue how to make it happen. So, FOR ME thats a shitty idea.\n\nTell your plans, ask for help, and maybe your dreams will come true. Keep hiding and watch another guy build it before you.\n\nI know there's a ton of lurkers here, but usually they don't know fuck about shit to try copy someone. Just relax and do your job.\n\nBy the way. I'm not a builder, or dev or nothing like that. I'm a sales/marketing guy. And if you need help to develop or sell your product/service, talk to me. I can help you.",

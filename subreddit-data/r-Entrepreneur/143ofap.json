    "postText": "So i watched a countless videos etc etc on making a business and how to be a millionaire. However there has not been a single video on YOUTUBE history or perhaps a book (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) that will tell the initial steps, stages on how to make a SUCCESSFUL business, not be a millionaire, not be rich, but simple build a business, like an actual step by step process, e.g. which vendors to get in touch, what to do afterwards, these small small steps. \n\nSo anyone with a big heart, would you like to share anything for someone whose struggling right now.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m building an agency, I will document it step by step, even if it flops.",

Great way of breaking down big abstract tasks is to start thinking about the effect and just going one step backwards - what has resulted in such an effect? And you need to repeat it until you arrive at the present. If you note down all the steps you should have a road map. It will probably create a lot of specific questions - maybe then try to sort them and ask professionals about those things.",

Then once u have that info, figure out a unique advantage/selling point compare to your competitors (and is valuable to your customers), and build a MVP product quickly so you can get it infront of customers to receive feedback and iterate to refine your idea/product.\n\nIf u need more help on the specific, I would recommend you use my website at ideationfuture.com to do an in-depth market/customer/competitors analysis and go from there. Also feel free to email me directly at gordon-at-ideationfuture.com for any questions",

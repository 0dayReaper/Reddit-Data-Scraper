    "postText": "Hey guys, I just wanna say that I never liked books too much because they have few lessons that can be explained in few pages, written in like 400 pages... Just so they can get published.. But I have recently stumbled upon this little 9 page free ebook that is actually useful and you can go through it in no time... Will it magically change your life?NO! Will it move you one step closer to where you wanna go? Yes. I genuinely recommend it if you have like 10min to spare, it costs nothing and I am sure you will take away at least one lesson from it...\n\ncant really share a link, but the title is: Brain | Focus | Success\ntype in web search: https://www.interstellarfocus.com/free-book",

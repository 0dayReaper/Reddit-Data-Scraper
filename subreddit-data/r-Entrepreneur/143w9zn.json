    "postText": "Here we are again on day 2 of dropping value. \n\nI was inspired by the engagement I got yesterday. 400 upvotes. Let\u2019s go \n\nHere are my findings of the day:\n\n#1/ Freejobalerts. com \n\nThis website based in India is making $100k+ a month. \n\nIt\u2019s simple - They just sends users alerts for newly available jobs.\n\nBusiness model: Display Ads. \n\nThey get about 13M visitors per month. So my $100k estimate might actually be low. \nIt might be even more.\n\nSomeone can just copy the same idea and create freejob alerts for other countries. \n\nJust have to scrape available jobs and aggregate the data. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#2- Everydaypower. com\n\nThis site is pretty awesome. it\u2019s a collection of inspirational quotes making $250K/ year. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t get simpler than that.\n\n\ud83d\udc49The site was created in 2013 and has become one of the largest and most popular websites for inspirational quotes. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 It gets about 1,9M visitors per month.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 $20K/month \n\nInspirational Quotes are free and available for anyone to use. \n\nThey just aggregated them under one place and ranked the site through SEO \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#3 - MouseDining. com \n\nA website that gives you alert when Disney Reservations become available. \n\nThere are a lot of events going on at Disney world and Disney land. \n\nIt\u2019s super hard to get reservations with crazy wait time. \n\nThis website simply sends you alerts. \n\nThey constantly check availability and notify you when something opens up. \n\nSimple pricing.\n\nFree for individuals - 6 alerts\n$9/ months for - 50 alerts \n$90 per year - 100 \n\n(They appeal to businesses, travel planner, agencies and people that are going all the time) \n\nGetting traffic through SEO (144k monthly visit) and Word to mouth\n\nCouldn\u2019t find their exact number but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re banking. \n\nSimilarweb estimates that they\u2019re making $2M - $5M per year\n\nKind of a simple Genius idea!\n\nSee you tomorrow - Day 3!",

I just don't want to allow people to think our service is \"simple\" at our scale.",

I\u2019ve become really good at what I do but it bothers me now that I make such a small commission when I can see how much money the company makes off of me. I can do this on my own and I\u2019ve figured out how, and the starting costs are slim, but it will take time to get it going and I need to be able to take care of my monthly bills in that time.\n\nI legitimately do not know how to find funding for something like this, but I have records to prove that I\u2019m a leader in my company at what I do and if I can get through six months of building it independently then I\u2019ll be set for life and I\u2019ll be able to pay back the initial investment with interest or bonus or whatever will make it worth the investor\u2019s while.\n\nWhat do people do to get this sort of thing going?",

            "comment": "It depends. How much money do you need to have invested? For most investors it is going to be a risky proposition, because you don't yet have something tangible to show for it and that means they would have to believe in you personally, which is a difficult thing to do without knowing someone or their track record.\n\nSay if you were a software developer, like yours truly. You might be tempted to assume that just because you can easily replicate the business you work for from tech standpoint, you can run the business just as successfully. There are many facets to running a successful business and those facets don't show themselves until you get started. There are lot of unknowns, which you may dismiss, but investors wouldn't.\n\nIf the sum you are looking for is an amount you can save - this would be the best option. Second best would be to ask your family, friends and relatives to invest. Finding and convincing outside investors will be more challenging, but not impossible. Again, it all depends on specifics of what you're up to and up against.\n\nIf you can give us a rough idea of the sum you need and industry you're in, maybe we can brainstorm better solutions. Good luck!",

The reason why I ask is this: Your financial obligations permitting, you could really tighten the belt and save up as much as you can for x months, then use the savings to bootstrap. \n\nIf it is time sensitive and it would not after say 6 months, then it would be harder to convince an outside investor. Depending on where you are, 6 figure salary would allow you to get  20k unsecured loan at the bank too, this is another option. The rest of the money could come from friends/family if you have such a circle around you.",

My partner is fantastic at what she does, but didn\u2019t have the money to start her own agency. \n\nI hired her from upwork for my (now failed) business. I saw her have an amazing process with great results and I asked her if she had her own agency or if she was interested in starting one. She wanted to and we are now building something amazing together. \n\nYou can find an investor anywhere, friends, family, strangers. The only thing is you need to think about what you fully want from an investor and make sure the terms are in writing and crystal clear. Do you want someone to give you money and essentially go away and leave you alone (of course they still receive financial rewards from the business), or someone to be hands on everyday, or someone who has business experience that you can call for advice and maybe they can help you connect with contractors or something else that\u2019s useful? All are perfectly acceptable, but all their skill sets may be different and are a conversation to have. It\u2019s also necessary to talk about how much you need in total, your timeline for profitability, and any other pertinent information \n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I\u2019d be happy to help you as best I can",

            "comment": "\"I legitimately do not know how to find funding for something like this\"\n\nThat's exactly the point though of why your commission is small. Sales is the important part here. \n\nQuick story, me and friend are both engineers, started a business. because he would design all these prodcuts for the company he worked for, he did it all, mechanical, electrical, thermal, tech, assembly, did the iphone apps. everything. they paid him basically min wage when you accounted his unpaid overtime and no benefits cause he was contract.\n\nSo he thought we would start this business cause he knew everything and could do it all. That maybe true in engineering, but what about business? Sales? customer relations.. accounting, etc etc.  You make one wrong accounting mistake and it could shut down everything. \n\nBeing an engineer i was always biased that we do all the work, but now i realize why sales people get paid so much. and they should, without the sales, nothing matters. You can design garabge, and be a bad engineer, but if there is a good sales team, they are going to sell it. which is better for business? \n\nNot to be discouraging but since your post is kind of vague, i figured I would make some assumptions here. Are you replaceable at your job? if you quit today, how fast would they have someone else in there doing the same thing?",

            "comment": "First rule of entrepreneurship - Be wary of outside investors.\n\nYou seem to be confident of your skills and capability. I would suggest the following option:\n\n1) Create a business plan - keep it simple. Does what you have in mind have a large enough market? Are there many competitors? Will you be building just a better \"mousetrap\" or something new and improved? How are you going to price it? How many can you sell in a month/year? What would be the expenses - a) One time and b) Recurring? Can you develop and sell it yourself or do you need a team? If latter, how much equity are you willing to part? What is your core strength and what would you need from your partner(s)?\n\n2) A plan like in (1) flushes out the unknowns and forces you to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Though I woud advise against going with outside investors at this stage, you may find an \"angel investor\" who is willing to fund. A biz plan which has thought out all the above will tell him/her that you have done your homework and that you are meticulous.\n\nI would suggest approach family, friends in that order. Borrow from your parents, uncles/aunts/granparents, etc. Build small and scale up fast. You also need to have a clear idea of the market, and how to approach it. Your sales strategy is important. Once you reach critical mass then you can go in for angel or seed funding.\n\nWhile it is good that you feel you are the top earner for your company, it is taking the large cut off of you since it provides all the other backup support for you. If you go out on your own you have to do everything by yourself, and efficiently in order to survive.\n\nLastly, dont be in a hurry to quit. Start putting together your plan while your company is still paying you. Create a 6 month \"piggy bank\" that can fund you even if you dont have any revenues. Also be careful of possibility that your company may sue you for \"stealing secrets\". Build that risk into your plans.\n\nGood Luck.",

Many people may share your content without linking back to your site. As a result, it is critical that you keep as complete a list of sites that publish your content as possible. This can be accomplished by configuring Google Alerts.   \nBottom-line is, to\u00a0conduct a follow-up SEO.",

However, there's a MASSIVE caveat, the person prompting needs to be of high-quality editor caliber.\n\nSo, for instance, you probably are. I am as well.\n\nI know what I would need to do to write an article about X to rank within the top 5 (assuming I've properly accounted for site authority &amp; KD)\n\nNormally, I'd agree with you and say \"no fucking way AI can do this!\", but I did it, and then realized why it worked so well.\n\n1.) It can spin out ideas, lists, even little web apps to add to your content to make it that much better.\n\n2.) It's faster.\n\n3.) It can write and rewrite in tones, as many as you want. Whatever style you like.\n\nThe issue of course is the output can be generic at time. You need to know the prompts for this. You need to be able to say \"I want x, quit giving me Y, add z resource and turn it into a table\", .etc.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nAll things being equal (editor running prompts, site authority, keyword difficulty) I'll take me + AI every single time. I've had some amazing results.\n\nNow, there's one thing none of us know just yet - how this will impact rankings in the future. I can edit AI well enough you couldn't tell a machine was anywhere near it, but what happens when there are AI-specific markers embedded or disclosure required by law - what then?\n\nFor now, it works. It works well enough billion dollar public companies are firing content teams to leverage it. It absolutely can create masterpiece-level content with the right editor in a short amount of time.\n\nSomeday it may not do any of those things by law or without disclosure.",

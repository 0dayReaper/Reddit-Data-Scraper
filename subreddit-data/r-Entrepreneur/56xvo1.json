    "postText": "I saw the other t shirt thread on here the other day and thought you guys might be interested in a completely different approach. Unlike the other thread, where they picked a single niche and went through getting feedback, testing small versions of their ideas, and asking customers what they wanted, my business partner and I did something completely different. We decided to go after what was already selling and attempt to give customers a better design. On top of that, we decided to sell them on Amazon.com with as little work as possible since this was a side business. Here is [exactly how we did it](http://www.passive.marketing/made-150000-merch-amazon-2016/). We managed to hit $150,000+ in profit within a single year.\n\n**MERCH BY AMAZON (POD SERVICE)**\n\nI am sure you have all heard of other print on demand (POD) services out there. I know a lot of shit is talked about starting t shirt companies, and I completely understand why. Most people fail when they start one. I have given half attempts before at selling shirts on Teespring or other services. The issue is you have to drive your own traffic (which costs money), and tons of testing to get it right. I failed as well, along with the majority of other people.\n\nWell, late last year, Amazon announced they were coming out with their own print on demand service. They were calling it Merch By Amazon. All you would have to do was sign up, upload designs, and they would take care of printing, shipping, and customer service. The best part was there were no minimums. If someone bought 1 design, they would print that single design and ship it. All you had to do was upload.\n\nIf you are at all interested, you can sign up here: [https://merch.amazon.com/landing](https://merch.amazon.com/landing). It changed into an invite only program, so you will need to sign up and wait. Everyone gets accepted but it may be some time in the future as they can barely keep up with demand the way it is. You see, they first thought that this program was going to be used just by developers, but other people saw the money signs, and it quickly was changed to invite only.\n\n**TIER SYSTEM**\n\nWhen you first get an account, you are capped at 25 designs. You must sell 25 shirts before getting tiered up to 100. You must sell 100 shirts to be tiered up to 500. So on and so forth. Currently, the biggest tier I know of personally is 8,000 (where my account currently stands).\n\nWe knew when we signed up that we needed to increase the amount of slots we could upload as fast as possible. Both my partner and I had an account and tried out two different strategies. He through up as many designs as he could but out priced the competition. This quickly got him 25 sales, and tiered up. For my account, I went a bit slower but focused my time on Amazon BSR (more on that below).\n\n**Quick Note:** If you are designing your own shirts, there is ZERO costs up front. If you price a shirt at 19.99, you make almost $8 per shirt sold. If you sell your shirt at $15.99, you make 4.28 per shirt.\n\n**MAKING SALES WITH ZERO MARKETING**\n\nAs you see above in the note, if you are designing your own shirts, you do not have to put any money up front. This is great because if you have a shirt that is not selling, you are not stuck holding the bag on all that inventory. It also allows you to pivot your strategies if they are not working quickly.\n\nYou may look at the numbers posted and think why would you waste your time making $4.28 per t-shirt sold? The answer is, because you are selling on Amazon, one of the most trafficked sites on the internet. They get so much traffic each and every day, that if you set up your listing properly, you will see organic sales.\n\nNot only will you see organic sales, but you do not have to go mad with dealing with reviews (like we had to with PL on Amazon). People feeling lost over the latest review policy on Amazon will be happy to know that with Merch you pay almost no attention to reviews.\n\nSo how did we set everything up to make sales without paying a dime to market them? We based all our designs off niches and designs that were already selling!\n\nThere is no need to reinvent the wheel here. All we needed to do was find something that was selling well, and improve the design in some way.\n\nTo do this, we look at Amazon BSR or best sellers rank. Each and every listing that is selling at all has one of these. You can find it by finding a product on Amazon, scrolling down to the product information, and you should see something that looks like this:\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/additional-information.png\n\nHere you can see the Amazon Best Sellers Rank for this item. The BSR is a representation of how well that item is selling. From my time selling on Amazon FBA and selling on Amazon Merch, a good rule of thumb is that if an item has a BSR of 100,000 in clothing, that shirt is probably selling 1 design every day. The lower the number, the more shirts are being sold each day.\n\nIf the BSR is around #2,000 you can expect that the shirt is selling 25-50 of that design daily. Around #400,000 and the design is probably selling once or twice a week. The more you sell on Amazon and keep track of the BSR, the better idea you will get on how it correlates to sales. Just remember that the lower the number, the more popular the shirt is with consumers! Keep that in mind when doing research.\n\n**COPYRIGHT**\n\nYou also need to have a full understanding that you cannot infringe on copyright with Merch. You may come across some shirts with a very low BSR, but they might have disney characters or sayings on them. You clearly do not own the intellectual property to those sayings or images so this would be infringement. If Merch catches you, they will take that design down and send you an email telling you not to do it again. If you get enough of these, your account will eventually be closed, so you need to be careful.\n\nTo ensure no sayings or characters are copyrighted, you should be checking all your ideas through one or both of these websites. I prefer Trademarkia, as they are much more user friendly and I have had zero issues since starting Merch by using them.\n\n* [Trademarkia](http://www.trademarkia.com/)\n* [USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database)\n\n**FINDING DESIGNS**\n\nNow that you understand Amazon\u2019s Best Sellers Rank, and know that you need to be checking Copyright, you can now start looking for designs. The goal is to find shirts with a low BSR that cannot be Copyrighted. This means they are SELLING and that customers like products in that niche. You can then go on to create shirt designs that are much better than what is currently being offered and make sales!\n\nYou could go on Amazon and start searching for keywords. You could go and click on each individual shirt that pops up for your keyword searches and look at each listing to see what the BSR is. You could also search for each and every name through Trademarkia individually.\n\nThese are the exact steps that we took when building our accounts at first.\n\n\u2026 But it took a long time! What started out as a side project, ended up taking time away from multiple other projects that we were working on.\n\n&gt; I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. ~ Bill Gates\n\nSo, wanting to continue the upward trend in earnings without wasting our time searching hundreds of listings on Amazon, we came up with a better way.\n\n**WE CREATED OUR OWN SOFTWARE**\n\nFor the last 5 months, along with growing on Merch by Amazon, we have been developing a way to automate the process of finding low enough BSR t-shirts to improve on: **[Merch Informer](http://merchinformer.com/)**.\n\nWithout sitting here and selling you on the idea, we have actually been using it for the past few months to grow the account. Merch Informer lets you search up to 5 keywords at once, take the top 100 best selling t-shirts for each of those keywords and sort them by Amazon\u2019s best seller rank. This allowed me to save a shit load of time when coming up with the designs, and then could easily combine them into a list, and fire them off to my designers.\n\nHere are a couple of screens of the software. Pretty proud of what we have created so far. We have not released it yet, but will within the next week hopefully.\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/search-keywords.png\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cat-shirt-results.png\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-search.png\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/more-cat-tees.png\n\n**OUTSOURCING DESIGNS**\n\nI am a big believer in bootstrapping your own business until you can afford to pay other people to do the dirty work. When I first started with Merch, I designed all my shirts. I think I designed around 125-150 before the concept could start paying for itself. I am a god awful designer and can barely use photoshop but a few hours on Youtube tutorials and I was able to create enough designs to start paying some bills.\n\nAfter I knew I could reinvest the money, I went out to hire some designers. I know Upwork screwed a lot of us over with their change in pricing structure, but that is still the best place I know of to find talent. Here is the exact script I used to hire a couple of full time designers that are still with me to this day:\n\n&gt; Hey, I am in need of 400 t-shirt designs in the time period of 2-3 months.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your task will be pretty basic, I will send you ideas of t-shirts I want to make and you make them even better and unique. For example, I might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and I would need it being inspired by it and made even better and unique.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will leave you a lot of 5* reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a long-term position needed. Once we have done the first batch of 400 \u2013 around 4 per day, we could continue if everything looks good.\n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to doing business with you!\n\nI ended up paying $4 per design. I looked at this as a zero sum game as you can get the designs for $4, and if you sell a single design you make $4.28 (if you price at $15.99 per shirt), so I knew that even if I was spending money to outsource, I would eventually make it back since I was selling on the biggest marketplace out there.\n\n**Quick Tip On Getting Rid Of Bad Designers:** \n\nWhen I first tried to hire someone to design for me, they stole images and straight up copied designs. This is wrong, and will get your Merch account banned. I was not able to use any of these designs.\n\nWhen I first hired someone, I let them know that they cannot use any images which are Copyrighted, or infringe on any Copyright someone else owns.\n\nThen, I will send them a T-Shirt idea that is very clearly Copyright infringement. If they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use, I will immediately get rid of that designer. The design may have cost me $4, but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats!\n\n**SELLING YOUR T-SHIRT BUSINESS**\n\nWhen it comes down to it, this is a business and should be treated as such (not just a hobby). We are all here to make money.\n\nI have hinted at this in the past, but now it is just time to come out and say it.\n\nEarlier this year, my business partner and I decided to sell a Merch account. Since the platform was so new, we knew it was going to be difficult to find a buyer.\n\nWe reached out to a few website brokers, but none of them were willing to accept a Merch account as the vast majority did not have any idea what the platform even was! Then I got in touch with my friends at [Empire Flippers](https://empireflippers.com/). They just did an AMA here by the way!\n\nI had sold a site with them previously and am told it is still doing well to this day. I reached out and asked if they would be interested in taking on this project and selling it for me.  It turns out they were! I described exactly what the platform was, how it works, and what needed to happen to get the process started.\n\nSince it is not a website, I simply paid the listing fee, and then emailed them over all the earnings statements and documents needed to prove that we owned the account and it was making what I said it was making. The account averaged about $3,000 a month at that point.\n\nI ended up doing a seller interview with them, and got the listing posted.\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sold.png\n\nWe talked to a bunch of interested parties, but finally came to an agreement and sold the account without an issue!\n\n**WHERE WE ARE TODAY**\n\nThere we have it. All the steps laid out 1-by-1 that we used to make over $150,000 in 2016 with Merch by Amazon. When you add up the monthly earnings that account was making, the sales price, and what my account is currently doing per month, you can see the vast opportunity that is in front of us. There has never been an easier way to make money online than by selling T-Shirts on Amazon.\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/amazonmerch2.png\n\nTo leave you with a little inspiration, here is my current account sales for the week. You can see how many shirts I currently have live as well as what tier I am at. Good luck out there and keep pushing forward!\n\nhttp://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/current-earnings.png\n\nAny questions just drop them below.",

There are some ideas with low overhead that have more inquiries,  such as T-shirts.   I applaud every one of them for giving it a shot and really get turned off by the gripes over this issue,  because the gripes and jabs are about as common as the topics. I think its a mistake of thinking this a content channel,  not a discussion board.  There are people who will learn business by flipping on ebay,  dropshipping,  selling shirts or subs,  and they will learn business WAY faster than those who sit and wait for SOMEDAY having $50K to start a higher overhead biz,  and then destroy themselves b/c they hadn't learned anything in a smaller biz first.

More importantly, the people who actually know how to run a business recognize that asking for business advice on Reddit is just about as terrible as asking for legal advice. \n\nIt's kind of created a situation where the same old churn gets thrown around all of the time  You get a bunch of people, including me, with an interest in starting a business but lacking experience, skills, or ability to take risk; a few cases of mis-guided, bound to fail businesses; and fewer cases of successful businesses. I tend to feel that this sub thrives on the survivorship bias that has come from the few high profile success stories.\n\nT-shirts, maid services, and subscriptions boxes are attractive because they are relatively cookie-cutter, low-risk, and there have a been a couple high profile examples of them being successful (this post for example). It ends up fueling most of the discussion as nearly everyone can relate and I imagine most people feel these types of businesses are in reach (realistically, they can be started with less than $1k upfront investment).\n\nIf you're looking for critical discussion, white-papers, actual data/advice/information, book-lists, podcasts, etc, it's probably best to continue looking elsewhere. This is not a place to build a deep understanding of business. Heck look at the front page of the sub-right now, it's basically people bragging about success, people talking about huge (and stupid) risks they're taking (again, bragging), or people asking for advice on low effort businesses.\n\nI've been subscribed to this sub for a good long time and have considered leaving several times.  I stay around because from time to time there is good discussion and there are interesting topics. The rest of the time, I try to keep an outsider looking in perspective. I find that the mentality of this sub is very toxic if you are concerned about building a business that's around for the long haul - not just the current trend.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: A couple requests on where to look. I don't really have a good answer to that. \n\nI've heard only good things about Paul Graham's blog. I don't read it though, because from what I hear it tends to be focused on startups in tech (i.e. high growth venues). Nothing wrong with it, I just don't think I'll look to start to high growth venture.\n\nI'm really hesitant about almost everything in the business field. The people who are popular are often popular because they're good at selling things. They don't necessarily have great advice, but they can sell it like great advice.\n\nIf you're serious about starting a business, I'd recommend looking into joining your local small business organization. More than likely, you'll be trying to model yourself after a small business. You'll quickly see what successful companies are doing and what the failures aren't. Most of the people in these groups are very experienced, but also willing to help a bushy-eyed beginner (many of them clearly remember the help they got when they were bushy-eyed)\n\nPersonally, I find that working against a goal is a much better learning experience (i.e. building a simple business plan). Find an idea you're interested in. Think about everything that is involved in making that happen and work through the process as if you're going to release that idea as a product. You'll quickly find the areas that you'll excel at and things you totally suck at.  Once you know what you suck at, there are plenty of resources on each specific topic that should be able to help you.",

That's easy to do. You learn about eBay and building a website and other places.\n\nYou learn about shipping and then restocking (which is an artform itself). You learn about refunds and what to do with bad product.\n\nIf you fail, you don't lose much. \n\nThere is endless demand for cool t-shirts and if you're printing in batches of 20 you can still make enough profit to keep going.\n\nA mate and I did it and grew our $300 each invested up to about $3000. Then we got bored, wanted to do other things and shut it down. All online sales.\n\nI love the t-shirt company idea.

Considering you were just starting out I always recommend students, they're more serious than the average kid.\n\nBut for those who actually have a budget, local chambers, networking events, (google around), Linkedin, and possibly Facebook groups. It's all about building a relationship and networking. 90% of marketing is from referrals.   \n\nDifferent countries have different laws (or at least what I'm told). It's hard to follow something that's not custom or just not paid enough to care (I know I wouldn't.) ",

Anyone that downvotes your post should probably just leave this sub altogether. \n\nGood job man.",

Not any originality or foresight. \n\nI had a t-shirt \"business\" that made $80k over 2 years then petered out. I did literally 0 advertising or work outside of filling orders. Just printed shirts as I got orders. They were random designs/phrases/stuff/colors. Pretty simple stuff. Shut it down about a year ago. ",

I've been selling books on Amazon FBA for several years and love that I don't have to worry with shipping items to each individual customer. I put in a request for Merch by Amazon. If nothing else it will be something fun to play around and experiment with. I'm not a designer by any means, but I am friends with a lot of artsy/poor students. How would you recommend leveraging that to get designs that are selling? A lot of them already have huge portfolios of work they've done. I suppose I could just offer to buy some of their finished work to use. ",

As an example. I last made a T-shirt order in 2011, and I still have some stock.  These are sizes that will likely never sell, so that represents a loss.  This make on demand via Amazon sounds like the ideal solution for me.\n\nI have the original graphics, which I own, available.  These represent my team logo.  Apparently, they are in a format they isn't conducive to the print process - they need to be outlined for the cuts or something - I have PDFs.\n\nDo you have any advice on what I can do to get what I up up on the Amazon store so I can just direct my students there and they can order their own gear in the sizes, colors, products that they want?\n\n",

You have the PDFs and the designs so really all you need to do is put them into the template for Merch. You can find that on my blog or on Merch by Amazon's frequently asked questions I believe. If you are bad with graphics, simply hire someone on Upwork to get them placed into the template for you. Once they are in the template, save them as a PNG in the right size and you can upload them to Merch.\n\nThe wait time for Merch is pretty long right now. I would look around for someone to partner with if you want to get the designs up right away. Their tracking tools are terrible though, so its a little hard to keep track of everything.",

There are just the keywords that you put into the bullet points and description for your shirt. There are also no giveaways (not even an option because you have no inventory), or PPC. You can only advertise by placing ads in your app if you are an app developer. Since none of the apps I have are even relevant to t shirts, I do not use this.\n\nEverything I have done with Merch has been organic. If you put up good designs, with keywords sprinkled into your listing and price them right, they sell.\n\n",

Of your ~1000 designs on the market, do you get most of your sales from a few hot winners, or do you get a bunch of small sales on many designs?\n\nI'm sure Pareto's 80/20 principle applies to some extent, but I'm essentially asking if your strategy to mimic the top-sellers helps to balance it out.\n\nLet me know, thanks!",

As I tiered up and got more designs, I started focusing more on the 100-200k BSR range. In this range from experience, it tells me those designs are selling about once every day or so. There is also a lot less competition here so I will put up designs in those niches and see slow, but steady sales.",

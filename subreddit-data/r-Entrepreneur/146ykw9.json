Could be  partner, or a site like upwork, but you need a good answer.  The other thing is the write contracts in the US, think work for hire etc.  You need to talk to a lot of folks to find like minded people and figure out how to build your team.  You probably have a good idea of what skills are needed technically, so maybe focus on the rainmaker and sales components.  Communicate clear financial benefits to your team, and figure out how to communicate with all parties well.  Find a great sales person, and then rinse and repeat.",

            "comment": "I'm doing that right now. Went from nothing to around 10 recurring clients in 1 year.\n\nI do more outsourcing work, though, and I had connections. Also double the experience working in the industry you have (which I reckon is still premature but opportunities don't really wait until you get prepared).\n\nBiggest pain point you'll have is sales (and I'm actually looking for anyone who might help me with that stateside). B2B sales cycles are a pain and it's ironic how much more of it is down to building relationships compared to B2C and like I said, I had some relationships built way before I even thought about starting the company.\n\nBut what else do I do besides having friends all around? \n\nFor staters, I look into freelance sites. They don't care if you are an agency or consulting firm, even if they say they do. Invest in the premium plan and have a nice pitch with a portfolio. In the beginning, you'll be selling your own work, so feel free to share projects you did at work WITHIN THE CONFINES OF WHATEVER NDA YOU SIGNED - although you don't have to worry about that all that much when you are small and dealing with small projects.\n\nI also attend to business events, though the effectiveness of that will depend on where you are located. My local chamber of commerce hosts nice free events with many speakers but those can be very, how should I put it...? Synthetic? They don't feel very natural. That doesn't really matter much though because the main focus is to look presentable and sane enough to get invited to the after parties. That's when people really talk business. Don't dismiss the speakers, though, you can learn a lot from them! Just wish they'd loosen up a bit.\n\nThere are also paid events but they can run you dry fast before you know which one's will lead you to the right type of customer. I serve customers in finances do I attend to Fintech conferences every once in a while to talk to the people in the booths about what we've been working on. It does open doors but I'll probably have more success selling products in there.\n\nMost of my sales (~60%) still come from friends I met in middle school/high school, social events and sometimes work, so do get involved with the people you already know and start forming meaningful bonds with them. Try to practice understanding their wants and needs. If all else fails, at least it will make you a better person. In my case it also paved the way for my first few sales, which granted me precious cashflow early and allowed me to expand.\n\nThis leads me to 2 more topics I think you should know before going into this:\n\n- Employees: at first you'll be doing things on your own, then you'll probably be hiring freelancers to outsource part of the work but, unless you hire someone like me, you'll probably find it cheaper to have employees. When it comes to that, you'll likely only be able to hire people less skilled than you and in the beginning it will frustrate you because you'll be training them a lot. Be patient, they will eventually get it and you'll have the return on that investment. Regardless, I think the most important thing regarding employees is: don't be a dick. This doesn't mean you should be a pushover and interpersonal dynamics is something you'll have to navigate, but it does mean you should be reasonable and understanding. I don't want to tell you how to run your company but for me it's a results-focused endeavor and if it means the team will sleep in during the day and work at night while they take turns playing Valorant to achieve it, fine by me. Flexibility goes a long way when you are broke. Experience and education go even further. Oh and even when they leave, if you treat them right, they will bring business your way. So keep that in mind.\n\n- Management: at some point you'll have to choose between coding and managing and if you choose code, you WILL have to hire someone to manage things (even you). Look for the most organized and annoying, detailed oriented person you can. Then negotiate away 15% of their behaviour (YMMV) and you'll be all set. Trust me, you might hate your boss because they nitpick but rest assure whoever owns that company loves exactly that about them and for you it will be no different. Set some boundaries and let them handle bureaucracy and timetables. There's no formula for this, though, so you can tag team that or you can choose to do it yourself at the expense of other work.\n\nThat's more or less all I have for now. Everything else is fine tunning and deciding what kind of company you want to be. One last piece of advice: be patient. This will take a long time to even start, let alone to grow. Take it one day at a time and enjoy the ride.\n\nAnd if you do end up pursuing this and find yourself needing a team on a budget, feel free to hit me up!\n\nGood luck!",

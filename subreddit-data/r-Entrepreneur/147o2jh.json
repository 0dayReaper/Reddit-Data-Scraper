    "postText": "I have a business that currently has no revenue, but everything is all setup &amp; has a huge income potential in the right hands. I built it years ago, spent the $ to put everything together, trademarked, all the tech in place, &amp; so on. I just got to the finish line of building but never crossed the starting line for getting clients. I have went another direction for what I want to do as a career. This business is a service for realtors, it\u2019s an all in one tool/service. It gives the realtor a website with idx/mls feed lead capture tools, puts them in a CRM, automated follow up &amp; lead nurturing(also has a mobile app). That\u2019s a summary of the company. There are a few similar companies that are extremely profitable. Agent Image, Real Geeks &amp; Agent Fire are a few examples. Now being I never took that next step how would I determine the worth? I would be willing to sell %100 or consider selling %50 for less of a buy in &amp; I could stay on as an advisor. It has a great name &amp; everything is in place, so it\u2019s ready to go right away.",

            "comment": "Valuing a business without revenue can be challenging, but it's not impossible. The factors you'll need to consider include the cost of your initial investment, the time you spent developing the business, the uniqueness and potential of the concept, as well as the current market demand for such a service.\r  \n\r  \nA few methods for estimating its value:\r\n\nCost-Based Approach: Calculate all the costs you incurred setting up the business, including the cost of trademarks, technology, and any other assets. It doesn't account for future earnings, but it provides a baseline.\r\n\nMarket Comparison: Compare your business with similar ones that have sold recently. Given that you have named similar profitable companies, you can use their sales or valuation figures as a guide. But remember, their financial success (and presumably revenue generation) will likely make them more valuable than a business with similar potential but no proven revenue.\r\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: This method requires speculating how much revenue the business could generate in the future and discounting that to a present value. This can be tricky without any existing revenue or clients, but you could use industry averages or the performance of similar companies as a guide.\r\n\nInvestor's Perspective: Think about how much an investor might be willing to pay for a share of future profits. For example, if an investor typically wants a return of 10x their investment within five years, you would price the business at a level that would allow for that return.\r  \n\r  \nIf you're considering retaining a percentage of ownership, you might want to consider a smaller initial asking price to make the business more attractive to potential buyers. You could then make up the difference through the future success of the business.",

            "comment": "&gt;Now being I never took that next step how would I determine the worth?\n\nYoure not going to like this but its the only answer thats correct. Its worth what someone is willing to pay for it.\n\nI am just going to be real with you, its probably not worth anything. \n\nI think youre going about the problem in the wrong way. You think youre selling a company, but you arent. You are selling assets, and thats how I would pitch it. Why would I buy a company with no business if all I wanted were the assets? The business is a liability, the assets arent. \n\nSell the name, sell the software, sell the CRM, mobile app, etc. After you sell these pay out the purchase price in profitability to yourself, and dissolve the business. Honestly though, good luck. I wouldnt spend much time on this if you arent getting a lot of traction within a couple weeks. It seems like a sunk-cost deal right now.",

In the hands of the right person, its value has great potential.  I would focus on finding that right person, give them a sweetheart deal and reap in profit share as mostly passive income.    \n\n\nGreat job taking it this far, it seems you've put a lot of effort in.  I do wonder if once the new owner of the business acquires clients and they test what you built, are they going to find bugs, issues, needs for improvement and do you plan on supporting those changes?",

    "postText": "**Note: This is a chapter out of my [Growth Hacking Book](https://www.secretsaucenow.com) called [Secret Sauce: The Ultimate Growth Hacking Guide](https://www.secretsaucenow.com). This is only one of the 17 chapters that read just like this.**\n\n**Also, the links I posted here are broken, but you can view the whole thing beautifully formatted on Medium [here](https://medium.com/startup-grind/seo-is-not-hard-a-step-by-step-seo-tutorial-for-beginners-that-will-get-you-ranked-every-single-1b903b3ab6bb)**\n\nAfter my post about making money from an affiliate site was at the top of this sub for a couple days, I've received more than 50 PMs asking for more info on how SEO works and how to get authority sites ranking. I have a chapter about that in my book, so I'm just going to publish it for free.\n\nFor what it's worth, I drive millions of dollars of traffic in the most competitive key terms online, including with new sites, so if you come in here to comment \"this won't work\" you're wrong. It's hard work, but it's not unreasonably hard. So much so that I decided to call it \"SEO is not hard.\" \n\n**Formatting on reddit is hard, so it's also on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@austenallred/seo-is-not-hard-a-step-by-step-seo-tutorial-for-beginners-that-will-get-you-ranked-every-single-1b903b3ab6bb).**\n\nIt's also one of the several chapters of a book I wrote, which you can purchase [here](http://indiegogo.com/projects/secret-sauce-a-step-by-step-growth-hacking-guide--2)\n\n#SEO is Not Hard \u2014 A step-by-step SEO Tutorial for beginners that will get you ranked every single time\n\n##SEO In One Day \n\nSEO is simply not as hard as people pretend like it is; you can get 95% of the effort with 5% of the work, and you absolutely do not need to hire a professional SEO to do it, nor will it be hard to start ranking for well-picked key terms.\n\nOf all the channels we\u2019ll be discussing, SEO is the one that there is the most misinformation about. Some of it is subtle, but some of it is widely spread and believed by so-called SEO consultants who actually don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nSEO is very simple, and unless you\u2019re a very large company it\u2019s probably not worth hiring somebody else to do. It\u2019s also something that has a lot of faux veneer around it. Consultants want to make it seem incredibly difficult so that they can charge you a lot, but I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step, and you'll win.\n\nHow Google Works In order to understand what we need to do for SEO let\u2019s look back at how Google started, how it\u2019s evolving today, and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on Google.\n\nFirst, we're going to reverse engineer what Google is doing, and then simply follow their rules, picking the right keywords, and get your sites ranked.\n\n#The Early Days of Google \n\nThe idea for PageRank \u2014 Google\u2019s early ranking algorithm \u2014 stemmed from Einstein. Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote \u2014 the more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and rank them.\n\nThey realized that because of links, the Internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could use links. So they set about attempting to \u201cdownload\u201d (or crawl) the entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if you did a search for \u201cuniversity,\u201d they could look at the pages that talked about \u201cuniversity\u201d and rank them.\n\n#Google Today \n\nGoogle works largely the same way today, although with much more sophistication and nuance. For example, not all links carry the same weight. A link from an authoritative site (as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it) is much more valuable than a link from a non-authoritative site. A link from Wikipedia is probably worth about 10,000 links from sites that don\u2019t have much authority.\n\nAt the end of the day the purpose of Google is to find the \u201cbest\u201d (or most popular) web page for the words you type into the search bar.\n\nAll this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about, and then make it clear that we\u2019re popular. If we do that we win. In order to do that, we\u2019ll follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required.\n\n##Gaming the System \n\nGoogle is a very smart company. The sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible; bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around Silicon Valley powered by Google\u2019s algorithms.\n\nIf you get too far into the SEO rabbit hole you\u2019ll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process. Automated software like RankerX, GSA SER, and Scraperbox, instructions to create spam or spin content, linkwheels, PBNs, hacking domains, etc.\n\nSome of that stuff works very short term, but Google is smart and it is getting smarter. It gets harder to beat Google every day, and Google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day. Most don\u2019t even last a week before everything you\u2019ve done disappears and your work evaporates. That\u2019s not the way you should do things.\n\nInstead of Internet-based churn and burn we\u2019ll be focusing on building equity in the Internet. So if you see some highly-paid SEO consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links, or when you see some blackhatter beating the system, just know that it\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019re going to build authority and get traffic fast, but we\u2019re going to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t disappear or cripple your site in the future.\n\n#On-Page SEO \n\nThe first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to Google what our site is about.\n\nFor now we\u2019re going to focus our home page (our landing page) on ranking for one keyword that isn\u2019t our brand or company name. Once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape, but for now we\u2019ll stay laser focused.\n\nKeyword Research The first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is. Depending on how popular our site is and how long it\u2019s been around, the level of traffic and difficulty we\u2019ll get from this effort may vary.\n\n##The Long Tail \n\nThere\u2019s a concept we need to be familiar with known as the \u201clong tail.\u201d\n\nIf we were to graph \u201cpopularity\u201d of most things with \u201cpopularity\u201d being the Y axis and the rank order being the Y axis, we\u2019d get something like a power law graph:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BJTF2S1LVXK5ig75\n\nThere are some big hits that get the majority of attention, and after a few hits the graph falls sharply. The long-tail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller.\n\nThink of Amazon. They probably have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren\u2019t bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail.\n\nIn SEO this matters because, at least in the beginning, we\u2019re going to go after long tail keywords \u2014 very exact, intention-driven keywords with lower competition that we know can win, then gradually we\u2019ll work our way to the left.\n\nOur site isn\u2019t going to outrank ultra-competitive keywords in the beginning, but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort.\n\nThe keywords we\u2019re looking for we will refer to as \u201clong-tail keywords.\u201d\n\n#Finding the Long Tail \n\nIn order to find our perfect long-tail keywords, we\u2019re going to use a combination of four tools, all of which are free.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1. Use UberSuggest, KeywordShitter and a little bit of brainstorming to come up with some keywords\n\n2. Export those keywords to the Google Keyword Planner to estimate traffic level\n\n3. Search for those keywords with the SEOQuake chrome extension installed to analyze the true keyword difficulty\n\nDon\u2019t be intimidated \u2014 it\u2019s actually very simple. For this example we\u2019ll pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book (and we\u2019ll probably have to build out a site so you see if we\u2019re ranked there in a few months).\n\n##Step 1: Brainstorming and Keyword Generating \n\nIn this step we\u2019re simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work. Don\u2019t concentrate too much on culling the list at this point, as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process.\n\nSo since this is a book about growth hacking, I\u2019m going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit:\n\n- Growth hacking\n\n- Growth marketing\n\n- Internet marketing\n\n- Growth hacking guide\n\n- Growth hacking book\n\n- Book about growth hacking\n\n- What is growth hacking\n\n- Growth hacking instructions\n\nThat\u2019s a good enough list to start. If you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshitter.com. If you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes. Try to get a solid list of 5\u201310 to start with.\n\nNow we\u2019ll plug each keyword into UberSuggest. When I plug the first one \u2014 \u201cgrowth hacking\u201d \u2014 in, I get 246 results.\n\nClicking \u201cview as text\u201d will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list.\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BkT8uUYV3p2hsXCI.\n\nGo through that process with each keyword you came up with.\n\nNow we\u2019ll assume you have 500+ keywords. If you don\u2019t, try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword, and you\u2019ll have that many quickly. Ideally you\u2019ll have over 1500.\n\n##Step 2: Traffic Estimating \nNow that we have a pretty good list of keywords. Our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldn\u2019t do much for us. For example, my growth hacking list came up with \u201c5 internet marketing techniques.\u201d We probably won\u2019t go after that one, but instead of guessing we can let Google do the work for us. This will be our weeding out step.\n\n##Google Keyword Planner \n\nThe [Google Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) is a tool meant for advertisers, but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels.\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t make any promise of accuracy, so these numbers are likely only directionally correct, but they\u2019re enough to get us on the right track.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to have an AdWords account to be able to use the tool, but you can create one for free if you haven\u2019t use AdWords in the past.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve logged in, select \u201cGet search volume data and trends.\u201d\n\nPaste in your enormous list of keywords, and click \u201cGet search volume.\u201d Once you\u2019ve done so, you\u2019ll see a lot of graphs and data.\n\nUnfortunately the Keyword Planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within, so instead we\u2019re going to export our data to excel with the \u201cdownload\u201d button and play with it there.\n\nNow what we\u2019re going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after.\n\nThis varies a bit based on how much authority your site has. So let\u2019s try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank.\n\nGo to SEMrush.com and enter your URL, looking at the total backlinks in the third column:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aV3sF59d8Bt3Aqqw.\n\nAs a general rule (this may vary based on how old your site is, who the links are from, etc.), based on the number of links you have, this is the maximum level of \u201cdifficulty\u201d you should go after.\n\n**Number of Backlinks:Maximum Difficulty**\n\n\\&lt;30:40\n\n&lt;100:40\u201350\n\n&lt;1000:50\u201370\n\n1000+:70+\n\nGo ahead and sort the data by difficulty, and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get those keywords later). For now you can simply delete those rows.\n\n##Exact Match \n\nOne important thing to note is that Google gives us this volume as \u201cexact match\u201d volume. This means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms, but not if they are used in a phrase, so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall.\n\nNow with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest, and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit.\n\nHere are mine:\n\n- growth hacking strategies\n\n- growth hacking techniques\n\n- growth hacking 101\n\n- growth hacking instagram\n\n- growth hacking twitter\n\nMine all look the same, but that may not necessarily be the case.\n\n##Keyword Trends \n\nUnfortunately the \u201ckeyword difficulty\u201d that Google gives us is based on paid search traffic, not on natural search traffic.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s use [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/) to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously. You can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other. For my keywords it looks like this:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*10BiNkXI3C3mEvYb.\n\nThe ones I\u2019m most excited about are purple and red, which are \u201cGrowth hacking techniques\u201d and \u201cGrowth hacking Twitter.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019ll take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords.\n\n##Manual Keyword Difficulty Analysis \n\nIn order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword, we\u2019re going to have to look at the keywords manually, one by one. That\u2019s why we started by finding some long-tail keywords and narrowing the list.\n\nThis process gets a lot easier if you download the [SEOQuake Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seoquake/akdgnmcogleenhbclghghlkkdndkjdjc?hl=en). Once you\u2019ve done that, do a Google search and you\u2019ll notice a few changes.\n\nWith SEOQuake turned on the relevant SEO data of each site is displayed below each search result.\n\nWe\u2019re going to alter what is displayed, so in the left-hand sidebar click \u201cparameters\u201d and set them to the following:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qVN8Re6-d0RqvJ07.\n\nNow when you search, you\u2019ll see something like this:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9c46odS5ItXx3F5X.\n\nSEOQuake adds a ranking number, and the following at the bottom:\n\n**The Google Index:** This is how many pages from this base URL Google has indexed\n\n**Page Links:** The number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to SEMrush\u2019s index (usually very low compared to reality, but since we\u2019ll be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples)\n\n**URL Links:** The number of pages pointing to any page on the base URL\n\n**Age:** The first time the page was indexed by the Internet Archive\n\n**Traffic:** A very rough monthly traffic number for the base URL\n\nLooking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the weight of the indicators change. Not all links are from as good of sources, direct page links matter much more than URL links, etc., but if you google around and play with it for a while you\u2019ll get a pretty good idea of what it takes.\n\nIf you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one. If you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your on-page SEO in place. Generally it will be a mixture of both.\n\nKeep in mind that we\u2019re going to optimize our page for this exact keyword, so we have a bit of an advantage. That said, if you start to see pages from sites like Wikipedia, you will know it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\nHere are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things, starting with \u201cGrowth hacking techniques.\u201d\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YErpxe0guQCv8f2E.\n\nEntrepreneur.com is definitely a big name, and \u201cgrowth hacking techniques\u201d is in the title explicitly. This will be difficult to beat, but there are no links in the SEMRush index that point direct to the page.\n\n(By the way, I wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneur.com \u2014 I could probably do that and build a few links to that easily, even linking to my site in the article).\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hJxs4ukw38FD_rzA.\n\nYongfook.com, have never heard of that site. 206 total links, not much traffic, this one I could pass up. It does have quite a bit of age and \u201cGrowth hacking tactics\u201d in the title explicitly, so that would make it tough, but this one is doable to pass up after a while.\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FXNrc-YR8rEbVY90.\n\nAlright, so quicksprout is relatively popular, a lot of links, good age, lots of traffic, a few links direct to the page but not a ton.\n\n\nBut the word \u201ctactics\u201d doesn\u2019t even appear here. This page isn\u2019t optimized for this keyword, so I could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for \u201cgrowth hacking tactics.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page.\n\n17 total pages indexed? Created in 2014? No links in the index, even to the root URL? This one\u2019s mine. I should be able to front-page easily.\n\nSo this looks like a good keyword. Now we just have to get the on-page SEO in place and start building a few links.\n\n(Note: After doing this a few more times I learned that I could probably get austenallred.com toward the top of \"growth hacking press,\" so I changed the on-page optimization of one of those pages to focus on that keyword, and we'll see how it goes. \n\n#On-Page SEO \n\nNow that we have our keyword selected, we need to make sure Google knows what our site is about. This is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places. Most of this has to do with html tags, which make up the structure of a webpage. If you don\u2019t know html or understand how it works, just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you.\n\nHere is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized.\n\n## On-Page SEO Checklist \n\n\u2610 Your keyword is in the &lt;title&gt; tag, ideally at the front (or close to the front) of the tag\n\n\u2610 Your keyword is close to the beginning of the &lt;title&gt; tag (ideally the first words)\n\n\u2610 The title tag contains less than the viewable limit of 65 characters (optional but recommended)\n\n\u2610 Your keyword is in the first &lt;h1&gt; tag (and your page has an &lt;h1&gt; tag)\n\n\u2610 If your page contains additional header tags (&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc) your keyword or synonyms are in most of them\n\n\u2610 Any images on the page have an &lt;alt&gt; tag that contain your chosen keyword\n\n\u2610 Your keyword is in the meta description (and there is a meta description)\n\n\u2610 There is at least 300 words of text on the page\n\n\u2610 Your keyword appears in the URL (if not the homepage)\n\n\u2610 Your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy\n\n\u2610 Your keyword (or synonyms \u2014 Google recognizes them now) is used other times throughout the page\n\n\u2610 Your keyword density is between .5% and 2.5%\n\n\u2610 The page contains dofollow links to other pages (this just means you\u2019re not using nofollow links to every other page)\n\n\u2610 The page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site\n\nIf you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an on-page perspective. You\u2019ll likely be the best-optimized page for your chosen keyword unless you\u2019re in a very competitive space.\n\nAll we have left now is off-page optimization.\n\n#Off-Page SEO \n\nOff-Page SEO is just a fancy way to say links. (Sometimes we call them backlinks, but it\u2019s really the same thing.)\n\nGoogle looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote. If you link to something, in Google\u2019s eyes you\u2019re saying, \u201cThis is worth checking out.\u201d The more legit you are the more weight your vote carries.\n\n## Link Juice \n\nSEOs have a weird way to describe this voting process; they call it \u201clink juice.\u201d If an authoritative site, we\u2019ll say Wikipedia for example, links to you, they\u2019re passing you \u201clink juice.\u201d\n\nBut link juice doesn\u2019t only work site to site \u2014 if your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site, it passes link juice as well. For this reason our link structure becomes very important.\n\n### Checking Link Juice \n\nThere are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are. Unfortunately none of them are perfect \u2014 the only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages.\n\nGoogle crawls most popular pages several times per day, but they don\u2019t want you manipulating them, so they update their index pretty slowly.\n\nThat said, you can check at least a sample of Google\u2019s index in the Google Search Console (formerly known as Webmaster Tools). Once you navigate to your site, In the left-hand side select \u201cSearch Traffic\u201d then \u201cLinks to your site.\u201d There\u2019s a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links Google knows about (I\u2019m 99% convinced it\u2019s only a sample), but it\u2019s at least a representative sample.\n\nTo see all of your links, click on \u201cMore\u201d under \u201cWho links to you the most\u201d then \u201cDownload this table.\u201d This, again, seems to only download a sample of what Google knows about. You can also select \u201cDownload latest links\u201d which provides more recent links than the other option.\n\nUnfortunately this doesn\u2019t let us see much a to the value of the links, nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from.\n\nTo use those there are a wide variety of tools: If you have a budget I\u2019d go with ahrefs.com as they have the biggest index, followed by Moz\u2019s Open Site Explorer (most of the data you can get with a free account, if not then it\u2019s slightly cheaper than ahrefs), and finally SEMrush, which is free for most purposes we need. MajesticSEO uses a combination of \u201ctrust flow\u201d and \u201ccitation flow\u201d which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site.\n\nAll of these use different internal metrics to determine the \u201cauthority\u201d of a link, but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial.\n\n#Link Structure \n\nHTML links look something like this:\n\n&lt;a href=\u201dhttp://www.somesite.com\u201d title=\u201dkeyword\u201d&gt;Anchor text&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhere http://www.somesite.com is the place the link directs you to, the title is largely a remnant of time gone by, and the linked text \u2014 think the words that are blue and you click on \u2014 is called the \u201canchor text.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the amount of link juice a page has, the relevance of the anchor text matters.\n\nGenerally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible. External linking (from other sites) shouldn\u2019t be very heavily optimized for anchor text. If 90% of your links all have the same anchor text Google can throw a red flag, assuming that you\u2019re doing something fishy.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever creating links (like we\u2019ll show you in the future) I only ever use something generic like the site name, \u201chere\u201d or the full URL.\n\n## Internal Structure \n\nGenerally speaking you don\u2019t want orphan pages (those that aren\u2019t linked to by other pages), nor do you want an overly-messy link structure.\n\nSome say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tWHFIzBzG7zq6uii.\n\nThat\u2019s close, but it gets a couple things wrong. First, you\u2019ll never have a structure that organized, and second, in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level. This can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or \u201crecommended\u201d pages. That allows you to specify anchor text, and pass link juice freely from page to page.\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess, so you\u2019ll just have to imagine what that actually looks like.\n\nWe have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site.\n\n###Robots.txt, disavow, nofollow, and other minutia### \n\nMost of SEO at this point is now managing stuff that can go wrong. There is a lot of that, but we\u2019ll go over what will cover 99% of needs, and you can Google if there\u2019s something really crazy.\n\n#### Robots.txt\n\nAlmost every site has a page at url.com/robots.txt \u2014 even google has one.\n\nThis is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl. Most are pretty good about listening, except the Bingbot, which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it. (I\u2019m mostly kidding.)\n\nIf you don\u2019t want Google to crawl a page (maybe it\u2019s a login page you don\u2019t want indexed, a landing page, etc.) you can just \u201cdisallow\u201d it in your robots.txt by saying disallow: /somepage.\n\nIf you add a trailing / to it (e.g. disallow: /somepage/) it will also disallow all child pages.\n\nTechnically you can specify different rules for different bots (or user agents), but it\u2019s easiest to start your file with \u201cUser-agent: *\u201d if you don\u2019t have a need for separate crawling rules.\n\n#### Disavow\n\nGoogle will penalize spammy sites, and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors. Say, for example, you wanted to take out a competitor. You could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized. This is called \u201cnegative SEO,\u201d and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords. Google generally tries to pretend like it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIn the case that this does happen, however, you can \u201cDisavow\u201d links in the Search Console, which is pretty much saying, \u201cHey Google, don\u2019t count this one.\u201d I hope you\u2019ll never have to use it, but if you hire (or have hired) a bad SEO or are being attacked by a competitor, that is how you combat it.\n\n#### Nofollow\n\nA link can have a property called \u201cnofollow\u201d such as this:\n\n&lt;a href=\u201dhttp://www.somesite.com\u201d title=\u201dkeyword\u201d rel=\u201dnofollow\u201d&gt;Anchor text&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nIf you want to link to somebody but you don\u2019t want it to count as a vote (you don\u2019t want to pass link-juice), or you support user-generated content and want to deter spammers, you can use a nofollow link. Google says it discounts the value of those links. I\u2019m not convinced they discount them heavily, but other SEOs are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else.\n\n#### Redirects\n\nIf you\u2019re going to change a URL, but you don\u2019t want its link juice to disappear, you can use a 301 redirect. A 301 will pass a majority of the link juice.\n\nImportantly, Google views www.austenallred.com and austenallred.com as different sites. So decide on one, and redirect all of one type to the other.\n\n#### Canonical URLs\n\nIf you have two pages that are virtually the same, you can add something like &lt;link rel=\u201dcanonical href=\u201dhttps://www.someurl.com/somepage\u201d&gt; to say \u201chey, treat this page as if it were that page instead, but I don\u2019t want to 301 it.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019re ready to build our first links.\n\n# Link Building\n\n Link building is where SEO really starts to matter, and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt.\n\nThe best way to build links is to not build links. I\u2019ve worked for companies in the past that don\u2019t have to ask for them, they just flow in from press, customer blogs, their awesome blog posts, etc. If this is an option (and we\u2019ll go over a couple of ways to make it more likely) you\u2019re in a great place.\n\nIf not, at least in the beginning, we\u2019re going to manually create just a few.\n\nWe\u2019re going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in India to do so. That is a recipe for disaster, and I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve seen that take down a site.\n\nWeb 2.0s The easiest way to build high quality links are what SEOs call \u201cweb 2.0s.\u201d That\u2019s just a way to say \u201csocial sites\u201d or sites that let you post stuff. Now tweeting a link into the abyss won\u2019t do you anything, but profiles, status pages, etc. do carry some weight. And if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link.\n\nSome of the easiest are:\n\n- Twitter (in your bio)\n\n- Github (the readme of a repo)\n\n- YouTube (the description of a video \u2014 it has to actually get views)\n\n- Wordpress (yes, you\u2019ll have to actually create a blog)\n\n- Blogger (same here)\n\n- Tumblr\n\n- Upvote-based sites (HackerNews, GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, Reddit, etc.)\n\nIf nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links. There are always big lists of \u201cweb 2.0s\u201d you can find online, but keep in mind if you\u2019re going to build something out on a blogging platform you\u2019re going to have to really build something out. That\u2019s a lot of content and time, but you have to do it the right way.\n\nWe generally keep a bigger list of Web 2.0s here. Some may be out of date, but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen Web 2.0s anyway.\n\n## Expired Domains \n\nAnother way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain. This is more difficult to do, but there are a lot of options such as expireddomains.net. (Google \u201cexpired domains\u201d and you\u2019ll find dozens of sites monitoring them.)\n\nYou\u2019ll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself.\n\n## Link Intersection \n\nAnother way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool. These find sites that link to \u201ccompetitor a\u201d and \u201ccompetitor b\u201d but not to you. Theoretically, if they link to both of your competitors, they should be willing to link to you. Moz, Ahrefs, LunaMetrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well.\n\nNow that we have a few basic links flowing, we\u2019re going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press, eventually getting to a point where we don\u2019t have to build any more links.\n\n# Your First Drip of Traffic \u2014 Becoming an Authority Site \n\nAwesome \u2014 you have a site that converts well, your SEO is in place, ready for you to drive traffic. Now what?\n\nAs you\u2019re probably learned at this point, a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic.\n\nWe\u2019re going to fix that.\n\nThis section takes a lot of time and effort, and in the beginning you\u2019ll likely wonder if you\u2019re doing anything at all. Remember that class in college that is so difficult it\u2019s the point where most people give up, effectively weeding out the people who aren\u2019t ready to major in a specific subject?\n\n### Well this is the weeder-out chapter of growth hacking. ###\n\nTake a Long-Term View The reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time \u2014 losing weight, investing in a 401(k), etc. In the beginning you\u2019re going to have a little seedling of traffic, and you\u2019ll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees, thinking, \u201cI must be doing something wrong.\u201d You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. The traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re a startup. Our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable (meaning we won\u2019t die before we start to see the rewards), but at the same time we\u2019re building equity in the Internet.\n\nThe type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away. We want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years. Combining hundreds (or thousands) of little trickles, our site that converts, and a great product we will create a giant river.\n\nFuture chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from, so in this chapter we\u2019re going to focus on traffic that\u2019s network-agnostic. Traffic that we can\u2019t get by tapping any specific network.\n\nJust to give you some idea of scale, I\u2019ve seen this process drive over 500,000 visits per day, though the build up to that level took almost a full year. What could you do with 500,000 visits per day?\n\n##Monitoring Alerts \n\nTo start we\u2019re going to use the keywords we found in the SEO chapter, and inject ourselves (and our company) into the conversation wherever it\u2019s taking place.\n\nTo do this we\u2019re going to use software called BuzzBundle.\n\nBuzzBundle This software lets us do a few things:\n\nConstantly monitor all mentions of a specific topic, competitor, or keyword across multiple locations on the Internet (from Facebook groups to Quora questions to blog posts) where comments are available\nAllow us to leave a constructive comment that references our product or company\n\nDisclaimer: This is not the SEO comment spam you\u2019ve seen This step takes thought, effort, and a real human who understands what they\u2019re typing. I don\u2019t often say this, but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy. If you\u2019re trying to replicate the automated SEO spam you\u2019ve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work, but you\u2019ll get banned, your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be, and you\u2019ll be banned\n\n## Productive Commenting \n\nWe\u2019re not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us SEO traffic. Our comments must do two things:\n\n- Be contextual. We are only going to talk about the topic presented in an article or tweet, and only mention our company when it naturally fits in\n\n- Contribute to the conversation. I should learn something or have value added to my life by reading your comment\n\nIf you do these two things a few changes will take place: First, you\u2019ll notice that people click on your links because you\u2019re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. Second, people will respect your company because you\u2019re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute.\n\nAnd with that disclaimer, we\u2019ll move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done. Let\u2019s fire up BuzzBundle and get to work.\n\n## Accounts and Personas \n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to do in BuzzBundle is go to Accounts -&gt; Add new accounts. This is the starting point for everything we\u2019ll do, as we need accounts to comment.\n\nOne thing you\u2019ll notice about BuzzBundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts. I find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view, but I don\u2019t want to go too far overboard and be spammy.\n\nI\u2019d recommend doing something simple \u2014 create 2\u20133 personas, each of whom you identify with (or are you), and enter them into your BuzzBundle accounts.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t even change my name, I just use a different one (eg. Austen J. Allred vs. Austen Allred) or use a few photos, just so it isn\u2019t literally the same name and same photo blanketing the Internet.\n\n#### Disqus \n\nDisqus is a comment system used all over the place, and it carries some caveates. Disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post, so there are two workarounds:\n\nUse a lot of different accounts, rotating IPs or using a proxy every two days or so\nUse your site URL as your \u201cdisplay name\u201d\n\nBoth of these work, but the second one is much easier in my view.\n\n## UTM Parameters \n\nUsing links with our UTM parameters here will be very beneficial. We\u2019ll be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site, and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic.\n\nLink Shorteners If you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted, it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some 301 redirects.\n\nTo keep it simple you can use a link shortener that 301s such as bit.ly, or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and 301 the traffic from a certain page to your money site.\n\n##Using BuzzBundle \n\nLet\u2019s get started with the BuzzBundle.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s going to ask you for a keyword. We already have a keyword from the SEO section, but we may want to do something even a bit more generic. For this one I\u2019m going to go with \u201cgrowth hacking.\u201d\n\nSimply hit \u201cgo\u201d and let BuzzBundle get started.\n\nIt will load different content types into different columns, but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to.\n\nThe first thing I clicked on was this:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FtoN2kYmo5y3Oc1w.\n\nIt\u2019s a review of another book about growth hacking. All I had to do was comment, tag the author, ask him if he were willing to review our book, and offer to send him one for free. (If you\u2019re that person reading this now it\u2019s going to be pretty awkward).\n\nMy assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic, because it is. When you're authentically reaching out to people you get rid of all of the icky-ickyThe fact that there\u2019s now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus.\n\nAs an aside, I much prefer to hold \u201cshift\u201d and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if I\u2019m just going to be commenting as myself.\n\nThe next one I found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week.\n\nI left the following comment:\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m-1C10p2aY9Ymjjz.\n\nNote how I followed him on Twitter so that it\u2019s obviously personal and not an automated spam comment. I even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks.\n\nThat is how you get people on your team.\n\nAs you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response, I\u2019d recommend starting to sort by reach, ramping up the number of keywords you\u2019re searching for, and possibly even -gasp- upgrading to the paid version of BuzzBundle.",

Too many clients let ego or gut feeling lead them. \n\nYour conversion rate dictates the bid price of your keyword for the most part. Don't optimise to ad rank, it's a stupid way to burn your money. You might think you should be number 1 for your best seller, but if your conversion rate can't support it you can't effectively bid for it.\n\nAlso don't land anyone on a page they can't convert on Immediately. You'll seriously damage your conversion rate. \n\nIf you want SEO links, you need PR. The agency I work for sells PR and SEO combined and the effects can be huge. I've seen several of our PR stunts hit front page here and people have no clue that it's a PR agency and not the client themselves.

Business owners who actually own a real life, living, breathing business would never waste their time trying to learn how to adapt and apply all of this to their vertical - much less business owners who are just trying to get revenue rolling. No matter what, organic rankings that result in actual revenue for a company take time to achieve. If you just started a business go join the chamber and connect with people, always carry a business card, and always give stellar service. That is how you will get a budget for doing what is written here.",

Spot on.\n\nHOWEVER, for a busy business owner, this further proves **why you should** hire someone to manage your SEO. At least if you highly value your precious hours of the day... Just the task of sitting down and reading this guide is simply too much for some business owners. \n\nFrom personal experience working directly with plenty of them, I can say a majority are too busy to even read an email more than a few lines, let alone implement a solid, properly executed SEO strategy on their own.\n\nI could just as easily read a guide on how to change my car's oil myself and likely the process will turn out to be rather 'easy'. The reason I don't is because a) I value my time more than the cost of getting it done at a shop and b) having the eyes of a professional overseeing it can end up identifying issues I wouldn't have known to look for on my own. I just recently had an instance where during a routine oil change they found that my power steering line had a leak. If had done it on my own, I probably wouldn't have noticed because I'm not very well versed (let alone professionally trained) in every other aspect of car maintenance.\n\nAll the same can be said for SEO.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, this is GREAT info for anyone getting into SEO. I not only upvoted, but also saved this post. I just wanted to share my thoughts (from experience) on why I wouldn't necessarily say *SEO is easy* or that business owners should *never* consider hiring an expert.",

If you just had crawled the web, how would you index all those pages?  Of course, you'd count keywords, judge the importance of the keywords by title or H1 placement, measure quality by backlinks, etc.  All the stuff in these SEO articles. \n\nThe single biggest change google has ever made is when they switched from just displaying a page full of links to making the links redirects through google and displaying snippets from the target web page.  This is the new google.\n\nGoogles rankings are now largely based on user's feedback.  They know what people type in the search box, and they know what people click on in the results.  If the number #1 ranking is getting fewer clicks (based on the page title and snippet displayed) then the #2 ranking, Google is going to swap the two.\n\nSimilarly, if your website is on page 6 and it gets way more clicks then expected, you are going to move up.\n\nUsers base their clicks on what they see.  The title, the URL, and the snippet.  That's all that needs to be optimized.\n\nAny SEO article that fails to mention this fact, is missing the most important part of google.\n\nAlso, this is the reason that Bing, Cuil, Blekko, etc can't compete with google.  It's not the algorithm anymore, it's user feedback.  Google has a hundred times the feedback that any other search engine gets.  Their results are just going to be better.\n",

Don't promise what you can't deliver, unless you want to open yourself up to a lawsuit.

The field is littered with \"experts\" who don't know a god damn thing, or think they're pros because they got Bob's auto repair to rank locally in a small town of 300 people.

As such, there really are no guarantees. The best every competent SEO person I've know (and I've known many) is often willing to offer is overall improvement in organic results and conversions, but nothing they will contractually guarantee.\n\nTheir job takes lots of time and effort up front, and there is ultimately no guarantee for them that Google won't change their algorithm, etc. Just find a calendar of Google updates to see how frequently that happens. As such, I think the fair compromise that they settle on is, you pay fees, and after a period of time if things don't improve, you part ways.

This was the 3rd SEO we hired after the prior 2 did virtually nothing but tweak each other's on page work. I warned of the difficulty, he charged an outrageous sum and promised results, and we sued to get it back because we weren't going to be scammed for a 3rd time.\n\nThis is why I hate this field, and I used to do SEO back around 2004 - 2008. It's far too arcane, and no one will stand behind what they do. Even for marketing, I can't think of another profession where people are content to deliver nothing at all.\n\nI now tell other business owners to try other more measurable marketing efforts first, things where you are likely to get somewhere, get an ROI, and not have some \"expert\" consultant duck out of the job because it turns out his work made no difference. It's one thing for traffic to not increase. Ok. Maybe the keywords were wrong. But your job is to improve keyword rankings. That's your job. And so many SEOs aren't capable of doing their job.",

They would never allow us to enter a contract where we were liable to that extent even though they had an insane track record of delivering results.\n\nI'm sure there were unique circumstances here, but frankly if you got burned several times outsourcing, you should probably have taken it in-house at that point, laid the foundation with your past experience, and been jointly accountable for the results to ensure your expectations were realistic.",

It isn't my responsibility nor any other company to basically know everything about the work a contractor performs just to ensure they aren't a fraud. That isn't how contracting works.

You state: \n&gt;You\u2019ll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself.\n\nThis is highly unethical and can get you in a lot of legal problems. If you restore a page from archive you are taking another persons work and presenting it as your own for financial gain. The domain may be open but the contents of that domain are the work of someone else. You cannot re-host this content as if you were the owner. That page design belongs to me regardless of being active. That artwork belongs to me regardless of being active. That content belongs to me regardless of being active.\n\nTo be blunt; If I catch you doing this with content I have created I am going to come after you. At the least I am going to get your page shut down by the host under DCMA. At the most I am going to take you to court for copyright infringement. \n\nYou did a great job explaining how Google indexes pages but have also managed to confirm some of the most nasty elements of SEO. \n\nI am a little shocked at the acceptance of this practice I have seen in the comments here. \n\n**TLDR; Doing business in a legal and ethical way should be important to us all.** ",

            "comment": "Great post! I used to work as a search engine evaluator and I wanted to add a few things that aren't mainstream tips but can make a difference.\n\nFirst, if you're selling something, make sure you have a contact page with real contact information. One of the tasks I performed was looking at web stores and determining if they looked legitimate. If no contact information was found and very little information was found about the website online (hint: get verified on Reseller Ratings and related websites as soon as they allow you to), it was docked in the ratings. This is especially true if the website was recently created and has private Whois info. It's fine to care about your privacy but make sure you have that contact page. It provides vital legitimacy for your business.\n\nSecond, if you have a blog, write for people first. Provide useful content and don't waste the rest of your page on ads for your stuff. You want the vast majority of your web page to be \"main content\" that is useful to the reader. Then you want some \"supplementary content\" that provides additional information. Supplementary content is primarily links to additional content and also includes navigation links. And then you can have small amounts of advertising.\n\nFinally, optimize your website so it loads quickly, especially on mobile devices. If your website takes several seconds to load, not only are you going to lose customers who get frustrated and click the back button but Google (and other search engines) may lower your search engine ranking.  Google has been using speed as a factor in search engine ranking [since 2010](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html) and I'm sure they have only increased the impact since then.",

If Google doesn't detect this today, be sure that it will detect this at some later point.\n\n2. Talking of using proxies to fool Disqus.  Again, attempt at fooling the legitimate player; doing that just leads to a cat-and-mouse game.\n\nThe rest is decent.  I'm skeptical of the amount of keyword stuffing you're recommending, but I haven't tried this out in practice so it may be that that is OK for uncommon keywords.\n\n\nThere are also numerous other factors you may want to optimize; e.g. Google ranks based on [page loading speed](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html).",

Any reason why this is so far off on semrush? Also, im only seeing low level backlinks being listed. I have some decent sized blogs pointing to my website with multiple articles and it's been that way for some time now and still they don't show up. I only see posts I've made on my own in forums and stuff any reason why blog posts don't show on semrush?

I use OpenCart not Shopify though so I have no idea if there is customer IP tracking on Shopify. You'd have to look into that and Google the IPs that show up. Otherwise you can use a robots.txt and removes some of the bull crap bots you don't care about like Baidu, but that also isn't something you necessarily want to do unless you are experienced. The easiest answer is simply Analytics.",

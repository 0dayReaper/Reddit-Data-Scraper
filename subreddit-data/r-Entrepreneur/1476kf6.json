    "postText": "If you could ask an accountant anything what would it be?\n\nI am getting ready to really focus on the Youtube channel for my accounting firm in an effort to monetize it and create an additional source of revenue for the firm.  As part of that I am wanting to open up the channel to answering questions for small business owners.\n\nSo if you have a question you would like to ask an accountant please feel free to post it below.  If it matches our skillset and I feel like it would benefit our channel I'll answer it in a video and link it in a response.\n\nTo be transparent: this is very much to grow our channel.  We do not generally work for free and I'm offering this as a way to drive traffic to our channel with hopes of monetizing it.  I want to be extremely open about what I'm doing here.  We cannot provide free services for businesses beyond our Youtube channel and responses will be linked as a Youtube video so this isn't like a normal AMA. \n\nGuidelines: Questions should be about US taxes and/or US accounting/bookkeeping.  We do not do international taxes and I am not going to be answering state specific questions right now.  This is not in any way meant to replace services from a professional.  This is meant provide clarity around concepts/regulations and provide general information.  Without knowing the details of your business there may be nuances I am not aware of and that prevent me from providing complete guidance.  The answers provided are general information - not meant to be applied directly to your business without additional research and guidance from a professional.  Please do not post copies of any notices or anything that has sensitive information. \n\nAbout My Firm and Myself: My firm specializes in helping small businesses with taxes and accounting/bookkeeping.  We work with businesses doing 5 figures a year up to 9 figures a year in a variety of capacities from tax prep to all inclusive outsourced CFO, bookkeeping, tax, etc.  I am a licensed Enrolled Agent (federal license from the IRS) and hold a bachelors and masters in accounting.  My specialization is in tax planning and tax representation for small businesses.  My favorite thing about my firm is the people we get to meet and help.  I absolutely love working with the group of clients and businesses we have.\n\nI'll start answering questions this week.",

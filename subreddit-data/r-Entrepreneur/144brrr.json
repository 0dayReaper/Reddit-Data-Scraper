    "postText": "Wantrepreneur thinking of starting a service-based business?\n\nAlready a well-established business serving a solid customer/client base?\n\nIf we are to believe the futurists, within the lifetimes of most of you reading this (and probably in about 10 - 15 years absolute max), AI will kill your job and your business.\n\nThen what will you do?\n\nYour existing and future/potential clients will turn to AI to do a job far, far quicker and simpler job than a human can do (and just as efficient and high-quality, if not more so). Sorry, you're no longer needed.\n\nMost white collar/service jobs and businesses will be redundant and no longer needed because AI will be doing them. Even some blue collar manual jobs are threatened.\n\nWhat are we going to do with our time and our lives? How will we make money? How will we aspire? How will humans gain money? How will we be able to foster ambition and aspiration if good jobs and businesses don't exist (because they're taken over by AI)?\n\nUniversal Basic Income is perhaps the answer.....BUT ....you cannot surely say someone can get more UBI than someone else....everyone would have to have the same amount of UBI (maybe if you have a family you can receive more than a single person with no kids).\n\nWith business and the commercial world having been killed by AI and hardly any jobs, careers and businesses to be filled by humans, what will we....what will YOU....do?\n\nWith free markets and open competition all but gone (as most human businesses will be dead), how and what will be able to allow people to \"make it\" or have more money than others?\n\nWill AI be the communists/Marxists' wet dream? Will it make everyone poorer and kill off most high wages/salaries?\n\nDoes AI terrify you? Do you worry that your job and your livelihood....which, for many entrepreneurs, we enjoy so much and are passionate about....  will be made redundant by AI?",

These companies will use AI as a tool for everything from services to manufacturing, with their bottom line in mind.\n\nThe twist to this is that the way these companies make money is through customers/consumers. There might be some roundabout exceptions like those that only do government contracts, etc, but governments make their money from the general population, and ultimately, the money always comes from the people.\n\n I know that's a really drawn-out way to state the obvious, but my point is that if ai replaces everybody and nobody is making money, then unless there is some enormous and cataclysmic system change, the companies that utilize all this ai will not have any potential for a customer base.  \n\nWhile corporations naturally want to make as much money as possible while losing as little, it is ultimately in their best interest for their customers to also make as much money as possible. \n\nIn the end, if AI is fully incorporated into daily life, I believe maintaining a healthy balance of AI driven tools and human power will be important part of making business. This might happen naturally through changes of economy or via government regulation, but I do think it would happen in this scenario.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. I would like some help with making the following decision.\n\nI'm starting a consulting business that helps dentists get more patients using FB/IG ads. Because I'm new to copywriting, I'm struggling to write an ad copy that I can be confident that it will work and get people to book a consultation with my clients.\n\nI wrote 4 copies that I plan to use but deep down I'm afraid to use them because I treat my client's money as my money and I'm not 100% confident to spend their money on what I've built.\n\nI know that I can read some books about copywriting and become better but this would take a lot of time and I think that the right way to do it is to do the work and learn as you do it.\n\nI would really appreciate for anyone to tell me how to think about this situation and hopefully make the right decision.\n\nThanks!",

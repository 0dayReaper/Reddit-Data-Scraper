    "postText": "We had a really cool conversation with Ryan DeLuca, co-founder and CEO of Bodybuilding.com. Some of the interesting topics we touched on included:\n\n1. What started as selling creatine from Ryan's garage, turned into the biggest online supplement store worldwide\n2. SEO strategies during the internet boom: product ratings, day-to-day videos, bodyspace, and online forums, were all key innovations at the time\n3. The Cold Start problem: how do you create something from nothing and light a fire within the community \n4. Doing things that don't scale: showing up at small community events and supporting athletes\n5. BlackBox VR: building a modern gym in the MetaVerse \n\nIf you're interested in checking out the full conversation, please have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpe74Sw0HY&amp;t=225s).",

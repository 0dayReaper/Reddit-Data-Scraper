    "postText": "The ride\u2019s over.  For better or worse the refinancing industry has disappeared. But now I can talk about this story publicly without worrying about someone competing with me.\n\nAs for my background, I immigrated to the US as a kid. I'm not a professional software developer. Nor do I have a CS degree. In fact, I flunked out of the one CS class I did take in college. But I do enjoy coding.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, I started to organize coworking with friends.  Well one day I\u2019m at my good friend's house. Drew.  Except I can\u2019t focus because this guy doesn\u2019t get off the phone. Like ever. I ask how many calls he makes in a day? He replies back 300 to 400.\n\nHis job? Well turns out he\u2019s the guy that won\u2019t leave you alone about refinancing your house.  What a job. He hates it.\n\nTo really rub salt in the wound, after every call he has to click a bunch of things in his CRM to log that no one (probably) answered. Takes him about 20 seconds. Not that bad? Well he does that 300 times a day.\n\nCan the CRM streamline the process I ask? Nope. That\u2019s when my idea hit. This can be automated.\n\nIn about 3 hours I hacked together a python script that would click certain parts of the screen when you hit Ctrl + K. It\u2019s finicky but Drew\u2019s ecstatic.\n\nWithin a few days Drew tells me he\u2019s been making more calls than 95% of his coworkers. That's 100 people. In fact his boss even publicly commended him at their all-hands meeting.\n\nThat\u2019s impressive.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. They pay Drew $40k a year. At his company alone, there\u2019s 100 other people doing the exact same job. They all have this problem. Hours a day of clicking the  same pointless buttons. By my math, that\u2019s costing the company almost 1M a year. That\u2019s a lot of money.\n\nWhat if I sold my script? Well for one it\u2019s buggy. Every now and then the timing gets thrown off and it\u2019ll click the wrong button.  Not to mention getting employees to install Python is a non-starter.  I realize this isn\u2019t sellable.\n\nBut theoretically a chrome extension could inject code directly into the webpage leading to 0 bugs and a way easier deployment story. I\u2019ve never built a chrome extension though.\n\nAlas the internet.  I spend a couple weeks doing almost nothing at work and coding away. It took a little trial and error but eventually I managed to scrape an extension together.\n\nFor the website, I buy a template and make a few tweaks. It looks clean. Like really clean.\n\nNow I just have to figure out how to sell this thing. I figure I\u2019ll send out 500 LinkedIn pitches and wait for responses.  You know how many people end up responding? Zero.\n\nWell it was worth a shot. I have no connections and there\u2019s probably way better solutions out there anyways. I table the idea.\n\nA month later I get a form submission on my website.  I check it and to my utter shock it's a real person.\n\nI called Drew and pitched him joining me as my cofounder, he\u2019s always been good with people and knows the industry.  He accepts. We set up an introductory sales call.  Turns out this prospect has 30 people doing Drew\u2019s *exact* job. How did he find out about us? His answer - a youtube video I posted as the tutorial.\n\nI give him a couple free license keys and he\u2019s off running. The extension\u2019s a little buggy so it takes a *lot* of troubleshooting calls to get it working. To my complete surprise, this doesn\u2019t bother him one bit. I finally understand what product market fit feels like.\n\nWhen we do get it running he\u2019s ecstatic. Within a month he signs a year long contract for 25 licenses.  That\u2019s 18k a year.\n\nOver the course of a few months we have more inbound leads come in. We sign more contracts. I handle all this while working my full time job. Our extension only does one thing and it does it really well.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 2 years.  With the fed hiking interest rates, refinancing companies have entered hibernation. Unfortunately this means our business is dead. But I still can\u2019t believe what we accomplished. My total expenses? A couple hundred in server fees.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWell hopefully you enjoyed the story. But I'd also love it if you gave me some feedback on my latest project, [ReplyFaster](https://www.replyfaster.io/). Try downloading it and let me know what you think. If you have questions with either, I'm an open book.",

People just want their problems solved.  The more painful the problem, the easier it is.  Product market truly feels like you\u2019re rolling a boulder downhill.",

If you make millions off of it somehow as a start then please come back and give me $20,000(it's time for me to start thinking about a new car, hehe)\n\nI got my current job a little over 4 yrs ago, I never ever remember working with computers/electronics so much in my life at all than at this job.  This means I see all the compounded garbage of stacking software programs and updates through time.... Nobody has time for that, and even in my personal life I am trying to trim computers out to a certain degree....\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because the internet is not that old still.... I am working on my own e-commerce idea and for an actual website idea I am thinking of a very basic simplistic website.  And that idea is to step back about 17 yrs and literally make a website that is very simple and basic like years ago.  I found myself getting tired of online shopping and WAY TOO MANY choices with nothing but a mouse button to click( just had a bad experience with Home Depot online shopping too)... The \"buy and then return item\" model is getting old very fast too, so I want to get back to basic templates but dress them up a little to slightly put a new twist to a basic template.  Unfortunately with trauma in my background I missed a chunk of the electronic movement(just give me a rotary dial cell phone, they make one now) so I never kept up with the electronic trends too much over the past 15 yrs....\n\nI think there's a start of an idea here to get back to the basics of internet..... I wouldn't know how to get it kick started and rolling though",

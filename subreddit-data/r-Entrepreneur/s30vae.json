    "postText": "I've been wanting to publish more content on my site. So I decided to hire a writer to help.\n\nIt turns out that there are tons of places to hire writers online:\n\n* Freelance marketplaces like Upwork.\n* Content mills like Textbroker.\n* Higher-priced content services and agencies.\n* And plenty of job boards for writers.\n\nSo I thought:\n\nWhy not waste a bunch of money and turn this into a big experiment?\n\nSo I tested 17 different websites for hiring writers and outsourcing content. I spent an embarrassing amount of money. And by the end of it, I'd reviewed 359 articles from hundreds of writers.\n\nThe results were a **minefield**.\n\n* 34% of the articles were plagiarized or \"spun\" (stolen, but with slight tweaks to make it harder to catch).\n* 18% were AI-written nonsense.\n* And many writers included irrelevant links to low-quality sites. Probably in order to charge other clients for link-building services.\n\nSurprisingly, these issues came up at practically every pricing tier. Whether the fee was under $0.01/word or over $0.50.\n\nWhether through a job board, a freelance platform or a content-writing service.\n\nSome sites even reinforced bad behavior.\n\nFor example, I wouldn't recommend any site that offers article spinning as a service.\n\nOr any platform that lets writers hide unfavorable client reviews. (I'm looking at you, Verblio. *Both* Verblio writers I tested sent me plagiarized articles.)\n\nLuckily, a few sites were much, much better.\n\nHere were my favorites:\n\n**Best writing service: Express Writers** (expresswriters.com)  \nIt's more expensive than a content mill \u2014 but a bargain for the quality.\n\n$600 got me a 2k-word article at their \"authority content\" tier.\n\nIt was clear and concise. Well-structured and well-researched. And backed up with good examples and links to relevant resources. I gave it a 4 out of 5 for content quality.\n\n**Best inexpensive and fast writers: WriterAccess** (writeraccess.com)\n\nAt $0.15 per word for their most expensive tier, I didn't expect WriterAccess to be very good.\n\nIt isn't as good as Express Writers. But it might have the best price-to-quality ratio of any option out there. I gave it a 3.5 out of 5 for writing quality.\n\nAnd it only took 4 days to get a 1,600-word article.\n\n**Best budget content mill: iWriter** (iwriter.com)\n\niWriter's pricing ranges from under $0.01 to $0.07 per word.\n\nI spent $145 for a 2k-word blog post.\n\nThe writing won't blow your socks off.\n\nBut from my testing, the quality coming out of iWriter beats every other budget content mill.\n\nI only gave it at 1.5 out of 5 for writing quality. But that's good enough for low-competition affiliate blogs. Or anyone who thinks quantity &gt; quality.\n\n**Best writing jobs board: ProBlogger Jobs** (problogger.com/jobs)\n\nI bet half the pro writers in the world have applied to jobs on ProBlogger.\n\nYou can use it to find freelancers for one-off or ongoing projects. Or to recruit full-timers.\n\nA $75 job listing gets you dozens and dozens of applicants. If not 100+.\n\nAlternatively, another great \u2014 and free \u2014 writing job board is the r/HireaWriter subreddit.\n\nMy listing there brought me 85 applications within a week.\n\nWhen using any job board, I recommend setting up a Google Form for your application process instead of using their application management system. (Because when you're dealing with that many applicants, you need to be able to quickly glance through them.)\n\n**Best freelance platform: Upwork** (upwork.com)\n\nThe haters are wrong. I've hired 60 Upwork freelancers over the years.\n\nBut with so many low-quality freelancers there, it can be like finding a needle in a haystack. The key is having the right hiring process. Otherwise you'll waste a lot of time.\n\nFor this experiment, I hired two different writers on Upwork. One interesting thing about Upwork is that you don't always get what you pay for.\n\nThe first writer charged me $0.40/word, and I would give her writing quality a 2 out of 5. Not good.\n\nThe second writer charged $0.10/word, and his writing was a 3.5 out of 5. Pretty decent! Good enough for most blogs, and great for the price.\n\n(Note: People Per Hour is a good alternative to Upwork if you don't mind British English. But I don't recommend their Fiverr-style individual services. Just stick to the freelance marketplace side.)\n\nIf you're curious, I also published lots more details about my experience with all 17 sites in a [blog post yesterday.](https://growthbadger.com/hire-a-writer/) (It's just a blog post, no email address required or anything.)\n\nThat post includes:\n\n* A job post template\n* The strengths of content services vs freelance sites vs writing job boards\n* What to include in your Google Forms application form, and why to use one\n* And a hiring process that filters out plagiarizers and bad applicants, so you don't have to waste as much money as I did. \ud83e\udd2a\n\nPlus more detailed reviews of all 17 sites, with writing excerpts of the work I received.",

Some other folks have chimed in to say that most content services take a large chunk of the cut. So if you wanted to work for one of those, I would definitely go for a more expensive one like Express Writers.\n\nBut even Express Writers only charges \\~$0.30 per word for their most expensive blog content tier. Which includes graphics and editorial review and keyword research. So as a writer you might only get, I don't know, less than half of that?\n\nI think as a writer, you're probably facing this continuum:\n\n**Content services and mills**: the least pay, but the easiest to get clients.\n\n**Freelance platforms**: more pay but somewhat harder to get clients.\n\n**Job boards**: maybe even more pay (but not always). And again harder to get clients.\n\n**Inbound** (meaning, people reaching out to you because of your activity on social media, personal brand, personal website, or portfolio of credited work): the most pay, but the hardest. These are the only types of folks who can reliably charge $1+ per word from what I've seen.\n\nAnd to add another layer\u2026\n\nThe more technical or specific subject-matter expertise you have, the more you can charge. It probably makes getting clients harder at first because you narrow your scope, but over time it actually might make it easier to get clients if you get known for doing that one thing and get referrals.\n\nFor example, good legal writers, medical writers, technical writers etc. might be able to easily charge over $0.50 or $1/word. (Not that they ALL can, but I would guess that experienced ones can.)\n\nConversion copywriters, script writers, etc. also tend to charge much more than general content writers / blog writers. At least per word \u2014 but it probably takes longer for them to write too.\n\nConversion copywriters also have the benefit of being \"closer to the money.\" Someone who writes landing pages or ad copy can directly tie it to revenue and demonstrate ROI in a way that most content writers can't. \n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "As a freelance writer, this is fascinating. I like getting to see what things look like from the other side. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised there were issues on the lower paying tiers. Writing good content takes time, and I\u2019d expect problems from writers rushing to churn out tons of words at a low rate. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that the same problem occurred at the higher tier prices. I do wonder if part of the problem is that the content mills and agencies take a cut of the pay. Even if you\u2019re paying .50/word, the writer might be receiving less than that and still needing to rush through jobs. \n\nI applied for one or two content mills when I first thought about freelance writing. It was fine for dipping my toe into paid writing while I still had a day job, but there\u2019s no way I could make enough to write full-time and afford to live in my city for what they offered their writers. \n\nMost of my favorite clients that I work with are ones I work with through Upwork or that I work with directly. I don\u2019t like the fee that Upwork takes out of my price, but it\u2019s worth it for some ongoing projects. I only take one-off projects if they sound fun or if I think they\u2019ll be good for my portfolio. \n\nI do love that you included how to write a job description. If every job description were that clear, it would make it so much easier for me to give potential clients exactly what they are looking for. \n\nYou also mentioned a few sites I\u2019d never heard of that sound intriguing as a writer. So, even though I\u2019m not your intended audience, you provided a ton of useful information.",

But you're right that it was more common among at the lower tiers (of freelancers and content services/mills). \n\nFrom a writer's perspective, is there anything you wish I'd said differently about what to include in a job description, or the hiring process I recommended?",

Every once in a while I skip over ones that have a test word because I put a lot of time into my applications and feel like it should be obvious from my answers that I read the entire job description. \n\nBased on your insight, I can see why the test word is helpful though. I have noticed that I get replies back more quickly when there is a filtering test word, so that probably indicates that they work. \n\nI also think that most of the ones I\u2019ve skipped over with a test word had something else odd in the wording of the job description. I don\u2019t automatically skip them every time. \n\nAs a writer, I pay attention to the tone that I get from clients in the job description and throughout the hiring process to evaluate whether I want to work with them. I want to work with people who are pleasant to interact with. I don\u2019t know exactly how to describe the red flags without quoting specific job descriptions, but sometimes I can tell in advance that I\u2019m not going to enjoy a job even if I like the topic and the pay is great. I don\u2019t apply to those. It doesn\u2019t sound like that was an issue with your experiment, but it\u2019s something that might be helpful to other people looking to hire writers.",

            "comment": "Express Writers just hires UpWork writers. Not saying that's good or bad. But you're basically just paying them to be the middle man for their source of vetted freelance writers. At least this is how it was back when I wrote for them a few years ago. One of the managers who was really awesome left and started her own agency and things turned shitty from a freelancer perspective (docking pay for client requested edits, unreasonable timelines) so I bailed.\n\nFunny enough, after that I ended up getting hired by another agency through UpWork and realized that's all these agencies do now. So then I just started finding my own clients. It's just a side hustle for me so having 2 or 3 projects per month is all I really need. I know I'm biased but that's the way to go. Find a writer you like and work directly with them. You may even save money in the long run because you're not paying middleman agencies or freelance platform fees (or both if you're working with an agency hiring freelancers through UpWork).",

Did they want an article focused on how unexpected weight loss can be a sign of diabetes? Did they want an article discussing how losing weight can reduce the risks associated with diabetes? Their answer was vague and non-committal, but they mentioned to include CBD for weight loss. \n\nI wrote an article that included BOTH of the aforementioned angles, and sent the article back with the note that there is no evidence of CBD supporting weight loss in diabetes, and gave cited sources from reputable medical journals. Well, they refused to pay me and told me that I didn\u2019t give them what they wanted. \n\nAnother wanted an article on the difference between Asperger\u2019s and Autism. Spoiler alert: there isn\u2019t really one. So I wrote an article that explored the historical roots of Asperger\u2019s (Nazi Germany FYI) and autism, how we got to ASD from that history, the role of parents of children with ASD in the evolution of the diagnosis, where things stand today and how our understanding of both labels has been informed in medicine. \n\nI submitted the article and was met with a response that I didn\u2019t answer the question and wouldn\u2019t receive payment until it was re-written. I did answer the question, again with cited sources based in evidence, but the answer wasn\u2019t useful for their narrative.\n\nI would say 2/3 of my \u201cleads\u201d turn out like this.. most do NOT want actual evidence-based factual content, they want you to spin lies and promote some bullshit to lure people with click bait and sell them snake oil. \n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m not willing to attach my name to those things and wont compromise intellectual integrity in my writing. So that means that a significantly smaller market for me and a lot more work and energy put into leads that end up as a waste of time.\n\nIt can be extremely discouraging to find good partnerships in a market saturated with \u201clow-quality high-quantity\u201d bullshit. \n\nThanks for this perspective! I\u2019m going to give Express Writers and r/hireawriter a try now.",

No. Is it cheap? No. But will it actually produce results that matter? More likely than hiring a fiver freelancer who has 8 minutes of experience with your brand.",

IMO this is a service where you truly get what you pay for.\n\nDepending on what your budget is and the quality you are looking for, I suggest taking a look at professional/freelance journalists who have been published in \"known\" media.  They may not be as expensive as you think, especially if they are a subject matter expert and don't require a ton of research to get up to speed, but I've gone this route and the results have been great.\n\nEdit: Not to say there aren't great freelance writers that aren't journalists, I have just had a harder time finding them among everyone offering writing services.

I have worked in-house as a writer, and with marketing agencies in addition to internships and a degree in communications. \n\nBasically, what I'm saying is- you get what you pay for in most cases. Sure, you'll definitely find people charging more than the quality of their writing commands, but most good writers are worth paying more for.\n\nLuckily, I've managed to avoid job boards and have companies seeking me out for the sheer reality that a lot of people have a hard time finding good writers.\n\nMy advice:\n\nSearch for writers on social media. There, you can actually see the content they produce before you hire them. You'll see if they understand marketing and content, how they write, how they position themselves (it's a good indicator they'll know how to position you)... \n\nGranted, a lot of these writers will be more expensive, but if you want to stop burning through writers, you'll likely have to pay a little more (and you should also have the right expectations, and a good solid writing process in place within your company first).",

But I\u2019ve always picked up side gigs writing and editing, in part to earn some extra money but also to expand the types of writing and editing I do to add it to the resume. And sometimes just out of curiosity about a specific client or project.\n\nIt\u2019s all word-of-mouth referrals and generally pays $70-90/hr (I\u2019ve never worked for $/word but my hourly rate usually works out to $0.30-0.50 per word.) I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t use these content mills to find work!\n\nI thought your experiment was really eye-opening. I\u2019m surprised by the results you got for high-priced services, though as an editor who commissions freelance pieces I know quality can be a real mixed bag and hard to judge in advance, even for a writer with a great reputation.\n\nMany years ago, I picked up some work on Elance, which was the predecessor to Upwork. I had a repeat client start asking me to use an article spinner. I told him our work relationship was done. It\u2019s an insult to any writer who cares about their craft and reputation (even if it\u2019s not bylined work) to use an article spinner.\n\nAt the moment I\u2019m trying to shift my side gigs more into strategy, to tie the content directly to a specific goal or business objective and to be able to track and measure that. (A lot of my side gig work is for non-profits and institutions, so it\u2019s usually more geared toward advocacy than driving revenue.)\n\nI think unless a writer is a subject-matter expert in a really niche area, it\u2019s hard to excel in content without being able to understand how your work ties into broader business goals.",

There are people that charge thousands of dollars for one sales letters because it converts directly into thousands or millions of sales, cost per word on that is way more than $0.50.\n2. Being a native speaker to the country you are writing for can also make a huge difference by knowing the nuances of that country's language.\n3. Is the content a white paper or a fluff piece?\n\nYou have to decide who your audience is, what the purpose is and what will relate to them the most.\n\nI generally don't look at it on a per word basis.  But rather, for example, say I need a great piece of content that is around 1000 words for a blog piece.  I ask myself things like: How much is an evergreen piece of content worth and how long would a great writer need to research, write and edit it properly?  On a per hour basis, what is a reasonable amount to pay a top expert in their field?  Depends where you are, but I can tell you that a top quality piece of 1000 words should take way more than 2 hours after revisions and edits.\n\nFor comparison, I've read the average screenplay is about 20,000 words and can take 2-3 months for a first draft from a professional writer.  They aren't cranking it out in a week.  I realize content articles are very different, but again, what I said earlier in the comments, find the best, don't base it off their rates, but off their past writing that is verified and published, and pay them as much as you can to keep them writing for you.\n\nThe opportunity cost of constantly finding new people is not worth it IMO.  Plus you'll have a consistent voice in your marketing efforts.  This is based on personally having years of needing content for all sorts of projects, so real firsthand experience.",

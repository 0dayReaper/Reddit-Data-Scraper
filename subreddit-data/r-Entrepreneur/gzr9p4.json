Delivered it with the right channels and copy to the right audience.\n\n\n\n**Recreated website using UX/UI principles**:\n\nKnew website was where all my digital efforts --- pivot off of. Spent endless hours polishing and fine-tuning this step with the developers I hired. \n\nUser-friendly and aesthetically captivating. Purchases and bookings are made effortlessly --- unlike my competitors\u2019 sites that had users running around in a maze, only to give up on searching for their desired product/service/information.  \n\n**Incorporated automation**: \n\nIncorporated online point of sales, self-scheduling, self-checkout system, and unique egift-card system.\n\n**Deployed digital marketing**: \n\n- Google Ads \n- Instagram\n- Facebook \n- Waze\n\n**After 60 days**:\n\n- +110% monthly revenue\n\n- Consistently booked out 2 months out\n\n- Achieved the following metrics: \n\n1. 550% ROI\n2. 800% ROAS\n \n\n\n**Me aftermath**:\n\nDiscovered I loved doing marketing so much more than finance, so:\n\nI'm in the process of leveraging myself into a marketing managerial position with the experience I gathered and the results produced from this endeavor.\n\nWish me luck, friends!\n\n**Moral of the story**\n\nBusiness completely revived from the brink of dying; from consistently letting staff go to hiring new ones to meet the explosion of demands and traffic.\n\nUnexpectedly, I went from working an passionless job in corporate to producing monumental digital marketing results that set me up for an exciting career in marketing\n\nIt\u2019s mind-blowing how fast and sharp your fate can change, when you take a leap and dig deep when the going gets tough. \n\n**The Message**:\n\nI know times aren\u2019t looking good and most of you are discouraged to take the leap \u2014\n\nthe road ahead looks dark and you can\u2019t help but feel drained and exhausted, I know the feeling, I\u2019ve been there \u2014\n\nbut there\u2019s always a way out of the dark tunnel as long as you keep digging and strive for that one glimpse of light.\n\nGood luck friends\n\n**edits**:\n\nDisclaimer: \n\nSince some of you have been complaining about this not being specific enough \u2014 made it clear from the very beginning \u2014 \n\nthis isn\u2019t a case study and I\u2019m not trying to solicit your business \u2014\n\nThis is a \u201cpick me up\u201d of my personal story, to  \u2014 hopefully give folks some encouragements during these uncertain and ominous times by showing \u2014\n\n\u2014if I can do it, then you can do it too  \n\nDon\u2019t let a post on the internet get you worked up lol \n\n\n\n**edits**: \n\nSince this post is gaining traction: \n\nI\u2019m trying to build a stronger portfolio and apply my marketing experience and knowledge to different industries \u2014\n\nIf you have a project/business you think I can help \u2014 I\u2019m willing to work with you \u2014 free of charge",

Unfortunately, many, many businesses have still not caught up with the fact the digital marketing is one of the most important predictors of a business's success these days.\n\nQuite frankly, 99% of the time, any business that doesn't have some form of digital marketing going will be overtaken by their competitors who do, regardless of product quality, service, etc.\n\nReally interesting read, and best of luck on your new marketing endeavors!",

Before they retired they were averaging $300,000  in sales but because of the product, ecommerce was not an option for them.  \n\nFor a brick and mortar business, its more likely that you could sell your products online or in catalogs in addition to your storefront sales. Might be something to consider if you're not doing it already.",

After I graduated college I had a year off before Med school to work on business I started in college and I took the time to do exactly what you did, inject some digital/social media based marketing into their business along with some B2B contracts as lead funnels. Their business basically doubles as well. \n\nHonestly, trying to add in some B2B aspects to any business can be a huge game-changer since at the end of the day businesses have more money to spend than consumers. A few contracts with hospitals during the current COVID-19 crisis turned them from being closed and worried (and too prideful for financial help from me) to having made an extra 10% over normal monthly sales .\n\nThat initial experience I had way back during the first time I helped out ended up being part of the reason I decided to focus more on the business world instead of medicine. Luckily it's my main vocation now (not their business, but my own completely unrelated one). I will say the irony is that, despite the success, they're still a bit critical that I didn't use my engineering or medical degrees. haha",

Im from the tech end. We have scaled like crazy and are at about 200k/mo on track for 350k/mo plus  Q4. Saas company.\n\nHowever our marketing process seems broken and between covid and everything else things are hectic and even though we planned to scale smoothly that hasn't been the case.\n\nYou seem as though you really were able to dissect and plan pragmatic action. I'd love to be able to pick your brain for a few minutes. Perhaps establish a working relationship.",

I'm maintaining the points as tips &amp; somewhat general to incentivize conversation. \n\nHere are warning signs you need to be aware of:  \n\n\n1. **Strange Computer Behavior:** If your computer starts acting weird, such as exhibiting excessive network activity or becoming noticeably slower, it could be a sign of a cyber attack.\n2. **Unexpected Software Installs:** Unwanted and unexpected software installations are a significant sign of a cyber attack. Always read license agreements as these programs are often legally installed by other apps.\n3. **Autonomous Mouse Movements:** If your mouse moves and makes selections on its own during idle times, this might be a sign of a cyber intrusion, especially if these actions result in financial transactions.\n4. **Disabled Antivirus or System Tools:** If your antivirus software or tools like Task Manager/Registry Editor are suddenly disabled or won't start, it's a strong sign of a malicious compromise.\n5. **Missing Online Money:** Large sums of money missing from your online accounts could indicate a cyber attack. Always enable transaction alerts to monitor unusual activities.\n6. **Leaked Confidential Data:** If confidential data from your organization appears on the internet or the dark web, you're likely facing a serious breach. Immediate action and legal involvement are crucial.\n7. **Unusual Network Traffic:** Unexpected or strange network traffic patterns can be an early warning sign of a cyber attack. Regularly monitoring network traffic can help you detect anomalies.\n\nIf you've experienced these or are experiencing lmk! This month I'm trying to help out founders with these problems. Where do you go for help?",

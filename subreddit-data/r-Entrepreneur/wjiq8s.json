    "postText": "Two months ago I posted about [my passion project](https://puter.com/) on Reddit (here is [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/v45rb6/i_spent_a_year_building_a_desktop_environment/)).\n\nWhen I started working on this project I was pretty burned out and depressed from years of extremely hard work as a business owner (not to mention the long pandemic). I had pretty much lost all my love for the software industry and this project was literally the only thing that brought me any joy. Every day I woke up I was feeling a little better and looked forward to working a little more on my project: adding a feature here, fixing a bug there, showing it to a friend...\n\nEventually, after about a year of working on it in near isolation, I decided to post it on Reddit. The community was extremely kind towards me and the post eventually hit #1 on two major subreddits. Within the first 24 hours, it received more than 45,000 users, and I received [9 job offers](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vxd8zs/i_posted_my_project_on_reddit_and_received_9_job/). This eventually lead me to make a real company out of what was only two months ago just a small project.\n\nIt's simply amazing how the kindness of Redditors can literally change your life in such a deep and lasting way. Thank you so so so much, Reddit \u2764\ufe0f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Somebody asked what is it used for the most: aside from storing files, it would be the [notepad](https://puter.com/app/editor). Incidentally, I spent a lot of time working on the notepad which is funny even to me lol",

I've been slowly growing my Twitter account so that's been cool. I host The NoDegree Podcast so really hoping I can get a celebrity as a podcast guest soon. Podcast growth is the one thing I've been trying to crack. I passed 110 episodes recently so that's a plus!",

I love that it is so easy, even a caveman can use it. That is absolutely critical for me as many solutions out there are just to complex for me to bother.\n\nBut judging by the comments, there is likely a lot of things it can do that I don't understand. Or use cases i'm just not putting together. But are likely simple enough for me to understand and utilize. I think this is something I would use a lot, and tell a lot of people about too.\n\nIn my probably wrong opinion, the Total Addressable Market is significantly larger if you can also effectively interest non technical savvy people. Ultra short screen grab Youtube videos of multiple use cases would help that a lot. For me anyway.\n\nHonestly, i'm so excited for this, I want to see you take this as far as it will go. And I hope you have a solid plan to monetize that keeps with your eye towards simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I had a developer build me some simple project management SaaS in Mysql PHP. In part of it, people can save all types of files in different sections, but it's not very organized, just a list of the files you have saved. If instead of what I have, each project could have their own version of this open in a small window of the project screen, this would be amazing.",

My program basically uses picture values to identify stolen things being sold on Facebook marketplace, pawn shops, nextdoor etc. The idea came to me when one of my friends had his gun stolen from his car and had gokd pictures of it. Including a blemish on the butt of the handle. I used opencv in python to find a match it was listed on one of those \"gun enthusiasts\" fb pages where people really just sell weapons illegal but list it as a they are shoeing off. I'm trying to use patent this program now that I made it much more safisticated and sell it to police authorities which could save them thousands of man hours searching manually.",

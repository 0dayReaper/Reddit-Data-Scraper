    "postText": "Saw one of those \"I'm afraid to talk to investors because they might steal my ideas\" kinda posts today. Gonna get real here. I eyerolled really hard, because that kind of post shows an fundamental misunderstanding between the relationship of an investor and entrepreneur. Investor and entrepreneur relationships are not at all similar to sales work where you are trying to sell a customer on a product. And truth be told, if a customer asks \"why can't I just make X, or do X myself\", that usually means your product or processes aren't market viable enough to be bothered with.\n\nAs such, there should never really be a serious concern as to whether or not a potential investor would do well to ask \"why not just do X myself, and cut you the middleman out of the equation?\" Because if that's legit a concern, you are not adding enough value proposition to what you are offering the investor.\n\nIn that sense, when talking investors, you really need to start to think about yourself as the product, just like you would in a traditional job interview. Talk about your experience in the industry you are working in. Talk about your marketing plan, and your infrastructure. Talk about your niche. Talk about your ability to adapt to new marketplace challenges and unforeseen circumstances. And yeah, sure at some point in that discussion, you are going to talk about your actual product(s), and how that interacts with all of the above. But at no point should you be pitching a mere idea to the investor. Nobody owns an idea. You can own a patent on an invention that has specs done to a specific set of commercially viable production techniques. But you can't own the idea itself. You can own the expression of an idea, like having a cartoon mouse named Bim that loves to eat green cheese. But you can't own the concept of a cartoon animal in general.\n\nI think a lot of the reason why this misconception is so prevalent, is an artistic/development first approach to entrepreneurship, and the idea that entrepreneurship is an endeavor by and for big thinker visionaries trying to disrupt the world with their kewl new concepts. And there is some of that in the entrepreneur world, to be sure. Especially in the tech sector. The problem with that thinking is that's only a small fraction of the entrepreneur world first of all, and second, even having the bestest most cleverest idea in the world means jack shit if you don't have the infrastructure or business acumen needed to make it work.\n\nRemember, MySpace was in fact a rather clever idea for a website. It's not around anymore because FB occupied the same niche, but better. Your job when talking to investors, isn't to convince them that a big idea like FB or MySpace is a huge money making venture and the future of the internet. It's to convince said investors that you personally, are ready, willing, and equipped to fight tooth and nail to make sure that your specific interpretation of said idea is the one that is the last man standing on a pile of corpses comprised of your business competitors who just so happened to have a similar, if not identical idea to you.",

But doing that gives them equal say on the project to you, and equal shares of the profits (if any)\n\nHave fun networking. I hope you actually have something to bring to the table beyond an \"kickass idea\", like managerial skills, project manager skills, fundraising skills &amp; so on.",

            "comment": "This is a constant problem and people can pout all they want. They are shutting down because they can't come up with another solution to the Revenue problem Reddit has. And I think this valuation rather than profitability discussion is long overdue.\n\nWe won't be having that discussion going dark. But not having tough discussions and not coming up with genuine solutions is what entrepreneurship is about these days.\n\nThe thing where you hate business and really hate other people making money yet want it for yourselves will end. But not today.\n\nWhat I hate about the other side of this is Reddit has continued to state profitability was never the point and then pulls these monetization schemes. Just like any wantrepreneur claiming they never wanted a hundred million dollars, just grow this craptastic business model so they can move out of their parent's basement.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. You swing for the fences every single time, then settle for a base hit. Sorry.\n\nNo \"lessons learned.\" [Why You Shouldn\u2019t Build A Business On An API Call](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/why-you-shouldnt-build-a-business-on-an-api-call/)",

If (if) they went into this, it should have been knowing full well you make as much as you can, while you can.\n\nThe people who staked their subsistence livelihoods and future on the one company in town are looking really smart. The impotent bitching isn't any different though.",

    "postText": "How does an unknown startup with a new product gain early traction and nail its launch?   \nSebastian, the 25-year-old founder of ChatIQ, may have the answer. In under 3 weeks, ChatIQ has organically acquired over 3,500 customers for their AI chatbot software, all through organic video marketing.   \n**How did you come up with the idea for ChatIQ?**  \nI was planning out different business ideas/software I could create in a short period of time, (that'd have the skills to build myself) and I was also super interested in OpenAI. I knew it was a huge emerging market but didn't quite know how I could use it (at the time I had no idea id even be able to build an app that uses it).  \nI knew businesses spent huge amounts of time and money working on converting cold traffic into customers, using chatbots, email marketing and all sorts. This is time-consuming and expensive. So wanted to build a solution that would;   \nA) use AI as it was hugely trending and also insanely powerful   \nB) was easy to use and affordable/customisable for businesses.  \nThe initial idea was a chatbot for agency businesses (as I\u2019d worked in and on them for a few years and understood the market) but eventually as I developed the chatbot I wanted it to become something everyone and anyone could use and let them decide on the use case. I build the tools to make it easy for users, and they have control. (I\u2019ve spoken to so many people with creative ideas for chatbots because of this move).  \n**How did you acquire 3500 users in 3 weeks?**  \nBecause when I stopped all work back in November 2022 to focus on launching a saas business, I had spent some time building up a youtube channel, I uploaded over 100 videos in just 2 months and got it to 1000 subscribers around January 2023, I had a platform to launch on and get some initial users. However, the youtube channel wasn't really in the correct niche (I probably could have planned that better)  \nSo, knowing there was huge explosive potential in short-form content I sat down one night, edited 6 short videos until about 4 am, and then over the next 24 hours posted them. The first 5 were getting a few hundred, maybe 1000 views. I was documenting the process as I was gradually getting a new user, I think I was averaging around 5-10 a day for a couple of days. Then suddenly the 6th TikTok I posted got over 130k views. In a couple of days, I\u2019d gone from 15 users to over 800.  \nThe marketing strategy was always to start with organic video content, something id got working before with my photography business years ago, I knew I'd done it once before so could do it again. Then just doubled down on that.   \nAlthough the numbers are exciting for growth and obviously needed, the focus in my eyes is 100% user satisfaction. It was always a dream to build a successful saas product, it happened faster than I expected but as long as my users are happy with ChatIQ and it can provide them with everything they need from it I'm happy.   \nYou can read the [rest of the interview here](https://www.jobdai.com/post/from-0-to-3k-users-in-3-weeks-an-ai-entrepreneur) with the details of the product building and user acquisition stages.",

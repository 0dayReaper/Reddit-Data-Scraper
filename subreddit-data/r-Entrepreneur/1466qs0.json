I used a course from the Internet Business school (Google Ads Masterclass) and put down $10 per day to find out what keywords work. Once I knew what keywords work, I slowly amped it up to $30 a day and I'm making about 2x on my marketing investment now",

Also if you're in the US take a look at care credit. They create instant credit cards with after just a quick credit check. This lets your clients split up a bigger ticket into managable payments but you still get your money up front.\n\nWe also checked out an app at one point (can't remember the name) that allowed you to send a quick personalized video message to your clients. It's supposed to maximize the quota of people who actually show up to the call (the rate is usually abysmal).\n\nAnd lastly, I'd suggest finding a way to keep in touch with your clients once they're done. Make a reason to call them some time later and communicate this reason with them. When you do call them, ask who they know that's a smoker who wants to quit. Or, if you're really cheeky, ask them to put you in touch with their GP (doctors are a massive win if you can get them, they never run out of smokers to send you)",

    "postText": "No real world experience, nobody to help, no ideas, but want to start a business.\n\nHi everybody,\n\nI (27M) want to start a business but do not know where to start at all. I dropped out of college at 20, where I was studying Hotel and Restaurant management. Reason for dropping out was to help my older brother run his nail salon. He recently sold the shop and abandoned me. Doing nails since I was 17, has burned me out and I want to jump into something else. Problem is I have no skills outside of nails, and no other interests with no one to help. I have been on buy BizBuySell to get an idea of the many businesses out there, but they all seem intimidating.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Once it gets bigger, you may have your own team and start your own agency. If you're not sure, I suggest attending some of their recruitment to have a feel of it. Just be aware, both are very very complicated product that requires patience to explain. However, as you come from hospitality background, i think you may be able to pull it.",

Would you? What if you could do a 30-minute routine accompanied by an on-the-run shake?  \nWould this be something you would be interested in?  \nI am super interested in this venture, and I want to validate if travellers would actually use such a facility...  \nWhat do you think???",

Some might but not the majority . Which then makes me think if you do decide to open cold like that, probably will be losing business for a while hoping that it catches on. And it might not, but early on 100% will not be profitable. Since that\u2019s mostly what you\u2019re going to get, foot traffic. People get re routed etc all the time through different airports etc, you\u2019d ideally want to get into the busiest one , which again probably wont be cheap since everyone wants to be in the busiest ones with the most foot traffic. Also as far as meditation rooms, sounds too similar to what\u2019s already offered where you can rent out your own pods / personal spaces to work/ relax / nap / meditate even etc\u2026. Not trying to shoot your idea down just giving you a few of my initial thoughts that popped in my head",

            "comment": "I was on 13 flights in the month of May and according to Google Maps insights I spent over 24 hours in airports (not including the 14 hours of flying). I am also an extremely active person who exercises regularly. So I feel very qualified to answer this question.\n\nI don't think I would ever go to a gym within the airport. Here's why:\n\n1. Time - Exercise takes time to change clothes, get a good workout in, cleanup, change clothes again, etc... I rarely have enough time for all of that before getting on a flight or between connecting flights. The only exception would be if there are flight delays, but even long delays are usually announced incrementally.\n\n2. Clothes and Hygiene Supplies - I don't want to carry extra clothes and equipment through the airport. Even if I have the appropriate gear with me, it's typically not easy to navigate through a suitcase to find specific clothes and other hygiene supplies.\n\n3. Luggage - I would either need to drag my luggage around the gym with me. Or if there was some kind of secure locker/storage system, I would need to hope that all of my luggage fits in this locker.\n\nAs a traveler, I don't think I would ever use the gym, not even once. Now, what another commenter suggested about airline employees... that may be a totally different story that may be worth exploring.",

Like schedule a slot ahead of time. This way you\u2019ll likely negate unnecessary time loss. \n\n2. This is something that a lot of people are mentioning and for good reason. I can think of two things off the cuff. Supply clothing (generic) or tone down the activity to avoid excess sweating. Yoga or stretch/posture routines. I\u2019m aware you\u2019ll likely sweat regardless but at least nothing leaving puddles around you. \n\n3. As mentioned above, the facility would have to provide clothing or accessories to avoid that. Although that\u2019s a hurdle in itself. Sizing of clothing etc. \n\nThis is just me brainstorming how to deal with these scenarios. They may not work at all but nonetheless thanks for the comment.",

Majority of the customers were airline employees but we also did have passengers. Our gym had showers and rented out towels so that solves the problem of getting sweaty then going on an airplane. Overall I think it would be a great idea that needs to be geared more towards airport and airline employees.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. My name is Marat, I'm a Software Engineer living in Serbia. 10 days ago, on June, 1 I started my journey to $100K and I want to do that in 100 days. I won't count my salary as an engineer, only other sources of income.\n\nI've started posting short videos of my progress on TikTok, now I want to also post here, for some additional motivation and discipline.\n\nI don't consider any investments at the moment, because I've started from zero. What I've done already? \n\nMy main expertise is Java and Backend development so I've started offering mentoring services for those who want to learn Java. Also I'm working on a mobile app which will help developers to prepare for technical interviews. I've chosen TypeScript and React Native to create the app. I didn't have any experience with them before but I'm learning and hopefully I'll be able to create an MVP in a couple of weeks.\n\nI've also started networking on LinkedIn, just sending cold messages with invitations to connect. I've already had a few very nice communications with people from different countries. I was very anxious about writing to people, and now I realize that my anxiety is slowly disappearing. This post is also aims to reduce my anxiety and fear of negative evaluation. \n\nI'd be happy to hear some advices/recommendations as long as any successful stories. Thanks :)",

One tip here is to avoid the LION (LinkedIn Open Networking) groups - it is just an exercise in building connections with zero relevance to your business.\n\nI would suggest a change in approach. If you are already making TikToks about this journey, why not post daily videos on LinkedIn as well? It would interest a lot of people and possibly get passed around a fair bit. The connections you get will be far more organic than forced networking.",

And the true purpose of the post is fighting with the fear I guess.\n\nI respect your opinion and stay with mine. There are different situations. For example, one guy wrote he just wants to create a couple of apps for himself. He doesn't want to make it a career. \n\nI didn't get what you said about the app that I'm making. The purpose of the app is to help to prepare, basically the app will contain questions and answers in some form. So there is no hack to the interview.",

Putting yourself out there is always a big difficult!\n\n&gt; I respect your opinion and stay with mine.\n\nLikewise :D\n\n&gt; For example, one guy wrote he just wants to create a couple of apps for himself. He doesn't want to make it a career.\n\nFair point. My question is: what can you provide that isn\u2019t already widely available? I suck at making apps, never learned how to properly (aging my college education a bit maybe). During the pandemic, I felt like trying it and found tons of tutorials on YouTube, Medium, etc. I found GitHub repos I could directly look at code in to see what was going on. Every question I had was already answered. What value can you add to this realm?\n\n&gt; I didn't get what you said about the app that I'm making. The purpose of the app is to help to prepare, basically the app will contain questions and answers in some form.\n\nIs this different from the preexisting dozens of sources for this? LeetCode is pretty well known and already has a bunch of clones.\n\nWhat I meant with hacky was that in providing a question bank, you\u2019ve (potentially - idk your plan just know other people in the space) encouraged memorization over actual understanding. It\u2019s like the whole DuoLingo thing. You can regurgitate sentences but don\u2019t understand the grammar to then compose your own sentences.",

Include links to resources you used, but be sure to check if they are still online when you publish it. Use Amazon Kindle, it's the most widely used ebook publisher.\n\n3) Be sure to get lots of testimonials from your clients. Use those to generate interest, and establish trust.\n\n4) Craft a decent ecommerce site to handle your social media presence.\n\n5) Network with like-minded creatives.\n\nThis is a years long effort, so be patient and don't become discouraged.\n\nBest of luck!",

It's great to set high targets, but don't forget to be mindful of the challenges and limitations that may come your way.\r  \n\roffering mentoring services and working on a mobile app are proactive steps to generate income outside your regular salary. Just keep in mind the demand for these services and the competition out there. Doing thorough market research and understanding your target audience's needs will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of what you're offering.\r  \n\rlearning new technologies like TypeScript and React Native is commendable. However, creating an MVP in a couple of weeks might be overly optimistic. developing a quality app takes time and expertise. It's better to focus on delivering a robust and user-friendly product rather than rushing through the process.\r  \n\rnetworking on linkedin is a valuable strategy, but cold messaging doesn't always yield fruitful results. It's important to establish genuine connections by personalizing your outreach and providing value to the people you connect with. but mostly building meaningful relationships requires alot of patience and effort.\r  \n\rreducing your anxiety and fear of negative evaluation is also important, but remember that setbacks and criticism are inevitable, try to embrace them as opportunities for growth and improvement. Seeking advice and learning from successful stories can be beneficial, but be cautious about comparing yourself too closely to others. remember that everyone's journey is unique.\r  \n\roverall, it's crucial to have a realistic perspective on your goals and timeline. Continuously evaluate your strategies, adapt when necessary, and be prepared to overcome challenges along the way. with a balanced approach, perseverance, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures, you can work towards achieving your financial objectives. good luck Marat and remember validate your market demand and take sufficient time for App development, if you want you can talk to me about anything in mind! \n\n\r  \nthank you for your time! and Keep Pushing!",

As others have mentioned, make your value apparent to all who read your content/ posts/ emails by literally sharing some of your knowledge and or experiences, which will draw people towards you. I personally know a couple in North Carolina who broke records in the company they joined two months ago and earned $400,000 this past month. You will succeed!",

Not only are you learning but you\u2019re also building a network of people who see you as something other than an employee.\n\nAs engineers, we take pride in our work and value results over relationships sometimes, but just keep in mind that these connections you make today might make or break your destiny as an entrepreneur on day 100, or day 1000. \n\nI once tried to start a medical device company with 4 friends. We were very good. We created a product at 5% the cost a large company could have. But we lacked the connections necessary to get past regulatory hurdles. I now work at a different company. One of our executives\u2019 parents just happens to own a hospital. That\u2019s right, they own a damn hospital and can get clinical trials done with a phone call. Would\u2019ve come in real handy at our last venture.\n\nWhat I take from that is connections are everything. Make the key relationships now because once you need them, it will be too late to start. Everything else can be rushed. Relationships are not one of them.",

You should be connecting with anyone you actually interact with.   Coworkers, customers, clients, mentors, neighbors, etc.  As soon as you interact with someone new, send them a connection.  Personalize the note.  Spam marketing messages are a complete waste of time.  No one of importance reads them.  Good luck!",

    "postText": "I've been in the trenches of influencer marketing for quite some time now. And truth be told, I was pretty terrible at it when I first started out.\n\nThe campaigns I ran for brands just weren't generating the sales I had hoped for.\n\nBut after a lot of trial and error, I realized there were four common reasons why these campaigns were falling flat. Here's the lowdown:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Choosing the wrong influencers: I was dazzled by influencers with large followings and sleek feeds, only to realize these weren't the key to success. Now, the approach is more refined:\n\n* Checking follower counts and engagement rates.\n* Browsing through the comments to check the kind of engagement\n* Checking alignment with brand values.\n* Ensuring the influencer's content is engaging and persuasive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Sloppy onboarding: I was basically just sending products to influencers and hoping for the best. Not a good move. Now, I've developed a solid onboarding document with all the details like:\n\n* Info about the brand (logo, product shots, etc.)\n* Clearly outlined expectations and perks\n* Where to contact in case of questions\n* Any processes I use (approval, payouts, etc.)\n\nYou can check the exact template we use [here](https://www.getsaral.com/academy/sales-from-influencer-posts).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Infrequent posts: There were times when influencers just weren't posting enough. The solution? An 'activation drip'\u2014 a set of pre-scheduled, automated emails sent over time. These reminders:\n\n* Share success stories from other influencers.\n* Provide examples of effective content.\n* Keep them in the loop about the benefits of working with my brand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Product-market fit if off: And then, there were those times when I hit a wall and realized there was nothing more I could do. The product just didn't fit the market. If this happens:\n\n* Consider whether other channels are successful. If not, influencer marketing might not be right for you.\n* If you're not making headway anywhere, it's time to focus on finding your product-market fit.  \n\n\nLet me know if you want more details about each problem and solution. I will share those.  \nWhat about you? Any facepalm or eureka moments you've experienced in influencer marketing?",

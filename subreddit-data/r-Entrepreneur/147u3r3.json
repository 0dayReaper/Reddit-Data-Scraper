Woo commerce is very popular, and stripe is a good reccomendation in my opinion. I don't think there is any dodging fees entirely, and there's no truly dodging competition either, just having a site all to yourself instead of sharing it.",

But the last three are going to require a lawyer at best, and high quality paid template at least, unless you want to risk your pocketbook and chances of being sued with free ones.\n\nADA I'm actively trying to figure out XD it's a lot of research, work, and testing.

    "postText": "Hey guys, my company is in the process of doing big research on outsourcing software development now. So I decided why not ask these questions here. I really try to understand how entrepreneurs choose a development partner, there are so many of them. So I'd really appreciate if you could share your experience with me.\n\n\\- Did you have such an experience? Was it bad or good?\n\n\\- By what criteria did you choose a company?\n\nThanks",

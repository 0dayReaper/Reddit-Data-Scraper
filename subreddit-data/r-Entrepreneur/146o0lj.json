    "postText": "Here's your chance to rant about how much this subreddit sux. Lets try to contain it to a single weekly thread - here. \n\nWe're going to start removing any individual posts - because they're becoming quite meta, but it's only fair to have a regular place for constructive criticism. To be clear, no personal attacks will be tolerated here either - but feel free to use this post as a subreddit punching bag/soap box, and tell the mods what a terrible job we're doing. \n\nAlso if you want to be a moderator/future punching bag, self-nominate with a post here. You must have contributed to this sub for at least 4 years (show us a 4 year old post, comments, etc). You must also be active on the sub in the last 3 months (comments or new submissions.).",

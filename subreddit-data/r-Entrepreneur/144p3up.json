    "postText": "Air 2023 Directed by Ben Affleck on Prime\n\nThis week I had nothing to do at work, so while scrolling through Prime, I thought let me watch 10 mins of Air (movie based on how Air Jordan\u2019s were made), turns out I watched 2 hrs 15 mins, not once I checked my phone, I didn\u2019t even realise when I closed the door or brought food, that\u2019s how glued I was. However, it\u2019s not it\u2019s true story of Sonny Vaccaro, a Nike shoe salesman who helped to sign Michael Jordan to a contract with the company in 1984 that got me appealed, it was the emotional touch. Sonny Vaccaro's belief in Michael Jordan. Nike's willingness to take risks. Nike's focus on innovation. Nike's marketing campaigns. Nike's commitment to quality, were some of the highlights of the film being praiseworthy.\n\nDo watch and comment what you think, if you have, drop a comment of what you think of Nikes Marketing campaign of getting Micheal Jordan.",

    "postText": "Hi all, hope all is well!\n\nI couple of months ago I closed my first clients, which are also old schoolmates of mine, for this pretty big software development project. \n\nThey told me that they went to established software development agencies and they would charge well over \u20ac10.000,-\n\nI told them I would normally do it for \u20ac7.250,- , but for them I would do it for \u20ac6.500,-. We eventually settled on \u20ac6.250,-. (They will be paying monthly maintenance after launch)\n\nThis project is basically airbnb but instead of houses and apartments, hosts rent out boats.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a delay and seems like we can launch end of next week but they now want to get a delay fee. I told them in the beginning that it can take linger than expected because of unforeseen circumstances. \n\nMy question is, should I have charged them way more or was this okay for a first client and should i give them the delay fee?",

Remind them how much you've saved them and explain that with anyone else the chances are they'd have found some extra reason to add even more on top of the $10k. It'll be fine I'm sure.",

It's normal to be cheap when you're looking for your first clients. I charge hobo money pretty much for my services, except for web development. For that I charge reasonable prices for the amount of expertise I have (not much I think). Most importantly, you have to consider for yourself whehter you do this as a side hustle or as a main source of income. If you do this as a side hustle, then you're doing well with that income. If it's ur main income, then consider for urself how much you want to earn if it were a job. You make that or more per month, then you're good. \n\nGood luck man!",

Honestly, the skill has served me in mass marketing, but even more so in workplace and client relationships. \n\nYou know them best, so follow your gut here, but in all client relationships, be sure to navigate their emotions strategically, because clients can do harm. And ultimately they\u2019re people, with their livelihoods and reputations on the line, they\u2019re not machines. \n\nMake them feeeeeel good. This is what people/clients/customers remember - how you made them feel. And make them feel like their success story is your success story; they\u2019ll appreciate feeling like you have skin in the game. \n\nMaybe instead of a fee, if you\u2019re doing any marketing, you could use a testimonial from them, and you would both get eyeballs on your businesses.

Ridiculous concept and I would not let that idea take root with a client I was keeping. At this point I would start trying to figure out how to keep the friendships of your old mates and get out of the project. Maybe find a few names of other contractors and give them those to pursue.\n\nMost tech companies have at least 2 deep in a tech department and those salaries start in the low 6 figures. Building and running a tech platform via a contractor is just proof of concept stuff and should not be a long term solution. If you are continuing then I would come up with an hourly contract rate and give that to them for any ongoing work. Does not matter if its fixing anything or adding to the existing code or making a sandwich- its all the same, u get an hourly rate and I always had a minimum number of hours. \n\nI would never bid any app work by the job anymore.

Serious clients get contract work and I wouldn't work for people that don't. Some projects do start with contract for proof of concept but they have to be transitioned at some point. A tech company has to eventually be able to handle its technology platform.\n\nLots and lots of people sit and spit ball ideas and then try and find someone to make it all happen for 10-20k and that is just not realistic beyond just proof of concept. What you are doing will buy you a world of headache. You could end up working for a few dollars an hour and still end up with clients that are pissed off and unhappy. They want what they call a  'delay fee' now which is not just ballsey but shows they don't get it and they probably never will at this point. Mark my words they will give you a bug list along with some things that they claim should have just been included in what you already did and they will expect you to do it all for free because in their minds its all part of this upfront money. What you charged them is the same as a company would pay a team to just organize and barely started on a project. Custom Web apps eat up a staff to build, maintain and extend. For what they paid it should be a code generated proof of concept but they want to now build an entire company around it and you are going to be the one that gets leaned on. I would hold up and rethink this. You are going to start bleeding hours if you continue without getting a clear understanding worked out with these guys.\n\nI'm sure the big outfits they went to explained all of this and that's why you ended up with the project.",

I don't mean to be abrasive. I am sure you will figure it all out.",

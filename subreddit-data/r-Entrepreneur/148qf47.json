    "postText": "We have a 3PL software that we\u2019ve run for about 9 years. We aren\u2019t we\u2019ll sound in terms of sales and stuff but we are well versed in tech(obviously). \n\nSo we\u2019ve been trying to sell our software(source code), so complete ownership, but we aren\u2019t sure how to price it, because we\u2019ve seen other similar apps sold(without source code) for about 250K. So we\u2019ve decided to settle at a price of 150K so that we can try to find a buyer quickly and move onto our new project sooner, but we aren\u2019t completely sure if we are low balling it. Hence the question of around what price ShipBob software would have sold for?\n\nAnd 1 more question:\nWe don\u2019t want to disclose our financial information, as we believe it is unnecessary since the profit of the next company would solely depend on the marketing, sales etc. We are offering a free complete demo of our software letting the prospect know that what the see is what they will get, so if they believe they can turn it into a full fledge business maybe something like ShipBob that\u2019s on them. Is this unethical/wrong?\n\nAdditional Info: We are looking to either sell it to a Tech Company so they could Relabel and provide it as a service to other smaller fulfillment services in a region. Or to a Fulfillment service that could possibly become the next ShipBoB in a different Region.\n\nTLDR: Any advice on how to go about the pricing of a software that is probably similar to what ShipBob and such fulfillment services use, is it possible to sell it without the disclosure of financial information and advice on specific targeting/finding buyers, would be really appreciated.",

            "comment": "Ah, the mysterious world of software pricing! It can be as puzzling as trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the instruction manual. But fear not, my tech-savvy friend! Let's unravel this pricing puzzle and sprinkle it with a dash of humor along the way.  \nSo, you've got a 3PL software, and you're ready to sell it. But setting the right price can be as tricky as finding Waldo in a crowd of emojis. You've seen similar apps going for around 250K, but you're thinking of settling at 150K to speed up the selling process. Smart move! However, you're curious about the approximate price of ShipBob's software. Ah, the million-dollar question!  \nNow, my crystal ball isn't fine-tuned to predict the exact price of ShipBob's software, but let's just say it could be higher than a stack of pancakes at a fancy brunch. Pricing can vary based on a multitude of factors, like features, market demand, and the occasional unicorn sighting. So, while 150K might be your sweet spot, remember that each software's value is as unique as a fingerprint. You're on the right track, my friend!  \nNow, onto your second question. You're offering a complete demo of your software without disclosing financial information. Is that unethical or wrong? Well, imagine going on a blind date and being asked to share your bank statements. Awkward, right? So, fret not! It's not unethical to keep your financial cards close to your chest. Your prospective buyers can evaluate the potential based on the demo and determine if they have the magic touch to turn it into the next ShipBob. It's all about the trust and pizzazz you bring to the table.  \nWhen it comes to targeting buyers, it's like searching for the perfect slice of pizza in a crowded city. You want to find a tech company looking to expand or a fulfillment service hungry for success. Reach out to industry events, network like a champ, and spread the word. Think of yourself as a software cupid, matching your creation with the perfect suitor. Love is in the code, my friend!  \nSo, my techpreneur, take a deep breath, sprinkle some confidence, and set that price with a touch of finesse. Good luck on your software selling adventure, and may your profits soar higher than a well-thrown frisbee on a sunny day! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udcb0",

            "comment": "I sold my B2B software to another company in a completely different niche, but my experience might apply. I think both me and the buyer compared it to the buyer's alternative of developing the same product themselves, in terms of equivalent full-time hours of development it would take, plus debugging and documentation and whatever else your product includes. Then multiply that direct labor cost by 2.5 or so which is a standard overhead multiple. That should be what it would cost the buyer to write their own version, compared to purchasing yours.\n\nThen they'll look at the opportunity cost for needing a year to bring their own version to market (or whatever), the goodwill of you already having a successful and happy user base and known brand in your niche compared to starting with a new product, you having a customer support script already in place for handling tech support calls, whether or not your technology is current, whether or not your code is clean and well engineered or a bunch of kludges, and adjust their price accordingly.\n\nThey may also want your lead engineer to train their own team for maybe a month or more on the codebase, depending on how complicated and technically documented it is. \n\nAs to finding a buyer, look into parallel industries for companies that might want to expand into your niche. Maybe a general warehousing rental company that wants to expand into product fulfillment instead of just renting warehouse space? Google on a bunch and reach out to their \"new business development\" department if they have one, or VP of sales if they're small. You might also find companies at industry conventions, which is where I found my buyer.  \n\nJust some ideas.",

    "postText": "I've had this in my draft post for weeks and idk if it's of any value to anyone at this point but here goes:\n\nGot the final numbers this week and to my disbelief, I 8x\u2019d my income between 2021 ($25k) and 2022, while still in college.\n\nRealizing I made this money last year hasn't made me any happier than when I worked at a restaurant for $2k/mo, but I did learn more last year than any other year, about business and life. Hopefully there's something in here that helps someone out there.\n\nMy business is an ecommerce business, I buy containers of product that I've white-labelled from a manufacturer in China and sell it online. I don't work from a beach in Bali or drive a nice car, most of my year was sitting behind a computer at my desk, answering calls, visiting the warehouse, etc. My day-to-day resembles most 9-5 jobs. But, I'm making enough money to support myself and building equity, and that's been the #1 goal since I got started.\n\nSome background, my first experience in business was a drop shipping business that I started in 2020. It had all kinds of issues and stressed me the fuck out, but I managed to sell it in the summer of 2021 for $15k. People always say \"don't sell unless it's a life changing amount of money\" and as dumb as it sounds, $15k at the time WAS a life changing amount of money. I'd never seen that much money at once, and that check proved to me that I was at least capable of creating something valuable. Smiling ear-to-ear, I took my $15k to the bank and enjoyed the rest of the summer without a care in the world.\n\nFor two months, I applied to jobs, internships, and got ready for school to start up again in the fall. After a single week of classes, I realized there was no way I'd be able to sit still for another 2 years of school: I had to start something new. I started looking for product ideas.\n\nMy criteria was this:\n\n\\\\- high AOV ($500+)\n\n\\\\- no local competition\n\n\\\\- somehow related to my existing product/industry knowledge\n\nWithin a few weeks, I stumbled on what I thought was an amazing product that fit my criteria, and decided that instead of leaving my hard-earned $15k in the S&amp;P, I was going to go all-in on starting my own direct-to-consumer business. I blamed most of the issues of the drop shipping business on how dependent I was on the supplier, and thought by taking on more risk and servicing a larger portion of the value chain, I could create something more sustainable (and more profitable). I would buy inventory from a factory overseas, wait several months for it to arrive, brand it, and sell it online.\n\nI started with one order (one pallet) of the product from China in November 2021. This was when shipping rates were still insane so the cost of the product was about $5k and the shipping was $7k via ocean, so after some other costs, ads, Shopify etc I'd pretty much put all the money I had into this new idea. The first pallet took about 4 months to arrive, but in that time I was running ads, sending out samples to customers, and improving the website. I managed to sell the entire first batch of inventory before it arrived, and used that revenue to order another pallet from the factory in January 2022.\n\nBy March 2022, the second pallet was sold out and I ordered my first 20' container. This was a huge jump in order size, and suddenly my entire net worth was in that container, plus I had $10k in credit card debt. Everything was riding on that container, if something went wrong I'd pretty much be SOL.\n\nOf course, the manufacturer fucked it up and sent about 35% of the inventory in the wrong colour, with this terrible finishing material that looked really cheap and fake. The product I'm selling is very aesthetic-based and I've priced/marketed it on the higher end, so this was devastating to me. I had a meltdown in my bedroom, yelled a bunch, took some deep breaths, and prayed that this wouldn't sink me. For weeks, I had nightmares of all the 1-star reviews, returns, complaints, lawsuits, etc., but there was nothing I could do. I took photos of the product as it was, put it on the website and hoped for the best.\n\nA small number of people complained, but most people didn't seem to mind the difference (or know the difference, since there were virtually no competitors in this niche), and the \"terrible\" inventory was sold out within a matter of weeks. We even got a few positive reviews during that time which really got the ball rolling.\n\nAs usual, when it feels like the sky is falling...it usually isn't.\n\nAs the months went by, I kept repeating this process: Ordering product, selling it, calling customers for feedback, having the factory make changes to the product, selling more, repeat.\n\nI sold $80k/month from June-September, $100k in October, $200k in November and $120k last month.\n\nI closed out 2022 with 800k in revenue, I netted about 25%. No employees, some contractors for odd jobs, and a 3PL. From Jan-May I was in school (taking 5 classes) while working a part-time internship in fintech. In May, I went full time into the business, but was back to school in the fall with three classes. My grades have taken a hit as the business has grown but I'm still on track to graduate in April.\n\nI've finally hired a full time employee to handle customer service and am now working on adding new products and pursuing new markets.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I made $25k in 2021. In 2020 I depended solely on COVID checks, and before that I waited tables while pursuing a career in music.\n\nHere's a few of the things that have helped me the most over the past 2 years.\n\n**Be honest about your reasons for doing things**\n\nAsk yourself this - if you could never tell a single soul about what you're doing, would you still do it?\n\nIf you could never brag at dinner parties about owning your own business, would you still want to own one? If you couldn't put \"entrepreneur\" in your bio would you still want to be one? If you can't answer these questions honestly, reflect on your reasons for doing what you do. In my experience, it's incredibly hard to succeed at something if your primary motivator is vanity/ego.\n\nThe life of a business owner is too ugly and painful to be worth it if you're just doing it is to flex on imaginary haters. I made the biggest strides in life and business after I deleted my instagram account and haven't looked back.\n\n**The silver bullet you're looking for is sacrificing the thing you love the most**\n\nI'm not there yet, but the one thing that's helped me progress more in life and business more than anything else has been giving up one of the things I love the most: alcohol.\n\nI absolutely love the feeling of being drunk, but from March-October last year I didn't have a drop of alcohol and the business objectively wouldn't have done as well as it did if I didn't make that choice. I also felt, like, incredibly happy considering how much bullshit I was dealing with as a never-ending stream of problems and tasked continue to pile on.\n\nThe subconscious reward structures I'd built for myself (alcohol to celebrate, to relax, to end the week, etc) weren't really apparent until I stopped drinking. Same went for the escapist tendencies (alcohol to forget problems, mitigate anxiety), I didn't realize how much of a crutch alcohol was until I cut it out for an extended period of time.\n\nSome people don't have crutches at all, some people have different ones like weed, porn, video games, etc. If you have something that you go to when things get really hard, try cutting it out for a few weeks. You'll be surprised at how much more you can handle than you thought, even without your crutch.\n\nHeineken 0% feels 90% as good and has none of the downsides, highly recommend.\n\n**Run towards whatever scares you the most**\n\nAlmost every single \"win\" from last year stemmed from doing something that scared the shit out of me. Over-communicating with customers when their orders were delayed by MONTHS. Calling customers personally when they were pissed off and letting them yell at me. Reaching out to people who I deemed to be out of my weight class (celebrities, big retailers, etc) and pitching our product. Putting out content that I'd made myself (that I was starring in) on the company socials. This stuff all scared the shit out of me and I wanted nothing more than to NOT do any of it - \"just bury yourself in the Shopify dashboard, you don't need to do any of that\" is what I told myself.\n\nEvery single time that I put my head down and ran towards the thing that scared me the most, I was paid back 10 times over. Customers went from angry to understanding. Big collaborators featured us at no-cost and skyrocketed our growth. Videos went viral, etc. Good things happened that I never would've imagined.\n\nIf it scares the shit out of you, run towards it.\n\nThat's it - I have no idea what the future will bring, but these are the learnings that have stood out to me the most thus far. Wishing everyone a prosperous 2023",

I know I won't meet the same success as fast or maybe even as well as you but getting started has been the biggest part of why I feel like such a failure I have not started anything and I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life but I'm going to do as you have said here and quit gaming for a few weeks completely cold turkey and see how I feel. Gaming has been the one thing that has been my fallback after I start a small something but then quit after trying I always go back to it and waste 8 plus hours if I can. Thank you OP",

Firstbase, Capbase, they make it easy. Don\u2019t overthink it.

And all the \"gurus\" shilling their dropshipping and Amazon FBA courses have definitely given Chinese goods a bad name.\n\nBut I think you're missing one important point: over the years, Chinese businesses have also evolved. They understand that there is demand for high quality stuff, too, and I bet that's the kind of stuff OP is buying and reselling, not the cheap crap. \n\nWhen I was growing up, for example, it was \"cheap crap from Japan\" that everyone laughed at. But 20 years later, Japan was beginning to be seen as THE place to buy high end goods, and it still has much of that same reputation for high quality, high priced, high end goods. That's the same path China is on, although it hasn't quite got to Japan's status yet.\n\nIf someone's paying $500 and up per unit, that's unlikely to be a low end cheapo product. And for that price, quality is a prerequisite, otherwise the manufacturer would go out of business handling the return volume and the complaints and negative reviews. There's still definitely the arbitrage factor: buy cheap and sell high, but honestly, that's true even in an entirely-created-in-a-Western-country business. The price you pay at the store is ALWAYS much, much higher than the cost of manufacturing, unless you're buying from a hand-crafted-by-the-owner shop.\n\nThat's just how business works.",

By my 26th birthday I had dropped out from Uni(unofficially) to start a company, then started another one during the pandemic and had tremendous success but for a very short period of time. Things went sideways very quickly and swiftly. Due to inexperience in management and leadership I went almost bankrupt. It was the worst year in my life, I had no joy left, no energy, no motivation. But, an opportunity existed to provide Customer Services for United States so I sold my last business for 5k, cooled down in the beach for a couple of weeks and went to United States to get clients. Got a couple of small project to support insurance companies in multiple Processes like customer support, live chat support and insurance claims auditing. Now running on a team of 10 and wanting to grow. \n\nThanks for sharing you story, wish you the best!",

Becoming an entrepreneur because you can brag is not really advise\n\nIf you\u2019re not in it for the craft, most won\u2019t last until the money starts hitting your bank\n\n2. Giving up alcohol is hardly advice either but just common sense\n\nOn top of that quitting alcohol does not \u201cbenefit\u201d your business in any way. If you\u2019re drinking during working hours you have a bigger problem\n\n3. Run towards what scares you the most\n\nWhile partially true, acquiring a huge amount of debt should scare you if you don\u2019t have a plan for when you\u2019re falling at the bad side of this entire story and things don\u2019t plan out.\n\nMy point is that the advise people are looking for on this sub is how did you do it? Not some guru telling us to quit alcohol.\n\nGive us a breakdown on how you did things so we can learn from you as a veteran entrepreneur.\n\nThis post is full of I did X revenue that month and Y revenue that month but nothing really tangible to work on.\n\nSo yes I am skeptical of OP and I\u2019m not asking him for his payout slips, but you don\u2019t setup shop and sell 200K of goods without a decent plan logistically and marketing wise.\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to learn from guys like this and unless I see something that gives me proof that OP actually did what he did, this post has the same amount of value as wallstreetbet posts.\n\n#cryptobro #tothemoon",

I have spent 10+years as salesman in pharmaceutical companies and at the end I was completely exhausted and stressed out, and the reason was zero money \ud83d\udcb0 in my account and when I got the termination letter from my manager right after 2 or 3 weeks my mother got sick with CKD stage 3 - Doctors advised her to take the episode of dialysis twice in a week, she barely survived 3years with horrible episode of dialysis which is another war of muscle to tolerate, although she fought for her life but unfortunately couldn't recovered and leave this world on oct2021. During this time I took loan from relatives and friends more then 3-4million which is 15k-17k$ of US. I was completely depressed and suicidal thoughts had engulfed me like a spider Web, But then one of my friend said to get rid of this vicious cycle you have one solution which ecommerce, and then again I took another 2k$ from my friend- I spend 16-18 hours/day to learn the fba-PL model of amazon and after spending 3-4 months I make a partnership with a investor and we have launched our product in US in Beauty category, Initially we don't have sufficient orders and revenue PPC was eating our budget like a hungry lion, again we survive those months but to this day we are still in struggling phase and that struggling phase like never ending episode of amazon business. Now every relative and friend is asking for money which I have taken during my mom treatment but I don't have enough money to refund them which is highly disturbing for me and for my family. \n\nThe purpose of to write all this long story is I am looking for advice from OP as he has shared his story which is worth it to believe and inspire, I really like your business model and the revenue and profit you are making is very handsome. Would you please guide me through all this journey how can I get rid of this loan cycle and from where I should start this dropshipping model as I don't have single for now. Looking forward for your suggestions and guidance and I will really appreciate your response. \n\nThanks for reading !!",

Business is incredibly risky and stressful as it is and if you\u2019re depending on it to pay back debts and support your family from day 1, it\u2019s just going to be a brutal grind. Get a job, pay off your debts, save some cash, and then invest a portion of that into a business if that\u2019s what you still want to do. Wishing you all the best.",

Did you start with one and then get multiple products? If you're wary of local competition then do you sell online, locally or both? Do you use any advertising? Are your products season or a fad? Will you be able to continue to sell it in a year? Is this your product you designed and white labeled?\n\nYour post just makes it sound so simple. But doesn't really shed light into what's made you successful. Congrats on your success. I still don't understand how opening up an online e-commerce store is making people this kind of money but I am happy it is.",

Also, most of the time I see that people say it\u2019s not the product it\u2019s the work you put into it, marketing, etc, so if that is the case then I don\u2019t see how letting people know the product would hurt you if you think what you\u2019re doing is better than the competitions. \n\nMy question wasn\u2019t an attack, just wondering why all the vagueness and secrecy around the product as it comes off as slightly dishonest sometimes. Just my opinion though, I\u2019m happy for you that you\u2019ve found success so congratulations with what you\u2019ve done.",

Can you tell us what it is that you sell (not necessarily your brand, just the product i.e. knockoff designer handbags)? Do you only sell on Shopify or do you have your own website or sell thru any other platforms? How did you find your supplier (i.e. just an internet search or did you travel to china to meet with them in person)? How do you handle shipping/delivery now? What were your first year start up costs?",

    "postText": "I'm currently setting up a software business. Lately I found it very hard to work on this side project. I have a small child and we're expecting the next one soon. I also have a full time job. A tried working together with a cofounder but I still end up doing the majority of the work. Lately I felt no energy at all during the evenings to work on the business project. I'm wondering if anyone was in a similar situation and how you managed it.",

Plus a solid retirement account where keeping up with my plan wasn\u2019t a problem. \n\nLater in your career when you have senior management experience, a large network of CEO\u2019s and VP\u2019s to tap for employees / clients, and a large enough cash savings to last at LEAST a few years without worry, plus industry expertise to identify known problems that can be solved with your company, setting up a business is EASY. \n\nWait until everything is in place and you have the knowledge to execute and run a company successfully. Until then, focus on increasing your seniority, salary, retirement, and senior management experience in the meantime. \n\nDon\u2019t rush it and put your family\u2019s livelihood at stake while you roll the dice. I made sure our lifestyle could weather a storm, even IF my business completely failed. But like I said, I waited until I was prepared to the point that failure was a very small possibility.",

Take a couple of months off, with the first one to unwind and the rest to work on your project. \nSounds like you're having signs of burn out and that's not going to end well if you don't address it ASAP.\n\nAn alternative is arranging for shortened or flexible hours at your day job, so you can spend time on your side project.\n\nRegarding children, I hear you. There's no easy way to handle both parenthood and work towards financial independence. The balance my husband and I are trialing is for one person to be the constant breadwinner (me), kid gets sent to nursery, and the other person focuses on building a business.\nI am also expecting the second baby and will be on mat leave for a year (Europe), so we have come to terms with the fact that we will have to eat into our savings for a while, until we find our feet again. Acceptance has made a big difference! We have less than half the household income we had last year, but are consoled by the fact that it's all in function of a better long term. If things don't work out, we both go back to corporate, but knowing that we at least tried.",

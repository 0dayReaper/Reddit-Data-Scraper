That ended up costing me a lot of money in ads with no return.\n\nI am now onto my second app, an AI-powered Tailored cv writer, where you place your CV and the position, and it writes a custom CV with a cover letter.\n\nBut\n\nHow do I market this? \nAnd how do I know if people want it? \nSome indie creators suggest Reddit, but it seems pretty wrong to promote yourself.\n\nAnd should I validate before building?",

            "comment": "Maybe a little bit of marketing before actually building the product might help. It doesn't have to be complex, maybe just a landing page and a simple waitlist. This will not only help you test the people's interest in the idea but also help you test your own reach. This is what we discuss in our Micro SaaS HQ community too, especially if you have no audience and no online presence. Start with a simple landing page/MVP, then build a waitlist, then talk to users, and then build the product in parallel with marketing.",

Create a summary of what you believe the pain is, who experiences that pain, and how you COULD solve it.\n\n2. Publish this summary on a landing page\n\n3. Share your summary page with the people you think experience the pain most often by reaching out (Reddit, LinkedIn, Forums, etc...) -- these should be strangers, not friends.\n\n4. Based on feedback, refine your MVP &amp; ask them to join the waitlist.\n\n5. Once you have enough people on the waitlist that will generate a decent revenue, STOP taking feedback and build the MVP as fast as possible. (don't get distracted by more and more features...)\n\n6. Don't build a marketing funnel, build a marketing flywheel. While you're building the MVP keep your prospects excited by sharing frequent updates leading up to a LAUNCH PARTY Exclusive. Invite your audience to invite their friends to the waitlist. Incentivize them to invite friends by offering something special to everyone on the waitlist. This doesn't need to be much... maybe these users all get a special badge of honor when they login, maybe they get a special \"UI Skin\" that no one else gets, maybe it's a year of free upgrades, maybe their names are entered into a drawing for a big prize.... I dunno... but give them a reason to invite their friends or share on social media while you build the MVP. This should help the waitlist grow while you're working.\n\n7. Don't burn-out....Be brutal about your feature roadmap. If the feature doesn't directly relate to solving someone's pain... specifically a pain they would pay to solve... then it's not worth your time.\n\nI've written a little [more on the subject here](https://thejoshuastudio.com/a-tech-startups-guide-to-validating-a-product-before-building-it/) if you're interested.",

How do you intend to generate revenue? \n\nYou want to look at a few things, but at a minimum market size and propensity to buy. Id say you have a large market as unemployment is high, but that audience is also tight on cash high on time. So a large portion of the market would prefer to do it themselves than pay for it, or use something free with chatgpt + customization.\n\nBefore you build make sure your business makes sense and validate the market. I\u2019m not sure the business makes sense as anything more than a side project (unless you\u2019re collecting data to sell to indeed or something like that).",

And one of the suggestions from this writer was to tailor it every time.   \nThe logic behind it is if I can spend 10-300 and helps me land a +10k a year it's worth it.   \nNow I do agree with you its not for every market, but high paying jobs I do thinks its worth it.",

Don\u2019t take my suggestion as negativity rather than just making sure you think through the model. I personally hate that most everyone finds a reason not to do something rather than all the reasons to do it :)\n\nSome additional ideas for validation/building your first sign ups are to start a newsletter/social posting about how to craft a resume with a call to action to the landing page.\n\nRecruiting is big money - typically 20%+ of salary. So you can attack the market in a few ways.\n1. Sell to job seekers to help them get a job\n2. Sell to recruiters to save them time and money. Less time spent improving their candidates resumes to each employer the more time they have to recruit. If they can land one more job with a $100k salary that\u2019s $20k per year. You could easily charge $500/month for a service like that to an agency. You may also save them a salary or two which could be $50k+ savings.\n3. Become the recruiter yourself. Offer the tool to \u201cdo it yourself\u201d or a white glove recruiting service where you help them land jobs. If you land 5 ppl a job in a year that\u2019s $200k. Obviously easier said than done, but if your building the model it\u2019s worth thinking through how to attack the market in different ways. \n4. Target parents of recent graduates - they have money and they want their kids to land good jobs, but the job market has changed since they were active in it. You may be able to charge more to a parent than an unemployed person, and I feel like word of mouth would be stronger with parents if it\u2019s working for you. \n\nGood luck!",

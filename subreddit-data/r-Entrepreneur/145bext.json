    "postText": "A lot of talented people have things they really enjoy doing, but they don't know how to make money from them. \n\nGrowing up, I was shrouded by these people\u2014artists, photographers, pet lovers, etc.\u2014who dreamed of doing these things full time but never had the marketing experience to get noticed, \n\nSo I'm learning marketing to get more people to notice what they have to offer and bring in more money. This way, they can actually make a living doing what they love!\n\nBut I'm having trouble focusing. There are so many ways I can help that I don't know where to start. Is my niche too big, or should I just start with one thing to help them with?\n\u00a0\nI also don't know how to target such a large audience, especially with them not knowing that their marketing is missing. Most just think they are not talented enough.",

You're setting yourself up for failure if your goal isn't to learn to acquire customers for your own business. \n\nHere's why. \n\nThere are only a few major ad platforms in the world. \n\nNone of them are difficult to master. \n\nNone of them offer any sort of guarantee on your ability to make them work. They change from month-to-month and always for the worse. \n\nWhat ends up happening is that you end up in a low-barrier industry using products (ad platforms) you can't control and ultimately are at the mercy of algorithms and spend. \n\nYou are also the first to be fired. \n\nFind a better career, and I'm trying to be as transparent as possible, because marketing is saturated as fuck, everyone is an expert and no one can control any outcome.",

That's the nature of the market economy.\n\nBottom line is if you want to learn how to be a marketer, you should get some experience in marketing. You could probably go work for someone and learn the ropes.",

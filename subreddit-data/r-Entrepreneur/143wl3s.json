            "comment": "Being 17 and probably right out of high school, chances are slim that someone will hire you as a programmer or video editor since business owners have to invest heavily in training people this young and nobody wants to do that. \n\nIf you need money right now your best bet is getting a part time job and focus on your education. If you dream to become a programmer or editor in a short time you can do that by learning from the internet and practicing on your own in your free time, just know that it's going to be time consuming and hard at first. I did that when I was in college back in 2011, learned to code php websites from scratch for anyone who need it and since websites were all the rage back then I did pretty good for myself then transitioned to things like WordPress. \n\nI'm not sure how economy is in your country but it's a good thing that you are thinking of your career this early in your life, it puts you in a spot where you can choose to leave the country for better opportunities somewhere else or stay and help your people. \n\nAlso don't follow internet gurus for any career advice. \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

If you are new companies/agencies won't expect much from you their only focus will be your training so that you are beneficial to them. You'll work harder at first but once your skills develop you will reach your targets quick and then sit around watching netflix, I was in sales before starting my own agency, I know and I know people making \u20b9200k to 500k a month doing nothing in office cuz their over achieved their targets few days into the quarter.",

They care about the story and what you're about.\n\nNike is about running and sports, Gymshark is about body building, crossfit, calisthenics, Monster I'd about motocross and \"extreme\" sports, now including UFC.",

If your incremental cost of delivering the goods is almost nothing, then sure you can play up the value and then offer it for free if it doesn\u2019t work.  \n\nHowever, how do you offer 10x the value on a service business?  You can\u2019t realistically give someone $1000 of value on a lawn mowing or car detailing business for $49. \n\nYou also can\u2019t do $1000 of work that cost you $800 to deliver and then refund them if they aren\u2019t 100% satisfied. \n\nUltimately I liked the book but am still trying to think about how to apply it to my business. \n\nAlex\u2019s model was helping gyms get customers. He knew from experience if he did X he would get the outcome. So he could guarantee it and charge a high price.\n\nThis feels harder to apply to something like a retail store or online shop. Everyone of those businesses is different. Every customer is different. Every message is different. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I would apply his model to a t-shirt business. How do you play up $1000 of value on a physical product that people know what it costs. \n\nA small gym knows that 100 new customers paying $50/mo is $60k worth of annual profit at almost 100% margin. The cost of delivery is almost nothing but the fixed overhead. This doesn\u2019t apply for a tshirt.",

Ex: We\u2019ve used data to determine children need a new size about every x months. When your child outgrows it we\u2019ll send you another shirt (new or recycled options) and a reusable package where you can ship the previous version back for recycling.",

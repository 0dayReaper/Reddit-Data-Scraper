    "postText": "Hello! If this is the wrong place to ask, please redirect me :)\n\nI started an LLC with my state in spring 2022 with the intentions of doing e-commerce. When I set up the LLC, it asked for a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d, so I stated it as it was at the time. Since then, I have decided to instead go towards real estate investment with the business instead of e-commerce. \n\nIf I get a DBA to operate with the name of a new rental business, will I be able to do that under my original LLC even though the business purpose with the state is listed as e-commerce? Or will I have to create a new LLC to do real estate rentals? Any thoughts or advice is appreciated!",

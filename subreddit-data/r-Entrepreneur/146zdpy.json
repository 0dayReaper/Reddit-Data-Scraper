    "postText": "Three months ago, I started my own AI SaaS software company after quitting my job. I tried with a few different cofounders during this time, and even flew to different countries to meet them (although sadly most didn't work out).  Today, after 600+ cold email outreaches and weeks of coding, we finally landed our first paying customer!!!! It's definitely not enough to cover our living expenses but it definitely feels great which I felt like sharing.\n\nI've been lurking in this community for a while now, and some of the advice around here truly helped. I'm in no position to give advice yet, but personally the thing that worked well for me is finding talented people to work on something together. There is so much to do (especially in the early days) it is extremely easy to deprioritize important tasks just because you can't afford to spend time on it. Good luck!",

                    "comment": "So I realized there are tons of things to take care of, to list a few: building product (engineering), design (mainly visuals), marketing (the landing page, finding marketing channels and testing what resonates with people), sales (doing cold outreaches, which on average takes me around 6-10 minutes per email), finding cofounders, keeping track of finances, and some other small nuisances (exploring services that can help us work more efficiently, incorporating legal stuff)\n\nSo initially before i found my cofounders, my attention was being pulled in many different directions, which can be distracting and personally I meant I couldn't focus well on delivering one task well. For me, building product always came first but it comes with the cost of building without much validation. Finances were not properly managed,  I wasn't able to get the messaging clear with the landing page (which is [twilix.io](https://twilix.io)!), and sales outreach numbers weren't great.\n\nThis was a big problem because it meant I was wasting a lot of time running forward but not necessarily in the right direction. Honestly finding others to work with was the single best decision. There's a lot of conflicting advice online on whether you should approach people with an idea or brainstorm an idea together, for me I always approached with an idea because it was easier to convince people to quit their jobs this way. Not sure which industry you're in but hope this helped!",

So while my cofounder continued on building product, I switched by focus to sales to really bring up the momentum and excitement of the team. \n\nAs for the sales outreach, the conversion rates were tough for us. I went after other startups because of the nature of our product (self served AI dev tools) and the shorter sales cycle, but essentially reply rate was around 5%, and each subsequent step in the sales funnel also experienced big drop-off rates. I read online that most people aren't early adopters so these numbers are required, I would say don't lose faith but also keep an eye out on whether the product is actually something people would pay for. Are you also in this space?",

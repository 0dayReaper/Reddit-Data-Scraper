You may join freelancing platforms like upwork and fiverr where there is a lot of demand for video editors. You may also start your own YouTube channel but it will be a tough few months for you on YouTube before you start making some money so you have to be patient. When you join upwork and fiverr, you should also be patient there because you never know when you first order will come. It may come in the first couple of days or it may take a few weeks.",

    "postText": "I started a coffee brand that\u2019s aimed towards Devs and other techies. Within launching I had my first order at 18.99 !!! \n\nWords can not express the excitement and joy I was going through for that first sale. I have tried different things in the past and I never had a sale happen before so seeing this for the first time was something else. In a way it feels addicting. I sometimes open up my live view Shopify store and watch when a visitor is there to see if another order will go through. Making a few bucks through your own business vs working for someone else is a day and night difference. \n\nTo all those who are also starting out just like me I wish you guys the best and hope you get to experience this feeling soon. Everyone deserves to have a chance.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you everyone for the feedback and kind words. I will work on fixing some of the things you guys pointed out like better pictures today hopefully. \n\nFor those asking for the link of the site it\u2019s leetbrew.com\n\nI was blessed to get my second order today recently and almost in tears from support you guys have shown. This subreddit feels like a family and I wish each and every single one of you the amount of joy I have experienced these past 2 days",

Same goes for your customers, they had great coffee for the last months, years or whatever they'll need a reason and it's down to your website to give em that reason. So every now and then work on putting valuable content on your website. \n\nI drink coffee and often like the stories behind the blends I'm buying, maybe you could do a story on each blend you have I.e coffee X is grown and harvested in ......, it has ..... flavour, grown at altitude... the community which grows them... what you do to them in-house before packaging them etc\n\nMaybe make a blog highlighting the flavours you have and what they offer. This all sounds long but it definitely helps push buyers further down the buying chain.",

There are roasters who will put your label on their beans and work with you that way. There are some you just have to buy directly from and then package it yourself but that requires more startup cost which doesn\u2019t make sense for me right now. There are just too many different flavors and types to experiment with in the beginning so finding one that is established and will work with you is probably the better way to go in the beginning",

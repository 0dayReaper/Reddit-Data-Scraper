One way to deal with this though is to set expectations before you start your business and basically call it quits or pivot if those expectations aren\u2019t met. \n\nEx. If after 6 months I don\u2019t have X amount of sales, with a spending limit of $5,000 (meaning during this time I will not exceed this limit) then I will close the business or pivot. \n\nI think this is a good way to limit yourself from burning cash on a business that won\u2019t work. You can also have points where you stop and make changes and try to see what isn\u2019t working (and maybe why). Like after one month see if you\u2019ve made any sales, if not try to make changes and find out why, and you repeat that until you hit your max time and spending limit",

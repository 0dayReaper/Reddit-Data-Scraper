    "postText": "Hello, Reddit community! I need your help in finding a business idea that allows me to make a positive impact while supporting my family. I have a background in turning around a failing restaurant and experience in merchant cash advance sales, but I'm looking for something more fulfilling. Can you provide ideas that help others and improve lives?\n\n\nI successfully transformed a struggling restaurant into a thriving one, and I have experience in merchant cash advance sales. However, I'm not satisfied with the moral aspects of that industry. I want to start something that genuinely helps people and makes their lives better.\n\nI'm reaching out to this supportive community for guidance. Do you have any suggestions for a business that allows me to contribute to others' well-being while providing for my family comfortably?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm grateful for any ideas or advice you can offer. My goal is to find a business that allows me to make a positive impact on people's lives while ensuring the financial stability of my family. I'm excited to hear your suggestions. Thank you!",

If u found a idea/concept you really love, you can use the market analysis tool to explorer the market potential of your ideas as well as find and understand any competitors in that space.\n\nI hope the tool can be helpful to you. If u have any questions feel free to reach out at gordon-at-ideationfuture.com",

It's wonderful to hear that you're not just looking to make a profit, but also to make a positive impact on the world. And most of the time, these two things have a funny way of supporting each other.  \nConsidering your background in turning around a struggling restaurant, perhaps you could consider consulting for small local businesses that are having difficulties. Not only would you be able to apply your existing skills, but you could also make a real difference in your community by helping to keep these businesses afloat. You might even be able to incorporate a training component, teaching essential skills to business owners and employees.  \nIn my own journey, I've come to realise that entrepreneurship is not a straight path but a journey filled with unexpected turns and detours. Often, our unique blend of personal experiences, talents, and passions leads us to entrepreneurial opportunities that we might never have considered otherwise. I write daily about my experiences, I am pursuing a tech start up, I have a newsletter that tries to blend these things, [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe), and I always keep my eyes and ears open to opportunities where I can help people. I try to keep balls in the air so that if one falls, many are still juggling.  \nBest of luck on your journey, and remember to stay open to unexpected possibilities! It is in these where amazing opportunities could form.",

So, I would consider leveraging this talent in a closely-related business or industry.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, if you can turn a business around, you should also be capable of helping to start one up.\r  \n\r  \nOnce you have worked both sides, you could straddle the fence and given opinion of value.",

That\u2019s the kind of shit you have to make it through to build something. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and it\u2019s like Snow White with the birds making your bed and shit, but it probably won\u2019t be.   You\u2019ll have plenty of moments where you say \u201cfor fucks sake, I can wake up before sunrise and have tea anytime I want and I can get a job I don\u2019t hate and sleep at night better without the stress of it all.\u201d   And indulging that wouldn\u2019t be the wrong thing at all, it\u2019s just a different path. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is be realistic.

It's basically a solid at room temp, have to heat it in the oven for an hour (or more depending on batch size) or so at low temperatures, otherwise the terpenes you add for flavoring before filling will evaporate. Generally a liter takes around 2+ hours to heat to a workable temp (160-180 degrees). \n\nYou need to find a terpene supplier, i have an underground source via past stuff. Mass Terps is a reliable place though (Terps cost more than disty) You mix terps anywhere between 5-8%, so say youre making 1000 carts of a certain flavor profile, itd be 50-80ml of terps to 920-950 ml of D8 distillate.   \n\nIf you really want to make big money buy bulk CBD isolate and build a lab to convert the CBD&gt;Delta 8 and get it analyzed so you have a certificate of analysis (COA)\n\nThat's my next step, as the CBD costs around 100 bucks a kilo. The d8 distillate sells in bulk for ~1500 a liter. If you have an established cart business you've just made your margins 10000% instead of 1000%. \n\n\nInitial investment of around 5 grand will get you started. I already had a network so was easy to start. Having a website would also help exponentially and will be my next step after lab setup.\n\n\nEdit: Feel free to hmu via pm, that goes for anyone here.",

Lots of country corner stores and cbd/glass shops  Why i really enjoy deliveries, full price. \n\nKeep about ten flavors ready to rock, 250+ on hand for each. Takes ~1 hour (not including preheating) to fill cap about 200 but that's with help, easily 2-3x that on your own. \n\nPrice to shop depends on how much they get  gone regularly/decide to consign on a monthly basis/if we're friends or not. Drew up a credit contract to where after a month they have to pay regardless of sales. But yeah the price varies wildly, like from 9.50-25  \n\nWith bulk distillate/empties being ~$1g and $1.75 empty per cart, with terps and packaging added it's right around $3.15 for each fully packaged. So where 1000 filled carts takes about 5 hours of work and costing ~3150-3500 to produce (with labor) netting anywhere from 9500-25k+(more with full price deliveries.)\n\nThe hard part is selling them admittedly, market is increasingly saturated. Go through ~3k a month. \n\n it's not bad (at all imo), but my original major point was that I'm still ridiculously depressed regardless of all of that.",

UARS can have no symptoms, or many symptoms, or a few. You can so a home WatchPAT study for a few hundred bucks, or a proper sleep study but make sure they score RDI and RERA values before you go, and get that information.\n\nCould be nutritional or hormonal, good idea to get a panel for both. General health checkup?\n\nYou might have a faulty MTHR gene which you can take two supplements for and it'll resolve mood issues. Get a genetic test like 23andMe and then run it through promothease. \n\nVitamin D deficiency is common and some countries and services incorrectly tell you you're fine. Could be worth trying 4000IU Vitamin D3 for like a month..\n\nCould be a few other things. But I'd get a health check, genetic check, sleep check.

And I understand the cost side of things, that anxiety is reasonable. Let's see:\n\n23andMe for genetic data, Promethease to analyse it. Under $100, one off cost. \n\nSupplements that you aren't sure on are likely a waste of time but Vit D deficiency is a common cause of mental health issues. \n\nA hormone and nutrition panel just once, asking for a copy of the results, is worth it if you can afford it. But  you could maybe just skip to eating healthy. A really easy, cheapish, low-effort way to cover everything is a meal replacement shake like Huel or it's competitors. They can taste great (and you can blend whatever you want in). Huel has protein, good fats, optionally some carbs. It also has fibre and phytonutrients, some other stuff, all of your nutrients, obviously calories, it's almost no sugar (tiny tiny amount), vegan, and fairly cheap. \n\nSoylent is a US thing that's pretty similar. If you like the idea I'll find the best brand close to you! Some people drink only huel and water, no food. You can just have it as a snack or for breakfast or something and eat more veggies. \n\nWatchPAT home sleep study is a few hundred bucks. Fixing a sleep disorder will be the best thing possible for your mental health, it'll be causing the majority of your issues if you don't have anothed underlying massive cause. If you don't have it, initial test will be a one off cost.\n\nFinally, if life sucks it can help to make everyday things easier. If you're technically minded, or know someone who is, you can automate things in your home. It's expensive but a roborock vacuum, or a small dishwasher you just run often, things like that. For whatever reason when I'm down and brain foggy and struggling, dishes or vacuuming is such a mountain to tackle. Now I can just say \"not today\" and press a few buttons. Dishes are clean. Vacuum is done to a satisfactory degree (but can't eliminate that deeper clean you'll do every month or few months or whatever).\n\nAlways here if you want advice or a chat or vent or anything!",

I'm not suggesting that you spiral into a soulless daily grind but if your anxiety stems from needing to finish a project, send that uncomfortable email, finish a proposal, button up a business plan, whatever... use that energy and get it done.  And try to enjoy it.  Be proud of your hard work.  \n\nIn my opinion, it's the same mentality of \"make your bed every morning to feel accomplished..\" except it's not fluff to make you feel better once per day.  The freedom that comes from finishing that task is amazing.  We're built to/ supposed to feel anxious about responsibilities before we allow ourselves to have fun.  Use it.  Stay up late, wake up early.  Be productive at whatever time of day inspires you and enjoy the \"down time\" that comes with your to-do list being just a little shorter.  \n\nOnce again, there is a healthy and unhealthy interpretation of this and my message is not \"grind and hustle bro\".  However, don't let the internet's opinion of \"work-life-balance\" stop you from working as hard as you feel you \"should\" or \"need to\".  The fact that you find it uncomfortable to relax when you haven't \"earned\" it (I cant think of a better way to word that at the moment) gives me the impression that you're asking reddit permission to work harder or work more hours than you think you're \"supposed\" to.  \n\nAll that said, everything happens only one day at a time.  No matter how hard you work, there are only so many hours in a day.  My favorite reminder on a daily basis is \"if it were easy, everyone would do it\".  All you can do is keep doing the next thing.

We could set off new values, beliefs, principles, and laws that never existed before through our imagination. Everything we have invented and discovered is a result of our imagination. Our species' unique ability to co-operate in a large number is possible because of our ability to imagine collectively. Our imagination is what makes our species so unique. \n\n  \nYour past experiences decide how you will imagine things, which sets up your values and beliefs. Our values and beliefs are what separate us from others. Also, they are responsible for setting up the type of work and type of person you will like. Our values and beliefs are so powerful that whenever you go against them, it's going to feel wrong. We call it \"intuition.\" It's like when you go on a date, and it goes really well. The other person seems really cool. Yet you don't know why but the person just doesn't feel right. While consciously you don't know the reasons, your subconscious mind knows pretty well that the person's values and beliefs don't go well with yours. \n\n  \nAs our values and beliefs set up the type of work we will like, it's really important to know about ourselves. It's really important to recall your major past experiences that may have contributed to building your personality. It's really important to know what you care about. The reason many of us just want to earn enough to relax the rest of our lives is that we are not happy with our current lifestyle. And the reason we are not happy is that our current lifestyle doesn't go well with our values and beliefs. If your work makes you tired from the inside, then, of course, you need to know yourself first. \n\n  \nWe may think that we already know ourselves. Simply ask yourself why you are doing the work you are doing. If the answer is money, then you need to think again. Because money is the result of belief and effort, it's not a reason to do something. If you cannot think of a solid answer, then you got to look back to your major past experiences and find out your core values and beliefs. You can try reading these two books, \"Start with Why\" and \"Find Your Why.\"",

I have a great day job that pays really well, just bought my first house with my partner, have a great family, but I don't feel that I can relax and enjoy any of it to the fullest until I have given my side business the absolute best chance at success. I am fine with failing, but not ok with not trying my best.",

Continue to appreciate your family, partner &amp; friends.\n\nWhen your time comes, maybe about 10% of your thoughts will be about your come-up story and successful career. But I promise you this, majority of the thoughts will be about your experiences and how you lived life to the fullest with your family and friends.\n\nIn this day and age, you don't need to become a multi-millionaire to live good.",

    "postText": "A question for those who went for selling their courses on their own platforms rather than going for the usual Udemies etc, how did you go about it? Do you have anything to recommend with preferably low/no price to get started? Preferably I'm talking about a platform that would handle all the stuff - the landing page, the email list, a seamless payment system and taking care of all the stuff like GDPR. There are a ton of solutions for that like Teachable, Podia, Kajabi, not to mention the possibility of integrating different services like Elementor for the website + Stripe for payment, or Clickfunnels etc. It's pretty overwhelming really and I wouldn't want to go for something that takes an outrageous cut out of my earnings or that locks me in their ecosystem and then makes me bleed money to stay there, or that is notorious for doing weird stuff.\n\nAny recommendations, personal accounts of your experiences there?",

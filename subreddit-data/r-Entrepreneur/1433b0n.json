    "postText": "I used to work in Finance, however, I now work in Healthcare. \n\nIt always seemed to me that there could be a way to use financial derivatives such as futures, options, or swaps to hedge or reduce costs to the end consumer. \n\nI'm assuming there are people way smarter than me out there who have thought of this and came to the conclusion there is not a valid way to do this otherwise the market would have figured it out already. \n\nJust kind of throwing this idea out there in a desperate attempt to see if somebody ever thought of this or could add some input. \n\nTIA!",

I could only imagine, what if you could wear a VR headset and inside you see your upcoming healthcare costs and with a click of a button, it gets reduced. Unfortunately, it seems healthcare providers don't care about the end consumer as much as the stockholders.",

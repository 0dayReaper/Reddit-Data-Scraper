    "postText": "We're a tiny 2-person indie game studio and we are looking to launch our mobile game. We thought it'd be a good idea to start building our community before we publish the app so that we can create some hype around it. \n\nWe knew it'd be a grind, but working to attract a couple of community members everyday is taking a toll. We've reached \\~400 members on Discord but a lot of them are spammers/scammers and other dubious people who are trying to sell us their services. There are some real users in there too and we appreciate that, but the pace at which we grow is not what we would have hoped for. \n\nOur campaign included post series on all popular SM, engaging with users in the comments and most other common practices, but it's been tough. We try to avoid promoters and influencers because they charge a ton for very little results. At the current pace, it will take a couple of months to reach our most modest goals.   \n\n\nThe marketing costs we have are manageable, and besides the extra hype &amp; motivation it'd offer us, there's not much we're losing by going at this pace. However, I'd love to know how you guys managed to keep a positive attitude and not give in to the lack of motivation or trust in your project's success? How did you get over this slump?",

I remember when Harry Stebbings, author of 20VC, said he needed to record 600 podcast episodes to reach 1k listeners per episode. 600 interviews, 2 years!\n\nBesides that, I think it\u2019s important to look for growth and sticky ideas to create a snowball effect. I'm not in the gaming industry but I'm sure there are a lot of \u2018network effects\u2019 you could implement.",

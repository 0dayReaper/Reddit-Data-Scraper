A lot of business owners and managers would benefit *greatly* from learning the concepts of environment and system design.  Build the system itself to passively encourage the behaviors you want, discourage the behaviors you don't, and produce the outcomes you expect.\n\nThe most common example is the traditional sales commission model.  You don't get great results from a salesperson that works on straight salary.",

                    "comment": "I'm not questioning your sincerity, but I think you're restating the same thing that OP did, just from a different perspective or spin.\n\nWhen you say: \"Employees are investments and if you pick the right one and let them grow, it will pay dividends in the future\" - that to me can read the same as OP's post in the way that \"employees are a cost that need to produce revenue and profit to justify their cost, and the more profit they generate, the better it is for the company.  And if you can keep their cost down, then that improves the profit margins even further.\"\n\nI just don't see anything in your statement about re-routing some of that profit back to the employee.  And that's how much of our capitalist system is set up - workers are paid a wage for their labor, not for the profits they generate.  So it's not about \"letting them grow\" as if we are some benevolent gardeners caring for them.  It's about extracting as much productivity out of them and leveraging as much of their labor into revenues and profit.   Nowhere in that equation do I read anything \"and so that they may share in the profits from their work.\"\n\nSure great employees may be \"rewarded\" by being promoted and paid a higher wage - but that's actually for the benefit of a company to position great workers into positions where they can be even more productive as leaders or managers to drive productivity over more employees.  But I think OP's point remains valid that within that structure, an employee's growth in the company remains a cost, and costs fundamentally always remain a chief object of scrutiny by management as a factor to minimize however possible.\n\nThe true fundamental divide is what is an employee?  An employee is paid for labor as a fixed cost - as an hourly wage or fixed salary, with perhaps some bonus structure tied in to incentivize money brought in.  However, in that structure, the employee is not given true equity, profit, and partnership in the company in most cases.  There are exceptions where you can get profit sharing plans, bonuses paid relating to profits, and even stocks and stock options, but those remain both rare, and still budgeted in a cost-basis way rather than integrating an employee into a true \"co-owner\" status of a company.",

The goal is to drive ROI, which is not limited to cutting costs. For example:\n\n* Spending more money to get employees better training will increase costs but (hopefully) drastically increase value. \n* Giving employees access to preventative healthcare will cost more, but decrease the sick time they take (aka, they'll work more, and you'll get more value)\n* Work place perks cost more, but the hope is they improve employee morale, resulting in increased productivity\n\nOP took a myopic view of leaderships/organizations IMO.",

Sure when you own a billion dollar company and you literally have no more input in the day to day and are essentially retired, you don't have that worry, but the VAST majority of business owners are not in that position. \n\nThat being said, the title of this post is exactly the wrong way to think of it. If you're a shitty boss, then yes, people are just expenses. If you realize they are an asset, you'll find a way to make them happy/pay them fairly while also keeping the business profitable.\n\nThere is a tradeoff to be made. Some people really just like to be able to punch out and not think about work. They're happy having that delineation. For that, they're willing to make a salary less than that of the owner. There's nothing wrong with either type - people just have different priorities.",

The safest path to true wealth still is excelling in a corporate job. There are a million reasons to own a business - looking at it as a path to financial independence is not one of them. \n\nThe answer only changes once you start getting into the $50 million plus range. \n\nBut getting to a net worth of 5-10 million dollars is significantly easier in a corporate job than it is through entrepreneurship.",

You\u2019ll see these \u201centrepreneurs\u201d throwing money at hair brained ideas, come to me or other bankers when they are tight on cash and expect us to lend on a 3 year track record of declining revenues and declining net profit or even 3 years of losses. The numbers will say they cannot service the debt they are requesting or any debt most of the time. Then they beat their chest about how we don\u2019t understand \u201cthe grind.\u201d I\u2019m well aware there are some companies that stuck it out and succeeded after many years of not being profitable. \n\nI think the problem with many entrepreneurs today is everyone is looking for the homerun. Everyone wants a company that explodes, even investors in places like SV and NY. However, this leads everyone building unsustainable business models and neglecting some truly good ideas that are profitable, but they may not have that explosive potential. You don\u2019t have to triple and quadruple profits to be successful. 10% growth per year is respectable and sustainable. \n\nMost entrepreneurs today also are looking to be disruptive. It is the sexy thing to talk about. No one wants to go into established industry and just get really good at something. I knew a guy who went in and bought a tire store in a small town. He spruced the place up and made sure it was managed well and has now branched out to several other towns. He didn\u2019t invent anything, he didn\u2019t disrupt, he didn\u2019t change the industry, he simply applied sound business principles to an average business and it is now a very profitable venture. \n\nI don\u2019t say all of this to discourage innovation or to tell you to go into the tire business. What I am saying is if you are looking for opportunity sometimes it is merely improving or restoring something that already exists. \n\nDon\u2019t dismiss ideas because it has already been done. More importantly, failure is important, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should keep pouring money and time into bad deals.",

I think that's worth the sacrifice.\n\nI've told my wife these past 5 years, I'm not going to work for anyone, corporate America is gone, the jobs won't be coming back, and the ones that remain people are becoming over worked, under paid, miserable and unappreciated. Less time with family, less time with kids. What good is money if you have little to no time to enjoy it? Life isn't supposed to be about working for 65 years and retiring for 11 if you're lucky you make it that long. Pensions are gone, health care is disappearing and full time jobs are being turned into 35 hr part timers. If I'm going to sacrifice and kill myself working I'm going to do it for my own company. The instant gratification trap is slavery. It sucks looking at everyone make it seem like they're happy with their white picket fences on Facebook and happy little families at chuckie cheeses, but deep down all you're really doing is working and dying.

Rich is when you can take family to vacation in Switzerland for a month, or go live in Florida in the winter time.  Henries make good salary but they also spend good amount of money on mortgages and child care and colleges tuitions and all that fancy stuff.  The society call them \"middle class\" - just slaves to higher lords.\n\nDoctors work is very boring.  You sit there all day and graduate when you are 38.  Good paying lawyers mostly \"lie for a living\" and if it does not violate your conscience then yeah it is a good job.  C-level suites are the first ones to get fired during the COVID season - where as the line men keep theirs.  Engineers are the E in Henry.  Highest paying Engineers are in silicon valley where average housing price is four million dollars.\n\nAnd yes, everyone works for the bank.  Everyone works for the land owner.  Stop self pitying. Just work your way up.\n\nDuring the COVID season, one group of people keep paying the employees and keep paying the land lords rents - even when there is no business for half a year.  they are called the owners, the \"rich people\".\n\nActually, if you want to be really rich, own land and lease it.  it is the best in the world.  It is income whether it is good times or bad times.  Yeah, own land.  Own properties, like in the monopoly game. :-)",

And other tenants would do the same?. \nSure its one of the most effortless things you can do to have an income, but the risks are quite high sometimes unless you are one of the primary owners that got that property at a really low price. \n\nOtherwise you risk getting stuck with a large sum of money that cant be moved easily, and potentially can just devaluate in a couple weeks with nothing that you could do to save yourself from that (unless you put that property to work for you as an asset for some other business).",

Lobbyists petition successfully for new broom regulations which drive competitors out of the market. More factories go bust, but the employees find new careers as network analysts and hairdressers, I guess?\n\n\"Brooms, Consolidated\" starts contracting with the military, providing mil-spec brooms at $500 each. Stocks soar more, and the CEO buys their fifth yacht and fiftieth politician. No brooms are ever delivered, but the contract is continually renewed during yearly golf trips for military brass. \n\nThe CEO buys an island, but needs money to build a mansion on it. He convinces the executive board to harvest the brand and turn a blind eye to quality to drive down costs. A strike at the Laotian factory is put down violently, resulting in a few dozen dead child laborers. Their parents say nothing, fearing reprisal, and sign an indemnity contact for $200 and guaranteed jobs for their remaining children. Production continues until a new factory can be set up in China. The Laotian workers never receive their final paycheck as the factory moves. \n\nBut hey, the CEO's eight-figure bonus builds quite the chateaux. There's even a sex dungeon for some transferred Laotian employees. This eventually lands the executive before a judge, but the case is dismissed as none of the Laotian children have standing in the island's jurisdiction. \n\nThe company celebrates it's fiftieth anniversary.

Ultimately, people are greedy, whether it is capitalistic \"America\" or \"socialistic\" China.  \"Scalably getting rich\" takes some cold heart.  This thing you are talking about is spreading all over the world I believe.  The senators can print money ... actually that is the best on earth.  So they get off too easy.\nThe CEO who gets quintupling salary is the key link that broke.  The BOARD made a bad decision, perhaps because the CEO knows some dirty laundry of the company.  In the United States, corporates are treated as individuals \"politically\" - this is unfair.  No individual can be so loud mouthed.\nIt is therefore a failure of political system and democracy, not just economics, but it belongs to another Reddit group.  Eventually it will be corrected by a forth coming \"French Revolution\" that reveals the last episode of the \"industry revolution\".  Then a new weird cycle of some sort will start for another 400 years.",

Let's say your company is IPOed and listed on Nasdaq, but some brokers wants to short your stock collectively - you need to beat that and fight the mafia.\nA company's valuation can change by 100 million in a day due to conspiracy - the CEO needs to stop that - it is his job.  Let's say your competitor flys a fake news in the paper that your owner is \"taken to police station for questioning\", it is not true and has no basis, but you would need to deal with it.\nSometimes a small startup can threaten you.  The CEO needs to buy the small company and kill it.  That is not easy to figure out fare price.\nI know a CEO of a cemetery equipment company, Nasdaq listed.  They spent all day dealing with a rogue CTO, and stays in Motels on travel.\nA CEO is still an employee, not an owner.

If you run a fleet of taxis, you want to keep an eye on maintenance and depreciation expenses, but if you run a tech company, R&amp;D is also an expense but the more you invest in the expense, the more of a return you get.\n\nSecond, while salaries are an expense, employees are an asset. Same if you don't keep up with the maintenance expenses for your taxis, you won't have those taxis for very long, the same is true for your employees. If you don't pay them fairly, you won't have those employees for long.\n\nThird, employees salary should be proportional to the value they produce. It's entirely possible to get rich off of salary. Look at investment bankers and corporate lawyers. They produce lots of value (either through direct value or by mitigating costs), they are highly  trained, and not  very interchangeable. You won't get rich by salary if you are doing a low skill, highly interchangeable task. This is probably the most important point. Even if you start a company, if you are doing low value work in a highly competitive market, you probably won't get rich either.\n\nAnd lastly, the vast majority of entrepreneurs don't get rich either. Entrepreneurship has the highest risk exposure. Successful businesses owners are compensated for assuming the risk of owning a business. Salary is far more reliable and predictable.\n\nIn summary, you'll often see at plenty of start ups that the founders are not the most well payed person at the company, and unless the company really succeeds, they are not going to be the wealthiest person down the road either.",

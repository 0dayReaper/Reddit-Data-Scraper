    "postText": "I have been paying $490 per week for a standard but really nice SUV with enterprise for the last 6 weeks and will have to do so for another 6 weeks. I noticed enterprise is usually all booked so it got me wondering, why not fill the gap? DMV area, mostly (near or around DC area though so Baltimore County to Northern VA near Dulles).\n\nSo here\u2019s the plan\n\nStart off with 1 EV, Tesla model 3 Long Range with no full self driving ($50,380, $7500 tax incentive + $3000 state incentive). Then slowly scale up to Rivan R1S SUV ($80-90k) and the Cybertruk.\n\n$80 daily rate (Monday - Thursday)\n\n$150 daily rate (Friday - Sunday) \n\nLoyalty program\n\n-$100 p/m or rent for 10 weeks or longer per year to qualify\n\n-$60 p/d rate \n\nOptional add-ons\n\n+ $15 p/d for insurance \n\n+ $100 for pickup/drop off at xyz location\n\n+ $1.99 p/d or $10 p/m for Tesla connectivity  \n\n\nCustomer acquisition \n\n- online ads - $3.5 CPC, $15 CPM, \n\n- 12.5% referral payout per rental\n\n- online platforms such as turo, hyrecar, Ubers new platform\n\n- partnership agreements with local businesses\n\n\n$630 weekly rate ($90 p/day) if booked 24 hours in advance, $700 for instant booking\n\nRideshare option - renter can use for Uber or Lyft \n\nFood delivery option - renter can use for Dominos or Doordash or Uber Eats, etc\n\nUS business mileage tax deduction- $0.65. \n\nAssuming mostly rideshare drivers use me and the car is driven at least 100 miles per day, 36,500 miles * $0.65 = $23,725 back in taxes\n\nAssuming I rent daily at my lowest price of $80, that\u2019s $29,200 gross per vehicle. \n\n$29,200 * 0.60 (40% tax) = $17,520 gross\n\n$50,380 - $10,000 down payment = $40,380 \n\n$40,380 @ 10% interest, 48 months = $1,024.14 monthly\n\nI want to pay the car off in 24 months\n\nAfter 12 months, my balance will be $31,739.40\n\n$31,739.40 - $7500 federal EV credit - $3,000 state EV credit = $21,739.40\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to calculate the mileage deduction so I\u2019ll leave that out as extra income. I used to do Uber and Lyft and $200-300 after Uber fees working a day are realistic. I have also done Dominos which pays out $13 p/hr and has unlimited overtime if you are willing to close, you can seriously do 70 hours OT (10am to 2am) but your only driving half or 1/3 of the time, plus $350 tips, so your looking at $1000+ per week working 10-12 hrs daily, $1700 if your willing to slave away. The difference in electric vs gas is pretty significant. That cost savings could result in 50% savings. For example I was spending $50 daily to fill up with Uber (250-400 miles) and about $25 with dominos (120 miles). \n\nI\u2019m also calling up local repair shops and dealerships and businesses to offer my cars as loaners. Repair shops and dealers seem resistant though, they hate EVs. Dealerships in my area charge $50 per day for rentals while cars are being serviced. Not sure about how to contact insurance companies though. \n\n\nSo what do you guys think? Target market are gig workers who are all in for the most part, with some sprinkling of one off customers whether from partnering businesses or google ads, etc.",

            "comment": "Alright, here's the problem:  you need to target companies not people.  Target companies that travel often and are green initiative companies, get some funding either through a loan or through a VC.  This business model is profitable depending on how much it is to replace the batteries and lifetime, but idk anything about that.  Clearly profitable companies are easy to fund.\n\nValidation should be done by interviewing potential customers, and figure out which ones would be a best fit, also interviewing individuals if you disagree with me on target market (totally valid, I'm a random internet person)  and figure out your avatar from there.",

I'm from Ecuador and here when uber came out it became fairly popular to buy Chevy Aveo's and Sparks, take a foreign that drives well and can show some documents, and rent it out to that driver per day. \n\nThat was the most common model. 1 friend even tried it &amp; ended up having his car scratched by the driver within the first year. \n\nWhen Ecuador decided to remove the subsidiary on gasoline, the prices went up for everyone and many of these uber business's tanked. \n\nNow the common model that has survived is people having their own car &amp; ubering.",

            "comment": "I've seen an increasing number of EVs on Turo, and I've also seen small fleet rental business popping up on Turo.  Given Turo is basically a car rental service for the gig economy, where the firm handles most of the opex-related tasks for you, it seems like a reasonable way to make a buck if you live in an area where you can count on consistent business or tourism rental.  My experience is that Turo prices are about the same as rental companies, but the variety of vehicles you can get is much broader (with prices to match, at both ends of the spectrum).\n\nAnother small business idea is to buy and rent EVs to full time Uber/Lyft drivers.  The last time I flew, I was picked up by a guy in a brand new Tesla Model 3 and we got to talking.  Turns out he moved out of his townhouse and into a 1br apartment.  He rents the townhouse, used the money to lease two Prius EVs, which he then rents out to full time drivers.  So within a year, he basically went from \"guy with normal job living in townhouse\" to \"landlord + owner of two add'l revenue generating vehicles driving meaningful passive income\".",

            "comment": "Find and research the Turo subreddits. Many Turo businesses that expanded too far are on fire. It\u2019s a tough business. You are focusing too much at made up figures that don\u2019t match the current model. A single entity can not carry the needed insurance to be able to offer renters an insurance option or collision damage waiver without that policy eating all profits. Hence you need a Turo or similar. \nOne of my businesses rents commercial trucks. It\u2019s a good model up until the point where it isn\u2019t. Tons of liability and pitfalls that can make all profits vanish. Reach out of you have specific questions.",

            "comment": "Love your enthusiasm! That\u2019s half the battle.\n\nTwo things to think about: first, you haven\u2019t said what your war chest is. How much do you have, in cash, in the bank to start this and in your list I hope I didn\u2019t miss $10 million in liability insurance (which is surprisingly cheap if that sounds scary to anybody).\n\nAnd the second thing is you don\u2019t mention previous businesses \u2013 no successes or failures. So with three failures and three successes under my belt I would say first do a normal business. Anything that isn\u2019t something you just thought up. Retail, online, brick and mortar, service, food, *anything* that lots of people are successfully doing. Then, while that is running, start something crazy that sounds great but might not be.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve had an idea for a business and I wanted to get some opinions here regarding its feasibility. So as a kid my dad brother and I built trails together (think board walk sections, mulch, gravel, fully built out steps). It was one of my fondest memories and as I\u2019ve grown up I find myself walking the trails we made and enjoying nature a lot more then I might have otherwise. \n\nThis leads me to my question being could this be a form of landscaping business? I\u2019ve considered adding tree labeling to this as understanding tree species has become an interest of mine largely due to these trails. It\u2019s also worth noting I live in a hcol rural area.",

Have you done research as to what kind of demand there would be?\n\nI could see some of it being done with clients that have large backyards. Either way, I wish you the best with your venture.",

Adding tree labeling is a smart move too. Not sure about the feasibility, but it's worth exploring. Good luck with your venture!",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nVery new to this subreddit but inspired to start somewhere. I'd like to pick the brain of those of you who have experience with the e-commerce industry and buying/selling/maintenance of said industry. \n\nWhen is buying an existing e-commerce site worth it and for how much? For example, an e-commerce site under a year old through shopify, making roughly 20k a month in profit? How much would you list it for as the seller and how much would you buy it for a s a buyer? Might be a stupid question but I'd like to get a picture of pricing from experienced buyers/sellers. \n\nThanks in advance!",

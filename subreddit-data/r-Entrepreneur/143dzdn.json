    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nI just received 20k and am wondering what to do with it. I\u2019m working a crappy entry level job (graduated in may of 22) where I\u2019m making 1k weekly. Looking to turn this 20k into 30k and so on. \n\nI work as a contractor for a large tech company, it\u2019s fine but definitely underpaid and not what I want to do be doing in the long run. I live in Tampa, Florida and am looking for anything to escape this brutal 9-5. I know 20k isn\u2019t life changing, but looking for any tips or ideas here. Thanks guys!",

Travel is rarely regretted, although I recommend exploring people, places and cultures over booze and a beach.\n\nIf you want to make a few dollars investing it, then shop around mutual funds that can beat inflation. Starting a nest egg with 20k in savings is good. Pay down debt if you can.\n\nAvoid people telling you how you can make 50% or more on a 20k investment because they\u2019re most likely thieves.\n\nGood luck!",

I started with. 10k and made over 200k in the markets past 3 years. My best trades were under 3k a positions. So having 20k is nice ya don\u2019t need all of it. \nI\u2019d study stocks and options and paper trade in your head or start off very small with $100 every so often to trade and learn from that. Try to turn $200 into 1k first then slowly work into bigger bank roll with confidence and strategies risk.",

But if I had 20k on hands, I would probably invest some of it in stocks, not everything, but 5k on something stable like Microsoft could be an option to think of. If you are in thech company already - invest in your skills. Idk what are you doing there, but having skills and experience is great in any case. Travel and networking - if you want to start something by yourself - communication is everything. I think you need to tell more about what you are on to suggest some other investment solutions.   \nPS: don't do crypto",

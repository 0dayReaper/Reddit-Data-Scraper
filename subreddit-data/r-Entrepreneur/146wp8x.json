    "postText": "My boyfriend and I both work at two different apartment complexes (maintenance and manager) and we often have people asking us for move out clean recommendations. With a baby on the way and needing some flexible extra income, we\u2019re considering making it a small business of ours! We have access to see who\u2019s moving out and plan to reach out a month before each move out, make flyers and have custom shirts. The only problem is we\u2019re both only available after 5pm, but with full weekend availability. To make up for the limited availability, we plan to offer significantly lower rates than most.. $75 for a one bedroom and $90 for a two bedroom. Is this doable? Any tips? We\u2019re hoping to get 3-4 cleans per week between the two properties (approximately 900 units total with about 25 move outs a month).",

            "comment": "Sounds low to me, but try with a couple of apartments first, then adjust prices. Decide the price like this: what hourly rate you want, how many hours you use, how many people you are  (2 people x 3 hrs x $20/hr = 120$) plus expences.\n\nLike, you probably dont need one full bottle of cleaning product per apartment, but you should still take some into account, plus fuel, plus some overhead/profit for the business that you save for rainy days, insurance, mishaps etc, probably at least 20%, so if we say 120$ + 20 for expenses, thats 140, plus 20% for profit, thats $140 + $28 = $168\n\nAfter a while you might even be able to adjust the price based on the ft^2 of the apartment :)\n\nThese are of course just example numbers",

            "comment": "Cleaning businesses must balance pricing and profitability. Here's a strategy that targets both high-paying clients and stable customers:\n\n  \nTarget higher-paying clients: Market to quality-conscious customers who are willing to pay more for excellent cleaning. These clients may have standards that match your experience. To justify higher prices, offer customized packages, specialized cleaning, or other value-adds.\n\n  \nRegular clients should receive discounted pricing or packages. This builds consumer loyalty and guarantees work. Prioritize client pleasure and offer incentives for repeat business.\n\n  \nSchedule additional cleanings on weekends as you and your partner have limited weekday availability. This lets you serve clients who are available on weekends or have move-outs. Effective scheduling and time management maximize revenues while accommodating availability.\n\n  \nPrioritize excellent service: Regardless of pricing, give all clients top-notch service. Always surpass expectations, pay attention to detail, and give a comprehensive and trustworthy cleaning service. Outstanding service will help you acquire and keep high-paying and regular clients.\n\n  \nReferrals and reviews: Ask happy customers to recommend you and post feedback. Online and word-of-mouth reviews can boost your business. Referral discounts and loyalty schemes can encourage customers to recommend your great service.\n\n  \nYou can balance and profit by attracting higher-paying clients, offering competitive pricing, and giving excellent service. Based on client input, market demand, and industry changes, adjust your plan.",

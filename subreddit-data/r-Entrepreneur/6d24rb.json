But you need to focus on your conversion rate which must be zero considering the following.\n\n\nYour Services should be your homepage, not the picture.\n\n\n\nOn mobile, that menu shouldn't turn into a dropdown. It's small and must be used if the user wants information.\n\nYour Services should include all the various things you can hire a car for. It's like your About and Services content got switched.\n\n\nDoes your competition have prices advertised?\n\n\nNothing tells me this service is still active and it's 2017 so change the footer.\n\n\nThe font is nice and elegant but hard to read.\n\n\nRemove \"and providing personalised services.\". It's implied and the three things before it sound fine.\n\n\n\nI don't want to fill out that much information about the journey without even knowing the price or if it will be available. \n\n\n\nMake the contact form more concise and offer either offer dropdowns of major districts for pick-up and destination or let them write the addresses in a text block. \n\n\n\n\n\nZip / Postal Code... Crazy thing to have in a contact form. They're not verifying a card or organizing automated shipping from Amazon.\n\n\n\n&gt;In **March**, Adelaide comes alive through the Adelaide Fringe Festival and WOMADelaide which feature both local and international artists. The Santos Tour Down Under cycling event and the Clipsal 500 car race also encourages people to get involved with the sporting atmosphere. \n\n\nIt's May. Make it relevant and make me want to tour your city.\n\n\n&gt;For those who love food and wine, Adelaide caters to you with the many diverse cafes and restaurants, while the Barossa and Clare Valley allow you to experience some of the most beautiful wine regions in the world. Our drivers would love to be your guides whether you would like to explore Adelaide or visit Hahndorf for a taste of German culture!\n\n&gt;Book a winery tour in the most popular wine regions: Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale or Adelaide Hills. \n\nEntice me.. Include more details and pictures of what I can see and what I will be sitting in.\n\n\nInstead of only offering pickup and destination, put together itineraries with a free pickup.\n\n\n\nTry to change the wording for Google searches like  \"private car barossa\" etc.",

Questions:\n\n&gt;Build landing pages for those specific events/type of photographer.\n\n&gt;Use those landing pages to target and promote to those specific photographers in your immediate area.\n\nWhere would you promote them? Sorry, this may be obvious, but it's always alluded me. I'm great at thinking of ideas and building things, but actually promoting and getting people to use said things seems like brain surgery to me. Or are you just talking about promoting them with Facebook Ads targeting my immediate area?\n\n&gt;Use the 100 people you signed up and build a Facebook lookalike audience.\n\nI've read the link you gave and I'm still not quite sure what this is or how to set it up? I always thought this was created based on a pixel from your website but the link you gave says: \"you choose a source audience (a Custom Audience **not** created with a data partner, your pixel data...\" Is there a \"like I'm 5\" version of how to build a lookalike audience?\n\nRegarding the landing pages, would those be more informational type pages which link to the main signup page over at famsnap.com or would the signup form be right in the landing page itself?\n\nThanks again",

I'm generally outgoing, friendly, and of good cheer. But deep inside, I know I'm meant for more than this. I work a FT job as a software technician, and have wanted to be an entrepreneur for about 14 years. However, a series of poor decisions, such as losing a 10 year marriage and a career, has resulted in me going nowhere in life, struggling paycheck to paycheck. I've never been the type of guy who's said, \"I know what I want to do with my life.\" Meaning, I know I want to be an entrepreneur, but I don't know what I want to do. I've been soul searching for a few months, getting very serious about picking something that aligns to my knowledge and interests. I'm waiting for the \"I could do that for the rest of my life\" idea. My question for you is how did you overcome your own mind, take actionable steps, and begin to see your life form in a satisfying way?",

You're depressed because you're mindset is wrong. Once you stop thinking 'I'm going nowhere' and start enjoying the small things in life like the things you do to try and become and entrepreneur, or a walk in the park, seeing your friends, reading, listening to your favourite album... once you stop and realise life is short and it's one big journey with no end goal that will magically make you happy... you will be happy. You probably never live in the moment. Do you constantly think of the future? Of what you will become? Or the past? Of your failures? Try to do that less and less, and focus on the things that make you feel happy in the moment. ",

Serve the local biz around you that are appealing to college students. I did this and was a great learning experience. HFG Consulting. This basically helped me get my job at Facebook. I got other students to do marketing for local biz, then created student discount card (Ninja Card) then created College Up (craigslist for students) and that experience made it easier to get my job.\n\nThe most important thing is:\n\n* Persist - Things take time so don't give up after a month. Impressive things take years.\n* Evolve - Facebook started with Wirehog and had students schedules. Now they are doing VR among other things. Recognize where the world is heading and help create the future.\n\nFor working out I don't take supplements. Here's my high-level tips on health*:\n\n* Have a goal\n* Get a partner or accountability buddy\n* Track what you eat, here's mine: http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/okdork\n* Find sustainable, 99% of all diets / workouts are not sustainable\n* Make it fun for yourself, I like biking so I do more of that. My workouts got boring so I mix them up.\n* Be consistent. I go the gym 3 times a week. Took 2 years or so to see real gains.\n\n~ I am a doctor and trust everything I say with health**\n\n** I'm not and trying things out for yourself :)",

You can spend an entire week figuring out how you want to run your accounting. A month figuring out how you want to incorporate. Hours spent figuring out if you should use Word Press or not.\n\nJust get launched, and figure that stuff out as you go. Why? Because every moment you're not launched is wasted time.\n",

But no idea has convinced me enough to drop my full time job, and I also hold some equity so the decision becomes even harder.\n\nWhat words of wisdom do you have for me in terms of finding my true passion and idea? I know I could do well with 100s of ideas, but I am too ambitious to not go for something I am sure will be a massive hit, which is a paradox in itself.",

Not one focuses on the players. \n\nWhat I'm doing: I'm focusing on the competitive players. I created a rank system for the game \n[champrank!](https://champtrade.com/games/yugioh/rank/champrank) which offers players a way to see how they have done in the history of the game. My idea can hopefully scale to other games.\n\nThe marketplace: A lof of website offer marketplace features but most of them don't understand what people are selling. I'm trying to give players better tools to sell their product by organizing it [marketplace!](https://champtrade.com/games/yugioh/community#/marketplace) \nFeatures include fetch data of the top cards [yugioh price!](https://champtrade.com/games/yugioh/community#yugiohprices)\n\nI'm keeping track of all the events and displaying who won at what bracket they got. Players love this [events!](https://champtrade.com/games/yugioh/community#Event/recent)\n\nI have many more features to built but they still focus on the players. \n\nmy question is just what do you think about a website like this?\n\n",

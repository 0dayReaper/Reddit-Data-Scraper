The outcome of that evaluation will determine acceptance or rejection.\n\nBe advised, almost every government agency runs on geologic time. There are no snap judgements and instant acceptances ... there's just another department to submit to, pending a committee to make the decision there should be a study.\n\nMy best guess is either department has a website and that might clue you in on how the decision process is supposed to work.",

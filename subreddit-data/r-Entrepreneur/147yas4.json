It's very tailored towards tourists so I don't think locals would find it interesting.\n\nTours are largely booked based on previous reviews, so before I have this how I can get the ball rolling?

Bonus points: invite your friends / acquaintances, and ask for a review after.\n\n\\- Make a simple website. Optimize your homepage for the keyword \"walking tour \\[location\\]\"\n\n\\- Make a Google Ads account. Advertise your homepage for the keyword \"walking tour \\[city\\]\"\n\n\\- List your services on all touristy websites. Tripadvisor, GetYourGuide, Airbnb Experiences, and a couple more, I forget which ones. \n\n\\- Make a Google My Business account to show up on Google Maps when people look for walking tours.\n\n\\- Offer a free walking tour. That's the \"meta game.\" Basically offer a free general tour, and at the end of that tour, upsell other paid tours. That's what most tour companies do in major cities around the globe. Plus, those free tours make pretty good money in tips. Ballpark, most people tip around 10 EUR per person for the free walking tour.\n\n\\- Create an Instagram page and make it look interesting. Tourists usually check those.\n\n\\- Leave flyers in local hotels/hostels",

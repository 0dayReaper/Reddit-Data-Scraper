And better pictures is absolutely helpful, good information. \n\nJust not a Dick pic. No need to see your bank statement aka dick pic. But show us your profile pictures aka more than just revenue.

            "comment": "Interestingly why margin/profits ... etc is important is something I've talked about before on here which people here don't seem to understand: risk.\n\nIf you have high price items and low margin then you are often overexposing yourself to that risk.\n\nTake a concrete example. A lot of these FBA courses say to pick a high value item as even with a small margin few sales will mean a decent profit. That's true but it also increases your risk significantly. So say I'm selling via FBA, I'm selling Jetski's at $50k and my margin is 5%. That's means I'll get $2.5k per jetski I sell so I only need to sell like 2 jetski's per month to be able to live off right ?\n\nWhat's not figured in the above calc is my risk. Everytime I sell a jetski I'm at $50k's worth of risk. So my per month risk if I sell 2 is $100k and I only actually make $60k in the entire year. So if a single buyer fucks me over somehow for example smashing up the jetski and blaming it on me, delivery scam ... etc. Who's on the line to pay the $50k? That's right it's me and at that margin I'd have to sell 10 months worth of Jetski's just to be back in the black if anything goes wrong with a single sale. It's clear in this example that my risk is way too high.\n\nIf I sold a product at $10 and I have 5% margin in terms of risk I'd have to make sure that shrinkage on sales was less than the 5% margin per month but I could work that out way more easily by selling 10000 product at $10 then I could selling 2 products at $50k each a single screw up in the former wouldn't bankrupt me but the later may well.\n\nIn general also though if I have to have a high number of items I'm also exposing myself to risk in this example If I keep stock of 3-4 jetskis i'd be able to eventually sell them but if I have 10000 items that suddenly don't sell I'm screwed (think fidget spinners). There is a balance to risk but to understand someone's exposure they have to include their margin otherwise we'd be totally guessing if what they are bragging about is going to come crashing down very soon.",

Obviously if you just buy something and sell it for less than you bought it for, that is probably a poor business plan. But if you created a product or service and operated at a loss for your first year, but have a proven product and are growing your user base, that could be a good thing. Many impressive companies are not profitable at the outset, sometimes losing billions (see Tesla, Uber, Spotify, etc.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

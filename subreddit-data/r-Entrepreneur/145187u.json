    "postText": "So after sending out an email, the supplier contacted me the next day to ask for my confirmation of purchase. In the reply email, I confirmed and also asked them to advise us on the order and payment process.\n\nNow its been 3 days since I've sent out that email, and I haven't gotten a response. Should I write a completely new email to the supplier, or reply them using the first email that they sent me?\n\nEdit: Also, is 3 days too soon for a follow up email? How many business days should I typically wait?",

            "comment": "\nAS PER MY LAST EMAIL(make sure it's all caps)\n\nJokes aside, without knowing further details I would expect their response the following day or the day after. Or if they aren't sure yet at least some kind of info when they will know.  Three days without answer is definitely slipping into the unprofessional zone unless they are dealing with actual calamities (wildfires?). Imagine you have an issue with the product and need them to address it asap. Would you be comfortable waiting a week for a response?\n\nAt that point I would likely give them a call and say \"I just wanted to follow up since I haven't heard back from you...\" or \" hi,  I just wanted to kindly remind you that I'm still waiting on the requested info since i would like to move ahead with (my project or whatever) \".\nThis can also be an email but to convey urgency a call would be better.  Don't let them get used to let you wait.",

So we haven't reached the point of selling them to the public yet, but yes, I still get your drift. \n\nI'll definitely drop them a follow up email today. Thanks!",

That said, if the company has a listed phone number, call it!! We are constantly astonished at the number of people who would rather repeatedly send emails into the void than use the phone for its original purpose and solve the problem in ten seconds flat. Talk to someone. With your voice. The connection is immediate, no waiting. If you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve reached the right dept. say \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve reached the right dept. but \u2026\u201d You\u2019ll get transferred to the right dept. 9/10 I end up telling a frustrated customer there\u2019s a typo in the email address they were trying to use. If it didn\u2019t bounce it went somewhere, just not to us.",

Look up the CEO of the company and tag them in the email thread, then immediately call them on their cell.\n\nOnly do below if you\u2019re alright burning the relationship:\n\nIf they drag their feet, call their board if they have one.\n\nIf not enough, cc the CEO of their competitor in the thread.\n\nYou gave them your money and you\u2019re just looking for an answer, but tell them you\u2019ll be seeking more if you need to keep chasing things down.",

    "postText": "hey y\u2019all, \n\nI hope some of you can give me some advice or as the title states, \u201cwhat would you do?\u201d \n\nsome context: Two years out of college making 70k a year. Might not be crazy good money, but for a first gen student; life changing money. That salary in itself, was more than my parents ever made combined. So life, is already better than it was before. After having spent two years post grad in the workforce, I\u2019ve come to find out how much I hate the 9-5 grind only to get 2 days off and repeat the cycle. I just cant envision my life like that anymore. Sure, I\u2019m young, but still like lol. \n\nBusiness context: \n\nMy older sister has a boss who is a *really* great guy. Like, came from nothing and tightened his boot straps. He created this huge Vet clinic in the state and dude is raking in money. \nNow the business side of things. He owns a few businesses around town and they all do pretty well. There was one specific business he closed down. \n\nHe use to own a shaved ice truck. Completely remodeled a truck and customized it to have everything you could need to run a shop inside the truck. We recently were painting his house, and I noticed that the truck has been there since 2019. I asked him about the business and why it shut down. He told me that it was making great money, but it wasn\u2019t enough for him compared to his other businesses. He also shared that none of his kids wanted to run the business (they\u2019re rich so there\u2019s no need to I guess lol) \nThe business, specifically, has an amazing reputation around town. He closed shop in 2019 but I still hear the occasional person mention the truck. \n\nI asked him if he would ever sell the business as is? Name, logo, all materials + already built reputation. \n\nHe gave me a price of $20k. The guy is a great dude, I could probably bring it down a bit more. \n\nThe location: It is very seasonal, when it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s hot. When it\u2019s cold, oh it\u2019s cold. We were thinking of turning it into a pastry place during the winter.  \n\nWe are a Latino family, and we have thought of incorporating flavors and syrups imported from Mexico to separate us from the competition.\n\n*Now the question: What would you do?* \n\nSome info on me, mid 20s with a 70k yearly income. Have $30k saved up between my mom and I. \nI\u2019m a marketing &amp; PR major. I specialize in social media, SEO, marketing material, etc. i don\u2019t plan on quitting my day job, but merely running this truck on the weekends or afternoons\n\nThank you!!! I\u2019ll gladly answer any questions",

But if you find it to be profitable you can then decide to buy it. \n\nEx. You give him 10% of profits. After all expenses (buying food, napkins, gas, etc.) you end up with $1,000. He gets $100 and you get the other $900. If you make no money you just give him his truck back with a full tank of gas and eat whatever losses you have (I assume that would be less than the $20k you\u2019d pay to get the truck).\n\nSo you took less risk because you can potentially lose less now if this venture doesn\u2019t work. But your boss could potentially make that $20k off of you plus whatever else he makes from the profit sharing. \n\nI would offer your boss something like 30%-70% of profits, but trying to get him at or below 50% ideally. That\u2019s me personally though and you might get a better or worse deal depending on your relationship and what he really wants",

You essentially split the proceeds of the business activities along a percentage line.\n\nThis is fairly common in some types of business like real estate investing. \n\nThere it's called a partnership agreement where the \"General Partner\" is doing the sweaty work of finding the project and operating the business, while the \"Limited Partner\" provides the money, but doesn't do any of the active management.\n\nIn a realestate deal, it's pretty common for the GP to get 30% of the profit and the LP to get 70%. But they usually have a time horizon, real estate stuff can take 3-5 years to turn a profit, so the money doesn't start flowing back to investors until the whole thing has broke even.\n\nIf you google it, there should be plenty of business plans for a food truck available online, then also look up revenue share for food truck, and see what looks standard in your area.\n\nIf you are in the US, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has a LOT of resources for free, since taxes already paid for it. The do have a program called SCORE, that will pair you up with a free business mentor that is a retired executive from the requested industry.",

Considering you're thinking of running the truck on the weekends, it doesn't seem like you want out of the 9-5 because you want more time to yourself. Totally valid either way.\n\nIt's never a bad thing to hustle for multiple sources of income if that's how you want to spend your time. As others are saying, I would explore your options more before committing to putting down 20k.\n\nFor example, if free time is actually what you want, then investing that 20k somewhere else like the market or real estate could yield more *passive* income. \n\nOn somewhat of a side note, though, I think it's pretty common to feel that way at first when you're a new grad. I graduated 4 years ago so I remember it pretty clearly -- like, this is going to be the rest of my life now?\n\nI value stability so I can invest time in hobbies during my free time. And what I've learned is that if you climb the corporate ladder, not everyone works the same 9-5 you do. I definitely see higher management at my company get paid more yet clock less hours. When things catch on fire it's on their head, but eventually you don't always have to grind as much.",

Sure, I can bite my tongue and do the 9-5 grind for a few years to really \u201clearn\u201d how to work as some would say. But for what? I think I\u2019d feel the same way. I\u2019d still want to be my own boss. It\u2019s mainly working for someone else that neither my family or I want anymore. \n\nI hear you out on the time part. I have definitely taken other peoples advice on here and will look into a rent to own or profit sharing so I don\u2019t have to invest upfront $20k. And potentially invest a portion of what would\u2019ve been the upfront cost, into somewhere else that can generate passive income. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where I\u2019m kind of at. I\u2019ve gotten a taste of great, and horrible management. Promotions &amp; raises. Praises &amp; critiques. And generally, it\u2019s been very positive since graduating. *Yet*, I still want to leave it to be able to manage my own. \n\nI totally hear you on that part. I find myself in a management position, not super high, but enough to where I don\u2019t *really* need to work 40 hours. And having S-S off, 25 days PTO, 2 weeks sick pay; there\u2019s plenty of place to be comfortable for a while. I guess I just don\u2019t like the routine of it. \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come off as condescending or anything.

    "postText": "Hello entrepreneurs, I have been trying to raise funds to take my small business offline and open a physical shop. Does anyone here know how I can do that and where too. \nI do all my operations online, food delivery orders and all, and wish to have a small commercial kitchen that customers can even visit. I am trying to raise funds for setting up. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I am looking for means and ways to crowdfund for $2340, not raise VC . If I get even three quarters of that amount, I'd definitely set up the PoS back up again. The other quarter is for running operations.",

    "postText": "This is side hustle money, but **requires an initial investment between 5k-10k**. I'll break down some expenses at the bottom.\n\nWho is right for this: Someone that has decent customer service skills and likes interacting with the general public.\n\nIf you're like me and live in a town where there isn't a ton of fun stuff to do for young people, laser tag might be a great opportunity. If you're also like me you probably have memories of playing in a dark dirty laser tag arena being rushed around with older kids and malfunctioning equipment. But if that's what you think of laser tag be a little more open minded.\n\nThis is about providing mobile laser tag equipment for parties. What I like about this hustle is that you can maintain your costs low. You're not going to rent out space from a mall. You're not going to need employees. \n\nAcquiring customers for me is completely through social media ads and Google ads. When I first started planning this out I felt really motivated because I didn't see any competitors nearby. I was actually wrong about that. I later found out that there are two local competitors and an additional one that overlaps my area. \n\nWhat the competitors are doing wrong: Bad marketing &amp; Bad equipment\n\n- When I said I thought I didn't have any competition I mean that. Of my 3 competitors two of them have websites (neither are mobile optimized) to make matters worse they have some of the worst photos I've seen. You have to really try to make laser tag look boring and they have managed to pull it off. The third competitor doesn't even have social media but he does have a GMB listing and some of his clients have posted photos and reviews. I've noticed the parties hes working seem to be younger kids, so I suspect he has a connection with a child care facility.\n\nFor me putting together a proper WordPress website was quick and easy. What did take more effort (and a bit of cash) was photos and videos. I found a photographer that was willing to work with me relatively cheap. The subjects of the photos/video were my young cousins- compensated with lunch at chick-fil-a.\n\nThis not only provided website content for me, but I also use these exciting action images of kids playing laser tag in my social media ads. I think this is really crucial. I feel like it gets overlooked when people on this subreddit talk about ads. There is a lot of discussion on the technical aspects but the actual ad itself has to convey whatever you're selling and I think we succeed at selling \"fun\". When it comes to keyword targeting you probably don't want to assume people are looking for laser tag parties (they're not). You want to be found when they search for things such as \"birthday party entertainment\". When it comes to advertising on Facebook you have to know how to target parents (moms).\nTikTok is something we haven't tried yet but will likely be doing very soon. Primarily I'm interested in marketing directly to the kids and getting them to ask their parents to book a party for them. Also something I'm preparing to do is EDDM, I'm going to target wealthy neighborhoods with a compelling offer.\n\n- The second thing my competitors are doing wrong (and what's going to cost you the most money) is getting good laser tag equipment. There are tons of options out there and i'm not going to shill for any company. But I would recommend you stay away from what you might find on Amazon. I can't emphasize enough you don't want to go cheap here. You want gear that will be durable and connected (yes the internet of things has reached laser tag). Bluetooth and wifi are features that some of this equipment has. I recommend it. You also want some type of easy to carry barriers for more gameplay options (this you can go cheap on).\n\nThe money: Depending on where you are will impact prices. You want to aim for between $250-$300. Sessions should be 90-120 minutes. If you want to get some clients during weekdays you're going to have to offer lower rates on those days.\n\n**Costs**: After acquiring equipment your costs will be advertising, transportation, and insurance. There's a lot of possibilities here depending on where you advertise, what you drive, and what kind of policy you get. **For me** this is **roughly $600/month**.\n\nEDIT: Have been considering starting a \"league\" with tournaments. Just curious if thats something you guys would have been into when you were younger?\n\nEDIT 2: Okay a couple of you have convinced me to look into franchising. I am going to have to research corporate owned franchises.",

I just realized I didn't even mention how to actually deal with clients, booking parties, invoices, managing kids, games to play with them, offering laser tag alternatives (nerf). I also wanted to mention I think there is some potential for providing packages to businesses (team building fun). Also where to do these parties if your clients don't have yard space is pretty important.\n\nIf anyone is genuinely interested in learning this further I can help- to an extent. Just don't be jerks\n\nEdit: should have mentioned you want to book kids that are 4th grade and up.",

The kind of kids that want my laser tag services don't seem the type to want the other \"fluff\"\n\nLike any business the idea is to upsell additional options for something like bow and arrow tag, or  darts but with bow and arrow, mobile escape rooms, dodge ball, electric go kart, right? Larger birthday packages. The more you outsource to say the local bodega for food, and local mom and pop pizza store the more places that will put up a small sign of your business. So even though those things make a miniscule or moderate profit, they bring in a lot more customers from the promotion.\n\n&gt;Now when it comes to things like food or cakes there is probably some room to partner with someone on those things. But the reality is those things have much tighter margins and any extra income I could get from it is probably not worth it\n\n It seems like the idea is to outsource to a mom and pop pizza store and bodega that serves food, and also have them promote you and they get a small amount for the sale, and more for the food . And try to get your business card into many locals stores, and with birthday magicians and bounce castle renters. Then get a bunch of pictures taken at the kids party, and they will post it on their social media. That will get awareness to other kids. \n\nMy thinking is that getting exposure from popular stores(bodega, local pizza store), and magicians, kiosks that promote, is  one way to get in person marketing. The other thing would be to sell as add ons cheap $3 printed t shirts, stickers, and trinkets with your logo, and take a bunch of photos for you (with permission of the store owners) to put in the bodega or restaurant, or for kids to share on their social media. With all of these things you would contribute strongly to the promotional efforts to get your business known. \n\nAt least that is my thinking to just brainstorm as a thought exercise, you know?",

If they each get 7000 customers a year, you can convert 50 of them directly and another 50 indirectly per year. I guess the idea that even if you let the mom and pop restaurant make all the money, or most of the money on catering, you will get more exposure/customers and make it with your packages, and selling things on the side, and the cake. It is a win/win which is what everyone wants. \n\nI think that for the most part mom and pop restaurants are customer service first, and serving loyal customers and the community. If their google store rating is good then it is probably good(yelp isnt reliable anymore). I believe it is just getting as much exposure even if it means 50-100 different restaurants to collaborate with you. (pizza store, chinese restaurant,  mom and pop convenience store, after school private preschool/tuition, kids sports training facilities, kids summer camp, churches).\n\nIdk. Just a brainstorm exercise on my part.  I think you hit the nail on the head by having this service in boring mid size towns. The next thing would be imo to specialize on pure fun, and then get more packages to make an experience kids will talk about in school. Outsource and partner with entertainers and local stores. Then do the same for adult parties(normal ones mind you)/special occasion. Finally make it a franchise and get an online platform where you let professional entertainers advertise on you site,  bounce castle renters and these type of activities are also outsourced and sold on your site and you provide the inhouse activities like lazer tag, and so on.",

He has a great Facebook following and we get a lot of traffic to the website through sm and direct referrals. Average about 100 hits per day.\n\nOn GMB however, he's doing almost double that a day and we see related search terms is nearly 70% of all traffic. Plus, photo engagement is over 2k per image.",

Never started the biz myself but my friend in Seattle started doing it in on my recco and pulls down $600 or so each Thursday-Sunday.\n\nNow that I think about it we also did archery dodgeball a few times which probably has similar startup costs and all you need is a field.",

I\u2019ve thought about this type of business in the past but now I\u2019m at a point in life I\u2019m not willing to do it. Just my preference as I retreat from interacting with large and small humans and plot how to be a hermit. \ud83d\udc0c\n\nBut Seriously, I always try to avoid marketing directly to youths to reduce liability. But you could run geotargeted Google Ads and remarketing campaigns that slip ads into APPS, not just websites. Normally it\u2019s a struggle to prevent those impressions in Google Ads. But in your case it could be easier. They see the ads enough to get excited and pester parents to go.\n\nJust a thought. Good luck!",

I played paintball a lot as a teen (after playing laser tag as a kid) in an area with a lot of competing businesses (paintball arenas). All the good arenas offered their own variation on small team games. Capture the flag, defend the fort, 1 vs all, VIP, etc. Some even hosted overnight games or large group days. These variations were USPs that brought people back and created brand loyalty.\n\nEdit: not related, but now that I'm taking a trip down memory lane I gotta mention one of the arenas was called \"Magic Carpet Bob's Paintball Jungle.\" Magic Carpet Bob ran a diverse business in his little jungle hosting cock fights and growing weed as well.",

We really didn't need to spend so much right out of the gate.\n\nThe laser guns we purchased are around $700 each. Realistically we could have started out with 6 of them instead of 10, which is much easier to swallow as a startup cost. Getting started was pretty easy. Setting up a website/booking system was done in like 3 days. The only part I felt a little uncertain about was having a photographer get some quality pictures/videos of someone using our equipment for ads. It ended up being much easier than I had expected. After that I followed some guides for creating ads on Facebook/Google and we started booking parties about 2 weeks later.",

Collab with some nearby businesses to make it a bigger event (food from popular restaurant in town, maybe custom shirts or something from a print shop), hype it up with marketing, get your regulars excited and bringing their friends, and follow through with a fun event that feels high stakes but not overly competitive. If you\u2019re talking something bigger, like a national tournament or something, probably wouldn\u2019t be very profitable, most people who get serious about this type of stuff play paintball because it\u2019s more competitive and realistic. I\u2019m sure if you are creative and good at marketing you could gain a following and make it successful (a good business is 10% idea and 90% execution), but I don\u2019t see it really blowing up.",

Simple 5v5, I did play an outdoor version of laser tag though which had more appeal to me than indoor, more adrenaline, was a step away from paintball without the pain / exorbitant costs associated with that. They ran both parties and public sessions as well, so they really opened it up to large groups when it was doing really well for them, I would go and there'd be upwards of 30 people in a 2-3 hour game session which was really good fun.\n\n\nLink to what I played [here](https://laserstrike.com.au/) they did big events and stuff every now and then as well. I was just young with no disposable income so couldn't keep it up without my parents being willing to give me money for it unfortunately. \n\nIn response to edit 2, definitely look into franchising, you have the potential of renting out the gear to the franchisee's if you can reach the economies of scale for maintaining the guns and purchasing them and such.",

Exchange rate, I'm in Australia, so do that conversion from Aud to usd, and the cost per person will be a bit lower. \n\nFor public sessions and like parties, they have camo jumpsuits you wear, the idea being to protect your regular clothes underneath, and let you get a bit muddy and stuff.\n\nAnd of course Location, whether you're renting or have access to public land or what have you\n\nDue to this version being outside maybe the guns have a different cost associated? Not an expert in that regard. \n\nFinally cost to run, when you're providing referee's and such to keep track of scores that adds to the cost of the sessions and Australia's minimum wage is a lot higher than the US one, casual workers (all the ref's would be casual) have casual loading and other things on top. \n\nSo in the US you might be paying someone 10$ an hour, but in Aus they're probably getting 25$ or more per hour to run it if you're not running it yourself / depending how you run it you might need a second person.\n\n\nBut yeah, I think like your post outlined, and drew attention to there is good potential in a business like this.",

I've done a bit of both paint ball and laser tag (at different times not simultaneously lel) and preferred laser tag simply because a laser doesn't fly off in any random direction after the first few yards/meters. both are still fun though.\n\nOne of my favourite laser tags things was in a big field with a few small hills/trees/bushes and trench like areas. though importantly it was outdoors and that's what I liked.\n\neasily the worst thing about laser tag is if you keep dying you eventually can't play any more for the rest of the game.\n\nregardin tornaments i suppose you want to avoid people being over competitive or people who don't like losing and let it worsen their experience of the day. But if people can continue playing regardless of how well they perform in the tornament then I can't imagine it's that bad either way.",

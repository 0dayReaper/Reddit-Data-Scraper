Such claims can mislead others and create unrealistic expectations. It's essential to be transparent about earnings and to focus on the long-term growth and sustainability of the niche site rather than just the revenue generated. As the author of the post stated, revenue is not the same as profit, and it's crucial to consider expenses and other factors that can affect the overall success of a niche site. It's important to be cautious and do proper research before trusting or paying attention to individuals who make such claims.",

Nowadays you can do a lot with drag-and-drop website builders. You might not even need to build a custom website depending on your needs. I\u2019m sure a lot of the website builders have free trials where you can check them out in depth. Building a website from scratch should only be done if necessary.\n\nThe only thing I would say is to buy a domain name. Never use the domain name given to you for free if you\u2019re trying to host the site in a professional capacity. I find a simple $10/year domain name  gains peoples trust and is worth every penny. You can use the free name when you\u2019re developing the site but always buy a domain name when you want to make it public.",

And if you did it right, you're running ancillary offers (related offers) against the same traffic + CPM (arb) so can offset any spend. \n\nProfit would depend on your traffic source(s), but plenty of people do far more than that, and since you said \"sites\", if you assume a network of 5+ sites, that's even easier if you've spent a couple years building out content and links, built a solid list and have a social media following. \n\nI've run multiple years of affiliate income at $100k+/mo, and while those days are long gone for me, it was literally possible to do this quite easily from 2001 - 2012; traffic was free/cheap and scaled. Plus most of the affiliate programs that existed had yet to hit mainstream fraud and scammers, so they also paid out well. \n\nAs an example. Auto insurance at one point in the mid-to-late 2000's paid me over $35/lead. You'd be lucky to get half that now, and it only got worse all around as fortune 500 companies drove CPC's and CPM's up. \n\nI get it was a joke, but there's a lot of real money out there IF you have or can get the traffic.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm got the entrepreneur bug a couple years ago (finally) and I've been thinking about the power of collaboration and how it can benefit both parties involved. It's amazing how two different companies can come together and create something greater than the sum of their parts or pass work back and forth.\r  \n\r  \nI'm curious to hear about your experiences with collaborations in the business world.   \n\n\nHave any of you ever partnered with another company to expand your services or reach new customers?   \n\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced, and what benefits did you gain from such a partnership?\r  \n\r  \nI'm particularly interested in hearing about collaborations in areas like design, web designers, dev,  branding, SEO, IT, and the entire digital services umbrella.   \n\n\nFeel free to share your stories or insights. I believe there's so much we can learn from each other's experiences and I will be hanging out to take notes. Thanks!",

Maybe this is a form of collaboration. I know that if I host a company's website for free, and let them benefit from some of my marketing machinery, they're likely to be successful, and eventually turn into a good paying customer - or bring their friends.\n\nIs this collaboration? I justify it myself in a pay-it-forwards way.",

Like \"hey I got a company who needs web hosting, throws it at you\" kinda thing. Not, I'll give the customer free web hosting, so we \"collab'd\" lol. But, giving away freebies to gain more business, that's just smart business.",

            "comment": "Collaboration and relationship building are super important for most businesses to be successful. As long as it\u2019s a win-win for both parties it\u2019s great. Especially if the cost is just sweat equity.\n\nWe unsuccessfully attempted to collaborate by offering our EV charging services in partnership with a solar installer in our region. In principle it was good, but they had fears about us going into competition with them in the future and wanted us to sign a lengthy non-compete with monetary penalties for breaking. At the end of the day, we couldn\u2019t justify signing. I understand completely where they are coming from though\u2026 \n\nA successful example would be applying for joint grant funding for green energy projects. We\u2019ve identified some great organizations and asked to partner with them on a proposal. It works because we\u2019re not business competitors, and they don\u2019t have to do much besides agree to a heavily subsidized project if the funding is approved.\n\nIt\u2019s all about being creative! Anything can be negotiated or proposed.",

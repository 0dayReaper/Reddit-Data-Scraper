    "postText": "They say sales are important. So it means I have to be good a talking to people, networking, cold calling.. but I am an introvert and a shy person. And yes, I noticed that most entrepreneurs are good at social and people skills. \n\nSo I\u2019m just wondering if it is possible to have a successful business even though you are not very skilled in talking to people.",

You 100% can, and you might actually become really *really* good at it. \n\nYou have got to keep that growth mindset! you are not bad at sales you just haven't practiced yet.\n\nEdit:\nI started doing sales because I was a huge nerd in college. I recognized I was weak socially so I stepped up to the challenge. \n\nTwo short years later I was managing a sales team of 10, 2 more years and I'm running my own business.",

Obviously you\u2019ll have to practice and put yourself in uncomfortable situations a lot, but as you do it a couple times you won\u2019t be scared of it and at that point it\u2019s just about practicing and improving more. Definitely an important skill to learn, even if you want to just get a cofounder or employee to do most of the sales calls and talking.",

I hear a ton of event planners are introverted. \n\nI am also an introverted (event planner) who gets anxious when forced to talk to people. at the beginning stages I didn\u2019t want to call or meet face to face with my clients at all. Trust me. I was trying to avoid that type of contact at ALL costs. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve been running the biz for two years, I feel much more confident in talking with my clients and even meeting in person and simply chatting. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how much you can grow if you\u2019re willing to step out of your comfort. You\u2019ll be amazed at who you can become!",

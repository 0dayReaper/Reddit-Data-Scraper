The main goal for both is about education first, and of course sales naturally come from them because people watch and search my brand and products used. I will say I have followed u/garyvee advice on this one the entire time and use more of a jab, jab, jab, right hook approach with everything I do except tend to hold back on the right hooks a little too much and end up with twenty jabs before taking the right hook.\n\nNot really a fun part of the journey but one that a lot of entrepreneurs deal with, is divorce. I spent the last two years ending a 27 year marriage and finally signed papers this year. The main reason I bring this one up is because a lot of people would throw in the towel on their dreams and say what's the point in continuing. I initially started this side hustle to bring in extra money for our family and got pushback from my ex. She constantly told me how \"weird\" it was for \"a guy to be making candles\", it would never go anywhere, and it was a stupid idea that would never work. So, me trying to calm the storm, I always held back and slowed my own growth. I kept a balance of keeping peace at home while building the candle business in the background without disrupting that fragile balance.During that long two years I of course moved on with my business and started to attack it much harder than I had in the previous years. I also ended up meeting someone who was unbelievably supportive and really helped me grow it further.\n\nNow the fun part.Since last year I had someone reach out to me and redesign my website which was a huge help. I could not keep up with everything even if I knew how to do it all myself.  I had to give up some control and hand it over to someone else who was more talented than I was. This also have me more time to focus on actually making candles and videos. I wish I would of done this sooner.I started to ramp up the online candles classes a little and get one scheduled at least once every 2-3 months out which was a hit. I open each class with 25 seats and almost every class was full.I will also say that I did not ever hold back or take away my free content to transition it to paid classes. People can still get everything I teach in these classes for free on youtube, the group, and my website.The classes are meant to take all that information and condense it into a quick one stop place to get all that info in 3-4 hours. I think this has been important for my growth as well. For those that cannot afford the ticket price, they can watch videos and read articles at their own pace.\n\nThe youtube channel is still doing really well but took a bigger slump in the first quarter of the year than I expected. Views normally go down around this time but with the addition of more candle making channels to the space I don't think my channel is featured in the algorithm as much as it was previous. Which makes perfect sense with more competition out there now. Last year the channel made just over $32,000 and this year was on track to make around $45-$50K. With the slow down in views I knew it would drop a little from the $50,000 target. Along with that I have opened my supply business which is taking time and I have missed quite a few videos the past 2-3 months which has also hit monthly ad sense. I am still on track to make just over $32,000 again which in my mind is still beyond amazing.\n\nThe candles are still doing really well but have slowed down with everything else going on. Markets still not going so I kept everything to online sales and started the year strong with candle sales, e-book sales, and candle classes but have since slowed that a little with the opening of the candle supply website. This is another area that has slowed down since the launch of the candle supply site, but even with that slow down the candle website is still making around $4000 a month. With the holidays being the busiest season for candles I expect to end the year with around $50,000 in sales from the candle site alone.\n\nThe facebook group is still going strong and a huge help to people wanting to make candles and also a big driver in sales to not only my candles and e-books but now my candle supply company. I still keep the group a place to learn and not a place to straight sell. I still operate on the jab jab jab right hook philosophy in keeping it about helping and then the occasional post about my supplies for those interested.Not only myself but there are numerous people who benefit from the group, makers, to suppliers to designers, we try to keep the group a nice environment for all involved which is why I created the group in the first place. Some of the groups before hand had very negative culture which made it very intimidating for new candles makes trying to learn. I think this approach alone is why my group has so successful, we try to maintain the safe and helpful environment to new as well as advanced. I can't even begin to calculate how many sales are driven by the group but its around 30-40% of traffic coming from facebook in general.\n\nThe candle supply company kind of came out of nowhere fast and really just made sense. With so many people coming to me asking what wax to use and who sells it, where can I get this and that, I finally wanted to say you can get them from me. Its always been in the back of my mind but I kept the idea growing slowly until around May. I have been talking with a larger candle supply company wanting to get into the U.S. market and they wanted to go through me to break into the market. After more than a year of talking back and forth about candles and ultimately building that friendship. They ended up sending me a large shipment of wicks and I created a website and started selling the stock they sent me. The wick order they sent me was about $4000 and I quickly paid that off as I sold them. I didn't go find investors, no one helped out other than the wicks they sent and I didn't take any loans to launch this. The only reason I say this is when I read stories like this it always takes a turn for me when someone says \"and with a loan, or a gift from my Dad of $200,000 dollars I was able to make this all happen.\" Which is always a little defeating to hear. I wanted to make this relatable to people like me who don't have those opportunities coming to them. Now having said that I did have someone give me $4000 in wicks. But, it really wasn't given at no cost to me. I spent the last four years building a brand that was just as valuable to them as them sending me the wicks to get started working with each other. Once those wicks sold I took all that money, paid the invoice, ordered more wicks and took that profit to order $2000 my first eight fragrance oils. Once those eight fragrance oils sold for $4000, I took the profit from those and ordered eight more fragrance oils. I kept that going and currently have twenty six to choose from with another eight on the way. I also ordered two more types of wicks to put on the site and currently looking for more supplies to add all the time.  \nI also paid someone to develop the candle site from the start, no way I was going to try and do that myself again. I hired the couple who created my candle website. \n\nThis has not been easy at all and I am making mistakes and learning from them every day. Once the wicks sold they shipped me candle was melters and I began pre orders on those which turned out to be a mistake. The over seas suppliers were giving me an arrival date of the end of July, beginning of August so I started to take on pre preorders at the end of June. Of course customs issues started to really ramp up since talking about the melters and what was the first of August quickly turned into another two weeks, then another week, and another week, and finally received the melters the first week of October. I of course kept everyone in the loop who ordered one but having to tell people its going to be delayed week by week for over a month was not fun. I would not do pre orders again unless I had concrete dates of arrival. Lesson learned for sure.Shipping times have also killed me and something I am working my ass off to improve. I am still doing all of this by myself for the most part. I get some help from my son and friends here and there but I am putting everything together pretty much myself and trying to keep up. This is why I am trying to hire someone ASAP. I need help and can't keep up with orders which of course turns into delayed delivery times which sucks. I take full responsibility on this one, it turned out to be busier than even I expected.\n\nTo this date the supply website is about to cross $100,000 in sales here in the next week and based on previous months sales I am projecting to clear around $130-$140,000 in sales. Next year I think I can easily double those numbers. Adding up the supply site, the candle site, and yotube I know that I will clear minimum of $200,000 this year and if I can really kick it into overdrive with the last two months of the year being the busiest time for candles I think I can actually make closer to $250,000 this year.\n\nI also just opened my first brick and mortar retail and warehouse location! I am very excited about this one and I will try to attach pictures to the post. The finishing touches are being put on the retail side and the warehouse side is ready to go. I met with my first potential employee last night and really excited to get this going.I am still working my full time job which is in I.T. with the plans to transition to the candles full time within the next 1-2 years.\n\nThere are a couple more things that add to the overall numbers like affiliate links which is another $3000-$4000 a year.\n\nAll in all it's been an amazing journey and one that has ben way more than I ever thought it would be. I also have to give a huge shoutout to u/garyvee who has been the one guy I looked to for little tips and help along the way. I have to say that because someone was talking shit just a while back about how his advice is bullshit and no one actually makes money from \"his motivational bullshit\"Well I for one can honestly say his advice, videos, and books have helped me tremendously.",

Before there was electricity how did we keep light on in the house for our families as men? By making candles and keeping them lit. Think about who owns the store chain Bath and Body Works, you know, the store that's constantly filled with women? A Man founded that store. I really can't stand when a women tries to belittle and emasculate a Man for finding his footing and trying to build an honest living ESPECIALLY when he was trying to do it for her as well. What a horrible women, ABSOLUTELY her loss. Anyway, I love hearing progress like this man, keep up the hard work and dedication, you're making STRIDES! It's all a snowball effect after a while.

There's nothing more secure about working a 9 to 5 for corporate that will lay you off the second it's in their fickle interest to do so. In fact, I'd argue that \"internet business\" is a lot more stable and secure than trying to play office politics or whatever mind-games to appease a boss. Job-security might have meant something decades ago, but it's a pipe dream in this day and age.\n\nAll that is pretty much non-applicable though, since in many cases, and including mine, I was doing both. I would not recommend quitting a job to start a venture that you must rely on for survival. \n\nBut there's also plenty of proven business models to choose from, and besides, it sounds like OP's ex was more concerned about making candles not being \"macho\" or something a man would do, which is another mark of stupidity and short-sightedness as well. As if groveling to a boss for a job, and then subsequent raises that don't even keep up with inflation is somehow \"manly\".",

By not committing to your business full-time, you're holding back your business's growth.\n\nWhen I left my job to focus on my business, it was a \"next level\" type of change, and my sales grew 50%+ year-over-year.\n\nYou're on the right track and obviously have a knack for what you're doing, so leave your job ASAP.

    "postText": "1. Important people come and go, and that's okay.\n\nUnfortunately, the most important people in your life can become strangers overnight.\n\nFortunately, total strangers can become the most important people in your life overnight. This process hurts, but if accepted, it serves to improve the quality and suitability of the people in your life.\n\n2. Your diet isn't just what you eat.\n\nAs you get older you realize that your diet isn't just what you eat, it's what you watch, what you read, who you follow, and who you spend your time with.\n\nSo if your goal is to have a healthier mind, you have to start by removing all the junk from your diet.\n\n3. You have to let people down to be happy.\n\nYou and your mental health are more important than your career, more money, other people's opinions, that event you said you would attend, your partner's mood, and your family's wishes.\n\nIf taking care of yourself means letting someone down, then let someone down.\n\nYour self-love must always be stronger than your desire to be loved by others.\n\n4. Never let rejection lead to self-rejection.\n\nA person who has experienced rejection fears rejection and a person that fears rejection tends to push or run away before they can be rejected.\n\nIn their subconscious mind, they have avoided rejection.\n\nIn reality, they've been rejected again this time by themselves.\n\n5. Own your responsibilities, own your future.\n\nYou're not responsible for your trauma but you are responsible for breaking the cycle and not hurting more people because of what happened to you.\n\nYou will never control your future if you let your present be controlled by your past.\n\nWhat happened yesterday may not be your responsibility, but how you behave today is.\n\n6. Quality over quantity.\n\nLife is about quality, not quantity. \n\nOne quality friend gives you more than 100 acquaintances.\n\nOne quality relationship gives you more than 100 flings. \n\nOne quality experience gives you more than 100 drunken nights.\n\n7. Fairytales will make you unhappy.\n\nObsessing over the things that society said you're \"supposed to do\" will kill your happiness.\n\nDon't listen to the fake fairytales of how\n\nyour life is supposed to be going.\n\nYou don't have to go to university at 18, get a job at 21, buy a house at 25, get married at 30, or have kids at 35.\n\nEveryone is different, and your path to happiness will be too.\n\n8. Fun is yours.\n\nIf you want to enjoy your life, don't subscribe to other people's definition of \"fun\".\n\nThe fun doesn't have to mean drinking, partying, and socializing Fun can be a night alone, getting lost in a book, a deep conversation, a walk, creating art, playing music, or doing work that you love.\n\nYour fun belongs to you, make sure you define it.",

When I feel like I've given 200% and it's not seen or appreciated, or getting passed over for a career position because \"you're not as spirited as our group, and we hang out after work on Fridays\" -- which feels like age-discrimination...  it's hard, buy maybe a sign that something better or more fitting will come along.",

They need people, especially younger ones, to get help in various things. \n\nAlso, they want good company with their same aged friends or relatives. So, family is very important. Grandparents having their grandchildren close to them becomes a blessing as they age.\n\nRelationship with God. Sticking to good moral values and avoiding morally unethical things makes an aged person more respectable and more positive.\n\nBesides making friends, do not attempt to have enemies. A hundred friends are less than one enemy or opposer. They can be a constant pain. So avoid turning people into opponents just for the sake of your ego or for passing time.\n\nEarn good money or earn less or if luck makes you survive on jobless support money, anyways, don't let financial condition eat your brain. Money is a reality but not so real that it gives you goosebumps 24/7. Don't just become a mental patient by thinking constantly about money.\n\nLeave, yes learn to leave unnecessary arguments, debates, opposition or unnecessary habits and useless things and people. These things just eat life. Our time is limited. \n\nAvoid negative, ungrateful and complaining people. They can literally make you a failure. But you yourself empower them to do so with you by letting them to do",

Decided I\u2019d comment a little rant on what I think about this list\u2026 \n\n1 is so truthful, I\u2019ve had great times with friends who\u2019ve I\u2019ve talked to everyday and became very close with. Then out of the blue I end up never speaking to them again. I question it every so often, but maybe it was just meant to be. \n\n3 don\u2019t let people pour their problems on you, I\u2019ve had it happen many times in the past by those who don\u2019t actually understand the real struggle behind mental illness or use it as a way to get attention. It\u2019s very easy to say the wrong thing and be looked at as a \u201cbad\u201d person. \n\n7 is a big one with social media showing the ways of how everybody should think. Nobody is the same. As for how your life should go, you never have to follow the so called \u201cregular routine\u201d. I\u2019m starting college much later than pretty much everyone I knew in HS and has definitely made some substantial changes in my life, the things I look back on and the noticeable changes I\u2019ve made as a person. I didn\u2019t have that big social life to jump into, but it gave me a lot of free time to think, figure out my insecurities and work on what the changes and journey will look like to make a change to my entire lifestyle. Grade school and College are completely different, this is your career you\u2019re pursuing. Although, I still don\u2019t think college is necessarily unless it is an absolute must for what you plan to pursue. \n\n8 is a very good point, I once thought I\u2019d hate my life if I didn\u2019t have college parties to attend or going out with irl friends every weekend. The alone/free time I had is something I will never regret and it made me realize how much I will prioritize it in the future.",

Sometimes, joy is watching pro wrestling, eating a half dozen donuts, consuming trashy gossip rags, etc.\n\nIt's important that you recognize the difference between what has substance and what doesn't, and it's important not to pretend you can subsist on the latter forever. But you can still enjoy it.\n\nOne of my brother's best friends is kind of a shithead idiot, and my brother knows it- but they have *fun* together, and it creates space in his life that he doesn't get from anyone else.\n\nI'd also add something for #9: Own your mistakes. Learn to apologize sincerely (not as a way to explain or defend your behavior), and how to see why what you did was wrong from someone else's perspective even if you might not have felt the same way in their position. \n\nOnce you learn to apologize meaningfully, you can heal relationships and strengthen bonds like never before. If you never learn this critical skill, you'll hopscotch from friendship/relationship to another, always thinking you're never the problem. Own your fallibility and be humble. Stand tall, but know that you are human. Let yourself be human.",

    "postText": "Determination is one of the many lessons we can learn from Melanie Perkins and her journey of starting Canva. She pitched the idea to over 100 investors before managing to secure a meeting Bill Tai.\n\nAnd interestingly enough, she met Bill Tai at a conference that Perkins wasn\u2019t even a part of. She said \u201cI spoke to him for five minutes, and he said if I went to San Francisco he\u2019d be happy to meet with me. So I jumped on a plane to San Francisco and true to his word he met with me.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the pitch was a success. Fast forward 8 years and Melanie Perkins has a net worth of $6.5 billion\n\nWould you still be pitching to investors after 100 unsuccessful attempts?  \n\n\nEDIT: Based on the replies, I thought I'd share more information on Canva's background and the company's journey as a startup. Here are some really interesting and helpful videos:  \n\n\n\\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPdXxchdkDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPdXxchdkDY)  \n\\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TBSg79Gf0M&amp;t=256s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TBSg79Gf0M&amp;t=256s)  \n\\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep21f3ncvBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep21f3ncvBk)  \n\\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw6i93Iu\\_40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw6i93Iu_40)",

They might suspect that it is going to take over a market or something, and with some companies (maybe not Canva since I think they are public), they might have access to information you don't know. E.g. future product strategies, market information, etc. (serious investors might still have that information even with public companies just because they can dedicate serious resources to researching it).\n\nThe other thing to remember is that it doesn't necessarily matter what the valuation is now. Unless you've got your own money in it then why does it matter. It's based on that based on speculative investing. If it goes well, then those that risked their money on it get paid off, if it doesn't then they lose it all. If you don't like the money just don't invest, and if it does fail or drop in value then you've lost nothing.",

Who would want to lug around a computer in the pocket without buttons? When Steve jobs made that pitch the prevailing experience the public had with touch screens was incredibly shitty.  Lots of people wouldn't use computers because they were too complicated.  Heck even the idea of UX was in it's infancy, now an infant should be able to pick up your app and know how to maneuver through it through intuition and context clues alone.",

Now people don't choose a carrier and then a phone, they choose a phone and then a carrier! Back then phones were devices sold by carriers, changing that, essentially means losing control of the customer. It happened anyway, but their fear (that they will be overshadowed) was right!",

If you have a demo (e.g. a working product) then start selling it to customers, and then soon enough you'll have those numbers. Outside of accelerators which take a big % of the company for honestly not that much money, people are going to want to see that people actually want your product *before* they invest in it, unless its super compelling and you've got an amazing team that convinces them you've got some sort of special advantage.",

It's not hard to keep going when all the \"no\" answers come with compliments. \n\nUltimately once we had one term sheet we had half a dozen very quickly, because one investor saying \"yes\" creates FOMO among the others.\n\nMaybe Canva was different and 99 doors were slammed in her face before one was open, but it could also be that the experience wasn't as disheartening as the description makes it seem.",

It typically takes way more than 100 pitches to raise. At 100 you're just getting started, it's about the calibration threshold where you start understanding what you're talking about. A few hundred more and there's a realistic chance.",

Doesn't mean Canva is \"worth\" $40B in terms of revenue, it just means a group of investors think/hope it will be worth this much some day.\n\nPersonally, I'm not seeing it. The concept is so basic and, as you pointed out, replicable, that it's hard to imagine them pulling in revenue anywhere close to justifying this valuation. Also worth noting that they only rose to prominence due to COVID.\n\nAnyway, not trying to crap on OP's message, which is to work hard and never give up. I just think this company had to \"work hard and never give up\" because their business isn't worth this kind of investment.",

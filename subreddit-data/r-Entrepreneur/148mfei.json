    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm a 23 year old from India. I do daytrading as well as have few other side hustles related to trading. Apart from that I have been in the marketing business extensively and have thorough knowledge of how to market a product. Other then that I'm currently learning data analysis via online courses available and like to play with data. Well that should be enough about me, now coming to my research data and then the idea.\n\nResearch - I was randomly going through some data from India which showed what percentage of Indian youths are addicted to any particular substance(eg - cigarettes, alcohol etc) and what percentage of them wanted to discontinue the substance and have tried hard yet they were unable to drop the habit. The figures astounded me since around 85% of youths aged between 22-40 were hooked to some form of addiction and from them atleast 60% had the habit of feeling guilty about their choices after they had consumed whatever they took.\n\nNow coming to the idea - Since I come from a finance background and I understand how important it is for someone to start investing from an early age, I was thinking what if I can build some form of platform which tracks the user's expenses (permission based obviously) and depending upon the limit set by the user it automatically deducts a percentage of money spent of addictive substances and invests it in some asset like Gold,MFs, ETFs etc.\n\nThe daily invested amount might look very meagre but when I did the math the final yearly figure was pretty impressive. Let me do the math below to illustrate the same.\n\nSo the most smoked cigarette in India costs \u20b918 (0.2$) and an average youth smokes atleast 2 cigarettes a day that will be \u20b936.\n\nNow if the user who smokes 2 cigarettes a day sets his investment percentage from the cost of addictive substances to be 100% then he will be investing \u20b918 everytime he smokes. So theoretically 2 cigarettes a day for 365 days of \u20b918 each will being the total yearly invested amount to \u20b913140 (160$).\n\nThe amount mentioned above might look small to US citizens or anyone from other nation which has a higher purchasing power parity than India but the maths when done according to the price of the substance according to their country will yield similar results.\n\nPROS -\n\n1. This modus operandi will not only help youth to start investing from an early age but will also make them aware of their expenses on addictive substances.\n\n2. The age group which I'm trying to target has taken interest in investing post corona as per data so we should have quite a huge userbase with minimal marketing.\n\n3. We can earn from multiple channels once we have enough users on our platform.\n\nCONS -\n\n1. I lack technical knowledge on how to create an app.\n\n2. I'm not sure about how to bring together investors to consider my idea.\n\n\nIf there are any doubts regarding the idea please let me know that will help me clarify my doubts as well.\n\nThank You all",

So I have a strong belief that this will definitely work especially in India.",

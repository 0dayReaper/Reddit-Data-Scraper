    "postText": "Hi there, I need many different credit card numbers because Facebook marketing is a joke and you get banned all the time for no reason. Now I have found a solution that will work and allow me to scale hard.\n\nIf an account gets banned, I need a new CC. I don't really want to be in a position where things are working and I have to wait 2-3 days for RBC to cancel my card and send me a new one. On Wise for example, I can just generate a new virtual card, same with Relay. I can't seem to find a Canadian alternative, that has a USD CC like that.\n\nI thought Wise was going to work, but the Credit card numbers online are provided in the currency of the business location, so CAD. I also have a USA C-corp, but in this case, I don't want to split the expenses/earnings and create a tax nightmare. What I mean here is pay for ads on my USA C-Corp and earn the money on CAD side. The reason I don't just do it on the USA side, is because I'll be taxed almost double.\n\nOne option is to get random people and say they are contractors and have employee cards made through RBC. At $30 a pop and requiring peoples IDs, it might be difficult to find those people.  \n\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

Also I'd recommend running your copy through an editor like [hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com) as there are some spelling errors (30 minute consultaion), and some very long sentences. As a business owner I liked seeing the testimonials, but I wonder if there's a different way of displaying these as they were a little difficult to read. Could be another way to display your graphic design skills too!",

Make a compelling headline that hints at a solution for their problems. Create a hook to keep them reading. Use a big idea to sell yourself. Make yourself something more than just a boring virtual assistant. There are thousands of those. You want to be something unique and new (it\u2019s only the way you position yourself, you\u2019ll be doing the same tasks).",

After reading this, you will know how to sell yourself better. \n\nAlternatively, pay someone to do it for you from Upwork. I\u2019m happy to rewrite your website copy for you, but it will cost you. \n\nYou\u2019re better off reading some materials and learning to do it yourself, as it is an invaluable skill (that you can also sell as a service).",

    "postText": "Hi everyone \n\nI\u2019m planning of opening a community Pharmacy in the future. \nHowever there is massive competition due to big chains and also independent stores.\nI was interested to know if you guys had any ideas on how to grow patient numbers and sales for a Pharmacy.\nThe plan is to have a community shop and also a website (potentially under a different name/brand) which would cater for people nationally. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated  \n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "I have a network of friends and family that own independent pharmacies. The business model is complex because you contract with the drug wholesalers and insurance companies. Insurance companies set the price, and you often lose money selling drugs. It gets worse every year. The 3 separate, unrelated business owners hate their business, hate the way insurance controls it, and they are all looking for a way out as it gets worse every year with the big retailers squeezing out the little guys. \n\nI don\u2019t have first hand knowledge of the business so of course do your diligence, but from what I know this is not a business to get into at this time.",

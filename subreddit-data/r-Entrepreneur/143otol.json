That way, you're constantly looking for new clients and work.   \nMany creators are struggling with pitching new clients and that's why I made this template.  \nThis is for the creator who feels as though they make fantastic creative work once they're hired. But cannot seem to close enough clients to make a sustainable income.  \nA good email pitch is crucial for photographers to make a strong first impression, showcase professionalism, highlight their portfolio, tailor their approach, include a clear call to action, and provide follow-up opportunities.   \nIt significantly enhances the chances of securing new clients and building a sustainable income.",

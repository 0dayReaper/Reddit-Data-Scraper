I know this shit now. \n\nI know marketing.. inbound leads to sales. \n\nI know CRM.. keeping customers tight. \n\nI know numbers.. can read and forecast PL, cashflow, balance sheets like a champ. \n\nI know systems.. ran business on autopilot for 2 years. \n\nI know VA\u2019s.. had 3 helping run my business. \n\nI wrote 3 books and built an app with no dev skills.\n\nDrank a ton of good beer with new friends whenever I wanted . \n\nWalked away with half mil to my name by end of it. Bought a house a few years ago\n\nSo fucking bring it. The biz was good to me and now it\u2019s done.  I don\u2019t give a shit. \n\nI\u2019ll come back stronger. Smarter. More resilient. \n\nTo the next chapter fuckers.",

Yes \nCan i do anything about it? No\nIf I could would I put those I care about after profit no.\n\nIt's tough and It may all go but there are bigger priorities in life, hopefully the measures the uk goverment have put in place will save us if not I will have to pick up the peices and start again.\n\nThere are many online businesses that will go to the wall, the ignorant misconception that online businesses dont have overheads or can just survive anything is such bollocks, my over heads are more than a bricks and mortar store, I have a large industrial unit I pay more in rent and rates for, I have higher insurance payments because it's all about volume so I hold more stock I have more staff than an average decorators merchant, my google bill slaughters an already tight margin my seo my social media campaigns accounts packaging costs national insurance they are all higher. \nEven if you are just in online services so many businesses are shut or not taking on new works they are struggling and still have overheads, so yes you do lose a business due to this u covid situation.\n\nThe Walter Mitty above seems like a total tool and not a sharp useful one, more like a rusty spanner for some shite piece of random ikea furniture probably called bellcry kunst.\n\nSorry turned into a bit of a rant not directed at you, life is a bit of a pressure cooker at the moment for us all I suppose.",

You've always got to have enough in the reserve tanks to be able to coast and hemorrhage money for at least a solid year. Maybe the type of business you were in was really cash intensive, but either way there's always a way to save another dollar here and another one there. Especially over the course of a decade. I would guess you fucked up and lived above your means. But at least you've got the right attitude and drive to grind a new one to even further heights. Cheers mother fucker!!!",

Either you paid pretty damn bad or you had like no other business expenses. But don't get me wrong... Half a million is a nice nest egg. I agree that those employees won't come back while unemployment is still paying them more but if you were good to work for I imagine they'd come back to a new business you start.",

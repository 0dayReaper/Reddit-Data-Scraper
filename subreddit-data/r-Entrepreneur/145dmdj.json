    "postText": "\n\nJust found this page and it couldn\u2019t have been at a better time. Here\u2019s the quick break down. I am 23, married with 2 kids. I have horrible legitimate work experience, but have done labor work my whole life. Started on a farm with grandpa, went to fast food for teen years in high school, worked a regular job till I had to become full time caretaker for my parent and survived under a disability check. Me, wife, and kids are now fully on our own for the first time, bills secured until the end of the year when lease is up, but I\u2019m job searching now knowing every fiber of my being loathes corporate ladder climbing. I\u2019ve had an entrepreneurial spirit since the start. I\u2019ve always dreamed of being my own boss with my own company. So there\u2019s the background, here\u2019s where I need help. \n\nI have very little know-how on the process but I\u2019m excited and eager to learn that along the way. However, Do I keep job searching and do things traditionally and try to build a business on the side? My worry with that is the corporate work trap. Would I have the time to build a business? Or do I take the little extra $$ I have now and start building one of the 1000 ideas I have brewing in my thinker? Can I build it to provide a sustainable income for my wife and kids in a span of 6 months? \n\nI need to see my situation from a different angle. Or hear from someone that has been in my shoes. I feel like there\u2019s an obvious \u201cduh\u201d point that needs to me made that I\u2019m missing and it\u2019s keeping me up at night.",

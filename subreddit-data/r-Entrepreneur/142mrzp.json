    "postText": "I've been in the SEO world for a few years now and while I didn't always own an agency of my own my journey began working for a local company who actually took great care of me. You might not know it from the title of this post but when I started the job I was 100% in love with it and honestly I would've considered working there till retirement assuming they continued to take care of me and vise versa;  however, one day the company was sold to a much larger agency and from that point on I hated my life. No longer did they care about creating meaningful processes or relationships and I just became another cog in the wheel until one day my management explained that they would be laying off any older team members and essentially replacing them with new employees or ones of their choosing. It really just left a bad taste in everyone's mouth but I guess I understand that it's hard to create a cohesive unit when you have people remembering how great it use to be before this new company. \n\nNow after being laid off and losing hope in corporate america I decided maybe it was time for a change and for me to start my own agency taking all the methods and ideas I've had but never got to use at this new company. Things were going better than I thought when I first started and one day I got approached by a company for SEO services. This company was located in Nashville and upon looking at the local competition I noticed a familar name in the footer of the website that read \"SEO Services Provided By (Insert Agency)\" and my hands almost started to sweat at the opportunity to stick it to my old employer. I threw this client the deal of a lifetime just for the opportunity and once he signed on I hit the ground running. We're talking new content, backlinks, schema, and anything and everything I could do to make sure to make sure my process was flawless. Not that I don't do this for everyone but this specific case had a little more personal touch to it and I wasn't going to lose. \n\nIt's been roughly six or seven months now and after tailing them for some time we've officially done it, we've passed them on Google both in the map pack and the organic search results and it feels so great. I know they probably won't ever know it's me but the fact that I know is all that matters. A win for the little guys over the corporate america a\\*\\*holes",

    "postText": "Hello all, I sold my SaaS [chartlog.com](https://chartlog.com) almost a year from today and have been in ideation mode since. I've fallen back on some bad habits when it comes to getting the gears grinding and starting a new business. The bad habits are mostly execution paralysis, negative self talk, wanting to build before vetting etc. I decided I would try and write down all of the lessons I've learned from my last business to help get me back on track. I figured I might as well put this out on reddit so that other's might gain some value from them. Feel free to chime in, disagree, expand on any points made below!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Once your revenue / profit starts to grow it may become very tempting to increase your salary, especially if you still are at your day job. Evaluate why you started the business in the first place, if it was to build something sustainable to support yourself and your family, put that money back into the business and only increase your salary when doing so will have a negligible impact on your growth. Patience is so important.\n2. It's pretty well known that the smart way to build a product / business is to vet it first, either by building an MVP, landing page, target customer research, or whatever. Something I didn't realize at first was that it's equally important to vet your go to market strategy. We started our product inside a tight knit trading community of 1000+ traders who quickly ate our product up. We assumed we could simply reach out to other trading communities and do the same but we didn't test that before building. We built our product first, gained traction in our community, then quickly found out the product was not of interest to other trading communities.\n3. If you have a founder, it's normal to butt heads and get into fights. Wanting a blissful peaceful relationship sounds nice on the outside but it would not be conducive to the business. You need someone who isn't afraid to challenge you, not someone who is a yes man.\n4. Having a founder is so important (for most people). Your founder ideally will be strong in areas that you are weak. What no one really talks about is emotional support. There will be times you will take a hit and fall and as such might be in the motivational trenches but having a partner can easily help you get back up again. It can be hard to self motivate, it's much easier to feed off a partner's motivation and vice versa.\n5. Never stop getting feed back. In the early stages focus on qualitative interviews and don't just listen to what the customer needs. Record the interviews and dig deep into the underlying problems the customer is trying to solve, frame them as desired outcomes and try to develop solutions that way. I would highly recommend JTBD or ODI.\n6. Don't fall in love with the product. If you are having challenges scaling or hitting PMF and your customers are showing interest that is outside your immediate domain / value proposition, don't be afraid to pivot. We had multiple ideas / chances to really expand outside our initial domain but were afraid to because it didn't fall within our initial value proposition. Who knows, maybe instead of selling we could have grown exponentially.\n7. Try not to fall in love with money. I remember first starting Chartlog and feeling the utmost bliss watching our MAUs go up and knowing we were helping people get better with their trading. Our main question was always \"How can we help traders reach their goals easier?\" and somewhere along the line the main question turned into \"How can we make more money?\"\n8. Discipline is so important especially if you are used to the 9-5 grind. After leaving my main job as a software engineer I found myself waking up late, going to the gym at random times of the day, taking breaks at random times, and mostly just having no set schedule. Not having discipline in your schedule really affects your business' progression and mental health. Not being disciplined makes it easy for laziness to become a normal part of your day.\n9. Always develop features as mini-mvps! You always want to take user feedback to create your initial \"rough draft\" of a feature and then iterate on it to make it better. Ideally you should be able to push out a rough draft feature in 2 weeks, get feedback from your users, and start on V2 of the feature. This helps you not waste time fully building out a feature that no one actually wants.\n10. Always think on the lines of \"how can I test this assumption?\" By now you've seen there's some pattern here, testing business ideas, testing feature ideas, testing go to market strategies etc. This is one theme I've picked up during my journey, always try and find a way to test any assumption you may have before going at it.",

I've been asked many times if I regret my decision, and thankfully I don't, as my mental health is more important. At least it was a fun experience!",

To me its a life achievement but in the grand scheme of things I find myself getting a little bummed every now and then about selling it. It makes me feel like I gave up and hence failed in some sort. Probably because the market got too difficult and we decided to sell instead of keeping up the grinding to finding PMF",

The idea is to get somethining minimal out as fast as you can and see if it works and/or it's of value to your user. If it is, start building on top of it, if it isn't, axe it. \n\nFor go to market this could be more difficult. In retrospective I think it could boil down to your mvp. For example in my scenario we built our mvp for our small trading community and it worked. After that we kept building on top of it for that same audience. What we should have done was immediately tried to reach out to other potential audiences and see if it would stick there as well. Instead we waited till the product was mature and then tried selling to others. In essence we ended up building a product for only a small subset of users.",

                    "comment": "What kind of idea is it? Is it completely novel that the government doesn't even know it needs yet or are you addressing some common problem? My initial thoughts are to see if there are RFPs out there asking for solutions to the problem you're solving. If there are that would be pretty good validation. Other than that I could see old school networking being a way to go. I once worked for a guy who had me developing a \"juvenile information system\" that essentially digitized juvenile convict information as opposed to keeping all of it under lock and key in some file cabinet. He would regularly schedule meetings with aldermen, representatives etc to talk about the problem and pitch the solution. There seemed to be general interest but when it came down to it the people who would actually use the software (the police agencies) wanted nothing to do with it. In your case I think you would need to find the right people to talk to and try reaching out but it's hard to say without really knowing what your product is.",

If you have access to these agencies I would just have regular conversations with them about the problem itself to gauge how big of a problem it is for them as well as how their life would be if that problem were solved. I would not mention the particular solution until getting their general feedback on the problem and how much they might be willing to pay for a solution. I would try and talk to at least 10 or 20 different people. After that, if it seems viable, build the MVP and get it out there as soon as possible and test again. This time testing is by acquiring some clients and getting feedback from them.",

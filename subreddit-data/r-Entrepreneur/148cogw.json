    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm sure this question has been asked a million times but here's goes.\n\nI have a Sales tech idea that will be an AI powered SaaS app.\n\nThing Is I have the vision, but I cannot code and I'm not even sure if what I want it to do can be done just yet. Also have very little funding.\n\nAny tips on where I go from here?",

            "comment": "If you've done your market research and know that there's a market for your idea then I'd start by completing a Value Proposition Canvas. This will help you to flesh out exactly which problems your product will solve (check out Uber's as that's a great example of one), then I'd create a Proof Of Concept prototype. A POC is different than an MVP as it doesn't have to work (ie you wouldn't need to build in the AI), you'd just need to show the process of the application working. Protopie is a good tool, but I've seen POCs built in Powerpoint which have proved the 'what' without the 'how'. A solid POC will then help you to either find funding, or start bootstrapping. Good luck!",

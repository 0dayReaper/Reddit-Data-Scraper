We are based in Malta, and looking for an official opening at the end of August.   \nAs a white-label project out of Sweden, we adhere to Swedish financial law as well to Malta and the EU's laws and regulations. As of now, we will be present in Malta, Cyprus, and Germany.\n\nIf you are from Europe and feel like you have marketing skills, as a start-up, I would love to work closely with you, provide you with marketing material and hopefully grow in your country. No previous experience is needed, however, experience in marketing is highly appreciated.\n\n**THE BEST PART** is our commission. As I already mentioned, we are a startup, so we have offered our affiliates the very best commissions on the market. Until we have an official launch, we are offering our affiliates up to 25% revenue share of all profits the bank makes (including debit card sales, monthly payments, and transaction fees).\n\nWe are an alternative way of financing to conventional banks, offering fast banking through your app, visa debit card, and much more freedom in financing with much less friction. We will offer this service to personal clients.\n\nAlready we work with business clients and have over 500.000 EUR of monthly turnover. All of our clients are  happy with our services, which gives us confidence to open the services for personal clients as well.\n\nYou will receive an affiliate link dedicated to yourself so that you will be able to track all your future clients. Since you will have 25%, in the near future, you will be able to create under links for future affiliates that will work under your network.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you feel free to make a quick registration on our web, no strings attached. You will receive a non-binding contract that will grant you your rights and commission and will have no legal obligation to yourself.\n\n[https://voltapay.eu/contact-us-form/](https://voltapay.eu/contact-us-form/)\n\nI am Mihail, founder of Volta Pay, and I welcome all enthusiasts to apply and grow together with us.

I have extensive experience working on marketing for financial services businesses, including HSBC. \n\nI'm acutely aware of the rise of challenger banks such as Monzo, Revolut, Starling in the UK and payment gateways such as Wise. Branding, style and UX play key roles in their marketing.\n\nI've only had a quick scan of your site, but a couple of things come to mind.\n\nI see you state an aim to: \"allow our customers to experience easier, more secure money management and online payments.\" \n\nMay I ask what research data this is founded on? My own experience with online banking and payments may not be typical, but I find it easy as pie and super secure.\n\nOn the Corporate Banking page, you state \"We offer the best pricing on the market. with the most flexible fees...\"\n\nCan you substantiate these claims? Do you guaranteed to always fulfil the promise of best and most flexible?\n\nFeel free to expand on your company story - the how and why Volta Pay came about and what make sit stand apart from established alternatives.",

It's called Systems Sync and the idea came about as I've often found myself overwhelmed with the number of systems my business was juggling. I figured I can't be the only one and I was right!   \nThe concept is a simple, user-friendly tech audit to give founders a comprehensive view of all the systems they're currently using in their business, provide insights on how they can be streamlined, and suggest ways to make operations more efficient and secure, ultimately cutting down on unnecessary costs and wasted time.   \nI'm launching a beta version next week and I'm looking for some honest feedback on concept, landing page, everything. I genuinely want to make this something that can benefit entrepreneurs, and I also want to learn from this first launch experience as it's a different way of working for me.   \nI'm grateful for any tips or insight or feedback! If you're interested, you can check it out here: www.diamondminds.co.uk/systems-audit   \nI really appreciate any support or feedback from this community - I'm a longtime lurker on my other account and am working on pushing myself out of my comfort zone!",

I would say your [tweet](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1404528553601814530) with suggestions for start up distribution might be worth including on this post. I know it's something I've found challenging. I also really appreciate your blog post about empathetic management, I wish it wasn't so uncommon to see such a human perspective in tech. I would personally be devastated if a team I built ended up with a toxic culture. \n\nAnd yeah, no doubt it is a ton of work. I've come to realize that while there definitely are some concrete benefits to freelancing while on this path, a lot of my view of it was sort of underpants gnome-y when I started (If you can sit on a beach and freelance, surely you can launch your own projects and freelance! xD). There are pros and cons and the approach you took of launching on the side while employed has some big pros. It is interesting to know how many projects you built, but 3 of 20 seems pretty good to me! Quantity over quality, or at least quantity and then quality, seems to be the way to go. I do need to do more work to internalize that. It's all good in theory but as you note the emotional impact of failure can be taxing, and even more so when you inevitably grow attached to the thing you are building. I feel like I could ask you a million questions but I'd really like to be respectful of your time. If you don't mind, one final question your last comment sparked - During the time that you built these ~20 projects in the last few years, did you make a point of only working on one at a time, working on some concurrently, or did you perhaps just work on projects as they arose organically? I feel constantly overwhelmed when it comes to this, so I'd be really curious to know if you did too and if so how you dealt with it.\n\neta: Fixed the broken link to twitter, oops!",

I spent a ton of time writing about empathetic management since I feel like there aren't a ton of people that worked in shitty retail jobs then became executives but still remember what it feels like to be that retail worker.  \n\n\nAsk away, I love talking about this stuff. I have like a borderline problem with coming up with ideas then doing an obnoxious amount of research to learn the ins and outs of the industry, then sometimes starting and building things.\n\nI've only sold software companies, but in the last couple years I've looked into:\n\n\\- Artisan Black Walnut Syrup\n\n\\- Zero alcohol CBD whisky\n\n\\- A clothing company that only makes one shirt\n\n\\- Liquid soap with only 3 ingredients\n\n\\- Mushroom farming\n\nAnd more.\n\nIn that same time, I've also put together a ton of small software projects. I'd say I have one or two new ideas a month I take a deep dive on and research quite a bit.   \n\n\nMost I work on concurrently, even if it's just sketching out ideas in Notion or wireframes in Whimsical. It occasionally makes it to Figma which is pretty much the last stop before I actually try to develop things. That's for software projects.  \n\n\nFor the physical products, I usually start small scale to understand the ins and outs. Like I was one of the few people making Black Walnut syrup this year by tapping walnut trees in our backyard. Turns out the unit economics really don't scale since you need 4x as many Walnuts as you do Sugar Maples and there's not enough demand to sustain the premium you would need to charge initially. But at least now I have a bunch of syrup!  \n\n\nHope that helps? I feel like I mainly just wrote about syrup.",

I get a bit addicted to things, so I don't let myself over indulge by building a gaming rig or purchasing new games really. I remember when the the new Smash came out and I didn't get anything done for weeks!\n\nPlus I now have an awesome 9 month old, so that's really my focus now.",

Followed you on twitter.\n\nI did a very similar post a few days ago on /r/SaaS which was titled '[The cost to run a SaaS platform with a few million Annual Recurring Revenue](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/o1x0yk/the_cost_to_run_a_saas_platform_with_a_few/)'. In the post I also added the cost/month per saas platform summing up to about 23k/month:\n\n*The summary:*  \n*Server Stuff - 9625\u20ac/month*  \n*Development/Product/Devops - 1370\u20ac/month*  \n*Marketing - 4890\u20ac/month*  \n*Customer Success - 2881\u20ac/month*  \n*All Company Tools - 2732\u20ac/month*  \n*Admin/Finance/Team - 1303\u20ac/month*\n\nSeeing all these upvotes (1.1k) I am thinking I should have cross-posted to this sub \ud83d\ude04\n\nI am also using Notion, slack, figma, VS Code, Github and Vercel but for our company that ends up as being about 700ish/month for those tools.

We'll tell you all about the moves Netflix made to become the crowned head in the streaming space.\n\n# Netflix Learned From Its Mistakes.\n\nEvery company, irrespective of size and industry, makes mistakes. Netflix did too. But what set Netflix apart is that the company learned from its errors and took user feedback seriously.\n\nFor instance, Netflix announced Qwikster in 2021, which was a modern rebranding of its original DVD rental business. Qwikster was meant to be for rentals, while Netflix would be for streaming.\n\nBut this announcement was immediately unpopular among Netflix's subscribers, who felt that it was a cash-grab by the company, making users pay two subscription fees. The debacle worsened when Netflix increased its subscription fee by 60% to account for Qwikster.\n\nNearly 800,000 users unsubscribed from the platform as a result. Did Netflix go ahead with the Qwikster idea? Of course not. Instead, the company scrapped it completely before the official launch.\n\nHad Netflix not been open to feedback from its users and agile enough to scrap Qwikster, the streaming giant might have remained a distant dream.\n\n# Netflix Expanded to Over 190 Countries.\n\nNetflix's globalization strategy has helped the company become a household name not only in the US but across the globe. By 2017, Netflix was operational in more than 190 countries, with 73 million of its subscribers in 2018 based outside the US.\n\nThe expansion came with its fair share of hurdles and complexities. One, Netflix had to get regional content deals, sometimes even by country. Two, it has to meet regulatory restrictions in every country. Three, the company had to ensure the provision of local-language streaming media in countries where the subscribers preferred it.\n\nMore importantly, Netflix had fierce competition in some regions. For example, India and France already had a well-established local-language media sphere that took away the first-mover advantage from the company. India and Germany also already had Amazon Prime, making it difficult for Netflix to push through.\n\nBut Netflix managed to bag more international subscribers than any other streaming service due to its three-stage expansion strategy.\n\nHere's how it spanned:\n\n* **Stage 1**: In 2010, Netflix expanded to Canada. The audience was much similar, spoke the same language, and shared geographical closeness.\n* **Stage 2**: Netflix rendered 50 countries, but they weren't chosen at random. Instead, the company selected regions based on consumer affluence and internet availability.\n* **Stage 3**: By this time, Netflix had learned a lot from its previous expansions. So, it enters over 100 countries with a range of new offerings, like local language shows, dubbing, subtitles, and a global content library.\n\n# Netflix Selected a North Star Metric.\n\nMany companies fail because they do not have a metric that's The One. For example, for Slack, it was the number of messages companies sent. So, they tried to get every company to send 2,000 messages because that's when they saw the platform's full potential. Similarly, Dropbox used the number of users who put one or more files in storage to determine its success.\n\nNetflix's chosen metric was subscriber count. Every decision the company makes is geared toward getting more subscribers onboard and reducing churn. That's exactly how the company went from 209 million paid subscribers in 2021 to over 300 million in a short span of two years.",

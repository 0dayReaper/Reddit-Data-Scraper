    "postText": "Background: I'm an accountant with just over 10 years of experience, and I'm currently employed as a Corporate Controller/VP Finance and make low six figures. \n\nRecently, I have had a few people I know reach out to me for help with some of the more technical accounting/finance/risk management parts of running their businesses. I've had so many of them in fact that it's cutting into my very limited family time, so I started charging $250 an hour for my help, which, surprisingly, everyone has been more that willing to pay. \n\nMy question for the group would be thig. What steps could I take to transition this from a limited side thing, into a truly viable business? Has anyone else had a successful consulting/fractional CFO business?",

            "comment": "Fractional CFO/Accountant here. A couple pointers:\n\n\nDon't do payroll or get involved in payroll if you can help it. If you do, get a good price for it. It's easily the lowest ROI \"accounting\" related service extended by most firms.\n\n\nTarget a specific set of verticals rather than seeing what sticks. You're technical so you hopefully have some specific fields you're more than qualified to sit in on.\n\n\nA big part of Fractional CFO work is \"financial soundboarding\". Lots of accounting firms talk to their clients once a month at best. CFOs should have fewer but bigger clients that you can dedicate more time to and be deeply integrated with their finance team. The soundboard part is \"talking shop\" consistently and regularly with the client and making sure there are no last minute surprises. The difference is whether the owner/directors inform you of a large investment or whether they seek out your input on the prospective investment before they do it.\n\n\nI don't know enough about risk management to give input but many clients are going to want you to be able to give tax advice. I'm assuming you have your CPA if you're a Controller in Technical: leverage that during your initial sales call.\n\n\nAfter you've gotten your target verticals and done your business plan, get some glowing reviews from your existing clients so you take the front page on search engines.\n\n\nGood luck.",

I've made the decision to quit my job this month.\n\nSince January, Ihave completed or have signed contracts for about half my day job salary.  I'm considering it a 6 month runway.  I get my insurance from my wife's work, so that's not an issue.\n\nThere's never not going to be a risk, and there's probably going to be a financial dip, but I just can't grow it any further, or sustain it without burning out.  To me, this is the point where you have to take the leap.\n\nIt's never going to be a sure thing.  You just have to do it.",

    "postText": "Hi. I started my business last year, we service the parking lots and outside areas of shopping centers.\n\nCurrently the shift is M W F SA 5am-9am. I have hired and fired about 5 people since I began hiring last month. Everyone I hire and then fired due to no call no show, except the first employee who worked the first day then did a no call no show. Everyone has been fired and I\u2019ve let my most recent employee go this morning. The pay is 18 an hour (Iowa). \n\nI\u2019m sure the small shift and the 5am start time is why every single person doesn\u2019t show up (tried night, due to safety concerns that is not an option) but also I\u2019ve only been hiring for a month and am not calling it quits... am I doing something wrong?",

That sounds to me like a scheduling/communication issue. Are you sure they all knew the time before they were hired? And which days they were supposed to work? Is there some gate or other road block from allowing them to get there? Did you ask any of them why they didnt show?",

They are told verbally and through text the location day and time they work as well. I even reminded some the day before.\n\n2 employees gave reason which were 1 due to personal family issues (said timing isn\u2019t an issue, got the day off, was 30 min late the next day of work) and the other said they felt sick.\n\nI have been hiring people around 20-23 age range though which may be a huge factor worth mentioning.",

When I was in college, I never had a class before noon. \n\nAlso, if they are actually in college, they arent likely to be able to get a second job with those hours, and $18/hour for max 20 hours a week may not cover rent alone.",

If the salary is good, people will make an effort (so they keep the job) if you're paying the same or similar hourly wage to jobs with full shifts and/ or shifts at nicer times, they will leave.\n\nWhen I had my first company, we had pretty shitty work at pretty shitty times, so we paid between double and tripple ofwhat other companies would pay for people with the same skill level, but for less dirty work at normal hours.\n\nYou may think it is expensive and the salary is too high. However the right salary is the one people are willing to work for.\n\nOther options if you are in the US would be to offer health care insurance for employees doing at least 4 or 5 shifts a week. That is how UPS gets people to be reliable in working short shifts (reliable in showing up every day and reliable in sticking with the company for a long period, so you don't have to keep finding and training new people all the time)",

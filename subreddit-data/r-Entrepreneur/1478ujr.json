I've worked with online stores, customer service providers, accountants, marketing companies, software companies, and even musicians. My rate is only $4/hour and I can be very efficient and save you a lot of time.\n\nYou can find the range of services I offer in [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/comments/145kczb/for_hire_online_assistant_data_entry_clerk_for/)\n\nIf anyone is interested, hit me up! :D  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I guess, as in most remote jobs, that's how you develop a trusting relationship with your employer.   \n\n\nAnd I almost forgot, there are some agreements that apply to remote employees.

At best a VA could help me setup my to-do list, but that generally is only 10 minutes of my day. Everything else (project management, assigning the right people to the right tasks, answering technical questions/mails, code reviewing) still has to be done by me.",

I put the project on Github and asked them to make several changes.  They made many of them but so far in an opaque way that makes me very nervous about how they built it.  I can see a version they are hosting locally and updates there but they have not made a single commit to the project for me to review.  They also removed a few features.  They don't seem to grasp the big picture of what it is that I want them to do and don't have great attention to detail.  I think part of it is I have to be much more specific and really put my foot down on transparency.\n\nI also hear that code is blatantly copied and pasted from other sources.  For example, an event planning app may end up with variable names from an e-commerce store.  I will find out soon if this is the case for my project.  As the owner this creates a lot of work because I want to know I am building on top of something solid.  I need to understand it so I can fix bugs and I don't want to be dealing with spaghetti code.",

But get a group, get professional looking, get the free version of canva do up so professional looking ads. I don\u2019t know what the internet reliability situation is but you could reach out and undercut some of those big ones set up by foreigners in Philippines. A lot of businesses only need a small team these days. You\u2019ve obs got internet. Skill up on AI tools and sell your team as a small skilled team with the rocket of AI but human touch. Feel free to message, I can\u2019t hire you but I can help with how to sell it lol because I\u2019ve worked places that have contracts with those big companies out of Philippines\n\n\nEdit I might want to hire you in a month or so but it would just be some help with project stuff to start so not necessarily long term. But as above also happy to help with selling anything to the big companies if you get a team together lol. I\u2019ll message you",

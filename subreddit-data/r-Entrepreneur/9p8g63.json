Its all so stupid, we are getting fed that the idea of a successful entrepreneur is to have expensive cars and hot girls dancing arround while making pasive money all day. \n\nAnd the reality of a successful entrepreneur is fucking insomnia, solitude, dealing with stupid clients, deadlines, investors behind your back tracking everything, mad girlfriends, 0 free time...\n\nOf course there are entrepreneurs living life and earning sexy money. But not everyone. 97% don't.\n\nWhen im \"sidehustling\" at home after a long 8h of working and check instagram to see this kind of shit.. it makes me laugh. \n\n\nShoutout to all grinding dads that sidehustle for a better family future.\n\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the goldie random hard worker(s)!

The truth is you dont have to be be at full speed every second of the day, you dont always have to feel motivated or brave or determined and it doesnt help to never sleep and only care about money. Sometimes it is just slow or difficult or complicated and thats ok too.  ",

I'm pretty anti-social, but I'll go.\n\nMajority of our neighbors are what I would say somewhat-wealthy. Probably a bit above middle class in NJ. There are lots of physical therapists wives with marketing husbands on our block, a few with their own practices, along with investors and such. There are like 4-5 Teslas within the 25 or so houses in our immediate area. Our cars and house are very modest.\n\nDuring the block party I met a wife who was so down to earth and super cool it was amazing. I basically stayed away from all the 'investor bros' and hung around her. She was saying how she's ashamed she bought furniture from Bobs, but she said it's the most comfortable couch ever and she loves it.\n\nI'm tired of these wealthy wannabes who push that lifestyle and show off. It's so refreshing to meet someone real and not putting on some facade. Then again, what did I expect in this neighborhood I suppose.",

Maybe these passive income guys found a niche or unsaturated opening in the market and are cashing in and that's good for them, but to sell false dreams in expensive online seminars is pretty low.\n\n  As a person who sometimes creates success memes for the purpose of advertising my graphics business, the majority of responses I get are from  desperate graphic designers and marketers who are trying to offer their own graphic design services and branding to me.

This is not criticism, but hopefully encouragement for you. \n\nI hope your businesses flourish, and that you can learn to not let social media consume even 1 nano second of positive energy from you. The fact you recognize this trend and fake way of life online means you\u2019re already half way there. Be well stranger. ",

Work by day, watch your kids fight to the death over a smashed Lego \"house\" by night. \n\nThe whole \"#hustle\" lifestyle thing is pretty shitty, especially when it's cunts in amazing cars with girls with perfectly round tits with a list for 4\" wide dick... \n\nI'm sitting at home right now, curious George on TV, my kids are honestly wrecking a box of Lego.. they haven't noticed I'm sitting here actually. My missus is cooking right now and just got some chilli in her eye. I'm pretending I didn't notice that happened.. I'm a tattoo artist, a one man business so most likely handle less cash that most ballers here.. smashed out a few tattoos today, it wasn't a particularly notable day, but I made money and people got cool tattoos.\n\nNow I'm sitting on my couch flicking through Reddit. THIS is the side hustle. ",

She takes acting classes and disguises herself as a man for a year to to look at the world of masculinity and write a book about it, but one chapter in particular will really speak to you. I think its the second or third chapter and she joins an MLM business and she writes about the significant toll it takes on the men who work there and the dirty psychological tactics the management and company employ to keep people working. Some of what you wrote makes me think of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe book isn't sexist, she takes an unabashed look and admits to her own biases and where she was wrong. The other chapters aren't related to anything in this sub, but the chapter I mentioned (I Think it's chapter 6: Work) is very much related to the frustrations you're feeling.",

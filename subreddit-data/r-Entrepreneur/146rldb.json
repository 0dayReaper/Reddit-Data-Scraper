    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for upvotes. Finally, i am able to write a post. :D \n\nI've asked similar question in other sub, but i didn't get the answers i needed. \n\nI am a veterinary doctor and i have deep experience in a niche field (pet raw nutrition). Most of my career, i was working in my country, sometimes i had some referrals from surrounding countries (eastern Europe). I don't have any FB, IG business profile, no webpage, nothing. My services are alive only from the referrals/recommendations from the other clients. \n\nAt this moment, i see a huge need in pet nutrition services (consulting, troubleshooting, curing diseases with nutrition only, individual diet plans, couching, seminars, content, ect). The good news are that my competition offers mostly basic understanding, lacking deep technical experience. \n\nI want to enter to USA, UK, Western Europe market and offer my services there. Services are fully remote. I understand that in order to be seen, i need at least FB, IG profiles and pump the content. I understand that, but how i should proceed regarding google? What are the steps to be reachable/findable on google search? Seo, original content, ect? \n\nI am not experienced in these matters, so i would like any technical advice. Thanks in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Focus on the social media content first, that way you can establish your brand name first because its easier\n\nYou likely wont rank in google immediately anyway so if you truly want to focus on getting of the ground why not just focus on posting in a place where you can get eyeballs immediately \n\nThis will benefit you mor in the long run because it will validate whether people will even buy your services in the next 90 days (if you really work hard on your socials) vs spending 18-24 months trying to get seo traffic only to realize nobody wants what you have to offer\n\nYou should be trying to get beta testers right now and test the market, not trying to focus on set and stone traffic, because you may end up selling something completely different by the time its all said and done",

            "comment": "Hey! You asked a tough question, but I'll do my best to explain the answer in a way that's easier to follow, even if you're not familiar with marketing.\n\n**Providing value** \\- the ultimate marketing strategy you can have.\n\nYou mentioned that there's a significant demand for pet nutrition services. One effective approach is to provide free answers to common questions in your field. By sharing your expertise, you can showcase your competence. Additionally, when you answer frequently asked questions, you increase the likelihood of being discovered online.\n\nWhen you decide on your strategy, the next question is which channels to use. Whether you go for offline or online marketing, social media or Google ads, or even both, it's crucial to have a website. Having a website demonstrates credibility and a professional approach to your business. Moreover, it serves as a foundation for your marketing efforts by allowing you to collect data and generate leads.\n\nSo, here's some simplified advice on what to do:\n\n1. Create a logo using Canva or purchase one for a few dollars from logo creation websites. Don't spend too much time on complex branding at this stage; you can work on it later.\n2. Get a website up and describe your services as clearly as possible.\n3. Write 5-6 blog posts answering common questions in your field. Also, dive into some interesting questions you've encountered in your practice.\n4. Start by creating a Facebook page and focus on it during the initial months. Share your blog posts, create engaging posts, and aim to build a community.\n5. Learn about Facebook advertising and allocate a few dollars to boost your posts.\n6. Do some research. Look into successful pet businesses and ask yourself, 'What makes me feel inclined to buy from them?' Analyze their marketing techniques and try implementing some of them on your own.\n7. Set up a Google Ads account and create 2-3 ads about those common questions, linking to your blog posts.\n\nI hope my answer is helpful. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to answer them.\n\nEDIT: Typos.",

Over 40% of websites are already built on that platform. If you need help with customizations, you can even hire a WordPress web developer. If you don't know any, just shoot me a message. But if you have a few weeks to spare, you can easily learn to do it yourself.",

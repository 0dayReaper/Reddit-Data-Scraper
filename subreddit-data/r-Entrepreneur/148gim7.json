Last night, I had my first user actually use it but I don't think they stuck around to watch the final result (I don't actually know) and they certainly didn't spend any money.\n\nAnyways, since I have the resume, I have his phone number. Is there any etiquette that says I shouldn't cold call him and ask them what about my product he liked and what he didn't like?",

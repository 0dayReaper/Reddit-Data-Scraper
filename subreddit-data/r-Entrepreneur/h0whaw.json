    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm working in a growth marketing agency. Marketing tools are 30% of what we do, so we use them a lot and experiment with the new ones as much as possible.\n\nThere are thousands of tools and it's easy to get lost, so I wanted to share the tools we use most on a daily basis. And divide the list into 14 categories.\n\nI thought this could be handy for Entrepreneurs subreddit.\n\nWhy adopt tools? I see marketing tools as tireless colleagues. If you can't hire an employee, choosing the right tool can solve your problems, because they\n\n* Are super cheap.\n* Work 7/24 for you.\n* Don\u2019t make mistakes.\n* Don\u2019t need management. (or needless management)\n* Help you to automate the majority of your lead gen process.\n\nOnwards to the list.\n\n(With the pricings post ended up quite long, you can find a link in the end if you want to check the prices)\n\n# Email marketing tools\n\n**#1 ActiveCampaign** is armed with the most complicated email automation features and has the most intuitive user experience.

Plus I like Ahrefs personally because they work on their content to educate their customers.  Both Youtube and written content.\n\nMy main reason was usability, the feel of the tool and being better at keywords, the latter is a big plus for me.\n\nDon't take my word for it, also read this by a better SEO person:\n\n[https://backlinko.com/ahrefs-vs-semrush](https://backlinko.com/ahrefs-vs-semrush)\n\nIn the end, it's up to personal usage and preferences.",

Is it as simple in small businesses as highlighting customer segments that you do business in, what your customer personas are, and how to do marketing campaigns, and digital marketing in, and branding, pr, and so on. Is this about it? I gotta highlight a strategy, then use a process to highlight which activities and apps to use. Then manage it?",

I'm going to spoiler tag this so my long-windedness doesn't dominate the chat.\n\n&gt;!I was about to post that this list is really amazing! but for entrepreneurs, you should try to hand off SOME of this list to your marketing person as soon as you can.  Digital Marketing, CRM, Automation is really just one aspect of running your company overall marketing strategy, what about the customers who HATE email spam, HATE Internet BS, WILL NEVER SIGN UP for a newsletter.  What about them?  But maybe they are NOT your customers either - so it really is a subject matter as complex as playing a musical instrument or learning a foreign language.  !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sure I can show you a few chords, and even teach you some easy songs, but are you going to be good enough to write and perform a song that could entertain people enough that they give you their hard-earned money?  !&lt;\n\n&gt;!With that being said I fully recognize the pressure right now, and some are just not in a position to pay for this.  So YES you CAN trade your time for learning how to do a lot of the HIGHLY EFFECTIVE digital marketing.  But if you do not have the time, or don't want to, you just have to pay for it, that simple.  I would start with independent marketing consultants, they are cheaper than an agency and you don't have to lose equity.!&lt;",

To do the things to not plateau. Which just hit me, that a business will grow and plateau until  strategy and business reforms take place. Then again plateau, growth, plateau and on and on.\n\nI think you are right that just learning it and taking the time to do it is best if there is no cash to go for a proper effective 2 week course to get 1 year worth of info. Or to take on a full time consultant, and things like this.\n\nOn another note I think learning the fundamentals  helps to build up to a level where you are 9/10 but really, really solid and able to be the most fluent using basic fundamentals. But it requires a lot of courage to break out of the rules and develop a unique style ontop of the solid fundamentals that is top tier. So I think this is a bit like comparing someone like the boxer floyd mayweather or Lomachenko (fundamentally sound boxers with really fluent and tactical aggressive styles), compared to a deontay wilder or a manny pacquiao. The last two fighters are great with their lack of fundamental gameplanning, strategy and style  but the first two are the best at those. They simply have better fundamentals and rely on them, while having a strategy and gameplan that gives them a distinct advantage. \n\nIn this way I think it's a way to approach business by taking the already well tuned fundamentals and turn it into a refined unique style to the ceo. So the business can prosper by having someone that can tackle issues, and create a tough vision and can fulfill it.",

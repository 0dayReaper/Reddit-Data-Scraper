    "postText": "As a founder, I've faced the overwhelming pressure and unending to-do lists that have often pushed me towards the precipice of burnout. I bet many of you can relate to this. \r\n\nI started the company 5 years ago. We are now 50 people and we have raised $15M in funding until now. When I was raising Series A, I hit a point where I seriously considered quitting. I have improved a lot since then, and I have implemented different strategies in the company to prevent burnout not only for the founders but for the entire team.\n\n**1. Taking breaks is not something you should feel ashamed of**: Easier said than done, I know. But taking time for yourself is not only healthy, it's vital. I used to feel bad on the weekends if I wasn\u2019t working. Even in the evenings if I finish the job a bit earlier. When you start taking REAL breaks, you feel how energized you are when you come back. \r\n\n**2. Set Boundaries:** Remember, it's okay to say \"No.\" Protect your time and energy like they're the crown jewels. I struggle a lot with conflict, so I accepted many things I should not have taken. I\u2019ve worked on this a lot with my coach, but it is probably the hardest thing for me to do. \r\n\n**3. Show vulnerable:** With your team, your co-founders, and with other entrepreneurs. You can\u2019t imagine how comforting it is to see that you all share the same pains. That you are not alone.\r\n\n**4. The positive feedback is more important than the negative one:** I've found this to be a great mood lifter.  We tend to tell our team members the things they need to improve. But if you tell them the things they do well, they will repeat them. Even if they are just tiny things like \u201cI loved how you lead that meeting\u201d or \u201cThis document that you created is super well structured, very helpful\u201d. \r\n\n**5. Hire a Coach (for you and for your team)**: You wouldn't believe the difference it makes. A good coach helps you maintain perspective, balance, and improve productivity. I have had one since our Series A and we also offer employees the option to get one. We tried **BetterUp** first, and we moved now to **Wave.ai** because they work both for CEO/Founder coaching and employee coaching. \r\n\n**6. Practice Mindfulness:** This has been a major key for me. A little bit of calm in the chaos can do wonders. I use Headspace for this. All employees have access to a **Headspace** subscription if they want it. **Calm** is another good option. Even though there are lots of Youtube videos for mindfulness, these apps help you build \"a plan\", starting with simple sessions and moving to more complex ones. \r\n\n**7. Delegate**: You've got a team for a reason. Seriously, delegating won't make your direct reports feel bad, the other way around, they'll burnout if you don't let them make decisions! \r\n\n**8. Stay Active:** A bit of exercise each day keeps burnout at bay. I do CrossFit every day. I used to hate doing exercise and now if I need to skip one day, I completely feel how I\u2019m way more tired during the whole day (I do it first thing in the morning),\r\n\n**9. Sleep Well:** Your bed is your best friend. If you need more time to finish a task, never ever take that time from your sleep! \r\n\n**10. Socialize:** Remember, you're a human first, and a founder second. Make time for friends, family, and fun.\n\nImplementing these strategies has been a game-changer for me and my team. I hope they do the same for you! If you have any other tips or strategies to avoid burnout, feel free to share! We're all in this together.",

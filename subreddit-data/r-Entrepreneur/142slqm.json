    "postText": "I\u2019m currently 17, and I\u2019m taking a gap year from my studies (between high school and university) to pursue some of my personal interests (entrepreneurship, academic research, etc.) and I\u2018m debating whether it\u2019s worth reaching out to small businesses and asking them if they would like a website to boost their online presence.\n\nI\u2019m really passionate about design, and I seriously wouldn\u2019t mind charging them anywhere from 100-500 pounds, which means I\u2019ll be severely undercutting current professional design firms, and \u2014 at the risk of sounding narcissistic \u2014 I have pretty amazing design skills as I\u2019ve been creating and refining my design taste since the age of about 13.\n\nI was just wondering whether it\u2019d be a good idea with regards to the current economic state, and whether business would be welcoming to this idea.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would you outsource it, especially from a 17 year old with no experience?\n\n*Also, if any of you guys need any help with website creation (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, Webflow etc.), I\u2019d happy to help and send designs for free.*",

Rather than asking for advice, you should go out and get feedback from the market/customers. After initial market research and customer feedback you can iterate your offering faster than any advice ever will get you.\n\nA great way to start is to do the first gig for free/cheap but get a great testimonial in return, setting yourself up for success for the next paying customer. Good luck!",

You can start with a simple portfolio website and showcase your work, and then look for small businesses in your area who may need a website. Don't let age be a barrier, you got this!",

There\u2019s nothing wrong with being young, industries don\u2019t discriminate by age, only skill. Since you\u2019ve been doing design since 13, you should be able to outsource your work without needing experience first because you already have it. Just make sure to have a thorough hiring process and teach your employees exactly how you design. From there on it\u2019s just marketing and refining your employee\u2019s skills.",

Can only be a positive experience for you no matter how it goes you\u2019ll learn and grow.\n\nCouple tips:\n- successful businesses and people wanting to build successful businesses don\u2019t want cheap things. Amazing products sold at a cheap price still seem cheap. If you can bring the goods don\u2019t feel that you need to undercut or be cheap. \n- you mention design when talking about a website but today it\u2019s as much or more about the copy and marketing creativity/effectiveness than \u201cdesign\u201d\n\nAt 17\u2026 I would recommend you get and read these books:\n- building a storybrand\n- rich dad poor dad \n- seven figure agency\n- you can\u2019t teach a kid to read a bike at a seminar\n- the success principles by jack canfield\n\nA couple will be available at your library, a couple you might need to order online.",

There will always be economic shifts, so even if you had a successful web business, you would need to navigate the times.   \nPick up the phone and call 20 businesses and see if they need help. Just get the first paying customer and keep going.",

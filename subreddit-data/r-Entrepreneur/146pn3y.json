    "postText": "My parents have a factory in the Philippines that can virtually create any textile, however their niche is more towards physical reflectors and incorporating reflective material in clothing for road safety ie. vests, jackets, hanging reflectors, slap wraps. What would be some good ideas for leveraging their production capabilities for my own use/business  \n\n\nsome ideas already:\n\n\\-Trendy concepts turned into clothes  \n\\-Partnerships with designers to create a line of clothing that incorporates reflective materials  \n\\-Finding more companies that would buy bulk reflective materials (construction companies, air traffic) (parents basically already doing this) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

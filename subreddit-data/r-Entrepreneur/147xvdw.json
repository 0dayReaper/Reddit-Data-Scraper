            "comment": "Technically the answer is yes. If you own many houses you have to at least rent them to sustain profit. Doing that at scale can be very complex. Buying and selling many houses and consistently making a profit, is a business. You take on risk etc. You haven\u2019t created anything new by doing this, and it isn\u2019t really creative, but you are a sole proprietor, of a company which acquires and sells houses. That\u2019s an entrepreneur.\n\nNow personally I think of it more as a person who invents something, if not a product, a system of operation. I feel like someone who buys and sells houses is more of an investor in a certain asset class than an entrepreneur, but by the definition you could call them one.",

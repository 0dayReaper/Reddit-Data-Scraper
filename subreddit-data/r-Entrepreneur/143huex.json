A few things that I have learned as their web developer/social media manager (they are older and don't really understand how to utilize social media): \n\nAdvertise a lot, whatever you are selling/providing, people have to know about it. \n\nThis one is obvious, given what your business is, but having a well built, nice looking, and functional website is super important. I specified nice looking, because you want it to be easy to navigate, user friendly (for things like adding items to the cart, understanding the prices, etc.). Plus it is a great way to have links to your contact information, business information, social media links, etc. \n\nI'm sure that both of those points are things that you have already thought of, and as I said, I am in no way an expert. Just a dude who is attempting a similar project, and figuring out a lot as I go along haha.",

    "postText": "Hello! This post probably seems silly to a lot of you who are most likely a lot more seasoned in entrepreneurship than I am!! But we all have to start somewhere right \ud83e\udd23 \n\nI\u2019ve been brainstorming a social platform idea for a few weeks now/ I have everything written down as to what I\u2019d like specifically on the site. If someone with any knowledge on how I could put this project into fruition I\u2019d appreciate it. Keep in mind I\u2019m a total noob, but a noob with a lot of great ideas. \nHere what I assume I will need to begin: \nA programmer/developer to create &amp; design the platform itself-  in a full website and app format \n\nI posted a \u201chelp wanted\u201d on Upwork already with an outline of what I\u2019ll need- is there any other place that anyone recommends for me to hire a creator? \n\nAlso, do I need to get any sort of certification to release the platform? I\u2019m in NY (not the city) do I need a business license? Will I need to put a trademark on the business so no one can steal the idea when it\u2019s finally complete? Do I need to hire a lawyer for privacy/security info for the users? Any and all feedback or recommendations will be so so greatly appreciated. \n\nI\u2019m a single mom/ I\u2019ve always been super inventive since I was young, it was one of my dreams as a little girl to actually become an inventor. \nI also want to provide a better life for me and my daughter, I\u2019d love to see something I\u2019ve created in my mind come to life and be successful. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this!",

Also you will have hosting costs for running the servers / databases and any other tech needed. \n\nYour biggest challenge is getting content. You need to reach a point where you have enough content to attract users and get sustained growth. \n\nInfo security for the users is something you can handle by just understanding the regulations about how you use the data. You don\u2019t need a lawyer usually. \n\nI\u2019d recommend trademarking anything and getting yourself protected but that\u2019s probably the least of your challenges with something like this. If you want to discuss the technical things I\u2019m a dev and can offer rough advice etc",

It would be basic profile info with basic features. User to User Interaction is minimal as well . It\u2019s a maximum of 10% of what a platform like Facebook would be. Very clean-cut and simple \n\nCan you please give me an example of the content you mentioned??\n\nAlso Thankyou for the response and the help!!!",

Hire a designer. \n\nNo one is going to be able to tell you with any certitude how much this will cost. There\u2019s a cost to build and ongoing costs to keep it running. \n\nTo get an idea, use $1000 app screen. \n\nYou will need backend servers, databases and other infrastructure on a platform like digital ocean, Google cloud, azure or aws.",

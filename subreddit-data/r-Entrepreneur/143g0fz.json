    "postText": "I will try to keep is as short and simple as possible:\n\nLaunched my startup 1 month ago - \nWe are a platform that provides guides in form of eBooks for a specific topic.  These guides are provided by content creators and we take a small margin.\n\nSent out the cold mail and responses were about 10-15% and 90% positive.\nFollowing mail got 20% positive feedback.\n\nI managed to get the biggest creator for our topic in my country and his management on a call and they were super excited about the opportunity. They didn\u2019t want to be the first ones to create a guide for our platform since it\u2019s a bit time consuming. So we adjusted and created a pre-made draft via canva until we have enough money to include it in the backend of our website. We agreed to talk by the end of the year again and if enough creators joined he would be more than happy to join too.\n\nSeems like this is the same problem for every creator no matter how big or small - they don\u2019t want to do the work (approx 10h to finish one) but instead want to get payed beforehand even though we work with commissions.\n\nI\u2019ve also sent out 3 contracts so far but two didn\u2019t even reply afterwards. Our contracts are short, easy to understand and have no hidden stuff.\n\nOur competitors are only two, both funded but doing a bad job at marketing since almost nobody knows about them and uses them.\n\nI focus on creators with 10k+ on Instagram or Tiktok, should I lower this to attract more creators?\n\nFurthermore I would like to get help on how I can convince people even more that it\u2019s worth taking the small risk since they can make a good amount of money trough selling on our website. \nAny advice is more than welcome, thank you!:)",

Secondly IMO those platforms when 2 things come together. Marketability and ease of use. \n\nI would suggest free trials and or free collaborations so you can build your stock and get testimonials. You have to look at it as a regular business they don\u2019t turn profit immediately. \n\nIf you want to be the etsy of courses you need to be known to have quality course on hand for the consumer and market share and ease of use for the sellers. Thats what drives people to ebay etsy etc its it will be easy to sell. So first build stock then build an audience. It won\u2019t be easy and you won\u2019t make money immediately.",

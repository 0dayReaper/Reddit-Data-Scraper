    "postText": "Hey guys! So i've got a 5 room( around 147m2) apartment as an inheritance. It is on a first floor of a residential building. It has it's own door so it can be used for commercial means. I live in a east asian country and the apartment has a poor parking space but is beside a busy road. There are 2 schools and 3 university buildings withing its 1km radius. But i think it can't be used as a cafe or a restaurant since it doesn't have a good parking space and the tenants would dislike it if there is a lot of traffic beside the building. I am thinking of maybe opening a kindergarten or a salon. What are your thoughts on this? Would love some feedback",

Overall I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I work in supply chain mgmt professionally, so that\u2019s just my take. You\u2019d be better off funneling traffick to other people\u2019s items on Amazon frankly",

FBA, just for me, seems like a ton of work for a proportionally lower return on your of work and dollar invested. \n\nWould it be possible to subcontract some of your friends work, or start by taking the \u201cbitch work\u201d. I don\u2019t mean that disparagingly, but as a way to start building those business relations and to be able to learn how the sausage is made, so to speak",

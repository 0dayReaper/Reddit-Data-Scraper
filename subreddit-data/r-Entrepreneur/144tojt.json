    "postText": "Hey everyone,As a founder with ADHD, I struggled to maintain consistency in various aspects of my life. This appeared in these bad habits:\n\n* Struggling to start due to procrastination &amp; perfectionism\n* Breaking habits shortly after starting them\n* Not being capable of bouncing back after a vacation or lull period\n\nHowever, over the past couple of years, I have successfully built new habits, overcome my challenges, and developed consistency. Here are my experiences and learnings.\n\n# Anything can become a habit!\n\nDuring my journey to develop better habits, I discovered negative behaviors that formed into habits. For example, whenever I felt stuck, my instinct was to reach for my phone. This often led me to get lost in social media or endless text messages, forming a detrimental habit. Reflecting on my day-to-day routines, I often operated on autopilot, lacking intentionality. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Waking up and spending an hour scrolling through my phone.\n2. Brushing my teeth in the same rushed manner, earning a scolding at the dentist's office.\n3. Closing YouTube, checking my messages, and then mindlessly returning to YouTube.\n4. Avoiding or postponing challenging tasks when faced with difficulties.These habits developed unconsciously throughout my life. James Clear, the author of Atomic Habits, says, \u201c Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\u201d Throughout my life, I unknowingly accumulated votes that I regret. However, there are a couple of key habits that allowed me to accumulate votes to generate momentum.\n\n# How I Fostered Consistency\n\nJames Clear's book \"Atomic Habits\" provided valuable insights into habit formation. Here are the core steps of habit formation:\n\n1. Trigger: A cue or reminder that prompts the habit.\n2. Desire: A craving or motivation for the reward to complete the habit.\n3. Response: The action or behavior that forms the habit.\n4. Reward: The positive outcome or satisfaction obtained upon completing the habit.\n\nBy understanding these steps, we can effectively break harmful habits and establish new ones. Now, let's focus on the habits I used to break unproductive habits and foster consistency.\n\n1. Getting Started: Procrastination often leads to delayed or unfinished tasks. To tackle this, I had to break the habit of procrastinating and perfectionism consciously. Starting with small, manageable tasks can build momentum and make it easier to maintain consistency. Now when I want to start something, I do it that day.\n2. Sustaining Interest: Maintaining interest in a habit was challenging. To address this, I set smaller milestones that move me closer to my goal. By slowly introducing more challenges and forcing myself to grow, I kept it engaging and prevented monotony. For example, when I\u2019m at the gym, I\u2019m always reaching for a new goal.\n3. Embracing Change Gradually: Our minds naturally resist change, making it difficult to adjust habits. To counteract this, I formed the habit of embracing incremental positive changes. By gradually introducing new practices and allowing myself time to adapt, I found it easier to integrate lasting changes into my daily life. Instead of committing to a drastic change like a diet, commit to eating healthier and become a health nut.\n4. Bouncing Back from Lulls and Lack of Motivation: Consistency is not about never faltering but rather the ability to recover after setbacks. I developed the skill of getting back on track after periods of low motivation, vacations, or disruptions\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEvery day, I generate hundreds of votes, so it\u2019s extremely important to make those votes for the person I want to be. If not, I\u2019ll become the person based on my short-term desires. I started by assessing my routines, identifying my negative habits, and slowly making changes until I developed the desired habits. If I\u2019m not forming good habits, I\u2019m forming bad ones. Use your time to become the person you want to be!",

Opportunities that you much rather would have wanted in your life than not. Get off the damn phone scrolling, if that's one thing I could tell younger people to becoming closer to their goals, it would be that.",

Honestly, I read up till your third bullet point and then I jump to comment and I will save this to read later and now I\u2019m just stuck with 90,000 things to read or catch up on . I am an opportunist so I went from crypto to launch an NFT project which raised I think a little over 2 million. Now I see AI as the next shiny coin and have seven projects that are about 21% done scattered all over the place with different teams and different computers. I thought that getting a couple of assistance would help, but I have a lack of direction , grit , and any other adjective you want to put in there to even do anything for myself \u2013 what makes me think that I could handle a team of three people who are paid while I haven\u2019t done anything in couple of months. I\u2019d like to just throw money at things, hoping that it somehow fix the route issue, which is me. \n\nIf I just had x then I could do y. I\u2019ve employed various strategies from tiny little steps and progressing to negative reinforcement/positive reinforcement/reward systems and by the time it comes to the actual work and consistency by day three or four, I\u2019ve slowly reverted back to my old habits. I\u2019ve offered to pay community members to move to my country all expenses paid for six months. Offered a deadgod to anyone who can get me to do 4 things. \n\nSleep\nEat\nGym\n\nBRB had to go to IG to find out the 4 things I should do (video my sis sent me who suffers from similar issues)\n\nAhhh yes \u2026drink water \u2026yup that\u2019s the info I spent 4 min on to scroll through sis\u2019 convo to come say. There are some great moments, though a two-year gym have it with a six pack and great numbers \u2014 bmi, cholesterol and sugar - basically the credit score of me.  Mental health was very stable and great relationship with friends and family. Granted I was also less financially stable . \n\nAnd this was about maybe two years ago and now I am prediabetic with a fatty liver, a kidney stone  , also just got hacked and\u2026.\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this , part of me knows this is just the same thing I always do. I acknowledge some of the issues even spent a crap load of time and resources on a loosely defined plan that is constantly changing depending on what information I\u2019m looking at. \n\nI can\u2019t count how many before pictures I have taken in the bathroom thinking that I will get an amazing body in 38 days  - do you know how many half eaten Costco chicken breast bags I have?  Having  lingering feelings of being lost, overwhelmed and (insert adjective) . \n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019m taking a little bit of time to kind of reflect on what worked in the past and how I stopped doing what worked because I thought I was \u201cgood\u201d let\u2019s ride this high and start a company",

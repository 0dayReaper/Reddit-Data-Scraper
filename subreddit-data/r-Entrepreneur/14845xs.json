    "postText": "Hey all -\n\nHoping you can help - about a year ago, I started a professional service company and bought the www.companyname.io domain because the www.companyname.com was bought and parked.\n\nNow, 18 months in, we\u2019re at $500k+ in rev with very healthy profitability.\n\nI\u2019m about to start investing in marketing and driving traffic to the website, but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth buying the www.companyname.com before doing so? \n\nSeller/current owner wants $10k for the domain - just struggling with the decision.\n\nIs the .com worth it? Any advantages with SEO or marketing?\n\nThanks for any help!",

Secondly, it kind of sends signal that the companyname is yours, so others should find another name.\n\nI don't think there is much from SEO or marketing. However, I suggest to keep the .io and route the visitors to .com later on.",

If you're \"Patty's Consulting\" maybe you can get [www.pattycares.com](https://www.stacycares.com) for example. Can't help more without knowing your name to give examples. \n\nalso, check \"estibot\" to get a free value of the domain. if the value on there is close to the 10K then consider it.",

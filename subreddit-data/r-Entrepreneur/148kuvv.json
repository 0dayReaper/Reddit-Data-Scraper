    "postText": "Currently, I am a college student with a summer job and I have so much free time on my hands this summer.\n\nInstead of tackling, one of many business ideas I thought of, I always get overly-excited in the brainstorming phase. But NEVER execute or actually start. I just end up playing video-games or watching videos (or anything but starting the business).\n\nIs it true that  if you \"do something you enjoy and you will never have to worry about motivation\"? Or am I just being a lazy sack of sh\\*t?\n\nOverall, I cannot tell if I'm trying to start a business I'm not passionate about or if I'm just lazy.\n\nSorry if this a confusing post, anyone kind of input would be appericated.

This can get the ball rolling and increase motivation because you started at least. If you stop after the one simple task then at least you got one thing done and you're a little closer to your goal but depending on your personality traits, I've found a lot of business owners I mentor get started and keep going.",

Take on something to help your community that can also help you in your future. There's lots of things you can do and learn in the interim that will prepare you for Entrepreneurship, once the time is right.\n\nNot saying you shouldn't start a side hustle or something, just saying don't beat yourself up over it too much if you don't, as that's not very productive.",

And then the other part is, things take work, and sometimes it is a lot of work. Prioritizing your time is important. And it looks like to you, you'd rather prioritize doing something else other than business. Which is totally okay. Life has way to much of this hustle and work 24/7 culture imo. You already bust your ass off at school, it is okay to relax. \n\nThat being said, it does take dedication and a ton of work to start a business. It just takes something that is worth it to you. That is usually a passion, but you don't need a burning desire to eat breath sleep dream about this thing to build a successful business. \n\nLove your life and enjoy what you do! There is plenty of time to work and start a business in life. It'll happen when you are ready for it to happen.",

Just getting in the habit of working on it at all gets you halfway there. The first baby step I'd do is just writing out what your next steps are and when you'll do them. Having a plan in place and doing even a small amount of work on it daily inches you closer to your goal until you start working on it automatically out of habit",

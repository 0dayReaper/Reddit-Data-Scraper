    "postText": "Me and my friend  have been working as a website development agency for very small businesses for a very cheap price(approx 50-70$ including hosting and domain). The purpose was to help every small business to have a digital presence. We were making a profit of around 35-45$ per site. (I am from India so that is around 3-4k INR)\n\nSince this was very low, we had to make atleast 3-4 sites in a day for this all to make sense. So we made a in-house website builder which basically allowed us to make and deploy websites in 20-30min. \n\nNow, I feel we have hit a point where we can't make more than a certain amount in a month. Do you think  hiring new folks for development/sales would be a good idea for scaling, or should we move towards a product approach and try to make the website builder a self serve for everyone.\n\nOr does neither sounds like a good idea and we should start approaching bigger clients in order to scale.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you need to streamline processes somewhere, or change your approach to the model. \n\nWhether or not you scale basically depends on how you acquire customers; if you\u2019re slow to acquire, then hiring somebody else who can shit out websites at Godspeed rates won\u2019t do any good. \n\nThough; if you\u2019ve got an in-house website editor that allows people to build websites and deploy them in 30 minutes; why not put it up as a SAAS for businesses instead? \n\nIf you can make your UI intuitive enough for non-techies to be able to build a solid website, you can advertise it on a monthly service, allowing you to focus more time and resources elsewhere while still achieving your vision of helping every business get a digital presence",

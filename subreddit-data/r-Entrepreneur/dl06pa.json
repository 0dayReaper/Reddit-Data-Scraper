    "postText": "The headline is more to grab your attention than to brag because the rest of this post is not going to be nearly as sexy. I wanted to write this post for people who are struggling to make their first $1,000 or $5,000 - I want to give you an inside look to how I did this, not overnight, but what the ugly, drawn-out process looked like for me.\n\nThere's no get-rich-quick tips here. There's no \"hacks.\" No \"shortcuts.\" I'm a very unlucky person who feels very lucky to be able to make this amount from my laptop at home while dealing with my endless medical issues.\n\n# Background information about the business:\n\n* **Name/URL:** It's my username. I probably don't even show up on Google - also, I don't have social media outside of Reddit so there isn't much to look at. P.S. Not a self-promo, I'm booked out and not looking for more work.\n* **Type of business:** \"Virtual assistance\" - basically, if someone needs an extra hand to do it in their business, I probably do it. My limitations are code/development and design. I am horrendous in those areas.\n* **Business model:** People pay me a flat fee of $1000/month to be their virtual assistant for a flat fee of $600/month to write 4 pieces of content for them (email or blog only). *Note: I don't do hourly fees because I work quickly. I am not going to work for $15 because I did it in 1 hour when someone would do the same work in 2 hours and make $30?* When I break it down (I track my hours using Toggl) it's roughly $45-$100/hour per client, monthly.\n* **Open since:** Officially? August 2019. When I started virtual assistance? 2010 - which leads me to the rest of this post.\n\n# Tidbit about me for context:\n\n* I'm in my super late 20's.\n* Single mom, 2 young kids - one isn't in school yet.\n* Clinically diagnosed schizo-bipolar, BPD, and PTSD - this is important because I believe this is why it took me so long to get here.\n* College dropout with 1.4 GPA. (Criminal Justice)\n* Only \"legitimate\" job was USMC, of which I only did 1 term as a glorified dispatcher.\n* Based in the USA. I don't live in a huge city and rent for 3 bedrooms is $900 where I live, to give you context about my choices for pricing.\n\n# Starting Expenses:\n\n* MacBook Air: $800 (bought it on Black Friday in 2016, returned by original buyer)\n* Mouse: $20\n* iPhone 6s: $650 (bought it in 2016, completely paid off)\n* Squarespace Domain: $20/year\n* Squarespace Business hosting + SSL certificate: $216\n* Logo: $29 (hired a friend to do it)\n* Canva for Business: $12.95/month\n* LLC set-up + misc. legal stuff: $150 (used ZenBusiness - no affiliation)\n* Upwork: $5? Maybe? (You have to pay to bid on jobs)\n\n# How I Hit $5,000/Month + All The Mistakes Made:\n\nI didn't really know what a virtual assistant was or how long I had been doing it. I was roughly 18-19 years old, homeless (couch surfing), and needed money fast.\n\nI looked at Craigslist's \"odd jobs.\" Found a job from a now popular porn site that paid people $35/hour with a $250 bonus, to label like 800 porn videos in 1 week. I was making about $1,000/week doing this but being young and naive, spent it all at once thinking that this money would always be there.\n\n*Then they outsourced to India and every American lost their job.*\n\n**Mistake #1: I put all my eggs in one basket.**\n\nFrom here, I continued to make this mistake. I made a good amount off of Fiverr, only to get my account closed because a client complained about something I don't recall doing (I rather not call her a liar). If it's on r/WorkOnline and doesn't require a degree, I've probably been there, done that, and continued to put all my eggs in one basket until I burned myself out.\n\n**Mistake #2: Lack of self-care/sleep because I wanted to \"grind/hustle\" = Burn out = Declining mental health = Poor sleep habits = Poor eating habits = Poor hygiene habits = Health problems = etc.**\n\nThis phase of my life was a blur, but a very important blur because here, I was trial and error-ing different things I could do. I was blogging. I was messing around on Twitter with tools like HootSuite and MeetEdgar. I made websites on Wordpress and Wix and Blogger. I took $5/hour r/slavelabour-style jobs because it's all I was qualified to do.\n\nIf I didn't know how to do it, I didn't let the client know. I Googled and spent hours on the forgotten corners of internet forums and Reddit, hoping to find the answer to a hopeless problem.\n\nI didn't sleep much or slept too much. My mental health went ignored. I literally started hallucinating and having meltdowns, which eventually led to my divorce, which will be more relevant later on.\n\n**Mistake #3: I widely underestimated what people were willing to throw money at.**\n\nEventually, I learned what a \"virtual assistant\" was and called myself that. I also learned that a lot of people will pay you to do simple things they can't be arsed to do themselves - like upload a blog post, write an email, or do customer support. Or label porn.\n\nThink of a virtual assistant as a virtual \"nanny\" or \"nurse\" who does everything for the business/entrepreneur so the business/entrepreneur can focus on making money.\n\n(You're probably wondering where I found my clients. Upwork. Craigslist. Seriously.)\n\nBy this time, I was making about $1,000/month - which is barely enough to live on. I apply for food stamps to eat, at this point.\n\nI slogged like this for a few more years, until my ex-husband had a mid-life crisis. He kicked me and the kids out.\n\n**Mistake #4: Being comfortable. Not having a savings/emergency fund.**\n\nMy credit score sucks due to poor money decisions (don't worry, I'm subscribed to r/personalfinance and r/leanfire now to learn money handling skills) so I couldn't take out a loan to move. My Discord friends and 3 IRL friends (I don't have family, it's just me) loaned me about $500 altogether. I told all of my clients what was happening - partially so they could find a replacement or expect me to go MIA.\n\nTo my surprise, ALL OF THEM, immediately asked, \"How can I help?\" One of my clients gave me a $500 advance on our retainer and contracted me to set up a Squarespace website for another $500. Another client put together a PDF of resources for single mothers and government assistance.\n\nI spent every penny I made as a virtual assistant, on this move.\n\nThere is something life shaking about being homeless and alone (which I was when I started this journey). There's something terrifying about the idea of being homeless and alone - especially when children are involved.\n\n*This is the turning point that lit a fire under my ass.*\n\nI set a goal to hit $5,000/month by December 2019 - 3 virtual assistance clients at $1,000/month a pop and 4 writing clients at $600/month. I also take side projects that are non-retainer.\n\nProblem? I was very fucking alone.\n\n**Mistake #5: Underestimating the power of people. Being a dick. Thinking I knew better. Shitting on coaches and guru's that I've never met.**\n\nHere was my strategy, since I don't have friends, ad spend money, or time:\n\n* Think of all current clients and clients from the last 6 months who have money and never had issues paying me. Pitch them the $1000/month idea. (Only one, of 10, converted, BUT THAT'S 1/3 SECURED).\n* Make Facebook account\n* Join 20 Facebook groups per day. Filter them. Add the top 10 (engagement and where my potential clients are) pinned to shortcuts.\n* Add 500 friends/day who are potential leads.\n* Make a website with a landing page for my business.\n* Make people laugh. (Yeah, seriously. Entrepreneurship is so stuffy and stuck up sometimes, I needed a way to catch people's attention).\n* Help people and don't pitch. (Because it's 2019 and everyone is pitching and when you don't pitch, people wonder who the hell you are and look at your profile, where you can conveniently leave your URL)\n* My flat fee is $1,000/month. I will not take a dollar less. It's $500 upfront to secure me and I do not work until the next 2 weeks ($500/biweekly) is paid in full. I cannot chase non-paying clients.\n\nI don't have a \"page\" by the way. This is all my personal account. I did this religiously for 2 weeks and posted a lot of business-related memes. I shared stories about labeling porn. People laughed and told me they really liked my \"energy.\" They felt safe.\n\nI went into Facebook groups and answered peoples questions and calmed them down when they had business issues. \"My email marketing tool is not sending out my broadcasts\" \"I am not reaching over 10% open rate in my emails.\" All those years of Googling and slogging away paid off.\n\nWhere do coaches and gurus come in? **They have an audience.** I learned that they are not necessarily going to make you rich but they are a pay to play model. I joined some girl-power group led by a guru ($15/month) and bought myself into her audience. I told her straight up, \"Look, I'm trying to book out and this is what I do. Here's my website.\" She blasted my info to her audience. I ate a slice of humble pie and stopped doing the shit-on-coaches crap.\n\nMy funny memes? People *shared* them.\n\nEvery time someone offered \"free coaching calls\" I took them up on it. I wrote glowing reviews, which they SHARED. **For the last month, people in these circles constantly saw my name and face.** If these coaches and gurus with thousands of followers were vouching for me, I am trustworthy, and if I am trustworthy, my website is worth looking at.\n\nThe rest was a waiting game. If people emailed me, I emailed back within 6 hours. If they inquired about me on Facebook messenger, I messaged back the same day.\n\nPeople booked calls with me and talked to me. I had to talk to a lot of people before someone finally said yes, but who the fuck cares. THEY SAID YES.\n\nThis weekend, I booked out. I had to decline two people this morning because I just don't have time for more clients. I put them on a waitlist. But now I've secured $5,000/month minimum on retainer clients and I'm building my waitlist.\n\nAlso, paid all my friends back.\n\nBut, this brings me to my latest mistake:\n\n**Mistake #6: No source of passive income and capping income.**\n\nI've capped myself at $5,000/month :( So... what the hell do I do now?\n\nI'm going to create a source of passive income which I won't talk about here so it doesn't become a pitch. I'll attempt to scale it to $5,000/month. After that, I'm going to convert my virtual assistance clients to digital marketing clients and work on commission so my income ceiling is higher. I've never made more than $5,000/month so I don't know what I don't know and I intend to continue making mistakes along the way.\n\nAlso, this subreddit hates coaches, but the majority of my clients are coaches. Best part? **They have money.** I plan on hiring one who offered me a very valuable free coaching call a few weeks ago.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nI spent a lot of time learning random skill sets and then learned people will hire me for the skill set. Spent years doubting myself and undercharging. Ex kicked me and the kids out. I panicked. Set up a website. Mass networked on Facebook. Did a shit-ton of free calls to get free business tips from guru's. Bought into low-entry groups for more visibility. Made people laugh. Did even more shit-tons of \"discovery calls\" for potential clients. Answered a lot of emails and inquiries. Asked. For. Help.\n\nAnd there you have it. None of this was glamorous or sexy, and I took almost a decade to get to $5,000/month but every journey starts somewhere, right?\n\nHope this was helpful to *someone* out there. Have a good one.\n\n# FAQ Edit:\n\nHey, wow, thanks for the response. My email, DM's, inbox, and the comment thread here is pretty flooded but I'll try to answer as many questions as possible in between my breaks.\n\n**The best way to get ahold of me is through email or commenting, I can't quite figure out how to thread Reddit messages to maintain context :/** (If someone has a better system for organizing the inbox stuff, let me know)\n\nTo make your lives easier, let me answer some FAQ. **Please note that I am not an affiliate or endorsing any of the links I post - it's just stuff I found useful. Hire/buy at your own risk.**\n\n**----**\n\n**I want that dropshipping resource. Send it to me?**\n\nRead this guide by 7FS: [https://files.convertkitcdnn.com/assets/documents/34674/2440142/350\\_\\_Niche\\_2019\\_-\\_FINAL.pdf](https://files.convertkitcdnn.com/assets/documents/34674/2440142/350__Niche_2019_-_FINAL.pdf).\n\nI do not endorse them and their customer reviews are garbage so hire them at your own risk. However, their strategy on researching luxury/high-ticket niches is solid. If you skip this step or fudge it (researching 2-3 niches instead of the recommended 50) and you're wondering why your store failed, well... there you go. Also covers how to work with suppliers and such.\n\n**How do you manage the kids while being a single mom?**\n\nI work with them instead of against them. My kids are monsters after 12pm (as most kids are due to being overstimulated and tired). I get up at 5am and get the bulk of my work done before 11am. My 1st grader is in school, 3 year old watches tv and eats breakfast (which I cook in bulk so I can microwave it quickly). By noon, I'm tired, my kids want my attention, and I can't slog through work if they need me so I do household chores, cook, spend time with them, during this time. They're in bed at 6:30pm and I spend the evening doing self-care, taking courses on Skillshare, reading, etc.\n\n**Are you hiring/subcontracting? Are you taking mentees?**\n\nYes and no. First off, I only work with USA-based subcontractors and mentees because I can't begin to understand the cultural impact and obstacles that comes with being an overseas contractor. Second, I'm looking for a very specific type of subcontractor - they've already VA'd for several businesses and have an interest in problem-solving (a core skill every contractor needs). I'm currently not mentoring but would highly recommend:\n\n* Check out your local SCORE for free mentors: [https://score.org/mentor-match](https://www.score.org/mentor-match)\n* Getting an accountability buddy in r/accountabilitybuddies\n* Work exchange with a coach. I did this a few times. I offered unpaid VA work in exchange for a coaching call. This also lead to paid clients in the past because coaches = big network/influence.\n\n**Are you saying we should use your strategy \"shotgun\" method on Facebook?**\n\nAbsolutely not. You should determine where your audience is, figure out how they respond, and design your marketing strategy to put yourself on their radar. The Facebook strategy worked for me because it's specific to my target audience. You have to reverse engineer a strategy for your audience. This requires a lot of trial by fire, by the way. You probably won't figure it out the first dozen times you try. Remember, you're reading my TLDR. I didn't get into all the different crap I tried that didn't work (like trying to run a Facebook ad and paid $60 for a lead.)\n\n**Do you have any recommended resources/books/guides?**\n\nSure.\n\n* r/Stoicism subreddit. Getting my mind right was a huge stepping stone for me. Stop whining. Stop complaining. Stop making excuses. Stop keeling over when things suck. Stop idolizing people. Stop caring when people talk shit or praise you. Be in the moment, work, help other people succeed, rinse, repeat.\n* Don't buy a course. Get Skillshare and learn what you need to learn for much cheaper: [https://www.skillshare.com/home](https://www.skillshare.com/home)\n* Read. Get a subscription on Scribd: [https://www.scribd.com/](https://www.scribd.com/)\n* Learn copywriting. It'll help you write emails, websites, content, sales pitches - it is the most crucial skill to being able to sell, in my opinion. My favorite resource for copywriting (if you're a designer, warning, you WILL throw up at the design): [https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/](https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/) (You don't need to buy his course but if you do, he does \"tear downs\" which was really valuable to me.)\n\n**Can you help me? Can you refer clients to me? Can you help me make money?**\n\nWell, tell me what you've done to help yourself, first. If you message me but you don't know what type of work you want to do, what kind of clients you want to work with, or made a lot of attempts and failures already, you have to get your feet wet. I'm not saying that to be a dick, you only know what works and what doesn't by *doing it.* You also have to be able to define a measurable way to track your success/lack of. **If you've already jumped in the trenches and it's not working, sure, we can shoot some ideas back and forth**. If you're hoping I just hand you a strategy or trust a random Redditor with my referrals, I'm sorry, but that won't help you. There is a difference between being handed the answer key to a test and working hard to understand the material for an exam. One will build you a solid foundation, the other will sustain you for a week and then you'll be back to square one because you didn't learn anything. \n\n(Will continue updating and answering questions between work).",

You just gotta learn from them, even if you don't learn that lesson immediately. You're watching everyone's highlights and reels on Instagram/Reddit/etc. because everyone wants to show you their best face, not their warts. You're not alone, even if it feels that way.  \n\n\n&gt;um...... label porn? That one statement really confused me.\n\n**Label porn-** My first job was writing things like \"Hot blonde MILF seduces innocent stepson\" on porn videos. $35/hour. It didn't last more than a few months, but it paid really well. I don't think these jobs exist much anymore because nowadays a lot of people upload their own videos and do their own title/tags. Haven't been in that part of the industry in a while so I'm not up to date on that.  \n\n\n&gt;how did you come up with your business strategy?\n\n**My strategy**\\- Reverse engineer. Here's how it went:\n\n* **What is the job?** Virtual assistance with a focus on content, copywriting, email marketing, customer support, and/or SaaS management (Convertkit, Zapier, etc.)\n* **Who is the target market?** Online business owners who make at least $8,000 per month and need an intermediate-expert level assistant to manage their business.\n* **Where can they be found?** LinkedIn, Facebook, different podcasts, guest posting for Forbes, Inc, etc.\n\nFrom there, the most accessible to me is Facebook and I knew Facebook best so that's why I went with joining Facebook groups and getting visible there. A lot of business owners in my target market still use Facebook because *their* customers are there. I had to get on their radar, fast, so that's why I went with this.\n\nI slapped a website together only because a lot of them asked for a website. It originally wasn't part of the plan - but when you identify a weak point, you *pivot*. Revise.\n\n**Note: I'm not encouraging anyone else to do this. You MUST know what you want to do, who you are targeting, how to find them, and how to sell to them.** For me, that meant Facebook sprints. For you, it could be pitching on LinkedIn, walking up to a store IRL and pitching, putting out Facebook ads, I don't know. Every business, audience, and goal works differently.  \n\n\n&gt;Did you research a lot before you started, or was it based on learning from your failures?\n\nLearning from failures. My life kinda looked like this:\n\n* Oh great idea.\n* Wow, not so great.\n* This is terrible.\n* I'm crying now. \n* Start over, but with more experience.\n* New great idea.\n* Wow, not so great.\n* Well, this did okay.\n* I need more money, this isn't working.\n* Okay, we have more experience. Let's try something else.\n\nIt's like playing a video game. At first, you won't be perfect. You need to learn mechanics, character build, etc. etc. Eventually you modify and build a character you enjoy and refine your gaming style.\n\nHope that helps!",

This typically works great for smaller businesses (&lt;10 people) who don\u2019t have a full time person or marketing department. I end up much cheaper than bringing someone on full time. \n\nI handle: social media, SEO, graphic design, email marketing, website maintenance, content marketing, FB/PPC ads, sometimes a bit of partnerships and outreach. We agree on parameters for these deliverables (for example, 1 print design, 4 emails a month, 4 social posts a week etc.) before we begin working together. They\u2019re not unlimited. \n\nI ask that my clients provide me with everything I need at the start of each month. I set up a shared Google Drive with relevant folders where they can upload things. From there, it\u2019s relatively straightforward for me to create the content and schedule/automate everything ahead of time. I might take a day to do that for each client. This way I then have space day to day if a client needs something last minute. \n\nOccasionally, I\u2019ll get a couple of clients needing something quickly at the same time and I might work an extra long day to get everything completed but as long as I stay organised with the base tasks, it doesn\u2019t impact on me much, and doesn\u2019t happen too often anyway. There are some days where I only work about an hour so it balances itself out. Hope that helps!",

I write a sequence of emails, THEY set up the campaign, etc.) \n- I will handle copywriting and content creation (my strengths), consulting, direct management of clients, and project manager. One day, I'd love to hand off project management but I'm not ready to envision what that life will look like.\n\nThis month I put out applications for a part-time subcontractor with strong design skills. Will be interviewing all October and then I am hoping they will translate to moving them into a more defined design role and giving the implementation workload to another subcontractor. \n\nI will eventually pitch consultation work to my clients. I'll work for the $1000/month but I want creative flexibility over marketing aspects (which I do handle even as a virtual assistant. I'm very hands on with customer support, writing content, handling email marketing, etc.) and a 10% commission. I've already tested this with one client and they we very happy with the outcome.\n\nSo, my model is shifting and going through growing pains. Im not sure what the other side will look like but I'll never know til I finally get there.\n\nAlso, I work remotely because people in my area have no idea wtf I do for a living, let alone that it exists. Applying for an apartment was hell because everyone was like \"self employed? so... you're a babysitter?\"",

He's been at it a little less than 2 years.\n\nWe do this:\n\n* He sets up events. I make him hit a goal of 1 event per week.\n* At the event, he has a box with lead cards - it asks for name, phone (do you prefer I text or call?), and a checkbox of all the insurances they're interested in. We also ask for best time we should contact them. **We don't cold call or send flyers. We only contact people who submit a lead card.**\n* Everyone who submits a lead card gets entered to win a $50 gift card or runner up get $10 gift card. This encourages people to sign up. He draws at the end of the event.\n* That evening or the day, **I** (this is important) call or text using a local phone number (Google Skype) and ask them when's the best time to set up a meeting. I schedule them in [AcuityScheduling](https://www.acuityscheduling.com) which fires off an automated email confirming the call, with an option to reschedule at their leisure. If not a call, I text them a quick follow-up text with a link to my SO's Acuity calendar so they can self-schedule. This is how you tackle people who are too introverted/busy to get on the phone to schedule (they can self-checkout essentially) and keep people who rather you do it for them. **I do the calls instead of him because in our experience, a quiet, friendly female voice converts better than his deeper male voice.** We've experimented and the soft female voice makes enough of a difference to add 3-5 extra appointments per week.\n* He then does his thing and sells.\n\nMost importantly, and I see this across all industries, don't go for the \"I'm the cheapest\" angle. He was not securing sales because he couldn't compete with USAA and Progressive. I encouraged him to take the \"I will take care of you\" angle which helped - \"We're not the cheapest, but I will personally come meet you on your lunch break, file the claim with you if needed, and look over everything on your behalf to save you the headache.\" What do people love more than penny-pinching? Being taken care of and knowing every penny went to something they get a return on. \n\nPlus, this is scalable because even if *you* can't personally do it anymore because you are too busy making money, you can hire an assistant to help you take care of your customers :) Easy day.",

Scared of bad reviews.\n\nIf I've learned anything, after the first dozen times a client yells at you (you also learn it's not always your fault), you get fired, you get cursed out, a peer claims you stole their idea (like really, people will claim you stole the most ridiculous things like 'I was the first to think of using an automated calendar system!'), your launch fails, you're broke, you need to get another job temporarily, you cry into your pizza and shower, you have someone who says your writing sucks, your questions/ideas/posts get shit on all over Reddit, you see someone who is doing what you want to be doing which makes you feel terrible, you get your money stolen by a shitty guru (though good ones exist), you skip meals because you're hungry...  \n\n\nYou get used to it. The journey sucks. Failing sucks. Making mistakes suck. It all sucks.  \n\n\nKeep going anyway. Yeah, you're a regular person. So is everyone else who set out to be an entrepreneur. We are all so fucking average and ordinary... the only difference is that some people get back up, some stay down. You will never know if you were one more mistake from \"greatness\" if you decide that you want to stay down. (P.S. There's no shame in getting another job or going part-time to fund your entrepreneurial dreams.)  \n\n\nAlso, if you suck at eCommerce but you love it, keep doing it. Revise your strategy. Keep failing, keep revising, keep at it until something sticks. If you start hating eCommerce then pivot. Because hey, you had to learn how to research products. Read analytics. Copywrite for your products. So even if you walk away with no money to show for your efforts, you just became that much more talented in several skill sets that will make your next business venture easier.",

It's definitely great for a creative website but as a professional business service are the templates what you would want? \n\nAlso great advice with the Facebook groups.

In fact, lots of people drivel things like \"Real businesses don't use Squarespace.\" \"You can't scale with Squarespace.\" I've personally worked for 3 multimillion-dollar businesses that exclusively use Squarespace. \n\nThe main reason I use Squarespace is that I'm not a developer or a designer. I'm a virtual assistant who doesn't have time to set up a \"professional looking site\" and can't justify dropping $800-$5000 on a professional design. Also, if people work cheaper than that, I have guilt about saying, \"Meh, I don't like it.\"\n\nI recommend looking at [Knapsack Creative's portfolio](https://knapsackcreative.com/work) if you are curious about what can be done with Squarespace. They have all different industries so you can see it's not limited to creatives.\n\nMy friend owns [The Smart Keep](http://thesmartkeep.com/) which is a bookkeeping business on Squarespace. At the end of the day, I don't love her website (because I'm not her target market) but she definitely pulls high-end clients with her services and website. You can kinda snoop around and check out what she does.\n\nYou'd highly benefit from Facebook groups. So many aspiring business owners completely ignore their finances and don't realize they have to pay taxes.",

Not to say it doesn't happen, but if you choose reputable plugins that have continuing support, then there will never be any issues. You have to look for plugins that have lots of installs, a good rating, and active support. In other words, WordPress itself is hardly ever to blame for issues - they have excellent backwards compatibility and fix known issues very quickly. It's the plugins that are the problem, which is why you should avoid using them whenever possible.",

Quit your job because you are making too much money making sales. If you are physically able to work, then work. That's INVESTMENT for your business! That's ad spend. That's a savings account.

Your workload may be capped, but maybe you can fit some of your own managerial duties in to your day-to-day. \n\nIf this interests you PM me and I'd love to chat about entrepreneurship. I do secretarial work and I know that it's a very flexible, important field that greatly helps out the people you work for.

Grow your business by hiring hiring people to work for you and going after more clients, etc.\n\nA couple of things on here strike me:\n\n\\- like 20???!! facebook groups?! I can barely deal with 2 or 3. Surely there must be some app or better way of dealing with FB groups than browser? FB is just such a clusterfuck jumble of crap, slow page responses, and random order and way too many notifications.\n\n\\- add 500 friends per day?? On facebook? Are you hoping these people just follow you using the shotgun approach? Cuz I get business \"followers\" on IG ALLL the time and almost NEVER follow them back (maybe less than .5%). Some of them I even report or block because they do this every damn day/week.\n\n\\- what is a \"girl power group\"? Is this some IG thing where you pay somebody with an audience for a shoutout or something else?",

They handle the quarterly taxes as well.\n\n(I got audited once several years ago. It's no joke. That's why I'm so willing to invest in a bookkeeper right off the bat).",

                    "comment": "I'm power hungry. That's the the goddamn honest truth. I grew up in a really fucked up situation and I lived in poverty most of my 20's. Mental health, bullying, substance abuse, etc. is the core of my young adult experiences.\n\nMoney = Power = Ability to make change. My goal is to set my kids up in a decent neighborhood, send them to Montessori school (my son has already been called racist shit and assaulted twice in school), hire a private nanny (especially for days my mental health falls apart - that way quality of parenthood never ceases). After that, I want to fund research for brain disease, fund counseling programs for \"troubled youth,\" find a way to pay dog trainers to retrain shelter animals to become emotional support animals (I honestly dont know if this is even possible, I'm not there yet), and fund extracurriculars for public schools (home ec, music, etc - these were cut when I was in school). \n\nThis stuff sounds kinda corny when I say it out loud, but I feel like the ultimate fuck you to school system and mental health system which I have a lot of grievances against, is to basically \"buy\" it and be the change I want to see. Talking about it, bitching about it, crying about it, and protesting, does nothing, but I've come to realize that almost anything can be bought for the right price. \n\nAnyway, virtual assistance was a fluke. I didn't know what this was called - data entry, etc. until someone online blogged about the term \"virtual assistance.\"\n\nI put a dropship link in the FAQ. The biggest thing, tbh, is to find 50 niches, research them well, research your competitors, and know that dropshipping is a pay to play field. Don't get started if you're broke and have no backup plan.",

This is an encouraging story. And despite what you say it is a sexy and beautiful story in a way. You know why? Because you persevered.  \nIf you have time to talk sometime message me. I could use some feedback and encouragement. And you seem like an amazing person to hear from.",

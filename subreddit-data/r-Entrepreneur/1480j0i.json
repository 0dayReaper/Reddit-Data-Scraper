    "postText": "So im currently 21 and both me and my fiance are looking to start our own businesses, both of which require semi unique buildings to run out of (She wants to open a Daycare and i want to open a Range/Gym combo) as for her she'd need a building with multiple rooms for separate age groups as well as a outdoor area to put up a playground for the kids to play in, as for me I'm looking at a 2 story building (One for Range and one for Gym) as well as showers and probably somewhere to cook/eat as well. Both of these buildings would be expencive to buy/ build and i obviously don't have multiple millions of dollars to shell out to get these properties.\nI'd assume there's a loan or something similar we could apply for to get the money to fund these projects either on a government or state level (we're in a major Texas city) and that we could apply for those and get these projects going even on a smaller level then what we're currently planning. Does anyone here have any recommendations of where i should look and what we should be expecting going into this for each of our prospective projects?\nWe've done the basics as far looking into what licenses we'll need to operate and having a plan as to basic operations once we've opened but that middle part of actually acquiring a location to operate out of is what's throwing us off and without knowing what we'd be paying monthly to have the location and whatnot else we can't properly budget this so as of right now there's a pretty important gaping hole in our plans/budgeting we're trying to fill.",

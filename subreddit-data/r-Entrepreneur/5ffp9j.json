    "postText": "**Thanks for the massive response on this everyone. I run a business during the day and wasn't really planning on this much feedback - I have tried to get back to everyone best as possible and will continue to do so as best as I can. Why am I sharing this? Steel sharpens steel. There isn no shortage of this work and many won't even try (thats not a dig). There are millions of websites and no matter how good they are now they need to be redone every few years anyway. A few will try though and as I scale up next year I would love to work with those who are as driven as I am. \n\nThose who doubt this money need to rethink what is possible. 10k+ is only one or two big websites a month. These figures are not that big in the larger scale of things but its only possible if you think it is. I was in the same place last year doubting I could even survive on web design but as I progressed I seen there is plenty of well paying work available. Again though its not easy and it is time consuming. None of this is meant to sound like I am preaching but rather just to confirm its possible. I hope to post on selling more tonight if possible. Thanks for reading so far** (tried to get this bold but couldn't?)\n\n\n\n\nHi Guys,\n\nI started a small web development company this year in January and I wanted to document my journey from making nothing for the first few months up to a steady income of over $10,000 a month. This isn\u2019t all profit as I will explain but it\u2019s been good so far and my best month was $17,000+.  Apologies for my rant-ish writing and hopefully some of you get some value out of this.\n\n*** This isn't some magic get rich formula but it is a great way to learn some useful skills and get paid decent money to help people\u2019s businesses. Also the profit and skills can be quickly used to start your own business. It takes a lot of work though and plenty of hours sitting at your computer \u2013 just want to be realistic from the start! ***\n\n\nBackstory:\nI used to work as a drilling engineer in Alberta, Canada (I am Irish) but when oil crashed I was let go pretty fast. I decided to travel in South America for a month, which I loved, but I had to go back to Canada and try find some more work. Even though I had made some good money in oil I spent it as fast as I made it and I was back to very little savings. I worked some odds jobs including moving furniture for an events company and other things. I got pretty sick of it and decided to risk it all and sell everything I owned non-essential and move back to South America. I moved just before Christmas last year and rented a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood. I slept on the ground on a mattress and basically had nothing but a desk, laptop and Wi-Fi connection. I had never successfully made money online before and I had no idea where to start. I tried Instagram marketing for a month and failure miserably. I did get some comments from Gary Vaynerchuk though which was cool. \n\nI ended up doing a Udemy course to build a website for a product I was working on. I actually really liked the website and I found coding kind of fun. I decided to give this a go and went to work. \n\nMonths 2-5:\nFirst stop was UpWork, which was brutal. I did about 3-4 months on here in total and it was pretty rough. I got some good clients but most were dicks and after some kid changed his mind for the 20th time on a $100 website I quit. I never made more than $200 and most websites took me two weeks to build (multiple changes, clients were slow, kept changing their mind). \n\nMonths 5-6:\nAfter that I decided to just start approaching people I knew and I did some websites for $200-500. They were mostly for small businesses that didn\u2019t have much cash flow and could not afford to pay me much. The websites were okay but they weren\u2019t getting great results for their owners so I didn\u2019t feel like I could charge much. \n\nMonths 6+:\n\nAt the time I was doing some legal work for Canada and the person I was working with had a terrible website. One day I asked her if she would want me to fix it (broken pages, terrible design) and she immediately said yes. She said she had been meaning to do it for years and badly needed it done. She said name my price. I picked the highest figure I could think of since I knew she had a very profitable business -$2,000!\n\nIt took me about 4 weeks to finish but I felt super happy about it. I spent a LOT of time on having it look great and making sure the images and copy (text) was perfect. When I gave it to her she loved it. Afterwards I asked her if she had gone with a real web design company what price would she have been happy to pay for the exact same website. Her answer\u2026 $5,000-6,000. Whoops. \n\nAfter this job I figured out a lot of what I had been doing wrong. I had been trying to get smaller companies to pay for websites that they would see very little ROI on. They would never be able to pay much because they just don\u2019t make much. Or they do make a bit but having a good website doesn\u2019t help them make more (good example is a gym - you just go to the nearest gym or the one someone recommends, a cool website won't help *too* much). \n\nI completely changed my strategy and started approaching larger companies that made a lot of money and were losing A LOT by having a terrible website. These are actually not too hard to find (if people want I can cover this is another post) and after a lot of cold calls and emails I started to get traction. I moved from $2,000 to $4,000 to $6,500 and after a few more up to $15,000. I read a lot on sales, marketing, design but I still only knew basic HTML and CSS. I would start off with a basic theme (around $30) and make a lot of changes to come up with a great design. \n\nNow I know people might be saying that isn\u2019t the best coding practice  (and it is not) but I added a lot of value in other areas and everyone was super happy with their websites. They are simple static designs (these owners don\u2019t want to edit anything again for a long time) but the results were really powerful. \n\n-\tOne business got a over 10 times increase in bookings (value 40-90k a month in future clients)\n-\tDirectly helped an oil company close a contract for over 1 million with a great new website (portfolio, downloadable brochure)\n-\tHelped a pro athlete increase his sponsors and also get more recognition\n\nThese are just a few examples but I am really happy with every one so far and my clients love to rave about the websites and the success. \n\nQuick recap:\n- I started with zero coding knowledge in January of this year. I didn't know how to host a website, I didn't know what HTML or CSS was, I made a tonne of really basic mistakes and figured it all out by myself. I didn't take any expensive courses, had no mentors and probably only spent a few hundred dollars getting set up. \n\nIt took me a while to refine my niche but what I now focus on now is building simple yet powerful websites that get huge results. \nI usually charge between 4-15k and usually have a waiting list of 2-3 websites. \n\nWhile I made good money on these websites its nice to know that the value I added is many times more and all my clients have been very satisfied. \n\nI am still in the early stages of figuring this all out though so I will continue to add to this post with more lessons if people want. \n\n\nSo my humble advice on how to begin:\n\n*** I only build \"custom\" HTML websites, I don't know/use wordpress except in some rare cases for add on blog/news sections to my sites. Why? Most of my clients are very busy, non-tech people. They don't want or have time to update their websites. They want it built well and they want it to run itself. HTML is a lot better for this and when done right looks way more professional and requires less maintenance (IMO). I don't have anything against WordPress just that I prefer to use HTML and both work fine for what I am doing. ***\n\n\nHow to quickly begin with HTML:\n\nTake the HTML and CSS lessons on https://www.codecademy.com/. \nYou can also do the JS section but I didn't and have been just fine. \n\n\nNext take the following UDEMY course (non affiliate):\nhttps://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/\n\n\nAfter this you will now know how to edit and work with HTML themes. What does that mean?\n\nWell there is no point creating a website from scratch. That takes years of coding experience and a lot of time for each new clients. Luckily enough people have gone and created HTML themes - its an already coded website where you just rearrange, switch out the pictures and text and add in a few extra bits. I am making this sound simpler than it is but its still quiet simple. \n\nAn example of a theme is here... (again non affiliate)\n\nhttps://themeforest.net/item/foundry-multipurpose-html-variant-page-builder/11562108?s_rank=9\n\nIt just a blank slate with a certain style that you work with. While this may seem like strange or cheating (I thought this was how to learn to build websites!??) its not. Anyone with an Internet connection can create a website these days so that is not where I try to add value. I add value by building a website with a purpose. I aim to build websites that get results and make money, or whatever they are trying to achieve, for the owner. Its not about code, its about how it helps the owner. \n\n*** I hope this doesn\u2019t piss off the obviously good coders on here, I do my best to code well but I am still learning ***\n\n\nSo how do you build a website that gets great results?\n\nGood question. \n\nSo first important thing is your clients want sales not a website. \nThey don\u2019t want a website that looks amazing, has cool videos and sections, talks about the companies recent golf tournament or how they really wanted to do X since they were 5 UNLESS it helps gets sales. Everything must be about getting a result. \n\nEvery page, link, click and action on the website is to help facilitate the growth of the company and sales. \n\nLets take for example an immigration lawyer website...\n\nIs the goal of the site to teach you about immigration law?\nIs it to show you stats of work, trade and education within the country?\nIs it to teach you about what to do when you first arrive, what to pack, what to expect?\n\nNo.\n\nThe whole purpose of that website is for the user to either book a consultation or contact them regarding their services. Which both lead to that person hiring them as their immigration lawyer. \n\nNow it might use some of the above points to help with that goal but it only has one main purpose. Everything we do for that client must help with that goal or if it doesn't help... be removed. \n\n\n\nOnce you sell results there is no limit to what you can charge and achieve. \n\n\nSo where do a lot of people go wrong?\n\nThe types of clients you help. \n\nImagine for a second the website you build will only ever generate one sale per year. Maybe only one sale ever. \n\n\n\nNow lets go over some businesses you could build a website for...\n\nClient one: Jimmy &amp; Friends Coffee Shop.\nOne sale is a cup of coffee or maybe if they are lucky a lunch special. One sale profit: $3-10 profit maybe.\n\nClient Two: Jimmy &amp; Co Travel Agency.\nMaybe that one sale is a trip to Paris, or maybe even a round the world one year break. Profits on travel are slim though and the internet is really driving down those juice margins. One sale profit: $150- $1,000 profit maybe.\n\nClient Three: Jimmy Inc. Industrial Clean Up Services.\nNow this website is not on the sexy side of things. It won't exact be winning website of the year award or going viral on FB but...\nOne sale of a large scale clean up at that oil refinery this winter... Maybe $500,000 to $4 million. Maybe more.\n\nNow when it comes time to sell websites you always want to aim to get your clients ten times the results that they invest in you.\n\nSo lets do the maths...\n\nClient One: You can justify 30c - $1\nClient Two: You can justify $15 - $100\nClient Three: You can justify $50k to $400,000.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same amount of time dealing with the client, same amount of time coding, same amount of time hiring a pro photographer. Very different result. \n\nNow what you charge is your own choice. But the above example should clearly show who to build for:\n\n- Construction\n- Industrial Services\n- Engineering\n- Oil\n- Legal\n- Medical\n- Other Blue Collar niches\n\nThe first four are my favorite. Unsexy, boring, aggressive clients (people are scared to call them which I like!), potnetial large contracts.\n\n\n\"Hey but what about tech start ups and that new app, they are making a zillion dollars. Lets go build for them!!!\"\n\nNo way and here is why...\n\n- They are in the design and internet business, they know guys already or have minimum wage slaves to work round the clock on design and websites\n- There is no shortage of guys trying to approach the \"cool\" companies for web design\n- You will always be replaceable and undercut by others\n- They won't see your value\n\nYour aim is to become a problem solver for large, boring, industrial companies that know nothing about the internet and want to deal with a \"regular guy\" to fix that website.\n\n\n\n*** Disclaimer ***\n\nWhile $15k+ a month (sales) might sound like a lot it\u2019s not really. It\u2019s enough. Enough to invest in my real businesses and cover my basic living costs. Not every month is clean profit. I reinvest a lot of money into education, design and growing. Things go wrong and learning from scratch is hard work. Some jobs run overtime, some things I have to do twice, or three times or more. \n\nI am not sipping cocktails on some beach while I go code once or twice a week on a hammock. \nI have since got a bed but I still live quite humble. I code 8 - 10 hours a day and also spend half the morning at Uni trying to learn Spanish. \n\nThis is a crash course on entrepreneurship while you earn money. You have to learn to sell, cold call, manage, outsource, and so on. Everyday. \nCoding websites is time intensive by nature. \n\nIf you are looking for easy money this probably isn't it. If you are looking to learn about business really fast though while funding and learning how to grow your own business this is excellent. Just want to add that in before someone thinks this is some overnight hack plan.\n\nNext year I am going to focus on scaling more and bringing on some part time staff. At the moment I have some copywriters and use some people off UpWork and Fiverr. There is a lot more I could talk about but this post is huge. I have posted some of this info on another forum before but I wanted to added it here since I have got a lot of value from a few posts on this sub reddit before.\n\nI will answer whatever questions you might have. I also have a little FB group where we help each other out... https://www.facebook.com/groups/makemoneywithwebdesign/  (no business or spamming please - its just to help each other)\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully not too many typos. \n\n\n1st Edit:\n\nThanks for all the positive comments and feedback. I will try get to everyone soon.\n\nI got through maybe half those comments and I will hit up more later after work. Sales seems to be a common theme so Ill expand on that too.\n\nHope this advice helps. I won't be \"proving\" anything but hopefully my advice shows I know what I am talking about. I definitely am not a great coder but the work I do has added a lot of value and revenue to my clients so I feel great about what I have done. This and other forums (fastlane forum) have helped me a lot over the years so its great to give back. I actually had some doubts about posting here since its a big wilder than other threads but I like the pressure and it helps me step up my game. \nIll be back later tonight to post more. Thanks.\n\n\n2nd and final part: Sales\n\nSide intro note: This was a simple AMA, I am not out to prove or convince anyone. If you think 10K a month is some huge figure you will approach it as such. It is not, its 2 big sales, or 1 small sale. There are a billion terrible websites. Learn to sell (from real resources not a quick reddit thread) and you can get in on this action. I know guys doing 40-50K a month with this stuff as a small team, and I know people doing 100-200k a month in ecommerce. 10k is small. When I started it seemed huge but its better to try focus on how little sales really make up that figure. I won't be responding to any more 20 point lists. I don't care and particular posters failures or bitterness doesn't change my reality. Anyway its only like 5 people but they keep posting - use that energy and pick up a phone!\n\nHow to find jobs when you are first starting: Google\n\nAs for finding companies that could need a new website its very easy. In fact its probably one of the easiest services to find potential customers for.\n\nJob formula: Google... \"niche industry\" + \"local town\" and go through the first few pages of results. Anything that looks below par is suitable. I try go for companies that are clearly doing well but haven't updated the website in 3-6 years. You can usually tell by the date in the footer.\n\nFor example I google \"Carpet search Calgary\", Within the first few searches this site came up...\n\nhttp://envirosurfaceremovers.com/\n\nProbably a 4k job. Nice thing is he is ranked high on Google but has a poorly converting site. I don't have to focus on SEO or convincing him people will visit since its already on the first page. All he needs now is good copy, images and a clear path of desired action for customers to take. I would probably start the phone call off with that.\n\nYou could do that all day and not run out of companies that need a better website.\n\nI go for certain niches - guys that probably don't like to deal with web companies. A lot of the companies outside of bug cities are run by red blooded, blue collar guys. The last thing they want is some \"nerd\" ( I am a secret nerd) they have to deal with. I run a no-bullshit web design company and know the way these people like to do deals and communicate. I don't talk about \"migrating hosting\" I just simply say the website has to be moved etc. I have 3 years experience on the oil rigs and grew up in a construction family so I know how to get on well with these guys. I think thats one main area that sets me apart. \n\nI hear a lot of \"our current web guy is impossible to deal with, he is really weird / annoying /lazy / arrogant \". Its not a tough game to be better than the rest and Im only getting started. You can see by some posters on any coding/business forum that their attitude is not helping - be \"cool\", friends, helpful and useful. If you are stuck on this read How to Win Friends and Influence People. It works. \n\nNow let me show you how this works in realtime (don't all call this person at once ha)...\nToday (like right now) this guy is using Adwords for \"Immigration Lawyer Canada\" ...\nhttp://www.somjen.com/\nThats an expensive search. Go check out that site. Easy sale. Already spending money, you just need to redirect it.\n\nWeb design is the easiest business in the world to find new sales - you have a full list of them anytime you search anything. \n\nI have already covered what to say when they pick up in the comments below. If you can't sell to people with sites this bad then please go work on that, its key to making bigger money.  \n\nOnce you do a few websites, and get great results, it is even easier to sell. Slowly move up to larger and larger businesses. As you move up you will need to improve on some things like invoices, email communication, information request forms etc but you can learn it all as it goes. \n\nWays to even boost more sales...\n- Sales guys on commission (covered below)\n- 10% referral or free work for businesses that promote you\n- Working the network - Lets say you do a website for X Service in New York, then when its done call every other X Service in nearby cities. Show them your results OR call every other different business that is geographically close to X service. Work the connections\n- Believe in what you do. I love helping people and I love my websites. If you treat this as some money scheme or scam people will be able to tell and you get sales. If you look at this thread its like 90% upvoted because I gave a lot of value upfront and people responded, its the same with companies. Not everyone will respond (just like this thread ha) but you only need 2/3 a month. \n\n***********************\nAIM BIG\n***********************\n\nI did just as much work for $150 a month as I did for $15,000. Well maybe a little more work now but not much. Sales for a HUGE site and a small one takes the same amount of time, so does emails, so do calls, so does hosting, so does invoicing, so does 100 other things. The only bid difference is design and code but that is only 30% of a job. \n\nMy point is it is easier to aim big. Aiming big pushes you harder and gives you the reward to keep going. Aiming small sucks and everyday is a drag. I have been there. So instead of dialing the small cafe dial Jimmys Tow Truck company, believe in what you can do and what you can achieve. \n\nWell that is it. This wasn't a \"here are the super secrets to $$$\", it was an AMA. These are my best answers and I hope you enjoyed them. I am still learning and still growing. I mess up all the time still but I keep the show on the road. If you think I am definitely wrong about X - maybe I am, but enough of this works to hold it all together. I got a lot of great responses and I am very grateful. If I was starting again I would have loved to see something like this and it probably would have saved months of time. Scarysaturday if you ever come to South America Ill buy you a beer to cheer you up. \n\nThanks everyone. \n",

                    "comment": " Hey just woke up and this looks pretty busy! I will answer all of these today. So I used Google primarily in the beginning. I mean its a directory of bad websites ha. I pick a certain city (I usually target Canada cause I lived there) and just start going through niches. SO for example Toronto + Carpet Cleaning. I go through the first two pages and pick out any bad websites. I give those a call and explain that there SEO is already taken care of (usually cause the domain is so old) and that with some a better website they would be converting the traffic they already have a lot more. It makes starting the sale (and adding value) a lot easier. \n\nAfter I got a few of these sales word started to get out that I was good at what I do and I got more and more referrals. At the moment they make up about 50% or more of my new websites. If you do great work and you add a lot of value you will quickly be in demand. And of course it helps with cold calling too when you can point to past results. The first few months are hard but when you have a track record it starts to get a lot easier. \n\nThere are so many terrible websites in so many cities. And your average web developer can only really do about 20 - 30 jobs a year anyway so they are not running out. Let me know if you any part expanded on. \n",

I pick maybe 3-5 clients per week and really look for people I can help A LOT. I then do up a really detailed email and/or call and tell them up front a lot of ways they can improve on their site. I have done this and people have gone and hired someone cheaper (ha!) but usually they end up going with me. I don't like to cold call a lot and I hate spam/hard sales. People really appreciate it, even when they don't buy, and word gets out either way. Nowadays I make very little calls and most of my work is done on the researching and preparing side. With websites its great because you can already see nearly everyhtign before you even talk to the client, with proper homework you can really find people who will get a lot of value out of a new website (and you can charge a % of that!)\n",

My most profitable projects are for small businesses that need a great look for $2k. Usually it's less than 20 hours work. I've lately gotten into building APIs, tying into ERCOT, and building custom pricing engines for clients and despite the projects being $10-20k, I'm not making any money on them. \n\nSo OP is giving solid advice here and there is a lot of business out there for someone interested.

But in this case I *think* OP is legit because he didn't drop affiliate links or try to get us to sign up for something. \n\nI think the reason why OP didn't include the sales bit in detail is because that comes second nature to him and therefore it's not obvious for him to explain it. \n\nI'm in the same place as OP with my web dev I've been doing for 3 years but it's taken longer for me to get to the same monthly revenue because I'm not as good of a sales person. In fact, 60-70% of my sales come through other agencies that do the cold calling and then bring me in when they have a serious client on the hook. I'll drive to the meeting and takes notes, make a short presentation of expertise and potential solutions and then follow up for the close. \n\nSo it's taken me some time to build the pipeline to where it is now. I need to diversify my client base more honestly. \n\nRegarding the outbound sales part... Find somewhere that can deliver you warm leads. I've got a place that's very reputable and only costs me $50/mo for the chance to bid on warm web design leads. I only close about 10% but I've made $15k+ off of it over the past 6 months. Another one will give me really specific hot leads for $45 each but requires I commit to $1k in leads at a time. But the close rate is good, around 30%. Obviously I'm not going to name where I get my leads from because duh, but those lead sources are out there. \n\nThe biggest thing for me is learning how to sell (because I hate selling) and for me that's by giving them a solution I believe in and just being genuine and personable during the sales process. People buy from people, you know? ",

How do you actually get past gate-keepers, how do you not get filtered into the noise of every other cold-calling asshole.\n\nI want to know this about cold calling too. We don't usually cold call, but I'll summarize what we do...\n\nWe built web apps (websites with a lot of programming). We charge $1,200/day for each resource (person that is working on it). We fill our sales funnel by doing free webinars on web related topics that we think CTOs and project managers will be interested in; collect leads from those webinars and then follow up with those leads. I would say that method has about a 1-2% closing rate. But, we're usually closing $50k+ deals and if we can get 100 people in one webinar then chances are good that we'll close one deal.\n\nHow do we get 100 people in a webinar? They come from various places where we add value and therefore people find us because they're searching for that information: our website and blog, our social media accounts, and our partners. We partner with various vendors to provide solutions for customers that they sell their web or IT products to. Where legal, we are able to cross promote our products to their email list and market their products to our email list. \n\nCTOs and project managers are busy, but they also want to stay on top of the latest information. Webinars are great because they know they don't have to pay attention if something comes up and they can still get something from it almost no matter how little attention they pay. But, we try to make the first two slides mind blowing so that they're hooked and pay close attention from that point on.\n\nThe webinar topics vary, but for example: a couple times a year a new study showing mobile adoption or whatever similar topic comes out and we'll develop 20 minutes of content on that topic and then do another 15 minutes on our process for working with customers and developing their solution. We find that educating them on a fresh topic is immediately helpful and memorable for long enough that they will remember us for follow up contact and then educating them on our process is a great way to set expectations and lead to a discussion about sales.",

How do you actually get past gate-keepers, how do you not get filtered into the noise of every other cold-calling asshole.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that OP is probably pretty extroverted and/or personable, based on what he said about his background (traveling a lot, open to new experiences, risk taking, working odd jobs in different industries). Not trying to toot this guy's horn but if you can work with and relate to both grungy oil workers and stuffy lawyers with shitty websites then you can probably get along with and charm anyone if you wish. \n\nI mean, do you think the fact that OP worked in the oil industry maybe had some role in him securing an oil company as a client? Just that little \"oh yeah, I was working out in the fields when it crashed and now I'm coding websites! hah, that's the industry for you!\" line (or something to that effect) he probably dropped is going to mean more than \"well I've worked as as a web developer since before the internet existed\" to rich, old fashioned and probably tech-illiterate oil executives. \n\nThat's honestly the only real secret to cold calls. Some of us have this natural ability to immediately hook someone in and keep them listening, some of us are able to find something to immediately connect with others on, and some of us aren't scared of rejection. Those skills can be learned for sure, but it's not easy. I don't have them, but whenever I'm dealing with sales/marketing/customer service people on the phone it's immediately recognizable which ones have em and which ones don't.",

I drink it up!) but having industry experience definitely helps a little. I am a very extrovert person, although I have worked on it a lot, and once a group is over 3 or 4 big I kinda just stop talking. I just go for a natural conversation approach, like this person was your friend and you wanted to let them know what to do with the website. I have had people agree with what I say but they can't afford me so I tell them what to do for cheap or free. Just add a lot of value upfront and people will respond in time. Imagine getting an email as long as the original post (well maybe not that long!) that was all about how to help your business and improve your website. Lots of people just try some template style approach and never go in-depth so business owners know its BS. I list specific things are not working or could be better. They know from my call or email that I have spent a lot of time going over their website, and it usually pays off. \n\nI know how to connect for sure but I definitely still fear rejection, thats why I try get as many warm leads as possible. Straight cold calls still suck for me but I just imagine a happy customer with a growing business and go for it. \n\nYou gave a great point - target businesses that you can somewhat relate to or have any experience in.

I'll say that as a programmer who is an employee, it's hard to stay motivated to keep doing it.\n\nAs *painful* as I know the other stuff is, even though programmers are paid well, we're not paid so extraordinarily well that we want to look at a computer *constantly* unless we have a real passion for code.\n\nAnd the person with a passion for code is more often working in the open source world, contributing to projects they find interesting.\n\nThe fact is, if I had a proper safety net, I'd prefer to drop my employer (even though they are *awesome*) and start off making peanuts, doing everything myself, then trying to find one or two really motivated people to bring on board as I become more confident.  One of my friends is a business analyst major in California, and another is a highly educated mechanical engineer in Croatia.  So I have someone who could help me run the business, and another who could help me do the work.  But that's for way down the road.",

They struggle to get new clients so they reach out asking for salespeople to get them clients. The biggest problem is that 95% of those web and online marketing guys aren't willing to pay any base rate, and just offer 50% or so of the price from each new website or marketing campaign.\n\nIn 99% of businesses, if not 100% of businesses, you *absolutely must* be able to sell, or have people on board that can. Somebody who has a shit product or service but can sell it well will do better than somebody with a great product who can't sell it, almost every single time.\n\nWhich brings me back to the designers and developers who are looking for salespeople to find them clients. My take on it is this: If I'm going to get the sales, why am I going to split if 50/50 with you, when I have to find the leads, approach them and *close the sale*, when I can do just that and outsource the work and keep a far greater percentage?\n\nI've said this before: If you're a developer or designer and are unable or unwilling to sell, then you must go and take your skills and work for a company or agency that can sell. It's as simple as that.\n\nI've recently started a copywriting service but the more posts I see on Reddit regarding sales, the more I think I'd be better just setting up a web dev/design company and outsourcing the work.\n\nYou're totally right in thinking that a lot of the posts similar to the OP here (I'm not saying the OP here is) are full of shit and just a way to try and find new clients.\n\nHowever, as somebody who can sell, I know the figures don't sound unrealistic.\n\nIn regards to your question about how to get past gatekeepers and not sound like every other \"cold-calling asshole\" as you put it, that's like me asking a question about HTML, CSS or coding. They're skills that you must learn. Some people are born able, others must learn it.\n\nCashflow is the lifeblood of all businesses and if you can't make sales then concentrate on what you can do. Either bring a sales \"asshole\" on board who knows what he's doing, or become another asshole who can sell and make money.",

I understand that sales &amp; marketing are the lifeblood of essentially any business (that's why the most successful web shops in my local area churn out **absolute dog shit** for their clients).  \n\nThey know how to market themselves better than me though, so good for them (it's a damn shame for the business owners though).\n\nAnyway, my comment stems from a deep frustration with vague posts like this touting absurd revenue numbers for their first year in business under the guise that they have some sort of \"sales mystique\" that I just don't see.\n\nTo suck my own dick for a minute, I'm a very naturally outgoing guy myself.  It's very easy for me to build rapport with people on the phone quickly.\n\nHowever, when you *actualy start cold calling* the reality of the situation becomes quite clear: **business owners that you want to work with don't have the time for you, and go out of their way to filter you from their day.**\n\nDude, I've called *hundreds* of local law firms, and not once was I put through to anyone that was even remotely close to the decision-maker.  Here's what actually happens when you cold-call nowadays:\n \n * You get the \"cool, I'll let him know and get back to you!\" bullshit.\n * You get hung up on.\n * You frustrate the gatekeeper by being to pushy.\n \nNo gatekeeper in their right mind is going to put a solicitor through to their boss because they're just trying to not get fired from their shitty phone operator job.\n\nSo that being said, either I'm completely inept at communicating with other people and just not seeing it, or this guy is bullshitting us.\n\nOccam's razor applies here: in situations of uncertainty, the simpler of two choices is likely the correct one.",

I have the same level of frustration as you with a lot of posts in this sub and similar subs too. It was as much a personal rant as it was a reply directed at yourself.\n\nHaving said that, I think you need to overcome some of the hurdles and difficulties you're experiencing with cold calling. If you're making hundreds of calls and not getting through to the right person then you definitely need to switch your game plan around. Whether it's your choice of words or how you deliver them, something is obviously not working. Again, as somebody with a background in sales, often it can come down to a single word or short phrase that can make or break a sales call.\n\nEven the best salespeople can make a hundred calls and not get through to the right person, so for somebody without that experience such as yourself, you're definitely going to get a *lot* of knock backs, and encounter gatekeepers who sound like they can't be arsed listening to you.\n\nI'm tempted to do a few YouTube videos on how to sell websites over the phone. The problem is that I don't want to be tarnished in with 99% of people who make similar sales instructional videos and informational pieces on the internet.\n\nIf I can think of a way to make something (a post/website/YouTube channel) on how to sell websites and online services without it coming across scammy/spammy/Grant Cardone-esque then I'll give it a bash.\n",

So this will maybe seem backwards but ill explain - I don't do that many calls (not anymore), I have never used ads and my own website is actually pretty average (have not posted in my FB page in months). I did all this stuff in the beginning and got no traction. So what I seen that works really well and what I use is crazy over delivering on EVERYTHING. On the phone I am great and friendly (Im naturally extrovert), my service is great, if they have any issue I am there right away, I do great design, I explain it all and so on. The clients love it, many complain about past web guys who talk down to them or were impossible to deal with. Once the sites are up a few weeks they usually start to get results. These two things combined means they love me. So they start telling everyone and I usually target businesses close by or related next \"hey you know Sarah at X company ya? well I just did her site and I would love to do yours too\". Business owners love to talk and you will start to get referrals. \n\nI also have a few sales guys on commission (like 3) and if they sell a site they get a %. Its commission only too so no loss to me. They are big networkers in different niches and meet a lot of business owners. They are not pushing my websites hard but they look out for people I might be able to help and they get a great kickback if I do close a website. This has helped a lot too and I actually do the sales for them, I just want warm leads. \n\nI hate spam callers and as a business owner if someone called me with some boiler room script I would hang up right away. But I have some much good info on the phone and am very non pushy so people like that and its a lot easier. I know it might seem like BS but I just think if I add enough value some of it will come back to me, cheesy but it works. Hope that helps.",

Dude crazy over-delivering is the **standard** nowadays.  If you're not over-delivering, you're doing something wrong.  \n\nThis doesn't get you more sales though, it gets you very happy clients who forget to talk you up to their coworkers because they're understandably too concerned with their own lives.\n\n&gt; On the phone I am great and friendly (Im naturally extrovert)\n\nAs am I.\n\n&gt; [...]my service is great\n\nAs are mine.\n\n&gt; If they have any issue I am there right away.\n\nAs am I, providing unparalleled customer support is an easy way to \"wow\" people.\n\n&gt; I explain it all and so on\n\nThis is a bit concerning to me.

It simply doesn't work that way because the big players in these kinds of industries **simply will not let you get a hold of them**.\n\nThey often have entire agencies on file whose sole purpose is to man the phones and give solicitors a hard time.  It doesn't sound like what you're saying makes sense it the real world.\n\nI've called *hundreds* of attorneys in my local area.

Did a few websites for shitty clients on UpWork (we've all been there, glad you made it out alive).\n2. Did a few cheaper websites for friends and colleagues (makes sense).\n3.

I made an account to respond because I'm annoyed but also I want you to know that this is how you're coming off to people and it could very well be affecting your business because god damn you seem really fucking unlikeable. The reason you're not getting as much work as OP is because you seem like the kind of person where nothing is ever your fault and the world is always out to get you. Stop it. Get better at what you do. OP says his customer service is great. You say \"well so is mine!\" which is what a child would say. How about instead, take a breath, and ask yourself \"what can I do better?\". To this I imagine you would say \"But I've done that already! I've got all the social, sales, and programming skills a person could ever need!\" to which I say, clearly you fucking don't, or else you wouldn't be on Reddit complaining about people trying to give advice. Rather than writing fucking novels trying to diminish the success of someone else, just accept responsibility that you're the reason your sales aren't where you want and for the love of god never, ever come at your customers with the same attitude you've displayed in this thread because it's honestly ridiculous. \n\nLastly:\n\n&gt;It simply doesn't work that way because the big players in these kinds of industries simply will not let you get a hold of them.\n\nOP isn't going after big players. He's going after businesses that can afford 5k websites, which is literally any business with 4 employees ever. Those types of businesses don't have gatekeepers. You just call the guy in charge and start chatting. If you're calling literally *hundreds* of attorneys and never once talking to someone who claimed they can make that decision then I hate to tell you dude, but if you're really *not* an uncharismatic drone you sure as fuck are coming off like one over the phone. Obviously people respond to fucking cold sales calls and to say they don't is being incredibly ignorant of multiple billion dollar industries that thrive on them.\n\n\nJust take a look at your own shit man.

I can't go into the smallest details of how I do everything but I think the general overall advice should help people move forwards. \n\nThere isn't many gatekeeps on a smaller construction or engineering company. Usually the owner answers the phone or has a personal number listed. If not I just ask to speak to them directly and call them by there first name (Hi is Pete there I need to talk to him). If I do gets a \"who is this\" then \u00cf have emailed before about doing business together, he should now me\". No gatekeeper will keep asking questions if they think its a client. Just use a normal tone and not some call-robot voice and you will be fine. Works 90% of the time.\n\nIf things are not working you need to be honest with yourself why not. For me certain things were holding me back but I would read, take a course or watch YouTube videos to get past those sticks points. I honestly think sales is a reflection of yourself and you need to be adding value and have a great attitude for people to respond. \n\nAnyway I think he means well but I can't help someone that is a sceptic at every step.

His pitch, his approach,  making the client feel overall comfortable with working with him. Kudos to OP ! I am also in sales, specifically merchant services. I actually wrote a small reply regarding MS in /personalfinance just yesterday.  Anyway, I have trained many reps with the same product knowledge and sales approach . So often, it wasnt the rep the knew the products inside and out. It was the rep that could establish a friendly conversation that would close new business deals and , in turn,  begin the momentum to successful selling. Just my 2 cents. Happy Selling !",

Maybe your local dentist, gym, garage, lawyer, fitness trainer, whatever. These jobs don't show much results (as in revenue for the client) but they show you can do great work and build a nice website. After this start approaching bigger companies that are have horrible websites. Its so easy to make these better and add value and soon work will get out. In the beginning you have to have faith and do some work for cheap/free but its better than using UpWork and never getting anywhere. \n\nIf you are confident you can get results it might only take one good job and then people start to know about you/approach you. Don't keep working for free/cheap though but make sure to really kill it with your first few jobs. After you get results then start to raise that price up and approach bigger clients. Hope that helps. ",

You could send people to go have a look and keep it up to date with great pics and customer feedback. The trick is getting people to go find it, they probably won't stumble upon it. I think this would get better results. \n\nIf you did want a website I would just do something really clean and small with some of your best work. More of an online business card style thing. But for now the best investment would be a good camera to take pics of your work and some sort of free social media page to present them. Maybe check out a cheap Udemy course on photos or FB marketing. Hope that helps. ",

A few questions:\n\nHow do you feel about using square space themes as the baseline template and using HTML/CSS injections to customize the look and feel?\n\nDo you also do the design as well as copywriting and any photography for your clients?\n\nDo you have any tips on what to say in your cold call/cold email? I already know a number of large companies in my area that are looking for website design but don't know where to start nor understand the value of having a good website and brand presence.\n\nAnyways, really looking forward to your response and I'm happy for all your success!\n",

I don't understand your comment about the same pic? I don't have testimonials. Anyway you will find the same thing with my FB page, its way out of date. Neither of these things drive sales for me and I have stopped linking out to new sites from there. My analytics were saying like 5 people a week came to visit so it seemed like a huge waste of time. What companies care about is actual results so I usually go off my last few jobs and take about what I can do for them. I know its highly ironic having a bad website as a web guy (ha!) but why focus where its wasted energy. That being said I will be updating it soon as I want to step up my game next year. \n\nI have posted a lot over here... https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/how-to-learn-code-start-a-web-company-15k-per-month-within-9-months.69971/  and since that thread got really popular I stopped linking or mentioning new sites.

I ended up starting blogging recently, but I'm not yet making profit out of it. Found another unrelated job, too.\n\nBut yeah - I'm very happy to hear someone in a similar situation as me a year ago did something like that :) Congratulations, and good luck for the years to come !!",

A good marketer can sell a bad product with a good presentation. Even if your websites aren't sexy, you can still hit a homerun with the message you project.\n\nAs long you continue with that approach you will continue to make your clients happy.",

Myself and a few other developers I know online are having issues with how to structure our payments. \n\nAn initial design and development fee including a maintenance package seems the way to go but how do you do things? Unlike you we use wordpress so they can easily upload and change things as they see fit but I would like to get more into the consulting aspect (helping them make conversions rather than do their own thing).\nLike you mentioned this is a great way to learn about other businesses and I would like to be involved and charge for my time. \n\nThank you!\n",

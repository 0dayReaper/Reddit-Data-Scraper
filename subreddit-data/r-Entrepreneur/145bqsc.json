To give you an idea meter taxis charge 0.5 usd per kilometer here. I\u2019m planning to charge 25 usd per session.\nAnd this\u2019s a third world country. Am I being realistic here?",

Even if you find some sort of rolling bag to put your equipment in, it sounds like it might be a little rough. \n\nAt the same time, it may be worth it to make some money and avoid getting a car.",

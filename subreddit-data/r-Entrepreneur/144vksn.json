    "postText": "I run an email marketing agency that nets $25K/Month. I only work with a handful of clients on retainer. I've been at my peak bandwidth for the last few months and have not been able to take on new clients, so I have just hired my first employee that starts next week.   \n\n\nI started my agency around 8 months ago, and since the beginning have been working with an awesome media buying agency that has fed me a few great clients - I pay them referral fees and we have a great relationship.  \n\n\nThe media buying agency, which is just 2 people at the moment, has asked if I'm interested in selling/merging with them to lead the email arm of their agency. I would likely gain meaningful equity and be salaried. It would mean giving up on building my own solo-owned agency without really knowing how I could far I could take it since I'm only just now hiring in order to grow.\n\nThere are a ton of pros and cons that are specific to this situation, but I'm curious for people who have been acqui-hired - was it a good decision in hindsight? Do you regret not continuing to build your company by yourself while maintaining control?  How did it feel to go from running a business solo to workign with partners?",

They also seem to have plan to have their own email arm. If you reject their proposal, I think you need to consider losing them as your client as they will do it on their own. If it's hard to avoid the evitable, then it may be better to join them and flourish together. I suggest consulting to your lawyer to get good advantage of this deal.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI run a small arcade and recently, we\u2019ve been approached to put our games in a chain of popular pizza restaurants. They get great traffic and according to other operators, a pizza place usually generates good income. The issue is that I need $150k to fund it, and I\u2019m fully leveraged. Estimated annual income from the new route is about $80-100k before labor costs/tax/etc, $50-70k after those costs. \n\nAre there any lenders that can process things quickly, and can use the games themselves as collateral? Our credit is just OK - probably around 680. We literally just opened our doors and are still eating a lot of start up costs so books and credit report don\u2019t look great now. But it\u2019s such a great opportunity I don\u2019t want to miss out on it.",

Have you asked the pizza chain owners and /or investors if they'd like to work out a creative financing structure or maybe looking at leasing versus getting a loan to pay for the games? (I'm assuming the loan is for purchasing the equipment)",

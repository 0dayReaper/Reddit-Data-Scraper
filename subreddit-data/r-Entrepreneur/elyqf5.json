    "postText": "This may be pretty controversial to lots of you here who hero worship people like Gary Vee and others, but it is important. The industry that has developed around entrepreneurship is infested with what I call 'Toxic Positivity'. It is dangerous and counterproductive. \n\nHere are some examples: \n\n* Telling you its possible that everyone can have businesses making 6 or 7 figures of revenue per month. Yes it happens, but it is not particularly likely or even desirable in many cases. Keep your goals achievable and realistic. Dont be blinded by the unicorns. \n* We are often told you need to get up at 4.30am and never sleep. This is obvious BS. Get up at a time that keeps you productive, get a decent nights sleep and look after yourself. Burnout is real, if you dont stop, your body will force you to stop. \n* Its really difficult. There is no shortcut to success. There is no automatic formula someone can teach you. Experience matters. Dont forget this when you're seeing adverts telling you to buy ebooks in the latest online trend. Stop looking for the next big thing, stop thinking short term, stop wanting there to be a hidden secret to making it work. \n* Dont neglect your friends and family, they are a vital support network that no amount of money can buy back at the end. Its not necessary to avoid all social events or relationships in order to succeed. \n* Contrary to what we are told, not everyone needs to aim to be a millionaire or billionaire to succeed at business. There are millions of people running profitable businesses, living good lives that operate at a smaller scale. \n* Owning a Lamborghini isnt important in life. Remember what real value is. \n* There is no shame in not being an entrepreneur. People in jobs aren't all idiots who are being manipulated by corporations. Working hard at a job and bringing home a reliable paycheck for your family is honourable, will most likely pay more and offer you long term contentment. \n* The best investment you can make is in yourself. Eat healthily. Exercise or play sports. Give yourself mental health days if you need them. Use your support network. Keep learning. It will all pay off throughout your life. \n* It isn't all about content all of the time. At some point you are going to have to actually make tangible sales and stop designing content. \n* Motivation porn is exactly like regular porn, its impossible to live up to and warps your understanding of how this all works.",

Lots of physical labor.\n\nBy the end, I was tired and *I was making mistakes.* Not at my work, which is a relief, but I got home and promptly broke a glass and lost my keys and in general was careless and frustrated.\n\nExhaustion isn't a status symbol, it's a liability.",

Now imagine feeling that way at 65.  Now imagine knowing that you're senile early, because you just HAD to have a six-figure salary.  \n  \nNobody rides for free.

I have some considerable work hours behind it.  And now I have some decades in life to speak from. \n\n1. Burnout is real.  This applies to you.  It will affect everything about you and around you.  And it will have a very real hangover where you will not be producing quality work.  \n2. You gotta discover who you are and plan accordingly.  Are you Jeff Bezos that will work himself into a grave?  Are you the type that we don't hear about that have a material exit, invest, and live a passive income life?\n3. Get over yourself.  Whatever you're doing is not so important that you should ignore every other facet in life.  You can try that road but you'll just be a miserable person that'll spend years in therapy trying to find your humanity again.  And it may just be too late. \n\nI've hired and fired.  I've built and lost.  I've built and won.  I've gone through bankruptcy.  And the world keeps spinning.  \n\nMy regrets stem from just how life and death all of this felt and the structure that I created that was built on a foundation of life starting AFTER I have X success.  But X moves.  It's its nature.  \n\nAnd just like an alcoholic trying to find the bottom of the bottle, you won't find X.\n\n**So, no one is telling you this: the real game is about sustainability**.  \n\nCan you build something that outlasts your emotional sprints.  Everyone can put the hours in.  Learning how to craft a better thought will beat the majority of the competition and that takes time NOT working.  \n\nYou have to specifically spend time doing nothing to hone this skill.  \n\nYou have to figure out who you are (#2 above) and set yourself up for success as a whole.  Then push back the waves of anxiety and depression.  \n\nIf you serve just one part of yourself then - if you're lucky - you should expect a come-to-Jesus crash later.  And I promise you that undoing the layers of dirt and dust that a lack of time to address your emotional needs gathers will be much harder than your current mission.",

Because you said what he's been saying for years, sometimes verbatim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Telling you its possible that everyone can have businesses making 6 or 7 figures of revenue per month. Yes it happens, but it is not particularly likely or even desirable in many cases. Keep your goals achievable and realistic. Dont be blinded by the unicorns. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLlfxR7FFc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLlfxR7FFc&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FAbhMdhKkEq5oOMJMUMrHUW&amp;index=36&amp;t=0s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We are often told you need to get up at 4.30am and never sleep. This is obvious BS. Get up at a time that keeps you productive, get a decent nights sleep and look after yourself. Burnout is real, if you dont stop, your body will force you to stop. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw2ShSnO72w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw2ShSnO72w) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Its really difficult. There is no shortcut to success. There is no automatic formula someone can teach you. Experience matters. Dont forget this when you're seeing adverts telling you to buy ebooks in the latest online trend. Stop looking for the next big thing, stop thinking short term, stop wanting there to be a hidden secret to making it work. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alEwUbcxMEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alEwUbcxMEs) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Dont neglect your friends and family, they are a vital support network that no amount of money can buy back at the end. Its not necessary to avoid all social events or relationships in order to succeed. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYIfRAd6dzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYIfRAd6dzg) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Contrary to what we are told, not everyone needs to aim to be a millionaire or billionaire to succeed at business. There are millions of people running profitable businesses, living good lives that operate at a smaller scale. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6fZ3Y16uIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6fZ3Y16uIc) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Owning a Lamborghini isnt important in life. Remember what real value is. \n\n[https://youtu.be/5Loa9UZSHAA?t=1115](https://youtu.be/5Loa9UZSHAA?t=1115)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;There is no shame in not being an entrepreneur. People in jobs aren't all idiots who are being manipulated by corporations. Working hard at a job and bringing home a reliable paycheck for your family is honourable, will most likely pay more and offer you long term contentment. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13hZGE052U8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13hZGE052U8) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The best investment you can make is in yourself. Eat healthily. Exercise or play sports. Give yourself mental health days if you need them. Use your support network. Keep learning. It will all pay off throughout your life. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9U8aVVW34c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9U8aVVW34c) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; It isn't all about content all of the time.

Most of them became famous afterwards and used this status to leverage into other business opportunities.\n\nIts often like the mexican sharpshooter (shoot some rounds and then draw the target around the holes). Some became successful and used this to tell others how its done. They take 100% credits for their success and totally neglecting that sometimes being at the right place at the right time and know the right people will help ypu tremendously. \n\nA ton of them even made their initial success during a time where customers hadnt access to google and online communites, cross-checking the facts. Yes a vast majority are loudmouth quacks that just overwhelm desperate people in bad life situations in buying some snakeoil from them.\n\nI have yet to see somone of these gurus coming from nothing and building a real successful business that provides value and isnt scamming its customers without the help of mummy and daddy's money or being somehow affiliated with someone who made it already.\n\nThe guys i know who did this, often are pretty down to earth, they work hard,they believe in their product big time, they failed often plus they always tell you it was a fucking grind.\n\nBut then again, most of their customers doesnt really want to have a blueprint to success. Even if there were a 100% formula they wouldnt follow it. They buy for the temporary sensation that they now have a quick fix, for an illusion to feel better about themselves.\n\nYou know why they all tell you education sucks and college or buying a house is for morons? Because this is their main target audience!\n\"Ha, see mum and dad, i told you college is for idiots. Now i am on my way to make billions. What you say now Tommy, smiling out of your fucking porsche driving to your job you fucking brainwashed moron. Whos the idiot now?? Now lets quickly get a credit card that still works and buy this course for 997 usd... ok great, wow i feel so good now. But before i begin getting all these benjamins, lets watch the new episodes of walking dead.. woah it feels good to be on the way to a successful life!\"",

This is the type of person who would benefit from your advice and consider it correct.\n\nHowever, if your ambitions are 300k - to millions, you are deluding yourself thinking you can get there working regular hours and not being a maniac. If this is your mindset with those types of massive ambitions, then you might as well quit this very moment, go get a regular job and live a stable life instead of wasting your time on business.\n\nThat's an unforgivng playground where there's always someone else willing to take your place, if you're not willing to take it yourself.\n\nAlso, hours of work are indeed important but aren't nearly as important as the industry you're in, and various other factors.\n\nA founder of an innovative FinTech company who works 8 hours a day will still likely make twice or even 3x more money than a person of a \"less valued industry\", such as a graphic designer who runs a design agency and works 12-14 hours a day.\n\nThere are some plateaus hard work alone just cannot break.\n\nJust as in bodybuilding. Two guys who've been working out with the same pace together for 6 years with the exact same program may look the same at first, slowly they will differentiate from each other in minor ways.\n\nIn the long run, eventually their bodybuilding aesthetic quality and visual appeal will be separated by their individual quality of genetics, body shape, the quality of their supplements and individual's bodily response to those supplements, etc.",

I regularly listen to his podcast and consume his content over different media. He's helped me immensely in shifting my mindset to a healthier place over time when I was in a bit of a darker place, in that the pursuit of the things that truly make you happy is extremely important, whether it's building a huge business, or just making dumb videos with your friends, or not going to college.

After quitting and working for another company my sleep has crept back up to about 6 hours of sleep a night things are much better.

I can\u2019t tell you how many times I heard him say \u201cI worked every single day off my twenties to get where I am today\u201d . He always follows up with \u201cbut I\u2019m crazy and not like most people \u201c . He also doesn\u2019t suggest never sleeping but rather his argument/point is for those who carry the excuse they don\u2019t have time. Most people can dedicate 1-2 hours a night before bed  to pursue something they love. I think that\u2019s the point .  \nHe actually encourages people to run away from the money and pursue what you love and what makes you happy.  Some times that can be portrayed toward \u201cmaking millions\u201c because a lot of his following are entrepreneurs looking for that financial freedom . \n\nThat all being said I read a line once in the book the subtle art of not giving a fuck  that was quit interesting \n\n\u201cThe desire for more positive experiences its self is a negative experience. And, paradoxically acceptance of ones negative experience is a positive experience \u201c\n\nGenerally  speaking I actually agree with the points you discuss.   But I couldn\u2019t help but to defend Gary on that one. He\u2019s a very logical guy and I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s exactly the toxic positivity poster boy like he might seem at first glance .",

Once things start growing and the ball starts rolling, you tend to simply go with it and at some point it will create an imbalance unless you consciously safeguard that balance. \n\n\nEspecially once you start to grow a team or are in the position to do so, it's vital to be OK with giving away control, and acknowledging the fact that you're not the best at every aspect. This is something that I'm now learning at a team of 25, not expecting myself to excel at every part just to try and live up to the image of a CEO needing to be perfect at every aspect to efficiently run a business. People tend to go for perfection as, and spend a lot of time on small improvements to make it 'perfect'.

He gets good sleep every night he can ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t214jolPE\\_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t214jolPE_0)), he says there's no short cut, he says sales are what really matters (although there's a false dichotomy here, content/branding IS how you get life long sales for him because you build trust and deeper interest over time. He lambasts people that call themselves business people and don't make actual dollars/sell), He literally says stuff doesn't matter and warns against people trying to keep up with the jones, he constantly says if you're happy making X amount and hanging out with friends and family all the time that's amazing, only says to hustle harder if you want to make more money and/or do something that necessitates working harder.",

            "comment": "This is a really fantastic post. I thank you for it.  \n\nI've been working on my company for several years now to the point where it is \"the biggest in the world\" albeit in a very small niche. We still have a _long_ way to go.  \n\nBut by mid-way through last year it started catching up with me. I wasn't spending enough time with friends. My relationship with my wife was becoming fairly bad, and I felt physically and mentally tired all the time.  \n\nWe're not machines. And not everybody is the same. Some people can be amazing entrepreneurs without any of the things that people like Gary talk about. He's just one type of entrepreneur. Look at guys like Phil Knight, the founder of Nike. He could barely look people in the eye when talking to them when he started that company. Incredibly socially awkward loner. My point is that we all have different needs and we all work best in different ways.  \n\nI started doing things like taking days off mid-week to unplug. When doing that my mind would often come up with solutions on its own that I likely wouldn't have been able to come up with if I was at my desk beating myself up.  \n\nI'll also sometimes take a notebook and just disappear to a private place like a coffee shop or a park and started writing down some of the issues I'm trying to tackle and let the thoughts all go down on the page until I've distilled them into a sensible strategy.  \n\nI've also started asking for way more help. There's this belief out there that you should be able to do everything yourself by sheer force of will. It's just not true. I appreciate the saying \"If you're the smartest person in the room then you're in the wrong room.\" It's true. You have to remind yourself that nobody is great at everything. It's easy to get really down on yourself when you believe that you should be. Identify your strengths and then find help in the areas you're not as strong in. Admit when you're stuck or you don't know the next step. Get advice from people you respect and trust.  \n\nAt the end of the day remember that we're all only here for a little blip of time. Ask yourself if you're happy with how you're spending yours.",

You can't force it, you have to give it the space to bloom and often as founders its us standing in the way by micromanaging everything and going around as stress bubbles. It normally takes a long time to learn to delegate. Wish you all the best.",

Gary Fucking Vee and all the other cunts have teams of people and got a financial kickstart so can afford to preach to everyone.\n\nDon't fall for it.\n\nSet your own realistic expectations, and look after your physical and mental self, because no other cunt will.\n\nNever be afraid of making money, and hive some off for helping others - use that as a business hook and marketing angle too if you want, and look after Staff that are invested as you in your idea and business.\n\nAnd then spunk up dough on hookers, blow, rock climbing or whatever *THE* fuck floats your boat to give you some joy and rev.\n\nSource: me. I'm a grizzled fuck who has setup multiple businesses and been there, done a lot of what you have/are experiencing.\n\nHappy to talk if you're feeling lost or shiite.\n\nNate.",

He spent his youth learning business from things like buying and selling baseball cards, and he was making shit tons of money from that until he was forced to work at the liquor store for minimum wage.  Then when he took over advertising for the store, he wasn't handed anything, he was basically hired the same way a company can hire him today to provide advertising.  And when he left to start his own company, he didn't take any of that with him, and he started his advertising company out of the board room of another business.\n\nYa'll act like he was given a million dollars and told to go have fun with it, instead of growing up the son of Eastern European immigrants.  Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.",

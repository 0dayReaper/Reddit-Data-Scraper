    "postText": "I was thinking today about a concept for a coffee chain that would be a low overhead, high volume,   and lower cost relative to Starbucks. If anyone here has been in the Northwest, there are these drive through only coffee chains that only have 1 or 2 people in there and operate a very efficient and fast coffee service. So I was thinking what if you could make this into a booth that you can bring into large retailer stores like Walmart, where you sell good coffee with a streamlined menu. You could collect data from Walmart about the types of coffee people buy to customize for that location. This booth would be near the front so there would be a lot of foot traffic. Walmart would like this because you could give them a cut and it would improve their store experience without having to take up too much space. Target already has Starbucks in there and maybe other retailers might want coffee that is more tailored to their customers. This would be good for my business concept because we don't have to worry about real estate and we would have demand generated by being in a high foot traffic area. What are your guys thoughts on this concept?",

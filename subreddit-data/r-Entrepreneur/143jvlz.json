    "postText": "I everyone, I'm starting a jewelry business and would like some feedback on the idea. My store is based around simple/minimalistic zircon jewelry. Simple is in the name so I'm trying to have everything from the store layout, design, typography, and color be simple but elegant like the jewelry. Main audience is young women. I already have some samples coming in the mail and just need to order custom jewelery boxes and pouches to make it more professional and to give the customer a great experience. The main thing I am prioritizing is customer service.\n\nAny advice, recommendations, and tips on anything business starup wise or in general would be great thank you!",

            "comment": "When you say store, I assume you mean website or are you talking brick and mortar? If you are talking website, you have a challenge ahead of you. You've got some pretty big guys as competition. If you are talking B&amp;M, let me know, I have other advice for you there. \n\nBut I do like your \"simple\" idea. Build on it and make it your trademark. 3 basic colors and block font. Point our to your customers that you want to keep it simple and fun for them. No hidden agenda or shady tricks up your sleeve. FAST service. Use USPS if you are in US to keep your costs down. Try to add a freeby or a bonus if you can. Special gift box? Do you have a local artist that does jewelry that you could add some of theirs in to broaden your SEO? Don't forget to build and monitor your google. Who is doing your website? If you, know how to do the little things to make it good. And with that, how about listing wedding sites/venues or related on yours? Maybe a page with \"Favorite love songs\" or \"Fav love poems.\" Things to get people to your site besides just searches for \"jewelry.\"",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the feedback, I plan on doing just a website for now and haven't thought about brick and morter yet. For the jewelry box I am planning to get small drawer like cardboard boxes with my logo and store name stamped in gold foil along with a small pouch with just my logo as a bonus so they can keep it in good condition. For those two things I am outsourcing from aliexpress and alibaba.\n\nI am proficient in website building and already have a shopify store finished with everything seo optimized for my niche. I'm just waiting for the jewelry so I can get professional photos for the home page and products and then start marketing it.\n\nAnd what do you mean wedding sites/venues? Are you talking about starting a blog?",

People who are looking for rings are looking for wedding venues, wedding gowns, tuxes, flowers and such. How/what can you have on your site to draw them to you that relate? You have mega competition. What is going to set you apart? When you say your already seo optimized it makes me shudder. It is like saying you are done. That should be daily or at least a weekly thing. You are optimized for today. Tomorrow 200 new shops go online that are optimized worldwide. What keeps you toward the top? I don't mean to sound negative but it is fierce. I'm in the art business with primarily a brick and mortar and a small portion of online. And online work takes more time vs sales than B&amp;M vs sales. In other words, I spend much more time to make a thousand $ online than I do to sell a thousand $ art in person.  I do not have a solution, I am only telling you what I have learned over the past 7 years. Granted, selling small jewelry is different than selling one of a kind art but either way, online competition is a fight just like it has been with the little guy vs Walmart or Sears back in the day but now it is us versus the world.",

Follow their socials. Get on their email lists. \n\nIf you can, why not reach out and see if you can talk to the owners and get their advice on where/how to start, what they wish they'd done differently if starting over again... etc.\n\nThis is where most of your best data &amp; insights will come from before you have customers, IMO",

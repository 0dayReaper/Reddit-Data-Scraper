    "postText": "I have started a mobile app company. Though I am not a programmer (though I\u2019m learning very slowly). I hired someone to write my code and my app is now live on both iOS and Android (6 weeks live). I am ready to take the next step in my app. Though it is struggling (mostly due to design and limitations on its ability). I am ready to start the next version but don\u2019t have the resources for my business to afford a new stage of development and been urged by well meaning family members to push my current (ok\ud83d\ude2a version first to raise money). My next thought process is to find investors but while I have a product it sucks and has little to show so far and feels like a near impossible task. My next thought was to look to merge with a similar business to allow for more growth as a business and an entrepreneur.",

    "postText": "About a year ago, I graduated with a PhD in a social science but decided to move away from academia. I got a job in a small (~60 employees) market research company, which hired me for my research skills, ability to conduct interviews, knowledge of different relevant fields, etc.\n\nHowever, once I started taking on different tasks, I found myself creating new and better tools to conduct them. They usually involved Excel sheets and VBA, which I've been able to use with my programming skills, which are significantly higher than the average person but not sufficient to call myself a programmer or apply for software jobs. \n\nQuickly, I got a reputation for being the Excel guy in the company and built tools for other teams and the organization as a whole. In one case, my tool saved dozens of researcher hours. In another, it changed how we estimate costs. As a contextual side note, I'm also getting into AI for the workplace and learning more every day. \n\nSo, I've been mulling over the idea of doing the same type of automation tasks as a consultant for other small companies. I'd offer a package of auditing process to identify automation opportunities, designing a strategy to implement them, and supervise and support that implementation.\n\nI've been using ChatGPT to get some ideas on how to get started: defining my target, the service I'll offer, etc. But, I'd love some advice from fellow humans. So, what steps do you think I should take?\n\nThanks in advance!",

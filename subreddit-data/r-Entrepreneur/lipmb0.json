Just to throw something out there, have 20 phone conversations with your target audience. Until you do that you'll have no fucking idea what the product needs to do for your customers.\n\nNext, follow the lean startup model.\n\n1. Build (your minimally viable product. Don't be a perfectionist because you're scared of the next step.)\n\n2. Test it. (validate it in the market. Do people buy it. Measure)\n\n3. Pivot. (is the idea shit? Pivot to a new one and restart from step 1. Is the idea okay but needs improvement? Change it - and restart from step 1)\n\n\nEdit: smarter and more successful people than me are suggesting alternate (\"better\") approaches than the Lean Startup Method:\n\n- Jobs To Be Done Framework\n\n- Peter Thiel's ideas\n\n- This thing: https://howdo.com/training/",

We should have just released it as-is to get our foot into the market, get customer feedback,  and make improvements accordingly. Looking back, I do think we were scared of failing so we kept delaying release by trying to get everything perfect. JUST DO IT.",

They make a saas platform for managing sim based iot devices. The challenge in the mvp model is that the market already had entrants in it doing rate plan optimization, so the customer feedback was all rooted in that experience.\n\nAfter a bit, they realized that anomaly detection, having a single universal api across hundreds of carriers and data capture from the carrier without bandwidth costs was far more valuable and applied to SD-WAN and Satellite as well as SIM/mobile iot. \n\nTheir deal size exploded from 50k to 500k average and the cash machine turned on.\n\nTL;DR don\u2019t stop at the first energy band of customer problems that your competitor defined, find bigger problems you can defend.",

                    "comment": "My grad program was based around the book The Lean Startup, so we said \"fail fast\" a lot.  Another deeper lesson from a teacher that I really appreciated was, essentially, to always be making money.  Meaning don't just spend money on research in the name of spending money on developing test batches in the name of paying people to tell you what they think about the product you've already spent all of this money on.  People often speak more honestly with their dollars, anyway.  Anybody will take your money and tell you if they like your product or not; some would say they might be more inclined to like it if they're being paid to try it, too.  Thus, the ability to actually sell what you're doing is kind of always the most important KPI; I know that sounds dated, but I don't mean it like my dad might say, \"always be closing\", or, \"time is money,\" or anything.  Sales are about influencing decision making by convincing people to buy something, though, so buying opinions can possibly lead to unreliable data when it comes to actually making sales, let alone wasting money on unproductive research.\n\nOne tactic I've grown to love along my professional journey is incentivized feedback.  Let them make the decision to buy the product, but include a coupon code to take a survey that gives you the next round free or discounted.  As you point out, you can always improve along the way.  In fact, even the oldest most consistent well-branded products go through changes (Coca-Cola's infamous formula experiments, clothing manufacturers offshoring manufacturing, etc., not to say it's all bad but companies do tend to be more concerned with cost over quality once they reach a certain size).  The important thing is that you don't just have to fail fast, you can actually make money failing that you'll need to pay for iterations &amp; pivots.  The more accurate and encompassing your data is, the better choices you'll make iterating.  Early customers are often the most loyal in the long run, as well, especially those who were willing to participate in feedback programs.  Incentivizing feedback is a really potent strategy at all stages of brand &amp; product development.",

I dropped out of school in 5th grade and decided to study every person, role and reason of each position in each company as I worked. \n\nWhen I started mine I was working for a diesel repair shop in a \"squirrel's role\" where I did everything. I took them from $250k revenue a year 1 bay shop to 28 bays $8M year rev,with 5 other companies (all over $1M rev within 5.5 years. Along the way the owners failed to give me equity or promised pay increases, limited my commissions and such.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a repair idea I saw some major dealerships doing with quick turn around and set profits. I pitched the owners and they said build it. I did and got nothing. One day I was curious on why parts were so high and realized there would be a long shot opportunity. I told everyone that would listen and they all laughed at me. Millions of reasons I was wrong and would fail and if I was right how could I make a fortune on a $0.46 part? I sold the largest OEM factories, dealerships in the world and now I cold call every repair shop in America. This year we are taking over the world. I expanded and we have 5 factories now. China, Taiwan, Serbia, Mexico, and USA. We also grew and now manufacture 7 different parts in 26 sizes and 3 materials. I've built everything myself, have an equity investor that just put in money, and a part time warehouse person. I just call, call, call...except this week. I just finished reconciling the books and sent them to the CPA. This is the last time I do it, I've hired an accounting person that starts in March, a nanny for 2 days a week and a sales guy to take some of my calling.\n\n4 going into 5 years and I knew it would be hard but I also was hoping I'd get bought by now. My wife and I are setting up multiple other Ventures under are holding company and are going to start creating various passive income streams through real estate, storage buildings, RV parks, and car washes.\n\nThere are thousands of customers I've gotten one request from almost every one of them so I started researching it and realized there's another part that goes on all vehicles that has been cornered by two major manufacturers and there is so much margin to be made. I can't say much more because they could crush me financially and I'm only going to go after the commercial truck segment of the market because it fits in with my current inventory. This time I have Capital though so I can start out buying millions of pieces of each item and I have a customer base (60+% us market) so I think it's going to work. The bad part is I've already done the exciting stuff which is build the customer base and raised the capital funding the idea was a little bit of luck. Having the balls to go after it is something but just not as excited about this as I would have been 4 years ago. I'm still going to pursue it because I like to win. I know I'll be saving little guy lots of money my goal is 50%. These parts are not going to make the same type of money as the ones I currently do but the volume will be a hundred times what I currently do. The challenge with that is expanding warehousing and all the babysitting that'll come with employees and I really don't want that. Right now I have enough teenage and adult children that I can fill roles as needed.",

I find factories that specialize in the processes and the materials that I need and then I vet them for their ISO certifications and such, and then just reach out to them. Every once in awhile you get a dud but more often than not if you stick to what you're looking for you just don't get too excited you can find great factories. I work for a brass fittings company and the guy told me I'll pay you $2,000 a month to work in my warehouse in find the thing that will push us over 10 million dollars a year. Oh my bills were $5,000 a month so I had to mow a lot of Lawns while I work that crappy Warehouse. One day I stumbled across a compression air brake fitting. I opened up the fitting and it fell apart and I just thought this is stupid there has to be a better way and I found a push to connect brass air brake fitting. The owner said they're way too expensive no one really trusted them and they've never really taken off because one company parker-hannifin controls that industry. Given this is 20 years ago so I start searching on the internet as best I can and I find a brass Factory in China and Taiwan I send all the fittings I could buy to them and we rebuild them and it took 5 years and half a million dollars but we got them third party and d o t certified. We were the first certified brass push to connect air brake fitting manufacturer and the United States and we took over every Market. Our cost was pennies in our competitions cost was around or over $1.\n\nWe took over the Frac sand tank trailer Market, Car Wash manufacturers globally, pressure wash hackanything with pressure and water, Trucking, and one of the biggest was the Intermodal chassis Market millions and millions of chassis replacing these fittings every couple months. They sold the company screwed me over I lost almost everything we ate at food banks I think I had four five kids at the time and it eventually led to my divorce.\n\nThat factory in the relationship I built setting it up connected me to a lot of the raw material producers worldwide and that in turn led to more factories in various Industries as I went to different companies in different Industries. The key is I always kept these contacts close to my vest that way it was my contact. So when the time came to do this I had a general understanding of the materials in the process is and multiple factories that I had run millions of dollars of various business through previous jobs and that gave me enough cloud that they would work with me. I still had to pay for everything 50% upfront 50% of bill of lading all tooling and dies had to be paid for up-front and minimum piece counts were in place of 10000 to 50,000 pieces. We're in the millions now.\n\n\nYou don't own a factory though you just find a factory and do business with it. A diversified from China and Taiwan because I believe World War 3 will be with China probably in my lifetime. Mexico with a given because I live in Texas it's about 10% higher manufacturing costs but I don't have to pay at 28.5% tariff or a 4% steel tariff or the duties and taxes that I pay with China and Taiwan and the lead time is 30 days instead of 90 120 days. Also there's a lot of commercial truck manufacturers in Mexico and they need my parts. I haven't traveled internationally yet with this business mainly because we've been Food Bank Brock doing it I got fired three years in with my job found out that I was building something on the side and it made them mad. What's 8 of my 10 kids still living at home a nasty divorce that's cost me a fortune and starting life over at 40 years old living in a 30 foot camper with no phone no car no computer and starting this company it's been a hard Road. That stuff is 2020 was it was our break out and now things are getting very interesting.\n\nThe craziest part is I brought manufacturing back to California of all places for the casting to dynacast a German company and it's a few pennies less per item then it cost to make them in China and it's a better quality product and the tooling is guaranteed for Lifetime instead of couple million pieces. Now the tooling cost $185,000 vs $20,000 in China. But with our volume and the turnaround time we made up that cost in 2 months.\n\nOkay I got to go read bedtime stories I've been doing voice to text so if the grammar is messed up with the wordings messed up I apologize I've got lots of little kids to put to bed. Anyone that's looking to manufacture though don't think that you have to own a factory now as your business grows maybe you start in your garage or storage building far as your inventory goes eventually you can grow bigger and bigger to a bigger space Maybe build a metal building in the country is cheaper than renting something in the city you have to factor in lead times with the shipping companies look at all kinds of things but the factory is the easy part. Now all factories will probably sell your product out the back door but who cares competitions competition even if it's with yourself you can still win.",

You can figure out who those people were using Google and then use import Yeti to find their factories. I would not say by from their Factory but most factories cluster. So if you find one in Ningbo there's probably 5 in Ningbo. Does that make sense I hope that helps. I don't have any contacts directly for those type of Parts but you could find the factories and then email them directly. If you're going to be buying parts from China you going to have to buy in quantity this is not Alibaba where you can buy five pieces you need to look at buying hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands. Obviously you'll start smaller and ramp up but you won't have any real leverage unless you stretch yourself a bit. This is good though it makes you find out if your business is legitimate before it even starts because you'll have to go out and make some sales before you ever buy.

Find a company that manufactures items with the same materials or processes....casting zinc, stamping or machining steel, electronics, textiles......\n\n\n\nWhen I start searching for factories 20 years ago we didn't have that we had to use zeapole or one of those Bill of lading search tools which are the same thing as import yeti but it was very expensive so I would use the free trial for 24 hours and I would search the hell out of stuff.\n\n\nI've never had anyone on the ground confirm the legitimacy of a factory or look at quality control. Imma burn the boat kind of personality I grew up on my own on the street I was sponsored surfing and rock-climbing I did a lot of big wall climbing in Yosemite Squamish Chief Mexico Norway.....\n\nI just did my own due diligence until I felt the risk was low enough to dump 50 Grand or $100,000 order on them and hope like hell it got here safely. There's a million other steps involved with manufacturing overseas and importing especially depending on what country you're in when you get to that stage let me know on a private message and I'll walk you through some connections that I have and some experiences.",

Your landing page that only got 5 signups is not M, V, or P - you've just been testing a tagline and your own marketing skills.\n\n\\- Understand how to have phone conversations with people - 20 phone conversations with people can be great, but if every conversation is, \"Hey, I have this idea, what do you think?\", you will get terrible data.  You have to make sure you understand the problem you are solving, not validating your solution\n\n\\- Pivoting - Riding a bad idea into the ground is obviously a bad idea, but I think most founders don't have any idea when to pivot, even folks who have experience previously with startups.  You have to really understand whether you've misestimated the M, the V, or the P.  If it's the M or the V, you can iterate.  Did you misunderstand the problem? Well then you messed up my bullet point above.\n\nJust my .02 from a lot of experience with this.",

It *could* stand on its own, but the big business growth comes from scaling it. \n\nIn some instances getting 5 people to put down hard cash on a pre-order is good enough.

In effect, you need to make the conversation about what are the things someone is trying to accomplish throughout their day.   You want to look for JTBD that have a lot of friction in the process. \n\nExample:\n\n\"Every day when I get in, I open my email and I look for emails that are requiring my attention so I know what my day looks like\" - the JTBD is \"I want to understand what I need to unblock today\" \n\n\"I don't have a social media manager, so I have to keep checking reviews, tweets, yelp, so I can see what people are saying about me\" - the JTBD is \"I want to see and engage with what people are saying about me online\"\n\nOf the two of these, which do you think you might have an opportunity to solve?  Potentially both, but the second one seems higher value - the interviewer identifies that they don't have someone to do this, and then describes a high-friction process.  There's also the mom test, which allows you to understand whether someone needs a solution to a problem, or they don't care enough for it to matter.",

In my experience the landing page is basically a form of market research, but it more often tests your marketing funnel and your copy than people's willingness to pay.  If you have a product that you can give to people and then they give you money for, that's potentially viable.\n\nThe opposite is also true - what if you have an amazing idea for a product, but you're just not very good at the landing page?  You get no interest, you pivot, and you missed a huge opportunity.\n\nI think one of my broader objections to the lean startup approach is that a lot of people interpret it as \"idea-&gt;landing page-&gt;test-&gt;assess-&gt;pivot\" - and that's a terrible way to test an idea.  Do you know what a good response rate is?  What if you have a 50% conversion rate and 0 of them want to pay?  What if you have a .02% conversion rate, but it turns out that they each have 400k to spend with you?\n\nWe see posts on these and the other startup forums ALL THE TIME for people who say \"I got 800 signups on my landing page and I built the product and none of them have signed up\".  Yeah, that's because the landing page is often, not always, but mostly, more about measuring your ability to get people to put their email address in a text box than it is about your value proposition.",

Not founders. The proof is in the 95% failure rate of startups. This allows investors to test the specific value proposition you put forth while ensuring they get their money out before real investment is required.\n\nIt behooves all entrepreneurs to ensure they build a successful business. Successful businesses:\n\n* grow revenue\n* reduce operating costs\n* mitigate risk\n* empower employees\n* delight customers\n\nYou cannot hope to figure all this out once you get into market.\n\nThere is a minimum amount of due diligence that every entrepreneur should do before approaching the market with a solution. Talking to customers is never enough. You must choose a beachhead customer that you will orient your product around. Then, you must also conduct a thorough competitive analysis, market analysis and technical analysis. Once you have this information, you need to validate if your business is - in fact - a business. That starts figuring out if your LTV/CAC (or whatever KPI is critical to your P&amp;L) is going to be viable by using market comps.\n\nIf you think this is \"analysis paralysis\" then you are intellectually lazy and not diligent enough to succeed in a hyper-competitive and hyper-saturated business marketplace.  E.G.: there are 879,000 members of this sub. Not to mention hundreds of millions of wantrepreneurs in the marketplace. Those with the best plan wins.\n\nMy advice on building a plan:\n\n1. Identify the beachhead customer\u2019s problem(s)\n2. Learn who is currently solving your beachhead customer\u2019s problem(s); these are your competitors\n3. Learn the market surrounding your beachhead customer; this is the context in which your business will operate\n4. Using your knowledge of the customer, their problems, your competition and the market; design value proposition(s) that uniquely and defensibly solves the beachhead customer\u2019s problem(s)\n5. Develop a plan on how you will test the value proposition(s) with the beachhead customer\n6. Test the value proposition(s) with your customer with lofi prototypes - not MVP\n7. Iterate the value proposition(s) to ensure it solves the beachhead customer\u2019s problem\n8. Repeat testing and iteration until you\u2019re confident your solution solves the beachhead customer\u2019s problem(s) = product/market fit\n9. Build a team to support your iteration and scaling\n10. If necessary, raise capital to support scaling the team, iterating the solution and expanding to solve new problems for the same customer, or new problems for new customers.",

I think the really great companies did something that was somewhat more of a quantum improvement that really differentiated them from everybody else. They typically did not do massive customer surveys, the people who ran these companies sometimes, not always, suffered from mild forms of Aspergers, so they were not actually that influenced, not that easily deterred, by what other people told them to do. I do think we're way too focused on iteration as a modality and not enough on trying to have a virtual ESP link with the public and figuring it out ourselves.\n\nI would say the risk question is always a very tricky one, because it's often the case that you don't have enough time to really mitigate risk. If you're going to take enough time to figure out what people want, you often will have missed the boat by then. And then of course there is always the risk of doing something that's not that significant or meaningful. You could say that a track in law school is a low risk track from one perspective, but it may still be a very high risk track in the sense that maybe you have a high risk of not doing something meaningful with your life. We have to think about risk in these very complicated ways. I think risk is this complicated concept.",

I agree this will work with a really well done MVP, but there is no perfect formula for entrepreneurship.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna open a pizza store, do you really need to bug 20 people on a phone to \u201cvalidate\u201d the idea ?\n\nDo you need to start serving cardboard shit pizza to \u201cvalidate\u201d the idea ? If anything the negative feedback will discourage you.\n\nLean startup only works for things that are completely unproven like \u201cpeople will want to buy purple goo\u201d or some extremely cutting edge technology. Or if you wanted to do something innovative like serve people fried chicken eyeballs. \n\nIf people are already buying what you want to build (pizza, payroll software, carpets, personal training, alcohol, banking services). People WILL buy your product as long as your service is good. If you truly believe you can build a rockstar pizza, people WILL flock to you. It\u2019s already a proven market from the last 100 years.\n\nThink about it logically too. If you heard there was a new pizza store in town with the craziest fuckin pizza, what are you gonna do ? \n\nUhh try it obviously.",

If you come out in a competitive market or you're selling high-value items with a shitty MVP because you misconstrue MVP to mean low-effort, low-build, low-design, you will likely not see results and lose motivation to keep going (speaking from my own experience).\n\nI feel like the way this subreddit talks about MVPs leaves readers believing they can throw shit at a wall in existing markets and somehow if it doesn't stick that there just isn't room for a new product or service, which is a farce.",

You still need to pull capital together to put up the pizza shop. It doesn't succeed. You can't pivot, you just go out of business and all your grub stake with it.

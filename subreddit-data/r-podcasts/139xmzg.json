    "postText": "I know - which class? Which group of women within that society? It\u2019s broad. But are there any podcasts whose subject is women as a whole over different periods? Not specific individuals. A bit like how with some podcasts or books you\u2019ll get \u201chistory of middle ages\u201c as a broader topic. or \u201chistory of china.\u201d so something that could be considered that kind of thing but women\u2019s history? I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s a specific period or place as long as it gets into broader details than just one life!",

The format and personalities I really loved. \nI know David had gone on to do \u2018let\u2019s wing it\u2019 but I feel like it\u2019s not quite there \n\nSome others either don\u2019t have the personality, or only (primarily) cover older movies\n\nI have tried rewatchables, unspooled, big picture and small bits of others \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated !",

They are done by the same 3 people and are the best film breakdown podcasts out there. Even the movies I don\u2019t care for turn out to be hilarious episodes. Paige, Mikey and Todd have amazing chemistry and make everything they do fun.",

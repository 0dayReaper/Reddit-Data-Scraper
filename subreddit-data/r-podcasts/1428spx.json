On the other hand some hosts won\u2019t play a a single note of a song because they\u2019ll get in (I assume DMCA) trouble and lose monetization. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m pretty sure that A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs hasn\u2019t cleared the 100\u2019s of songs/clips he uses. What gives?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "[Fair Use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/) copyright doctrine is the root of this. \n\nOn a larger scale, fair use is a defense of use, meaning that if a podcast were to be sued by a songwriter for using their material, they could claim Fair Use as a defense. But as you'll see in the webpage I linked, Fair Use is subjective so they could still be sued for using copyrighted music. The context, scale of the podcast, and amount of use is important for determining the risk behind using copyrighted music. For example, I have not listened to A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs, but per its title it is likely educational, which gives them a good defense for using copyrighted material. If they're only playing short clips of songs, it's hard for artists to claim the podcast is impacting their sales of those songs. On the other hand, if a podcast used most or all of a copyrighted song just as an interlude, they do not have a good claim for Fair Use, especially if they are a large highly-distributed podcast with a lot of ad income. In that case, it's easy for the artist to point at the podcast and say \"these people are profiting off my music,\" and successfully sue them. \n\nIt's possible that podcasts using music clips (or audio clips from other sources like films and television) *are* violating copyright, but because podcasts are distributed in many different ways across many platforms, and many podcasts have a small audience, it's difficult to catch. A small podcast distributed independently using a copyrighted song as their theme song is unlikely to be sued, even if they are violating copyright, because it's probably not worth it for the artist.",

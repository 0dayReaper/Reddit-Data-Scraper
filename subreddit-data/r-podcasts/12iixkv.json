                    "comment": "Overcast\u2019s handling of new episodes (or rather more episodes) added to the list of unplayed is mess right now. \n\nIt depends on whether new is on top or old and sometimes I am not even sure what it depends on. So maybe it just keeps adding episodes as long as there are unplayed ones. Which is shitty. There\u2019s no control. \n\nAnyway, so you see if you go to any episode and press that \u201ccheckmark in round circle\u201d (\u201cmark as played\u201d feature) button  \u2014 if I go to to any episode and mark it played even before it\u2019s added to \u201cavailable to play\u201d list (ie new episodes list \u2014 which is weird because even old episodes keeps coming as you finish up previously added episodes) then it doesn\u2019t get added. \n\nSo let\u2019s say there\u2019s a podcast P and it has episodes E1 to E100 as of today. Now let\u2019s consider I have listened upto 30th episode 70 are still remaining. And at this point I don\u2019t want episodes after 30 added to my list \u2014 I want only new episodes added (new as in ones released after \u201ctoday\u201d and not the ones from the past 70 already released but unplayed by me). But overcast keeps adding from those 70 episodes unless I go to every 70 of them and \u201cmark them as played\u201d (checkmark button) - all 70 of them!!! I hate having to do this!! Overcast build \u201cmark them played\u201d after years of \u201cheavy demand\u201d \u2014 yup that basic feature \u2014 so I think if at all this \u201cmark all as played\u201d  is ever built it will take maybe a decade and a half. \n\nSome of my podcasts have 100s of old episodes. \n\nAnyway kind of a tl;dr of what I want is:\n\n1.\tA flag to toggle for a podcast that adds only newly released episodes (as in released after that day) to be added to that list of unplayed episodes which is called \u201cCurrent\u201d on overcast - no matter in what order I have sorted my Current and All for that podcast. \n2.\tAnd also a way to \u201cmark all episodes of  podcast as played\u201d at any given time if all I want are only new episodes. \n\nI think 2 alone will solve my problem, but 1 is very important \u2014 because if I use 2 then I won\u2019t be able to go back to podcast and see what all I have not listened to maybe manually check some out because I have marked them all played. But if 1 is difficult I won\u2019t mind just having 2. Beats having to mark every single episode as played. \n\nwould you scaring few things about your app?\n\n-\tIs your app a native app? Or electron etc?\n-\tis it iOS only?\n-\tis it open source by any chance?\n-\tis it going to be pay for download or subscription? \n-\twhat are the export and import options? \n-\tyou\u2019re using a an established third party sync like iCloud, dropbox etc or implemented yet another proprietary custom sync like Overcast has done? Or if you have  done your own then does it follow any common public spec?\n-\twhat data do you collect?",

There aren't as many \"glossy\" productions of this type because its not advertiser-friendly and so it's mostly a stroke of luck to find any productions that tickle that particular itch..\n\nI'm not really looking for stuff like Cumtown which I'm sure people will recommend me but stuff more akin to \"Gosspimongers\" which was a british podcast where they commented on weird gossip stories sumitted by their audience.",

I can be listening to a podcast in the morning before work and get everything I want queued up on my desktop for the day and not have to worry about anything other than basically start/stop on my phone throughout the day.  \n\nI paid a flat $9 (I think) initially for Plus years ago, and seem to be grandfathered in. Or there's a glitch where I just haven't been charged anything since then. Either way, I'm very used to using it. And the bonus for me is that the initial $9 I paid was free money via Google Rewards. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure I'd still be using it with these kind of price increases.",

My primary contention is that rewards seem to 'time out' - meaning that if you don't use a particular reward in X amount of time, it expires.  \n\nMy rewards account generally hangs out at around $20 or so. I use some for apps now and then, and also lose some just because I haven't used them in the required time-frame.   \n\nBut yeah, it's an awesome way to try new (paid) apps, and being willing to throw some of those credits towards fledgling apps has worked out well for me overall.   \n\nI hate seeing the Rewards expire, but if I don't have a use or compelling reason to 'spend' them on something I also don't see the point of using them for no reason.  \n\nOf course, typing that out, it made me realize that maybe spending some of those credits on newer or \"possibly\" more useful apps *for me* might be a better option than just letting them expire and benefit nobody other than Google sucking up that data.  \n\nYeah, I've just made a resolution to spend that app money if for no other reason than to benefit producers instead of the behemoth-information-sucking suckfest that is Google (though they already pretty much own my info, through every fault of my own).  \n\nThanks for encouraging me to re-think how I deal with the Rewards program.",

I have used it for ~4 years now, and it's been great!\n\nEdit - Oh also, \"folders\" are \"tags\" on Podcast Republic. Works pretty much the same I think (though you can put the same podcast under different tags, not sure if folders allow that)",

    "postText": "I used to listen to a podcast and I can't find it at all. It was about the entire world going unconscious. And when everyone woke up the people had been in a trance building things. One thing they built was a tower made of human teeth. The story follows a killer, I think he is called the family man, because he killed his family and made an axe out of his father's bones, and twin blades out of his sister's bones. The weapons can telepathically communicate with him. And the story follows him venturing this hell scape of a world, and all of the most prolific serial killers, all with their own back story and unique ways they kill, are all competing to be the top killer. If I remember correctly, his last battle I listened to was against a guy named Jack that cut people's heads off and turned them into jack-o-lanterns as his calling card. I can't find it anywhere. It's driving me nuts. Thanks!",

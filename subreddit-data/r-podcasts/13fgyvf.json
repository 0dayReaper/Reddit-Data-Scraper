    "postText": "Binge listened to the entirety of Jamie Bartlett's new podcast yesterday. Believe in Magic is a \"a dark and strange story of online deception\" and I got through all of it in one morning. All episodes are on BBC Sounds, and the first two are up on Apple Podcasts. Absolutely gripping, thorough and told with kindness. \n\nPerfect for documentary or investigative podcast fans - just as good as Cryptoqueen.",

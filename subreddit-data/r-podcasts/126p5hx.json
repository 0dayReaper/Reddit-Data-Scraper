    "postText": "So today on my morning commute, I started Google Podcast and resumed my play queue. About halfway through the podcast, a jarring ad played; it wasn't really normalized to the podcast volume and it was localized to my area, when it played I didn't think too much of it, I thought the podcast had changed up how they do ads. The normal format of the podcast is they'll do the podcast, do a quick bumper ad read by the host/narrator of the podcast, then a quick bonus bit, so when that happened, I knew Google had added their own ads, and this was confirmed when the next podcast had an ad play before the podcast.\n\nI'm looking for a podcast player that has a play queue, I don't want to have to manually play each podcast episode, or to only be able to automatically only that podcast. Free is always good, but I don't mind paying a bit for it.",

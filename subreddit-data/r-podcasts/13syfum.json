    "postText": "The Oppenheimer film by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight trilogy, Dunkirk, Inception, etc.), based on the book ~~Modern~~ American Prometheus, is coming next July and I'd like to listen to podcasts related to the Manhattan Project and the first atomic bomb.\n\nSo far I just found the following somewhat related podcasts:\n\n* The Bomb (First Season) about the very beginnings of the race to develop the atomic bomb but just mentions the Manhattan Project in one episode. \n* Revisionist History (old. limited, but very good series about the dropping of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima and Nagasaki)\n\nAny more recommendations please?",

Oodles of gratitude to anyone who ever recommended this, I shall file it away for a rainy day with the Belt Buckle episode of Mystery Show, under \u201cDare you to listen and not smile\u201d.",

I even found the lost song itself to be a bit of a catchy wee bop for a short spell after listening.\n\nOn the subject of pod episodes to bring a goofy grin, have you listened to:\n\n[Flight](https://themoth.org/stories/flight) a story of acrobatic and aeronautic baby salvation in this [episode](https://themoth.org/radio-hour/ski-poe-spa-and-towers) of the Moth. Always gives me a goofy smile\n\n[Gobi](https://thisislovepodcast.com/episode-24-gobi/) a story of perambulation and canine salvation from This is Love, so lovely especially if you are a dog/ animal person\n\n[Squirrel Cop](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/510/fiasco-2013/act-three-1) from This American Life, a story of sequential and increasingly funny rodent inspired disasters -- Keystone Cops meet Tom and Jerry. This one just a giggle, a real series of unfortunate events",

I suppose, like a Jan Robinson shirt or a car wash at Janthony's, high quality takes time. \n\nI do hope you get a giggle from those - Moth's \"Flight\" gives me a goofy grin, and Squirrel Cop just needs to be heard to be believed. It is from This American Life episode \"Fiasco\" which starts with an account of a most deliciously disastrous school theatre production of Peter Pan, a story which also repays a listen with a few good guffaws.",

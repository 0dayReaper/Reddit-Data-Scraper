Not really want something specifically deconstructing and debunking Christianity as a whole (that kinda stuff is boring to me lol) but I'm looking for more something that talks about how religious extremism effects people and western culture. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "**The Paranoid Strain** covers various conspiracy theory stuff, religious extremism shows up *a lot*. Deep dives on single topics. The new Q anon season has a lot in it.\n\n**Qanon Anonymous** covers Qanon and related phenomena, but it's a weekly show and more current than Paranoid Strain. Has a *lot* of useful info. \n\n**Fever Dream** is basically QAA done as a radio news magazine by the Daily Beast.\n\n**Bundyville** and **Bundyville: the Remnant** cover the Bundy clan and get into the hyper-right version of Mormon extremism they believe in. The remnant also heads up to n Idaho and looks in on related neo-nazi/christian identity movements based there. \n\n**The Right Podcast** is a YouTube show/podcast that does *very* deep dives on specific far right subject matter each show. Absolutely essential show for understanding a lot of this stuff. Presented in a dense but clear manner that respects your time. \n\n**Behind the Bastards** has a bunch of episodes on the subject, as does their sister show **It Could Happen Here**\n\nFor funsies, there's **The Scathing Atheist**, **Skeptocrats**, and **Cognitive Dissonance**. All comedy shows directly dedicated to covering religious lunacy. Also links in to a bunch of other more serious shows in the same vein. \n\n**Conspirituality** focuses more on the New Age/wellness guru side of things. \n\n**I Don't Speak German** focuses more on secular-ish nazis, but those worlds intersect heavily, so still a good resource.\n\n. . .okay. my lunch break is over, but I'll keep adding to the list as time permits.\n\nUpdate 1\n\n**Knowledge Fight** covers Alex Jones. . .exhaustively. They've been at it for 6 years and 800 plus episodes, so there is a *ton* of material, but. . .Alex is probably the number one vector of christian extremism into the mainstream over the last 20 years or so, and the KF boys are all over it. Host Dan Friesen is also a master class in ethics unto himself, which comes through as you listen. The reddit sub is also quite helpful and active.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n**Leaving Eden Podcast**. Just found this one on this thread and, holy smokes, this is perfect. I've been looking for a narrative history show focused on evangelicals and this is it.",

For example, Ted Gunderson shows up as an early funder for Infowars/Alex Jones on Knowledge Fight. Well, turns out he was also a *huge* driver of Satanic Panic bs in the 80s and 90s, which shows up on Paranoid Strain.",

The first episode was about Waco, and the wild thing I didn\u2019t know about that is that\u2019s where Alex Jones got his start. The most recent episode was about how Bill Cooper and Rush Limbaugh basically pushed all these fringe far right theories onto Fox News. \n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of religious exploration, which is what you want, but the extremism is DEFINITELY there. \n\nThe sound on it is REALLY good, too. It\u2019s made by Campside, which puts out some really awesome pods. The host is Garrett Graff. He has done a ton of stuff on 9/11. The podcasts first season was on that.",

He's incredibly frank and honest with his experiences and calls out bullshit everywhere he sees it. ;) Can't recommend enough!

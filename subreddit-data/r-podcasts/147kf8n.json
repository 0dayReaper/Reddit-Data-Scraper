    "postText": "I love podcasts! If you're reading this then I would assume that you do too. I love a good mystery, thriller, definitely fiction, and of course true crime. A couple of my regular podcasts just stopped and I'm hoping it's just an end of season thing, maybe you guys will have an answer that I don't. \n\nBridgewater. Absolute all time favorite. But it has stopped mysteriously \ud83e\udd14 10/10 highly recommend. Fantasy/fiction \n\nTagged. Very good regardless of what you may think at first. I was very surprised. 8/10 would give it a listen. Also suddenly stopped \ud83e\udd14 fiction but who knows...\n\nStrangeland. Probably my favorite true crime podcast. 10/10 go listen if you haven't. \n\n13 days of Halloween. Love it. 8/10. Fiction of course, provides a nice thrill \n\nThe NoSleep podcast. Let's end with a bang people it's a 10/10. Fiction. There are a couple episodes that I love so much and I cannot find them for the life of me! Maybe somebody knows how to help me figure out what story it is and what episode?? \n   The bus station one. Where they are stranded for so long and start eating each other. But it's really only been like 1 day when he gets out. What episode and what is the name of this story? \n   The one about the office workers having a virtual trivia. And the chic that is always getting \"shit on\" at work traps them in the chat and they have to listen to each other's secrets come out and at the end the lady had already killed herself. What episode and what is the name? \n\nSorry so long! Hahaha thanks in advance\n\nUPDATE**\nOh I forgot one lol the Mantawuak caves. I may have butchered that spelling. Another fiction. It starts slow but picks up. 7/10\n\nLet's talk about podcasts that we can't stand too! Is there one that totally sucks and I should avoid? For me I used to like Wine and Crime but something has shifted and I actually find it so annoying. Same with Crime Junkie.",

Plus the TC parts are always great but the two-host combo with two different stories keeps me hooked.",

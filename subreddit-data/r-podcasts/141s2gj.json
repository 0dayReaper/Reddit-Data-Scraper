    "postText": "I'm looking for a podcasts where complete strangers are interacting for the very first time in their lives, talking about casual things which then turn into talking about one another's lives or experiences which resulted in establishing good rapport between them. Reason for looking for such podcasts is mainly because to learn how to interact for the first time and build genuine long term friendship like for school, work i.e classmates who you see everyday, teachers, colleagues, etc. \n\nI gotta admit I don't know how to interact anymore hence I'm asking for such podcasts. I've read some books about it but I need real life interactions that I can listen to and learn from. Hopefully you could help me with this. Thank you in advance!",

It\u2019s nyc central but the premise seems to be meeting new people (primarily creatives) who are from all over the place. But you know it\u2019s also interesting if you have any knowledge of New York. Idk most the guests but they do seem to be getting real with strangers in a casual way that\u2019s, you know, real.",

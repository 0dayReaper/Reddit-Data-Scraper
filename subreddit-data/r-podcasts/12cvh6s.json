I'm looking for something in the style of History of Rome, History of England, History of Byzantium, etc.\n\nI see there is a French History Podcast.  Has anybody listened to this?  How do you find the accuracy and comprehensiveness of this Podcast to be?  Any other comments on it?\n\nAre there any others out there that I am missing?",

But of course by its very nature it is only going to cover a portion of the late eighteenth century in any great detail. But I\u2019m sure someone else might be able to other suggestions",

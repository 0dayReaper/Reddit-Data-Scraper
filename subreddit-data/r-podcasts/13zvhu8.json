Plus, I usually end up learning things whilst being entertained.",

I was making the sounds of a busy Victorian era street and realized it was totally devoid of human sound\u2019s besides footsteps. All the stock crowd effects are either too noisy or clearly American. So I was hoping to slip in some random conversations of passersby to fade in and out as if they\u2019re walking by.\n\nTL;DR: I want them for background sound effects, (not for commercial use)",

Some websites like This American Life and Criminal have their most popular episodes listed on their website, which I so wish all podcasts did that! It makes it so much better to start. News shows or sports shows, don't really make sense to listen to from the beginning. It's a current events kind of thing. But then audio dramas should be started at the beginning.",

If it\u2019s a yes, *then* I go back and start at the first. Some podcasts have a rough start, you know? So checking with the newest lets me verify the audio and all that work for me, and I can tolerate earlier, rougher episodes knowing that they will improve down the line. But if I start a show and it sounds like it\u2019s been recorded in a linen closet, I tend to give it a pass.",

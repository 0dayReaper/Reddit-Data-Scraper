I am sorry if this seems like a stupid thing to post, i just find myself bored and waiting for each new episode of hers. Thanks for all/ any of your suggestions!!!",

            "comment": "I haven't watched that, but I can't recommend Dark Histories enough. The host is a great storyteller, but one of my favorite parts is that he is more focused on telling the story than trying to crack jokes and be funny. \n\nI listened to a bunch of different podcasts looking for one that was about old dark stories but found a bunch of them to be hard to listen to. I listened to a few episodes of Dark Histories and then decided to go back and start from episode 1 because I was hooked. I'm on season 4 now!",

Ben's is a lot more monotone, less flair, but the stories are right up the same alley. Bailey tells the story like she's gossiping with a girlfriend which is also hilarious. I enjoy both,  but it depends on what OP is looking for, the content or the presentation.",

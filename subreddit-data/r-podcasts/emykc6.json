It\u2019s fine to ask for a review, but don\u2019t try to convince me what rating I should give you, especially if you\u2019re trying to bribe it out of listeners with a chance to win some merch or an offer from a sponsor.\n\nJust started listening to Crime Junkies and this just bugged me. Maybe I\u2019m in the unpopular view point of this and I\u2019m being too judgmental, but knowing that people were giving 5 stars for a product just at the chance to win something is not cool to me.",

It seems that would encourage people to rate and write a review without the requirement that it be a good review. I mean the only people who would take the time to write it would be people who like it since the prize is merch related to the podcast, but then you circumvent the bribery for stars dilemma.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been listening to history podcasts lately- specifically WWII but now moving to looking for some on the Americas before Europeans came and trampled everything. I\u2019m trying to find podcasts that are formatted like being told a story. For example I love Dan Snow\u2019s History Hit, but most of his episodes are more like interviews. I still learn a ton, but I LOVE when he does an episode by himself. I also love Cautionary Tales, In our Time, and Swindled. \n\nAny recommendations?",

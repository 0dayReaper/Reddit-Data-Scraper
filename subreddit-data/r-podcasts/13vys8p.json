    "postText": "I cannot remember this podcast or find it through googling. Hope someone can help me. \n\nI listened to an American podcast episode within the last couple of years that included an interview with a woman who thought she was helping the authorities investigate a scam. But the \"authorities\" were the real scammer. They had her spending her own money to buy stuff from the \"scammer\" almost as an undercover operative.\n\nI also remember that she got caught up in this and went to the bank to do some sketchy money transfers and the bank tried to warn her that it was a scam but she was too caught up in the moment to listen. I remember her discussing with the interviewer how weird that felt in retrospect.\n\nI think this was more of a general podcast than a true crime podcast (though I do listen to \"Criminal\".) \"This American Life\", \"Radiolab\", \"The Daily\", \"Reply All\", \"Planet Money\" - something like that. It was either one episode or part of one episode, not a series. (And I might be conflating two different podcast episodes in each of the top two paragraphs).\n\nThanks everyone!",

    "postText": "I work off the grid so often download audiobooks or podcasts to listen to while I'm working. A lot of the audio players I have found have no feature that saves my place so if I listen to a 3 hour audiobook or podcast for an hour it's hard to find where I've got to next time I come to finish listening to the rest.\n\nThis seems to be an issue with the players I have used on both PC and android.\n\nAre there any audio players that will save my place and start the podcast/audiobook where I left off? Similar to how audible does it.",

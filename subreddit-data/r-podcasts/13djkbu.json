Everything. Losing weight is all about being in a calorie deficit. There is no quick trick or fast track to losing weight. Burn more calories than you eat and you'll lose weight. If you work out you can burn more calories so you can eat more food, don't work out you can eat less food and still lose weight.\n\nGood luck, it's a long hard path but it works. Remember it's marathon and not a sprint. If some weeks you don't lose and you gain, stay motivated and get back at it. Don't be hard on yourself and work on one thing at a time, don't try and run before you can walk or you'll set yourself up for failure.",

But when you try to mention things like hormones, age, etc you're just told you're wrong and if you just count calories everything will be fine and you're probably doing it wrong. \n\nI had to nope out because it was really getting to me. Turns out, I'm in early menopause but according to the 20-something guys in loseit, it shouldn't matter lol (according to my doctor, it absolutely does but hey, what does she know?). \n\nI work with an amazing trainer now and with a better understanding of my body, have been slowing working through a recomp. It isn't the same as when I was in my 20's, but with the right POV it's been working much better.",

All of the research I've found says it's natural for that to happen. If it's 10-15 lbs. that's what's to be expected. Anything more then there could be other issues. I'm not thrilled about the weight I've gained but I'm still able to achieve my workouts and am actually stronger in some of my lifts so I just keep an eye on it and hope not to gain any more. I do definitely need to work on my diet. I used to be able to eat whatever I wanted but I think that's not the case anymore.",

I didn\u2019t cut any food groups out or make any food good or bad. \nI also don\u2019t really like exercise so I didn\u2019t go in with some mad gym regime that I knew I would never keep up. I walk regularly and I also do yoga once a week. \n\nIn contrast my friend lost the same amount of weight in a month by heavily restricting her diet and calories as well as having a mad gym regime and has put all her weight back on again and is now really disheartened. \n\nThere\u2019s a good podcast on bbc sounds about UPF food called \u2018a thorough examination with Drs Chris and Xand\u2019. I really liked it as they don\u2019t do the normal \u2018just have willpower and move more\u2019 trope they actually deconstruct how the big food companies have screwed us all over which I really liked as it\u2019s not just about having willpower.

Start off with Calories and as your weight loss slows down then I would advise going onto macros. Or if you're weight lifting or trying to build muscle, ones the gains slow down, go to macros.",

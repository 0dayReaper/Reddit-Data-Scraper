    "postText": "Hey folks\n\nThere\u2019s this podcast I used to listen to, totally forgot about it for years and I just can\u2019t remember the name of it for what ever reason. \n\nIt\u2019s American, in English. It was a call in type show? Maybe. And the guy would talk to one person for 1 hour about what ever. \n\n\nI think I remember him once being featured on this American life\u2026 it was a episode about a dude in his car who wnYed to quit his job or something. \n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?  \n\nThnaks \n\n\nPS sorry sally",

There have been a few posts on here recommending best episodes - a couple i really liked were  \"Prison Bound\" - a young woman going to prison the next day, and \"Honor Among the Barbers of Kansas\" - young football coach / barber and his very funny/ thoughtful ruminations on life",

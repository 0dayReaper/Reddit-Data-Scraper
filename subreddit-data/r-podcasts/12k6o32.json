Shows that you have come across and didn\u2019t know you needed, gems that you never would have thought of yourself. A few that I\u2019ve found:\n\nLocations unknown- I know there are National park true crimes out there, but I haven\u2019t found too many awesome search and rescue stories the way these guys provide along with the great park info\n\nWe choose you - 4 guys pick the 6 member Pok\u00e9mon team of a celebrity, fictional character, etc. \n\nBreaking down collapse- a look at all of the possible ways that society could collapse and what we need to do as humans in order to prevent those events\n\nCriminality - reality tv true crime but more of the pettier crimes and not really murder, think Jen shah, sister wives legal issues, countess Luann and her Florida arrest, you get the vibe\n\nStory hole - deep dives into fictional characters, they just did a fantastic episode on Garfield, a must listen!\n\nWhat\u2019s a show that doesn\u2019t fit into just any one category that you have found?",

I have no idea who any of the guests are, and yet have loved every single episode because the premise is so fantastic.\n\n**Normal Gossip** \\- Host tells a guest third-hand gossip (anonymized) about random social or professional situations. You get the fun of hearing gossip without the guilt of spreading it yourself. Almost every story is gold.\n\n**Small Town Murder** \\- Think of it as a comedic geography podcast that happens to have true crime. They introduce the history, demographics, tourist attractions, house prices, etc of a small town to set the stage for a murder that happened there. Super well researched on both the small town and the murder investigation. Note: Regular eps are upwards of 3 hours long, but there are 1-hour \"express\" eps.\n\nETA: Thanks for Story Hole, OP! Just listened to the McDonaldland ep and *loved* it. Great recc.",

Also worth mentioning that it\u2019s not nearly as depressing as you\u2019d imagine. I actually felt that it gave me a deeper sense of appreciation for life.",

They not only cover the big releases, but smaller lgbtq themed movies and shows, interview creators and talent, etc. \n\n\u201cEvil Men\u201d - kind of in the vein of \u201cBehind the Bastards\u201d but it also includes fictional characters like Dr. doom and Gargamel.

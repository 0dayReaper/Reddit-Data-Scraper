So I am not evading taxes because even if I told the government about my work, I wouldn't have to give them any, it would just be a lot more paperwork for all of us without any gain so there is no point.

I listen to them when I work out, cook, do chores, and just about anything. \n\nOver the years though I have gotten a bit ruthless dropping and cutting podcast. I used to listen to lots of true crime podcast and still do but I\u2019ve cut pretty much all the ones that have a comedy element to it and focus on just ones that give the info without the fluff.\n\nIf you feel overwhelm don\u2019t be afraid to just drop a podcast. Not everyone can consume all media out there. You have to pick and choose what you like and what is worth your time. If I\u2019m listening to a podcast that has 30 minutes left and I haven\u2019t quite enjoyed the episode my thought is should I listen to the rest or can the next 30 minutes be spent on something better.",

Daily updates I try and actually listen to on a daily basis - If you miss out on something it's not the end of the world. This is a small category.\n2. Daily learning - a small piece of daily learning that I actively try NOT to miss. Smallest but highest resolve/guilt category\n3. Weekly cadence podcasts on different topics - This is the largest category, but I only listen to a podcast if it's actually interesting... Many podcasts aren't worth it just because they're \"in your feed\". For me these include Recode Decode, [Exponent.fm](https://Exponent.fm), The North Star, Lecture Breakers, Invest like the best etc...\n\nBecause a lot of the content isn't time sensitive, I usually catch up on things over the weekend or during breaks :-)",

Then I just binge a bunch in a row when I get the time. \n\nI used to clear out my podcast playlist and have nothing to listen to, so this is a better solution for me.

Like others have suggested, it might be time for a purge, but one thing that helped me some was just finding new opportunities to hear them in my daily routines. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym and while they are cheap, they are designed to stay on the ear and keep the cord out of the way, so I\u2019ll throw them on while cleaning, washing dishes, etc. and put on a podcast. Works better with shorter ones, obviously, but being willing to adapt to a different way of listening was useful for me.",

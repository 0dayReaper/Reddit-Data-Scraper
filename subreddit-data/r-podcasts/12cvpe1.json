Spotify, Amazon Music, Luminary and many more providers have been snatching up successful podcasts to build their own exclusive brands. I don't think listeners should buy into this model. I loved the Mr. Ballen podcast but haven't listened to a single episode since he went exclusive to Amazon music. Vote with your money/listenership. If they fail on these platforms, they'll go back to being free and publicly available. Look at The Last Podcast on the Left and their shitty move and quick move back from Spotify.",

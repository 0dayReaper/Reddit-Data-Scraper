    "postText": "Hello guys,\n\ni only listen to German podcasts, mainly gaming and true crime, but want to extend my scope and want to start listening to English stuff.What are \"THE\" english gaming podcasts that everybody listens who is intrigued in review stuff, making ofs and just interesting stuff. Maybe there is even a \"Lets play\"-podcast or format?In the podcast i hear mainly there is a lot going on, with many formats. (Auf ein Bier/Gamespodcast for the fellow Germans with tips)\n\nCan of course be a paid podcast.",

I stopped listening to VGA a while ago. I forget why - I know I stopped listening to 30-20-10 when Sarah left, as she brought a glue that I missed. But she was never on VGA. Maybe I'll try again, see why I quit. Honestly, if Antista is on it, that might be why. He's a pain in the ass sometimes.",

Frankly, I don't need to listen to Three Moves Ahead's 150th episode on Paradox games because I just don't really care, but I'll listen in if they talk about Wartales or Second Front. And I won't listen to every episode of The Besties because I'm not a Zelda fan and I know there's going to be a bunch of episodes about the new one.\n\nI suppose it's easier with Cane And Rinse because the episode is solely about that game, so I can pick and choose. A bit harder with the weekly episodes of The Besties because they tend to cover a few things; it's hard to just skip through the podcast because once they're talking about a game, the title isn't mentioned a whole lot so I need to figure out from context clues if they've moved on to something else or are still in it.",

They are witty and have good chemistry and I like listening to them even if I'm not interested in the game du jour they are covering.\n\nThat said, they're more of a game discussion cast than a review cast, if that makes sense. They don't worry too much about covering breaking game news or every significant release. Recently they ditched their plans to discuss Dead Island 2 in favor of a quirky indie game called Mr Sun's Hatbox when they realized how little they had to say about Dead Island. I for one appreciate that, I'd much rather listen to them passionately discussing something I've never heard about than them taking forty minutes to say that a generic zombie game is pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be. But if you listen expecting it to help you keep your finger on the pulse of gaming, I can see how that would be disappointing.\n\nJust to be clear, I love and highly recommend this podcast. It has a subreddit too, r/thebesties that is pretty good as well.",

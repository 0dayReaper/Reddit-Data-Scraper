    "postText": "I love science-y natural history nonfiction books that go into depth about a topic, and usually explored through some sort of scientific adventure.\n\nJust for reference (in the book world)\u2014 I just read Owls of the Eastern Ice, and currently reading Fens, Bogs, and Swamp. Read something else about insects and music. \n\nSo, I love stuff from Radiolab, Outside/In, etc but I\u2019m looking for series that aren\u2019t just one-off episodes, instead an entire season/ series dedicated to a topic. It could be investigate by nature, or not, doesn\u2019t matter. Just want an immersive full series in this genre. I prefer some good sound design and would like it to be sonically  interesting. I feel like this genre in audiobooks is so lackluster, and can be so much better with sound design that can really bring out these environmental elements.\n\nThanks y\u2019all!",

They are an unusual format in that hey aren't studio base rather they go into the field looking for a fern or fish and describe what they are finding and the habitats they are seeing.  So pretty unusual in that way.\n\nAlso, David Attenborough has his Life Stories series.  There are two seasons of it out there.  This is a more conventional studio based series with BBC quality sound.",

I\u2019m just getting a little worried about him. Do you think he\u2019s just gradually moving to a paid only platform or is his health getting worse?",

His podcast today said he\u2019s only putting 1 new episode out a week bc he has to concentrate on paying members. \u201cThe girlfriend\u201d has Covid &amp; he thinks he has it again. I used to love his podcast but now it\u2019s not even worth listening to the free show.",

There was more than a few shows were he sounded like he should\u2019ve been sleeping it off instead. Go read the reviews on apple,  they are hilarious &amp; right on.",

I used to love the show.  Now? Not so much.  The guy is always high.  He\u2019s angry.  Aggressive.  And now he\u2019s kicking people off the Patreon who question his COVID excuse.  It\u2019s clear the guy needs help.  His new thing of a washed up girlfriend is an enabler.   He needs to clean up and get back on track.  Like the other commenter said, read the ITunes reviews.  Spot on!",

            "comment": "The letter?\n\nThe father was infuriating to me throughout the whole podcast and if I can speculate, seemingly this whole ordeal. He has every right to refuse to talk about his son, however, as a semi famous person, he has to know it's going to come up in interviews. I do have sympathy for him in that regard though. As for the podcast...he would only talk about this situation on HIS terms, and was again extremely limited in what he would say, and it's like, guy, you agreed to be on a podcast, a podcast solely focused on your son and his crime. AGREED. Given that, yeah, you need to talk and answer questions. Nothing he said on the podcast made me very sympathetic to him or the family which is...not great. \n\nAs for the letter...WOW. I stopped the podcast and played it for my partner because I was so damn gobsmacked by the sheer audacity of his words. NO APOLOGY?? To say he forgave THEM?? I think a good 50% of the Kane family's anger stemmed from that letter, and what they extrapolated out from that letter; the feelings of the Wideman family in general about the murder. That they were equal victims and so on. I can say without a doubt had my son been murdered and in my deepest grief I received a letter from the perpetrator's father that read the way John's letter did, I would make it my mission to fuck over that family for the rest of my days. It was THAT misguided, uncaring and narcissistic to me. \n\nAll that being said about the letter, I do understand the insanity of grief. How it blinds you and infuriates you and confuses things, and John was certainly experiencing deep grief at the prospect of losing his son to life in prison, or even by the death penalty. So, I'm willing to allow that he wrote that letter in a haze of grief, regrets it, and would choose much different words if he could do it all over again with a clear head. But then again....he writes for a living!! How could you be so obtuse??! \n\nThe flip side of the grief is the Kane family. I felt like the podcast portrayed them in a negative light, yes. Several times I thought, enough!! Just quit harping on it and let Jacob get out- he's served his time!! The podcast made it pretty clear that's what they thought they should do. But again, idk, all facts considered, I don't blame the Kane's for wanting him in prison forever. Often I hear on true crime podcasts that the victim's family has forgiven the perpetrator and that always seems unfathomable to me. As someone who has lost someone i love far too soon, I don't think I would have it in me to forgive and essentially forget a person if they stole the life of my loved one for no reason. Because that's what passively letting Jacob get out of prison is doing: forgetting. Forgetting and letting go of the fact that he murdered your son. Couldn't be me. However, none of that changes the fact that what the board of corrections did is fucked up.",

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever felt more compelled to actually spend the time to comment on Reddit. \n\nThe actions and behavior of the victim\u2019s parents from what has been presented so far is obscene. The handful of audio clips I have heard so far of them at the parole hearings is just as bad as the crime itself. The biggest difference is Jake was only 16 when he committed his crime.",

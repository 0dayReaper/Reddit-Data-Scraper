I use it for podcasts like Magnus Archives that have lots of episodes I want to listen to chronologically without having to scroll down to the bottom of the episode list each time I\u2019m ready for the next show.",

The biggest thing I learned that you lose by listening there? Show notes. If you format show notes, add hyperlinks, chapters, artwork and names for each chapter? Spotify basically deletes it all, and forces the show notes into one blob of a paragraph. Instead of neatly separated, hyperlinked notes. It's a small thing but if I say \"links are in the show notes\" you go look and just see \"here's the video\" but no link. I look like a fool when really it's Spotify that's messed it all up",

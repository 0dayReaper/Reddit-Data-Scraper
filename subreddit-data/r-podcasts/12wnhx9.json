Can you recommend any museums that I would appreciate and enjoy after listening to this podcast? I\u2019m currently on episode 75, just after the Norman invasion in 1066. TIA!",

Normally I\u2019d never batt an eye over a news article like this, but now I\u2019m so keen to know more. To think I started this \u201cboring \u201c podcast in the hopes it would help my insomnia.",

I had written you a comment recommending the museum, as it has the history of London going way back, with things like fossils from a woolly mammoth [https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/discover/beasts-ancient-london](https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/discover/beasts-ancient-london) \n\nI thought I'd just double check their website before I replied, and found out it's been closed since December.\n\nThey have a site in Docklands which is much smaller and only has exhibits for more recent history, but I hear it is very well done (I haven't been to that one).\n\nThere are several very good museums in London though. The Natural History museum is fantastic, so is the Science Museum, both are free but not exactly what you're looking for. \n\nYou could try asking over on the r/London sub.",

I also love the Clink Prison Museum on Bankside, it's small and unflashy but gives you a very evocative glimpse into some of the grimmer aspects of life in London past.",

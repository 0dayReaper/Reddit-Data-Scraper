Definitely does a lot of dispelling or confirmation of various medical myths or folk cures, history, and such. \n\nAlso, like someone already mentioned, Stuff You Should Know is great for useful history and information. Not necessarily always highly actionable information, but definitely informative to real world events.\n\nHuberman Lab is also pretty interesting. Professor of neurobiology doing a podcast about how to optimize brain chemistry from various angles. Sorta a self-improvement podcast, but from the basis of proven science. Mostly stuff like how to optimize work/rest cycles, nutrition, stress management, sleep, that sort of thing. I haven't listened to a ton of it, but the episodes I have were quite informative and useful",

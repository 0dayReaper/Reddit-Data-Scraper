    "postText": "I've been hearing some BBC podcasts on true crime that are relatively short and voiced by Jamie Bartlett: *The Crypto Queen* and *Believe in Magic*. I like that they don't have episodes that last forever, so I'm look for an American true crime podcast like that with a narrator with a soothing voice.",

Naked Emperor is the shortest I think. Opportunist is also a pretty short format pod and she has a great voice. \n\nI hope you\u2019ll still check these out though. Talk to Me is really long, almost more like an audio book but it\u2019s so good.",

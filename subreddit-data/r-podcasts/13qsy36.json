A bit rambly and variable quality topics, but their other shows are the best:\n\nWag the Doug! Ontario politics\n\nCommons certain seasons are incredible. I loved Corruption, Crude, and Dynasties, Pandemic and Mining! Its not current news necessarily, but usually relevant to ongoing legal/political issues and gives a lot of deeper understanding.\n\nThunder Bay. Again, not news, but it should be. Wish they had got funding to do Niagara Falls.",

    "postText": "Hi! I recently found this newer podcast on Instagram- it\u2019s called Smut Up and Listen. Looks like they are pretty new so I wanted to shout them out! It\u2019s three girls and one of them doesn\u2019t read smut (dirty romance) and the other two do. They dive into the books and get the \u201csmut virgins\u201d reaction, it\u2019s honestly very funny! I was able to find them on Spotify! :)",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am looking to cut down on my internet usage but there is always this fear of being left out of the loop and not being able to discuss current events with people in person. Do you guys know any good podcasts that cover hot topics weekly. I think if I were to listen to a 3-4 hour podcast per week that could cover a little bit of everything, I could still stay up to date.\n\nI already have 1 podcast in mind that sorta does this but looking to see if there are other options. I don't mean just a news podcast, but something that also goes into things like big mma fights coming up, hot topics on the internet, bit of gaming/tech talk, bit of politics. Just something that covers a wide range.\n\nThanks",

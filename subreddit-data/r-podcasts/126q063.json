    "postText": "I listened to an audio drama podcast about a year or so ago. My Spotify history doesn\u2019t go back far enough to find it. \nI *thought* it was by QCode but I can\u2019t find it. \n\nThe plot was that a woman representing the USA was in space, on a space station where a virus had broken out and killed everyone else in the space station. \n\n*possible spoilers below for anyone who hasn\u2019t finished the show*\n\nDuring the podcast, the woman talks to the ai/ship voice. She keeps telling the ship that she has to find \u201cwhat\u2019s broken\u201d in the ship\u2019s code. The woman had a dog on earth, whose name I believe was Red. She keeps hallucinating the dog. At some point she discovers other people while out on an exploration on a nearby planet (mars maybe?) and those people end up putting the woman on trial for crimes they believe she committed. \n\nIt was fairly short, only one season. \n\nI cannot for the life of me remember the name of it, and Google is not bringing up the right answers. \n\nAny leads?",

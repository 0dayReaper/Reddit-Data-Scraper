    "postText": "I don't normally listen to comedy podcasts, but when I followed a suggestion on this thread to listen to Valley Heat I was hooked. Are there any other podcasts similar to this one? I know this is a specific kind of podcast, so I don't even really know what I mean by \"similar to Valley Heat\". I guess I'm looking for the same type of humor.\n\nThanks!",

Its not just a comedy podcast with amazing characters, it's a Jan Robinson podcast...\n\nNightdrive has similar-ish style of absurdist humour, weird characters\n\nBeef and Dairy Network is good, also surreal, but perhaps getting further away from defined narrative story",

I think is a small operation, surprising given quality of acting, music, songs etc.  He is riding very slim in terms of profile!",

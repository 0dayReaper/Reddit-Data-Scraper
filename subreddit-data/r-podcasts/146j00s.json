    "postText": "Is there any podcasts out there about fictional characters? Like what makes a certain character special and how the way theyre written in the story. Something that leans more towards an opinionated or personal approach and not something that just sounds like a teacher explaining why a character is a good character. I like to hear ppls personal opinions and why a character is relatable or at least personal to them regardless of their role in the story.",

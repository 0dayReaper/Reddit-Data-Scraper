For me it helps to clarify the position of Rowling as well as understand the nature of the conflicting interests of these two groups of people. Also, it's good to see an attempt in rational discussion on this hard and controversial topic.",

I think both have moral and intellectual integrity and I was impressed by their clear-headedness in what can be a murky topic. Also particularly impressed by Noah, the trans boy interviewed in the final (or penultimate? can\u2019t remember) episode. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and on the fence about listening, I recommend that you do. It\u2019s not polemical but rather sensitive and thoughtful and well-reasoned. Listen and *then* evaluate - don\u2019t write it off based on what you think it might say.",

            "comment": "In terms of \"consensus,\" I would say it depends on who you ask. I found that part of the LGBTQ+ community (which in general seems to be imploding in on itself these days) found it to be too apologetic towards J. K. Rowling, solidifying her martyrdom rather than criticizing her to all hell. As a trans-man myself, with (hopefully) adequately developed critical thinking skills, I think it was a fascinating listen. Not in a \"Know Thy Enemy\" way, but rather, in a 'I am sincerely curious to hear her out and have been for a while' way. I really enjoyed the way the podcast does not address Rowling's beliefs in a vacuum. It actually touches upon major historical (and personal) events, alongside the cultural changes that they inspired in order to create a more cohesive, full, and dare I say objective understanding of how we got to where we are today. I think that at its heart, and this is a question I dabble with myself every day, it deals with the issue of what happens when the pendulum swings so far that it does a full 180, and seemingly progressive ideals end up being just as exclusionary and silencing as those that they allegedly fight against? It is a difficult question to answer, but it is, however, an important one to ask nonetheless.",

It\u2019s becoming clear to me that Rowling is operating from a place of fear and it\u2019s understandably clouding her vision in some parts. Whereas the outpouring negative response from insults to sexual threats is only fuelling the fire. She should start having a lot of calm conversations with trans people and researchers who have enormous amount of patience and are willing to explain things calmly and rationally. Which I can believe is very hard with this particular topic.",

I\u2019m still balancing the whole issue in my mind, but after reading about the 1k page novel by jkr whose serial killer villain is a cross dressing man who stalks and kills women in bathrooms, it\u2019s safe to say that if these infringements exist jkr is not the person to bring them up. Mind you the podcast is an arm of a body aimed at free speech absoluteness, and that being able tweet whatever you want is the right they care most about.

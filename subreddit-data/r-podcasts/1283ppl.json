If you're into horror, you most likely have heard this podcast before, but in case you haven't: It's a bunch of separate stories in one ep usually ranging from one hour to an hour and thirty minutes. Or sometimes an episode can be one big tale.\n\nThe Wrong Station. Kinda like The No Sleep Podcast, but the eps are usually thirty minutes and contain one story.\n\nKnifepoint horror. Really enjoy this one.\n\n\nRadio Rental: Accounts are told by the person who experienced them. Super high quality.\n\nHigh Strange: Made by the same team that made Radio Rental, however this focuses on UFOs. Really new, so there is currently only two eps. The account told in the first two episodes are very captivating. \n\n\nImpact Winter: Vampires + meteorite = Impact Winter. 10/10 ddrama.\n\n\n Tumanbay: Medieval drama.\n\n\nDarkest Night: Highly recommend listening with headphones or earbuds.\n\nHave yet to listen to the podcast fully, but had got to listen to the trailer, and seems super interesting: Station 151.",

It's only released its first season so far but WOW it really pulled out of the gates. \n \nThe Program audioseries is an anthology that's kind of like a slightly less creepy version of Black Mirror. It think it's out of Canada.  \n \nWolf 356. You just have to check out Wolf 356. I'm actually pretty surprised no one else has recommended it, it's one of the all-time favorites of r/audiodrama",

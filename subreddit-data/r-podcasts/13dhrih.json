The issue is more nuanced than you think. Some children do need intervention when they are still minors or they are at very real risk. Just because we all go through a phase where we rebel against societal norms including gender norms it feels to us that all trans people will just grow out of gender dysmorphia. But that\u2019s not what their experience is like. I understand and maybe even support the requirement of having strict and robust guidelines for situations where medical intervention for minors can be used but they already do exist. Again, episode 6 of witch trials - hear Noah speak with an open mind and then come back to this question.",

Full disclosure: I listened to a dozen or so episodes because I\u2019m interested in bullying and cancellation and the aftermath of those incidents - I don\u2019t ever want to be part of a mob that just dogpiles on people. But when it comes to trans issues, I am on the side that believes people when they express their identities. \n\nI found BARpod to be very difficult to understand, it\u2019s absolutely brimming with sarcasm and inside jokes. I felt like I was coming in on the middle of a conversation that had been going for a very long time, and half the time, I couldn\u2019t understand what they were referring to.",

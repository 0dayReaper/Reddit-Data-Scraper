How Susie dealt with anxiety last year after XYZ, or how Bobby lost weight when he tried eating blueberries for a whole month. I discover podcasts and when I look up who runs it they are \u201cinternet celebrities\u201d. Are there any good podcasts that are actually run by experts in their field?",

It ends up going into MUCH more than just country music, as you may think of it. It will go into the history of some immigrant groups in America, the history of the technology of the music industry, the history of the business of the music industry, laws about censorship or sexism or racism. Addiction issues, interpersonal issues, the off-the-books history behind some of the rock groups and albums from the 60s you probably know well. Some of them even end up being closer to 'true crime' genre episodes.",

Episodes include both narrative episodes and interviews with experts in specific topics such as region/era specific archeologists, DNA experts, linguists and the like. I recently finished up the season on prehistory. It is long and feels like I took a university course on the wide ranging subject from a really skilled lecturer and teacher. But without the homework.  10/10. The host's initial success was with a podcast called the fall of Rome. It is well reviewed and I plan on diving in as soon as I am caught up on the current Iron Age season of Tides Of History. Edit: I majored in History so have a pretty strong frame of reference and this feels legit and transparent as far as methods and missing knowledge",

Contrary to the title, stories about darknet markets and those involved are just a tiny portion of the subject matter (although coincidentally one of the most recent episodes as of writing is a really good one about that called \u201cSam the Vendor\u201d, so go listen to that one right now).  The author has guests from literally all corners/bowels of the infosec/cybersecurity realms, and even some who are just bystanders/victims with a fascinating angle of a story to tell.  Not only are they just plain great stories, but you\u2019re  likely to actually learn something practical and useful about how to keep yourself safe/secure in the online world today, presented in a way that literally anyone can consume it and apply it.",

They do an entertaining job of presenting an alternate viewpoint of different events/ideas, but it's really not intended to be balanced or very well considered. Anytime you know a fair bit about a topic, you'll recognize that they make about as many leaps and generalizations as they complain about, but from a different point of view.",

I couldn't make it through the first episode, tried another episode from the middle of the series and it was just as annoying. It was a massive disappointment because I'm super into the science of nutrition, but this podcast comes across as two friends talking about why it's okay to be fat* \n\n*which it totally is, but nutrition is so much more than just body weight!!!",

He's coming at it from an angle that makes some of the subjects accessible and relevant and actually interesting, whereas other podcasts are as dry as sandpaper. Also, nothing wrong with being a contrarian - more interesting to have a range of views, regardless of whether you agree or not.",

Rogan's shows may be interesting but because of his style he does not do a tonne of research or call people out on their bullshit. \n\nPersonally I'm not a huge fan because of the other issues I mentioned and the whole having Alex Jones on a bunch of times.  \n\nI get what you mean when you say nothing wrong with being a contrarian but Joe Rogan has a bigger reach that some news websites and when he has a person on he is exposing millions of people to that person. \n\nAlex Jones just asking question meant crazy people harassed the parents of the kids who died in sandy hook, and because Rogan had Alex on his show Alex would have gotten new listeners and thus more power to do shit like that.\n\nOr Joe interviewing Vaccine sceptics which meant millions of people got exposed to bad science takes on vaccines, And since Joe is not an expert he can't call them on it, its likely a lot of people did not take the covid vaccine because of those interviews which meant more people got infected. \n\nInterviewing contrarians is fine for most things but if you are exposing people to obscure views on medicine or conspiracy theories you need to have someone who does a lot of research, which Joe simply does not do.",

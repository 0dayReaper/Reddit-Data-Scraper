    "postText": "Trying out a new podcast, just to listen for 5 minutes about new updates to the merch/website/social media before the topic of the episode even gets *mentioned* is something that stops me from giving it a proper chance.\n\nI can understand friendly banter between co-hosts (as long as it isn't too long), it at least shows you the general chemistry so you know what to expect moving forward. But then there's the \"Hey guys, so we've got a new ...\" type of message, which to a new listener is nothing but a filler. If you've got a fanbase already and you want them to learn about something new and exciting, just tease it shortly and *explain at the end of the episode*. **If they are fans, they will listen until the end anyway.**\n\nNot to mention that some podcasts like to *additionaly* slap an ad at the beginning together with a musical intro, resulting in the actual content starting in 5+ minutes. As a person who listens to podcasts mostly while biking, constantly skipping can be really frustrating.",

I was very disappointed about LPOTL moving to spotify but when the Ringer also had spotify exclusive content (Bill Simmons sports network) I decided to go for it, since I had two shows to go out of my way for.\n\nThe spotify interface is such trash. All I want to do is make a playlist, and it never really worked out for me. I spent at least 5 minutes at least a few times trying to figure it out and couldn't. I even looked up a youtube video explaining how to do what I thought I wanted to do (it wasn't) - I made a substantial effort and failed.\n\nHonestly, just make it easy to make a playlist where I can see what is going to come next and in what order. That functionality is so integral to podcast listening it's mind blowing to me how poorly spotify handles it. \n\nWhat I do is I load up the spotify app (which by the way somehow needs to update every single time I have ever used it - not important just annoying) once a week and listen to spotify exclusive shows then I run the other way from that horrifying interface for the rest of the week. \n\nI have no issue using spotify to make music playlists, and it's a decent music service. It is trash for podcasts.",

In a few years, I have to download 5 different apps because 7 of the 24 podcasts I listen to are exclusives to one of 4 different platforms, plus my regular podcast feed reader.

They started revisiting old topics, re-uploading old episodes, trying to fill out a 30 minute episode with a topic that could be thoroughly explored in 5 minutes, etc.\n\nThere are several ways you can handle running out of things to talk about.\n\n1. Publish less often.\n\n1. Post one last episode where you explain that you are running thin on things to talk about so you are quitting while you are ahead so you will be ending this show and starting a new one, and explain how to find it.\n\n1. Rebrand the show.  This is best for if you are just doing a pivot or expanding the area of discussion (eg, going from talking about the history of the Republican party to talking about the history of American political parties as a whole.)\n\nIf you need help with recording, editing, publishing, etc. hit me up!

For the most part, studies seem to pretty consistently say that people are too... uninformed to make the distinction between things they don't like, and things they don't respond to. If ads didn't work, then why do they still exist? Ads obviously work, and people buy more of a given brand because they rely on heuristics to make decisions unless they go through an extensive shopping period, and even then they often still make suboptimal decisions (like buying name brand OTC meds). People literally don't understand how ads effect them. Bagging on their podcast numbers doesn't change that.",

It's very jarring to go from, \"Here's my tense, traumatic story about almost getting kidnapped in a supermarket,\" to, \"Here's Rainn Wilson making funnies.\"\n\nI think Rainn is hilarious. He has a fantastic voice, and he's a phenomenal voice actor, but the tone is a little too incongruous for me. His character is more suited for a \"Tales From the Crypt\" style fiction anthology - something that's a little more campy. \n\nWhen you're telling true stories about serious subject matter (like terrorism, murder, sexual assault, and home invasion), having a comedic, Cryptkeeper-style framing device is inappropriate at best and offensive at worst. \n\n\"Nyah-ha-ha! What a ghoulish delight that tale was! That real camp counselor - an actual person with thoughts and feelings - barely escaped being sexually assaulted and murdered! I sure hope she asked for *hazard pay!* Nyah-ha-ha-ha!\" \n\nIt's really fucked up, now that I think about it. It's treating people's real experiences and trauma like corny made-for-TV vignettes. Wow, I started this comment being somewhat into Radio Rental, and now I think that podcast can go fuck itself.",

By choosing a later episode you can see what it's going to be like eventually, and how much of  \"banterists\" the hosts are. \n\nOf course this is assuming episodes don't relate to each other :)",

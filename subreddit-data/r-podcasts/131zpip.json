Having said that, the last few episodes have left a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like her bragging/self aggrandizement is getting out of control. Has anyone else noticed this, too? Like, on her David Arquette episode, the guy could barely get a word in before she\u2019d start talking about herself, her charity work, etc. It was kinda gross.",

    "postText": "I want to financially support several of my favorite podcasts. However, I do not like the monthly payment plan that seems to be the only option on Patreon, and I'm not interested in the various perks that Patreon supporters receive. I would rather contribute one time per year, and I want to do this all in one payment rather than going to each podcast's website and contributing that way. I am thinking of something along the lines of Charity Navigator where each year I have a basket of charities and designate how much I want to contribute. Does something like this exist for podcasts?",

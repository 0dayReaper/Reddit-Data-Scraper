He kept talking about the pandemic and how dumb some of the measures were, and then talk over Gupta at times when he\u2019d try to explain something. He used to never press on guests like that. It used to be a calm, educational discussion with some jokes thrown in but he\u2019s definitely been pushing his own shit on people for the past year or two",

He's sort of flown off the handle to become a very vocal antivaxxer and spouts weird covid conspiracy stuff. That was also around when he got his $100 million spotify deal which seemed to go straight to his head. The thing that made the podcast good before was the curiosity but now it's like he thinks of himself as some sort of serious renegade journalist. \n\nI saw a clip the other day where he had that Jocko guy on after he had had some medical expert. Obviously they had disagreed about vaccines, but he was telling Jocko how the Dr. wasn't prepared to deal with all of Joe's facts and references a file on his phone of all his \"sources\". Granted i didn't have full context, but it seemed like he legitimately thinks he knows more about medicine than doctors.",

            "comment": "A writer for Media Matters listened to 350 hours of the program in the past year before coming out last week with [Joe Rogan Wrapped: A year of COVID-19 misinformation, right-wing myths, and anti-trans rhetoric](https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/joe-rogan-wrapped-year-covid-19-misinformation-right-wing-myths-and-anti-trans).  The piece highlights 28 specific instances of that rhetoric.  An interview with the author is the focus of this week's [Hot Pod Newsletter](https://hotpodnews.com/).  The author asserts that Rogan is increasingly pushing major right-wing theories.\n\n&gt;I believe he's become more emboldened to push baseless conspiracy theories and right-wing lies over the past year. Since I started reporting on Rogan's podcast, he's broken into mainstream coverage fairly often: first, with his lie about left-wing people starting wildfires in Oregon, and then again really prominently, [saying] he would encourage healthy, young people not to get vaccinated. And throughout all of that reporting, at least from my view, he hasn't faced any real punishment from Spotify. And I think that's emboldened him to continue pushing hate and lies on his podcast. Just from listening to him every day, he's by no means remitting conspiracy theories and false rhetoric on his show. If anything, he's leaning into it more. He's celebrated in conservative spaces for it. He\u2019s a darling of the conservative right in the United States.",

He has guests in all these areas.",

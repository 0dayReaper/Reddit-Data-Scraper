He put a lot of strong research into it, however he was still finding his footing in the podcast world so he's a little awkward in it. The one on Magellan is actually just a wild ride because there was so much history I wasn't even aware of. The Renaissance one is good too!\n\nA really wild and wack episode is the one about the Magician of the Gods.\n\nThose are my picks, they're all solid.",

I\u2019m starting to wonder if I imagined the entire thing. So I thought I would ask Reddit! Does the following story ring a bell to anyone? \n\n~ A large conference with many people attending to learn about self-growth and enhance their mindset\n\n~ A break in the day where attendees were encouraged to walk around the city  and ponder their lives\n\n~ All of a sudden, one of them commits suicide by jumping off a building\n\nThanks in advance if anyone can help! Starting to think I\u2019m crazy!",

But friends and family members of his followers questioned his unorthodox methods, and tried to stop him.",

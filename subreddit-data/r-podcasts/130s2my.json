    "postText": "As the title suggests I'm looking for some comedy podcasts. I'm from the UK so I would probably vibe more with UK humour but I'm of course open to all suggestions. The only two podcasts I've really gotten into are Athletico Mince and Off Menu (mainly just the episodes with comedians) which I absolutely love, I'm also a big fan of the old Ricky Gervais XFM radio series. Let me know what you think I might enjoy!",

After Trump won I dove into the conservative and online extreme mediasphere because I didn't understand why so many people voted for him. I had to know what I was up against as I moved further left at that time and away from the center.\n\nthese people all complain endlessly about the same topics. When I did it in 2016/2017 it was all college liberals. I assume it's all trans people now and I assume it was all BLM back in 2020. Usually, someone with close to 0 actual political power of consequence, but a lot of cultural power of the moment they want to rail on. They often have a pretty bleak and despondent view of current culture.\n\nMost of them invite \"intellectual\" guests on, some who sound qualified and acceptable if you aren't paying close attention, but a lot are actually quite bigoted, greatly exaggerated their credentials, or have a secret agenda. I would say 25% of their guests had something interesting to say that made learn more about the anti-left or conservative movement, the other 75% I got fed things I had to later disprove or found out were totally untrue. Dave Rubin was where this got so obvious it became a bit hilarious.\n\nThe algos start throwing more and more shit that is masked pretty well. I stumbled on Gavin Mcinnes who seemed kinda funny, doing a little online show in a suit, but on a bit closer investigation, the dude was basically a NAZI and was currently working on how to stoke up Charlottesville and the Proud Boys. I also stumbled upon Candance Owens well before she got famous and it was one of those moments the convinced me to stop the exercise because she was so disgusting and I started realizing how horrible she was. If she was let on a bunch of shows, how wrong were the other guests? How much had I listened to that was basically false? Turns out it was a lot.\n\nYour algorithms start shifting HARD right all across everything. Facebook, Youtube, social media. I was getting trump campaign and shitty MAGA merch advertisements for years after. Youtube is basically ruined after just a tiny bit of right-wing video watching that I turned off watch history.\n\nA lot of these people have gotten even more extreme since I did this exercise and even harder to listen to. I would say Ben Shapiro is by far the most normal and enjoyable out of those above, but I have not listened to him in 5+ years. At least he's funny a little bit of the time even if he's an annoying punk I disagree with 97% of the time.",

By that same token are Russell Brand and Joe Rogan nowadays usually portrayed as right wing, simply because they also have conservative views. Which is absurd, given that the three of them (Peterson, Rogan &amp; Brand) have many liberal views as well (if not equal). I get your point, wanting to find out for yourself. However I think it unwise to disregard people\u2019s own claims (unless one suspects everyone to be a liar). When you listen to these people for long enough, oftentimes you\u2019ll hear them tell their views in their own words, which is that they find themselves somewhere in the middle. They don\u2019t exactly keep it a secret, since often enough they discuss the claims being made about them in articles and media or other podcasts. I am European too, and I like to inquire stuff for myself as well. Still, I\u2019d recommend listening to Jordan Peterson\u2019s first podcasts which are essentially the lectures he gave to his students in 2016/2017. Something like that.",

Many people who love the environment don\u2019t agree with environmentalist agendas, because the science is by and large still undecided. Good source on that topic would be Steve Koonin, who also has an appearance on the JRE. \n\nFunnily enough, my onion on Tucker Carlson has completely changed since I saw his interview with Russell Brand from a couple of weeks ago. I used to think Carlson was a stubborn conservative, turns out he is way more open-minded and reasonable than I initially thought. People are always better themselves at explaining their stances and opinions than media outlets and podcasters.\n\nAt least you formed an opinion based on your own observations from someone\u2019s own words, that is a thousand times better than looking for podcasts and articles as to adopt someone else\u2019s opinion who\u2019s criticizing or demonizing others.",

    "postText": "My apologies if this is somewhat vague but I'm looking for podcast episodes about living in a big city and dealing with struggle, failure, aimlessness, the search for purpose, or just generally a memoir-style recounting of stories with those themes. Some things I've enjoyed in the past are:\n\nLong Nights Short Mornings (2016, movie, NYC)\nTake this Waltz (2011, movie, Toronto)\nReply All episode 36: Today's the Day (2015, NYC)\nLost in Translation (2003, movie, Tokyo)\nPJ Harvey: Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000, album, NYC)\nThe Bowery Boys (NYC)\nI Hope they Serve Beer in Hell (2006, book, NYC - I know Tucker Max is a scumbag and a liar but I like the vignette style, not the content)\n\nPerhaps this topic doesn't translate well to audio, but I'm hopeful there is some content out there. Thanks!!!",

There's an [episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple) which is basically 24 hours at a 24h diner in NYC, talking to everyone who stays for a bit. Great big-city-small-stories vibes",

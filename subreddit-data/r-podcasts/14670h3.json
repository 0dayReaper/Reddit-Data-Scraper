Hosts are funny, content is relevant, and it is produced by NYT so the production value is top notch too.\n\nFor non-current events, darknet diaries is great. He actually doesn't focus on the darnet that much, it's a lot of extremely riveting technology stories, often with interviews from the folks who are involved.",

It's really fascinating to hear the processes of the musicians in their own words.\n\nAnother one which gets rec'd a lot on this sub is the History of Music in 500 songs. I've only just begun it myself, but I bring it up because it feels a little crunchy in the way OP wants -- the guy talks a lot about the drum signatures and etc. It's not SUPER technical, but it's more technical than most music pods I've listened to.",

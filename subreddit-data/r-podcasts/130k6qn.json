I believe they've gone premium in recent years, but a lot of their older episodes are still available for free. As you'd guess from the title, it's a lot of people discussing traumas/death/life-altering experiences they've survived, and it runs the gamut.\n\nI like Nora McInerny as a podcast host. I don't think she does a ton of needless interjection and commentary the way a lot of hosts do. It's also really well-edited. Like, you're not listening to two people just gabbing for 45 minutes. And there's no effort to put a cheerful spin on anyone's experiences or find the silver lining. Sometimes guests will talk about the meaning they've made from their experiences, but it's not about overcoming adversity in a \"toxic positivity\" sort of way.\n\nETA: An episode I'd recommend both for how affected I was by and and for how purely batshit the story was is \"The Broken Places.\" The guests are three siblings whose dad was murdered by a hitman and whose mom later drove her car off a cliff, and what the aftermath was like for their family.",

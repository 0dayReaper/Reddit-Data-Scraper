    "postText": "I found this really cool audio drama podcast called Hannahpocalypse that I think anyone who likes apocalyptic stories will love. Here's the description- \"Hannahpocalypse is a forth wall breaking serial comedy/horror audio drama that follows the last zombie, Hannah; who\u2019s \u2018living\u2019 her best life over 150 years after the zombie apocalypse has come and gone. All the while Cali, a scout for a thriving settlement, looks to make a mark on the world but is coming up bust. Destined to collide, zombie and human will be forced into an unlikely friendship amid a wasteland full of raiders and unfriendly robots left over from the \u2018bad old days\u2019. It\u2019s a story of love, robots and a girl who eats people.\" It has a really interesting take on the apocalypse and in my opinion it's a hidden gem that I think people will love.",

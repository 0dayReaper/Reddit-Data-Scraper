And I feel that way because some podcast listeners are hardcore audiophiles. If they listen to your ONE episode that has choppy sound quality and then decide they don't like your show because of it, then you've just lost a potential subscriber.

Don't get me wrong, I think professional music audio engineers should ABSOLUTELY record and edit with monitors. Podcasters? Nope.\n\nRecord and edit your audio in an auditory environment similar to how your target audience is going to consume it. Are they going to listen to it in the car? Then use your laptop speakers. Are they going to listen to it on a smart speaker? Then use your laptop speakers. Are they going to listen to it with earbuds or headphones that aren't MONITORS? Then use earbuds or headphones that aren't monitors.\n\nAll monitors do is eliminate environmental sound and feed you only your mic sound on all of its frequencies. Which is great if you are going for super audiophile level of technical perfection. But it also gives you a totally unrealistic picture of what your audience is hearing.\n\nAfter setting my gain levels, I don't record with earphones/headphones/earbuds at all. I'm capable of keeping my face a standard distance from the mic. There is nothing else I would have needed headphones for.\n\nNow obviously, this advice doesn't work if you produce The Audiophile Weekly or any other audiophile-specific podcast where your target audience is audiophiles. But if you do, you aren't apologizing for background noise. You are straight up eliminating it.",

I\u2019ve had to skip multiple episodes. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve corrected the issue yet, I\u2019m still catching up on their back catalogue, but I know it still exists through the first 20 episodes and I could\u2019ve finish Mormonism Part 1 because it was so bad. = \\",

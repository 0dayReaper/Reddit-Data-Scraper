    "postText": "I can't be the only one who likes the studio version of podcasts better than the live audience version. There's a podcast that I listen to called \"How I Built This\" and the host really acts like its so great to have a live show with an audience but honestly they just aren't that great. There's people laughing at the jokes and it just takes me away from what's being discussed. Also the sound isn't as crisp as it would otherwise be in a controlled studio setting. \n\n---\n\nFor those wondering, I'm referring to the podcast downloading audience not the actual live audience at the event. I'm sure going to the live show is more engaging but if you are just downloading, I feel like the experience is worse for live shows than pre-recorded ",

I'm sure being present for a live show is as fun as attending an improv show or visiting a comedy club and well worth the ticket. But I hate listening to them, because the audience just makes me think of canned laughter and the hosts usually go a bit over the top. I prefer the more intimate feel I get from listening to a normal ep. I will say though that in the past year or so, Gareth and Dave have lost some of their fire and it comes out best in the live eps.",

With live shows, they get paid better, they may enjoy the experience and direct feedback, among other pros.  There are the cons of decreased sound quality, and the dynamic of a live show is certainly different than just alone in the studio.\n\nBut considering the culture of podcast listeners and how free they are with their unasked for criticisms, I think some producers find the con of \"a listener might complain about this\" a low priority.  From looking through the posts here, and hearing stories from podcasters, it seems like no matter what you do, someone will find something to complain about.  I do not blame podcasters who have a strong \"this is how we make our show, take it or leave it\" approach.  Sure, they may see decreased download numbers for live shows, but if they are making 200% the revenue by doing live shows, a 10 - 20% decrease of downloads for those shows probably seems like a good trade off.  \n\nThey may sound excited about live shows because they enjoy them more.

            "comment": "I think a good way to think about it is this. Say you do a podcast for 3 years every week. In those 3 years you are stuck in a dense ass sound recording studio recording. Then you get to sit in front of a computer editing the show, tweaking audio levels, cutting things out that the guest didn't want, editing out all the coughs, dead silences, and background noise etc. Next up is writing out descriptions, coming up with outlines for the next show, writing sketches, interview questions, and researching topics. After that you get in front of a computer or on the phone and start setting up guests, contacting agents going over scheduling, talking to producers, clearing music usage etc. Add on top of all that checking social media, responding to tweets. checking stats and listener ship numbers, and I am sure a million other things I haven't even considered.   \nYou know there is an audience out there listening, but to you they are only numbers and comments, and probably quite a bit of negative comments at that (can't imagine how that would feel after putting in all that time and effort). Your audience is really a ghost to you. That is until you do a live show and they become real, in the flesh, people who have actual reactions to the jokes you are telling, and the stories you are sharing. I am sure a live audience for most podcasters is an insanely fantastic, and probably, nerve wracking time. I am sure that a lot gets lost in the setup. You really don't know how everything is going to sound as each place is different sound wise. You have no idea how people are going to react to jokes or stories and I am sure all that leads to a great amount of tension, stress, excitement and forgetfulness. In a studio you know what to expect, you know how the sound carries, you sort of are comfortable in your bubble.  \nI think a lot of us consumers forget a lot of these factors when we complain about too many ads, using a paywall, a missed week here and there, or a not so great live show. I'm not dogging you for your opinion, but I really hop you take a second to consider all those factors. If you don't like it you can just skip those and go for the in studio stuff. I personally like the live shows. sure it's annoying where there are sight gags, or the audio isn't great, but shit happens. If you are a big podcast you can easily scrap the episode and move on no issue for the most part, however it's not that easy for a smaller podcast with a handful of people to just scrap an episode and hope to hold on to their listeners.

I went to one of Welcome To Night Vale's first live shows, and they did a great creepy bit about something being loose in a theater that absolutely was better if you were in the theater. I went to a later live show and it was frustrating because the fans were literally squealing over the mere mention of Carlos, although to be fair Cecil Baldwin was partly encouraging it with pauses and winks at the audience. I went to a Lore l live show and it was... OK, it was pretty much exactly the same as the podcast, if I closed my eyes I really wouldn't have noticed a difference aside from the better sound of the piano music. If anything, it felt like listening to a visiting professor or academic give a lecture, which is perfectly enjoyable for me, but not everyone's thing.\n\nI think I've been to a couple more but if so they've all been literally forgettable.",

(I don't understand these people, but I know that they exist)\n2. It actually depends on the podcast: 'Stuff You Missed in History Class' will rerecord things if it's too bad and all the podcasts I listen to will give a little intro that warns what the audio quality is; so they don't upsell if the recording isn't high quality.\n3. Personally I prefer if live show recordings are treated as bonuses or \"we've been sick/swamped with other work/on vacation and couldn't record a normal episode\" - apologies, I can listen to the first 5 minutes or so: listen to the intro to see if there's something to know like \"we won't be putting out new episodes for x amount of time\" and check if the audio quality is bearable and then skip if it's too bad.\n\n(edit: formatting)",

Live podcasts are never mixed well, rarely edited or cut in any way, they almost always have some visual gag or reference that doesn't play to the podcast audience, and often they feel like they're really lacking in substance... I agree completely.  Live podcasts are usually annoying.  I dislike that live podcasting has taken over the medium.  I thought it was cool when it was something you'd see for a rare, special episode, but so many podcasts have turned it into their main gig, and that is sincerely annoying to me.  You've definitely gotta find a way to monetize your art, and I like getting it for free, so I shouldn't complain... but if you're sacrificing quality to make money... of course people are going to critique it.",

People sound like they\u2019re doubling over laughing at lines that were only slightly funny, host and guest practically licking each other\u2019s shoes ... but all that really does seem awesome to the producers themselves, because they can\u2019t distinguish between their own sense of achievement and the actual enjoyability of the program. That\u2019s understandable. But this is different from the debate about advertising, because the answer isn\u2019t \u201chey, podcasts have to make money somehow, right?\u201d  Podcasts really _do_ feel like they\u2019re giving us something truly special by releasing live content, they are overvaluing the live shows, and unless more people complain about it, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever know that we actually don\u2019t like them.

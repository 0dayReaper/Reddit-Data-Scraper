A few examples I can think of are the David Holthouse (Sasquatch documentary), Siddharth Kara (African cobalt mines), and Ioan Grillo (Mexican cartels) episodes of Joe Rogan.\n\nThanks for any suggestions!",

I take any opportunity to recommend it that is even remotely appropriate.",

One of my tricks is to search for any podcast covering Slab City but I\u2019m a spoiled brat and someone just talking doesn\u2019t usually do it for me. I get this need met mostly through documentaries. \n\nAs an aside, your username made me laugh :)",

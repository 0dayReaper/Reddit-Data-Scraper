            "comment": "You'll also want to ask around r/audiodrama and r/fullcastaudiodrama. They'll be able to point you to more indie shows that sound incredible but might not have famous actors.\n\nWhat you're describing is basically most everything from [QCode](https://qcodemedia.com/shows) and [Gimlet media](https://gimletmedia.com/shows). In fact, Gimlet was behind both Homecoming and Case 63. Both studios have generally good production values and have landed some famous actors in their shows. I went googling and found [an article with some shows starring celebrities](https://podsauce.com/articles/fiction-podcasts-voiced-by-your-fave-celebs/), (apparently including Kesha??) and most of them are from those two studios. QCode also did one with Markiplier a while back ([The Edge of Sleep](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-edge-of-sleep/id1479444959)) which I heard was pretty good.\n\nI haven't listened to all of their shows, but I know the most well-liked are (from Gimlet) The Two Princes, The Horror of Dolores Roach, Quiet Part Loud, (from QCode) The Left Right Game, Borrasca, and Last Known Position. Everyone was real excited about How to Win Friends and Disappear People but idk what the reviews are yet.\n\nI would also recommend checking out Passenger List and Tomorrow's Monsters, which star Kelly Marie Tran and John Boyega respectively, both of Star Wars fame. And, I guess if you like TikTok, [Ghosthoney did a fiction podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6IYb5gZ6xHohGeTQPvSZez)...?\n\nAnd another thing! Quiet Part Loud was produced by Jordan Peele, but it was written by Mac Rogers, who has an excellent body of audio fiction work. Check out Steal the Stars, Give Me Away, and LifeAfter, as well as the studio he works with, [Gideon Media](https://www.gideon-media.com/).",

I know the more you try and convince them the more they resist. \n\nPeople by the billions believe in invisible beings in the sky that oversee their day and send them messages through old books and organizations that need their money.  \n\nNothing can stop stupid.",

It's a lack of discipline, not a lack of intellectual capacity. \n\nIt's a failing of American culture, anti-intellectualism is actually pretty traditional here, and much of it is rooted in an understanding by the religious that knowledge threatens faith. So they are willfully ignorant of anything that might potentially threaten beliefs that they hold to comfort themselves, to fit in with communities they *need* to fit in with in order to survive (comfority pressure basically) amongst other reasons. So there is certainly a tendency towards a kind of arrogant solipcism where we can belive whatever we wat to believe without regard to real world consequences of acting on those beliefs that leads to a lot of intellectual irresponsibility. *I* consider that a moral failing. If one is capable of critically thinking and reexamining one's beliefs, one has an obligation to if acting on those beliefs would effect others. If one is comforted by the belief in an afterlife that's fine, but the moment that one's actions rooted in those beliefs have real world consequence on other people then one better damn well think critically about those beliefs before doing anything.",

Problem is when you adjust the dosage for being human sized instead of an eye dropper size, the dose that would be effective in a human size would kill them.\n\nWe give ivermectin all the time in hospitals.  It's an anti parasitic that's given to a lot of people from south America that come up here.  It gets rid of parasites in you and it works great for that.  If you don't have parasites its basically inert and the equivalent of taking a Flintsones vitamin.",

Half of the shit he says is conspiratorial and it's all on spotify.\n\nedit: Reddit won't let me to respond to the below so I will add it here.  \n  \n\nUsing yourself as an example, I agree with much of what you say about his exclusivity deal....choices and consequences, totally. However, you are also dropping a few of these ones: \"Also it isn't about hurt feelings, it's about misinformation and dead people. 900,000 in the U.S. so far\"  \nWhich as I stated, is irrelevant to the topic of this thread as they are not deleting covid episodes. I kinda think it is about hurt feelings at this stage as there is no practical or medical reason to delete his eps talking shit with comics pre-covid so why bring it up several times?  \n  \nVirtue Signalling. Noun. \"the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue.\"  \n  \nMate I am Australian and I hate it when he spreads misinformation about what happened here in the pandemic (amongst other things), its just wrong. But it's irrelevant to this topic. There is a lot more to like about the podcast than dislike (imho, as a long time listener). But leave the virtue signalling out of it. We know the pandemic is bad. But listen to some fun pods, or Yeonmi Park or Randall Carlson or Sanjay Gupta https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/13/health/sanjay-gupta-joe-rogan-experience/index.html",

Private entities have always been allowed to limit your speech. Don't like it? You're free to not use their services and go elsewhere. That's how this free market capitalism shit works. If you say stupid shit, you're going to win stupid prizes, like getting episodes of your podcast removed. Society doesn't have to be tolerant of every single thing, every single person says.",

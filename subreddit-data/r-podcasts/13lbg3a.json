(I'm using the term \"definitely\" in a casual manner. I of course, can't diagnose them).\n\nI do feel a bit confused by the show though. I've listened to every episode of the season and the host just mentioned how the doctor should have reported them if it's Munchausen's. He made the comment as though this had been referenced in a previous episode. Have I missed something?",

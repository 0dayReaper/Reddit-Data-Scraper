It's an audiodrama where the premise is the protagonist/narrator is trapped in a malevolent city where things are just...not quite right.  It gives me backrooms vibes because it really nails the sense of isolation and general *wrongness* you feel when encountering something that looks normal but feels anything but.  (Though more often than not the horror is more overt, one overarching theme is the protagonist's sense that he's the only one who realizes things are out of place.)",

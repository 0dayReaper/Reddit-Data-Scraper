    "postText": "Hey, there! I\u2019m just about done with Limetown season 1 and LOVE it, but I\u2019ve seen quite a few comments here and elsewhere that Limetown S2 isn\u2019t great, and is pretty incoherent. Is it still worth listening to, do you think, if I like S1? Or should I just live with the finale and not continue?\n\nJust because it\u2019s not as good doesn\u2019t mean I should skip it entirely, so I wasn\u2019t sure. Thank you!",

It didn't really feel like a continuation or expansion of anything from the first season, except the basic premise of the lore, and I liked it alright as its own thing.",

I think many folks hated the ending but\u2026.I liked it and felt it fit what the show was about.  \n\nWhy not listen and judge for yourself?   Just know it does go a different path and if you have a set expectation for how the story should end you may well be disappointed.",

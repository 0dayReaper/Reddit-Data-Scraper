    "postText": "My son enjoys listening to the Thomas and friends podcast with his Yoto player. He wants to be able to listen to it in the car which means I need to download the mp3 files for each episode (in order to put them on a Yoto card so he can be independent with it, vs me starting the playback from my phone) \n\nI know I can use ListenNotes to download the mp3 for each episode but there are 107 episodes to this podcast, to download each episode from ListenNotes would be very tedious! Anyone know of a way to download ALL episodes from a podcast in a single click (or a few clicks)?",

It\u2019s not without some tedium but I just multitask while downloading each file and then select all and move to an MP3 player sometimes when I want a break from my phone.",

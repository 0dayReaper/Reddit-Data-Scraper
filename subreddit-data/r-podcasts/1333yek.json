You may get better answers over in r/audiodrama.\n\nMy only real suggestions are the abundance of actual play RPG podcasts, such as Critical Role, The Adventure Zone, Not Another D&amp;D Podcast, and hundreds more. These are probably  more comedic and improvised than you're looking for, but they scratch the itch for me.",

Anyway, I scoured my podcast library and I can't figure out which episode weirded me out.   It may have been an Earth Ancients episode, actually.   I'm pretty sure the guest was Dr John Brandenburg.   Could he be a kook?   Google \"evidence of nuclear explosion on Mars\"  and you will get the general idea.   This is a very entertaining idea even if you find it hard to believe.",

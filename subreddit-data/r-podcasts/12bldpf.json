    "postText": "Are there any good, comprehensive podcasts about the history of the Christian church? I am looking for something the goes into how we got to all the denominations we have now across the world.  What political, theological, and cultural clashes led to this?\n\nI\u2019ve listened to history of the papacy, history in the Bible, and literature and history and they do a good job of the early church but I\u2019m looking for something that goes to the modern times as well.",

            "comment": "The absolute best resource for this isn't a podcast, it's a book that you can get in an audio format. I know it's not what you're asking for, but I used to teach this stuff and this book is freaking amazing.\n\nChristianity: The First Three Thousand Years by Diarmaid McCulloch. You can get it free by signing up with Audible for a month or your local library might have it.\n\nHe starts with the ancient Hebrews and works his way into the modern world in pretty incredible detail. It's the densest and biggest book I've ever read that somehow still manages to feel like an overview. It left me wanting to look into something more in depth many times.\n\nI can rec some excellent texts for the old and new testament, but the only podcast is recommend right now is Bart Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus. It deals with biblical scholarship which is really fundamental to getting a well-reasoned view of the Bible. The last episode was an excellent one on the gospel of Mark.",

Season 1 is about the \u201cToronto Blessing\u201d, the movement she was raised in. Season 2 is about Bethel Church.",

    "postText": "I love the Moth, but sometimes the stories can get pretty dark. Which is honestly awesome that it's such a broad range of topics and styles of storytelling, but sometimes I'm not in the mood for a heavy story.\n\nThis is Not Happening is a fantastic show where comedians tell stories from their lives, so if that was a podcast I would totally listen. Anyway, that's in the ballpark area of what I want. Stories, but no tearjerkers.",

So I just listen to the Classic Risk or Best Of episodes which are pretty good. \n\nSome stories I've heard have really stuck with me. Like the guy who was an agent working in child sex crimes and how he went to a house to rescue two kids and he almost shot the guy in the head and how the poor kids talked to them afterwards. Very sad stuff, heart breaking. \n\nTheir scary stories are top notch.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m definitely left leaning, but I get tired of hearing the same shit all the time. \n\nHere are my recommendations. Not all of them are the same as the moth, but similar story telling programs. Short Cuts, Selected Shorts, Radio Diaries, Sideways, Side Door, The Document, The Stoop, Undiscovered, Unfictional, and last but not least, Strangeville was great.\n\nEdit: I can recommend more if you\u2019re into some of these, let me know. Good luck.",

            "comment": "Moth is quality. L+R too. First of all work back through all the classic This American Life. Maybe get some Reply All classics going. Its typically funny and engaging too. Heavyweight can occasionally deal with heavier stuff, but in a humorous and light way (really excellent pod). Radiolab from the science episodes is best (they went through a phase of topics around race/gender/sexuality/feminist stuff for a while that just didn't tickle my interest like the earlier stuff.. I had no problem with the general ideas conveyed but they bored the arse off me). 99 percent invisible is ALWAYS worth a listen. It will be listened to by me as soon as it is out. Memory Palace for beautiful little vignettes of history with a personal touch (there is an episode on the vietnam draft that is just brilliant brilliant brilliant). There are two guys in Ireland called \"The 2 Johnnies\" and honestly it is fucking hilarious most of the time. The correspondence and humourous tackling of subjects makes it (listen to \"the GAA catfish\" first.. mad shit).",

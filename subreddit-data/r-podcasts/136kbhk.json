I really like it, but not sure if I'll be able to keep up with the whole stories as I listen at work and can miss things. I'm wondering if anybody can reccomend some podcasts that are just short fiction stories about monsters/cryptids/paranormal things. Length ranging from 20 to 90 minutes.",

Other than that, maybe Neighbourly could be a good fit for you? It\u2019s about this weird neighbourhood and it goes from house to house and it\u2019s really weird and sometimes horror-y and other times quite sweet and I found it oddly calming and really interesting",

But more horror (often but I guess not always paranormal) include: \n\n* Pseudopod (my personal favorite) \n* Nightmare Magazine \n* Nightlight \n* Creepy (has some decent stories but also a lot of pretty bad ones in my opinion). \n* The Wicked Library (Haven't listened in years but people like it. I think the stories were fine but I got annoyed with the host going on a weird rant about how he hated trigger warnings) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDrabblecast does \"weird\" or slipstream fiction which often involves monsters. \n\nPodcastle is fantasy, so also involves monsters and magic though not usually in the horror sense. \n\nI have many other speculative short fiction podcasts that I love but since I'm already drifting away from paranormal I'll stop there.",

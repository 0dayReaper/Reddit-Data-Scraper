    "postText": "Hi, I'm looking for podcasts that discuss societal issues that affect men disproportionately. Things like higher suicide rates, higher levels of loneliness, lower academic attainment, lower life expectancy.\n\nAre there any non Jordan Peterson-esque podcasts that discuss these things academically? I'm not interested in anything that is trying to push an agenda, I just want to learn more. Would love it if there was a female host / co-host.\n\nMany thanks!",

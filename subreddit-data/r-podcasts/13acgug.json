    "postText": "I don\u2019t know what made me think of this now but at least a year ago there were two Newfie\u2019s interviewed on Q with Tom Power about their podcast. It was about life in Newfoundland and from what I can recall was reasonably funny. \n\nI\u2019ve searched all the keywords I can think of and nothing. It must have been big enough or unique enough to make it to Q programming\u2026?\nThanks!",

It's possible that the podcast just didn't gain as much popularity as some of the others out there. Either way, it's always a bummer when you can't find something you remember enjoying. Hope you come across it soon!",

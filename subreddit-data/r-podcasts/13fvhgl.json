The problem with a lot of these podcasts is that they often fall under the bigoted sexist toxic grindset category. And I would very much prefer to avoid stuff and harmful ideas like that.

I almost want to describe it like therapy in a podcast; obviously it\u2019s not like *actual* therapy, as that\u2019s a very personalized thing, but the type of content it deals with is very \u201cunderstanding and managing your emotions in a healthy way.  \n\nMy therapist recommended it to me because I\u2019ve spoken a lot about valuing communication and connection with other people, which is a big part of what Brown talks about.",

Not in an Andrew Tate \"go fuck bitches\" kind of way, but in a \"how do we reconcile masculinity with the world we live in?\" way. Young men really need that, especially those without strong male figures in their lives.\n\nThe core principles of \"manliness\" according to the site are: protect those weaker than you, since you have a biological advantage, provide for those weaker than you, since you have a biological advantage, and do your part to bring up other young people to do the same, since they need that done for them. \n\nMen, I hate to say it, need role models. We need direction. The Art of Manliness is trying to provide that in a non toxic, non bro way. Let men have a place to learn to be better.",

They tend to be more geared towards clinicians but there's some helpful/interesting therapy stuff in there too.\n\nI've heard \"Recovery FOR The Narcissist\" is a great one too. Yeah it's geared towards people with NPD/narcissistic traits specifically, but we all have toxic qualities and the capacity to abuse others, and we all have room for improvement. The episodes look quite interesting and I've heard the host is a very kind and empathetic guy.",

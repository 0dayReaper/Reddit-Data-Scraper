At the moment, it's about the Iron Age Mediterranean.\n\nA Short History Of... could be what you're looking for. About an hour spent on each topic, so you get a broad overview.\n\nI'd also recommend The Rest is History, which has two historians talking about a variety of different topics, ranging from the 100 Years War to historical fiction to the CIA.",

Although missing any voice actors or sound effects. \n\nIf you want more shortform content, I quite like Betwixt the Sheets, In Our Time and The Ancients. All of these are non scripted. The host invites 1 or more guests to talk about a specific topic for 30-60 minutes or so. \n\nSomething exactly like Fall of Civs is hard to come by, it's quite unique.",

That's like pausing a 3h movie at the 1h mark and continuing the next day, and pretending it's a 3 episode series. You *could*, but it's not ideal. \n\nIn a hypothetical world, if I found a 3+ hr podcast on a topic that is very interesting to me, and that is literally the *only* content on the topic (no other podcast, no books), I might give the \"pause and come back later\" a try. But in the real world, pretty much every topic I am interested in has alternatives - so I choose to consume media targeted towards my listening preferences, rather than wrestling with something that wasn't.\n\nEdit: You also asked how is it different if the podcast was released as multiple episodes. To me, the difference is in style and organization. Movies are *styled* differently than TV series, the story telling is just different. And 3h long episodes feel like a paragraph running to 10 pages. Sure *some* people might like that style - but it ain't my cup of tea. If you won't use paragraph breaks, I'll do my best to avoid reading your stuff. My brain doesn't work too well without visible structure \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

When you start a book do you read it cover to cover in one sitting? Probably not. And using my Dan Carlin example again he (and other podcasters) break a long episode into \u201cchapters\u201d to make it easier to listen to because they know very few people will listen to a multi hour podcast in one sitting.",

However the experience/feel of stopping will differ based on the media format. You may not care about the difference, doesn't mean everybody else in the universe feels that way.",

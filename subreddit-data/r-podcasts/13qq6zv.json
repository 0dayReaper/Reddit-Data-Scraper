    "postText": "Friends, I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm looking for podcasts that are smart and joyous and that release regularly so I don't have to keep finding new ones. What's smart and joyous? I really like food podcasts like The Sporkful and Gastropod, and Big Picture Science is informative and goofy. Comedy is hit-or-miss; it's hard to find someone's exact flavor of comedy and when it goes bad it goes real bad. What tends not to be joyous is true crime, news, and politics.\n\nI've heard a lot of great podcast series based on the recs of this sub, but then they're over as soon as they started and it's back to trying to find something new.\n\nI appreciate internet strangers bringing audio joy into my life, thank you, thank you!",

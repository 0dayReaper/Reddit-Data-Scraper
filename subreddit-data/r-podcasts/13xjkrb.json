But with the exception of OP3, those data are not public.\n\nI wish it weren't the case, but download data isn't public, and the services that \"estimate\" downloads are, in my opinion, suspect.\n\n(Though I argue that downloads isn't the right metric to track, but now I'm pontificating, and I turned in my pundit badge!)",

I usually listen to it to go to sleep and it scared the living SHIT out of me.  I immediately dropped it like a hot potatoes.  Their quality was getting worse anyway \ud83d\ude21\n\nBesides that, although some podcasts had great content, I just couldn\u2019t get jiggy with some British accent.  It just doesn\u2019t rub me the right way and I have to pay extra attention to clarify what they\u2019re saying rather than passively listen.",

Once Mosier became infrequent on SModcast I tuned out of that and the rest, I just gradually lost interest with time as my tastes changed. Also Kev started repeating stories a lot...",

I get they need to make money but one show in particular is taking full segments and removing them to Patreon only feeds.

They release like one a day and each episode is automatically loaded into every Parcast feed (so if you\u2019re subscribed to 3 of their shows you get to download the same shitty clip show 3x). \n\nIt\u2019s so petty but I really hate having to go in every couple of days to delete all of those crappy little mini episodes one by one from each feed.\n\nParcast shows in general are pretty polarizing due to their robotic style and over production, but I\u2019ve never minded that so much. But this hassle is what got me to unsubscribe and move on from their work. Why would any podcast network do this? I understand occasionally sending out an ad or previews for your other shows the way Wondery does, but the \u201cBites\u201d approach is obnoxious.",

            "comment": "Making every episode a two-part episode!!! That\u2019s how it is with everything that\u2019s released on the Parcast Network!\n(Gone, Conspiracy Theories, Assassinations, Hostage, Unexplained, Unsolved, etc..)\n\nYou don\u2019t need to make every episode a two part episode! If you don\u2019t have time or content to make a weekly episode, release them every-other week.  Or if nothing else, release the second part the next day! \n\nI don\u2019t remember enough about the prior episode a week later to follow along with part two, so I end up having to re listen to part one (which I assume is why they do it, because it gives them higher play counts and download counts) but I don\u2019t want to listen to part one again, so it either becomes a chore, or I skip part two. But worst is when an episode starts playing on its own after something else finished. Then I get really interested, only to have it stop halfway thru. \n\nI had to unsubscribe to all of them. Sometimes I\u2019ll go back and binge some, but that\u2019s become more and more rare.  It\u2019s a shame because they are really well produced otherwise.",

The episode was about Tracy Tam, a transgender murder victim, whose killer tried using the gay panic defence. I think pretty much everyone agrees that defence is BS, and that\u2019s the approach the podcast took. However, after quoting a doctor (pathologist, I think) who said Tracy was successfully post-surgery and appeared cisgender, the host insinuated that the killer must\u2019ve been experienced with transgender genitalia since he could tell she was trans. I haven\u2019t listened to the podcast since, although I was a regular listener before. Spending an episode tearing apart the gay panic defence, then implying this homophobic individual is secretly gay, just makes you part of the problem.",

I suggest people to have an email just for things like newsletters (mine is for coupons and newsletters so my regular emails don't get bogged up) but skimming newsletters is a way to know what's most likely new. Everyone has a different taste and style, too. So you can start learning who your tastes match up with.\n\n[Greatpods](https://greatpods.co) is also on there for a newsletter but they also have a \"Coming Soon\" reel on their website that they've worked to develop.\n\nI will second the Pocketcasts Discovery - I really enjoy it as my player and it's a solid price for a yearly subscription.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: misplaced ()",

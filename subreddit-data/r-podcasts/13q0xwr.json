Are there any other podcasts like this? \n\nOr if there are any music podcasts that mention the recording process or do deep dives on an artist\u2019s life? Might be asking for a lot here lol",

You can tell he works so hard and he does an amazing job and he keeps getting better at it. That Grateful Dead episode was so unexpected and brilliant in so many ways. I get the impression he's more disciplined than Tyler Mahan Coe (Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones) but both of them have this wonderful, not exactly perfectionist, mindset, but they want to deliver really good, original content, deadlines be damned, and I support them both no matter how long it takes.",

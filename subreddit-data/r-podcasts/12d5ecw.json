    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'm on the search to find a podcast episode on a subject of a hidden affair recorded on video cassette. It was like a toxic relationship between two people during the 1960's or earlier about a man that would exchange voice recordings with a women that loved him and never remarried, only to die alone but they would exchange video tapes about the experience. Often this women was crying and frustrated, I heard it on the radio this year on NPR",

Is a really funny historical fiction about Edith Wilson, wife of Woodrow Wilson who secretly ran the country while he was bedridden, starring Rosamund Pike. \n\nThe Loudest Girl In The World is funny and has lots of heart, its about the host's journey of being diagnosed with autism as an adult.\n\nEverything Jamie Loftus has made is great - start with her podcast My Year In Mensa, it's only 4 episodes long. She also co-hosts a film chat show called the Bechdel Cast.\n\nEdit to add: I can't believe I forgot to mention Normal Gossip. They launched less than a year ago but its been a word of mouth hit. Listeners send in normal everyday gossip from their lives and the host tells the stories to the guests. It's often very low stakes and petty, and very funny. The host Kelsey McKinney is really good at storytelling. Check out the most recent episode with Samin Nosrat.",

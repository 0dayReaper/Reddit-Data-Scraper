    "postText": "I wasn\u2019t into podcasts at all, until my co-worker/friend suggest The Horror Virgin to me and I love it. The three hosts have amazing chemistry. It\u2019s clear they are really great friends that love making each other laugh. I super dig that energy and have exhausted their back catalogue, as well as their other pod Romancing The Pod, and I need some more pods to work into the rotation. The problem is, a lot of movie pod hosts don\u2019t have great chemistry. Can you all suggest some other movie podcast that will scratch that itch.",

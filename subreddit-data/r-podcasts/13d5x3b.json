If I recall, he had him on twice. Both were great.  Miesha Tate was another standout primarily because they talked about so many other things than mma and she was a great conversationalist. George Saint Pierre might be third, just because of the sheer crazy that seems to live behind the superhero persona that is him. \n\nThe rest all kind of run together. If you love mma, they all will have some value, but a lot of them are heavy on the self-promotion and therefore not all that interesting.",

I use the Apple Podcasts app and I open that whenever I want to listen and browse my subscriptions and usually I can find something I want to listen to. It just never occurs to me to open a second app to look",

You may look forward to a new season of a good one or reflect back on a great episode, but, in general, they are something people listen to on \"auto\" and don't put a ton of thought into finding.",

It seems like we're debating semantics: are podcasts defined by a historically-unchanging standard (RSS feeds and a spirit of openness and freedom), or is the definition fluid enough to be updated to include new cases (spotify's walled garden model)?\n\nUnfortunately, the debate won't be settled by a few idealistic power-users, but by the average user. There is no podcasting council to issue a ruling. The average listener doesn't think about or know about any of this stuff...a podcast is just any speech-based audio program that can be played on demand.",

But podcasts aren\u2019t that way except for Spotify (as far as I am aware), so on principle, we shouldn\u2019t encourage this behavior, because it will only encourage more companies to do this.

I think that it is too absolutely no one\u2019s advantage to limit the availability of quality content. \n\nI do appreciate that Spotify needs to make a buck. And that I want Spotify to be successful and be independent of the giants like Apple and Amazon. \n\nI would argue that it is in the best interest of Spotify and the community if they had content on time limited exclusivity.  If they want to pay Obama/Rogan/whoever they should do it in the basis of keeping it exclusive for four weeks, then allowing it to be published freely. \n\nThe period should be long enough for Spotify to benefit from ads during the peak of the interest for new content, but not enough to prevent others from discovering the show. Fans who have keen interest in the podcast can get Spotify. But eventually anyone who wants to listen can listen on anything. \n\nPerhaps the exclusive period needs to be longer that four weeks. Four months then.  But it is to everybody\u2019s interest that the podcast world doesn\u2019t become fragmented and become a market of tech giants bidding ridiculous amounts for exclusivity. \n\nLowering the market expectation for these podcast contracts will also keep Spotify from paying too much for personalities such as Joe Rogan. \n\nI support Spotify and recommend their premium subscription to others. But I don\u2019t want to feel that I need depend on it for all my podcasts. Or have to explain how to use different podcast apps to family members.",

A consistent income/payout for smaller podcasters seems like a good deal especially because it\u2019s difficult for unknowns to get sponsors. My friend and I upload through anchor which Spotify owns and they offer a sponsorship to every new podcast (based on cpm of course), but that is pennys for most. I\u2019d also assume that going exclusive to Spotify would be nice because they probably do more to promote it since they are invested in its success. It seems like a way to allow shows to sustainably produce content. This is all from my understanding of how it works so if I\u2019m wrong let me know.",

I recommend Mp3DirectCut (Win 10 app) for editing podcasts.",

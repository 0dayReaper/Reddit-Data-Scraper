    "postText": "I'm interested in history, but would love podcasts more focused on different aspects of culture and/or daily life during different time periods, or how those things have evolved. Things like travel, food, recreation, socializing, fashion, celebrations, dating, etc throughout history! Open to any time periods or areas, specific episodes or series!\n\nMore specifically, I've read a number of articles lately on things like the tradition of the European Grand Tour, how restaurants evolved, how historical events have affected fashion, how beaches came to be vacation spots, and more -- and they've all been fascinating! I'd love to find a podcast that touches on similar topics.",

I wouldn't necessarily say it's a history podcast, but history is part of how certain foods or types of restaurants are explained (but not always, some things are fairly current). Gravy is also really well-down, somewhat more emphasis on the history, but also just the one food theme and even more narrow than Gastropod (southern US only).",

They have episodes about drugs, food, hygiene etc. Or Betwixt the Sheets - on sex and society related topics throughout history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaven't listened to the second one yet but feel either of these may be up your street!",

    "postText": "If you like true crime/investigative podcasts, a really good one to listen to is Cousins by Blood, which explores the conviction and sentencing to death of Ivan Cantu for the 2000 murder of his cousin James Mosqueda and his fianc\u00e9e Amy Kitchen. \n\nCantu\u2019s execution date is looming and in my opinion there is great doubt as to whether he did it. However, more importantly, I believe that the case was botched due to false testimony, iffy evidence, and very poor defence. \n\nThe podcaster, Matt Duff, is calling for those who believe Cantu was wrongfully convicted to speak out, by reaching out to the governor of Texas among others. As I\u2019m not American, I\u2019m not sure that my input would have much use. However, both in the name of justice and as a fascinating listen, I\u2019d like to spread the word while there is (hopefully) still time for things to change. \n\nIf anyone has already listened and has a different opinion on the case, I\u2019d also love to hear it - I by no means think my opinion is infallible, although I do not believe in the death penalty under any circumstances. \n\nTL;DR - listen to Cousins by Blood to determine for yourself if Ivan Cantu deserves the death penalty.",

    "postText": "It's a podcast about empires and colonization hosted by two accomplished authors and historians. It's exposed me to a part of history I was never really taught that much about in American schools. I'm towards the end of the first season about the British colonization of India. It begins with arrival of the East India Company and it ends with the creation of the Indian nation state/Pakistan. It's one of the most engaging history podcasts I've listened to in quite a while.  So many stories that are horrific, tragic, and inspiring. The second series is about the Ottomans.",

I too love Dalrymple\u2019s writing.  \n\nOther good history podcasts: *Revolutions* (15-100 episode long seasons on the English, American, French, Haiti, July, 1848, Mexican, and Russian Revolutions). \n\n*Fall of Civilizations* (single 2-4 hour long episodes on the rise and fall of various civilizations)\n\n*Tides of History* (start from season 4, which is 100 plus episodes taking you from the beginning of pre-history to the Late Bronze Age Collapse, covering not just the Near East and China but doing things like looking at the development of agriculture in North, South and Meso America, New Guinea, the Near East, and East Asia possibly twice. Season 5 picks up where Season 4 left off, going into the Iron Age. Choose random episodes that seem interesting if you want to know if this is your style or just jump into \u201cStone, Bone, and Genomes: Understanding Humanity\u2019s Deep Past\u201d from July 20, 2020 if you want to start at the start of Season 4. Just absolutely fantastic.)",

The hosts and various  guests are incredibly intelligent and obviously extremely interested in the subject.      \n\nAs an American who loves English literature, the idea of \"expanding the empire\" was a common trope that I just accepted without ever considering the flipside;  the story from the POV of the colonized themselves.     \n\nThe symmetry to many American's blind spot regarding American history is so obvious that I can't believe that I never considered British colonial rule with the same scrutiny.     \n\nSeason 2 has less of a direct line to feeling relevant to me personally, but has been incredibly enjoyable and educational nonetheless.",

How could a gang of \u201cspectacularly corrupt\u201d merchants conquer vast parts of Asia from a small office in London with just 35 employees? And how did the company\u2019s actions pave the way for British government rule in India\u201d\n\n\nAnother one I liked, not Dalrymple, is about the Dutch East India Company (kinda a complementary look at the a similar European colonial exploitation history but with a different nation in a different geography) \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-our-time/id73330895?i=1000364114731\n\n\n\u201c Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC, known in English as the Dutch East India Company. The VOC dominated the spice trade between Asia and Europe for two hundred years, with the British East India Company a distant second. At its peak, the VOC had a virtual monopoly on nutmeg, mace, cloves and cinnamon, displacing the Portuguese and excluding the British, and were the only European traders allowed access to Japan.

While I love William Dalrymple's humble yet knowledgeable contributions, I am finding his co-host Anita Anand increasingly insufferable.  Her constant \"in-jokes\" and general smugness significantly decrease the informational content of the episodes, and at this stage they've become so annoying that I'm probably not going to bother with their third series (about slavery).  \nShame, because once again the subject matter sounds fascinating.",

    "postText": "Ok, so I desperately want to find a podcast that is like when your friend(s) rants chaotically but passionately about a show/movie/book/fic that they have recently enjoyed. You know where they like explain the plot, what they though was cool, who they ship, why x character is so dumb actually, speculations, etc. To the point where you understand the media without having ever seen/read it but also your talking to your friend so it's a fun and lighthearted time instead of it being a lecture.\nSome examples of kinda what I mean is the podcast Potterless (https://open.spotify.com/show/29cTq6BeY4H2HLf15Ul5XQ?si=E0CvWfMiSmOUJgEs-6WSZw) where a guy read all the Harry Potter books for the first time and talked about his thoughts and feelings as he went, or Into the Twilight (https://open.spotify.com/show/2NgvmFn5M2iVTSAbSBDnrb?si=hznkEJqCQqm6r_tmfM5sOw) where two hosts do the same thing with the twilight books. Some video essayists do something similar, like Quinton Reviews or Mike's Mic.\nAs you can see, I've found what I can, but person ranting about thing(s) they enjoy isn't exactly a genre of podcast or something easily looked up. If y'all know of any podcasts like this please lmk!",

It wasn't for me but there's also [All About Agatha (Christie)](https://pod.link/1155061645) which dives into her books.\n\nYou're probably better off searching for specific media that interests you + podcast - seems like everyone and their dog has a podcast chatting to their friends about their favourite tv show/movie/book.",

It's hosted by Mike Nelson from Mystery Science Theater and a co-writer for Rifftrax, Connor Lastowka. It's not so much about hating the books as it is riffing them in a way similar to MST3k, if you're familiar with that. It's really fun, the hosts chemistry is great, the riffing is funny and it's never particularly mean-spirited. They start with *Ready Player One* and go on to quite a few more, with a good mix of best sellers and strange self-published stuff.",

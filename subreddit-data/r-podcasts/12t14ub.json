Really just a regular one I\u2019d imagine but with explanations. Wouldn\u2019t mind a history of baseball one either!\n\nIdeally funny too!",

Talkin\u2019 Baseball has three episodes a week with two being series recaps and one being a topics episode. Both are great for learning about the game and keeping up with what\u2019s going on in it. Great humor involved with both. \n\nAnything baseball-related by Jomboy Media is my go-to really. Bunch of good shit with them!",

That said, it unfortunately spends a lot of time \"in the weeds\" of advanced concepts and assumes a good deal of prior baseball knowledge. \n\nI mention it only to encourage you to check it out at some point in the future. Also, the book that the host wrote, \"The Only Rule Is It Has to Work\", was phenomenal and a wonderful read for any baseball fan.",

Starkville by Jayson Stark and Doug Glanville is especially good.\n\nThe Tony Kornheiser podcast is a general sports and news podcast, but he usually has on either Jeff Passan, Tim Kurkjian, or Mark Feinsand of MLB Network. They try to keep things simple. So, I would recommend trying it if they are mentioned in the guest segments.",

They really used the concept of sound in a way most podcasts haven't. It totally immersed you in the world of the story. They also covered more actual science related topics as opposed to social or political. Jad once said something about how the original idea of Radiolab was that they would use sound (not just people talking) as a tool for understanding the experiment/story. A great example is the episode on color, which has won a ton of awards for its production.\n\nNowadays the episodes are half as long and seem rarely science based, the use of sound as an experience has all but disappeared. It's just not what the show was set up to be. I like Lulu and Latif just fine, it's the original formula of the podcast that has just gone missing.",

In fact - I think that under-rates it. \n\nI think it is one of the best pieces of pop journalism ever. It is a gripping story, masterfully told, with a lot of humour and novelty (for instance - spoiler: &gt;!recording the song from memory and playing it to the original artist! !&lt; What a brilliant idea).\n\nOn the surface it\u2019s a low stakes story. The \u201cmissing hit\u201d is just another piece of cultural flotsam, and by definition not a particularly important one.\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s a more serious piece of investigative journalism in there about how our pop culture is made. \n\nAnd even more brilliantly, the episode reveals something we hadn\u2019t realised about our own universal experience of consuming and discarding our culture, and experiencing our own lives. It\u2019s a story we all share and it seems obvious - we experience stuff and we forget it. But we all share those occasional moments of looking back and wondering about a hazy memory of an experience. They found the words to describe that so completely, when until that moment I would have struggled to hold that idea in my mind.\n\nAnd they conveyed the enormity of that in this wonderful, deftly told, light-hearted narrative (it\u2019s a little more accessible than, say, Proust\u2019s madeleines - which appear at the beginning of a 1 million+ word novel.)\n\nEvery second of it was genius. RIP Reply All but man, that one episode is a legacy in itself.",

I'd recommend everyone here to check out these episodes, as well as some of the many entertaining wrestling \"shoot interviews\" on Youtube. Even if you're not a wrestling fan, you'll find them highly entertaining replayable.",

Tells the story of how a small Vermont community moves forward after an unspeakable loss, while heart-breaking it also has strong elements of love and grace, incredibly well produced by a one woman podcast operation\n\n\\- The Moth \"[Flight\"](https://themoth.org/stories/flight) an young skier saves the day as a toddler hurtles down a ski mountain on an out of control sled, a funny story told with great style and wit.",

You have to spend **EVERY. LAST. CENT.** And make a movie that is so bad it's good. If the movie makes a profit, you get to keep the profits. What movie do you make, who do you cast, etc?\n\nThis kicks off a tremendous in-joke about a fictional movie franchise that has lasted for YEARS and even got a wiki based on spinoffs, sequels, and wild stories that the hosts and various listeners came up with.\n\nEpisode 36, \"Frank and the problems with the Liberty Sphere,\" the regular hosts have a guest from their mutuals come on to discuss what military life would be like in Star Wars if it were portrayed realistically, according to their respective experiences in the US armed forces. They also discuss the reason why GONK droids are actually terrifying. I still laugh pretty consistently.",

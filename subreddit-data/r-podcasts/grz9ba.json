My guess is that movies and television create certain expectations of what people look like based on their voice.\n\nIt's the one thing you're watching where stereotypes always play out. The sexy woman never/rarely has a bad voice. The guy with the high pitched voice is always the nerdy guy. The guy with the deep voice is always the cool/suave guy.\n\nIn reality, voice has nothing to do with how you look physically and can match any type of voice with any type of look. Real life plays against type, media plays directly to type.\n\nI also think our expectations of media is that celebrities are good looking, that is the nature of the world. Then you see a successful podcaster in real life and see that they're exactly the opposite of what the world sets our expectations to be.\n\nIt really should make you wonder what other assumptions you're making based on things you rarely/never think about or consider. All this stuff is baked in our brains through consumption and upbringing.",

They ended up knowing them well enough to introduce me and I got to meet them (I would compare my reaction to how I would probably handle meeting Tom Hanks). I'll never forget how awesome and down to earth they were (you always hear don't meet your hero's).\n\nFunny thing is I had them wrong. The guy who had the deep voice with the booming laugh was the tallest and lankiest bastard I have ever seen and the other guy was short and almost round (not fat but because he had a barrel chest with being so short it was more of an illusion).",

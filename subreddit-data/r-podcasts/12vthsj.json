    "postText": "Hello! If this isn't ment to be here please just take it down but I've been trying to find a specific sleep podcast where the person reads bedtime stories of famous book (specifically on Spotify) and I just haven't been able to do so since it won't show up in my history and it's been a good few months! \n\nHere is what I remember from it, the voice was male, he was very quiet and collected, didn't have any noticable accident, in his \"intro\" he talked about alcohol anonymous and how much it helped him and if you're struggling with any mental health issues you should reach out to someone, he went on to read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein I think? I can't quite remember since the podcast did its job quite well. \n\nIf anyone knows of the podcast I'm talking about I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",

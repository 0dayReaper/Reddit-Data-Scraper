    "postText": "Since moving from Android to iPhone i\u2019ve been trying out different podcast apps and lately Castro piqued my interest with its Inbox feature.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been wondering - is there a way of marking episodes as \u201cplayed\u201d manually? I\u2019m subscribed to a bunch of podcasts that have a lot of episodes that I haven\u2019t listened to completely before switching apps. It\u2019s possible to do it in Pocket Casts, Overcast, even Apple Podcasts, but I couldn\u2019t find a way to do it in Castro.\nIt\u2019s only possible to move the episodes from Inbox to Library, but then there\u2019s no distinction between episode I\u2019ve already listened to and the ones I haven\u2019t (unless I actually listened to the episode in Castro). The only way I see is to put all the unplayed episodes to Queue but then I think it kind of defeats the whole \u201cInbox-Queue (if I want to listen now)-Library (if I want to listen later)\u201d system.",

            "comment": "I believe you can mark them as played by swiping either left or right. Just an FYI though the app is no longer really being actively maintained and can\u2019t sync to some very popular podcasts like This American Life, and their syncing system will occasionally just ignore a new podcast and not show it in the inbox or playlist unless you manually refresh that feed. \n\nCastro used to be the best podcast app there was on iOS but the original developers sold it to another company that has let it fall into disrepair. I\u2019d suggest sticking with Overcast or something with active developers behind it.",

I don\u2019t think there is a way to mark a podcast as \u201clistened to\u201d manually though. Hope that\u2019s not a dealbreaker for you. Maybe you can request the feature?",

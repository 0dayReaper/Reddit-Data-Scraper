    "postText": " \n\nSo for years I have been downloading the MP3 of a radio show onto my desktop (windows 10). I manually import it into iTunes, then I update the file type (\"media kind\") to \"podcast\" . I would then find the podcast in my \"download\" tab in itunes.   The actual MP3 file would be on my phone hard drive as I could listen even without an internet connection.  \n\nFor the past week, the shows appear in my download folder for a few hours and then randomly disappear! I have repeated the process multiple times and they still disappear.\n\nLooking for help fixing itunes or advice on how to import this radio show into my iPhone without using itunes if necessary.",

            "comment": "Same, but I download them all from itunes and just manually copy the podcast mp3 over.  Had a bunch on there and 90% just randomly disappeared.  I could still see them on my phone when I looked at my itunes phone podcast list.  Went through a huge process writing them all down so I wouldn't miss any, re-downloading them, copying them back over.  Today I added a bunch more and they all just disappeared.  I suspect maybe it's going over a certain limit, but my phone isn't anywhere near full.\n\nThe iPhone storage thing shows 12GB for the Podcast app, the Downloaded shows completely empty.  iTunes now shows empty too.\n\nGonna go get PocketCasts or something and not trust it ever again.",

    "postText": "I listened to an episode of a podcast that was created by a pianist. He talked through a lot of it with soft piano in the background. It was like a guided meditation. I cannot for the life of me find it and it really helped me out through a hard time with my mental health. \n\nI think the person was Canadian (if not, American). \n\nDoes anyone know which podcast I\u2019m thinking of? \nThanks!",

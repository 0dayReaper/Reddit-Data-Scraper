    "postText": "I love eye opening podcast episodes, maybe spiritual, self help, inner healing, everyday life, live events, science, maybe comedy, maybe pure entertainment. It takes a lot for me to stick with a good podcast, so i would love to see some suggestions. I have seen a lot of these threads and have been through many episodes!\n\nEdit*** here are some of mine (i love deep thinking and spiritual type genre right now)\n\nThe inner landscape of Beauty- John O\u2019Donohue speaking about how healing stepping into nature can be \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/4gzzImBlp1rDvtzMg03g6E?si=Et6srvu_RbGj65oqt0H5WA\n\n\nNick bare- The power of commitment. This man has truly changed my life. He is the perfect example of a leader, family man, and buisness owner. As a woman, he has set my standards so high and his podcasts are invaluable, especially his older solo episodes. Ex military, hybrid athlete who focuses on fitness and business ownership. \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-nick-bare-podcast/id1469466722?i=1000586931458\n\nBedros Keulian: Rules of the game (of life.)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dUX3LZXpcrI\n\n\n\nJay shetty and Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9 - the root cause of trauma and why you feel lost in life. Again, another gem of a podcast. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/OTQJmkXC2EI\n\n\nRandom but throwing Call Her Daddy episode 47. CHD is a sex podcast that was absolutely hilarious, this is a good laugh episode if you like dirtier topics \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. The chemistry of the two host\u2019s dialogue keeps me listening. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/4K1q3l6XAMOqKGGUm4VPIt?si=MNxIJ_l3QdyjScNsYujXIw&amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A7bnjJ7Va1nM07Um4Od55dW\n\nNelk boys x Donald trump: Doesn\u2019t matter your political position, this episode is a great one regarding todays current politics in a relaxed, non news setting. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/6So8DTFq0RFf67hTGsY2cu?si=0PE9Jd-CQnq6P_Ea9xFeXQ",

He has a ton of charisma and tells a really interesting story about his work during WWII.\n\n140 - Cowboy Bob - a story about a serial bank robber that terrorized North Texas in the 90s, but never said a word or fired a shot during robberies.\n\n100&amp;101 - Ten thousand feet in the air &amp; The Fox- They interview a man inspired by D.B. Cooper and attempted to hijack a plane himself. He tells his story and what happens after.\n\n99 - Racehorse Haynes - If you've ever heard or seen Better Call Saul, this is a story about a real lawyer that sounds just like Saul Goodman in court.

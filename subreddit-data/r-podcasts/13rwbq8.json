I listen to it almost every night, and it's actually gotten to the point where I can't even listen to it during the day because it makes me too sleepy lol. Some times though the topic is too interesting, I stay awake and listen. Recently the Auto-tune episode kept me up haha. Also I feel like Stuff You Should Know does not get enough recognition. It's been around since 2008!! Thats so impressive! Also Also I just LOVE the chemistry between Chuck and Josh have. They have the BEST banter and are just genuinely sweet guys.",

Each episode the host picks something to kind of/sort of talk about: a star trek episode, made up adventures of an imaginary friend, bake off, real time cooking .... But that doesn't matter, because he goes off on tangents and never really gets to the point. Which is why it works so well (for me, anyway).",

Ok, first: restart your phone. \n\nThen you could try this: Go to the podcast list, open the one you want to delete, click the settings wheel down right and deactivate the \u201eauto-refresh feed\u201c option. The podcast should stay in your list, but no longer download new episodes. If you use playlists, you could move it into a separate one and forget about it. \n\nAnother idea is to delete it in a different way. I know two ways, you can try both: \n-\tIn the podcast list, swipe the podcast title to the left and click delete\n-\tIn the podcast list, click \u201eedit\u201c and then click the \u26d4\ufe0f symbol next to said podcast\n\nMy last idea is to export all your subscriptions via the settings, then delete the app, reinstall it and reimport the subscriptions. Maybe deleting the podcast works after that. But before you do that, better contact their support via the contact form at https://support.downcast.fm, they should be able to help.",

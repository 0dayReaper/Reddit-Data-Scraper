I am open to actual play dnd podcasts if they aren\u2019t super hard to follow and good to casually listen to. Not looking for anything gory or anything but definitely interested in any fantasy with some humor mixed in. Thanks!",

It's an actual play D&amp;D podcast by the legendary comedy family, The McElroys, best known for \"My Brother, My Brother and Me.\" The first \"season,\" called \"Balance\" is some of the best podcasting I've ever listened to. It takes a few episodes for the hosts to find their footing but if you stick it out, the payoff is amazing.",

It\u2019s been releasing for a decade now, and so there have been some hiatuses and cast changes in that time, but the core writing team has stuck with it, and they haven\u2019t lost their vision or voice. There is some violence, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly gory. It\u2019s often quite heartfelt, and also pretty funny.  (I also wanted to add\u2014 though you do have an extensive back catalogue to listen to, it\u2019s certainly manageable for a new listener)",

I'm also a big fan of Not Another D&amp;D Podcast for the same reasons. Any of Dimension 20's stuff has some solid comedic moments, too.\n\nAnd I don't really ever see a ton of people talking about it, but D&amp;D&amp;D is one of my favorites. I've been following members of it online in some form for years, but it's a group of friends and their DM playing D&amp;D while also having a little dinner party. Lots of fun if you like food and D&amp;D",

Often when listening to newer episodes, I find it surprising that I ever got into it when a lot of the views misalign with my own. \n\nListening to the MLK episode and surprised to hear them speak sympathetically about the BLM movement. It's almost a completely different podcast from later episodes. Is the general consensus that the show became more right-wing in recent years, or is it my imagination?",

What put me off was one too many 'Alex Jones was right about some things' about things Alex Jones was *not* right about, and a serious case of the 'just asking questions' about things that have been answered a hundred times before.",

I think the biggest example of this was the cork podcast festival where he began to question climate change (or it may have been the global response to climate change? His point became diluted very quickly) and there happened to be a number of environmental scientists in the audience. About three or four people were able to rebuke his point and he still wouldn't concede. It was a bit of a grating listen.",

I don't have a problem with being politicized or anything but there's a limit. Don't think these guys are quite there yet but I think you are correct that the tone definitely shifted a bit.\n\nMy question would be is it played up for the audience..?

I work in Florida for a few months a year and... Ouch. So I 100% understand where you're coming from.\n\nI guess I'm uneasy because it seems like actions don't matter anymore and you can't have diverging opinions. Once you have a label, you're done. Court of public opinion and so on. Calling (for example) a actual racist, racist is appropriate. But I've seen a lot of labels by association rather than giving the individual the chance they deserve (to be a good human or prove they're a turd, goes both ways).\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I understand what you're saying. In your shoes I'd surely think alike. To use the Nazi analogy once more, there's a part of me that wants to focus on Germans after WWII more than Germans during the 3rd Reich...",

What makes *me* uneasy is the actual, literal Christofascism that's on the rise right now in the West. \n\nI get your point, but I find that saying things like \"I don't give a shit about you and your opinions\" isn't constructive. Not sure if you meant it as a personal attack or not but that paragraph really soured the conversation, and that's kind of my point. I actually agree with you! I'm not a Christofacist as you put it - it's funny because I'm a pretty vocal atheist actually - so why just gear down to camping your opinions? Now if I had said things that painted me a rightwing crazy, sure. But I'm left trying to find what I said that triggered this.\n\nI'm not pretending to be holier than thou, I say things like that all the time. But then I wonder what's the point of conversation if that's what we revert back to...\n\nMy family lived through both WW in Germany and Slovakia. They also lived under Soviet dictatorships. My mother went through religious wars in the middle East and is a refugee. I know full well what sort of shitty things humans can do to humans. I'd go so far to say that I've lost most hope in the human race really. But I try...\n\nIf we listen to eachother we avoid a LOT of this. There will always be idiots and horrible assholes, but a lot of people are just... Scared. Things in the US are on a different level, like Russia, but I believe many people behind their guise of freedom seeking and patriotism, still see that things are falling apart in the world and that's what motivates their tribalism. I'm just trying to do my best to see the person behind the ideas.\n\nBut hey. This is just Reddit and we're all just semi anonymous nobodies on the internet, right?

Nothing has changed. I'm sure you hear that we have massive long waits for A&amp;E and we cannot get seen as well right? I was in A&amp;E a few weeks ago and I was seen in 30 minutes and X-Rayed in an hour.

Then a commenter brings up transgenderism for absolutely no reason. Then when someone points out how silly and dishonest this is, the response is, \"why are you people pushing culture wars? Quit being such a transphobe.\" Ok, but I didn't bring it up homie. If you don't like people calling you out for lying, you should quit lying.\n\nAlso your comment is disgustingly chupacabraphobic.",

No true crime or scary stuff. :(  Preferably science or arts/culture. Anything that sounds like some chemistry lecture with a monotone voice would just knock me out.",

I also listen to fall of civilizations to fall asleep to (sometimes I end up staying up later than intended because it is fascinating).\n\nI watch on Youtube because I like to fall asleep to visuals too. I also like, History of the Universe, History Time, The People Profiles, Voyage of the Continents (on Magellan TV), North 02 (archeology and human evolution), Let's Talk Religion.",

Also about evolution but just one British host of a similar class background to Fall of Civilizations. The one about the Baikal seal is probably a good self contained episode to start with. Episodes are fairly short, like 7-12 minutes. \n\n * Folding Ideas. Mainly about culture and technology. American host. Long episodes (one to two hours). \u201cLine Goes Up\u201d about crypto and NFTs is the place to start. \n\n * Shaun. About politics, slightly more lower middle class British. Very left wing. Early episodes are a lot of painstaking rebuttals of random alt right people, but more recently he\u2019s looked at more approachable topics. The two recent videos I remember the best are a long video on the Harry Potter books and another one about the decision to drop the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",

Each season tell the story of our understanding of a topic interspersed with biographies of important figures along the way. The host is a very good storyteller and provides a very clear narrative of how we came to understand an aspect of the world.  There are 2 seasons of note:\n\nSeason 2 tells the story of how we came to understand what the universe is made of.  From ancient philosophical ideas of matter to the discovery of the atom, then the discovery of subatomic particles, then to quantum mechanics and the standard model. \n\nSeason 3 tells the story of how we came to understand the landscape of the universe. It starts with ancient conception of the earth to the first estimates of the size of the earth to the identity of objects in the night sky to the location of the earth in the solar system to the discovery of other galaxies to the discovery of the expansion of the universe to the modern theories of the Big Bang and inflationary period and dark matter and energy.   It hits our understanding of gravity and mechanics along the way so there is a lot about newton and Einsteins work. \n\nWriting all this makes me want to listen to it again.",

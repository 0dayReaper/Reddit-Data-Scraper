    "postText": "The show is in its second season now. I started listening to it a few months ago after hearing about it through another Radiotopia show. If you like stories, you\u2019ll dig it. They tell their own stories of how they got to where they are, and there\u2019s a lot of interesting information about prison life. Hosted by Nigel Poor (a Sarah Koenig type who regularly chuckles at the comparison), and Earlonne Woods, a San Quentin inmate who serves as a sort of tour guide into the world of prison life.\n\nIt\u2019s not heavy duty true-crime type stuff. More of a human interest type show imo. Anyway, I\u2019ve found some great podcasts from this sub, and this is the first time I had one to toss in the mix. Hope you like it.\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ear-hustle/id1240841298?l=es&amp;mt=2",

The \u201cDirty Water\u201d episode is a must listen also. Ear Hustle generates discussion that reminds us that people in prison are in fact people, not another statistic.",

            "comment": "At first you're like \"how the hell do prison inmates make such a good podcast?\" Then you research it and it turns out Nigel Poor and Leila Day have been there at San Quentin teaching the inmates how to make podcasts for years. And there are a ton of audio programs they've made and practiced on before making Ear Hustle. They have a fully stocked media lab with Pro Tools, recording gear, the works. And they've been using it for years. This is no overnight success, this was the result of a lot of classes the prisoners took, and a lot of practice they did before making this podcast.\n\nAnd then, this podcast only came to be because it was the winner of a contest. Radiotopia held a contest that anyone can submit an idea for a podcast and you have to include like 2 minutes of audio. They got over 1000 submissions. They narrowed it down to 50 of the best ones then let the Radiotopia patreons vote for on the final 50. And Ear Hustle won so they turned it into a show. Without the backing of Radiotopia, this show might have never happened.",

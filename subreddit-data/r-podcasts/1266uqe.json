    "postText": "I don't usually get sucked into a podcast like this, but I finished it within 24 hours... holy shit, guys. Also, I only stumbled onto it because I started listening to That's Pretty Dark (I have a type, can you tell?) And they referenced that case and this podcast season and literally said \"go listen to it, it's beautifully done\" so I literally stopped listening, and dived right into it. \n\nFor those who don't know and want a TLDR, it's an investigative trip into the Jacob Wetterling case from the 80s, an 11 year old boy who was kidnapped. It took 27 years to solve, and lemme just say... what the FUCK, county sheriff's dept?!?!?! \n\nIt really blows my mind how dismissive those who worked the case were during that whole thing. I know the 80s and 90s were a totally different time when it comes to crime, but it just seems like nobody did their due diligence to try to figure out what happened to this poor boy??? Maybe my views are skewed because I grew up on Bones and Criminal Minds and shows like that where they deep dive into mysterious cases UNTIL ITS SOLVED and they're passionate about solving it (yeah, it's obv fake and all, but still!) \n\nThat poor family, those poor families, those poor boys... I can't even imagine what else happened in that town that we will literally never know about. Shits fucked up, man.",

Jacob\u2019s story also ties in with the Who Took Johnny documentary about a young boy, Johnny Gosch who went missing around the same time period.",

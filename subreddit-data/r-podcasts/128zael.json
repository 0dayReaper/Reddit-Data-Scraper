            "comment": "There are quite a few and most are within a political spectrum rather than general commentary. \n\nOh God What Now. Political commentary from Remainers. Liberal viewpoints.\n \nThe Bunker is good to from them. \n\nThe Rest is Politics - Labour and Conservative viewpoints. Alistair Campbell and Rory Stewart\n\nNovara Live. Left, Socialist, Marxist views on politicsl news\n\nFT's Political Fix (Payne's Politics)\n\nThe New Statesman podcast. \n\nThe News Agents. General news with Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall\n\nPolitics Weekly from The Guardian. Left leaning. \n\nRed Box Politics. Weekly Right leaning from The Times\n\nSophy Ridge on Sunday. Interviews of politicians from the Sky News lot. \n\nThis kind of covers all spectrums. I will admit that not all easily digestible but for a well rounded digest these are pretty good.",

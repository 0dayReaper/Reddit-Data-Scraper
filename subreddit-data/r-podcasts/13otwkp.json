    "postText": "I do a lot of crosswords and sudoku, and I'm especially a huge fan of the YouTube channel Cracking the Cryptic, which provides tons of daily content of them solving absolutely brilliant and endlessly creative puzzles.\n\nBut I can't do sudoku while I'm driving. So I was wondering if there's any audio podcast I can listen to which has me solve something, along with the host? Or listen along while the host works out the solution to a puzzle, but one that doesn't require visual input?\n\nI'm not sure if anything like that exists.",

I haven't listened and it's only 6 episodes or something but it seems to have good background about the channel in general.\n\nWhat about **Hey Riddle Riddle**? It'll be the most popular but also it's less about actually solving the riddles and more about creating a comedy situation around the riddle. \n\nThere are a ton that solve the NYT crossword (Crosspod Wordcast, Jean and Mike Do The NYT Crossword are two)\n\nNPR's Sunday Puzzle podcast are short episodes but at least you'll be able to actually solve something: anagrams etc\n\nSomething tangential might be the [More Or Less](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrss1/episodes/downloads) pod from the BBC - breaking down common stats. I like this one, especially when they mythbust stats around news topics, like the cost of the Qatar world cup. I also like that the episode is as long as it needs to be, so they vary in length.",

Then you would do well at looking at how mental conditions are treated, and what the state of mental health is in the medical community and the failure of the government when it comes to treating people with mental conditions. Why? Because it is exactly that that is not being covered whenever (or otherwise) there is a mass shooting. To add to that perhaps look into the failure of dealing with the influx of the Mexican cartels as there are shootings that involve multiple people clearly cartel related. \nGood luck finding any real investigations or headlines about this. NPR is definitely not the place. But, if you want confirmation bias, feel free. Remember, guns don\u2019t kill people - no weapons kill people, people kill people.",

The answer in my view is the same reason other problems the UK has aren\u2019t here. They are numerous and varied. Even better is if I ask you why there are no mass shootings in Liberia where guns are in almost every household relatively speaking, or perhaps in Switzerland where having a rifle is actually encouraged? \nThe U.S. is a massive country populated by states that have in themselves more people than many countries do. There are states that have problems and issues the others do not. It is more helpful to understand what a state, or county that has an incident such as a shooting is dealing with (or perhaps isn\u2019t dealing with properly) to get, if possible, a more complete picture as to what might have led to it. There are those times where answers aren\u2019t forthcoming, but there are those where a pretty clear trail in a shooters life leads to violence. Those will have in them many red flags and points where people or agencies tasked with the persons care could have and should have made a difference but didn\u2019t. If you researched any shootings in greater detail, there is no doubt you would be made aware of this, but it would appear you are as so many others prone to being reactionary instead of being proactive. \nAgain, people kill people.",

Guns are designed for killing, they make it dramatically easier to kill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw, America has 120 guns per 100 people. \n\nSwitzerland has 20 guns per 100 people...\n\nLiberia is 2.1 per 100 people...\n\nHow many more children do you think will have to do die in your country before you change your mind?

No, first you have to show you have a gun license which is to show that you know about gun safety practices and techniques. Then, you have to wait a period of 10 days in order for the Federal Government to run a background check on you - any red flags (if they have been properly noted) will stop the process at this time. Then the gun is given to you in exchange for your fingerprints.  The types of weapons one is allowed vary from state to state. So yeah we have regulations.  Isn\u2019t that what is needed?

We obviously do not agree with the others arguments about guns, types of guns and rights to own them. We do about the way in which they are not to be used, that is clear at least in one certain aspect right? They are not to be used to kill innocent people. That we 100% agree upon. Well that is encouraging wouldn\u2019t you say?\nGood, so now we at least must see who would do such a crime. Who would take the life of innocent people - in mass numbers nonetheless. That is what this whole argument stems from right? That is what is being argued about at its core. So then, Solve that problem and , simply put, everyone is satisfied. Only then can we move one to any other discussion about an object that by itself does nothing but rust. Then we can see the argument revolve around  incredible gang violence and how they use weapons, can discuss the racial aspect that is involved in gun use and how the media uses lies to promote agendas. See when it comes to that point though - as it should, many other points will be raised. Yes, this is all somehow thrown about when it come to the truth about people and weapons. But we should remain focused as it is mass shootings that lies at the crux of the discussion. I doubt the question should come up again for any other reason; when the guns are not used to harm innocent people, why should it? \nSo, since what I\u2019ve stated are valid, and as I\u2019ve shown I can remain within the reason guns have been at forefront of the news. How should we continue?\n\nOh and your part about Walmart is valid, just not in California where I live. See here we are still very restricted - but as I had stated, the United States is quite large so things vary from state to state. Here States govern individually with agreement that the Federal government really should no overreach its administration. That is an entirely different discussion though. Regardless, here in California is is no small thing to buy a gun of any type. The same exists in many other states, however in others besides, the process can vary in different ways. As it should for simple reasons of population, geography etc.  though important, that lies outside the scope of what we are really discussing - unless you feel it should be included, but  unless you know how and why it should, I certainly wouldn\u2019t use it as any base for exchange.\n\nI hope you might find common ground with any of this and I look forward to perhaps , with you solving this pressing problem that everyone want to involve themselves with.",

My favorite episodes have been Julia and Rose. I love the \"I had a fight with someone when I was younger, let's find out why\". It's like true crime but low stakes. I love it. I kinda hate actual true crime, though.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for something with a similar vibe I'd love to hear it!",

Some stories and the overarching story have a similar theme about reflecting on the past &amp; what could have been. Highly recommend the show even though the subject matter is pretty different from heavyweight. The show has pretty high production quality too.",

It's about moments in someone's life that change them and how they learn to adapt, whether it's finding out about a lost family member, a death, an illness etc.. quite a broad range of issues are covered, some can be quite dark but it always has a positive message.\n\nCriminal is true crime but a lot of the episodes are quite low-stakes and fun.\n\nI'd also recommend Mystery Show with Starlee Kine. There's only a few episodes but she and Jonathan Goldstein have a very similar way of reporting stories, same vibe. It's basically Heavyweight with a female host.",

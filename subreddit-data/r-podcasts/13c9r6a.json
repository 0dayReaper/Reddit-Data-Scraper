    "postText": "Hopefully this is a good place for this since it's kind of tangentially related, but I work in a manufacturing facility that is ITAR registered, meaning no cameras are allowed in the facility in order to prevent corporate espionage. I can't carry my phone while I work, but I still need to be able to keep up on my podcasts and pass the time, so I wonder if anyone knows of a device that is more than an mp3 player but less than a smartphone. \n\nIdeally, something android based that has access to the google play store (or similar) with wifi, Bluetooth and a touchscreen, but no camera or cellular capability.",

Hope this helps and I hope you find what you're looking for. Just nearly vomited when my Bluetooth stopped working today and realized I have to go without podcasts at work until I get a new one Wednesday lol",

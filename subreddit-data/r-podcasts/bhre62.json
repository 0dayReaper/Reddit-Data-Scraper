Like they'll say stop, say that joke again, and the performers are already trained that they just riffed/improvised something good but the punchline took a while to get to, so they just do it again and get right to the point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr they'll stutter and stumble over a name, and re-do it.  They re-do lots of names.  At the end, they even have a list from some producer of all the names and lines they need to re-do, so you sit there and watch them do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, a week later, you listen to it on the radio (or podcast) and it's about half the overall length, and crisp and clean and sharp. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think most podcasts bother with this, but it comes from being super old school WBEZ radio. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the 'Chase auditorium' sounds super fancy, but it's like literally the big auditorium/meeting room in the basement of a bank headquarters that they otherwise aren't using on the weekend, which is kind of funny.  It's perfectly fine, but I think I had college lectures in better auditoriums as far as aesthetics. But who cares, radio! Haha. It's also pretty cheap too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you ever get the chance to see it in Chicago, I highly recommend it.  I think when they tour the show out of town they go to better venues though.",

I don't mind it when certain podcasts do live episodes because there isn't a shift in style or anything, the only difference is that there are people laughing and cheering on the background sometimes. No such thing as a fish does this quite well, IMO. There are podcasts that will do live episodes where there is a complete shift in the style of the podcast and they will be changing everything because it will resonate better with the live audience, completely ignoring the podcast audience. That I don't like and, in such cases, I usually just skip the episodes. I don't think there's anything wrong with doing something different for a live show, just make sure you're not trying to pass it as one more episode like any other, because that's not what it is.",

With \"How Did This Get Made\" some of my favorite episodes are live ones because the hosts know how to work a crowd, since they have improv/comedy backgrounds, and the audio quality isn't significantly worse. Meanwhile Night Vale's live shows are always a skip because it just seems like a normal show but with more distractions. So I guess it just depends on the nature of the show and if the host(s) know how to adapt to the situation.",

It\u2019s annoying to me. Those special changes are meant for a specific group of people at a specific place at a specific point in time. Anywhere else and it simply feels odd. But that\u2019s my undergrad in music performance bleeding through. It gets pretty philosophical really quickly. That\u2019s the problem with academia; it tends to ruin things that were once fun. \n\nIf you enjoy the live performances and feel moved by them, then that\u2019s excellent. Enjoy that experience.

Andy Zaltzman and his guests are all stand-up comedians and, naturally, perform better with the crowd.\n- **Dead Pilots Society** podcast is always live, but shouldn't be. Audio quality is always mediocre (too quiet or too noisy) and presence of the live audience does not add anything to the experience of podcast listener.\n- I generally skip **Judge John Hodgman** live shows - John and Jessie become too over the top in front of live audience and it detracts from experience.\n- Some podcasts, like **RHLSTP** or **The Moth** just wouldn't work without live audience.",

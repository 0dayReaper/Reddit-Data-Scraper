    "postText": "I enjoy true crime podcasts like Dr. Death, The Dropout, Bear Brook, Bone Valley but recently I listened to mystery/crime podcasts in non-North American countries that were very intriguing. I really loved learning about how the police and law operate in a different culture and I felt I learned so many new things (especially since I haven\u2019t been able to travel in a long time). \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for podcasts in the same vein as The Evaporated: Gone with the Gods (Japan and missing people) and Death Island (Thailand and brutal murders on a popular island)? \n\nThanks in advance!",

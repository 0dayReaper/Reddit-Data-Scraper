I'm sure she had her reasons but there wasn't anything to release. Gimlet has messed up a lot of stuff but I don't think Mystery Show is totally on them.",

This came without warning while I was in the midst of working on the second season. I\u2019d been having trouble figuring out the new season \u2013 second seasons can be tricky \u2013 and so I'd gone away, to work on an episode. I didn't make as much progress as I had hoped, but the season was starting to take shape. The day I returned, [Gimlet co-founder and producer] Alex Blumberg told me the show was unsustainable. I was out. I lost my staff, my salary, my benefits, my budget and my email address. Mystery Show is the only show this has happened to at Gimlet. Just a few months prior, iTunes voted it Best Podcast of the Year.\n\n\n\n\nThat same day [Gimlet published a blog post](https://gimletmedia.com/news/the-future-of-mystery-show) saying this:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Mystery Show, the Gimlet Media podcast created and hosted by Starlee Kine, expanded the notion of what a podcast could be. Each episode, Starlee solves a mystery that has been bedeviling someone for years. But Starlee knows what any true fan of mystery knows: the solution isn\u2019t the point of the mystery, it\u2019s the journey to the solution where all the delight is to be found. Gimlet is incredibly proud of Mystery Show \u2014 it was voted the #1 podcast of 2015 by iTunes and garnered widespread critical acclaim. Without a doubt, Starlee is one of podcasting\u2019s brightest talents.\n\n\n\n&gt; Mystery Show is an ambitious production and Starlee has an uncompromising vision for the show, which is what makes it so great. However, these factors combined make Mystery Show unsustainable to produce and publish on a consistent basis, and therefore Gimlet will no longer produce new episodes of Mystery Show. We are in discussions with Starlee to reach an agreement where she may produce Mystery Show independently of Gimlet.",

Join Danelle as she travels the country to understand what drew her daughter into the hidden world of the railroads. Her guides are the rail cops, train engineers, and hobos she meets along the way, each of them with their own extraordinary tales of the beauty and brutality of the rails. A mother/daughter story unfolds across a landscape of vast open spaces and filthy backstreets, as Morton learns how railroads shaped the modern world - from creating our time zones and QR codes, to the first lobbyists and unions. The story of the rails is the story of America, and through 10 episodes, Morton reckons with our history, and her family history, as she tries what she can to bring her daughter home.",

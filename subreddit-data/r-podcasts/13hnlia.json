    "postText": "Edit: 3D audio is what I was looking for\n\nThis might be a totally wrong place to ask but I'm not sure where else to go.\n\nI remember many years back there was this audio of someone getting their hair cut and if you were listening through headphones you could hear the clippers moving around your head. You almost felt like it was real. \n\nI'm looking for something similar where the audio really makes you feel like you are there so not exactly like an audio book where someone is just reading. I want to really be immersed in it. I googled 'inmersive audio experience' but the results were something completely different. Hope someone can help. Thanks",

So I encourage you to try the [Wolverine series](https://www.wolverinepodcast.com/about-the-story/). Marvel could have easily phoned it in and just got some B grade producers to make a podcast. But they didn't, they somehow found Brendan Baker to make it. And he is a sound genius. In many scenes he used binaurual mics. This is where they took a dummy's head, and put one mic in each ear. To give you the experience as if you were there. But they pay very close attention to how rooms sound, like if someone goes from inside to outside, you can absolutely hear the difference, but Brendon then makes the audio so much more immersive on top of it with music and effects. He's clearly the master when it comes to this.\n\nYou might also get something from [Sound Matters](https://soundcloud.com/sound_matters). I did.\n\nAlso this is one of my favorite audio stories ever. Jump Blue. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b07z43ss",

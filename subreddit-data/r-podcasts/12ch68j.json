I don\u2019t know if anyone will be able to help me out but I\u2019d love to listen to this particular podcast episode from 22nd June 2021, but everywhere I look it seems unavailable. Does anyone have any advice on how to access podcasts which have potentially been archived?

Internet archive might have something if show was popular enough.\n2. Someone might have a torrent of it.\n3. Contact the author directly. They likely have a copy of it in dropbox or google drive.",

    "postText": "I grew up in Tokyo in the 90s when Aum was in its peak activity. The cult used to park a promotion van at the busy crosswalk of Shibuya and believers wearing all white danced on the roof and sang their cult song praising their guru through the megaphones. They were just weird, until they were linked with suspicion of murder(s) and then the sarin attack on one of the busiest subway lines at rush hour. It was on the news constantly, every hour, every day. And then, one day, one of their top leaders was stabbed ON camera by a stranger (who was mentally unstable). The case sort of closes with Asahara\u2019s arrest, but the cult still exists under a different name, now run by his disciple - one of his daughters. \n\n\nIt has left a lasting impression on me and I\u2019d love to find a podcast that dives deep into what happened from a western investigative perspective. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know about Aum, here\u2019s what\u2019s on wiki: \n\n\u201cAleph (Japanese: \u30a2\u30ec\u30d5, Hepburn: Arefu), formerly Aum Shinrikyo (\u30aa\u30a6\u30e0\u771f\u7406\u6559, Oumu Shinriky\u014d, literally 'Supreme Truth'), is a Japanese new religious movement and doomsday cult founded by Shoko Asahara in 1987. It carried out the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for the Matsumoto sarin attack the previous year.\u201d\n\nThey were involved in abduction and murder of a lawyer who was investigating the cult, as well as murder of his family. \n\nThey killed multiple people within their org as well, directed by Asahara (founder). \n\nThey are an internationally recognized terrorist cult and while their activity has been quiet, still under surveillance. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t found any episodes on them and would love your help in my search. \nReally hope one of the true crime pods will find this post and get curious!!\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone! I will check these podcast episodes out.",

Word of warning, they cover cults, serial killers, aliens, etc. with a comedic bent, so they may not be for everyone.  That's my top pick. If you go to **Stitcher.com** and type in Aum Shinrikyo in the search box, you'll find a lot of shows did at least one episode on the cult.",

I think they did a good job capturing how ridiculous the cult could be, which kind of underlines how they were seemingly a joke, but secretly horribly deadly until it sadly wasn't so secret anymore.",

The developments were just crazy - the cult was on the radar of some journalists and I remember reading about the lawyer family and the connection with Aum. It just escalated so quickly after the subway attack. Aum\u2019s top leaders gave frequent press conferences and the media ran it on repeat with experts weighing in, discussing \u201cnew\u201d information, showing maps\u2026 honesty it was like a reality crime show. \n\nI\u2019m learning so much about them through the podcasts suggested here - it\u2019s more mind blowing than I ever thought.",

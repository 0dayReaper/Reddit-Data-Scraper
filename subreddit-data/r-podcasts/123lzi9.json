I would assume if you want to manually do it spotify and pandora could have the same options. But I haven't used either in like 6 or 7 years and what I hear from friends that do is they still have a lot of issues when it comes to managing podcast.\n\nOther than that most things I have seen don't really do the automatically updating and adding while also being to share it. You seem to either get an automatic playlist for yourself only or one you can share but have to create and add to yourself.\n\nI don't know enough to do it myself but with podchaser's api there may be a chance someone could make something like you are talking about. Then as another user said you could make an rss feed. But otherwise I couldn't find anything that already exist or would be user friendly for someone to set up with out background knowledge.",

It's really Super because I swear I searched high and low for some African-centric history and they were either done and finished a few years ago or just one minor episode within a larger world History context so I'm quite delight that he's really focusing on Africa itself.

I wish this were more focused on one region in Africa though (particularly sub-Saharan Africa, which is more underrepresented), the continent is so huge and sprawling I feel like there won't be sufficient focus to get a cohesive narrative here. Though it looks like this is still early days in the podcast so it's early to say.\n\nedit: Ah, looks like on their website it's broken into seasons with more focused themes (S1: Early Egypt, S2: Early Ethiopia)",

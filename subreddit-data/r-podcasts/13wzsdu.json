    "postText": "i really enjoy true crime podcasts that focus on specific stories but i don\u2019t feel like something particularly emotionally distressing right now so does anyone have recommendations? something similar to scamfluencers where it\u2019s more lighthearted but less banter/judgmental than morbid and still kinda upbeat unlike swindled. I do prefer some banter though because it makes it less heavy and white collar crimes/scams&gt;murder",

It's narrated by Phoebe Judge who has a voice of butter.\n\nRidiculous crime is fun in small doses.  The two hosts take turns where one will recount a \"ridiculous crime\" and the other reacts to it.  They tend to focus on heists where the perpetrators display terrible judgement or have unconventional solutions to their criminal endeavors.",

No murder. \n\nI prefer it to Scamfluencrers, whose scripting sounded forced and fake most of the time. Laci isn't informed of the story by her products ahead of time, so it feels more real.",

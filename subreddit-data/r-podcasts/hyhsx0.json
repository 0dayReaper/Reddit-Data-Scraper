It's such a simple concept and something were all familiar with, remembering a song but not knowing the name and then looking up random lyrics until they find it. But what if you can't find it with a couple of simple Google searches? The guys at Reply All go to every length to find the song and without spoiling I'll say this show has one of the most satisfying conclusions to a mystery as I can think of. Wondering if anyone else has heard this episode and felt the same way. And whole I'm here, any recommendations of similar episodes?",

I've never been so invested in a story.\n\nLong Distance, The Snapchat Thief, INVCEL, The Crime Machine, and Shine On You Crazy Goldman are also my favorite Reply All episodes! Have you listened to them?\n\nAlso have you listened to Revisionist History? The stories and research Malcolm Gladwell shares are also crazy amazing, and make you feel like your world has opened so much wider after listening. (There's so many incredible episodes but My Little Hundred Million was the first one I heard and was a great start to get sucked in)",

Sorry, I misread. \n***SPOILERS AHEAD***\n\n\n&gt;!So in the end they found a post from the Philippines that had the song lyrics and the name of the artist. They were able to contact the artist that wrote the song. He\u2019s a musician in North Carolina. Basically he wrote the song, and was giving it out to people trying to get it out into the world. He ends up being contacted by a huge record label, and they give him a record deal, but he doesn\u2019t get to re-record the song professionally, they just play his version on the radio. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t do as well as they anticipated and the record never came to fruition, which is why it\u2019s so hard to find online or otherwise.!&lt;",

But the narrative was basically just: &gt;!Ask a bunch of high up industry people who don't know the answer, then ask the Barenaked Ladies guy, who set out the correct answer in great detail, but didn't know the actual song itself, then find the song by basic research diligence without using any of the episode at all to do so. They basically googled the lyrics, except on Facebook instead of Google. !&lt;\n\nIt's a shaggy dog story, just a very entertainingly told one.

It is honestly just wonderful from start to finish - funny, dramatic, great interviews, lots of theories, and an incredibly satisfying ending (even if mildly underwhelming). It's nothing special from a concept or presentation or production perspective, but as far as great stories... can't be beat.\n\nThere are a handful of This American Life episodes that are up there and some wonderful serial type podcasts that have an overall arc that is better, but as a single episode, Case of the Missing Hit is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest.",

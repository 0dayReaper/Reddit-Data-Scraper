The two hosts are transparent about their successes and failures.\n\nCalm and Connected \nis also a helpful, practical one. The host is a counsellor who focuses on coping skills.\n\nJust One Thing with Michael Mosley\nis a short self-help podcast from the BBC.\n\nThe Lazy Genius Podcast \nis all about a handful of self-help/organizing principles that the host has been using.\n\nStruggle Care\nis about gentle ways to care for yourself and your responsibilities. I think it has an interview format.",

Something that sucks a regular person into an unreal world.",

And is in both app stores as well.\n\nAll you need is a library card at that library, and, a lot of times these days because of the pandemic libraries are even trying to make cards that one never has to come into the library to verify (as long as you're only ever using the library's online resources).\n\nOf course, this is all a moot point if you don't have access to a local library, but, it's a place to start.",

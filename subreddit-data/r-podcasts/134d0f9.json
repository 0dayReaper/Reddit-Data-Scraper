And, yeah, just did a search, and it seems to be in the iTunes Database as well?\n\nMaybe searching in the AUS region would reveal it? (Since, I think that The Australian was the one who produced it?)\n\nAs an aside, New Zealand makes some totally amazing podcasts, boggles my mind that more of them don't go viral Worldwide. People are sleeping on NZ podcasts!",

A variety of formats, tones and topics; all African-American. \n\nIn mid-2020, The Nod morphed into a daily video show on Quibi (RIP), with 7-8 minute episodes. They continued to podcast the audio of the Quibi videos. I didn\u2019t enjoy those; they were too rushed and lacked the unfolding of the stories that older versions had. \n\nTyping this is inspiring me to go re-listen to the full length episodes. I hope this helps in your fight to be your true self within Corporate America\u2019s culture. Stay strong!",

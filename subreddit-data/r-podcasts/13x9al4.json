    "postText": "Hello all! If you\u2019re not down with astrology please move along from this post. For those of us that are, I have been LOVING parcast\u2019s daily Astrology Today especially as something to wake up to for the past couple years. It has been the one thing that helps me gently wake up and actually want to get up. I love that she would say good morning and there would be chill music playing and it would last a minute or so getting my mind stimulated and thinking about the day ahead rather than how just a couple more minutes of sleep would be glorious. It didn\u2019t hurt that the astrology always surprised me with being spot on for the day, as well. Anyone finding any decent replacements? Even if it was something to just help ease me in to my day that\u2019s inspirational or motivating would be fine. I\u2019ve searched and searched and can\u2019t find anything that is daily and isn\u2019t loud, obnoxious, intense, starting right off with commercials, or too long for a quick wake-me-up. It truly was a golden nugget of a daily podcast.",

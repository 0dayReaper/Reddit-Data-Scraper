    "postText": "Hello fellow podcast-lovers,  \n\n\nToday I had a look at the statistics which my podcatcher is providing me (AntennaPod). I know I listen to a lot of podcasts, but the number I saw surprised me anyway. In 2023, so far I have [listend to 1092 hours of podcast](https://i.ibb.co/xM102tC/Screenshot-20230406-165910.png), which is almost 12 hours a day.  \nI am ill and do not work since the beginning of this year and use podcast to fall asleep to (with sleep timer) - but still, this is obivously a lot. Maybe it's too much. \n\nI honestly think, that I might have developed a unhealthy usage of podcasts. I am struggling with some mental issues for some time and I am in treatment for them since the beginning of this year. I use podcasts to distract myself, but maybe this has crossed a line into a kind of destructive coping-mechanism. Maybe it's even some kind of addiction.  \n\n\nHas anybody else here had the thought that they might **listen to too much podcasts**?",

At home, I cut back when I'm taking a walk and sometimes when I'm doing chores. \n\nFor me the big difference was coming up with something to think about deliberately. For example I'll go over life plans or my to do list that day or just whatever strikes my fancy. \n\nYou can get that listening to podcasts too, but in my experience getting spoon fed ideas like that is less beneficial. I'd start with listening to an episode and then stopping for an hour or so to think about that episode. Switch from consuming content to digesting and synthesizing.\n\n It's definitely a habit, and can be unhealthy of taken too far. Takes discipline to get habits in check but you can do it",

The key is whether you think it's negatively affecting your life - what about it do you think is self-destructive? As an experiment you could try swapping podcasts for some instrumental music (to keep some limited form of stimulation) and see if the freedom to hear your own thoughts is a positive or negative thing, and take things from there.",

I a lot of the time, I will get it where all I want to listen is to one certain podcast. My may be my autism taking form. As other have pointed out if you feel it has a negative affect your life, then there may be a problem. I say may because it might not be the podcast at fault but a symptom of a different problem.",

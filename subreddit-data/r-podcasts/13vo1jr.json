I had no idea this had happened so hearing about it was a total eye opener, and it felt like most of the people who were taken hostage were such characters! Especially the guy who went back to visit his former captor/host and the Texan family who essentially took over the running of the embassy when everyone fled. I think they made a compelling case for the coverup, too.",

They let you know in advance what movie they'll be discussing so you can watch it by the time the ep goes up. Or just listen having no idea what the movie is about which is what I do.\n\nHosted by Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael and Jason Mantzoukas.",

I listen to podcasts all day at work and Threedom has currently been on non-stop for the last couple weeks.\n\nEdit: I guess I should explain what it is. It stars Paul F. Thompkins, Lauren Lapkus, and Scott Aukerman. They're comedians, masters at improv, and friends. So it's a mix of all of their funny life stories, into random topics, and then at the end of the episode they play an improv game. They are CONSTANTLY inserting jokes.",

The reporter looks into their deaths and the failed investigation. You do learn what happens to them and the missed opportunities to follow the evidence and get a conviction.  \n[Power: The Maxwells](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/power-the-maxwells/id1633676250) About the crumbling of newspaper baron's empire and his death. (Learn how Robert Maxwell would pee off the side of his helipad onto his employees below.)\n\n[Svetlana, Svetlana](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/svetlana-svetlana/id1667321786) is the crazy story of Stalin's daughter who defected to the US told by the playwright who tried to tell her story on stage and turned to podcast to share her story. It's got KGB and Frank Lloyd Wright in there too. \n\nAs someone said below, The Secret History of Flight 149.  Season 2 T[he Secret History of the Estonia](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-secret-history-of-the-estonia/id1606899704) about the sinking of a passenger ferry in the Baltic Sea may not as gobsmakingly \"what happened and how did I not know???\" but it's also interesting.\n\n[I'm Not a Monster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/ggkz0ug4ff/im-not-a-monster). How did an American woman pick up her life and move to Syria to join Isis -- was she tricked or did she join willingly?",

She calls upon people to reflect on their behavior but not herself (she has said very problematic things about eating disorders).\n\nThis is one of the few podcast cultures that actually impacts my real life. This pod breeds a particularly evangelical I guess? kind of activist. But of course that happens when information is incomplete.\n\nI totally agree there isn\u2019t one way to do anything but they\u2019re starting to get high on their own supply. I tapped out when Aubrey was cackling about taking the stairs. No, you don\u2019t have a weight problem because you didn\u2019t take the stairs, but there is nothing wrong with taking the stairs.\n\nHypervigilence in an obesogenic environment is not disordered thinking. The problem is with society not me, the enemy is the standard American diet. We\u2019re all in this together, it just manifests in different ways. One thing I like about the higher level biohackers is they\u2019re careful to make the enemy a dynamic, not people. \n\nThis movement is, IMO, trying to normalize that it\u2019s okay to eat a lot of the things you see (obviously nutrition be damned because their leader knows nothing) and it\u2019s fats vs. thins. It\u2019s regressive while pretending it\u2019s not. Don\u2019t eat all the food, it\u2019s not about your weight, it\u2019s about it\u2019s designed to kill you. Yes, it\u2019s not my place to worry about other people\u2019s health, and I\u2019m careful about that. But you will never convince me normalizing America\u2019s food culture is a good idea.",

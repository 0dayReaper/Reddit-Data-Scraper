    "postText": "The show has been out since December and started off as a show where 3 of the stars (Charlie, Glenn and Rob) sit down and talk about each episode of the show. Seemed like FX forced content as an accompaniment to the tv show.\n\nHowever, overtime, the show has been morphing into something really special. It\u2019s unapologetically always sunny in podcast form. The hosts talk about their real lives but with the cadence of the show itself. A lot of times they barely touch on the show and talk about getting into fights, finding dead bodies while filming, crazy actors they\u2019ve worked with and industry stuff that\u2019s super interesting.\n\nBest of all, they seem to really like each other. After 15 years, their chemistry is on point. It\u2019s undeniable how much everyone loves Charlie and after the last episode, where they added a video element, You can see why. That dude brightens up a room. Shout out to Meghan, tech ops, who brings the outside laughter. \n\nI\u2019m not a diehard always sunny fan but I look forward to every episode. Genuinely funny. Check it out",

    "postText": "As much as I like Hardcore History, one of my main complaints is that his episodes are simply way too long. I get that a lot of people actually like this about him, and I can understand why. But for me personally, it's not my thing. I feel like he takes way longer than he needs to to get to the point of his topic and is basically just preaching. But when he gets to the meat of the topic, it's great. \n\nI'm just wondering what other podcasts I might like that aren't as long form but are still great to listen to.",

He also covered the New Testament and is on some early Christianity texts now.\n\nHe is very entertaining and the storytelling and production values are top notch.

It's fairly specific but does venture into the civilisations before and after and often refers things to the present day.\nI've rediscovered a love for the period through the podcast. It has a good mix of subject matter experts as guests, the host has a great way of questioning experts while inviting the listener along for the ride, and I get the impression the guests love taking part.\nThe host is also breaking down Plato's 'The Republic', book by book, in a way that encourages you to think more about what Plato was trying to say.\nCan't recommend it enough. It's the most engaging podcast I've listened to.",

I stopped listening a few years ago when the host started asking different kinds of questions to the guest author and trying to make the podcast geared toward a general audience. I preferred when it was for academics because I\u2019m an 18th century historian and wanted to learn more specialized things but she really does a wonderful job for a general \u201chistory buff\u201d audience and the production value is top notch.",

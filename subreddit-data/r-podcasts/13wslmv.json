    "postText": "Hi all, 26f and I find myself listening almost exclusively to podcasts led by men. I\u2019d love to add some women\u2019s voices, especially queer women, into the mix. \n\nMy current faves are Las Culturistas, Stuff You Should Know, The Dollop, Lovett or Leave it, Sinisterhood, Hysteria, and Maintenance Phase (realizing this is an odd list) \n\nAnything you love that are updated weekly, conversational, generally lighter, and feels topical? Although I love pop culture, I\u2019m not looking for anything that\u2019s specifically a recap pod.",

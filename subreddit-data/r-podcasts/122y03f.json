    "postText": "I recently made the switch to Google Podcasts because I like to play podcasts through my browser and phone on an alternating basis throughout the day. I was paying for PocketCasts but decided it wasn't worth it compared to the free Google Podcasts.\n\nNow I have added my 400 something podcasts, I am regretting it somewhat. In particular, I hate that when I queue a podcast, it goes to the bottom of the list rather than the top. \n\nIs there any way to fix this, or any hacks to get around it? Or is there a way I can RSS my Google Podcasts subscriptions through another free app? \n\nAny advice much appreciated.",

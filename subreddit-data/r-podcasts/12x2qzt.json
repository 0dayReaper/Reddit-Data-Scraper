    "postText": "I\u2019ve been listening to true crime podcasts for years now but lately have been noticing the amount of misogyny and other ignorance a lot of hosts have when it comes to covering stories involving women criminals or cases. I also appreciate really good research! So, I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any recommendations of true crime podcasts that are respectful but maybe even use a feminist or intersectional lens to approach their stories/research! I really have been liking Serial &amp; The Coldest Case in Laramie, and I also really like Bad Gays and the way they approach the genre during their Aileen Wurnous and Jeffrey Dahmer episodes, just to give examples of some stuff I have stuck with! I really appreciate any help, recs, and comments! :)",

    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI've never been big into podcasts. The only one that not only had be interested but straight up made me lose sleep over it, was Who killed daphne. For those of you who don't know about it, it's essentially a band of journalists who get together to investigate the politically motivated murder of their coworker. I'm not really interested in the murder part (hence my not flairing this as 'true crime') but rather in the investigative side of it. Journalists going through archives, interviewing people and uncovering conspiracies. I guess if I had to draw some movie parallels, Zodiac and Spotlight would come to mind. The investigation , rather than the subject , is my main focus but bonus points if it involves politics.\n\nThank you in advance.",

But here are some investigative podcasts that I have enjoyed -\n\n* [The Assassination](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05r6cgx) is an investigation into the death of Pakistan's ex-PM Benzair Bhutto\n\n* [Pig Iron](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/listen/pig-iron/) is an investigation into the death of a war reporter in South Sudan \n\n* [Hunting Warhead](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/hunting-warhead-child-porn-investigation/) - investigating a child pornography ring (word of warning, a lot of people in this subreddit say they couldn't handle the heaviness of the subject matter, so proceed with caution)\n\n* [Intrigue](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04sj2pt/episodes/downloads) - each season investigates a different topic, some are more interesting than others. Tunnel 29 is my favourite season.\n\n* [The Last Voyage of the Pong Su](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-last-voyage-of-the-pong-su/id1481166968) - North Korean intrigue in Australia",

There is a different investigative story each episode and the journalist takes you through how they investigated it.   \nYou might also like **Bed Of Lies** S1 and S2 from The Telegraph. Each season deals with a different theme. The first was about undercover cops and what happens to the people they've lied to for years when they stop being undercover. Second season is about one of the biggest medical coverups in recent history. \n\n[Day X](https://www.nytimes.com/column/day-x) is also great. \n\n&gt;This story began with a mysterious gun in an airport bathroom and led to a German military officer facing trial on terrorism charges. It\u2019s a story about national identity and reckoning, mirroring the story of Germany itself. And years later, it\u2019s still unfolding \u2014 raising a question that democracies across the world are waking up to: What happens when the threat is coming from within?",

But I love investigative podcasts that tell an interesting/compelling story in detail, with interviews/evidence gathering etc. Here are some of my favourites (that aren\u2019t \u201ctrue crime\u201d:\n- [The Missing Crypto-queen](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-missing-cryptoqueen/id1480370173) - a deep dive into One Coin, a Cryptocurrency that was essentially a scam. The founder made millions and then disappeared &amp; the podcast documents the rise of One Coin &amp; the search for her. \n- [Hoaxed](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/hoaxed/id1642760632) - follows the story of 2 children who walked into a police station in a London suburb claiming to have been abused by their father and other members of their community. Their mother then shared a list of people within the community, claiming each was a part of a ring of satanic abusers. The podcast charts the spread of misinformation and how the accusations sparked a mini Satanic Panic\n- [You\u2019re Wrong About](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439) - I haven\u2019t listened in a while, but two journalists basically take a topic and deep dive into it, with a focus on facts vs how a story evolved. Their OJ Simpson deep dive is particularly great.\n- [A Very British Cult](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m001kvf8?partner=uk.co.bbc&amp;origin=share-mobile): on BBC Sounds. Focuses on a life coaching company that slowly indoctrinated its members, creating a cult-like following focused on the Company\u2019s founder.",

Other episodes might also interest - more sciencey than crime tho. More Perfect discusses the US supreme court and laws etc.\nThe teacher's pet (don't Google) involves investigating a missing person in Australia.\nWhere's George Gibney- investigation of an abusive swim coach.\nThe Jinx- a series, not a podcast,  may be available online might be of interest. \nI'm going to presume that you have heard of Serial (don't Google that one either), investigation into the evidence behind a murder case.",

There are episodes I skip, like long-form interviews or specific pop culture that I've literally never heard of. But some excellent investigative ones about agriculture workers, border crossings, water access, and some that are primarily a fun/heartwarming topic but explores the history with side issues like bodegas, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, LA's backyard parties, etc.",

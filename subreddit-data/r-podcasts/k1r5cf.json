Now, he had a relatively deep voice so I thought he was an older guy and something about the quality of his voice made me think he would look like Leonard Maltin. I was way off. This happens to me all the time, I don't know why I'm so bad at guessing that.",

Sometimes it's just the intonation, but it's also quite common for both men and women to pitch their voices lower when performing. Derek Hayes (of Monsters Among Us) is an example - on the podcast, he has a very deep, slightly raspy voice, occasionally venturing into fry territory. Then I hear him on a discussion panel episode where he was using his normal speaking voice, and he sounded so different that I at first didn't realize it was him.\n\nEdit: Also, he looks nothing like what I envisaged.",

There's a podcast called [OSW Review](http://oswreview.com/episodes/), where three hilarious Irish lads chronologically critique professional wrestling PPVs.  The first time I saw a picture of those guys, it completely changed the image I had in my head for the disembodies voices I was listening to.",

He's way more punk, tattooed, pierced and sloppy in my mind than the clean-cut, fair, together guy in the photo on the website! Same with his announcer. She's like a crazy weird Moon Unit Zappa in my mind, not the preppy mild-mannered woman in the photo \ud83d\ude02",

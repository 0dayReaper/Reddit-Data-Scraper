    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for the Bill Kurtis of the podcast world. Lindsey Graham is the best I\u2019ve found so far. Help me out, I need something to fall asleep to! \n\nFav podcasts include American Scandal, American History Tellers, American Greed, any number of the Wondery true crime releases - Dr Death etc. \n\nBig fan of single narrator podcasts with minimal interviews. The dual host with banter is off the table for bedtime. I\u2019m save Scamfluencers for driving lol\n\nEDIT: thanks for everyone\u2019s suggestions!! Will check them all out.",

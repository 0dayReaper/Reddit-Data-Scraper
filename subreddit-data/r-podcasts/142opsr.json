    "postText": "The recent Gimlet layoffs have got me thinking. I love the original Start Up podcast, Mystery Show, and Reply All. Now that Gimlet Media is just about done and Spotify has made it clear they want all their podcasts to be Spotify-exclusive\u2026 am I replying on someone (Spotify?) to keep paying the bills to make them available on my favorite podcast app? And if Spotify goes out of business or pivots, will the shows just going to be gone forever?\n\nI guess a related question: what\u2019s the easiest way to save these files for later? I thought theoretically a podcast is just an RSS feed, but is that true? Is there somewhere I can go to find the raw files for every podcast\u2019s episodes or does it vary between each platform they\u2019re uploaded to?",

The only way around this is to save them locally as mp3 files.  You have to go to each show's website or to the platform website and download it from that. \n\nI would do this for any podcast that you really like from the BBC.  They tend to remove a lot of podcasts for some reason.",

Parsing this feed is how your favourite podcast app knows where to find an episode of Mystery Show. \n\nIf the server hosting the raw media files go dark, *or* the server hosting the RSS feed goes dark, the podcast disappears from the internet. For really popular ones, you might find episodes archived by someone - but the only way to be sure your favourites are preserved is to do it yourself.\n\nThe easiest way to download all episodes is via a podcatcher. The one I use (Podcast Republic) has a \"Download All\" button that'll download the raw media files for all episodes onto my phone - and then I can put them on whatever archival storage I want.",

That could be the creator of the show, but it may be that there's an agreement in place that means the copyright is held by the producer, or by a production company, or by the distributor.\n\nUnless it has been made explicitly clear that rehosting the files is fine, you should not assume that free = no protection.",

That way they can track downloads - which impact ad revenue - and advertise their donation options. Taking their work and hosting on your site means diverting traffic from *their* site. It might not divert a lot of people, but it's still unethical. \n\nOnce a podcast is dead though, it may be okay to do so. Not in all cases - if the creator specifically removed the podcast for some reason, it's a bit of a jerk move to bring them back online. I'm thinking of a trans YouTuber who removed all her older content, from when she presented as male, because she was uncomfortable with those being the first images anyone finds on googling her/her channel. It would be pretty crummy for somebody who has downloaded those videos to put them up for public consumption again. But if the podcaster simply stopped paying for hosting, it is ethically ok to resurrect it in my book. However, it would be best to contact them and get permission even in that case.",

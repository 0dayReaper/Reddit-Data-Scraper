And Toastmasters provides a safe place to speak.\n\n(Can you imagine learning to play piano by listening to a podcast about playing piano?)",

We had one gal hide in the bushes outside the building for a couple of meetings before someone saw her and brought her in. A year later, she had a big promotion and was president of the club. The one piece of advice I'd give you is that you should visit several clubs before choosing one. Every club will use the same program, but clubs have different vibes. You want to find one with people you like and can trust.",

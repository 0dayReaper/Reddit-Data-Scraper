If I click an episode that promises an interview with a famous stage magician, don't ramble on for ten to fifteen minutes about shit I don't care about. Brief intro, then get to the point.  \n  \nIf your main content isn't starting within the first 4 minutes I will probably not continue listening to your episodes.",

If podcasters try to change from their instincts or interests to try to please everyone, they will ruin their show and please no one, IMO",

Comedy shows often have a very loose agenda or no agenda at all. So they take their sweet time getting to their one thing they came to say. Take My Favorite Murder for example. 45 minutes of fluff before getting to the case. And people love that 45 minutes of fluff. Or look at Misfits or Cum Town who have absolutely no idea what they turned on the mics to talk about and just make it up as they go. These 3 shows are inspiring thousands of podcasters to try the same thing.\n\nBut if you're doing any kind of educational show like actually teaching me something, to waste my time up top is a sin.",

I prefer podcasts with a duo or a team which give that conversation feel, to podcasts that are a single person which have more of a reading me a story feel. \n\nPersonally I feel like the ones that have a bit of banter and chit chat have some personality, which I really like although it can be taken to the extreme. I don't like **My Favourite Murderer** because the chit chat is too long and I don't feel the cases are well reserched and it's taken me a year of trying to get used to **The Last Podcast On The Left** because I felt it was a bit disorganised. Two that I love the personality and banter on is **Sinisterhood** and **Red Handed**. The hosts in both of those podcasts have such good chemistry that I'd love to hear them discuss what grocery shopping they buy, but they do get to the story/case and its always really good and well researched.\nOne that I love that does get right to the content but still has the conversation feel is **Small Town Dicks**. They don't really banter but again the story attracts me and the chemistry is what keeps me returning.\n\nI guess for me it's personality and chemesty on top of well researched content that I enjoy. It's never the banter or whatever on its own that puts me off. Different strokes for different folks.",

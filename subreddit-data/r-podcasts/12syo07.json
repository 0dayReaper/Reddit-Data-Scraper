    "postText": "I\u2019ve been really enjoying LPN deep dives lately, both the past Dune deep dive and currently ACOTAR. Any other podcasts that are similar? I love that they basically go through the entire plot of the book while adding colorful commentary.\n\nI only really enjoy science fiction &amp; fantasy books so a podcast about those genres would be great, even if the hosts don\u2019t go through the entire book. Even better if there\u2019s a podcast about mainstream YA fantasy books (that are slightly bad), because I would like to listen to someone talk about it rather than read it lol.",

They're a little unstructured sometimes but they genuinely love/hate all of it so it's pretty fun. \n\nDerry Public Radio is a Stephen King book club podcast.  They go pretty in depth and have covered a lot of books so far.  I used it kind of as a companion when I read Needful Things and they clearly stated how far they were reading before the next episode. Idk if you read any king but he has some more sci-fi/fantasy stuff, instead of straight horror.",

Dune had male hosts from their main show and ACOTAR has female hosts that are the wife and sister of the male hosts (respectively!). I actually love the energy of the female hosts more cause one keeps structure and the other all chaotic sex jokes.",

It started with the whole Dark Tower series for season 1 and have continued through more King books, from those most closely tied to the series on out. I love it.\n\nI'm psyched about the Pynchon podcast listed here.",

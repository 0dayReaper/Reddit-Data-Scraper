    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ve recently really loved the Huberman Labs podcast because he takes a science evidence based approach. However, I find myself wanting to listen to someone who focuses more on women\u2019s health specifically because I do think it differs. Anyone have suggestions? Nothing too holistic or claiming to be \u201cnatural\u201d",

Awesome science topics in general.",

I like things with a focus on exercise science so not sure these will work for you but I\u2019ll share just in case. \n\nWhile I haven\u2019t listened to a lot of episodes some cursory digging led me to:\n\nFuel your strength - focused discussions on lifting and how to optimize nutrition and how you strength train in and out of the gym.\n\nThe messy middle - two phd candidates and they discuss existing in the \u201cmessy middle\u201d of women\u2019s health, fitness and nutrition. Looking at a lot of the extremes that are marketed to women (ie. Fad diets, fad exercises etc.). I have only listened to to a couple of the early episodes but some good info.\n\nMuscle science for women -  \u201cthis podcast  dives into all aspects of fitness including nutrition, training, recovery, fitness culture, and so much more, all with a focus on addressing women's unique goals and challenges. It's conversational, interactive, and will help listeners understand their bodies and how to achieve their goals.\u201d From the podcast blurb. This one was recommended to me but I haven\u2019t had a listen yet. \n\nI also follow a couple running pods, trail running women and the running podcast explained, which are women focused. Might not be what you\u2019re looking for but thought I would share in case you\u2019re interested. \n\nIf you find something else please edit your post because I would be interested!",

Additionally, Episodes 29-30 discuss medical bias. All sources are included in the episode notes. It's called [The Bar is Ankle High](https://www.thebarisanklehigh.com/listen)",

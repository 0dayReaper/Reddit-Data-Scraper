    "postText": "Here's a list of podcasts discussing the WGA strike. I'd also be interested in any new podcasts by guild members, like a comedy podcast by late night writers.\n\n- **[Strike Talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deadline-strike-talk-with-billy-ray-and-todd-garner/id1686019933)** from Deadline Hollywood\n- **[Scriptnotes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scriptnotes-podcast/id462495496)**\n- **[The Town](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-town-with-matthew-belloni/id1612131897)** from Puck and The Ringer\n- **[TV's Top Five](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tvs-top-5/id1438063915)** from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nAny others? One particular episode I'd recommend is The Town's **[interview with Adam Conover](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-the-writers-strike-with-a-wga-negotiator/id1612131897?i=1000611506663)**, who's the former host of Adam Ruins Everything, and is a negotiator for the WGA.\n\nThe TV's Top Five podcast normally interviews showrunners, but since they're not allowed to promote their projects during the strike, they're interviewing striking writers on the picket lines instead.",

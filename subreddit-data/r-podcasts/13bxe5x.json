I can't think of any podcast I have listened to that overused fillers - though it's not my pet peeve, so maybe I just don't notice them!?\n\nI listen to mostly scripted podcasts though, so naturally they're much more polished than a \"bunch of guys talking around a table\" stuff. The very few unscripted podcasts I listen to are hosted and/or edited by tv/radio professionals - maybe that helps too.",

Do you have any favorites? \n\nI think it\u2019s a thing people don\u2019t notice unless it bothers them, and I might have annoyed people just by mentioning it. To be clear, it doesn\u2019t even bother me if it\u2019s occasional. It\u2019s when it\u2019s every single sentence that I get frustrated. And there are definitely broadcast professionals who have this specific verbal tic. Guy Raz is a good example. I like his voice and the pods he hosts but get frustrated by this one thing. I know it\u2019s common speech and that the problem is \u201cme,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t change it bothering me. \ud83d\ude06\n\nA few I like are Judge John Hodgman, That Aged Well (they do it sometimes but not constantly), Twenty Thousand Hertz, and Articles of Interest. The more scripted, the better, because many hosts don\u2019t do it at all when covering their material but do it constantly when interviewing off the cuff.",

                            "comment": "&gt; Scripted podcasts are definitely better! Do you have any favorites? \n\nMike Duncan (of [History of Rome](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) and [Revolutions](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) fame) is probably my favourite independent host. He keeps his script tight and well edited and my impression is he doesn't waste words!\n\nAs a network, I'm really fond of BBC and RT\u00c9 - even their interview podcasts like [Desert Island Disc](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr) and [Second Captains](https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/second-captains/) are tightly edited. I like too many of their scripted podcasts, but The Lazarus Heist, Season 1, I'm Not A Monster, both seasons, The Assassination and Doc-on-One are probably my standout favorites. Other public broadcasters (RNZ, ABC and CBC) are also great sources for professionally presented and tightly edited podcasts + as an added bonus they rarely have ads!\n\nThe unscripted podcasts I like include Infinite Monkey Cage, That Peter Crouch Podcast, Guardian Football Weekly, My Dad Wrote A Porno and You're Dead to Me. *I* feel they're fairly tightly edited and there's very little filler words/fluff in general (though there are plenty of *tangents*). But again, not my pet peeve, so maybe I'm just not noticing it! \n\nIf you give any of these a shot, let me know if they do have filler words! I'm curious now!",

Pretty sure Jack Rhysider of Darknet Diaries is conscientious of this \u2014 although interviewees might be annoying. \n\nIIRC Rabbit Hole (NYT) and WashPo Investigates Canary didn\u2019t have this problem.

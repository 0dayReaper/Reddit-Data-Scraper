    "postText": "Trying to remember a horror serial podcast I used to listen to in 2019-2020. Are any of you familiar with a horror audio drama podcast where each episode was maybe 20-30 minutes in the form of short horror stories and had a host almost like the crypt keeper who opened each episode. \nSome episodes I remember are one where bed bugs are the big horror at this mattress store. \nAnother was two brothers at the beach with a mysterious missing dad who see a guy digging on the beach and find the hole to be  continuous and one brother is buried in the sand by the end. \nThe art for each ep is also almost like old school pulp/ serial horror too.",

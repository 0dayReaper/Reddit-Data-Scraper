I'm going for finite series with good-great sound design. Little murder. Will Throw a few best episodes in.\n\n**30 for 30** \\- Even if you're not that into sports, so many good seasons. Sterling Affairs is a dark horse podcast, so good. The Karolis, Bikram, several individual episodes are great too.  \n\n\n**A Very British Cult** \\- sooooo good, scam disguised as life coaching  \n\n\n**Bad Blood: The Story of Eugenics** \\-- I'm listening to this right now, it's needless to say dark, but interesting.\n\n**Believe in Magic** \u2013 Scam/Munchausen\n\n**Chameleon: Dr. Dante** \\- lifelong huckster. Lots of folks weren't into it, but I'm old enough I remember some people I knew falling for some of his scams. I got a kick out of it.\n\n**Conflicted: A History Podcast: Stock Market Crash of '29 -** Okay, this isn't what you asked for but I compulsively plug this series. I usually can't pay attention when people just tell a story from history, but this was riveting. It unfolded like a movie. Host did an incredible job. Still well-edited, scripted, etc.  \n\n\n**Cool Mules** \\- the cocaine smuggling ring inside VICE media\n\n**Cover Story: Power Trip** \\-- Shockingly, \"teachers\" in an unregulated teaching role are alleged to be creepers.  \n\n\n**Darknet Diaries** \\-  Gollumfun episode -- one of the first internet swindlers  \n\n\n**Death by Conspiracy** \\- sad and oddly structured podcast about a British man who got sucked into Covid conspiracy. So well-produced I think it went too far for some. Worked for me.  \n\n\n**Dynamite Dave** \\- Solid sound design. Expose re Indonesian art obtained under suspicious circumstances.\n\n(to be continued)",

                            "comment": "**Love Bombed** \\- podcast about a lying liar and lying lies they lied about. Liar.\n\n**Love+Radio - Gotcha Part 1 and 2** \\- conwoman. Love+Radio is famous for its production. Episodes can go dark though.\n\n**New Gurus** \\- So good, very recent pod about the new thought leaders, for lack of a better phrase. I would listen to T**hings Fell Apart: Weird Tales from the history of America\u2019s Culture Wars** (weird to Jon Ronson maybe, but not weird to me, one of my favorite podcasts); **NYT Rabbit Hole**; and then this. Much of the same material with updates. Plus some very new to me information.\n\n**The Opportunist** \\- all episodes are good, but my favorite is the Rehab Mogul/Chris Bathum series, one of my favorite heroes in podcasting is in this series. \n\n**The Orgasm Cult** \\- about One Taste cult. It gets really dark, but so well produced.\n\n**Outside/In: The Underdogs -**  About a crime in the Iditarod community. Fascinating.\n\n**The Plot Thickens** \\- Pam Grier season is more like a history lesson. Absolutely fascinating life Pam has led and the sound design is top notch.\n\n**Pretend: The Stalker** \\-- sound production isn't that great but the story makes up for it. Or maybe not. The people involved might drive you insane.\n\n**Prohfiles: The Wrath of the Buzzard** \\- story about a groundbreaking radio station. Good sound design.\n\n**Rabbit Hole** \\- Look for the Rabbit Hole produced by The New York Times. See New Gurus, above.\n\n**The Renner Files** \\- genuine but also parody of investigative podcasts. Production is off the charts, because they're making fun of that in addition to several other things. One of my favorite pods. One of the funniest things I've ever heard.\n\n**Scamanda** \\- Still dropping, destined to become a classic I think.\n\n**Shrink Next Door** \\- GOAT, you might already know the story, IMO one of the godfathers of raising the bar of sound design in podcasting\n\n**Smokescreen: The Sellout** \\- Boyle Heights rep sells out his neighborhood and his people. Unbelievable sound design, music slaps.\n\n**Something Was Wrong** \\- Sound design isn't quite as ornate, but Season 2 and 3 are compelling, cancer faker and family ruiner.\n\n**Standoff** \\- Fascinating Story of the longest prison standoff in US History. Jailhouse phone calls are crystal clear. My spidey senses tell me you'll really like this but it does go dark. Don't want to spoil. Not as dark as it could go, but it\u2019s the darkest on this list maybe.\n\n**Sweet Bobby** \\- thin but compelling romance scam story\n\n**Sympathy Pains** \\- podcast about a woman you want to yeet to the moon\n\n**Things Fell Apart: Weird Tales from America\u2019s Culture Wars** \\- see New Gurus, above\n\n**Tiffany Dover is Dead** \\- Covid Conspiracy.\n\n**Twin Flames** \\-  throwback romance brainwash huckster bullcrap - but very well told\n\n**Unravel: Snowball** \\- GOAT podcast about romance/business scam.\n\n**Verified: full disclosure -** heavy podcast about police corruption in Phoenix AZ\n\n**WeCrashed** \\- story of WeWork\n\n**White Saviors** \\- Expose of Canadian WE Charity\n\n**Wild Boys** \\- I consider this a cult podcast. Won't spoil it more. Parentless brothers with a story show up in a small town.\n\n**Will Be Wild** \\- January 6 Insurrection",

In the early 80s cuban detainees took over the roof of the prison they were being held out without due process. The Embedded team sets out to figure out their story. Some feel it wandered too far into conspiracy, which I'll conceded, but I was still engrossed in the story.\n\n**Ernie\u2019s Secret** \\- From Witnessed docs -- fascinating story of renowned Civil Rights Photographer who informs of the FBI\n\n**Evaporated** \\- Exploration of a Japanese phenomenon of the \"Disappeared\". Can get a bit goofy at times, but still an interesting premise and well structured pod.\n\n**Filthy Ritual** \\- can binge on Global Player if all the episodes haven't dropped yet. Solid sound design. International conwoman.\n\n**Finding Drago** \\- kind of a parody of true crime podcasting, fun podcast about trying to find the author of some fan fiction. Follow it up with trying to find the world's youngest filmmaker in  - **Finding Desperado**\n\n**Foretold** \\- production is on the less ornate side, about a Romany fortune teller who leaves her culture. Really interesting.\n\n**The Gateway: Teal Swan** \\- white guru .... stuff.\n\n**God of Depression** \\- fascinating podcast about William Styron. Someone who idolizes his work ends up helping him. Don't want to spoil more. Sound design is spectactular.\n\n**Headlong: Running From Cops** \\- expose about the TV Show cops.\n\n**Here be Monsters:** Extraordinary sound design, that\u2019s kind of his thing. Not available on Spotify. I suggest starting with Ancient Roman Recipes episode to see if you dig.\n\n**Imposters: The Commander** \\- not the most top notch production, but if you're into romance con stories, it's a romance con story\n\n**Into the Depths** \\- part personal journal, part TC adjacent -- journalist volunteers for all all-black scuba diving group that recovers sunken slave ships. Spectacular production.\n\n**Just Enough Family** \\- Designer Liz Lange's family story. Growing up obliviously rich and family legacies.\n\n**Lies We Tell** (Luminary original): Fascinating series about lying. Professional production but not the best of the bunch. And exclusive to Luminary.\n\n(to be continued)",

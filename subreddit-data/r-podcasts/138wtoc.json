It is highly rated and many comments say it was helpful for them.\n\n[https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-worst-girl-gang-ever/id1524031149](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-worst-girl-gang-ever/id1524031149) This one is similar to the previous one, two hosts with a guest each episode talking about different things relating to miscarriage. Highly rated and well reviewed.\n\nI hope one of these is able to help, and I'm so very sorry this has happened to you.",

The podcast was the host documenting her journey of finding a sperm donor, trying IUI, and then several rounds of IVF that didn\u2019t take, then a successful IVF led to a pregnancy, but she needed a D&amp;C in the 2nd trimester to terminate due to anencephaly. She did some episodes processing that loss on the main feed with interviews and just feeling her feelings. \n\nAfter that, she found it hard to stay quite so public so she continued the show on a Patreon-only feed where she has now had a successful pregnancy last year and has her baby girl now.\n\nThe podcast is generally fun, but when things were hard, she shared with big and honest feelings. It can be nice to remember that other people have been there. \n\nHopefully other people have more recommendations for you. I truly wish you the best \ud83d\udc9c",

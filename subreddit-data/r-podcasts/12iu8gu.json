    "postText": "I am not a fan of churches that weave in right-wing politics into their sermons, of which there are many, I\u2019m aware. Can anyone recommend a left-leaning or at least politically neutral podcast with sermons? I\u2019m most familiar with non-denominational or Methodist churches but I\u2019ll take what I can get. \n\nThe difficulty I have is that, from what I\u2019ve searched, very few churches will publicly display their political leanings on their podcast description. Although sometimes I drive by churches that have the LGBTQA+ flag flying. Maybe I should check if they have websites or podcasts. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has a recommendation, I\u2019d appreciate it! Thanks in advance!",

If you like them, try one of the Podcasts from the Center for Action and Contemplation. Richard Rohr has another great one there called \u2018Another Name for Everything\u2019 which goes deeper than what a sermon/homily would usually.",

They can literally lose their non-profit status if they go to far in telling people how to vote. I mean, in this day and age, they don't. Both sides basically drive their side to the polls or scare the living shit out of their side from the pulpit, but.... it used to be that Pastors and Ministers were better than that.\n\nNow they all live in the mud, and it's simply a matter of degrees as to how deep in the mud they are. Do they hint, or do they tell. The US has more and more of the latter now, and, it's not a good thing. I don't give a crap which side they're pushing for....",

But the content of what\u2019s being spoken about almost has to have a leaning, which is why I have a preference. \n\nFor instance, before I moved, I used to go to a church that would hint their leaning when they would mention that the church/God et al is accepting of *all* sexual orientations. Or they might mention something along the lines of \u201cwhether Adam was the first hominid to tune into God with a prefrontal cortex or what-have-you\u2026\u201d etc. clearly showing that the church does not disagree with evolution/science. \n\nWith that, I\u2019m not trying to listen to sermons that literally talk politics or of politicians, just that they generally accept and agree with things that left leaning politics accept and agree with. I hope that clears up what I mean and what I\u2019m looking for.",

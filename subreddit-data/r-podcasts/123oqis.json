    "postText": "Exactly what the title says. There was a podcast podcast i saw a clip of a week ago on twitter and decided to check out on youtube but I didn't really care to remember the name of the hosts or the name of the podcasts and have had no luck finding it. All I remember is that the hosts was 2 women in their their 40's( they mentioned it in an episode). I don't know the exact type of podcast it could be described as ( they talked about their marriage, anniversary's in one episode) I know that's very little to go on but is there anyway to search for podcasts with this criteria. Or might someone happen to know the podcast I'm referring to.",

It's hosted by two older, hottie ladies and it's one of those podcasts that are kinda better to watch, if that makes sense?  Their clip about [how much they hate 'manifesting'](https://youtu.be/iri4c1Hlbew) is really funny.",

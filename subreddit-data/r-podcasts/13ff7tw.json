    "postText": "This something I've been thinking about recently. Does anyone know of any podcasts that focus on the life of one particular person?\n\nI don't mean a famous person, but just an 'average joe' who happened to have a fascinating life - living through war, social upheaval, coups and the like.\n\nSurely it would be fascinating to hear about the unique experiences of someone who actually lived though some of the more interesting historical periods over the last century.\n\nCan anyone think of any podcasts like this? I'd love to hear some recommendations.",

Loose, lewd, and louche retellings of some of history's strangest folks, which might not scratch that itch\n\n* **Teddy Goes to the USSR** - six part series of one relatively average American's trip to the USSR in 1968, though only focuses on one part of his life\n\n* **Adventures with Dead Jews** (Tablet) - a look at some (relatively minor) Jewish figures and the impact they had\n\n* **Antique Tea** - gossip, but historical (defunct?) \n\n* **A Very Square Peg: A Podcast Series About Polymath Robert Eisler** - perhaps too niche and obtuse, but an interesting overview of an interesting man\n\nAgain, none of these are exactly what you want, but might be of interest.",

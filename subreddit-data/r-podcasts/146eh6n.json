    "postText": "Hi! Looking for podcasts on education, particularly US education but I\u2019d be fine with anything! I\u2019ve listened to all of the APM Reports educational documentaries and loved them, so I\u2019d really love more that are similar to that. I\u2019m not looking for podcasts on how to be a teacher but more issues teachers/colleges/students are facing, current state of education, scandals, experienced with for-profit universities, etc. I don\u2019t want true crime. I\u2019ve heard already:\n\n- Sold a Story\n- All of the APM Reports Educate documentaries\n- Nice White Parents\n- Gangster Capitalism \n- Reveal and all of their episodes about education \n- This Land\u2019s episodes about Indian Boarding Schools \n- TTAM\u2019s episode on Argosy\n\nThank you in advance!!",

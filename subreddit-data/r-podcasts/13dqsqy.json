Using the RSS feed at [https://rss.wbur.org/onpoint/podcast](https://rss.wbur.org/onpoint/podcast), the app will only download JPG images and will not stream or download audio. I've contacted the host WBUR about this but get no reply. Is there a way to look at the feed contents to see if they are formatted correctly?",

I've never had this issue and I have 20+ other feeds that work just fine, so I wonder what is different about this one. \n\nThanks for helping me narrow it down. I really don't want to switch apps, so I may just not listen to On Point. I wasn't certain it would make the regular playlist anyway.",

I want to ask if there are any podcast sites that you can search for podcasts by time duration for instance 50 minutes or more in time length. I prefer longer time lengths (I listen on Youtube to a few that I really enjoy, such as Oki's Weird Stories / Barely Sociable / Swindled, etc.   \nHowever, they don't post that often, because I know it takes a lot of time to research topics/prepare, etc.  Thanks for any info/feedback.",

For using the advance search filter it requires paid membership, so I am not sure whether i will subscribe, it looks like it might be more for podcasters that want assistance to get their podcasts on various podcast networks.",

Hopefully others might post even more options (it is good to have multiple options, but so far Podchase looks to be exactly what I was looking for).",

So far Podchaser is great. I like to have other options though, I will post if I find other sites",

When I tried to create a free account (it says Create A Podcaset) I am only looking to listen to podcasts. So far I haven't found a podcast network that has a time duration filter (on website browser listening). I think Spotify might have had one in the past because I saw an old forum post from 2019 where someone mentioned it no longer works (and i don't see it currently). I don't want to pay to join other podcast hosting sites unless it has the sort or filter by time duration.",

Thanks for mentioning Suncloud player I forgot about that app. I see a post here that indicates in 2022 the filter search by time duration/length is no longer available. I have to imagine this feature of searching for podcasts by time duration isn't readily available on most podcast hosting sites, as my post already has over 1400 views  Thanks very much.",

For the suggestions they made though (podast hosting sites, I haven't found one yet that allows to either filter or sort by podcast time duration.  It looks like the listennotes .com site has a time filter but the price looks to be cost prohibitive (like over $100 a month for a subscription, so it is more for podcasters).  I emailed Listennotes support but haven't heard back from them yet. I would think that a web developer might have created a web scraper that can search for podasts based on time length, I don't have the skills or time to do this myself, or perhaps it is more complicated then I realize.",

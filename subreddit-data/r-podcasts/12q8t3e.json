Two-host format is okay if it is tightly edited and they aren\u2019t trying to fill an hour with chit-chat. In-depth research is a plus. \n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed:\n-Articles of Interest (season 3 especially)\n-Michael Hobbes-era YWA \n-Land of the Giants\n-Seasons 1 and 2 of Slow Burn\n-Against the Rules\n-Cautionary Tales\n-some eras of You Must Remember This (don\u2019t Iove how she just reads the script though)\n\nI do not care for Stuff You Should Know.\n\nETA: oh my gosh, thanks to everyone who responded with so many great recommendations!! So many of these sound good. I look forward to referring back to this thread many times!",

The consistent length episodes are digestible, and the variable length of series gives the story room to breathe.  \n\nAlso, if you haven't listened to Revolutions with Mike Duncan, you are in luck, because it's complete, and you can binge the entire thing if you want to. And you will want to sometimes. Other times, like Dan Carlin, you'll want to sit with it and reflect.  I've listened at least twice, and some seasons more than twice.\n\nAnd also, I would just in general recommend any of the miniseries that Robert Evans &amp; crew (on iHeartRadio) do. Their regular stuff is conversational, but their miniseries are really tight and focused.  These include \"The Women's War\" (on the Syrian Kurds who defeated isis and had to build an egalitarian society from the ruins) and the first several episodes of It Could Happen Here\".  And several others.  \n\n\nHappy listening!",

    "postText": "I am fascinated by the present and near future, particularly in regards to topics that concern and impact our lives today and in the years to come. Artificial intelligence, the future of work, and related subjects are areas I find particularly captivating. Moreover, I have a keen interest in political topics, including the future of democracy, social media's role in society, and the increasing polarization and division amongst us.\n\nCurrently, I am an avid listener of the Ezra Klein Show. I am eager to expand my podcast repertoire and discover other shows that delve into similar themes.\n\nAny suggestions you could provide would be greatly appreciated, as I am excited to broaden my understanding.\n\nThank you in advance for your suggestions.",

The questions he is asking himself in the small, dark hours see to that. Are we going to run out of food? Is it already too late to stop climate change? Should I start learning Mandarin? Are killer death robots from the future already among us? Will my kids grow up to see a real tiger or giraffe? Why hasn\u2019t anyone yet made an intelligent hairbrush? Oh they have? As you were\u2026\nPlaying on his own paranoia Jon will discuss his fears with guarded optimists Ed Gillespie and Mark Stevenson aka \u2018The Futurenauts\u2019. Authors, futurists and provocateurs, to ease Jon\u2019s angst Ed and Mark take him on adventures through the futures we need that already exist today.",

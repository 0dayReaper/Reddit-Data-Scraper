Asides from the morbid fascination of a tragedy I think myself and a lot of other women find comfort in knowing everything we can so that if we're ever in those situations we have the best chance of survival. Yes I've learned how to commit the perfect murder (mwahahaha), but I've also learned how to decrease the chances of being murdered, decrease the chances of angering my captor, increase my chances of being found, learn how to leave evidence if it's become obvious I won't survive etc.  \nThere's not a lot you can do when you've been hurt or kidnapped beyond fighting back (or not if the situation calls for it), but what I do know might save my life someday and I think maybe a lot of other women feel the same.   \nIf you're worried, start making your own food, women are big on poisoning lol",

I haven\u2019t been able to listen to true crime since the pandemic, but before the pandemic, it was because my life was going super well but I needed some form of discomfort to feel normal again. So perhaps this is a sign that her life is going well \ud83d\ude1a",

I\u2019m quite happy in my marriage and with my family. I think I have a fascination w/ dark &amp; gory shit because of past trauma and my relentless urge to rise above and appreciate what I have. It\u2019s kind of a strange coping mechanism I think, like: look how FUCKED the world can be compared to what I\u2019ve gone through. Maybe I\u2019m a LOT A BIT morbid, but I\u2019m harmless AND GRATEFUL. I\u2019m not plotting anything or planning anything evil. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite. When I read/see/witness something HORRIFIC, I actually use it as fuel to reflect and take note of my blessings amidst my own suffering and pain, and in contrast, mine often pales in comparison, thus giving me gratitude and acceptance, and also profound sadness; all of which I try my best to utilize in a healthy and productive manner, for example: I see a person be headed... I instantly think of their pain and fear. I then, think of my empathy for them. Next, I imagine it as me or a loved one, next, I imagine their loved ones. In the end, I\u2019m sorry for everyone, and so pissed at the perpetrators and feel relief that my family and life story hasn\u2019t gone THAT far. At the end of it all I feel educated and a bit cleansed. I still feel fucked up, but can\u2019t help but feel a glimmer of hope because my life and those in my circle haven\u2019t at least descended to those depths. I do this thinking wholeheartedly always keeping victims in my mind forever, feeling deep sadness for them, and extremely wishing they had some kind of comfort in their horrible experience of death (though I\u2019m not convinced). The best I can do is bear witness, be outraged and do my best to protect myself and family. For some reason I constantly seek all this shit....",

I think it's truly because women are far more likely to be victims, we have an interest in hearing about true crime as a protective factor. A lot of creeps in the stories use clever tricks to convince women they are safe. I feel better informed and more powerful knowing what to avoid. These podcasts reinforce following your intuition and it's comforting. Sadly, women have to think about this anytime they walk, run, go hiking, etc. alone. Men have the luxury of not worrying about this most of the time.",

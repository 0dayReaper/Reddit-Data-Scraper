I vaguely remember one of the characters may have been a teenager? But one was definitely a repair man and they fought a smoke monster in the back room of a mall in the first episode. I\u2019m dying trying to find this please help oh powerful ones.\nFound it!! It\u2019s called Late to the Party! Thanks for looking everyone and definitely give it a listen",

There's tons and tons of random APs with very small audiences and it's presumably one of them, since someone likely would have recognized it by now if it was any of the bigger shows.

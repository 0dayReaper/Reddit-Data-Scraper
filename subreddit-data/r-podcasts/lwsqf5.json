I was a season one fan, so listened to season two as it came out.\n\nLook is this enough for a conviction?  No.  Did the DA badly want one?  Yes.  So, he thought he probably had the guy, and fudged a bunch of stuff to make it look even worse.\n\nBut there's certainly a case against Curtis.",

Thank you for answering though, I was genuinely curious how you formed that opinion.\n\nEdit to add: Damaging property when he worked there isn\u2019t a motive. It can be, but it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that anyone will commit mass murder because they f\u2019ed up at work and quit. \n\nThe uncle\u2019s missing gun may be the murder weapon, we can\u2019t know for sure unless they test fired the gun. And how does that link to Curtis? \n\nThere\u2019s more, but my point is that the evidence is beyond circumstantial because it\u2019s based on assumption.",

There are also some episodes produced after the podcast was finished addressing the wittnesses. They all recanted. \n\nBallistic evidence is very controversial and more of an art than a science. And if i recall correctly, they never recovered the weapon. Its been awhile since ive listened as well. \n\nThe police and Doug Evans got tunnell vision, it happens all the time.  He did not do it.",

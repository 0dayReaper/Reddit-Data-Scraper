    "postText": "My favorite thing about this podcast was the interesting family dynamics and unconventional relationships between the characters (Antigone and the funeral guy, the mayor and his boyfriend etc.) It was really wholesome and sweet. The atmosphere of the cozy small town was just the cherry on top. If anyone knows of fiction podcasts with a similar vibe and interesting storyline, I'd love to check them out!",

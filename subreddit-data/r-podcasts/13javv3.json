It\u2019s changed over the years naturally, but there\u2019s gold in them there archives! One of my favorite things of anything ever is the Breakup episode, in particular the segment by Starlee Kine. (Act II I think?) That\u2019s how I fell in love with Phil Collins. I\u2019ll just leave that there. Lol \n\nAnd then some of the eps of *Snap Judgment* are along similar lines, but some are more serious than others. I would offer titles but don\u2019t know them off the top! Wish I did! Cowboy Bob I know I loved, and the one about the treasure hunt. (The two-parter on Search for No Name Aporva (sp?) was \ud83e\udd2f but that one is definitely not light.)",

It\u2019s Gretchen and her sister talking life hacks and suchness. But very upbeat conversational: One is more Type A and the other is more the creative type,  so they have different perspectives and takes on things.",

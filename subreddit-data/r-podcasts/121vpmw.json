I don\u2019t even know how I found heavyweight, but it was one of those exactly what I needed at the time things, and yeah, I dunno, but I seriously feel so comforted immediately when I put him on. Listening on mushrooms sounds so good, except I always laugh too hard on mushrooms at nothing, and I think I would actually pass out from laughing if it was a funny one.",

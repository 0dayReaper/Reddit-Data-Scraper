    "postText": "I'm looking for a podcast on the history of fashion. I would like it to have at least two hosts, or a host and a guest so that there's some back and forth about the subject. I've tried Dressed: The History of Fashion, and while I learn a lot, I find the scripts to be a bit stilted and their jokes forced and unfunny. Ideally, I'd love to find one that dives into the reasons fashion evolved in particular ways, and gives at least an overview of the political climate if that was the cause (i.e. French Revolution, Bolshevik Revolution, etc.).",

She has enough personality for two.\n\nSeriously though, her stuff is very well-produced with interviews etc so hopefully that counts.\n\nI recommend Articles of Interest: American Ivy if you don\u2019t already know it.",

            "comment": "Disobeying your parameters to bring Christiane Nickel's German Fashion History podcast to your attention.\n\nIt started out with a history of DDR aka East German fashion. Christiane sounds as though she is reading a script so there is no back and forth between hosts. But there is much about the interplay between the communist regime, political principles and fashion. You might find it interesting. I have no interest in fashion and found it interesting.\n\nhttps://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2930541",

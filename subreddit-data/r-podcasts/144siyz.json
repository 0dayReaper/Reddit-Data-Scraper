    "postText": "It could have been before 2008, but NPR had its first podcast that was hosted by young people that, was different than the This American Life, Radiolab podcasts. It was never a radio show it was only a podcast. I think it was hosted by a man and a woman, but it could have been more people. Does anyone remember this? I'm going to hope I can find old episodes online.",

Every week, he weaves together the stories of various guests around a specific topic. His introductions are a journey, grounded in the best of the oral storytelling tradition; his vivid language is only aided by the sumptuous soundscape that puts you in the moment.

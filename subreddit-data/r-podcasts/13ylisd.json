    "postText": "Recently I've started listening to Brian Atlas' \"social experiment\" called the Whatever podcast. His show features a panel of guests, usually about 4-5 women and 2-3 men, who discuss dating and relationships. Each episode is usually &gt;4 hours long (which is why I sometimes skip parts or just look at clips on YouTube). The discussions are interesting, but some of the people on there irk me a little bit. For example, a lot of the men on there obsess over a girls' body count. I don't understand why it matters so much unless she's a sex addict or is catching STIs. They also discuss feminism and gender roles on the show which I enjoy, but it usually ends up being the men steamrolling on the women and saying some questionable to ridiculous statements. It veers into Andrew Tate terriroty, but still stays a comfortable distance away from him and his views. My favorite episodes so far are the Michael Knowles episode (ep. 61) and the Destiny episode (ep. 75). I enjoy listening to the debates and discussions that naturally arise in these episodes. The one thing I do not like about the show is how the Superchats always interrupt the guests. The Superchats can sometimes give interesting questions, but at times they are rude and disrespectful to the women on the show. I wish Brian would filter the Superchats or at least not have them interrupt the guests. So does anyone else listen to this show? Curious to hear others' opinions.",

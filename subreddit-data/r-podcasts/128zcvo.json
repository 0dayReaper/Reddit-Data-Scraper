So don\u2019t worry they might have heard something before. \n\nThey have shorter attention spans and will likely lose their place not being super tech savvy- so individual episodes over series are better.\n\nThey lean left politically- so I can sprinkle a political one in here and there.\n\nPriority would be fun, historical, or comedic and bonus points if it\u2019s stories that take place in the 60s, 70s, or 80s they can reflect on. \n\nThank you all in advanced!\n\nJust throw me your best ofs!",

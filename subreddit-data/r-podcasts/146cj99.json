    "postText": "Hello i am a big fan of the youtube channel \"Shrouded Hand\" and i really like the fact that this channel talk about many topics about horrors, like paranormal event, true crime and creepy historical fact. However many youtube channel or podcast about horror, seem to be far less diverse in their theme, so i would like to know podcast that talk about horror with as mush diversity as Shrouded Hand do.",

            "comment": "Dark Histories (you need the plural) is great! It\u2019s probably my most-listened to podcast since the pandemic started. The host, Ben, does a ton of (actual, non-Wikipedia) research for every episode and he has a very healthy attitude towards the \u201csupernatural\u201d stuff. He especially does a great job of looking through old newspapers for primary sources of more modern crime/horror content.\n\nI really like that he reads his script about the story, more of a narration, really, and then unpacks the story at the end. He has also has a calming (but not boring!) voice and doesn\u2019t constantly crack jokes at other people\u2019s misfortunes or experiences, like a ton of other crime/horror podcasts. (But there is the occasional joke or laugh when describing something that\u2019s blatantly ridiculous!)",

Mostly creepy historical topics, but impressively diverse with detours into world folklore, hauntings, weird 19th century serial killers, etc. If you like Shrouded Hand you\u2019ll love this one.\n\nOn the more comedic side, Last Podcast on the Left. They\u2019ve covered everything from recent true crime cases to aliens to historical calamities like the Black Death. Plus they do weekly roundups of creepy news stories.\n\nI haven\u2019t listened to all of it but Uncanny from the BBC is also a good bet! Mostly ghost stories but the UFO episodes are quite good.",

    "postText": "I'm a new podcast listener, but I haven't had much luck. As the title suggests, I'm looking for podcasts with no banter that get straight to the point. I liked \"Beach too sandy, water too wet\" and \"normal gossip\" but I didn't continue either because of the talk in between. It would be perfect if they could read only the reviews/the gossip. Examples of podcasts I've liked are \"philosophize this\" (love his narration, chill but gets to the point) and the \"edge of sleep\".",

Despite the dark subject matter, the tone manages to be pretty light and a little humorous most of the time. \n\nThe banter is kept to an absolute minimum. Just a joke or comment now and then. The editing is tight and they stay on-topic at all times. \n\nOne thing, the prologue episode does have a comedy sketch guest-starring H. Jon Benjamin and James Adomian, but that's not how the rest of it goes. You can skip it, no problem, if you're not feeling it.",

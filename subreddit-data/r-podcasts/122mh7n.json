They have a guest on every episode to talk about small moments that changed their lives. \n\nBig Mood Little Mood is an advice and relationships podcast hosted by Daniel M Laverty. It's pretty LGBT-focused (although not exclusively). Daniel is a trans guy. \n\nThe Allusionist covers queer words and language sometimes (hosted by a straight ciswoman, but she's absolutely an ally and does have queer guests on). It's kind of outside your perameters, but it is such an excellent podcast, maybe you'll like it. It's about language/words. They've covered Polari, Queer, Queer-bating, Rainbow-washing, and Pride. There's also been stuff about gender and pronouns hither and yon.",

It's a comedy podcast about low-stakes drama, the stories aren't always queer centred but the host is gay so I'm not sure if that falls into what you're looking for. Mysteries &amp; Histories by Georgia Marie is a true crime and history podcast, she's queer and sometimes incorporates queer education/topics, e.g. in the recent episode 89: Fred the Head. Also for true crime you could try That's Spooky, or And That's Why We Drink but they both also incorporate paranormal topics. Sorry if this isn't what you're looking for as they aren't explicitly about trans and queer topics, it's more that most of the hosts of these are within the community.",

    "postText": "I think history is fascinating but I struggle to dive into too much by myself because it\u2019s such a broad subject. Is there a history podcast that basically uses a story format? Ideally something that can make it funny/more upbeat at the same time and not be focused on WWII. \n\nI saw a tweet that said the way to get someone interested in your sports team was to tell them all of the gossip about it and I would love that approach to history.",

Also hard to know what might tickle your fancy too\u2026\n\n20.08.21 - Ivan the terrible is good ep. I only knew headlines and had a kind of \u2018bill and ted\u2019 level knowledge on the subject.\n\n05.08.22 - Black Georgian Britain - this was an ep that they made in response to people moaning about the Netflix series Bridgerton. There were a lot of idiots and racists saying that there weren\u2019t black people in high society \u2026 but this ep gives some interesting facts about the black population of the U.K from that era and shows that although fiction, Bridgerton was more than possible.\n\n26.08.22 - The history of timekeeping- this was a really interesting ep\u2026I might be saying that as I\u2019m a bit biased. the cohost for this ep is Desiree Burch who I think is ace, and I love anything she guests on)\u2026. But it definitely taught me some stuff that I feel I should possibly have had an idea about!\n\nBut\u2026.. if I was going to pick just 1 ep to recommend it would be 21.07.22 Frederick the great of Prussia - the co host is Stephen Fry who is supposed to be the light relief but is (as always) stunningly knowledgeable\u2026. Anything with Stephen fry as a guest is going to be rad\u2026 and this ep was interesting (not a historical era/figure I knew much about at all) and entertaining too.",

And I agree, it can be difficult to recommend something if the person asking hasn't laid out any preferences. In this case though, I was fully prepared to lean on any tip to help me get a first check on the massive backlog. I would usually start at the beginning, though I've learned that some podcasts  need some episodes to pass to \"get into their groove\" they become known for.  \n\n\nThough... as serendipity wants it, I'll absolute soak up anything Stephen Fry. I literally could listen to him go on about basically anything. So yeah, I now have the very first episode I'll give a try tonight.   \n\n\nLastly, for highest quality Fry content, I'll recommend to you his Seven Deadly Sins podcast. It's what he does best, language, knowledge and smarts wrapped into one entertaining experience. (It's accessible on the same feed as his Great Leap Years series. So possibly two miniseries for you to look into...)",

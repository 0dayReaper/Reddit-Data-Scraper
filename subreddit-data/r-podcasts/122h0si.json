Also I think I should go over grammar again (I was never really taught properly) so if you guys know anything (even if it\u2019s not a podcast) then please let me know. \n\nThank you in advance!",

She mentions them in [this video](https://youtu.be/yekG8LBfLgk). It would be helpful for you to download the BBC Sounds app too. I hope they are helpful and at an appropriate level for you.",

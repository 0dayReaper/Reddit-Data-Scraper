Phone goes outside the door and I wear an old pair of cheap Bluetooth earbuds that I don't care much about. \n\nThe wire between the earbuds gets pretty hot, so I don't have that around my neck. The heat from the sauna could permanently reduce the battery life of any lithium battery that goes in there, but my earbuds were already down to less than half their original battery life before I ever took them into the sauna, which is why they were no longer in regular use.",

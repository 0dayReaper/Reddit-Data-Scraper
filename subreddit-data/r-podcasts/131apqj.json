    "postText": "I checked a few podcasts I found on the web, and all of them seem to be either just market news, general financial literacy podcasts or very focused on specific markets (U. S. usually) and conditions. I just want to find a podcast with fundamentals: how to analyze a company, differences between X and Y, terminology. Just something which would be relevant even 10 years from now.",

If it's ultra specific I can ask around (I'm a banker). I know PGIM had a pretty good podcast on bonds but it was more market conditions talk.\n\nA lot of finance topics don't lend themselves to audio as a format, so that's another big issue.",

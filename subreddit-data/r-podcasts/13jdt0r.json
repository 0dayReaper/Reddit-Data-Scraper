Right now my main podcasts are The Big Picture, The Film Vault, The Rewatchables, How Did This Get Made, and a handful of TV show reaction pods. I got my degree in film so I do enjoy discussions about the substance, meaning and technical achievements of movies but I also like shows that are about the entertainment and nostalgia of film.",

The season that hooked me was the one about Song of the South, whew!  This season is about sex in the nineties and very cool to hear about how some of the films came about and old reviews, like Thelma and Louise.  I don\u2019t agree with her about Pretty Woman though.  YMRT is one of my favorites, as you can tell!",

            "comment": "One of my favourite podcasts of all time, not just in the film category, is \"Cancelled Movie Report\". Two Australian podcasters going through stories about films that never got made, while also doing really well produced audio-drama recreations of the scripts. A lot of big blockbuster titles/sequels.\n\nI'm also loving a recent show called \"Blockblunders\" where two comedians (and occasionally guests) try to outline the plot of a famous movie they've never seen using only a cast list and cultural osmosis. \n\nI'd also second some of the other recommendations here, like Film Reroll, Worst Idea of All time, etc",

His cohost was a WGN radio host who was really good too. One of my  favorites is there list of best US produced war movies. It was really entertaining.\n\nRichard Roeper's current one The Roeper Show is good too.\n\nI also like Ben Mankowitz's movie podcast The  Plot Thickens. Season 1 with Peter Bogdanovich is especially good.",

They\u2019re both ridiculous movie nerds and the discussion each week reveals not only more about the movies but their relationship and how two generations navigate politics and beliefs. \n\nPlus since they both have done public speaking for a living and grew up as a family discussing movies, they\u2019re just funny and quick. Each episode ends with a piece of fatherly advice they each took away from the movie. V fun and unique \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/6gPt5xClSryxcJvfEveySL?si=UjGgdteaSTmWLj6cDKsHsA",

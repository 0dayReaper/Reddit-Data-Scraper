When I went back and caught up on the pre-covid stuff they were talking about all these neat museum openings and such that were supposed to happen over the summer and they were all excited about them. It actually kinda hurt to listen to, knowing those things ended up never happening.",

I mean, from my perspective it feels like they\u2019ve only become more generally well-known and acknowledged over the past few months, but that could just be me. I definitely discovered a lot more podcasts over lockdown than I did before because I had the time to explore a bit more and I feel like that\u2019s what a lot of people have been doing. \n\nI do get what you mean about finding it strange to catch up on episodes released pre-lockdown though. It just feels like a whole other world now and it\u2019s almost depressing remembering how much things have changed this year.",

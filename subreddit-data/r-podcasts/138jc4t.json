    "postText": "Hey there, I currently use Google Podcasts and it doesn't seem to sync very well across devices. I often switch phones throughout a day and thought that opening up the app on a different phone would have the currently playing podcast ready and waiting, up to the point I listened to on the other device and with my queue all there but it doesn't seem to do that. It's the same when i switch the desktop version of google podcasts also.\n\nIs there anyway I can make this happen? Are there any other apps that are better for this? Is this even possible?\n\nThanks!",

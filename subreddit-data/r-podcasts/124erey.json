I got to the end of \u201cfirst aid\u201d and there have been mentions of names that have popped up before that I have no clue when they were brought up before.(Jane Prentis and the name of the man who had the creepy book library.) And does anything ever get explained? Do we ever find out what was in the coffin, what the vampires are, why those dreams were happening, etc?\n\nI really like the podcast but I feel like I\u2019m not paying enough attention because I don\u2019t know these people and while the cliffhangers are creepy, I feel unfulfilled.",

You're in for a wild ride.\n\nI'd avoid the wiki and the subreddit -- it's really easy to get spoiled on stuff. Jonny Sims is a great writer, and I'd just trust that he'll make things/characters/places much more clear as the show builds.",

The really important names you\u2019ll figure out/remember eventually when they start popping up more, and they\u2019re pointed out in the episodes post statement typically filling some gaps.  I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re supposed to know Jane Prentis by this point and it\u2019s probably her first mention.  Most of your questions get answered but it\u2019s a slow burn.",

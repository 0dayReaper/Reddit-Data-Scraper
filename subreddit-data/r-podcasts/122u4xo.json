I love learning about stories/people/events that you wouldn't normally think about but end up finding fascinating when a story about them is told/produced nicely. Any suggestions? Would prefer actual episodes you'd recommend as well. Thank you!",

They unpack cultural phenomenons that you\u2019ve probably never thought twice about the origins of (ie the history of the mullet, the evolution of America\u2019s attitude towards Bart Simpson, the development of the Segway, etc). Great host and I love the production on that one.",

They pick an illness, treatment, or other subject and walk through the history of it. From patent medicines and folk remedies to brilliant doctors and scientists, they chronicle humanity's attempt to fix what ails them. It's at times funny, sad, disturbing, but always interesting.\n\nSome of my favorite episodes include: 276 The World of Warcraft Plague\n\n125 King of Quacks\n\n301 Taint Tanning\n\nPlus, they have holiday episodes, weird medical questions, brand histories, and themed live shows. \n\n\n\nMy new favorite is **A History of Rock in 500 Songs.** The host laid down an outline for the history of Rock music with each episode featuring one or more songs that influenced that trajectory. From its roots in jazz, blues, and folk music through Rock &amp; Roll and its many iterations in the 20th Century. He plans on ending it before the new millennium, encapsulating Rock through the 1990s.  \n\nIt's a good look into the history of the genre, music industry, and American culture overall.",

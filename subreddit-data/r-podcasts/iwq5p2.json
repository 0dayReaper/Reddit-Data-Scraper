He\u2019s maybe one of the most literate history enthusiasts in our time...and he is sounding the alarm bells of Civil War and mass insurrection.  He sees all of the shades of gray and ALWAYS asks you to consider context, the other side, the victors write the histories...etc.  He\u2019s concerned and we all should be as well.",

On one hand, it seems people can be observed acting rather insane and non-cooperative on a normal basis (I very much agree), but then at other times (under certain circumstances) it is also possible to observe these same *types* of people working collaboratively together.\n\nI wonder if the latter exceptional state might be achievable on a normal basis - has anyone ever tried to accomplish this?",

A civil war doesn't need to involve everyone to be a war.\n\nRight wingers have already shown their willingness to show up to protests heavily armed, even on the grounds of official political buildings. While less common, this has happened with liberal protesters too.\n\nAfter declaring he supported the nomination of a new justice, people started protesting right in front of Mitch McConnells house. I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if protests like this became very common if there is uncertainty about the outcome after the election. Judging by how easy it has been so far to convince people with propaganda, it seems likely that Trump supporters will see this as their representatives being in danger and will move en masse to protect them. A that point, a little spark is all it would take for serious shit to go down. This honestly doesn't seem outlandish to me.",

Like you, I don't think it's realistic to expect a civil war in 2020, though that doesn't mean we couldn't get there in a few more years. I think it's absolutely avoidable but we're making all the wrong moves currently. As Carlin says, we're steering into it.\n\nIn the near term I'm more worried that he'd declare the election invalid, the courts would back him up in some sort of bush v gore situation, and no one else would have the constitutional authority to say otherwise. I don't even know how the country could come back from that, the peaceful transfer of power to the winner of an election is the most basic thing in any form of democratic government.\n\nI don't think armed civilians are a relevant factor in 2020. Not yet. Hopefully not ever, but I agree with you-- people aren't ready to take up arms like that. There are a few more steps towards the abyss we'd need to take before that's truly on the table.",

Changing your mind should be encouraged. \n\nWhen Trump got elected my only comment on social media was: RIP Democracy. \n\nI wrote this for two reasons. Electing Donald Trump as the most powerful man on earth shows that people are too stupid for democracy. Second that Mr. Trump will literally try to extinguish democracy in America and supplant it with a cult if personality dictatorship. \n\nDan's support for Biden and his references to Adams show that this assessment is just as salient now as then. Trump is nothing other than obvious, I don't know how he fools anyone. \n\nIf Trump hinks he has any way to stay in power then he will. He has zero empathy or respect for any principal other than his own ego.",

Most traditional radio even today has a bombastic over the top style that I don\u2019t think really has anything to do with the host, just what was expected I guess. It took me a while to get used to it so I can understand not being able to get through it.",

I think that\u2019s a good thing in some ways, and bad in others. The bad is that by the time he records it, I bet he knows it so well that he\u2019s almost reciting it instead of explaining it. The difference in my opinion is, when someone is explaining or teaching something, they talk in a leading way that sort of directs your thinking and pulls you along. When I listen to Carlin, I feel like someone is reading back to me a well-written research paper that they wrote. The leading nature and emphasis disappears and you\u2019re left not knowing exactly what important bits you need to hang onto to build the narrative. You get lots of cool facts and stories but somehow lose the overall cohesion and relationship between it all. That\u2019s 100% my opinion, and I haven\u2019t listened to anything new of his in probably 3-4 years, so I\u2019m sure he has improved the production a lot. But this is why I couldn\u2019t get into him, personally.\n\nAlso, some of Carlin\u2019s early stuff was painfully low-volumed; did he fix that?",

I just gave the episode posted here a try and I couldn\u2019t get more than a minute in.  \n\nHis intro is also horrible.  Why hasn\u2019t anyone told him he\u2019s not a shock jock radio host?

Back in the day all radio hosts talked like that. Now a-days the only folks how really listen to traditional radio are old people, who are mainly conservatives, so the only really popular hosts now are conservatives. That\u2019s why when you hear it your mind immediately associates it with conservatives. Unfortunate that it does too, terrestrial radio didn\u2019t have to come to what it is today.",

But, history teaches us that it\u2019s really hard if not impossible to see where we are headed with any certainty because there are so many contradicting data points happening all at once.\n\nAs an example, the 9/11 attacks are often used to criticize the US government because there were warning signs and intelligence that something like that was being planned.  But there were thousands of possibilities, conflicting intel, lies, truths, incomplete pictures, etc at play.  It\u2019s convenient to look backwards and see the dots connect, but it would have been impossible to draw those lines forward with any certainty at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to point to authoritarian things Trump says, but Nixon said some of the same things and we survived.  The 1960s saw assassinations, riots, murders, etc.  but we survived.  9/11 happened and some of the most stringent surveillance measures were in acted taking away significant freedoms, but within 7 years we elected a black man to the Presidency who tamped down a lot of our worst impulses.  \n\nDan Carlin saying, \u201cno, I\u2019ve studied all of that and I\u2019m a realist...and I think this is worse\u201d is just a high value data point.",

In particular - when it comes to Nixon and later presidents, the presidency has been given increased power in relation to Congress over the past 50-60 years - a concept referred to as the \"imperial presidency.\" \n\nAlso, Trump's primary constituency, white evangelical Christians, were primed for him through decades of political conditioning that can be traced back to the 1970s - particularly the collaboration between Jerry Falwell Sr. and Republican operative Paul Weyrich, as well as the work of other GOP operatives like Lee Atwater. \n\nElecting President Obama was progress, but it can also be read as a blip in the trend downward towards what may end up being civil war &amp; authoritarianism. The country has become increasingly polarized politically and socially over the past several decades, and there were signs of it even while Obama was in office. Trump (or someone like him) is where we we've been headed for quite some time.\n\nNot all consequences are immediate, and not all trends are completely linear. Some take years and even decades, and IMO that's what's happening right now. Countries rarely ever go from a true, functional democratic republic with free &amp; fair elections to straight authoritarianism and/or civil war overnight.",

Of course, none of us will know for sure until quite some time from now - that's the tough part about these thought exercises. But I would agree with Carlin and others that we're closer to 1860-1861. The partisan divide has been occurring for awhile, and the genesis can be traced back decades. \n\nMy money is on 1964-1968, because prior to that, the parties were more geography-based and to a degree class-based than purely ideological - there were liberals and conservatives in both major parties, Republicans tended to be more pro-business and Democrats more pro-labor (though even that's not absolute), but that's about as far as the ideology went. The mid-to-late 1960s was the point in which black Americans became more solidly Democrat (a trend that began around the 1930s), and conservative Southern Democrats began to trickle out of the Democratic Party - due to LBJ and his support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But it took much longer for Southern conservatives to commit to the GOP. \n\nIMO the 1960s was our 1844 (or maybe 1820? - due to the Missouri Compromise), but again, it'll be hard to know for sure until some time from now.",

They both advocate for dramatically expanding the supreme court and changing it to operate the same way that the federal circuit courts do, where panels of judges are selected at random from the pool to hear cases but all the justices could convene together for particular cases.  \n[https://time.com/5338689/supreme-court-packing/](https://time.com/5338689/supreme-court-packing/)\n\nA larger pool would lead to higher turnover so installing partisan justices has a smaller effect.\n\nAnd if they wrote the legislation to expand it by 2 every 2 years instead of all at once, it would allow for moderation by future administration picks.",

I\u2019m not so much a fan of his style, but I understand his merit. \n\nTwo points:\n\n-A civil war is unlikely because higher interests than even the president don\u2019t want such disorder on the American political and economic system. I\u2019d like to think people aren\u2019t so blind to ignore warning signs of such radicalization. Moreover, the checks and balances feature of our government would hopefully not allow for such deep-ingrained disruption. However, the president affects the other branches explicitly (via the Supreme Court nominations) and implicitly (via popularizing and leading such radical ideology). \n\n-I understand Carlin\u2019s appeal to giving middle-of-the-road insight, especially when so much of our media is polarizing. However, up until this point, it\u2019s possible that he contributed to false equivalency that in turn silenced much needed alarm bells. For example, he said not to worry after the 2016 election. Perhaps we were right to worry? Clearly Trump has no regard for the laws that make our land unique. We should have been worried. \n\nWhen people try to be in the middle, they just end up equalizing both sides. If something is outwardly, blatantly wrong, it shouldn\u2019t matter if you sound partisan for speaking out against it. Carlin and other moderates should have been more quick to vilify the racist, sexist divider in chief for both his crimes against the people and the division he\u2019s sowed in the process.",

As an outsider without a favourite in the race and with the luxury of not having to choose between two, less than ideal, candidates, I am worried. \nThe way I see it, again from the outside, is that American Congress has been taken out of the game. \nIt is completely paralysed by their own unwillingness to compromise on any topic whatsoever, together with the public perception over the Congress, with the fact that each member is totally entrenched, meaning they\u2019re not willing to vote outside party lines which again turns each of them into pretty much a number and,  with very few exceptions, renders them useless, not to mention that, for so long, their day to day concern was to be re-elected, meaning raising funds by mostly making sure to best serve the lobbyists from where most of those funds came so now they don\u2019t have a frame of thinking about how to best serve their own constituents, people they should protect or guide through this very much troubled times. \nThis will be some of the main arguments leading to the fact that the Congress will not be able to assert its power and it is OUT.\nThe Supreme Court will soon be compromised as well, if not from a legal, judicial viewpoint at least from the public perception. There are two possibilities at the moment, one in which a new judge would be appointed before the election leading to one side ready to go to war, the emotional response to Ginsburg \u2018s death shows it, or the other option would be failing to push through a new judge before the election which will definitely lead to the other side feeling the same impulse, no matter the outcome, the Supreme Court\u2019s authority is compromised and unless they themselves rule as one with unanimous consent the Court is OUT as well. \nThis leaves the office of the President in charge. \nSo at the moment the effective power, all the actual decisions leading the country, belong to that office so in reality the President is already a Dictator, in practical terms no one can overrule his office. \nNext logical steps would be to consolidate and streamline this power, the elections being the ideal opportunity, no matter the results, with no one able, willing or legitimate enough to counter the President, all he needs to do is to declare himself the winner, use the, violent protests that will no doubt follow as an excuse to impose some sort of martial law that would further block the appointment of new Congress members while keeping a semblance of legitimacy by being supported by the GOP senators. \nSo from November on US will be an autocracy, to me this is obvious. \nWill the people rise against it? Yes. Will they be successful? No. \nThe army will intervene massively and quell any protests, attempts to declare states independent and so on. \nWhy? Because the army does follow orders after all, there will be generals quitting, refusing to follow but no American general will lead a force against an American President. Maybe the professional soldiers would refuse to fight against the American people? No, those people would be presented as out of control criminals, the soldiers would be paid extra, executive orders would be issued and be effective laws justifying their actions. \nIn conclusion this is how the American Republic ends, I don\u2019t see any way out of this frame that is not wishful thinking, pragmatic and logical. \nPlease change my mind",

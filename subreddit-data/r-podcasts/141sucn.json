They\u2019re both podcasts I subscribe to but haven\u2019t gotten around to listening to though.\n\nAll of Molly Wood\u2019s \u201cthis week in climate startups\u201d segments were great while she was on this week in startups.\n\nMost of the climate optimism you\u2019ll find these days will be coming from outsider companies raising venture capital for moonshots. Also check out Chris sacca\u2019s stuff with lowercarbon capital. We\u2019re pretty screwed but at least these companies are actually trying stuff even if it probably won\u2019t work.",

So it's got the format of a church service - there's a sermon, and a choir, and the nature facts section is very much like children's time in a mainline protestant church - but it's about environmental activism. A little Gaia/mother Earth personification creeps in, but it's not otherwise religious. But it's not really parody anymore either, it's very sincere.",

    "postText": "I deleted every podcast off of apple podcasts and redownloaded everything a few years back (pre-pandemic) but I\u2019m guessing this show slipped through the cracks. \n\nUnfortunate because the guy hosting was very open minded and a real sweetheart. He would often relate to guests from the perspective of his struggles with depression and mentioned the experience of coming out to his parents as depressed as something he wished he did sooner, his father saying \u201cIf I\u2019d known earlier I could\u2019ve helped so much sooner\u201d or something along the lines. Real \u201cI love my wife\u201d guy too, think he talked about this stuff during a live episode.\n\nThe podcast emphasized having an open mind to different ways of life, identities, and careers. I remember one episode specifically describing a woman\u2019s (or nonbinary, can\u2019t remember) experience having their birthday in a psych ward where they met their fiance.",

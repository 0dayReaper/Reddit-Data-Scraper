The episodes are all funny names so you have to read the little description to find out what each ones about. Some are mental health or music episodes or other hot take episodes. Very good though.",

Some of the stuff he he comes up with is rife with leaps of logic, errors and omissions and he engages in a little bit  amount of magical thinking. He's dead on but I think listeners should know going in that they need to take everything with a teaspoon of salt.",

    "postText": "Does anybody have any recommendations? I was a daily listener to Adam Carolla for many many years. I liked the old school talk radio format condensed to a podcast. He unfortunately is now beyond insufferable. \n\nI just would like to find another lightweight daily updated news/topics show with a comedy lean. Just something to listen to each day to keep me up to speed and get a good laugh. Preferably a show with a group of people. I don\u2019t mind political leanings one way or another. Discussions, Debate, and making fun of the lunacy of it all is why I\u2019m listening.",

It can get serious depending on the news of the day, but they usually end on a more light heartened note. \n\nEvery episode has two co-hosts from a group of four hosts that rotate in and out.",

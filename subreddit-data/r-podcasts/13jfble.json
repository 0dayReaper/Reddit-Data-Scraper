It is one of my favourite podcasts even though I live in the UK and am not directly affected by any of the things they discuss.\n\nIt is very well done (to my tastes, anyway): the right level of journalistic dissection type of reporting and \"wtf is going on??\" genuine distress and bewilderment, as well as some chat that (again, to my tastes) doesn't veer too often away from the topic into pure chat, but I would call their presenting style informal. A good balance of sincerity and irreverence.\n\nBut it isn't straight reporting in the sense OP might mean it, it isn't like a BBC documentary-style show at all. They are quite immersive, and sometimes go to Trump rally- and Q Anon-type events to talk to people there, usually pretending to be one of them (for safety reasons as well as to get people to open up a bit, but I've never heard it get mocking or cruel, the point of it is to try to understand what's going on rather than to make fun of people over their heads so we can all laugh in a superior way at them - that's important to me - though sometimes it's a bit unavoidable, of course). They'll play clips of them talking to people, and then they'll discuss the event in the studio.\n\nThey often interview like-minded (anti Q Anon) people, or are joined by a guest for an episode and that's always interesting. Some of the humour might put people off, there's definitely an edge of hysteria at times (not wacky, look-how-crazy-I-am!! hysteria, actual hysteria) which makes me wonder how much all this must be affecting their mental health - which they sometimes talk about too.\n\nAs you can see, I'm a bit of a fan! I see their show as a public service, I think it should be funded as such, but of course they rely on subscriptions (no advertising or sponsorship on the show), and have a tonne of additional episodes if you subscribe. They provide a much-needed counter argument to the vast quicksand pit of nonsense out there, but it's a drop in the ocean.",

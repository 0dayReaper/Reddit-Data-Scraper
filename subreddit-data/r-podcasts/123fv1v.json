The NoSleep Podcast is the only creepypasta podacast I know of that lists content warnings.",

They were fine but I'm looking for podcasts that actually go into a discussion about the myths instead of dramatizations and summaries. I know there are plenty out there but I'm hoping to narrow them down by getting some suggestions",

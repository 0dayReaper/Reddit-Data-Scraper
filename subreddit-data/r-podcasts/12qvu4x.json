The point of the podcast is to tell crazy addiction stories but also low-key focus on sobriety.\n\nSeems like he's no longer involved, so thanks for the prompt : ) I'm currently listening to the March 31 episode (\"Pushers, Pimps\") and it is what I really like about this podcast. Definitely not for everyone, it's rambling and chaotic but with a lot of insightful nuggets. Taps into the heart of what is my main issue, self-medicating ADHD, but might not resonate for you.\n\nI found out about it from Marc Maron's interview with Keith Wager, episode 1075. You might want to listen to that to see if the sensibility resonates with you.\n\nOther parts of reddit you might want to explore are r/dryalcoholics and r/AddictionMedicine as you put together something that can work for you.\n\nSending good vibes your way.",

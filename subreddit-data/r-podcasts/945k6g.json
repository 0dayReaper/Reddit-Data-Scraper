The real problem is that he encourage violence and defames mass-murdered children, and he claims either that \"it's just an on-air persona\" or \"I sincerely believe it\" (kinda confusing which since his lawyer said one and he said the other), but his followers have committed violent crimes, and courts are deciding what to do about it. \n\nAs an intro example, here's an article:  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/alex-jones-defamation-suit-sandy-hook.html",

Everytime there is something major happening like the boston marathon bomb where it  killed three people and injured approximately 280 others. You will find alex jokes talking about how governement is behind that because this and that and insert in that crisis actor. Its stupid and totally immoral when you know some people were injured for real and died.\n\nWe cant go over the fact that the dude is popular but with this kind of popularity come some responsability. Like it or not, the mainstream media know how to deal with their audience and there is some work behind the news they give. With alex jones its just... Bullshit. He take a news and spin it in a way to ignite his fanbase. he's the one who give credibility to 4chan stupid conspiracy such as Pizza gate and Qanon. He literally legitimise a bunch of 4chan troll who throw shit at the wall until it stick and Alex Jokes take it as a \"credible conspiracy\"\n\nThat being said, there is a crowd for this guy, we cant ignore that and its really sad.\n\n\n\n",

It's perfectly possible to host a podcast on one of the many high-quality hosting services and distribute it via RSS through iTunes and other platforms. Only recently have companies like Spotify, Stitcher and Google come along and created more tightly controlled distribution platforms where creators give up a lot of rights. What *should* be worrying is how easily people sign op for these things without properly realizing what they are giving up. \nStitcher, particularly, also proactively adds podcasts to their catalog. I don't know how they handle rights in those cases, but I wouldn't be surprised at all that Alex Jones' podcast got on Stitcher in this way because of his popularity and reach. Which would make this decision (and your outrage) all the more ironic, even cynical.\nThe removal of a podcast like that of Alex Jones because of hate speech from a tightly controlled platform like Stitcher is perfectly normal and exactly what content creators sign up for.",

Alex Jones is a despicable human being, but one of the great things about podcasting is that there's really no gatekeeper. Anyone can put up an RSS feed that anyone can access. Proprietary systems such as Stitcher and Spotify are threatening that.\n\nIt's mindboggling that people get in bed with them. It's like supporting Comcast or AT&amp;T or whatever even though that there are alternatives (even more popular ones!) that are completely open and belongs to no one and that are *at least* equally good.",

I submitted my RSS feed one time and voila, it\u2019s there. I don\u2019t even think i gets much traffic for us. I login to stitcher like...once a year maybe?",

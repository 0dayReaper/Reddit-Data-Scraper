    "postText": "For those who haven't listened, this podcast is 2 doctors who teach in medical school, explaining in detail part of the anatomy or an anatomical system, and how it functions. Its intended for the layperson. They are largely factual, with the 2 drs occasionally dunking on one another (but not too much). Its heavily educational but super easy to listen to.\n\nIm wondering if anyone knows anything similar, but for another field, like chemistry, physics, or ? I know a bunch of history ones. I know about ologies. There are others that deal with recent research like hidden brain. I'm looking more for foundational knowledge, hosted by pros, and not just \"one and done\" infotainment episodes. \n\nLots of pods are too heavy on the chatter for me, or they focus on a fun bit, not so much about gaining actual foundational knowledge (though I like that type too for sure)\n\nJust thought id throw it out there and see what this great community thinks! and if you haven't heard it, I definitely recommend dr mike and dr matt",

    "postText": "Hi all, trough another poccast I strumbled on this podcast. If you like \u201csomething was wrong\u201d like I do, then you will definitely like this podcast.\nTwo ladies are interviewing women who survived toxic relationships. \nAmber and Athena are the hosts. They shared their story in season 1 &amp; 2.\nTo be honest I started with season 5! (Really good) and I\u2019m now at season 3. \nLike I mentioned if you like Something was wrong\u201d (and I really do), then you will like this one maybe more. \nFirst hand stories from abusive relationships and how they are sometimes similar to the relationships of their parents/households where they are raised). \nIt\u2019s well told, it\u2019s well produced. The hosts are empathetic and they do understand where these ladies are coming from. They\u2019ve been there done that. Almost no morality speeches from the hosts. They are down to earth and not annoying at all.\nThey give you tips how to prevent red flags, how to notice them and much more.\nI live in Europe and I\u2019m not in a abusive relationship and I can\u2019t use their legal tips, but they are very well put together.\n\nAnyway give it a try and if you did already, share your opinion here. I would like to know how you perceived it.",

            "comment": "Thanks I'm really liking this, I feel like I can forgive some of the production as it feels like I just made a podcast and did the best I could.\n\nI can just see these women, they have the list of what they want (tall, fit, handsome, great job) and this guy sells the same checklist to dozens of other women and it all blows up over and over again.\n \n There seems like an entire movement of single women with kids and mediocre jobs who have a list of handsome, strong, tall, good job and they'll accept nothing less and then end up in nightmares.\n\nThese abusers know what some women want. They create movie moments that can be a beautiful story of your love, something you can tell your friends, they are jealous of your love. \n\nThey act like the guy you want, always confident, never needy, always providing, asking nothing, the white knight coming to save you from your life.\n\nThen they turn it off and you can't easily leave, you believe all the fake romance they setup initially, you already told your friends all these things and your pride is on the line, you let him meet your kid and you can't admit that you had poor judgment because it hurts too much to admit you out your kid in this situation.\n\nThen it's the rollercoaster, this guy is especially heinous as he used his partners against each other, saying the other is crazy and you're the only one he truly loves, once again putting your ego on front stage. \n\nLife has movie moments but it's often more clumsy and awkward, white knights exist on tv, men are just as human as women and share a lot of the same feelings. Relationships are a partnership, if someone is taking care of you entirely, watch out.\n\nSometimes they are still judgemental of other women and still think Ben is a decent guy though, it's berserk! One of the women talks about being sick in Italy about her being deathly ill and he's praying over her and saying how he mistreated her and how he will never doing it again and thinks she's sleeping. Of course he knows you'll hear him and they think he is a great caretaker when they're sick because he cares but it's because it creates dependence on him further not because he cares. He is a sociopath and a narcissist, by definition he can't care, he just wants to win and losing you is losing, anything to win is the only goal.\n\nIt's crazy how they can come so far but still not see the forest for the trees. Some other oddities they go on about can be a bit tone deaf like an eyelash extension employee leaving with clients to start her own company and how it was such a betrayal. Lady you're paying her to work for you when she can do the same work herself and keep all the profits, that's not a betrayal, that's just doing the smart thing for herself, lining your pockets is not a friendship quality lol.\n\nThis very much feels like a show where these people will still turn on each other at some point, there is a tension still underneath things just waiting for someone to snap.",

                            "comment": "lol, I did ramble a lot but it is a bit of a mess. These are the 'cool kids' who grew up popular and liked it so much they extend it into adult life. Range Rovers, botique French Bulldogs, strong desire to be taken care of by a man, very into 'love' and the vision of what 'love' should be based on tv and media, watch a lot of Bravo and are catty with their friends but also fairly kind people, just not very complex people, what you see is what you get.\n\nVery strong focus on looks and beauty and fight hard against signs of aging and overdue procedures to look young vs looking a very good version of your age.\n\nSingle moms who have a lot huge lists of check boxes for what they want and being completely unaware that they are a single mom in their 30s with mediocre jobs and have little to offer other than their looks and body and are easy prey for predators who sell a vision of success that they want more than anything.\n\nNo one deserved what they went through. they are decent people, they just aren't my kind of people and kinda help create the messes they find themselves in. Even after all of this, you can tell that they still wanted to be the 'chosen' girl who the guy really wanted and would turn around for.\n\nIt's definitely a bit cringe at times. They make fun of men for their looks, dick sizes, height and don't see the hypocrisy in doing that and would jump on a guy for doing the same to a woman. They just aren't people with a lot of character.",

I can often tune it out but sometimes it\u2019s really distractingly bad \u2014 like the Ana+Ted season where it would switch to Christmas music when they talked about Christmas. \n\nI\u2019ve always found their narrative style to be unique  and kind of hypnotic, I\u2019m impressed how they have translated it to having guests tell their stories.",

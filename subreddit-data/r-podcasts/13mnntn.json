It's a very popular podcast and its two hosts work as political correspondents for NOS and Eenvandaag respectively, so they have a lot of inside knowledge.\n\nI also recommend De Brand in het Landhuis (investigative journalism on the death of an eccentric rich landowner) and Bob (very touching short series about a an old lady suffering from Alzheimer's).",

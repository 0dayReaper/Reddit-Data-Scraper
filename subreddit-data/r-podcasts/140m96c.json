    "postText": "My current podcast app is currently YouTube. However, I find it non-ideal and am looking to find a different app because I find the customized feed and recommendations too distracting.\n\nThe first feature I like about YouTube are the ability to skip to different \"chapters\" of the podcast, which are input by the uploader. The second feature I like about YouTube is the video. By default I listen with no video, but sometimes the podcast puts up a graphic or chart that I'd like to see.\n\nIs there any app that combines these two good features that YouTube has but does not have the distracting feed and recommendations? If it makes any difference, I am on iOS.\n\nThank you and I look forward to reading your suggestions!",

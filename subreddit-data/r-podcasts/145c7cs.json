    "postText": "Howdy. I did search the sub and didn't find any mention of this podcast. I'd like to recommend to you a little podcast called \"Where are You Going?\" from Loftus Media. It just started in March. Episodes are about 8-15 minutes long and come along every four or five days.\n\nI find this podcast so delightful! A lovely British lady named Catherine Carr walks around places and starts short conversations with people by asking them where they're going. Most episodes take place in England, but she occasionally travels. There's at least one episode from New York. Catherine seems kind and sweet, asks good questions that get people talking. Sometimes it's an elderly fellow who seems thrilled to talk about his life. Sometimes it's a businesswoman in a hurry to get to work. Every episode is a little bundle of everyday life. It's amazing to hear the burdensome weights and brilliant joys that people are walking around with.\n\nI hope you'll give it a try.",

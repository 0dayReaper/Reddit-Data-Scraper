Also NZ's Big Fact Hunt (hmm, another not quite rude title, must be a thing) uses a gentle panel show style challenge between friends on a topic.  Both are the relaxing sort of funny",

I mentioned bigfoot, right? Hosted by two Australians. It's funny, ridiculous, crude, and (mostly) self-aware.\n\nI say mostly because one of them drank his own kool-aid a bit during the pandemic and became insufferable on twitter, but if you can ignore that (or better, ignore twitter altogether), the show can be a riot.",

Both hosts are funny and add their own humour into it. It usually starts off with what's going on with them or with current news before it gets into the story but they also have a link so you can just jump straight to the story if you prefer (it took me a while to enjoy the starter stuff but now I do).",

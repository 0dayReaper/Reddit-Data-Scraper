    "postText": "Hi everyone, I've done some searching on my own but I decided to post here to get some more opinions. I'm looking for good comedy or true crime style podcasts (10 hour shifts and I work full-time so I have all the in the world to listen to whatever). I've been really into Small Town Murder for awhile, also Crime in Sports, and a few other scattered ones. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!\n\nI set the post as True Crime flair because you can only select one, but I'm also into the paranormal, or topical comedy, anything that is entertaining and if there are co-hosts, good banter is always appreciated. Thanks in advance",

For weird, I've listened to a lot of audio dramas (not sure if you are asking for fictional and acted out options) but Tanis is by far my favorite with Limetown pretty high up there as well. \n\nDescription of Tanis:\n\nTANIS is a serial podcast set in the same universe as The Black Tapes and RABBITS. Nic Silver - Alex Reagan's producing partner from Black Tapes - misses the days before the internet robbed our lives of mystery. For all that the information age has given us, that sense of mystery, Nic reflects, is something it may have taken away. Following the apparent suicide of a man named Karl van Sant, who posted a mysterious ad on Craigslist advertising himself as a \"Runner,\" Nic begins searching for Tanis, which may be the last great unsolved mystery of our world. What is Tanis? It may be a place. It may be the Holy Grail. It may be a person, or an entity, or a forest spirit, or the Fountain of Youth. It's been called Xanu and Eld Fen. All that's known is that it seems to move around once every four hundred years or so...and it's currently located in the Pacific Northwest, somewhere in the Puget Sound.\n\nDuring the course of his investigation, Nic finds himself targeted by multiple conspiracies and cults, allies himself with a hacker called Meerkatnip, and explores various unsolved mysteries that may or may not be related to the larger question:\n\nWhat is Tanis?\n\n\nLimetown description:\n\nLimetown (2015-present) is a horror/Science Fiction podcast/Radio Drama from Two-Up Productions that began airing during the summer of 2015. It focuses on Lia Haddock, an investigative journalist for APR, in her search for the truth about what happened to the scientific village of Limetown, Tennessee, in which (fictively) in 2005, 347 people vanished without a trace. In fact, Haddock's own uncle, Dr. Emile Haddock, was one of the vanished. The story begins when APR publishes the first episode in Lia Haddock's planned seven-part series focused on what in the world happened in Limetown, which ends in Lia receiving a ground-breaking lead: a survivor, who wants to talk to her. What follows is a dive into a rabbit hole begins to shake Lia's view of herself and the world...",

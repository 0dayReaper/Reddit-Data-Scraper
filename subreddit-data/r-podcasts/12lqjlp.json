As many have said, Lions led by Donkey is very informative but also entertaining and covers soo many topics.Comabt Stories by Ryan Fugit is pretty good. Lots of interviews with plenty of interesting operators.  If you want deep, highly detailed dives then Revolutions by Mike Duncan, WWII by Ray Harris, The Civil War by Richard Youngdahl",

There's also Podcast Radio Hour by the BBC which has finished now, but there's 5 years worth of episodes. Works the same as Podcast Playlist, but with more of a British focus. \n\nI also find podcasts from people mentioning them on Twitter (usually comedians). \n\nThere are SO many podcasts, it's hard to find good independent ones.

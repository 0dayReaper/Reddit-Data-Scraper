If you wanna go cheaper, look at the Anker Soundcore Space Q45.\n\nI've got the XM4s and they're just great, but needed a second pair of ANC headphones on the cheap because my partner and I were doing a lot of flying last Christmas, but I didn't want to spend a lot on headphones that we only planned to use once or twice a year. So I got the Q45 specifically because they allowed for the ANC to remain on while using a wired connection. Anker stuff goes on sale fairly regularly, I got mine for 100 with a coupon.\n\nAre the Q45s great? No not really. But they sound fine, they cost half as much as the Sonys, and the noise cancelling is almost as good.",

I use them to listen to podcasts while working and doing chores around the house, and they quite easily remove the sounds of appliances and dampen (but not remove) the noise of a TV. It's enough that with my podcast or audiobook at low/medium volume, I cannot hear any of the outside world.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the Apple AirPods Pro II or Pro Max are quite capable as well, and also the Sony WH-1000XM5. (The Sony headphones are an excellent product with absolutely horrible name; but I have found them less comfortable than the Bose headphones for extended periods of time.)  \n\n\n(Edit: minor spelling fix.)",

I found them to be comfortable for hours and the sound quality was more than enough for me. And the noise cancellation was better than anything I\u2019d used. \n\nThe AirPods Pro 2 make massive improvements on everything already offered and add some new things like the precision finding. The AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 are some of my favorite products I own. I\u2019ve tried some other headphones in the price range, and I just haven\u2019t been as impressed. I highly recommend AirPods pro, at least if you\u2019re an iPhone user.",

But I had the AirPods Pro I and recently got the II with some credit card reward points. I\u2019m def impressed. I\u2019m a mix engineer by trade and spend a lot of time with molded IEMs. Pretty familiar with good isolation and the AirPods Pro II has it. I find them on par with Max\u2019s NC if not slightly better, though that varies from person to person due to fit/seal.",

Made to be worn hours on end so very comfortabele. The sound is very neutral as they are studio headphones but that actually works very well with voice based audio. They are not active noise canceling but are insulated, so they do dampen sound which helps. I love these over my Sony xm3's when working at home. Only drawback: they are wired.",

After a lot of research I bought a pair of Bose QC Earbuds II a few months ago. They are without a doubt the best earbuds I've ever owned. They're very comfortable, the sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancellation is the best I've experienced. They have multiple noise cancelling modes that can be customized by the user, which I like. The app isn't as good as the Samsung app, which is the best I've used. However, I figure Bose can improve upon the app and the quality of the product more than makes up for an app that's only average.",

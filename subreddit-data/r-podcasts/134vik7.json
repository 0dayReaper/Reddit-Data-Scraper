    "postText": "Not being able to recall where I heard this is driving me nuts!\n\nI think it was a couple of years ago (though the episode itself may be older than that), I heard a story of a guy who had found an ornament of some kind outside his apartment and thought it was cute so brought it home. After that, all kinds of weird things started to happen in his apartment and in his life. I seem to remember he had a girlfriend who was affected by it, too.\n\nDoes this ring any bells? It could have been a Spooked episode, or possibly Radio Rental, but if not those, that kind of vibe.\n\nThank you!",

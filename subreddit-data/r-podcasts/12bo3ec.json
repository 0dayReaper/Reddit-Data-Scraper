    "postText": "This is specifically in regards to Spooked! on Luminary. Seems like all of their 2023 episodes are missing from Apple Podcasts and Spotify. I\u2019ve reported the problem, but haven\u2019t seen any response. Wondering if it\u2019s just me or if someone accidentally deleted their RSS feed? \nI\u2019m a luminary subscriber. \nApple Podcasts shows the most recent episode was updated Friday, but when I attempt to access it, it takes me to last November\u2019s episode. \n\nTroubleshooting: have unfollowed/re-followed the show. \nSent in report ticket to Apple Podcasts \nChecked Spotify to verify and last episode on their playlist is from Nov of 2022\n\nAnyone else having this issue? Are there other ways to report this issue to Luminary that I am not thinking of?",

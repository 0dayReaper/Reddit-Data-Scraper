Great work, you got me hooked again Pj \n\nAn episode a week is a big commitment. Bold. I would love and episode a week, but I don't want to come at the expsese of the host and staffs well being.\nBut I also like to think Pj and the team have been doing this for a while and probably have a good strategy worked out. And the reality is they have bills to pay and a slow trickle of quality journalism isn't always compatible with capitalism/ad revenue. \n\nOh how I wish for an artists utopia. \n\nPut episodes out when you can, and I will be there to listen. No pressure.",

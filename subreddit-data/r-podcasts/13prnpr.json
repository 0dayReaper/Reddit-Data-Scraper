I didn't want to increase the hype as when I first listened to it I was slightly underwhelmed based on how much it was recommended. I think if I'd just heard it in passing, I would have liked it a lot more if that makes sense. So while it's still a really good episode it was just shy of making my favorites",

Why would you separate it as a favorite? I happen to know a lot of others that love it as well, so how would you sell it so that someone else gives it a listen? I don't mean to give you a homework assignment just curious.\n\nI've listened to the Mystery Show episodes and it is a good show, unique and charming. Almost made it to the top. I remember really liking the \"Source Code\" episode as well.\n\nI haven't listened to either of those episodes from This is Love, so I'll definitely check them out. Thank you for the suggestions!",

I just went through some kind of mourning process in this podcast and it made me emotional. At the same time her watching felt unappropriate. I have not listened to other episodes of this podcast actually.  \n\nSomeone posted a list on Spotify named (translated) 'Podcast Gems', The Living Room was on that too.\n\nI'm not from the USA (Dutch) so I guess some podcast episodes are less relatable for me? I'm going to check a few out you mentioned. For example This American Life has so much episodes, I wouldn't know where to start. \n\nYes Mystery Show is really nice and unique. Yeah, that is a good episode too!\n\nOne of my favourite podcasts is The Anthropocene Reviewed, but I couldn't choose a favourite episode.",

The three episodes explore the dark web marketplace known as Silk Road; how it came to be, who was behind it and how it fell. \n* \"The Dropout\" by ABC News is another series I just started listening to that I like so far. It's about Elizabeth Holmes and her company, Theranos. Elizabeth is a girl with potential, and she promises to revolutionize medicine with her groundbreaking blood-testing technology. Everything seems to be going for her from the outside. The podcast tells the full story.\n* \"Sweet Bobby\" by Tortoise Media. Here's some of the description \"Kirat is a successful radio presenter. On Facebook she meets Bobby, a handsome cardiologist. He\u2019s a catch. Soon, they get tangled up in a love affair full of lies and manipulation. Then... Kirat discovers a deception of almost unimaginable proportions...\"\n\nAs far as your problem with the Echo, I think it plays them in order if you say \"Play Show X, episode no. Y.\" Either it would autoplay the next episode or stop at the end of it after which you'd have to prompt it with the next episode number. It's a bit tedious I'd have to admit but I can't think of another solution without fully understanding the problem.",

    "postText": "I know this may be a \"hot take\", but I feel that Smartless only hosts guests that are either their buddies or someone they fanboy over. In that way, I don't feel like they have enough diversity of personality. Sure, we get a look into the lives of certain celebs and public figures, but it would be nice to have someone more obscure on the show.",

I feel it would be more brave for them to actually talk to \"nobodies\", either those lower on the proverbial Hollywood \"ladder\", or just random individuals who do inspiring or amazing things. Would love to hear an interview with an EMT or something. I mean, they interviewed Biden and that other politician lady. I dunno, I just feel like they could elevate the show with some actual variety. I enjoy the show, I think Jason, Sean, and Will are hilarious, plus Bateman is one of my all-time favorite actors.\n\nIf not Smartless, I think Distractible would benefit from, at least, the occasional guest appearance. I mean, they have a platform uniquely primed to bring fellow YouTubers into the spotlight. I enjoy the energy they give off, similar to Smartless, and I identify personally with different aspects of each gent, I just feel like these podcast shows get into a certain niche \"rut\" and never emerge from it. Which is why I tend to listen to creepypasta podcasts and such, since there are at least different authors for each story, shout-out to MrCreepyPasta \u270a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0e",

As for a podcast recommendation, have you checked out Lore or Astonishing Legends? Both have great storytelling and dive into mysterious and supernatural topics. Give them a listen and let me know what you think!",

If you're just looking for creepy/supernatural stories, there's really a lot to choose from and it all depends on what kind of format you like. Single narrator, co-hosts with more of a radio format, hosted shows with different storytellers, and call-in/guest shows are all out there. I tend to enjoy the hosted storytelling format (Radio Rental and Spooked).",

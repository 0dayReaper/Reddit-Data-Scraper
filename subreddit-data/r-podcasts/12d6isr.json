Great writing too, well balanced and explains well but doesn't go too far in depth that it gets boring. \n\nAlthough, if you're not interested in the subject, it would make a perfect podcast to fall asleep too. \ud83d\ude03",

You're evil..... \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd, I see that it's not just Homo Sapiens, also cool.... guess I'll have to see\n\nYou'd think that these days with everyone and their famous brother wanting to do modern topic woo woo podcasts that I'd run out of the History/Old True Crime (sorry New True Crime, but, you're too contemporary and fraught for me)/Science podcasts, and, yet, not even close.... \ud83d\ude02\n\nThank you OP. I'm downloading the first episode now.",

I truly cannot find the appeal, and I am desperately seeking a convincing argument as to how someone could willingly sit through a whole episode. Is it made for 13-year-old boys, and that's why it's so popular? I liked harmontown, I like mbmbam, but not this one, and not this one a lot.\n\nEdit:  if you\u2019re going to write a whole book about how I\u2019m judging these people off of whatever, or how everyone has different tastes, or how maybe I shouldn\u2019t listen, and then proceed to tell me why I should listen, I\u2019m not going read it or respond to it. I\u2019m asking what you like about a terrible podcast because I don\u2019t like it and I want to know why you do. I don\u2019t care about your super scientific explanation of \u201cits chemistry\u201d",

Henry\u2019s screaming was jarring at the start but eventually you come to enjoy it and how Marcus and Ben react to him. Henry says some funny shit sometimes that I\u2019ve snorted out whatever liquid I\u2019m drinking because of how left field it was. He can also be quite insightful (as can Ben and Marcus). I even prefer it over my other staples, MFM and stuff they don\u2019t want you to know because it\u2019s more my sense of humour and often sits between the 2 content wise.\n\nTLDR; give it time, the level of research and group dynamic grows on you.",

Using Blavatsky as an example, they spent the first episode discussing the dry details of her life before she became the weird magician that makes her interesting. The first time I noticed this was during the Mormon series, and it seems like they've sort of leaned into this style of presentation. I tend to skip the first episode in a series these days for that reason - the later episodes still tend to be fun for me",

Henry, IMO, is what really helped bring the show to a wider audience at the conception of the show because he was genuinely quick witted and a great improv comedian.

That's the only time they did anything close to yelling over each other, and even then I feel like that's a bit of an exaggeration in the same vein as an grandma saying an AC/DC song is just yelling and banging around on instruments. Still, Last Podcast's earliest stuff was by far the roughest, since the hosts themselves have said they had no idea what the hell they were doing back then. \n\nAnd since then, they've been constantly improving on themselves. They do an impressive amount of research even if the topic is something stupid like flat earth, and I love the personality and humor of the boys. They just have a great chemistry, and it makes for me an endlessly entertaining podcast that I can listen to again and again withiut getting tired of.",

They truly are great at that. \n\nFor cults there\u2019s Zealot. The host is a little silly and it\u2019s a pretty small podcast. She does goofy songs and jokes sometimes, but it\u2019s a lot more to the point. It\u2019s just her and a guest there is a little banter and off topic discussion, but way less than MFM and LPOTL and she has a nice Australian accent. Some episodes are better than others, but I enjoy it.\n\nBox of Oddities is good for the most part. The hosts are lovable and not as loud. They do banter, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. The only downside is that you have no idea what kind of topics they\u2019re going to cover. It\u2019s all really random and sometimes one half of the show is good and one half is a little boring.",

I appreciate their willingness to tell the story and the way they do so.\n\nPodcasts that don\u2019t bother to do the research and spend half the show \u201cbantering\u201d or talking about their personal lives while calling themselves true crime is something that rubs me the wrong way, so I enjoy them!",

I almost immediately fell in love with the show and some people are slower to catch on.\n\nThe amount of research Marcus does at the expense of his mental health (in the earlier episodes) is fantastic. He's an advocate for mental health care and they cast fairly frequently tells people to seek help if they think they might need it. He truly is a legend of research. I can't imagine how many hours he's spent with his nose buries in reading material just for the show. He makes a huge stack of notes for every episode and has an outline for everything.\n\nHenry is somebody you either love or hate. He was in a CollegeHumor skit way back in the day. He's been in some movies and TV shows too. His sense of humor is super dark and super dirty. He's hyper animated in all things. He's crazy about his alien theories too. Oh he's also a legitimate Satanist and is proud of it, as he should be.\n\nBen is the voice of reason if there was one for the show. He plays the skeptic because he truly is for some of these stories. I used to think he was legitimately stupid compared to these two, but then I realized it was because he was pretending to be the average person who doesn't know shit about these subjects. He's not as consistently funny as Henry, but he slips a few zingers in there from time to time.",

I found them really annoying and didn\u2019t enjoy the humor but also walked away from every episode retaining a lot of the information Marcus provides. I don\u2019t listen to them anymore but have gone back to listen to episodes about specific killers/cases I want to learn more about. I think Henry is almost unbearable to listen to and I cringe every time he starts a bit and Marcus is struggling to get back to the episode. If I had it my way it would be Marcus explaining the research to a friend.",

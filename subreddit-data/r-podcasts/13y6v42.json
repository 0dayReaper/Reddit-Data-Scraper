    "postText": "Hi so I just remembered an amazing podcast that i listened to a few years ago, but can't seem to remember the name.\n\nIt's structured as a history/investigative podcast with season long arcs of made up stories. I remember the last season was about some old time Hollywood movie that got scrapped before its release. Something mafia-like, a murder in a movie theater etc. \n\nFemale presenter, really good production as far as I remember, the thumbnail something red.\n\nPlease help me, I really want to see if they have released something new or just rehear the old stuff!",

    "postText": "I am a rather anxious bean, and I need to improve my mental hygiene. I\u2019m looking for a good, calm podcast to practice daily meditations or just better mental health habits. I really enjoy On Being, to give a sense of the vibe I like. I\u2019m not looking for any long interviews, just a quick 10-15 episode I can listen to in the morning/on my way to work, etc. Something to get the mind right! (I\u2019d also be okay with funny ones, too!) \n\nThank you so much!",

    "postText": "Years ago I found a podcast that did research on a family myth, secret or history to discover if it was true or the whole story. I sent them a suggestion and they responded that they would be interested if they got a second season. They didn't. I believe they use newspaper clippings, obits, census etc.\n\nLSS: Had a relative that played semi-pro ball (barnstorming), was a drinking buddy (maybe teammate) with Ty Cobb and when he was dying of a bad liver, Satchel Paige came to his small central PA town to visit him. He worked the railroad off season.\n\nAre there any podcasts like that today?",

    "postText": "EDIT TO ADD:\nI found it! It is called The Podcast of Doom (search it as podcastofdoom if interested). The host ended ir in January of 2019, but looks like he came back to do a couple episodes on COVID. Thank you for all of your suggestions and I will be sure to look into new podcast recommendations!!\n\nI used to listen to a podcast that discussed all kinds of disasters from tsunamis to train derailment and beyond. I know there are no new episodes being released, but I was going to see if I could find a past episode to relisten to but I can't remember the name of it to save my life.\n\nThere was a single host. The opening theme was \"this is the end, beautiful friend. This is the end\" (edit: \"The End\" by The Doors) and he ended every episode with something like \"keep your ears pinned and your tail tucked.\"\n\nAnyone have a guess?",

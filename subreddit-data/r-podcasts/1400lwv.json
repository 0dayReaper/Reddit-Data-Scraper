It tells the story of the British Mandate of Palestine through the eyes of a Jewish woman and an Arab man.  I thought it was pretty balanced overall.  There were a couple times I felt it glossed over some of the less savory things the Arabs did, but on the whole I was pretty even handed.  If anything, it places the blame for the conflict not on the Jews or Arabs, but on the British for not doing more to mediate the conflict.  I did a review of Miriam and Youssef on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-audio-file-miriam-and-youssef.html?m=1",

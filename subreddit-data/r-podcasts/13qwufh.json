    "postText": "Hello since i am currently studying philosophy and i am interested by it, i want to know some nice podcasts to study philosophy. I am mostly interested in classical philosophers and the history of philosophy itself, since it seem easier to use in study and seem less complicated to use and to remember. \n\nAlso since i am pretty sensible, i hope to find if possible podcasts, that are not too heavy handed in their topic, with maybe not many references to current event, or grave events. I kinda prefer old podcasts to news one, since they don't make references to currents events, and most time the current even they talk about, are too far in time, to bother me.",

    "postText": "I love the Why Files and have watched almost all of them. I really love the ufo, aliens, alternative history, time travel, etc.\nI\u2019ve not been able to find another podcast / show that really gets to the point like he does in his episodes. He basically gives you an in depth overview of all of the information and people involved then at the end gives some info about why it could / could not be real.\nIs there anything out there as good as or better than the why files?\nI\u2019ve watched / listened to The lore lodge, ufo rabbit hole, weaponized, coast to coast new version with George Knapp, and a few others but nothing grabs me like the Why Files.\n\nWhat do you guys have / recommend?",

Belief Hole and Into the Portal are some real fun ones that don't get recommended enough. Stuff They Don't want You to Know and the Parcast Conspiracy Theories shows are both really good too. Cryptonaught and Monster Talk are good for more cryptid oriented ones, and of course Sasquatch Chronicles. Lore is a classic as well, his Bennington Triangle ep is great. \n\nI just recently got into The Why Files, the weird way he sits down at the start of each episode just kills me.",

    "postText": "I listened to a spooky podcast a couple years ago that was an elaborate fictional story that spanned across 9 or 10 episodes (maybe more or less). I don\u2019t remember what the exact storyline or even premise was, but I remember it had characters that were traveling in cars communicating with each other, driving through a creepy town, running into trouble on the road, etc. I know this is so super vague but if anyone could help I would love to listen to it again!!!!",

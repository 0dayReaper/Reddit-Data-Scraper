    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am trying to get back into reading and one of the things I miss most about school is being able to discuss the book while reading. I was wondering if there are any podcast suggestions where the idea would be to read a few chapters of the book, listen to an episode that discusses those chapters, repeat. I am a huge fan of fantasy books so if there are any specific to that genre, I would love to know. Thanks!",

However, they're about taking the piss out of what they're reading and mocking it...I doubt it's what you're looking for (and they cover more than sci-fi/fantasy). \n\nFull disclosure, I started my own book podcast and I attempted to follow a read-along format. But without any kind of pre-existing following it's like speaking into the void, so I just turned it into a straight review podcast. \n\nI think that may be a reason why there aren't many (that I know of) - it's hard to gain traction if you're not already \"known\", and there's a lot of hard work to get out there.",

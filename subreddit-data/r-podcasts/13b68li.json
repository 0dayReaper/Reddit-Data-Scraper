In Bear Brook they start with the minutiae of people knocking over random barrels and shrugging and moving on with their lives. They even use words like stalled and torpor to describe all of the years/decades of literally nothing happening.",

The case he discussed had so much potential to be great but the narration was awful. However, I have started season 2 (on episode 3) and while the narration is still lacking (slightly better than season 1), the case is intriguing. I don't know what it is with potential wrongful convictions but they seem to draw people in.",

It\u2019s about former vice president Spiro Agnew\u2019s crazy bribery scandal that a lot of people don\u2019t know about because it came out around the same time as watergate. It is so well hosted and the special guests are a group of lawyers who were the key players in discovering the bribery trail. At the time they lawyers were super young and fresh lawyers and accidentally stumbled upon the wildest case and now they are interviewed as elderly men who are still so passionate about the work they did and still get choked up talking about it. It\u2019s so wholesome and I love them. \n\nI\u2019m not the type of personal who would generally listen to a politically driven podcast but it is very much true crime meets politics in a very digestible and well explained way. Could not recommend this podcast enough.",

Talk about tying every single thing together in a case! They really hit it out of the park with Season 2, just listen to that instead.",

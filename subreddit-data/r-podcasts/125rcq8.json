    "postText": "Exactly what the title says....I just finished the series (8 episodes) five minutes ago and had to jump on here to give it a huge thumbs up. \n\nThe center of the story, JJ, is captivating, smart, and his character as a human touches you to the core. I wanted to give JJ's mom a giant hug and I championed his sons. Dan Slepian did a FANTASTIC job telling the story and investigating and the relationship formed between JJ and Dan brings you to tears. Lastly, this story definitely makes you want to learn more and do more about prison reform and our justice system.\n\nListen!",

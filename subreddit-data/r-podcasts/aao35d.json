    "postText": "I see a lot of people on here promoting their own podcast and I try to give as many of them a listen as possible. Occasionally I'll find well-thought-out and well-produced podcast but the vast majority are not great for one of two reasons; number one is that the podcast is themed around an already saturated topic such as nerd and geek culture and there being absolutely no distinguishing features about your nerd and geek culture podcast versus the rest of them. \n\nThe second one that irks me the most is complete disregard for the podcast audience. What I mean by that is feeling like you and four of your buddies can just hop on the mic and shoot the shit while everything is translating well to an audience that is just hearing you for perhaps the first time and knows nothing about you and your inside jokes with your friends. Almost nobody wants to hear a 35-minute story about what you were doing before you got to the recording location. \n\nPlease, for the love of God, try to avoid physical comedy in your podcast. That's actually happened a few times where somebody is doing something that is making everybody in the studio die of laughter for and for four or five seconds the audience is wondering what is going on until somebody, in between bouts of laughter, tries to explain what is going on in the studio. \n\nTry to avoid \"you had to be there\" stories too. Please. I understand that humor is completely subjective but please try to remember that are there people who don't know you or your friends and are not in the studio with you are going to be consuming your podcast. For the love of God, take your audience into consideration. ",

I just put up an attempt to listen to the latest episode of your insufferably terrible podcast and it's all making sense now why this post seemed to have struck a nerve with you. \n\nWithin the first 10 minutes (which is all I could stand and turned it off after that) you have \"funny\" voices, incredibly boring stories, dick jokes, poop jokes, stories about weed and getting blackout drunk, people dying laughing hard into the mic at every mildly amusing comment (at best), and calling each other homophobic names. Your podcast fucking sucks and I now see why you're getting all pissy about my post; it's because it's basically describing exactly what your podcast is. it's funny how my post was just a conglomeration of all the terrible podcasts that I have heard and I didn't have any one particular podcast in mind that checked off all the boxes on my undesirable list. However, yours seems to do the trick. \n\nHere's a nickel's worth of advice: maybe try renaming your show to \"I'm a sixteen-year-old boy and just went to my first house party\". You have truth in advertising and you might attract an audience of frat boy wannabes to your show since that seems to be the demographic that you guys are all in. ",

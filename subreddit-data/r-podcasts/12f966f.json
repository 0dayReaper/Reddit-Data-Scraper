    "postText": "I have (roughly) an hour a night to listen to uninterrupted audio and I'm becoming frustrated looking for podcast series where the episodes can fit neatly into hour-long chunks. Like, one hour-long episode or two half-hour episodes would be perfect. But even scripted podcasts can have one episode 50 minutes long, the next 17 minutes and the one after that 55 minutes. Know what I mean?\n\nRadio shows are good for keeping to time, but when you search for good radio shows, you get lists which include stuff like Desert Island Discs which has thousands of episodes and is still generating new content. I'd prefer to enter into something that I know has a conclusion.\n\nI don't mind genre or style, as long as its decent quality and fits the above criteria. The \"hour\" limit is like, give or take ten to fifteen minutes, but around an hour would be great (or, as mentioned, I could do two half hour episodes a night).",

Almost all are well narrated and hold your attention if you like the genre.",

I don't want to listen to something all the way through, then stop at an arbitrary point and have to wait for new episodes to come out.\n\nThe way that I listen to shows, say, for example its an hour long program, is one episode a night, every night, uninterrupted from start to finish. If there are 24 episodes, it would take 24 consecutive nights to listen to. Shows build their own rhythm when you listen to them this way and its really satisfying and entertaining to me to do it that way.",

I think that it is meant kindly, but I wanted to say something because it was so relentless, and you were so clear!\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you responded because it reminded me that I got halfway through looking for podcasts that fit your requirements, then completely forgot all about it.\n\nI didn't realise how varied in length most podcast episodes are until I tried to find one that has episodes the same length. None of the podcasts I am subscribed to fit your criteria, but most podcast shows that have ended I have already unsubscribed to, and unfortunately I have an awful memory, so I have no idea what they were.\n\nBut your comment about Desert Island Discs gave me an idea, so I was looking for BBC radio programmes that have ended, but where the podcast archives are still available. This turns out to be perfect! When the BBC provide podcasts of old radio shows that haven't been edited, episodes are exactly the same length. I live in the UK and have been a lifelong, if sporadic, listener to BBC Radio 4, so I know some radio shows to look for.\n\nI have found a couple, but got distracted and didn't finish looking. **Do you have any suggestions for subject matter?** That might trigger my memory of past shows that might have podcasts. For some reason I can't figure out, the BBC website doesn't seem to have a section on completed shows, so even when I found a podcast, when I looked on the BBC website to confirm the show is definitely finished, the dedicated pages for that show don't say, so it takes longer to confirm. Otherwise I would suggest looking on their website to find defunct shows then search for the related podcast. But the info isn't there (that I could see).\n\n(Sorry this has turned into such a long and rambling reply, and I probably seem weirdly dedicated to helping you find what you want. Your request has switched some lights on in my non-typical brain, so now even if you no longer wanted suggestions I'm going to have to find some. So I may as well post them here when I'm done!)",

It is an old BBC radio programme that was very popular and highly acclaimed, and is available as a podcast. \n\nIt was called \"A History of the World in 100 Objects\", a self contained series of 100 episodes (as the name suggests), that ran in 2010. Each episode is 14 minutes long, and you can get those as individual podcasts on podcast apps (it's on Apple podcasts, Overcast and Pocket Casts at least). \n\nBBC description: \"Director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, narrates 100 programmes that retell humanity's history through the objects we have made.\"\n\nThe BBC have compiled those into 20 omnibus edition podcasts that are each exactly an hour long! (Well, most are 60 minutes, some are 57 or 58 minutes). Perfect! Except I'm not sure you can download those via a podcast app, the BBC is on a mission currently to make all BBC radio available only via their \"BBC Sounds\" app, which is a pain in the arse, so this might be one of those situations. But it's here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/series/b00nrtf5\n\nI'll post more as I find them...\n\n(Edit: added podcast description)",

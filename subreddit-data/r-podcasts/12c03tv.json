    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm looking for a podcast which covers all aspects of psychology, something straight to the point and practical, so yeah maybe a little of philosophy but not too much or even anything at all.\n\nSomething practical, with suggestions you can apply in real life.\n\nI've already studied the personality disorders like narcissism, borderline, etc etc, and I read about them a lot but I'd now like a podcast which covers each one of them in a separate episode to listen while I'm cooking.\n\nI've found many of them on the internet, my question is: which one is the more practical and straight to the point? So no small talk, practical advices to apply in the real life about for example dealing with a narcissist or other things like that\n\nThanks everyone!",

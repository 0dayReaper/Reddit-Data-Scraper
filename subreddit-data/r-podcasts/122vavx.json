    "postText": "Hey all, back with another podcast request! \n\nNow\u2026I do not watch pro wrestling. But, after listening to a couple of podcasts (and Beat the Champ tbh), I\u2019ve been growing a fascination for pro wrestling as an act and art. Two episodes in particular are Radiolab\u2019s \u201cLa Mancha Screwjob\u201d and today\u2019s The Daily: Sunday Read on Danhausen.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious: are there any pods out there about pro wrestling? I\u2019m not interested in interviews or sportscaster-style so much, more about history and storytelling? Thank you so much!!\n\n(Edit: spelling!)",

I listen to the odd episode here and there if it\u2019s about a wrestler I like but there\u2019s episodes about Vince Mc Mahon, Eric Bischoff, and Paul Heyman which will delve more into the behind the scenes stuff.  The main host can be a bit full on and I can only manage an episode before having to take a break for a while but you might find him more bearable.",

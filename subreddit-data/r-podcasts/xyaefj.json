    "postText": "Very interesting stat via [this Gimlet Union tweet](https://twitter.com/GimletUnion/status/1578480649241260032). Here's the text, for those who don't use Twitter. The third paragraph is especially interesting.\n\n&gt; Yesterday, Spotify blindsided both Gimlet Union and Parcast Union with at least 38 layoffs across their studios. Spotify has said in the press that these layoffs constitute less than 5% of people working on original podcasts. That number is misleading. The reality is that each bargaining unit, organized with the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), has lost about 30% of its members. These aren't small cuts, they are massive restructurings\n&gt; \n&gt; Each shop has lost seasoned producers, writers, and editors. Many of those laid off were longtime employees - people who helped build our studios from the ground up, and who saw them through a global pandemic. Some were on parental leave. Others were in the middle of relocating. These employees left other jobs, other cities - other countries - to work at a company that told them repeatedly that their jobs would be secure. Most egregious is that in Parcast's case, these layoffs directly impacted the majority of members in the union's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Committee, as well as the majority of the former organizing and bargaining committees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yesterday Spotify told show teams that their podcasts were being canceled because of low numbers. But decisions Spotify leadership made directly contributed to those low numbers. Their decision to make most of Gimlet's and Parcast's shows Spotify exclusive caused a steep drop in listeners - as high as three quarters of the audience for some shows. Yet the company did little or nothing to staunch the bleeding. Shows languished without marketing support, and teams were not given clear audience goals to meet The strongest indication these employees received that their shows were not meeting Spotify's goals was when they were laid off yesterday. To contribute to the confusion, some of the employees who were laid off were working on popular shows, suggesting the cuts weren't solely due to the reach and success of those programs. And yet, Spotify has failed to give any explanation for how they evaluated who would be let go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spotify gave employees as little as an hour to close out their work, even though they needed to collect sources, tell guests that episodes weren't airing, file expenses, download personal paperwork including paystubs, and finish putting out episodes. Spotify subscribers expecting to hear their favorite shows have been left in the lurch, with no explanation, The fact that Spotify chose to handle these cuts in this way shows their disregard for both their employees and their audience.\n&gt; \n&gt; It didn't have to be this way. And Spotify can still take steps to help laid-off employees. It can start by allowing them to take their contacts, sources, and unfinished work with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yesterday, Spotify chose to create chaos instead of treating employees with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nI really don't understand how or why Spotify so badly mismanaged their entry into podcasting. I feel very bad for the people who lost their jobs, but I'm glad that Spotify's attempt to move podcasting away from an open format is not succeeding.",

Why would I want to use a second app, that adds more ads if I don't want to subscribe?  Just the fact that Spotify made them exclusive made me not want to use it.",

For the most part it means the medium remains open, with extras and bonuses for subscribers, and I like that if someone does subscribe, they're subscribing directly to the studio/network making the shows, not to a middle man distributor (less Apple's cut.)",

They made poor choices and these are the consequences. They have a chance to fire Rogan and reverse the exclusivity, but it looks like they are going to point fingers at the shows instead.",

Yes, some shows themselves may have their own paywall, but even those generally still let you use your app of choice. I don't want to and won't switch apps for specific shows. Especially for a medium I mostly consume in the car and don't have the brainspace to try to remember which app has which podcast on it.

Tools like Apple's channels allow networks to run subscriptions that allow you to access extras across multiple shows (rather than paying directly to one show) and kind of feels more like a podcasting Netflix.\n\nHowever, the barrier to entry remains amazingly low which means you're often supporting small companies or teams whose content you love.\n\nI also think it has the potential to help diversify output a little. A show might get a decent following but not grow enough through something like Patreon to be sustainable, but if it's one of several shows available on a joint subscription, it may survive where otherwise it would be cancelled, kind of like in old Hollywood when otherwise unsustainable B-movies were kept afloat by the headliners they were attached to.\n\n(Rant over, I'll stop now \ud83d\ude02)",

The future is the 16-30yo demo and that demo is incredibly loyal to closed systems and especially to Spotify because they've grown up with it. They don't even understand, as creators, why the heck they would need an RSS feed to chase listens \"everywhere\" and the listeners don't even know what a podcast listening app is because why would they use anything but Spotify?\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nMy podcast crossed 1M downloads since it started this January (2022), and I didn't market it (save one one-week facebook campaign and one one-week digital billboard campaign which, collectively, netted me about 200 new listeners). 94% of its listenership is on Spotify and guess what? 70% of the demo is 17-30.\n\n**Spotify hasn't mismanaged anything**, they're well ahead of the curve and they're going to win the game as a result.\n\nThe current *\"If it's not RSS it's not a podcast\"* crew is inconsequential to Spotify, they're going to phase out within the next decade, they don't matter any more to the ongoing evolution of podcasting; they are already vestigial in most ways and they hold up progress in the medium from a marketing and growth perspective.\n\nSpotify's eye is on the TikTok generation, because that's what's already shaping the future. They're not building for today or yesterday, they're building for 2030. All of its decisions are made with this in mind. They hire quickly, fire quickly, acquire quickly, dissolve quickly -- they are incredibly nimble for such a giant operation -- they aren't afraid of making mistakes or bad press, and that's why, regardless of the media hits on them, their stakeholders still trust them.\n\nThey've got a big, long-term vision that kills podcasting as we know it today, and you can argue the downside of that all day long... but you can't suggest they don't know what they're doing.\n\nSpotify knows exactly what it's doing.\n\nFor context: my insights here don't come as an outsider. As an advisor to Podz (which Spotify acquired) I've seen some of that first hand. As an ex-studio owner who has worked with Spotify talent, I've seen some of that first hand. As a podcast creator since 2010, I know the medium from all \"creator angles.\" And as a (now retired) marketing consultant in podcasting, I know what new podcasters want most: growth--not multi-channel distribution or stitched-together 3rd party quasi-solutions to growth--ACTUAL GROWTH. Spotify can provide that, so that's where the future is headed. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

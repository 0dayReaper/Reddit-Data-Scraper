Wanted to hear much more about the upbringing of Warhead. I always think \u201chow did this happen to begin with?\u201d After the initial shock of the depravity. As an example of what I\u2019m looking for, thanks!",

I understand he pled out, so there aren\u2019t any trial transcripts or publicly available mitigation documents \u2014 I don\u2019t think. My hunch is someone somewhere probably would have covered him if there were any facts not covered by Hunting Warhead but I\u2019m not seeing anything. But I\u2019m definitely not an expert on that case and can\u2019t say for sure nothing like that exists.",

    "postText": "at first i really really enjoyed this podcast. but recently when i listen i stop halfway through the episode. i halfway listened all the way through the most recent episode bc i like spencer, the guest. morgan is just so different than the beginning. she claims to know a bunch of OT things that aren\u2019t actually true. (i\u2019m an OTA)\u2026. part of our code of ethics for Occupational Therapy is Altruism and she didn\u2019t even know what altruism meant in a recent episode\u2026.and she ALWAYS \u201cknows someone\u201d. in the most recent episode with spencer hunt she said \u201ci actually know someone who\u2026\u201d and related to a story some how. and said \u201ci actually have a friend who\u2019s friends with kelly clarkson\u201d like she ALWAYS \u201cknows someone\u201d. idk i just feel like she portrayed herself differently in the beginning and she\u2019s actually so ditzy and not as knowledgeable about things as she thinks she is. does anyone else feel this way?",

            "comment": "I used to listen too, and my partner still does, but getting through an episode now is hard for me. They\u2019re fairly long but the actual conversations themselves don\u2019t really have much substance? Like the last episode i listened to, I think I was nearly 45 minutes in by the time they\u2019d finished restating the same take about the first story. \n\nMorgan\u2019s a good storyteller, but I\u2019ve grown less fond of her takes and personal anecdotes. Alejandra\u2019s too. I don\u2019t think she ever actually worked as an OT either, I think she graduated and couldn\u2019t find a job as she stated on an episode? Lots of pseudosciencey discussions and cringy tiktok quotes. After all that I decided it wasn\u2019t for me and just stopped listening. Lauren is easily my favorite co-host though, would\nlisten to her on her own podcast \n\nI\u2019d suggest Reddit on Wiki if you\u2019re interested in something similar!",

            "comment": "Never noticed that she always knows someone but she definitely portrays herself as knowing \"so many random facts\" when half of the things she says are wrong.\nI'm not an OT so can't comment on that but have some background in medicine and physical sciences and she has said so many things in the past with so much confidence, even lecturing her friends over it, when what she was saying was completely inaccurate. So frustrating!\n\nI also feel like a lot of her takes lack both nuance and consistency, and some of the takes are becoming hot for all the wrong reasons. Which is a shame, cause I also liked it a lot at first.",

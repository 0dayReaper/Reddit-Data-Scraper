By regularly extending out all episodes to audio book length, Dan\u2019s giving fuller and more complete treatment. But he\u2019s also indulging in a lot of only semi-on-topic musings and repeats himself a lot more than he used to. I wish he were doing more \u201cblitz\u201d episodes.\n\nRegardless of kibitzing though, it\u2019s always great to get new material from Dan.",

I was able to re-download it from my Pocket Casts app just a bit ago.\n\nI listened to those particular episodes just after my daughter was born a couple years ago. They were great, but I was pretty sure I'd missed some stuff due to general life stress. I'd been meaning to go back and give them a listen -- but to give myself more context I'd been working my way through a bunch of books about WW1 first. *The Guns of August, The Great War and Modern Memory* and of course, Winston Churchill's multi-volume *The World Crisis*.\n\nSo I kinda freaked out when I thought the old ones would be gone. I'm really glad you gave us all the heads up so I could still grab them.",

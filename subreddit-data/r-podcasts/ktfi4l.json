'ZOK' catgeory - those that were OK but due to my list of subs it wasn't worth my tirme to finish listening to them. 'ZDONE'  catgeory for those I finished.\n\nThe podcast in the categories starting with 'Z.. ' have their name renamed to be the Category + Poecast name. The ZCategoryName gets them to the bottom of my list and reminds me no to listen or sub to them again.\n\nThis is why I love Podcast Addict and paid for it.",

I've developed pods I listen to every week, ones I might listen to a few times a month, and others that I only listen to rarely when the guest or topic is interesting.  I think I still have a few that I'm subscribed to that sounded interesting but I've never even listened to an episode.  I just have my app only download on wifi and only keep the most recent few episodes of anything.  It works for me but I understand everybody's brain is different and I've been told my way is anxiety inducing for some who must start at the beginning and always listen to everything.",

    "postText": "I know this is a random blast from the past, but every once in a while I wonder to myself \"Whatever happened to Joe d'Eon, host of the Fly With Me podcast?\" Maybe some knowledgeable redditors can clue me in. \n\nThe podcast ended abruptly in May 2010 with no explanation from Joe. I've always been curious what happened there. He did a live podcast on April 29, posted on May 10, and was planning to do another on May 13 with details of the upcoming podcast, guest etc., in the [show notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20120101145449/http://joepodcaster.libsyn.com/), but that was the last his audience ever heard from him. \n\nAt the same time he stopped posting on twitter and no more pictures appeared on his flickr account. I haven't found an obituary in my googling. I wonder if he fell ill suddenly or just rage quit for some reason. He wasn't especially old in 2010, probably around 48 years old. Does anyone have any clue what happened to Joe?",

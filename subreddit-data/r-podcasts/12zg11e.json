Any suggestions?\n\nHere are my other favorite ones that fit that bill: Into It, ICYMI, Adulting, Normal Gossip, Maintenance Phase",

And they have a bit at the end called criminal or minimal that's fun. \n\nCanceled is an Australian podcast where they put celebrities \"on trail\" for their behavior. It's very light and it's fun to hear them rehash bad celeb antics I've forgotten about\n\nEdit: autocorrect bs",

    "postText": "I've been searching for podcasts similar to Dropped Frames, Friends Per Second, Alanahs Pearce several podcasts, Kinda Funny, Rooster Teeth, and ACG \n\nThough I enjoy Alanahs Podcasts they've seem to have lost the consistency, often only have two people, so its only a duel podcast which loses what I mainly look for, which is perspective from a mulititude of different people who play different games similar to Dropped Frames, ranging from triple A to indie. Similarly Kinda Funny usually focuses on a specific game, almost reviewing the game and as some one who partakes in r/patientgamers I almost never play new games so its usually not for me. ACG doesn't really have a schedule so its not really something to consistently listen to. \n\nAny suggestions on gaming podcasts, preferably not console focused like X Cast or PS I Love You, but more varied with different personalities?",

Are you interested in a conversation around the week's video game news, or just people talking about what they're playing?\n\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of the Kinda Funny stuff, but yes \u2014\u00a0on Gamecast they often do deep dives on the one game they've played for review. Game Daily is appointment listening for me though. Otherwise, it's pretty piecemeal across their other content. I quite like their discussion about the games they play on their livestreams.\n\nIGN's Game Scoop used to be really good, but admittedly I haven't listened to that in a little while. Damon Hatfield has long been the host though, and I rate him a good deal.",

If you've ever watched their podcast, I think they have the ideal setup of having a new portion that they quickly cover and then talk about the half dozen games they've been playing, putting up gameplay and having discussions on them.",

Lots of other content from them in YouTube if you end up liking them. I also enjoy Triple Click, Waypoint, and Easy Allies.",

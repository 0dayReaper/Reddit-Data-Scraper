If I can't hear what's being said by person A without having to crank it so loud person B causes hearing loss, you've sort of removed the option of your podcast being listened to no matter how much I think I will like the content.  This is a fairly common issue, sometimes on podcasts that have been around for years.",

We pay you for your content, and we want you to produce more! not say a list of names at the end of every episode. \n\nI know you producers out there might disagree, you might say shout outs are a good incentive to donate. You got to kiss investors asses, I am well aware. I do it at my job all the time.\n\n Mostly it bugs me because I always stop the episode close to the end to skip the shout outs, and my podcast app, Stitcher, marks it as half finished, so I go back and think \"hey I didn't finish this episode! yayy more LPOTL!\" Then I hit play and its just Henry's voice: \" Ashley Sampson, John Fitzgerald, Thomas Fink, Luke \"the Nugget\" Chesterton...\"  ",

They\u2019re trying to get in as many sentences as possible in a short amount of time. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like reading a book to a kid. You try to plan what you\u2019re reading to allow for dramatic pauses or shorter thoughts so they can enjoy and understand the book, even if they can\u2019t read it. \n\nSo when you\u2019re telling someone information they haven\u2019t already heard (like on a podcast or in a presentation) you plan to pause at certain points so it\u2019s easier for someone to follow since they don\u2019t have the script or reading material in front of them. \n\nWhen you know how you\u2019ll tell the story, you know when to take the breath. And then do it in a way that doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re drowning. Most people who make noise when they breathe into the mic really aren\u2019t that grading to hear, but if you\u2019re gasping because you didn\u2019t plan your breaths, slow it down. \n\nHope that helps!

There are of course tolerances, but I've listened to a few that started having loud fire-alarm style beeping in them. Turn down the beeping, can't hear anything else. Audiences are smart enough to understand \"this sound is loud\" without making it painful. \n\n2) The hosts laughing for long periods of time. There's so many podcasts that seem to be 50% content, 20% adds, and 30% the hosts loudly laughing. I get it, you're funny, but consider a podcast a stage. A chuckle now and then it great and human but nonstop laughing is horrible.\n\n3) Mumbling. I tried to get into a podcast that was mostly a fairly marginalized group of people talking about their daily experiences. But, half the show was one host mumbling so low that you could not make out what he said. I skipped to a few others, same stuff. Noped right out of there.\n\n4) Racist, sexist jokes. In any context. If a show has like a million issue back catalogue and they got better (looking at you Flop House) I'll go look for reviews. But if you're recording in 2018 and the best you can do is say lolol we sure triggered them!!1!!1 you aren't worth the listen.\n\n",

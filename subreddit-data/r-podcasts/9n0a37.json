    "postText": "\"So my answer to your question is, I *do* like it...\"\n\n  \"MM-HMM...\"\n\n\"...when this kind of thing comes up, because it's GOOD,\"\n\n  \"Yep!\"\n\n\"...when people think about this sort of thing. And we do need that,\"\n\n  \"Right!\"\n\n\"...if we're going to get to the same goal\u2014\"\n\n  \"Of course!\"\n\n\"that we're heading towards, and ultimately that's, I think, a reasonable thing\"\n\n  \"Definitely.\"\n\n\"\u2014to want to do. I think that goes without saying.\"\n\n  \"Sure.\"\n\nThese little verbal confirmations are unnecessary and EXTREMELY DISTRACTING. You can tell within about 10 seconds whether a podcaster is a good/seasoned interviewer or they've never interviewed a person in their life.\n\nLook, I get it. We all have verbal tics. And it's very tempting to verbalize your agreement with someone. But stop it. When you ask a question, BACK OFF THE MIC. Smile and nod. You can give your guest a nonverbal affirmation of what they're saying, and it won't distract or annoy listeners. I have literally deleted podcasts (including *an interview* [*with a Nobel Prize winner*](https://news.uchicago.edu/big-brains-7-richard-thaler)) because every time the guest is explaining something interesting, I get a completely unnecessary guttural utterance from the host. It is egregious and can absolutely ruin an otherwise good podcast interview.\n\nOne or two OCCASIONAL affirmations is allowed, like on JRE or a few other shows. But listen to Freakonomics or Hidden Brain or Sam Harris, and you don't get much of it, if at all. Get out of your guest's way. Your listeners will thank you.",

I would say that I don\u2019t think this type of thing bothers me when it\u2019s used to keep a sharp focus on the topic / question, but it does bother me when the interviewee is in the middle of responding to the question that was asked. \n\nIn my mind this sharply contrasts with Jesse Thorn\u2019s interviewing style. He will ask frequently rambling questions that include a lot of mentions of how the interviewee\u2019s work or experiences relate to his, but when the guest responds with often comparably long-winded answers, they usually go interrupted.\n\nStill, I enjoy the final outcome of both interviewers and they are at the top of their class, so while some aspects of their styles may irrationally bug me, I can\u2019t really argue with the result.",

I make sure to tell my guest to avoid this before every conversation, but even then it will still slip in every once in awhile, even from my side, because it's such a common trait of conversation.

I don't want to be a hypocrite so I have to admit that I do this in my own podcasts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have to keep in mind that their are multiple styles of interviews and the big two to keep in mind are professional and casual. for podcasters reading this, just make sure to establish which one you want for your podcast. I do agree with the OP that it can get annoying at some times (I know its a hypocritical statement).  But there's a thin line between sounding like a robot interview and sounding like a casual interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, I do enjoy the like words here and there because it shows that the host or the guest is listening plus it makes the flow of the conversation seem more natural and less scripted. I feel that it would ruin the follow and even make my guest uncomfortable if I kept telling them to not interrupt with single words. Of course I try to keep my own interruption to a minimum since I want to reduce the editing time (that's my reason why i restrain my self) but sometimes I get into the discussion and react as if it was a normal conversation since I want my guest to feel a ease.\n\nBottom line, if you are making a interview podcast or any type of podcast for that matter, you will never satisfy every listener in that genre. Don't get discouraged and keep doing your podcast the way it makes you comfertable since its the only way you will learn to improve and make it your own. Everyone will have an opinion about  your podcast and ask you to change something (e.g. your voice, your guest, your topic, your time, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am well aware that this post creator likes interview podcasts but might not like mine for the reason they mentioned above, and thats ok. BTW i don't mean to disrespect your post. I completely understand your point of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you, [u/fitzrhapsody](https://www.reddit.com/user/fitzrhapsody) for your post. I know some people will take this in consideration and improve their podcast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if I offended you an any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake care,",

Obviously this would be a nod or something face-to-face.\n\nBoth myself and my co-host do this when interviewing and the solution is really simple: just silence your audio tracks during the interviewee's response. If you aren't recording multiple tracks I highly recommend it as it makes this sort of edit so much easier.",

They may have a liberal slant in what they choose to present but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair to compare something like NPR to Rush Limbaugh, which is essentially a politically themed entertainment program. It\u2019s almost apples and oranges. I don\u2019t compare documentaries to reality tv. ",

    "postText": "I listen to a **lot** of podcasts and I\u2019m looking for recommendations. I listen to a wide variety of stuff but Im looking for good, investigative podcasts where the whole series or an entire season is focused on one subject. \n\nI like podcasts about scams, crime (though not necessarily murder focused) and interesting events. \n\nI prefer each episode to be an hour or longer. \n\nThe host has to have a good voice, I vastly prefer podcasts with just one host, I don\u2019t like banter on this type of podcast. \n\nIt has to be available on Apple podcasts and I would greatly prefer if all the episodes have been released already. \n\n*The Sneak* is a great example that I listened to recently, also the first podcast I ever listened to which was called *California City.*\n\nSome that I\u2019ve listened to already:\nS town\n\nThe trojan horse affair\n\nWind of change\n\nThe other Latif\n\nLast seen\n\nSweet Bobby\n\nWest Cork\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nWho the hell is Hamish\n\nThe Dropout\n\nThe punch\n\nThe nobody zone\n\nThe execution of Bonny Lee Bakely\n\nChameleon Hollywood con queen\n\nThanks for any suggestions and if you want my opinion on anything I\u2019ve listened to, feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: formatting",

They then go on a deep dive into the book and trying to find out who wrote the book. \n\nDateline has a few series out. I just got done with Magnilias and Murders. Starting one called  Alibis. \n\nCups of Justice does have more than one host and it does have banter. However they talk more about the legal side of things. It is by the journalist the brought light to the Murdaugh Scandals. \n\nI have one  called Admissible saved. About multiple wrongful convictions all tied to one person.\n\nThat is all I can think of right now\n\n\nI honestly don't know the episode length of any of these as I only listen when I'm walking my dog at night.",

If it isn't done I may just pick it up the next walk.  I walk my dogs multiple times a day but don't always listen to podcasts\n\nIt is really a struggle for me to listen as I comprehend much better by reading co pared to listening.",

It's about the fall down the alt-right pipeline through the help of common media. \n\n In the Dark s2 is good and not really focused much on the crime itself (makes me queasy) but more on the justice system as a whole. The first season is not as good and you don't need to listen to it for the second.",

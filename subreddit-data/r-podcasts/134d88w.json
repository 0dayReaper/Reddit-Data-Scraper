I ask my wife what the name was and she didn\u2019t know cuz her friend forgot the name. Can someone help me find it based off the description below? \n\npodcast where guy discusses stuff only he remembers his. Like breaking his arm. His family doesn\u2019t remember though and then he tries to prove it happened by remembering facts or proof and finding those.",

Both have been featured multiple times in best-of episodes, so they might be available somewhere.\n\nBesides those, I too enjoyed the first couple of seasons of Spooked! and Radio Rental. Not sure the latter features only non-fiction, though.",

Again, just skip through to the stories.\n\n\nThe Night Owl isn\u2019t bad but don\u2019t expect it to be scary at all. It\u2019s more of a therapy for ghosts type ghost-hunter show.\n\nThe first seasons of Unexplained and Lore were good. Both eventually ran out of stuff to talk about.",

Only listen to the first season. \"Remember what it was... Not what it became\" \n\nUncanny &amp; Battersea Poltergeist - isn't it scripted? It always came off as scripted to me.\n\nOtherworld - is hit or miss. Some of the stories boil down to \"I had a weird feeling\" but some are alright.",

Each week one host does a deep dive on a paranormal story and the other host does a deep dive on a true crime story. It's very conversational/rambly between the hosts at times, but the hosts really do their research to get their facts straight about the story each one is presenting. The paranormal stories are generally about haunted places; hauntings and the like in popular culture (ie different haunted dolls, exorcisms, etc); some UFO stuff; occasionally things like popular creepypastas, scientific theories related to paranormal activity....etc. If that sounds like your thing it's a great podcast with years of episodes!",

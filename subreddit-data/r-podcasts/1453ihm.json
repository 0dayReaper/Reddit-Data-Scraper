    "postText": "I rarely post here but this podcast is so good that I was trying to find a place to listen ahead. I just wanted to throw that out there to anybody who enjoys investigative journalism podcast series. I recommend this, it's better a very long time since I've actually went out of my way to make sure I catch the next episode. It is really so good. If anyone can recommend anything in the meantime similar or any investigative journalism I may not have caught, that would be great. Highly recommend but it's only every Monday.\n\n\nEdit to add I believe that I found the recommendation here and if I did thank you so much to that person!",

But it is harmful. \n\nI\u2026 actually have an illness faker / possible factitious person in my family and no one will call her out (including me) because of the drama and bullshit that would ensue. Probably will never happen. So seeing these people have to publicly answer for draining the energy out of everyone who cares about them is definitely cathartic. \n\nThere\u2019s also the schadenfreude of it all!",

The harrowing experience of a teenage girl who was sent to \u201cWilderness Therapy.\u201d \n\nThat, in turn, led me to a seven part series (more in the investigative journalism genre) on The Opportunist about Gayle Palmer, a woman who operated a Wilderness Therapy program in Utah where a young girl died a terrible death just nine days into the program. \n\nThe troubled teen industry is horrifying. Hundreds of children have been tortured, suffered life-long trauma, many of them not surviving. But very little has been done to stop it over the last 30 years. \n\nNeither are an easy listen. Both podcasts are gut-wrenching and brought me to tears. But it\u2019s an important topic. Most of these programs are nothing but very expensive, sanctioned child abuse.",

Just finished this last one. it\u2019s different, hosted by sister of someone w/ munchausen by proxy, mixes in interviews w/ abusers\u2019 families and one brief interview w/ someone that actually has munchausen and is in recovery. (?) (not sure what you call it!)\n\nScamanda I think is malingering vs munchausen, but I similar in the cancer con. \n\nAlso *Suffer the Little Children* has a four-part series on Munch by Proxy but FYI it\u2019s darker/more serious in tone from what I remember. Not that the others aren\u2019t extremely serious, but more of focused on the abuse, if that makes sense.",

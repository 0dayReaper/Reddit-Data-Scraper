    "postText": "1. Not every Substack author offers Text to Voice of their posts because they have to pay for the service.  \n1. The voice is the standard Google directions voice with little personality, flat delivery and some inevitable mispronunciations.\n1. There are almost no ads other than requests to become a paid subscriber and those are one sentence long.\n1. The interface is not sophisticated and allows only [play] and [pause] though for some reason on my lock screen (Android 11) I get a box that allows 15 second ahead and 15 second back.\n1. If I pause listening to play other media and go back to listen to the Substack I have to go back to the start on the app.\n1. There is no speed adjustment on the interface.\n1. Some authors include URL's instead of embedded links. It isn't fun to listen to a URL read aloud but at least on the ones I listen to they are at the end of the essay and I can just stop the player.\n\n\nWith all that these are as good or better than many podcasts for me. I have subscribed to Substacks but seldom taken the time to read them. Text-to-Voice has brought some great information and entertainment to me that I was missing.",

I don't know how complicated it is but if it is easy it might make text to speech a viable alternative to podcasts. I'd gladly listen to the non-substack newsletters I subscribe to (but seldom get around reading).",

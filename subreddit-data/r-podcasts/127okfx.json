            "comment": "Maybe OmegaTau would interest you. It's less about infrastructure or civil engineering and more about systems engineering and aviation. There episodes about tidal energy for example, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear waste storage, weather forecasting and several space telescopes. \n\nIt's a German podcast but there are a lot of English episodes like in my examples. There is an extra feed just for English. \n\nhttps://omegataupodcast.net/category/podcast-en/\n\nhttps://omegataupodcast.net/download-archive/\n\nI'm also looking for good civil engineering podcasts but I don't think there are any. The B1M podcast is too casual for my taste, their YT channel is great though.",

They're especially big on railroads. I believe you can also watch them on Youtube if you want the slides.",

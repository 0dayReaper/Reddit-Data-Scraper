I primarily listen to podcasts, so I go through a lot of them!\n\nI should add:\n\nThe Allusionist - Helen Satlzman talks about language from the perspective of culture and history. It's a current favorite so I can't believe I didn't list. Often has NSFW language, so use headphones at work etc.\n\nAnyone with an interest in the US legal system might want to try:\n\n5-4 - a podcast examining the Supreme Court with a critical eye\n\nMore Perfect - a look at landmark Supreme Court cases that shaped the law\n\nPassing Judgement - law professor Jessica Levinson examines the cases that have a ripple effect in politics and vice versa\n\nStrict Scrutiny - three law professors discuss the Supreme Court in layperson terms. Good for demystifying cases. \n\nSupreme Myths - various law professors discuss constitutional law and the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ha! Mom was right. I should have gone to law school! I didn't realize how many law podcasts I like lol.)",

I\u2019m having trouble articulating what I want, but I can tell you what I don\u2019t want:\n\n- I don\u2019t want to learn anything (news/history)\n- I don\u2019t care for celebrities\n- I don\u2019t care for true crime\n- I don\u2019t care for \u201cguest of the week\u201d\n- no self help\n- no fiction\n\nSo I guess I\u2019m just looking for a \u201cbest friends having a chat\u201d podcast? (I feel like that should be a category but it\u2019s not something I can google). If they have a pop culture / movies / video games theme that would be great, but it\u2019s important they still mostly share personal stories etc (would be great if they are in their 30s navigating a new family)\n\nAs an example: years ago I listened to the rooster teeth podcast (back when it was called the drunk tank podcast) until most of the original cast left.\n\nThanks for your help",

The host admits he doesn\u2019t even game that much anymore. \n\nOn a recent episode he talked about how he accidentally got delivered a jersey mikes giant sub and he only ate half, and instead of throwing it away he jammed it down his garbage disposal and it clogged his sink. The other two hosts started making fun of him and it was really funny. I stopped listening for awhile since their gaming tastes don\u2019t align with mine, but I came back for their personalities.",

But yeah, for me it's true.\n\nIf you like weird, deep, poetic, touching, philosophical, humane stories, you won't find anything better than this podcast. And if you do, please recommend it to me, because I've never found anything close to this.\n\nIt's created by Bianca Giaever for The Believer magazine: [https://www.thebeliever.net/constellation-prize/](https://www.thebeliever.net/constellation-prize/)",

    "postText": "I'm in grad school and this week we're discussing the failures of the rollout for Obamacare. And I've been tortured for the past several days because I'm trying to remember something I learned about it and I can't remember where I heard it. \n\nI'm fairly sure that a few years ago there was a podcast that went into why the Obamacare website failed. I know there's lots of things you could point to, but I remember this focusing on the federal rules for contractors and how when they needed the website built, they were constrained to using contractors who were already approved, even though they didn't have the technical ability to produce what they needed. To get someone new approved would take something like 5 years. \n\nI thought this would have been an episode of Reply All or This American Life, but I've searched for those and haven't found anything. \n\nDoes anyone else remember this?\n\nEDIT:I figured it out. It was Reply All\u2014episode 34: DMV Nation. Thanks for everyone who gave me suggestions.",

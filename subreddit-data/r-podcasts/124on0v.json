It became annoying and boring. \n\nI can barely stomach the podcast anymore without getting tired of it. \n\nThe next one I outgrew would be Cult Liter. Spencer on there is amazing and again, it\u2019s nothing personal. But I guess I just stopped caring.\n\nSo again, tell me what podcast you outgrew and why. \ud83d\ude0a",

I think their initial popularity hurt the writing and the early continuity and some mystery gave way to repetitive, one-off episodes. Maybe it's better now; haven't listened in years.\n\nAlso not quite a fit to your question but Casefile, too. Loved that one and it's really well done but I just stopped listening to true crime entirely during the pandemic and never came back to it. Something about hearing about so many daily fatalities in the headlines all day made \"and the serial killer waited in the garage for the family to fall asleep\" not exactly a great way to decompress.",

It's a shame, because they had a really good thing going for awhile.\n\nThough my breakup with MFM caused me to really pay attention to the true crime content I was consuming and chose to focus on victim-told stories, rather than a third party using their trauma for entertainment and gain.",

The show \"intro\" was just like 45 mins of TV show reviews and Georgia talking about the new house she bought and I just couldn't do it anymore. It sucked because I actually really enjoyed their talking at the beginning when it felt like I could relate to them. It also annoyed me how they were never prepared for their episodes. Georgia's stories were always so sloppy and Karen a lot of the time would just retell an I Survived episode.",

Sword and Scale was one specifically, where he played the 911 call all the way through, and you could hear the grandmother come in, see the dead children and the grandmother wailing in the background as the mother was on the phone with 911 confessing the crime.

They used to be fun and had a catchphrase like \u201clighthearted nightmare\u201d or something like that, but then they went Hollywood and became mean girls and focus waaaaaayyyy too much on calling the murderer something along the lines of \u201cpimple faced fat fucking loser\u201d or something else immature. It just comes off the wrong way, you never see a professional speaking in a documentary in the way that Ashley and Alaina do each and every episode. Wondery ruined the show and I refuse to listen to any wondery podcasts now because of this and how badly they\u2019d ruined a great show. And I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way, go check their reviews. Listeners have been ripping them apart for changing. Unfortunately, they seem like the hosts that dgaf about their listeners",

Come to find out they basically never delivered on the bonus content promised to their patreon subscribers, I just don't like who they've become. Also sometime last year they bailed at the literal last minute before their scheduled appearance at Crime Con (I think...some sort of convention) and only appeared via a pre-recorded panel discussion I believe and provided zero explanation, despite selling VIP tickets to people who were there specifically to see Ash &amp; Alaina, and especially Alaina to get a signed copy of her book and ask questions in the VIP Q&amp;A. They just turned trashy and I'm not here for it.",

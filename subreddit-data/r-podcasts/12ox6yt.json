            "comment": "Just to clarify, are you looking for light hearted distraction podcasts or are you interested in podcasts that keep you informed, but are less depressing? I find listening to \u201cnews\u201d podcasts anxiety inducing, but I like to be informed in less doom and gloom ways. \n\nIf the second, (be informed about the world but less anxious about it) I might recommend some podcasts that have a more optimistic view on progress or approach big topics with a non-politics take. \n\n* 80,000 Hours: Their principle is that you have 80,000 hours in your career, can you pick a job that makes the world better? Good interviews on a wide variety of topics about improving the world. \n\n* Short Wave: nice general science news podcast\n\n* The Future of Everything: from the WSJ, forward-looking usually not doom and gloom. \n\n* All in the Mind: nice psychology and neuroscience news podcast\n\n* Civics 101: not too heavy explainers of US government stuff\n\n* Clever: architecture and design podcast that usually tries to approach big topics from a design and art lens. \n\n* Freakonomics Radio: leans a little more politics, but with a sort of statistics and economics bent and at least isn\u2019t a 24 hr news cycle, they cover things that aren\u2019t urgent. \n\n* Hidden Brain: interest psych/neuro podcast. Sort of \u201cpop science\u201d but interesting. \n\n* Ologies: fun interview podcasts with people who study weird stuff. \n\n* People I mostly admire: interview podcast with academics, business people etc\n\n* Solvable: literally about the big topics in the world being solvable with interviews with people who are advocating or making the changes. \n\n* Tiny Matters: science about microscopic things \n\n* Unexplainable: weird and interesting science tidbits from Vox\n\n* Wait wait, Don\u2019t Tell Me: classic NPR comedy news game show\n\n* What Roman Mars Can Learn about ConLaw: US government stuff that\u2019s in the news, but an explainer rather than an opinion.",

From laughter to wisdom, he has a way with words that make me feel heard and not alone, even though I'm not in contact with him.  \n\n\nHis podcast episodes with Daniele Bolelli are some of my favorites. You can also hear Duncan on **The Drunken Taoist** (Daniele's podcast). Both are great if you're ever looking to get out of a rut or just want to be entertained and learn something new (they both have a variety of guests from all walks of life).",

Griffin McElroy (of My Brother, My Brother, and Me and The Adventure Zone) and his wife Rachel each pick a topic about something the like, something they're into, and things they love and talk about it for about 45-50 minutes a week. They do an excellent job of keeping things light, and it's all very positive, insightful, and funny. They're so incredible together, too. It's a nice break. It has a pretty decent backlog as well with 360 episodes, so if you're looking for something to dig into, this is a good one! The format was a bit different at the start, where they each would pick two topics, but they've since had two kids, so they've switched to the one topic each so they didn't have to do as much research every week.",

Great banter, likeable characters. \n\n[Two Princes](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-two-princes/) \\- Fantasy comedy. Really well done, with great actors like Christine Baransky. \n\nAnd maybe even our show [HUMAN-B-GON](https://link.chtbl.com/humanbgon?sid=red). Scifi dark comedy set in the future after the machines have taken over, and robots are hired to 'ethically relocate' stray humans. Warning: violence and stupidity",

Produced by Rusty Quill.\n\nAnother one is Midnight Burger is about a diner that travels across time/space/dimensions. Occasionally a little bit serious, but mostly very, very funny.",

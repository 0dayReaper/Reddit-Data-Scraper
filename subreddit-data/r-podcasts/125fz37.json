The podcasts can involve sex advice, female pleasure, funny sex stories; I don\u2019t mind the subject as long as sexuality and pleasure are discussed positively. \n\nThank you for any recs!",

She's a doctor and sex educator but feels like a friend. I believe she has a spin off audio only podcast, but the visual element of the channel can be really helpful.",

    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m looking for a scripted podcast with preferably educational content. Think half as interesting or wendover productions but as a podcast. I don\u2019t like conversational podcasts, but at the same time I\u2019d prefer one that didn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m listening to a documentary, some humour would be great. Maybe something like hank green, but as a podcast (I\u2019m aware he has a podcast, but I don\u2019t love the conversation part of it).\nThank you in advance for the recommendations:)",

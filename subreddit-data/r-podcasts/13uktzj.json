I don't know if there's a podcast that tells them, but if there isn't, someone should get on it because that would be awesome. \n\nI mean someone aboriginal who knows the stories and the different tribes stories too, not some white people who like the stories and read them from a book. Coz I'd do it myself if it wasn't more white people taking their stuff, wrecking it and doing it wrong. You know where I'm coming from I'm sure.",

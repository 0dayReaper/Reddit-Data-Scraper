Sometimes I can't be hitting the back button until I find the right moment, even when I can, skipping through minutes of content to find a couple of words can be really tedious and break the flow of the show",

That's the thing about being a celebrity that's doing a podcast, you already have an audience that is going to listen to your thing. And you have the money to market and advertise anywhere you possibly can. There's no incentive to do the little things that really matter: Show notes, chapters, artwork, etc. Which is really a shame but even the small podcasters don't do it either and it makes me sad. I straight up unsubscribe if it's a show that keeps talking about something and doesn't give me a way to check it out.\n\nYeah I listen to ATP constantly and John was talking about Show notes awhile back. I'll see if I can find the episode and I'll edit it in [here](https://overcast.fm/+R7DXJaHyU/1:27:36) with timestamp",

Not an expert, just a guy doing a thing: \n\n-\tFrequency of episodes doesn't matter for something like YouTube. For podcasting it does matter if you're growing. The first few episodes won't matter until the algorithm knows when you post. After you settle into a good routine your listeners will know and it'll be displayed in your podcast information. It'll say something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/2mJbaHm.jpg) (mine as an example)\n-\tThe episode linked in the first link dives into hosting better than I do. I use anchor and like it. But there are better options for analytics if that's your thing. Spotify bought Anchor so their analytics should take over soon",

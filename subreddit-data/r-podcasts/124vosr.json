I've tried to dip back in now and then, but the cases are no longer Australian-only, which is what initially drew me to the series, and even if they were, we've either covered them or will cover them ourselves, so no spoilers! \n\nReally wish I could get back into true crime podcasts but, alas, it was not meant to be (so far).",

It's hosted by an Australian woman who lives in Canada. The first bunch of episodes are good but a little hit and miss. She found her groove though and I like how she tells the stories.\n\nObscura is another one that's pretty good. The host is just a regular dude. He talks in a funny way (as in, he pauses where I wouldn't usually put a comma in the sentence), but generally his are pretty good.",

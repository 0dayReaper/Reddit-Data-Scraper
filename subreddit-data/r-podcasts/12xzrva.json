Pretty much all of the best series', imo.

Lots of intrigue and lies)\n\nThe Patch (GREAT idea for a series. Loved every episode)\n\nShock and War: Iraq 20 years on\n\nThe Coming Storm\n\nFile on 4 (some episodes are better than others)\n\nThere are some from other outlets too, though. Such as: \n\nThe Bellingcat Podcast (specificlally the series about MH370. That's one of my favourites! But they are all interesting)\n\nInto the Grey Zone (take some of the hysterical people with a pinch of salt. The overall content and delivery is still super interesting)",

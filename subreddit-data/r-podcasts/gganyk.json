I usually listen to Planet Money, Marketplace, Science Vs, Every Little Thing, Reply All, 99% Invisible, Make Me Smart, No Such Thing As a Fish, BBC Global News Podcast, and a few others.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

If you are into how things go to be the way they are and a history we never hear anything about, you might like it. Each episode is kinda long and rambles so it is more of a gentle I don't want to think about things podcast that a snappy and upbeat distraction. \n\nRabbit Hole about Youtube has been pretty good. \n\nFor just hearing people I can pretend are my friends talking just because to hear them talk I feel happy, try You're Wrong About. They are trying to do one a week and during this pandemic it is a book club where they tell you about a book so you don't have to read it yourself, which is kinda . . . novel. \n\nI started from the beginning of the Totalus Rankium because I just enjoy hearing those cousins talk to each other. They rank emperors and presidents. If you want a taste try the episode on Rutherford Hayes, now my very favorite president for someone you would want to have a beer with.",

I don't know what it is about it, but the recent episodes have been triggering anxiety for me. Past episodes of This American Life that are in their archive might be up your alley. If you are into history at all, I would recommend The History of England; sometimes you can hear nature sounds in the background because the narrator records out of his garage and he has a very soothing voice. It is all-around informative and lovely, in my opinion.

You also get a bit of geographical history too because he's explaining how tribes of people with different languages travelled and mixed.  A calm podcast good for walking or falling asleep. \n\n\"History Of Philosophy Without Any Gaps\" - This one is pretty self explanatory.  The narrator has a gentle humour which makes me smile.  Another calm one. \n\n\"How I Built This\" - interviews with people who started what are now huge companies.  Again some wonderful stories. \n\nAny of Stephen Fry's podcasts - he's got such a wonderful voice, is incredibly intelligent but can explain things without using long words.  He generally does a short series, so you don't need to worry about a long term commitment.",

Never really liked the slow paced banter-filled style before, but I'm appreciating it more and more. They upload like 5 days a week too, which is nice. It's not super heady stuff but it's interesting and fun.",

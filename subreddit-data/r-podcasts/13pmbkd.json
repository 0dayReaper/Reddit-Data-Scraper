At the beginning, I really felt for her and believed that every single adult in her life failed her, including people she tried to reach out to for help, like the police. Now, I\u2019m not sure.  When she told the story about her dad pushing her down the stairs and then later suffering what she thinks was a miscarriage, something didn\u2019t sit right with me! What did you think?!",

I didn\u2019t have a great childhood, and I had an abusive father but I never killed him. When you get to the part about the stripper pole I feel like she definitely lies about how much she wanted it. Also I\u2019ve known several girls when I was younger that made up pregnancies and losses which was always so weird to me, but just by the picture of her that\u2019s in my mind she\u2019s definitely the type. \n\nOn a different note, I\u2019ve googled her pictures and it\u2019s nuts to me that the podcast chose a picture that made her look prettier than all the rest that are out there. She doesn\u2019t/didn\u2019t look like that",

The podcast was well done!  When I was reflecting on it, it does seem strange that she wasn\u2019t more emotional about it all. There were times she got choked up but for the most part she didn\u2019t, even when telling stories about abuse and potential miscarriage. I do think she had mental health issues that were not treated - and that was her parents\u2019 job to get her help!  It was her parents\u2019 responsibility to get her treated with therapy and medication.  Maybe they tried, and just became exhausted dealing with her issues?  I looked up her pictures after reading your comment, and you\u2019re right- they looking nothing like the picture on the podcast cover. Not that it matters, I think she looked pretty/normal either way.  Thanks for making this thread, it is fun to discuss!",

The way she described it as \u2018the gun went off\u2019 vs \u2018I shot him\u2019 or \u2018I pulled the trigger\u2019. I also think it\u2019s interesting what she is saying about the public defender. It makes me wonder if lie detector tests are completely scam able",

It wasn\u2019t a mistake if it was determined to be first degree murder. \n\nHer letter to her sister rubbed me the wrong way. Her sister has set boundaries and does not want to talk to her so Crystal publicizes her message to her.\n\nI think Crystal has convinced herself that this is all one big mistake so she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s lying so the lie detector did not pick up on that. Or she scammed the test.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I\u2019be been listening to the same type of podcasts and have been having trouble branching out. I prefer podcasts that sound like dateline or bbc, etc- less conversational. \n\nI\u2019m looking for podcasts that talk about these oddly specific subjects: \n\n- How current behaviour is influenced by primitive traits/evolution\n\n- Biographies and information on classic or famous literature/writers; Edgar Allen Poe, Sylvia Plath, Sappho\n\n- History: Middle Ages, Rome/and areas, buddhist history, Egypt, paganism. \n\n- Biographies and information on philosophers and/or breakdowns of their famous works etc.",

Maybe you could get an audiobook of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"History: Middle Ages, Rome/and areas, buddhist history, Egypt, paganism.\" - Fall of Civilizations either on YouTube or as a podcast!",

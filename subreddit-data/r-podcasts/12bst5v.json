Contact the show, tell them to research podcast LUFS, and no matter what their energy level is it will then sound fine with their ads",

There are 2 that are really bad on this but I won\u2019t name them. A nationally known TrueCrime Pod that I will name is 48  Hours. Based on the crime show-whoever is the sound editor on that show just doesn\u2019t care. There are several people who have complained about their ad volume but obviously the program doesn\u2019t read these or just doesn\u2019t care. If you have ear buds on it truly is jarring. I won\u2019t listen for that reason.",

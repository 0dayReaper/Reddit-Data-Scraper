At the least, they all take umbrage with the modern political left/ \"woke\" left.\n\nIn the interest of balance, and of not being dictated to by algorithims, I was looking for some thoughtful deeper analysis style podcasts that provide well reasoned commentary, from a more socially left/ progressive standpoint.\n\nMany thanks for any reccos.",

Liberals are, as a matter of political theory, on the right. If you've never uncovered this fact to date, it may sound wrong to you, but I assure you that any political ideology that allies with capitalism (which is a right-wing mode of political economy) is, to be sure, on the right.\n\nThe Left (capital L) is socialism/communism/anarchism. These are decidedly anti-capitalist modes of political economy. Biden, AOC, Bernie, etc are not \"the left\", as much as the internet right commentators such as Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro want them to be. Same goes for NPR, PBS, etc who are all confined to an effectively pro-capitalist (or at least agnostic to capitalism's hegemony) narrative. These people &amp; things may be *liberal*, but liberals are only the center-left wing of capital. They still uphold the will of corporations, monopoly capital, US military hegemony, etc.\n\nAll that said, my podcast recommendations below are of the real deal Left.\n\n* Revolutionary Left Radio (runs the gamut, all topics covered &amp; extensive back catalogue)\n\n* Guerrilla History (history of proletarian struggles across the globe)\n\n* The Deprogram (shit talking + in depth political analysis + current events)\n\n* Red Nation (Indigenous issues + cultural topics eg TV shows &amp; movies)\n\n* The East is a Podcast (political analysis, veers towards the Middle East &amp; Iran a lot but really everything is covered)\n\n* Citations Needed (media analysis)\n\n* The Black Myths Podcast (debunks myths about Black Americans)\n\n* Blowback (history of US empire, exceedingly well researched)\n\n* Radio Free Amanda (political analysis, veers China but covers lots)\n\n* Silk &amp; Steel (Chinese history)\n\n* Eyes Left (US military)",

I'm sure national socialists would have a similar problem as you with that categorisation...\n\nYou seem to use a definition of \"left\" based on whether they are against capitalism. But 1) being against capitalism is a spectrum; only very fringe elements are against every element of capitalism. 2) What is capitalism precisely, anyway? 3) The original left were very pro-capitalism, as in they were against landed interests, the aristocracy, etc.\n\nFinally, the OP asked for \"left-leaning\" suggestions. Ie. the OP probably wasn't looking the extreme Leftists.\n\nTldr: you could just have written: \"Here are some suggestions from a far left perspective\".",

I'm not acting as any sort of authority here except as a relayer of the information.\n\nWithin the confines of US domestic politicking, one can be more leftward than another, but just because one is \"on the left\" within this narrow window, does not mean they are leftists, by any meaningful definition that exists. There is an entire world, and an entire history of that world, outside of the Fox/CNN/NPR bubble, my friend.\n\n&gt;Ironically, you don't mind categorising a couple of people as \"right commentators\".\n\nBecause by *any* existing definition, the people I named are categorically on the right.\n\n&gt;being against capitalism is a spectrum; only very fringe elements are against every element of capitalism.\n\nThis is literally only something that someone whose entire political imagination has existed within the confines of US capitalist realism would say and think. You are a great case in point for why what I said is important to point out.\n\n&gt;What is capitalism precisely, anyway?\n\nAgain, there is a rich history of political theory on the topic. If you don't know about it, that's ok, but just acting here like because you asked a question you assume to be undefinable or whatever isn't a \"gotcha\". You're just admitting your lack of understanding on the topic.\n\n&gt;The original left were very pro-capitalism\n\nWho's the \"original left\" you're even referring to here? Seems like you're just making stuff up as you continue to type.\n\nYou seem to be making a mountain out of a molehill because you didn't previous know this information.

It's possible for Leftists to argue and denounce each other as \"capitalist lapdogs\" (which historically they have) for this precise reason.

They never clickbait, overstate, or act outraged in the 21st century \"politics\" way that 98% of media taps into these days. I come away every three episodes or so feeling really empowered with the information presented, and having a much more nuanced understanding of the history or structure of issues they discuss. \n\nCan't recommend The Dig more highly, but don't worry if you feel lost for the first couple tries.

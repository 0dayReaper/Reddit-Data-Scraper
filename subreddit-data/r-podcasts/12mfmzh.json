    "postText": "I recently came across the feature of having a Music + Talk experience on Spotify, that combines a normal music playlist with spoken voice intermissions, similar to a radio show for example. \n\nI feel like it's quite rare though, and I haven't seen it being used very much. Please leave some examples down for this very interesting feature if you know any! Thank you!",

He would do a short into, telling folks what the theme of the night was...and then for like an hour or so just play music. i think it was once a week, maybe twice.\n\nhe had a Beatles nights...women in rock night....disco....etc etc etc.",

I think some people struggle with \u2018wait, what is this?\u2019 radio show or podcast?) and not all get the idea that you have to be logged into Spotify to hear full songs.",

I was thinking of starting something similar to this, would you have any advice on hosting this particular format? also, have you considered/found a way to host it on different podcast platforms other than spotify?",

I personally think Youtube music is REALLY underrated. \n\nAnd FYI, I'm really not trying to sound rude, but it's no longer called Youtube Red anymore. It hasn't for some time now. The premium version is called \"Youtube Premium.\" I think it's tremendous value though at $12/month because you get Youtube ad-free AND Youtube music ad-free too. \n\nI personally chose Youtube music because it has a lot of underground music. I know Spotify and Apple Music only have music that is popular or mainstream.\n\nOh, and while you choose a song to listen to, you have the option to choose to see the music videos when you play songs. After all music videos are always uploaded to Youtube.",

Best podcast in the world and it's going thru the 60s now. The Small Faces and Pink Floyd episodes might be a good start. Then if you like it you can delve into the 3 hour Beatles episodes.",

Andrew Hickey is a GD treasure &amp; he goes so in depth to develop the context of each artist &amp; what was culturally going on that you\u2019ll go back again because you can\u2019t catch everything. \n\nI don\u2019t like The Grateful Dead, but holy cow! I now can appreciate their contribution &amp; influence to culture &amp; music now!",

Not the UK, obviously, but they are two of the most significant elections in the last century and they are fascinating in their own right. And the parallels he makes to modern politics are really interesting. He goes pretty deep and does a great job of putting you in the time period. It's fun and short so it's easy to binge.",

    "postText": "Any recommendations for news podcasts focusing on Asia, that are well-researched like **Last Week Tonight** or **Sissy's World News** or **BBC's Africa Daily**? I know Sissy's World News sort of answers my own questions but it's video format and Youtube, not podcast. \n\nSo far I've found **Ear to Asia**, and **Analysis Asia**. Language can be either English or Mandarin (helps my ears practice). \n\nSissy's World News is great and well researched but it features a lot of foreign news clips in many different languages, making it impossible to listen-only as a podcast. \n\nSo I'm looking to collect more news podcast focusing on Asia. Also if any good ones focusing on Africa will be great too, although right now I am very happy with BBC's Africa Daily, it's still just 1.",

    "postText": "Morning everyone. I just finished re-listening to The Black Tapes and forgot how much I loved it. Have there been any newly released podcasts, mysteries with a supernatural twist to them, that anyone could recommend? Never found anything I liked quite as much as Black Tapes (even the other shows those guys did never peeked my interest), but I haven't checked out anything new in a while now. Thanks for any help!",

Bridgewater's writing and production values are really good. \n\nA bonus sci fi suggestion:\n* Space Busker 2061 \nI can't get over how fun this series is. It's not horro or paranormal, but it has fantastic world building.",

The eps are short and take place in 1921.  More supernatural than most, too.  Badlands Cola is another one I'm deep into and it's better than I expected.  It gets REALLY interesting as you progress. I'm looking for more like these, too, and I'll check out Black Tapes.  Cheers!",

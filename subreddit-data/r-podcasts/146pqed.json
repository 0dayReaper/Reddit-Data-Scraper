It\u2019s a crew working together, not a lone person working alone and eavesdropping, but espionage and surveillance plays a big part of the first season. To say more would spoil things. It\u2019s a mostly cozy story about a smuggling crew trying to survive in a totalitarian space regime. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for but it\u2019s the only thing I know that\u2019s even in the same ballpark",

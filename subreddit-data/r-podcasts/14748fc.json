Either that or I just don\u2019t have the time/patience to try out the numerous podcasts that touch on a similar topic. I\u2019ve tried LPOTL in the past and it just doesn\u2019t do it for me. I\u2019ve yet to find the time to try out these recommendations so I\u2019m hoping one of them hits. Hope the same happens for you \ud83e\udee1",

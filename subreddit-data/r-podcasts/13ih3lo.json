    "postText": "So, I\u2019ve reached a point in my search where I feel like I\u2019ve looked up as many buzzword combinations as possible and still haven\u2019t found it. I figured this might be my best bet at reuniting with an old podcast love of mine. I\u2019ll do my best to describe it. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a podcast about a person who was given a task to go through boxes full of cassette tapes. I believe it was set in a cabin as well. I think they were meant to live there and listen to all the tapes. After a few tapes things start getting weird and that\u2019s all I can remember unfortunately. \n\nI\u2019m really hoping someone sees this and knows which podcast I\u2019m talking about!! I was giving someone recommendations and realized it had disappeared from my podcasts.\n\n(I use Apple Podcasts if that happens to narrow it down)\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can provide!",

I was bummed with the way the show turned out* since Ive envisioned it differently for a long time. \n\nHave you listened to The Deep Vault? It's also very good, but can get gruesome in parts.\n\n*for clarifixation, the show is enjoyable! And I like the actors. I just envisioned it differently and would love to create my own interpretation someday ^_^",

    "postText": "A few days ago *Obscura: A True Crime Podcast* was featured in the creator's local newspaper. It was a nice example of an indie podcaster who 'made it' in a market of big company blockbusters. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/caa1z7/my_podcast_is_featured_in_the_tampa_bay_times/) is the post Justin made to celebrate.\n\nHowever, since then *Obscura* has received exactly a hundred one star ratings on iTunes in one night. While it's possible that the exposure led to some genuine negative reviews, the sheer quantity, and specific number of them, is suspicious. The creator [believes he is being targeted with false ratings](https://twitter.com/obscuracrimepod/status/1148731628069498881?s=19) and I agree. This is doubly disappointing because Justin has been a regular contributor to this sub. Malicious reviews are always possible for any podcaster, but with Apple's less-than-stellar history of handling the abuse of its rankings, it's possible that these ratings will harm his shows' future prospects.\n\nHopefully with enough attention the sleeping giant that is iTunes might look into it.\n\n__________________________\n\nEdit: Since I made this post, the 100 ratings appear to have been removed, only for [even more to appear](https://twitter.com/obscuracrimepod/status/1149020205873586176). \n\nAlso, thanks to [Podnews](https://podnews.net/update/podfront-launch) for covering this. I'm interested to see if Mike Boudet (I didn't want to outright name him, but it's silly not to when *everyone* in the comments and on Twitter suspects this was him) responds to their reaching out.",

Others have said it, and I agree - Apple needs to find a way to fix this.  If someone gets dozens of negative reviews in a very short amount of time, they should have some kind of red flag pop up for their security team to immediately be notified and investigate before the damage becomes too severe.",

Reddit not only shadow banned Mike, they flat out banned him from being on Reddit as much as they could because he was such a nightmare. \n\nSince then, Mike has doxxed Justin and harassed him in a lot of fucked up ways. \n\nWhen Justin decided to try his hand at podcasting Mike lost his shit. \n\nHe now tells anyone who will listen to him that Justin hijacked the subreddit from him (other way around) and started a \"competing podcast\" to fuck with him and his business. \n\nMike Boudet hiring bots is one of the most believable things I've ever heard knowing his personality.",

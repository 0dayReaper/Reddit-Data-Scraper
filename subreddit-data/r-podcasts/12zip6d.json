    "postText": "I used to love this show but stopped tuning in regularly once life got busy. I caught the host line-up changes and didn\u2019t mind. Jerusalem and German were fine. But then, life got much busier, and I stopped tuning in entirely.\n\nToday, I listened to two new episodes for the first time in years and was disappointed. It\u2019s become a longer version of the other Vox podcast, Today Explained\u2014smash-cut news clips and all\u2014that no longer contains an in-depth group discussion.\n\nI\u2019m looking for something that captures the older vibe before it became an interview show. Something like Slate\u2019s Political Gabfest, but policy-oriented, not politics oriented. I\u2019m open to something with hosts with varied views, but I\u2019m center-left to left in outlook.\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated!",

Also I was disappointed it wasn\u2019t the news from a weed smokers perspective.",

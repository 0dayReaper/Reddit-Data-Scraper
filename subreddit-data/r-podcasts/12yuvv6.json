    "postText": "Can anyone recommend a Podcast focusing on Geopolitics? With that many changes in World from Ukraine, the rise of BRICS to Taiwan, it would be nice to have a Podcast which centers about global politics. Preferable with a well-informed unbiased Host. IF you know a Podcast like that, please let me know? A Podcast which is focused on China or India would be interesting as well. Thanks in advance!",

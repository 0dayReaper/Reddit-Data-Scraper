Any suggestions?",

Love his voice. Soren Narnia I think he goes by?).\n\n\n*Others I love*:\n\n**Strange Air** (in the format of a radio show at first and it transforms into a mystery with voice actors)\n\n**Scared to Death** (approximately four apparently true horror stories read by a husband and wife team--husband does Timesuck which is a fabulous podcast about SO many different topics)\n\n**Horror Hill** (bunch of different scary stories--similar to The No Sleep Podcast)\n\n**The Warning Woods** (the first few were kinda meh but the writer/narrator has really come into his own and the newer episodes are great. A different scary story every episode--like Knifepoint Horror in some ways)\n\n**Creepy A Horror Podcast** (one of my favorite \"bunch of different scary stories\" type podcast. Love the narrator)\n\n**Mayfair Watchers Society** (another one where there is one story per episode). \n\nI am a horror story fan and these are all in my rotation. I think I get most excited about Knifepoint Horror. Can't recommend that enough!",

I mean, you're making an audio drama show, and you need an excuse for it to be audio -- Archive 81 has a trope about the sound being important, and Magnus does this thing about the physical tapes being the only way the stories can be recorded.\n\nMalevolent is really cunning in providing an in-universe sort of scheme whereby it makes sense that everything is described to the listener, except when it's not for reasons of suspense. Absolutely genius move on the part of the creator.",

    "postText": "This may sound highly specific but if anyone knows some great fiction podcasts, preferably one that follows a male character with demons and he\u2019s like seeing horror or something like that. I guess similar to Strawberry Spring or Paralyzed style. Sci-fi is okay too but still I like a realistic setting like Earth and not another planet. \n\n\nSome psychological stuff too is cool. Thanks",

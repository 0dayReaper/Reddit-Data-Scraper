    "postText": "Greeking out and (often) Myths and Legends are appropriate for kids and told in an engaging way.\n\nI\u2019d like to find Bible stories told in that style - scrubbed but with a little nod to the stories being *nuts* by modern standards, plus entertaining.\n\nI\u2019d like to find something where the style is not too precious. It\u2019s okay if the podcast doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in the Bible as a religious text.\n\nBible stories that don\u2019t assume that the listener is Christian, that are told in a fun and engaging way, and clean enough for kids, smart enough for early teens.",

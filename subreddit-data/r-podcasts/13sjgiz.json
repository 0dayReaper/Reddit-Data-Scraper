I don't even see an option to add an RSS feed but then again I didn't pay for the full version.  \n\n\nIf it's worth anything, I have Castbox and was able to unsubscribe from it / search again / resubscribe. So it's definitely on that app, which only costs $0.99 for the full version if you want ad-free.",

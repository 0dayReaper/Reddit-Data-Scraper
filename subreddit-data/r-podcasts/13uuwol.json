Like some of their mic sounds absolutely horrible, and sometimes it's just dudes talking over discord.\n\nSo I just want a podcast that has an actual team behind it, with an actual setup like in the same room and not just dudes talking over discord. Hopefully a good mic as well.\n\nExample being Trash Taste",

I just checked their YouTube and they barely have 4k subs and get like less than 400 views per video. How do they even make a profit out of it or is it just like a hobby for them?\n\nDespite that I think they are ok but they aren't in the same room, and they have basically no actual podcast setup. Not really my thing honestly",

Sound quality is pretty good and I know the main guy engineers it pretty well from what I\u2019ve heard. From what you\u2019re asking podcast production quality-wise I\u2019d say it\u2019s one of the tops in that tier right below Trash Taste. Cuz you are correct there aren\u2019t that many that are actually set up like Trash Taste afaik",

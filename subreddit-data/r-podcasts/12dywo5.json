If not interviews in both, definitely a detailing of how they were involved. \n\n\nAnd Bad Blood has the added benefit of being hosted by the journalist that was intimidated by Holmes and her henchpeople after breaking the story. It is my fave of the Theranos pods. \n\nParcast had a series that is perfectly serviceable \u2014 called Whistleblowers \n\nSwindled has an episode called Whistleblower about Karen Silkwood.",

But nothing, absolutely nothing, can come close to the book by the award-winning journalist, John Carreyrou, who busted the case wide open. Carreyrou's book, on which most of the documentaries and podcasts are based (or draw heavily from) is called \"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup.\" Of you find Theranos interesting, I cannot recommend it enough.",

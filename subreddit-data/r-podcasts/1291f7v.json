    "postText": "***TW: alleged stalking, harassment, &amp; defamation by a show and/or its fans and guests***\n\nSynopsis: \n\nWondery\u2019s Something Was Wrong (SWW) Season 15 Episodes 8 &amp; 9 feature a mommy vlogger claiming to be a victim of stalking and harassment while simultaneously making allegations against, and doxxing the identities of, individuals who participated in a discord. [This recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWPodVeryUnofficial/comments/128uhl9/the_result_of_being_doxed_by_a_sww_guest/) shows redacted harassing messages sent to an individual whose identity was doxxed as a result of SWW S15 Episode 9. According to comments made in r/SWWPodVeryUnofficial multiple individuals now claim they are being threatened and harassed as a result of the episode and some are reportedly seeking legal action against the show or its guest(s).  \n\nBackstory: \n\nThe last few episodes of Something Was Wrong, currently in its 15th season, feature mommy vlogger Lex Fitzgerald and a SWW Season 9 update from host Tiffany and a previous guest. Both topics are likely to result in legal action related to harassment and defamation. Ironically, Tiffany Reese and the show\u2019s guests claim they are the actual victims of harassment, while leveraging the SWW platform to gleefully Regina George their way through revealing information about other people\u2019s identities, including personal information about children.\n\nAs some may recall, 6 months ago Tiffany Reese and an admin of the SWW Facebook group were allegedly involved in threatening to doxx a moderator of an unofficial SWW reddit sub. The SWW Facebook admin used Instagram DMs to threaten to release the mod\u2019s personal identity if the mod did not shut down the reddit sub. Tiffany Reese also contacted the reddit mod over Instagram DM at the same time to complain about harassment and alleged obsession by the mod. [Summary here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimePodcasts/comments/yvpqfy/tiffany_reese_host_of_something_was_wrong_has/)\n\nThat same sub r/unofficial_SWW_pod went dark under mysterious circumstances last weekend. The day before the unofficial SWW sub went dark, Tiffany Reese posted to Instagram saying she is a victim of \u201charassment, stalking, and defamation\u201d from unofficial online discussion groups and has hired \u201ccybersecurity.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s husband has apparently [made comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWPodcast/comments/11v6hcx/what_the_fahhk/) in unofficial SWW subs defending Tiffany and calling sub participants \u201cabusers\u201d and \u201cproven liars.\u201d His reddit account appears to have been recently deleted. \n\nThe question remains. Is it acceptable to use a true crime podcast as a platform to bully, harass or allegedly slander private individuals? Has a show which claims to be about \u201cthe discovery, trauma, and recovery from shocking life events and abusive relationships\u201d become a source for harassment and abuse?",

Not at all surprised that the podcast and especially the host are now caught up in a bunch of drama. It's always been so messy and at times toxic, while simultaneously claiming to be empowering women and lifting up survivors.",

Her girl boss vibes are weird. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ll say it, so many stories started to seem like the girl who peaked in high school with now too much time on her hands complaining about a friendship gone wrong or a weird dating experience. Like men cheat \ud83d\ude2c we know they\u2019re awful lol.  \n\nI got weirded out after it seemed multiple seasons featured fundamentalist Christians with like already weirdly toxic relationships with their families, IMHO. \n\nLike wait, did I just listen to 6 episodes of a podcast where the premise was - \u201cMy life was thrown upside down because the guy who was shady and strange on our first date was shady and strange for the 8 weeks I knew him!\u201d\n\nYes, believe victims. But she\u2019s gets personally involved in like an icky way. \n\nWhen I heard how personally she was involved with the girls from season 14 I just got this feeling like all her credibility was thrown out the door. \n\nYou know that feeling when you\u2019re reading the relationship advice sub and OP will be describing the interaction, e.g., \u201cI have no idea why they were angry about the issue but I calmly told them that their feelings were valid and we could sit down and have a constructive conversation\u2026\u201d like come ON of course you\u2019re going to frame yourself as being calm cool and collected to be perfectly innocent. \n\nPlus, I\u2019m sorry but she\u2019s just so cringe lol. The way she says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you\u201d always kills me. \n\nOk roast over \ud83d\ude02.",

But ya now it\u2019s like there\u2019s no integrity. I keep going back to the podcast bc i don\u2019t have much social life and need things to listen to when I\u2019m at work or exercising etc. and like. This reality hits me again. It\u2019s kinda middle school-ish. Like I\u2019m in the beginning of the show she\u2019s all \u201cI AM NOT A THERAPIST NOR DOCTOR\u201d. And so I think. Soooooooo you\u2019re essentially just gossiping here. And then keeps all commenting off bc it\u2019s uncomfortable to hear the flip side of the story. Like\u2014- a couple of days ago i listened to this one about this girl Emilia who had a the worst boyfriend in the world. He was complete crap from the gate and I\u2019m supposed to bubble over with empathy because she continually made the terrible decision to be with him. Then, Emilia reveals he\u2019s a surgeon who performs SURGERIES DRUNK. and this chick is a narrating that she would pretend to be the nurse on duty so to cover up his drunkenness at work. Nice. So she\u2019s a fucking criminal and tiff says not a thing about it. Like - where are any adults? podcasters are supposed to guide our thinking. This show jumped the shark so bigtime. I\u2019m still going to watch it tho. Just I did when Jerry springer realized he got better ratings by switching his concept to HUMAN ZOO.",

            "comment": "I am not a fan of this podcast for a few reasons:\n\nThe host is Tiffany Reese (TR), and I think she had intentions of being a victim\u2019s advocate who helps survivors of various abuses get their story out. However, TR doesn\u2019t practice good ethics or safety in her podcast and pursuit of people to \u201csave.\u201d \n\nExample: Season 9\u2013Kenji, Danielle, Ardie, Darcy\nThis season was about the drama and danger surrounding a man named Ardie who was reported to be a violent con artist. Some of the drama focuses on Darcy cheating on Kenji and leaving him for Ardie, which leads to a lot of abuse and safety issues stemming from Ardie. However, TR did not attempt to interview Darcy nor give her warning that this podcast was going to air. A significant portion of this season is used building up how dangerous and violent Ardie is. It is basic domestic abuse knowledge that the most dangerous time for a victim is when they try to leave. So journalistically, TR didn\u2019t give Darcy the opportunity to share her story, which led to her being vilified and doxxed by her listeners. She also didn\u2019t warn Darcy about the podcast; Darcy found out it existed when someone took her doxxed information and messaged her about it. If TR cares about victims, why would she willing put one in danger? TR clearly addressed this in an Instagram story where she expressed that Darcy was not alerted because she was worried Darcy would tell Ardie and get the season stopped. Translation? Airing this season mattered more than Darcy\u2019s safety even though it was reiterated over and over that there were times they were genuinely scared Ardie might kill them. \n\nTR does not provide any information from any professional sources. She may read dictionary or DSM definitions of things, but the closest she has ever gotten to having an expert on the show in dealing with abuse was with the season done about Amy Chessler who experienced massive trauma and has since written books and become a true advocate.  Without sources like law enforcement or someone who is a professional (whether practitioner, lawyer, et cetera) the seasons end up with a lot of victim blaming and shaming because there is no one to explain that some of these actions people take during abuse that may not make sense to others are quiet common. Additionally, without resources or insight on red flags, what is commonly seen in these situations, how people can seek help, the podcast becomes trauma dumping. So we have these massively traumatic stories in which the survivor gets to vent out what happened, which is great in that respect, sort of, but without any sort of summation, education, or anything other than \u201cI am /so/ sorry,\u201d it\u2019s just a lot of trauma taken in. Granted, the listener has a responsibility to check in with themselves and know when to turn off the podcast, but I am also assuming that the average person doesn\u2019t know or may not consider the ramifications of binge listening to 45 minutes of trauma with no break or even whole seasons. Recent studies are indicating that participating in trauma dumping, even as a listener, reader, whatever, leads to heightened stress/cortisol release, heightened blood pressure, et cetera. All of which can lead to different maladaptive behaviors and thoughts, but also increase likelihood of things like depression and anxiety, and this might not even be noticed for a while. This isn\u2019t something I expect the average listener to think about, but if someone is marketing themselves and podcast as advocacy or self help, I expect them to know this and handle it appropriately. \n\nTR hasn\u2019t been a great advocate for people her avid fans choose to harass and dox if they have a negative opinion of the show or TR. This has led to many instance of cyber stalking, cyber bullying, and at least four instances I have heard of of people being threatened or fearing for their safety based on thinly veiled threats. She encourages the image of those who don\u2019t like her style of podcast to be that of an abuser. This is not advocate behavior. Even if you don\u2019t like what people have to say about you, if you want to help against violence, you have to speak out and stop it in your own threshold. \n\nSome of the episodes have issues of truth and facts. A specific recent episode comes to mind, but I am not getting into that at this time, and my biggest issue with the show isn\u2019t the back and forth drama, but the irresponsible production. \n\nThe podcast is about entertainment. It\u2019s exploitative in that TR presents it as a healing platform, but as someone who is a practitioner? Letting people tell their story is only a fraction of the work needed to heal. In my professional opinion, TR\u2019s actions speak of prioritization of listenership numbers more than healing or advocacy. Her techniques are lazy and have the potential to cause more harm than help. I think if she took time to be educated on advocacy and wanted her platform to also have experts weigh in and give their perspectives, explain behaviors commonly seen, et cetera, she could do something really powerful. However, I think Tiffany is her own worst enemy when it comes to this podcast. I am not sure if she thinks it\u2019s too much work, assumes she knows more than she does, or maybe the capacity isn\u2019t there to take on the extra work to be ethical, educational, and responsible. I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care at this point. We were outraged at how Crime Junkie handled plagiarism and stories about the people involved in their episodes, but I surprised there isn\u2019t more outrage about TR. honestly, even if buzzfeed or whatever wanted to write about the problems with this show, I\u2019d be happy to go on the record as a professional to cite issues, provide evidence based research to back my claims of how this podcast and TR is problematic. But until then, this is about as much as I feel safe talking about due to prior issues with TR.",

She\u2019ll happily describe people as narcissists and sociopaths with absolutely no diagnostic criteria provided, and she eagerly feeds into guests\u2019 assessments that follow a similar vein. As someone with a Cluster-B disorder myself, I was pretty upset by this and sent her an email asking her to either a) chill or b) actually do some research into what it\u2019s like to live with a Cluster-B disorder and how the vast majority of people with these diagnoses aren\u2019t abusers, but surprise surprise, no response + behavior continued. \n\nIn general, she gives very strong high school mean girl vibes. It really seems that more than telling victims\u2019 stories, wants to dunk on people whose behavior she disagrees with.",

People start being hyperbolic, drama ensues, harm gets blown way out of proportion, gossip hounds go nuts and people get pitchforks.\n\nI enjoyed the first and third season of SWW. Most of the other seasons I knew I was indulging in what was basically a gossip podcast. And now there is gossip drama around it. A lot of you are using words I don\u2019t think Tiffany even understands. And IMO your lofty sounding thesis statement to lay out a case about one podcast, makes me take you less seriously. It\u2019s not an epidemic. It\u2019s an exception that proves the rule that almost all TC podcasts don\u2019t have this problem.\n\nGo ahead and downvote me, go ahead and argue with me but all of this drama is easy enough to walk away from and is completely unsurprising. It\u2019s why I stay out of the websleuthing communities \u2014 too easy for things to get exaggerated and ugly.",

It\u2019s a great example of what a pod should not do.*\n\nBut the bigger problem is **people are getting hurt.** Someone posted stats recently that suggest as many as 150K listens a week. That\u2019s 150K people who are hearing potentially slanderous accusations toward the individuals targeted by the pod, individuals protected with often the thinnest of anonymity veil, if any at all. If it was you or someone you know targeted, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to walk away from. Especially since the pod seems to enable harassment of those it labels abusers. \n\nAgrguably worse yet, the pod mischaracterizes, mislabels, and grossly generalizes information about personality disorders and unhealthy relationships. With such a large platform, this misinformation has the potential to, and I think has, permeated the public consciousness. The reason the show doesn\u2019t include mental health professionals is because the content is inaccurate and frankly, unethical. Misinformation about narcissism, abuse, and victimhood affects how the people around us view and behave in relationships. It\u2019s socially and culturally dangerous. There\u2019s a comment on here from a professional who explains this better than I ever could.\n\nFinally, there have been attempts to silence all communication critical of the pod. The relatively-sanctioned Facebook group now even requires people to phrase their comments with specific language. If misinformation is being spread on a relatively large platform (high-ranking \u201ctrue crime\u201d podcast) and no one is allowed to talk about or question it, how would a listener find constructive dialogue and resources about abuse, mental disorders, and unhealthy relationships? It\u2019s valuable to have spaces to discuss topics as heavy as survivors and abuse, so I appreciate your comments here.",

One of my frustrations with these dialogues is people have already decided they don't want to have their minds changed and the less they can prove, the more they'll double down until it gets ridiculous. You have made me think more deeply about this issue.\n\nYou might have gleaned out of context that I was talking about Sword &amp; Scale. I still listen to Sword &amp; Scale if it's a case I don't know about. The drama got so polarizing I decided both sides were wrong, and that won. I also know about every fourth show he'll say something that irritates me. And I'm not above gossip and am amused with his feud with Invisible Choir. I know the two pods are not exactly analogous, but there are some core similarities IMO. I predict SWW going a S&amp;S route, where Tiffany doubles down and the pod is increasingly annexed until it's mainly basically groupies, they're just there for the whatever - muddling \"giving voice\" with gossip, etc. I'll concede there is more harm in that when it's couched as providing a voice to survivors. Some of this criticism feels similar to me to the S&amp;S drama when it was at its height, and now it's cordoned off and people don't seem to talk about it much (caveat: I'm only on Reddit no idea what I might be missing elsewhere.)\n\nAnd yes, unfortunately, probably witch hunts. That is distasteful and I'll concede harmful. I don't know much of what is going on with the Lexi stuff and I know I should if I'm going to pop off. I just am loathe to wade through hyperbole and even touch the mommy vlogger community (Years ago I belonged to an online community that got hacked when a breast feeding feud got out of control, so I can only imagine). I hope it goes to litigation, so I can read the legal documents in hope of at least some precise language. In my limited experience online feuds turned to suits don't get very far when the more extreme accusations have to be proven with evidence. Of course this case could be different.\n\nI stopped listening with the \"imposter syndrome\" season because I got sick and tired of the lack of self-awareness that is so often a part of SWW. And I also have a hunch, which I cannot prove of course, that Tiffany has had some compulsive liars on the pod and they've gotten more extreme. You are fluent in survivor dynamics and I'll also concede that is harmful, the problem with one-upping in abuse stories is that people can feel like their story of abuse isn't so bad and they feel even more guilty about sharing it.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: at what point is there some personal responsibility about what you choose to put in your earholes? This is the downside of a culture where anyone can publish anything. I go in knowing I'm listening to people without any bona fides. And I know that education and licensing isn't everything, there are plenty of amateurs that have good instincts. Tiffany isn't one of those people, she's trying to parlay \"giving voice\" to something deeper she's not qualified to be talking about given what is, IMO, a pretty sheltered life. I concede that point.\n\nBut IMO everyone should use what they hear in a podcast as a jumping off point to get information from more than one source.  I don't expect everyone to be like me, but I listen to podcasts partially to hone my critical thinking skills. It's a way to find some personal development in what is arguably an addiction. I don't think 150K listeners is permeating public consciousness. And I doubt all listeners of the pod are taking Tiffany as gospel.\n\nBut I do have to concede that there has been a lot of amateur psychoanalyzing going on in our culture for a while now. And there's a trend toward hyperbole that ranges from just personally irritating to me as a cranky middle-aged lady (so many people use \"terrified\" in their discourse I've learned to ask if they're actually terrified; or people defaulting to \"rude\" to describe behavior that is inconsiderate at best) to the more serious issue of people throwing clinical labels around. And I'll concede SWW is part of that problem.\n\nEdited: typos.",

Sounds like it\u2019s worth exploring [more drama \ud83d\ude29] even if only for wider context. \n\nAgree that SWW is not the only source for an ongoing social or cultural shift in perspectives on relationships and mental health. I mention the 150K listeners just to validate that it\u2019s a potential contributor and not completely insignificant. (And agree not all are fans, many are hatelistens!) But I think it\u2019s hard to ignore the uptick in people claiming \u201cvictimhood\u201d or nonchalantly labeling people they don\u2019t like as \u201cnarcissists\u201d or even \u201cpsycho/sociopaths\u201d in recent years. Personally I think this stems from a rise in true crime entertainment, higher focus on mental health during the pandemic, celebrity attention around mental health, and shows like Dirty John, SWW, etc that explore themes around unhealthy behavior and relationships (there are many other pods that should go here, I\u2019m blanking, maybe someone else can help).\n\nAlso agree with your comments about the host - and would suggest listeners who also have sheltered lives and/or backgrounds may be most vulnerable to accepting the misinformation perpetuated by SWW. But SWW also draws in listeners who have experienced abuse, and may still be in a vulnerable state or have PTSD or unresolved trauma. They may initially connect with the show thinking it is relevant and helpful to their experience, which as we all know is one of the best ways to get someone to quickly develop trust and adopt new ways of thinking (see: cults). So while the number of weekly listens may not be in the millions, the effects of the show can still be harmfully pervasive, especially when occurring in context with other shifting cultural paradigms. \n\nAt what point is there personal responsibility for what we listen to? Great question. Seems almost too much to ask people to objectively analyze the content they turn to for entertainment. This is a large topic I don\u2019t feel qualified to begin to tackle, but one can definitely start by dropping the shows that make you feel icky or promote harmful behaviors in yourself or others.\n\nEdit: a word",

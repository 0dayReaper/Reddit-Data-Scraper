Some of my favourite episodes include the paparazzi craze for Princess Diana\u2019s / the rise of reality tv / the rise of trashy daytime tv/ Jon Benet Ramsey/ grunge music / Woodstock / the 90\u2019s witch craze \n\nI love it. My explanation probably isn\u2019t doing the podcast justice but it\u2019s seriously good. Presented by one host and it\u2019s a really upbeat, nostalgic podcast",

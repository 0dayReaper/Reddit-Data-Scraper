    "postText": "I really like The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps and I was curious if there are other podcasts out there hosted by people with PhDs in their topic. I'd rather:\n\n\\-regular host(s) as the expert - I know there are a lot of podcasts that interview experts but that's not what I'm looking for; honestly, the fewer interviews the better\n\n\\-for academic interest rather than practical (e.g., not current events or self-help). I like history but I'd be happy to learn about other topics too\n\n\\-reasonably fun and entertaining to listen to (e.g., HoP can sometimes be kind of dry but the host is a good speaker and includes giraffe jokes)\n\nI'd appreciate any recommendations! The only other one I've listened to that kind-of-almost fits this description is Sawbones. Thanks!",

Both are good but the prehistory season is a must listen.  \n\nScientific odyssey - a physicist explores history of physics in a history of Rome style.  Excellent.  Very good story teller and really makes you understand how we came to understand the world. My second favorite podcast. \n\nLiterature and history - each episode the host summarizes a work of literature and discusses the historical context around it.  His starts in Bronze Age Mesopotamia and goes chronologically.  Currently he is in the late Roman era.   It is extremely informative and the host is a great storyteller and is very funny. My favorite podcast.  Host is a phd in English literature.\n\nSyzygy - astronomy podcast where they 2 hosts discuss a different topic each week. Both hosts have a phd I believe but one plays the layman.  Very funny and informative!\n\nBig biology - each week a different topic in biology is discussed. They like to explore the cutting edge and not so much the basics. \n\nMindscape - hosted by a phd physicist sean Carroll. Each week he interviews somebody on their work.  Topics include physics, biology, philosophy, math, and more. Very in depth conversations.",

            "comment": "Probable Causation - \"A show about law, economics, and crime\" hosted by a professor. It is mostly interviewing someone else who conducted a study (usually about the efficacy of some particular intervention), but the host is an expert, too, rather than a journalist. Maybe kind of dry for some, but I find it listenable while on the elliptical, which is my benchmark of not being too dry. \n\nParentData by Emily Oster - Econ professor discussing the intersection of economics and parenting. I'm not a parent, but as someone interested in health/economics/etc., I still find it interesting. The older episodes were just her reading her newsletter but were well-paced. Newer episodes do tend to have her interacting with someone else, but again, she's an expert, too. \n\nMinding the Brain - Hosted by professors. Not super dry, but not a personal favorite of mine for whatever reason (at least not yet). \n\nIpse Dixit - Host, who is a law professor (JD rather than PhD), discusses a law review article with the author. May not meet the criteria since it's an interview, but everyone involved is an expert, rather than being a journalist doing the interviewing. Episodes tend to vary in terms of how dry they are based on the topic of the law review article, but generally I'm a fan. I listen to a lot of legal podcasts, including ones hosted by legal academics, but this is one of the only ones that's consistently focused on academia rather than current events/cases. Obviously the particular articles may still be salient to current events, but the focus is seldom the most high-profile cases. \n\nThe National Security Law Podcast - Hosted by law professors (JDs). This one might be too current events-y for you (one of the hosts is a go-to commentator on many high-profile cases), but there are occasionally deep dives into more historical matters in national security law. Hosts have a good rapport, so it's not super dry.",

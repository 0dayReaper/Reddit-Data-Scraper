How long did it take you to sub to them, and have you cancelled any in the past?\n\nI'm currently a member of Patreons for Doughboys, DLC, and the Filmcast. Sometimes it's a little overwhelming to have twice as many episodes to get through with bonus content, but I think they put out really great stuff, so it's worth it for me.",

Each episode has an English and a Spanish version, hosted by different people, each telling the story from their side of the US/Mexico Border. It\u2019s enjoyable just from the English side though. The title is literal, because each episode ends with the verse of a Corrido about Chalino Sanchez composed for the show, and you hear the full version on the final episode.\n\nThe Coming Storm - a BBC reporter sees this weird guy in fur and horns at a Trump rally, and kind of blows him off. He sees him again at the Capitol rally and hears him referred to as \u201cThe QAnon Shaman\u201d. This leads him to trace the history and roots of QAnon - all the way back to \u201cThe Clinton Chronicles\u201d",

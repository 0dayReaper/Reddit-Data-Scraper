    "postText": "I remember a few months ago hearing a horror esk podcast, but can't remember the name. It wasn't strictly paranormal, as I remember one being about a man who got lost in the Arctic circle I think,  and it was his whole torturous journey trying to find his friend or find help or something. I think the name of the podcast was fairly short, and the narrator had a very deep voice. I know this isn't much to work with but any help is appreciated.\n\nEdit: This podcast doesn't have guests or anything. It is one guy narrating a story, and it is not a documentary. Purely fiction.",

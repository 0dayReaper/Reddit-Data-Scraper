    "postText": "I used to be absolutely obsessed with true crime - Casefile was my go to, but I listened to long-form podcasts like Serial that discuss murder and rape as well. Then a true crime happened in the family of one of my closest friends, and watching the fallout in the family and the absolutely predatory internet reaction made me sick. Now I can\u2019t get through even 10 minutes of any episode that talks about that stuff, but the itch is still there to hear about mysteries and solutions.\n\nSome podcasts I like that have scratched the itch:\n\nLost Boys (Chameleon) - an intriguing story with no murder\n\nDark Net Diaries - I LOVE this one so much and there\u2019s a huge backlog of episodes. Hackers and cybercrime! With Jack! Who is so nice. I also love that he has actual conversations with the hackers involved.\n\nAmerican Scandal - Another one with a huge backlog. The most recent season was a three part series about the Cash for Kids scandal, but they\u2019ve also done a season on the Cuban Missile Crisis and other really varied and interesting topics\n\nCrimetown - This one has SOME murder maybe, but they also interview old mobsters and it\u2019s very interesting listen.\n\nCriminal - Phoebe usually picks crimes that are less about the crime and more about the fallout of the crime and the impact on people which is more interesting to me anyway these days.\n\nAre there others? Has anyone else found themselves losing the ability to listen to true crime over the years?\n\nEdit: Guys, you are incredible. I've made a list of everything recommended in this thread below.

It is incredibly easy to loose sight of humanity when profiting off of others grief/ tragedy. The one true crime podcast I could ever stand to listen to is Truer Crime because the person talking about the crimes came from a place of compassion and highlighting the humanity. I also see the good in covering missing person cases and that type of thing to bring awareness. But a lot of the time the oversaturated market of true crime seems to prioritize the sensation of it all.",

I\u2019m not a podcast person, except for a few, which I\u2019ll name later, but I\u2019m a huge believer in pushing ethical true crime creators (and content) that actually take the families into account and allow them to tell their own stories. I say that because there was a case that affected my family a few decades ago, and to this day, we\u2019re terrified of some random podcaster finding the old newspaper articles and making content on it without our knowledge or consent. \n\nI\u2019ve connected with a few other families who\u2019ve been affected by notable cases that have been or could be exploited, and I think it\u2019s really empowering to have that sense of community. The podcasters that I think deserve more recognition are ones that are created by survivors and/or families of actual cases - like Sarah Turney, Melissa Moore, and Collier Landry\u2019s podcasts. It\u2019s sad that people like this have often felt coerced into doing their own podcasts because of having their own (or their family\u2019s) cases exploited, but I think it helps hold the true crime community more accountable for the BS.",

Not trying to go gimlet heavy but reply all had some really fun and interesting, light harmless, true crime episodes.  Deep cover is really good.  Somebody suggested rise and fall of mars hill.  That was great show.  Cheat! Is good.  I really like cautionary tales with tim Hartford.  All those shows have a hint of true crime to them.  Or mystery solving.  And they all have great production.",

Radio Rental season 1 for same (gets rubbish by s02). I am trying to find more shows like this because I like scary but I don't want to hear about people dying if possible. \n\nTwin Flames is a mental one about a dating cult, really good, no one dies.",

It really made me think more about victims and those affected in true crime podcasts more but hasn\u2019t stopped me from listening.",

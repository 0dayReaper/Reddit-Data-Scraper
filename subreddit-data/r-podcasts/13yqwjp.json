    "postText": "I am hoping to find a podcast that is entertaining but provides a wide range of coverage about all things NFL. Player moves/coaching hires/off-the-field news, etc. I feel like a lot of this has moved to Twitter and most NFL podcasts assume their listeners have already heard the news of the day and just want to hear people reacting to it. Any good ones out there?",

They have great chemistry and always a laugh.\n\nBy Jason Bell and osi umenyiora.\n\nNot sure how big their media presence actually is in the usa (I know they are famous ex players, but I'm guessing there are tonnes of ex players in the media there) but in the UK they are pretty much the main guys for nfl coverage.\n\nWould be interesting to know actually. Are they as big in USA nfl media as they are here? Or is it big fish in a small pond? Either way, they're great.",

Now, all the corporate bullshit has entered the space, just like every other existing space of our lives. \n\nIt\u2019s very sad. Reminds me of that STP lyric from Vasoline: \u201cone time a thing occurred to me, what\u2019s real and whats for sale?\u201d \n\nGood luck in your quest.

CBC (Canada), ABC (Australia), RNZ (New Zealand) and RT\u00c9 (Ireland) are all ad-free (at least the podcasts I have listened to). All 5 have a very wide variety of podcasts, so you're certain to find something interesting!\n\nEdit: If you have Amazon Music (bundled with Prime subscriptions in my country), you can listen to all Wondery Podcasts ad-free! You do have to listen on the Amazon Music app, which is not ideal - but at least it's totally ad-free with no added costs.",

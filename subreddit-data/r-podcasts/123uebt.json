I\u2019m trying to stay away from self-improvement type podcasts because those sometimes have an adverse affect if I\u2019m not in the right headspace.\n\nI hope this helps explain what I mean and I appreciate any recommendations you have to offer!",

Gameshow comedy format from NPR. Usually makes me laugh. \n\nNo Stupid Questions \u2014 another favorite. A psychologist and economist take on listener questions about various topics.

I loved Malevolent from the first episode, which is a bit of a surprise since it usually takes me a couple of episodes to really get invested in a show.\n\nNow that I'm left waiting for some new content there, I've been searching for a new show to listen to in the same vein. I just started the Magnus Archives, which seems intriguing, but are there any other shows you would recommend?",

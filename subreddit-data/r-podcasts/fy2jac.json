Something the equivalent of feeling like you\u2019re bingeing a TV show and you\u2019ve got to watch the next episode. Can be a one-off like Reply-All or an episode that is worth of a listen. But also looking for a longer form\n\nPodcasts I\u2019ve recently listened to that I\u2019ve dug: Radio Rental, S Town, Reply All (missing hit is phenomenal)\n\nThanks in advance!",

That particular stretch of road down Route 28 is pretty creepy in general. There isn't much around. A few scattered houses, really trashy trailer parks, and a scary run down RV park down by the river, the entirety of which is covered in pine needles. \n\nA murder also took place at my grandmother's house before she, my grandfather, my mom and aunts all moved in in the 70s. The story is that at the time when the previous family lived there, the murderer hid in the attic until everyone was asleep and then came down through the attic door and killed their little girl in her bed. \n\nThat room is now my grandmother's. Her bed is under that attic door except now there is a slide lock on the outside. Just one of the things that's creepy AF about Gram's house. When she goes away and I come over to feed the cats, I try to only come during the daylight hours. The whole house is creaky and weird with one really long hallway down to that bedroom.",

Cold is so good because I felt like I already knew so much about the case but the podcast goes into sooo much more. Probably because you get to hear audio/written journal entries from the main players involved. It's crazy how many people actually keep journals like this, it was just fitting for this case. Definitely makes the podcast for me. It's an excellent deep dive that covers this case from top to bottom and really gets you into the minds of people in the case. My only complaint about Cold is how it kind of ignores the Mormon aspect to the case. But it's definitely my favorite podcast  that focuses on a single case.",

Early on we learn that Chris (and some other teachers around Sydney) had a habit of grooming young students. Chris had an affair with one of his students, Joanne Curtis. The premise is that Lynn disappears never to be found again--the ties that Chris had with NSW police seem questionable and his own reaction to the occurrence is less than satisfactory. He goes on to marry Joanne and they start a family of their own while Lynne remains missing. There's a lot of compelling evidence that makes you wonder why and how this happened. \n\nOverall, it was such a good podcast that I binged it and couldn't wait for some free time in my day so I could continue listening to it--really well done journalism.",

It is a masterpiece.\n\nIt\u2019s about the murder of a French woman, Sophie Toscan du Plantier who was bludgeoned to death outside her countryside home in a very remote part of West Cork in Ireland. It was one of the only recorded murders in the area and the police botched the case. The main murder suspect still lives in the area, and features heavily in the podcast, it really gives an insight into what a grandiose narcissist looks like, the instability of his personality, but also the local culture of the town and what the murder did to the locals there, and other strange misfits and characters that come into play, and their motives in the case. \n\nIt is completely gripping, completely compelling. It\u2019s the best podcast I\u2019ve listened to to date. It surpasses Serial by far, but is in that same vein. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

In order from best to still good but my personal preference. All of these are factional stories. They are very much like watching a TV show or movie with your eyes closed and very addicting. I used to get home from work where I\u2019d listen to them (I did landscaping) and just sit in a dark room listening because I had to know what happens next. Hope this is what you\u2019re looking for.",

Great and very funny (which can be a help now). \nMy favorite is - Sparks Nevada! Marshall on Mars!   \nHope you find things that keep you engaged.  Stay home stay safe out there",

    "postText": "Can anyone recommend podcasts relating to nuclear weapons developments during the Cold War and the Department of Labors efforts to investigate the harmful effects of exposure? Miamisburg Mound in Ohio was cleaned\n in 2003 but there are still water vapor tests being done and former employees have presented with numerous cases of cancer and neurological disorders.  I find these types of things fascinating as they not only effect the former workers, but continue to effect the surround community. Thanks!",

It has a second season, but that was mostly about spying between Russia and US.\n\nI know there was one that was about the aftermath of the Bikini Atoll population, but I can't remember the name of that one. It might have been a single episode.\n\nThere was another called The Cold War. That was mostly a history of Soviet US relations. Nuclear arsenal played a big part in the history, but that wasn't the focus of the show.",

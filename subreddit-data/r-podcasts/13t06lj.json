    "postText": "I am looking for a podcast episode. It is an guest/interview-style show. The host and the guest were both women in this instance. The guest was invited to talk about the importance of women and storytelling\u2014how history might look different if it were told from a woman\u2019s perspective. The guest was also discussing her recent work or book about the retelling of the story of Eve from a feminist perspective: That from a different lens, Eve could be a story about desire and a woman owning her sexuality.\n\n \nDo you know which podcast this description could be from?",

It's two women talking about author Angela Carter who is \"known for her feminist, gothic, and erotic sensibilities and for re-inventing folk and fairy tales\". The book is called \"The Passion of New Eve\". \n\nOr if you're sure it's about the Biblical Eve, it could be [The Old Pros](https://oldprosonline.org/lilith/). It's a little series about Lilith: \n\n&gt;The story of Eve tempting Adam in the Garden of Eden is a patriarchal fairy tale that most of us learn at an early age. But Eve wasn\u2019t the first wife or the first woman. Her predecessor, Lilith, was the first \u201cfallen woman\u201d who refused to submit to her husband and openly enjoyed sex for pleasure.",

I listened to a great ep recently about Sabrina Spielrein. Here's the blurb:\n\n'Sabina Spielrein was one of the first female psychoanalysts, \u201cinvented\u201d child psychology, and innovated some of the most famous concepts now attributed to Jung and Freud.'",

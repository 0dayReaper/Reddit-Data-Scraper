How is that even possible?\n\nPeople who are transparent about their partisan biases are going to be far more objective than those who hide them. On the center-left, I would recommend the Josh Marshall podcast. The analysis is quite good and while they are clearly anti-Trump the commentary is always grounded in reality.",

It usually came from the selection of stories they decided to cover, as in they really wouldn't report any stories that painted conservatives in a good light.  And you can say, \"Well yeah but that's because the GOP went crazy in 2016,\" and you may be right but that doesn't change the fact that it promoted an anti-conservative bias.\n\nI didn't mind it as a liberal, though, but I don't get how people can't see it.  Also, literally everyone does it now, so to ask them to be unbiased would be a bit ridiculous.  When the country's politics become too divided, unbiased reporting becomes a no man's land that's impossible to live in.\n\nEdit: Shoutout to Car Talk, a show that somehow is one of the best podcasts there is even today, despite the whole show being made for radio and before podcasts existed.",

Most people have shut off half the country as being politically unreasonable and as such they no longer try to see things from their perspective (or think they have them figured out in an insulting way).  Even if this is understandable, unwillingness to see things from all perspective creates bias.  This bias as I said before, is completely reasonable when one side presents themselves in a radical and polarizing way.  This is why I am a liberal, like I also said before.\n\nYou can be biased to science and rational thought.  To think science or your side is neutral is textbook bias and exactly how many places become fundamentalist regimes who take power even though the vast majority of people write them off as religious nut jobs (think Iran).",

I recommend it to everyone I feel comfortable talking politics with, def helped me a lot to become more aware of other viewpoints and generally turn down the temperature of political debate/nonsense.\n\nhttps://www.readtangle.com/",

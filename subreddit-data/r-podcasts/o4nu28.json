    "postText": "I\u2019m gonna tell the truth and shame the devil as my country cousins say. I didn\u2019t realize how much I had issues with gay couples until I started hearing a ton of horror stories with gay couples, both male and female. I thought I was an accepting \u201cif it exists then it\u2019s normal\u201d kind of dude, but when I first heard a story that featured a gay couple I had a small nagging feeling that said \u201chey\u2026 this ain\u2019t normal man.\u201d Which is obviously bullshit. But I don\u2019t wanna judge 4 years ago me. But now when I hear it i don\u2019t even bat an eye. So thank you no sleep podcast, mr creepypasta and creeps mcpasta for helping me normalize same sex relationships. I know it may sound strange but that shit matters. Because a loving consenting relationship is a loving consenting relationship, regardless of the gender or preference of the carbon-based entities in the relationship.",

I had no words for what Louis and Lestat were to each other, but I saw it clear as day.\n\nThis was all back in the 90s, when I was just starting to hear and see this stuff on TV.

In general, many of these podcasts overlap with the stories so you may hear one or more of them on multiple podcasts, but all in all they\u2019re pretty solid podcasts. Personally I\u2019m partial to the first fifteen episodes of Creepy, where they get into a lot of urban legend type stuff (secret rooms at Disney, haunted video games, etc.). That\u2019s just my personal preference because I love urban legends. As far as the nosleep podcast, you can find polls on Reddit that will tell you what people\u2019s favorites are. I love butter street hitchhiker, my pet monster and Whitefall to name a few.\n\nLast but certainly not least, two of the nosleep stories have their own separate podcasts, and I like both:\n\nThe Left-Right Game and Borrasca",

I realized I had a snag that I\u2019d never noticed before. \n\nEmpathy allows me to \u201cbe more accepting of criminals and abusive parents because they have had horrible lives that have led them to that decision and instead of judging them I empathize, though I do not approve.\u201d  I generally associate empathy with something people choose, and/ or something bad or depressing, and not with people being born the way they are.\n\nI never associated that with the homosexual/ trans/ bi/ queer community. I\u2019m not \u201ctolerant of those who identify differently because they had a horrible life that led them to that decision.\u201d I am learning to accept that not everyone is like me, and - as long as their lifestyle isn\u2019t immediately harmful to others - I\u2019m good with it! And that is what these podcasts helped me with\n\nEdit: by \u201charmful to others\u201d I mean endangering lives in some way (rape, murder, etc.)",

The host, Stephen, visits haunted locations in and around Austin, Texas, usually bars, hotels, farms, and occasionally homes. It's just the right amount of earnest and skeptical, with research about the history, interviews with locals, and sessions with Sara, a clairvoyant who explores the locations. They compare the legends and the historical info to piece together what's going on. It's amazing.\n\nI second the Danny Robbins podcasts (Uncanny, Haunted, Battersea Poltergeist), &amp; Spooked. You Can See Me in the Dark is a good indie podcast with people telling their own scary stories.",

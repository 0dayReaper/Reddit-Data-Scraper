    "postText": "Hello r/Podcasts,\n\nI was hoping that someone here may know of an app or a hack with existing sorting options to make the following work: I\u2019d like to have a group of podcasts sorted from oldest to newest but in alternating order, let me explain further!\n\nTypical oldest to newest sorting will obviously act as follows:\n\n1.\tPodcast A, released 1 June 2020\n2.\tPodcast A, released 8 June 2020\n3.\tPodcast A, released 15 June 2020\n4.\tPodcast B, released 22 June 2020\n5.\tPodcast B, released 29 June 2020\n6.\tPodcast B, released 6 July 2020\n7.\tPodcast C, released 13 July 2020\n8.\tPodcast C, released 20 July 2020\n9.\tPodcast C, released 27 July 2020\n\nWhat I'd like to be able to do is:\n\n1.\tPodcast A, released 1 June 2020\n2.\tPodcast B, released 22 June 2020\n3.\tPodcast C, released 13 July 2020\n4.\tPodcast A, released 8 June 2020\n5.\tPodcast B, released 29 June 2020\n6.\tPodcast C, released 20 July 2020\n7.\tPodcast A, released 15 June 2020\n8.\tPodcast B, released 6 July 2020\n9.\tPodcast C, released 27 July 2020\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s much of an appetite for something like this from other people but does anyone know if this is possible in any app at all? I\u2019m on iPhone as well, if that helps!\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Just realised, I didn\u2019t specify that I\u2019d like for this to be done automatically, not for me to manually add them to a list or reorder them myself!",

    "postText": "I listened to a podcast a few years ago that I am trying to find again but cannot remember the name or who made it. It was a 5-15 minute news blurb for every day leading up to World War 1 from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to the outbreak of war.\n\nIf I remember correctly the host was doing it on an anniversary of the war and was releasing the episodes daily (ie \"on this day in 1914...\"). I believe it was a series within a larger history podcast that I was listening through the back catalog of.\n\nIt was a series that really stuck with me and I think back to every once in a while. I was telling a history buff friend about it and he asked me to send it to him, but now I cannot remember who/what it was from. Does that sound familiar to anyone?",

            "comment": "Everything you're describing sounds like The Great War YouTube series. The episodes detailed what was happening that week 100 years prior and carried a lot of, \"On this day in 1914...\" synopses. There may be a podcast form of the video series that I'm unaware of, that just sounds so on the nose for that series and if nothing else, for those interested you could just listen to the youtube series as a podcast anyways.",

It certainly fits the format, since it consists of daily 5-10 min news blurbs about that day in WW1 starting from the day before Franz Ferdinand's assassination and continuing up to the end of 1914.\n\nOtherwise check out [The Great War](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2vhKMBjSxO1lsrC98VOyOzfW0Gn8Tga) on YouTube, which covers the entirety of WW1 on a week by week basis.\n\nOtherwise the only WW1 podcast I can think of is the [Blueprint for Armageddon](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-55-blueprint-for-armageddon-series/) series from Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, which covers the buildup and initial fallout of the war in pretty extreme detail.",

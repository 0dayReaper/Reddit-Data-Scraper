It's mainly from a research perspective but a lot of the featured research and projects are based on inputs directly from the recipients.",

Links included lead to the eps on Spotify. \n\nInternational global health &amp; aid isn't the focus of the overall podcast (though they do also talk a lot about more local public health policies in the US), but these two eps really are stand outs for me :)",

I don't want to hear about fictional events that could've happened, I want something about what made it haunted in the first place! Any suggestions?",

            "comment": "Knock Once For Yes might be a good fit. Their episodes typically have 3 sections, starting off with paranormal news stories, then they share some listener stories, and the final part of the episode is what you'd enjoy, the \"Paranormal Postcard\". This is where they discuss the hauntings of a place, and they research the specific historical events that happened there which could explain the haunting, and they share their experiences from visiting the location. Sometimes they do interviews instead of paranormal postcards but that can still be interesting as you discover new creators to listen to.",

    "postText": "I am partial to one-story podcasts particularly on long drives. There are so many great stories out there but I find that many podcasts stretch them out unnecessarily, both in terms of length of episode and number of episodes. Often this includes adding episodes even after the big reveal. Is this the plan all along? Do they just keep going once it gets popular? I guess some people like follow up episodes even if they provide no new information? \n\nI don't mind multiple episodes when they remain engaging but, in my opinion, they almost never do. Does it all come down to money?",

            "comment": "As someone who works in this industry creating narrative podcasts, resources and financials are the main reason stories are dragged out. Podcast development resources, and generally development teams, are small. Particularly if you are creating an \u201calways on\u201d series (as in runs 52 weeks in the year), you need to maximise feasibility, even if it doesn\u2019t necessary serve the narrative best. When we pitch limited series, we\u2019re even asked to start at 8 episodes - just to prove there\u2019s enough weight and content in the story",

And this includes Mike Duncan's last season of *Revolutions*, which went over 100 episodes. However most podcasts I listen to aren't in the business of creating tension to work towards a big reveal - they're here documenting every twist and turn of a journey we all know the end point of. So maybe we are listening to very different things! Which podcasts *did* you feel have this problem of releasing episodes with no new information?",

I enjoyed the story but it was done by episode 7 and had 5 (!) more. \n\nOthers that come to kind are Cold and Somebody Knows Something. \n\nI listen mostly to true crime so once we know who did it and/or why, all the follow ups and recaps don't seem to add anything.",

But for these \"criminal investigation\" type of podcasts, I think follow ups make sense - a lot of their audience would want to know if the case got to trial/if the offender was brought to justice/if *anything* changed. So making an episode, even if it's just to say \"nothing has changed, the survivors/family are still looking for justice\" might make sense. \n\nAlso, these are Wondery podcasts - so I'm sure monetary considerations are in play, lol.\n\nEdit - If you haven't already, maybe check out true crime podcasts that are not structured as an active investigation? Some of my favourites are [The Assassination](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05r6cgx/episodes/downloads) (investigates the assassination of Benzair Bhutto), [The Lazarus Heist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtvg9/episodes/downloads), Season 1 (Bangladesh Bank heist, allegedly by the North Korean state), [The Agent](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agent/id1587714169) (first person account of a Soviet sleeper agent), [Good Assassins](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-assassins/id1558899516), Season 1 (an account of an alleged Mossad assassination) and [Bed of Lies](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/bed-of-lies/), Season 1 (an account of British undercover operations, against left wing environmental groups)",

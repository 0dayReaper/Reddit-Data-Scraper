    "postText": "I just moved to iPhone after years on android. I use Podcast Addict on android, and I love the sleep timer because when I fall asleep I don't want to wake up with it still playing 10 episodes later. Podcast Addict has 2 key features that I find essential, and I'd like to find in an iOS app. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Setting the player to use the sleep timer by default. I like to not have to set the timer every night\n2. Shake to extend timer. Sometimes I'm not asleep yet when the timer runs out. I like being able to shake my phone to extend the timer and not have to unlock the phone and manually set the timer again. \n\nIs there any iOS app with both of these features? Bonus points if it has a \"Mark older episodes as played\" function.",

You can also mark older episodes as played. \n\nPerhaps worth having a quick look yourself to see if ticks the boxes.",

You can also set a fix time or fire the sleep timer after current episode finishes.\n\nShake to extend the timer works for the Android version of Podcast Republic, but not in the iOS version. On iOS, shake doesn't work if the app is in the background.",

So no need to unlock and set the timer again.",

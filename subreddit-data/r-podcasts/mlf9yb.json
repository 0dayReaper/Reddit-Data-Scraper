    "postText": "After discovering one or two good podcasts I found myself getting into really cool show concepts, mostly informational, but all across the board too. My problem, is the ones I started with have all gotten somewhat stale or annoying, solely because I become so familiar with their structure, mannerisms, and presentation. Its like they gain a sense of predictability. \n\n\nI started branching out more to newer casts, but they all seem to go down that route, and im noticing that im getting to that point faster and faster with each new one. Its like they all start to sound the same to me. It can be an inflection that they use, or one word they say too much or pronounce weird, or even just that their subjects are overdone, I cant seem to get around the fact that I get annoyed eventually. \n\n\nAre podcasts becoming something that isnt for me? Is there a way to stop, or at least slow this progression? I drive a lot for work and I love learning stuff, so I have become kinda dependent upon them to stay focused more easily, but they are losing effectiveness.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem?",

I intersperse the two to mitigate the exact burnout you describe. \n\nA lot of libraries have programs where you can digitally check out audiobooks for free if you don\u2019t want to give money to Audible (Scamazon).",

I also tend to alternate between audiobooks and podcasts, and... this is the first time I'm putting it into words, but I feel like podcasts require more social attention, and audiobooks require more mental attention. Podcasts often have at least two hosts (or host and guest) and tend to involve back-and-forth, but also tend to give information at a measured pace. Audiobooks are a relief in a way because it's just one person reading a single thing, but that single thing can require some intense attention to follow along.",

I also listen to 5-6 different genres of podcasts. Variety definitely helps.\n\nETA: I also have a few shows I\u2019m not subscribed to but check out ever so often to see if they\u2019ve uploaded anything that interests me. Those are mostly interview style podcasts like arm chair expert, smartless, producers guide, and A24. I don\u2019t care about every guest but every now and then I find a gem.\n\nALSO it\u2019s okay to give up on a show if you just aren\u2019t feeling it. I delete shows every now and then if I\u2019m not into it, but if I delete a show I find a new replacement. The quality of your time is important.",

It can be an inflection that they use, or one word they say too much or pronounce weird, or even just that their subjects are overdone. I can\u2019t seem to get around the fact that I get annoyed eventually. \n\n&gt;Are podcasts becoming something that isn\u2019t for me?\n\nAre you listening to just one type of podcast, and getting annoyed by the same old tropes? (If it\u2019s true crime podcasts, listen to one of the parodies which skewer the tropes so well, like The Onion\u2019s *A Very Fatal Murder* or *Done Disappeared* or *This Sounds Serious*.)\n\nI subscribe to a few different kinds of podcasts, so I can mix it up according to my mood. I like a 50-year-old soap opera called *The Archers*. (And I discovered r/Ambridge, where there are others who listen, because no one I know IRL does.) It\u2019s like comfort food, or a guilty pleasure.\n\nI like a podcast that make me laugh. (So glad *My Dad Wrote a Porno* is starting book six.) And a brand new podcast where I have to wait a week between episodes (like *Killer Role* from *Dateline NBC*\u2019s Keith Morrison) really helps any boredom or burnout.\n\nI \u201ctest drive\u201d new podcasts that I hear about on Reddit or are advertised on my other podcasts. Sometimes it\u2019s something I never would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d enjoy, like *In Plain Sight: Lady Bird Johnson* about the former US First Lady. Or *The Battersea Poltergeist* about alleged supernatural activity in south-west London in 1965.\n\nTl;dr Perhaps try mixing it up a little?",

Im glad to know I'm not the only one. \n\nSomeone else recommended audiobooks which I may just do, I think they would offer me that change that I may be wanting. Also ill probably \"test drive\" some of the ones you recommended above, so thanks!",

Seasons 2-4 are phenomenal and I've had a few friends start season 2 and not like it at first, later tell me its the most eye-opening podcast they've ever heard. It's focuses on US history that shaped US based ideas of race, identity, gender and democracy.\n\n&gt;my favorite is psychology\n\nI'd also highly recommend Weird Studies, which labels itself as an arts and philosophy podcast by a music prof and filmmaker, but they get into some wonderful discussions on TV, film, psychology, etc. A good one to start with is the [episode on Stranger Things i](https://www.weirdstudies.com/50)f you've already seen it, but they're episodes on [Jung](https://www.weirdstudies.com/73), [Nietsche](https://www.weirdstudies.com/49), [Macluhan](https://www.weirdstudies.com/71#:~:text=On%20the%20surface%2C%20the%20phrase,less%20important%20than%20its%20form), Freud and others are amazing as well even if you're not familiar with them like me. I'd add that they are very balanced in their opinions and their opinions of those people and their flaws.",

At first it was mostly great information with some decently funny humor here and there, but now it seems that maybe 1/3 of the episodes are actually about the topic and the rest is nothing but fake info (did you believe me, I hope someone believed me hahahaha),  really really annoying repeated \"jokes\" (like just saying \"wanna smoke some crack\" in a high pitched voice 10+ times in an episode), or inside jokes that were kind of funny but probably should have been dropped after a couple episodes.  \n\nDoes it ever return to form or does it just stay like this?\n\nI loved the earlier episodes but have considered giving up on it altogether over the past couple episodes.  It's gotten to the point that the second I hear something interesting or surprising, I pretty much tune out and expect it",

I will listen to educational podcasts and get tired of their structure, so I switch to DnD podcasts which are totally different. Try branching out, by listening to a completely different genre that you might not think that you'd like. That's how I have found a lot of great podcast",

Disclaimer: i'm an author of a new podcast concept that just launched - and while trying to figure out a tone and subject matter for the show, I had a couple of thoughts from listening to the casts out there:\n\n1) there's generally the BBC/NPR tradition of neatly produced and written shows, that are very well structured and clear, and then there's the more informal conversational shows that we enjoy for the feeling they provide of having banter in your kitchen when you're alone and focused on another task at hand. \n\n2) Most shows are generally theme/niche subject driven - which is naturally helpful if you have an area of interest specifically that you're wanting to explore more of, but if you're a casual listener and want to be surprised in conversation (the way real life conversation with interesting people is often meandering and sometimes going off on interesting tangents), there's not much in the way of shows that provide both depth and variety. The trouble with niche expertise is that we often already have a set view of what subjects we're interested in, so we're not likely to explore something we have some conscious or subconscious bias against, for whatever the reason. As such we're less likely to be surprised. \n\nI wanted to create a show that would address both these limiting notions of what a podcast could be like, and have just launched it this week :) \nDaydreaming Sensei Podcast is a show about discovering the surprising and often hidden connections between subjects that may seem to be unconnected, so as to help us make sense of this perplexing era we're all in. I'd love for you guys to check it out and let me know what you think by leaving a review or sharing with someone if you enjoyed! xx     \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daydreaming-sensei-podcast/id1561574145?uo=4\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/3ZJvaz3XcrPf4axNPoOjpO\n\nhttps://anchor.fm/daydreamingsensei",

Most podcasters aren\u2019t really ambitious and already have achieved more success than they expected so don\u2019t change the formula. Or the ambitious ones don\u2019t have the content and/or talent.",

Even in a pretty varied show, you can't help the fact that presenters have a limited way to filter things and responses to things. And, if you're putting out 50 hours of content a year over multiple years, that will likely be super familiar and a fun in joke for a while, until it starts to feel a bit stale. \n\nWould love to hear of podcasts that have switched it up or managed to avoid that.",

    "postText": "I'm searching for a good *podcast cataloging site*, maybe you guys have some recommendations. I'm not searching for a podcast listening app which streams the episodes, although won't mind it if it does.\n\nMost importantly to me, it should have stats like total minutes listened (based on the episodes I marked as listened, not the actually time I spent listening), number of listened episodes, ...  It should be possible to create lists, and better yet, has tags like \"listened\", \"want to listen\", \"dropped\", ...\n\nI'm currently using Podchaser, which does a pretty good job. My problems with it are the unprecise stat on listening time (e.g. \"3 months, 2 weeks\") and the many bugs this site has (the same episode appears multiple times, some links are redirected to \"sorry, site does not exist\", ...). I think Pocketcast does not increase listening time if I mark episodes as played.\n\n---\n\nAs reference, good sites I have in mind for other media:\n+ [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) (books)\n+ [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) (Anime)\n+ [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) (East Asian TV shows)\n+ [Simkl](https://simkl.com/) (movies, TV series)",

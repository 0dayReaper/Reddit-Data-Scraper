    "postText": "It's kind of hard to explain what it's about except for two people going on night walks seperately and then writing letters to each other about it. They plan to do this every night for two weeks.   \nI'm only on the first episode but it is so beautiful and calm. I love Bianca and Terry and how they interact. There's a line that sums up their differences so nicely: \"Terry promises that this will bring them closer to God. Bianca has doubts.\" I never re-listen to episodes but I feel so inspired after listening that I think I'm going to need to.   \n\n\nWhat is this genre of podcast? I've never heard of The Believer magazine. Are there any other pods that are similar?",

They are still worth a listen though.\n\nThe Wind, The Organist (KCRW with The Believer), The 11th, Third Coast Audio Festival's Resound, and Hearing Voices. I know there are a few others, but can't remember the names right now. \n\nhttps://transom.org/tag/slow-radio/",

This is not a thread to promote your podcast **nor is it a place to rant about things about podcasts that annoy you - these comments will be removed.**\n\nAlso, please check out our wiki info pages including [listener FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/faqs1) and our [list of other podcasting subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/podcastsubreddits).

If not, please feel free to submit all frequently asked questions (FAQs) here.\n\nIndividual FAQ posts will be removed and users will be directed to post their question here in this thread. Be as specific as possible - \"looking for a new podcast\" is a bit broad.\n\nIf you are helping / answering a question, be polite and not condescending.

I have been listening to too much true crime podcasts the last couple of days and I need to take a break. I'm having panic attacks while trying to sleep, thinking someone's gonna break in, so I really need to avoid these types of podcasts for the time being. I'm a nerd, so nerdy ones would be appreciated.",

Just three people who bring in people with an interesting perspective and have a conversation (mostly about movies and tv, but here about the whole bud light kerfluffed). \n\nIt may be that my comfort with the format is because I\u2019m Gen X and these are elder milleniels having a thoughtful conversation.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m endlessly fascinated with the music and art of that era so I can offer some niche podcasts:\n\nDeath Of An Artist \u2014 dense podcast about the 1985 death of a female artist in the context of the NY art scene, gender, race, etc. Hosted by an insider.\n\nWhat Had Happened Was - Prince Paul Season \n\nTangential but still an interesting podcast - Ballad of Billy Balls, about the impact of a murder of a musician in the punk scene on a mother and daughter. Wish there was more content about that aspect but still interesting and eye witness account of being a kid in NYC in the 80s. \n\nDocumentary \u2014 Blank City (it\u2019s on Tubi)\n\nAny podcast about the birth of hip-hop that is worth its salt will get into the history of NYC, it\u2019s very tied to politics. South Bronx was effectively cut off from the world via city planning and music funding was cut in schools. Ditto anything re the Guardian Angels.\n\nStuff You Should Know has an episode called Behind the Red Beret. Unfortunately their style doesn\u2019t work for me but they\u2019re recommended a lot so putting it on your radar. \n\nAnything that gets into city planning will probably involve the history of NYC, I found this searching and plan to listen today. Thanks for the prompt:\n\nhttps://radiopublic.com/light-cities-and-architecture-des-69DR5p\n\nThey have an episode specifically about NYC\n\nTalk to Me - about the formation of the NYPD hostage negotiation unit. Fascinating details about what was going on in the late sixties-seventies in NYC.\n\nDovetailing with that - Mother Country Radicals, about the Weather Underground host is the son of two fugitives, lots of eye witness accounts of being in NYC",

                    "comment": "Stuff you should know is sooooo poorly researched (or at least it was when I tried listening to it.) I also find the hosts annoying. \n\nI second Death of an Artist, it was well done and compelling! \n\n- The Shrink Next Door tangentially NYC related. A man who owns a textile factory has his life taken over by his shrink. And it\u2019s a true story. \n\n- Long Shadow first season is about the lead up to 9/11 and really well done. \n\n- Articles of Interest (their series on American Ivy/ Prep) goes into the rise of preppy style and it\u2019s street style influences in the 80s/90s. Sooooo good. \n\nThe Bowery boys are amazing and I have yet to find anything else quite like it. I wish someone would make a similar format for London or LA.",

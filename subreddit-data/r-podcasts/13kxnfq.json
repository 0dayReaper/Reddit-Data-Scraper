Cat is a doctor of archaeology, I'm not sure about Matt, only that he has studied history.\n\nHalf-arsed History's host Riley Knight is also a historian, I think he has a B.A. in history.\n\nOne of the hosts of Empire, William Dalrymple, is also a historian (his co-host is Anita Anand, a reporter who has also written about historical topics)\n\nThe host of You're Dead To Me has an MA in history, the guests are always a comedian and an expert on the episodes topic, who usually have a history degree and quite often teach history.\n\nAnd while In Our Time is not hosted by a historian, it's always a panel discussion between academics. There's a lot of history episodes, but they also cover some other areas. e.g. science.\n\nFor a science podcast I'd recommend The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry, hosted by Dr. Adam Rutherford and Prof. Hannah Fry",

    "postText": "Few months back I made a post here asking for podcast suggestions that could help me go through one of the most stressful time of my life so far, dealing with my mother\u2019s 4th stage brain tumor fight. Sadly,I lost my mom to cancer and she is no more. During this whole time, when I had to sit beside her in the hospital I used to check my previous post and listen to your recommended podcasts. I swear to God, most of the recommended pod casts actually helped me. Listening to a few awful stories from the people around the world made me think that its not just me. Each and everyone of us goes through difficult, harsh, stressful times. That gave me hope that I might be ok one day, eventually. \n\nI used to think these reddit awards and upvote count is really silly and absurd, but I remember sitting alone in the hospital cafe, when somebody here sent a hug-award on my post.I chocked on coffee with tears in my eyes. I got so emotional that the nurses there took me to the ER to check my vitals.\n\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to thank you all for helping me go through this awful time.\nLove you all.",

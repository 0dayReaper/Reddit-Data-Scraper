Can anyone recommend some that will include their views and consider both side without being too biased. Also, it'll be a bonus if it's not explained in the context of America (since I'm studying in the UK) but instead something more general.",

Really diverse topic range as well. A deep dive weekly pod that's fairly deep and very good archive if you look at some of the episodes that tackle topics not tied to the day of the week.\n\nMaybe pair it with the News Agents (mentioned below by others) as that's a (weekday) daily pod that's generally light. NA will give you British focused news with a wider scope occasionally but they are somewhat decent at pressing both sides. You probably know the big host, Emily Maitliss from the Prince Andrew interview",

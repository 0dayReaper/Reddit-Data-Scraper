    "postText": "Enter \u201cMy Dad Wrote a Porno\u201d on the Stitcher app! The podcast is made up of James, Jamie, Alice\u20143 British friends who get together and read a chapter out of the amateur smut novel written by James\u2019 dad, (under the pen name \u2018Rocky Flintstone\u2019), called \u201cBelinda Blinks.\u201d His hilarious, cringey, and at times graphic NSFW depiction follows Belinda\u2014an executive in the pots and pans industry, and how she literally sleeps her way to success. The 3 friends tear it apart and will have you rolling! It\u2019s my guilty pleasure when I want something mindless, or a good laugh! You can actually buy the book on Amazon, and it\u2019s been around for awhile, so he has since written sequels to the original, but I\u2019m only on Season 2 out of 6! It is SO funny!! They also have celebrity interviews on some of the footnote episodes in between that have listened and fan mail they read as well! Hope you enjoy it!",

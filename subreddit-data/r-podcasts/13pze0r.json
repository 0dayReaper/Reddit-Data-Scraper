    "postText": "I came across this podcast called Fire Ecology Chats that is made by the Association for Fire Ecology and what they do is have people on who have recently had research published in the Fire Ecology journal to discuss the topic of the paper.\n\nLike they discuss why they were interested in doing the research, and what they found (like the discussion part of the paper) and all that. It\u2019s not super technical, and just really interesting to hear the researchers discuss something they are super knowledgeable about.\n\nThey also provide links to the papers so you can read them.\n\nSo basically, wondering if there is anything else like that out there while also letting anyone who may be interested know about that podcast.",

            "comment": "I listen to a lot of academic podcasts! My favorite, and one you might be particularly interested in, is \"In Defense of Plants.\" If you're not already listening to \"Ologies,\" the host has a different expert on every week (usually some kind of scientist) and discusses their research and the field. There are citations throughout. \"Big Biology\" and \"Science Friday\" are good too.\n\nSometimes I also just search up a major university or journal on Spotify and look through their podcasts if I'm jonesing for some new content. It's usually pretty fruitful!",

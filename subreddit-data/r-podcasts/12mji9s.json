    "postText": "Hi, I listen to A LOT of podcasts. Mostly true crime but also story telling, and a bit of self help. Problem is, it seems like I\u2019m running out. I am a welder and I work anywhere from 8-12 hours. All filled with mostly podcasts, some music, here and there. I need recommendations. Something that will intrigue me. Something that\u2019ll have me on the edge of my seat, wanting to listen to more. \nI\u2019ve listened to :\nDateline + all the mini series \n48 hours\n20/20\nMorbid\nSomething was wrong \nSnapped\nNightmare next door\nScorned \nSnapped \nThis is actually happening \nWas I in a cult?\nAnd some other series that I can\u2019t quite remember. \nAnyways,\nThanks in advance!",

The older episodes have a lot about how not to get scammed, but they do interviews with real people telling how they got scammed. The older episodes are about 30 min and I think the newer ones are closer to an hour with multi parts. I've listened to a couple of the newer ones and they're good too.

Topics like the Satanic Panic, OJ Simpson, DC Snipers. \n\nBlack Hands - who committed the family massacre in New Zealand?? \n\nHunting Warhead - horrific subject matter, excellent investigative journalism and presentation. Check trigger warnings. \n\nSwindled - infamous cons, amusing deadpan reporting. \n\nCriminal - wholesome-sounding podcaster reports on various famous crimes and crime-related subjects. Tons of episodes. \n\nMurdaugh Murders Podcast (Mandy Matney) - this one just went to verdict IRL, but if you didn\u2019t follow it closely and watch the recent docs on Netflix/HBO (or if you did and are still interested in more content), this one is a doozy. The podcaster investigated this twisted family backstory for YEARS and it\u2019s absolutely bonkers. 10/10 immersive and loads of content.\n\nDan Carlin\u2019s Hardcore History - not exactly true crime but 4-5 hour episodes (many of which a mere portion of a multi-part topic) covering gruesome and crazy battles throughout history. I\u2019m not into history or war stuff at all but this guy is so enthusiastic and does so much research, it\u2019s really fascinating.",

We know what you're thinking... \r  \n\r  \nSHUT UP, AND GIVE ME MURDER!   \n\n\nhttps://shutupandgivememurder.com/",

Could be about a carder, a hacker,  a silk road merchant, you name it. Highly interesting, almost has an interview format at times, he brings different folks on the show to tell their tales, he then edits it into a cohesive story. Highly recommend checking it out.",

Last one I swear! \n\nKiller psyche with Candice DeLong, she covers serial killers and tries to professionally break down their mindset and different conditions. Her narration is fantastic, and you will learn a lot about different conditions and how they affect the mind. Again, I highly recommend checking this one out too. Between these three shows alone, there is a tonne of content. Hope you enjoy it!",

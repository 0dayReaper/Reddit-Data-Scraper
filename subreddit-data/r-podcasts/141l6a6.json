    "postText": "Ive been desperately trying to find podcasts almost exactly like Otherworld. \n\nParanormal/unexplained stories told by the people who have experienced them (interview) etc. and conversations around them. \nI dont like ones that are over exaggerated or far fetched. Otherworld is fairly new and Ive already listened to every episode, what I like most about this podcast is its mostly uninterrupted interviews/retelling of the stories and then the host Jack Wagner is a bit of a sceptic so the stories he shares are rly unexplainable and he even gets experts on to debunk other theories etc. \n\nThank you so much in advance",

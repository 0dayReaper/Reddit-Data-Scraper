    "postText": "I'm on episode 9 of season 1. I've liked it until the introduction of Jerry. Please, if you've finished Tower 4, tell me how much more of Jerry I have to listen to. He sucks. Is he just mentally unwell? Mentally disabled? An alcoholic? The way he talks grates my nerves. It was difficult to get through these 2 episodes. If there are a lot more like this of primarily him talking, I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.",

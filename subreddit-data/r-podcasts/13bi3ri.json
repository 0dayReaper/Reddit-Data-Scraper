    "postText": "I know this sounds like a strange question but recently I've been quite hooked onto this relatively unknown Vietnamese podcast called Have a Sip by this group called Vietcetera (relatively unknown in the Western world because their content is primarily in Vietnamese, but in Vietnam they are getting more and more recognised).\n\nHere is an example of their podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL4c\\_4zco\\_4&amp;ab\\_channel=Vietcetera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL4c_4zco_4&amp;ab_channel=Vietcetera) (unfortunately it's in Vietnamese and the English translation takes a way most of the magic).\n\nThe format of the podcast is like this: each episode is a casual chat between the host and one of her guests. The setting is usually a small cafe, or the guest's own living room or art studio. There is no audience, just mainly 2 friends hanging out together (and of course a small crew).\n\nEach chat lasts about 1 and a half hour to allow the conversation to go deep enough.\n\nWhat is interesting is the caliber of the guests; they manage to invite people who are usually heavy-weights in their respective field, for example a famous professor, an accomplished artist, a zen master, or a writer who have written some best seller books. These are people who are currently thought leaders or societal leaders in Vietnam. From the host's own words, she mainly invites guests who have \"lots of words\", a Vietnamese way of describing someone who is an intellect.\n\nBut what I find to be truly special about this podcast is the host's ability -- through her skills of asking insightful questions and connecting with her guests (I think the casual, relaxing setting and the length of each interview help) -- to let the guests connect with something deeper within themselves and be comfortable to share very deep, meaningful and personal topic. The conversation is usually not about knowledge or world events, but about their thoughts process, their creative process, how did they get their inspirations from, what motivates them in life, what important decisions they have made in life that shaped their life, their life philosophy, etc. There is a lot of wisdoms to be found in each episode.\n\nSorry for the lengthy description but I don't know how to better summarise it.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking for podcasts similar to Have A Sip, in either English or Chinese. The closest I can think of in English is Oprah Winfrey, except that:\n\n\\- I wish that the setting of Oprah's show is more casual and there is no audience. It's easier for people to speak their mind and reach deep into themselves when there is no audience watching them.\n\n\\- Oprah tends to talk too much for my linking. I would prefer the guest to speak most of the time and the host is mainly there to facilitate them.\n\nBased on my description, do you know of any podcasts similar to this in either English or Chinese?\n\nThank you for any pointers. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude04\n\n\\---\n\nNote: To be clear and not to waste your time, this is NOT what I'm looking for:\n\n* I'm not looking for podcasts where the host is the main speakers, and there is no guest\n* I'm not looking for podcasts that are interviewing primarily celebrities for entertainment value\n* I'm not looking for podcasts that is primarily about knowledge, news, world events\n* I'm not looking for podcasts who the hosts mainly invites random people or their friends as guests\n* I'm not looking for podcasts that aim at language learners",

    "postText": "Hi!! I might be getting a little too specific, but looking for a more casual self-help podcast. I enjoy podcasts that are more funny and entertaining and have been trying to listen to some self-help ones. They\u2019re mostly all more kind of like a lecture, which I don\u2019t mind listening to once and a while. But id prefer something that I can listen to and laugh while also learning more about myself and how to live a better life. \n\n\nThank you :)",

            "comment": "Happier with Gretchen Rubin is my favorite in that department! She does the podcast with her sister and they personally experiment with what they talk about. Lots of their theories make me think about my own life and habits and never in a negative way which has surprised me! They are very non judgemental and practical. \n\nThe Lazy Genius Podcast is also really good, but I found it resonates less with me and my personal life! It's more about housekeeping, organization, how to stress less, etc. Whereas Happier is more about everyday habits and like 'hacks' and tricks based on science around happiness.",

It's definitely conversational in style, and often funny but also sometimes serious. In the re-brand of the show, they look into an aspect of wellness/self-improvement and discuss it, along with answering listener advice questions.\n\nThere are a lot of episodes in the back-catalogue. They take all the books seriously, and try to find what works as well as what doesn't.",

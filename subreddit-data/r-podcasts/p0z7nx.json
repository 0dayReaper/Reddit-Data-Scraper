I listened to mostly history and \u2018stuff you should know\u2019 podcasts but JRE (and ACs \u2018pirate ship\u2019) was one of the few that had good audio quality and could be funny. So I listened. Absolutely dropped it cold when in 2013 after I heard Joe say \u201cwomen get vaginal yeast infections because they are promiscuous\u201d and he stated like a fact, as if he was a doctor of gynecology. This piece of misogynistic bullshit made me realize quick they this man was a danger promoting nonsense and non-medical opinions like he had some authority to do so. And come to find out in 2020 he was still doing it! But now about vaccines for deadly global pandemic. Glad I stopped listening in 2013. But sadly people I know still take Joe very seriously and do everything he and his guests think is a good idea. It\u2019s sad really. Edit: There are so many better funny and science-y and even health related podcasts out there now. No reason to continue listening to that guy.",

But he has a brand that, AFAIK is still stoner, and he moved permanent locations to a place where possession is at minimum a fine and potential jail time (180 days for under 2oz I believe) , with incredibly low thc percentage regulation on medical. How, without changing brand, is this not held up as the most bullshit of bullshit double standards? He moved because of taxes, but disregards their other stringent laws blatantly. \n\nI'm not under the impression that life is actually fair, however the law is not supposed to be so absurdly one-sided, and anytime this disparity comes up, it should be shouted about until the nonsense prohibition is over.

You probably don't know half a percentage of all the people in Texas.

It's not faultless but that's part of the appeal. This is also the show where I can hear viewpoints of a wider spectrum in a way that is palatable although I may disagree. Which helps keeping my mind out of the proverbial echo-chamber.\n\nI can't think of another podcast that has the same quality of guests in long format and variety of topics, viewpoints and levels of rationality (from insane to brilliant). Other shows are much more focused, specialised, mainstream, low quality or stuck in a corner and don't cover this spectrum.\n\nThrough this show I discovered plenty people that I probably wouldn't have heard of otherwise, E.g Andy Norman, Mariana Van Zeller, Jonathan Zimmerman, Edward Slingerhand, Sebastian Junger, Shanna Swan, Adam Curry,...\n\nHe is maybe not a great interviewer, more a conversationalist. Again, the man is flawed, as are we all. But he does bring a unique perspective (he has a unique background, mix of skills and I respect his track in life)\n\nCan you name me another show that has an equal spectrum of guests, rationality, topics and viewpoints?",

We don't know each other and probably will never knowingly meet. Let's keep on topic, shall we?\n\nTo your point, even if off topic. On the contrary, I think someone must be a peculiar person to come to the conclusion that anyone has nothing epic. My dead greatgrandmother who I never met let alone know her name, probably had epic aspects. Finding interesting perspectives in any person is imho a useful skill. Although I know not the least of you, I am confident if we'd have a f2f conversation we'd quickly come to some fascinating perspectives.\n\nAs to the etymology of epic; it stems from the Greek word for song and translates into \"grand, heroic\". I definitely can see aspects of an epic journey in Elons story. If humanity still exists in 100 or 1000 years from now, his name has a good chance of still being mentioned in history. So yes, that is kind of epic (regardless of my utterly irrelevant opinion of Elon Musk).",

They just don't. Most academics and researchers are just broke kids who desperately passionately want to contribute to science, they have no \"ulterior motive\". They're more than happy to explain their work to those who would listen.\n\nBut when they do explain, and that explanation doesn't fit the model that dumb people already have, the dumb people instead think \"Oh no, it's the so-called smart people who are wrong, they're just **gatekeeping** and trying to justify their paycheck.\"\n\nBelieve me, Joe Rogan's audience does not think he is smart, not at all. In fact it's the defense they run to when he knowingly says irresponsible things, \"He says he's an idiot himself\", as if that absolves him of responsibility. Instead they think that \"smart people\" (meaning researchers and academics and institutions) are not actually smart, thus leveling the playing field. It galvanizes people and makes them feel like their completely uninformed ideas are on par with ideas proposed by people who have spent their entire life studying something.",

Last 5 years it was mostly him rehashing the same tired shit and I became a once in a while listener when he had an interesting guest. Last 2 years he has become a self important out of touch windbag, unfortunately this coincided with his influence peaking. Now I am a non listener and the only connection I have is his Instagram account, which now that I think about it is just creepy boomer selfies I\u2019m gonna go unfollow that shit right now.",

When he was in LA, Joe Rogan had on actors, comedians, scientists, friends, cooks and nutjobs, etc.  You could skip the episodes with bad guests and idiots, but there was enough really good content to make for a great show.  There were a lot of must watch episodes like Elon Musk, Kanye West, Duncan Trussell, Bernie Sanders, and the sober October episodes.  And any interesting or exciting bit of the show was made as a clip on YouTube so you could discover interesting moments of lesser known people like that sleep scientist (and skip the nutjobs).\n\nThere are three problems with recent JRE\n\n1. He can't get the same high profile guests like he did back in LA.  That's just the nature of moving to Austin.  And because he's in Texas, the guests tended to skew towards right wing people and conservative comedians.\n2. There's only a few clips per episode after the Spotify move, so you're not constantly running into interesting moments from lesser known people anymore.  Plus the show is much less convenient to watch.\n3. Covid happened, and mine and a lot of people's tolerance for denying the problem or getting in the way of solving it is zero.\n\nHere's what Joe Rogan and Spotify can do:\n\n1. Have 10 clips per episode of interesting topics in the conversation, not just 3\n2. Make the Spotify interface better, since it's so annoying to jump into episodes\n3. Cut down on the covid talk, please.  And give a bigger voice to legitimate scientists like Michael Osterholm if you must.\n4. Get some better guests.  Even if it's on Zoom.  Or even build a second studio in LA or New York.  Joe Rogan certainly has the money.",

As soon as he started spewing his bullshit about Covid I pretty much cut him out of my podcast listening and have un-subbed him on various platforms. I will admit that I do occasionally catch the odd episode, but it's gone from casual listening to one in a blue moon. I will say that the recent episode with Yeonmi Park was eye-opening while simultaneously being horrifying and heart-wrenching. \n\nFrom here on out I will keep my JRE exposure to an absolute minimum because frankly, there are much better podcasts out there with hosts who are way more proficient at hosting interviews and getting the most out of their guests.",

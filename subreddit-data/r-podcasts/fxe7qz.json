There's a state law that they're basing the suit from that carries over aspects of privacy for something like 20 years after a person's death? And since the creator didn't get a release to use the information he was given in the way that he did, the lawsuit is alleging that he is violating that statute.\n\nThat's the gist of it from what I read. If you want more specific info, just google s-town lawsuit and you can find articles on it.",

It has been interesting so far. Happy face grabbed me immediately BTW. Dirty John is a fan favorite but I don\u2019t think it needs to be recommended, pretty much everyone has heard of that one. Same with Dr. Death I presume, but if you haven\u2019t I would highly recommend that one as well. It was mesmerizing, especially as I am someone who has been a long term patient with many operations and long term hospital stays and someone who works in the medical field. A Very Fatal Murder is a good one of you want a silly fake one pretending to be real done by the Onion. You know how S-Town felt made up? A Very Fatal Murder is made up but hit all of the right spots like that. Over My Dead Body was pretty good, not the best but was worth a listen. I also just started The Dating Game Killer. I am only two episodes in so can\u2019t speak for it as a whole, but it is decent so far. \nThe Monster series is good, but very analytical, I feel they went the wrong direction in certain ones, like they got sidetracked, or they drew it out for too long on others. Out of the three, I feel they did their best work on DC Sniper. Atlanta Monster didn\u2019t present enough info, and Zodiac was too drawn out and felt like they were rehashing most of the Fincher movie and trying to present the guy most people suspect as a victim.\nOn different genres and subjects I can also recommend Mysterious Universe for good paranormal and ancient aliens type material, and Worm as an excellent story well worth the mediocre mic work if you like super hero and supervillain stuff.",

Some of this stuff really can scare you and make you think about things differently.  \n\nThis guy was just so fucking nefarious.  Complete asshole, thrived not so much on killing as he did on terrorizing people over and over again.  There were women who heard from him multiple times over the course of several years.  He would taunt victims whom he had previously raped.  He would purposefully break into houses when the entire family was home, so they could all hear him while he raped the women.\n\nHe started as a peeping Tom and progressed, operating for decades. just caught in the last year or two thanks to familial dna technology like 23&amp;me.\n\nSide note obligatory Albert Fish mention.  Anyone who is into true crime but hasn\u2019t heard the details of this guy, he is what I use to try out new crime podcasts.  I don\u2019t search for true crime.  I search for Albert fish.

I loved how S Town was unfolding as it was being recorded, and how even our narrator didn\u2019t know what was coming as it was being created. \nI loved Bear Brook because it had a wonderful resolution that had a wide reaching effect in the real world, and law enforcement and put a name to a serial killer that even the prisons and the courtrooms didn\u2019t have. The investigation found out who he was 2 years after his death because he never told them who he really was, and it ties him to multiple other murders under all other assumed names he had. S-Towns strength was also its weakness,  felt it had poor resolution because no one knew where it would end up, and it didn\u2019t end up leading to something satisfying, it just ended in Shit Town with shitty people and a dead man who no one really knew as well as they thought and a lot of lose ends.",

If you\u2019ve ever been to obed, the camping spot at the time was pretty primitive, right down a dirt road past a shack of a brewery (it\u2019s awesome and I heard they\u2019re expanding for bigger and better facilities! Climbers check it out.) - but in the middle of the night, after driving for hours, when S Town was getting sufficiently crazy and chaotic, that was not where we were. My girlfriend had put the slightly wrong address into the GPS, so we were in the middle of nowhere with no cell service and no idea where we were or how much farther we had to go. We were both creeped out being in the back woods of TN after just listening to the craziness on S Town. \n\nTLDR: S Town is a fantastic podcast, and seeing it here reminded me of a fond memory of a fun road trip with my fianc\u00e9e. Definitely worth a listen if you like crazy dramas about eccentric individuals.",

    "postText": "Want to start listening to podcasts and I wanted to have a way to go back to certain spots of podcasts for info I want to look up later or parts I want to listen to again. I was looking at Pocket Casts, Overcast, and Castro, but they just give the ability to share a clip.\n\nI was wondering if there was an app that has a feature to bookmark a certain part of the podcast or create a clip that stays in the app so that it's easier to listen to later, or will I have to do the share clip thing and have it share to like an Evernote or Notion notebook or something?",

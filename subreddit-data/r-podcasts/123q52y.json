    "postText": "This was a podcast about ancient history\nIt\u2019s by a man \nListened to it about a year ago but not sure when it was first released \nIt was focused on ancient history, particular Persian, Greek, Roman etc. \nit was very interesting because he would tell us the information that we have -the recorded histories, the stories, etc. then he would analyze that and read in between the lines to wonder what actually happened. \nHe kept saying something like \u201cyou have to believe in ancient history\u201d because it all we have - essentially like yea we know Caesar lied in his reports of his travels etc. to make himself look better, but it\u2019s the only account we have of what happened so we have to believe that it\u2019s the truth \nHe also went into depth wondering what battles were actually like..\nIt was so up my alley!! I just can\u2019t remember the guys name but I know it\u2019s pretty well known",

    "postText": "Just wanted to talk about this horror anthology podcast as I don\u2019t know how well known it is. Each episode is a scary story, and honestly they\u2019re creepy as hell to me, creepier than Knifepoint Horror which I also like. The host\u2019s voice excellently elevated the mood. Seems to have come back from hiatus and can\u2019t wait to hear the new episode! Some of my favorite stories I recommend are \u201cOrb\u201d, \u201cShrine\u201d, and \u201cMemory Box\u201d.",

The format is a little weird, and at least for the first dozen episodes I've listened to the narrator has a weird vocal affect where he's speaking unnaturally deep, and the \"archive\" part of the story gets a little silly sometimes... But the stories are interesting, creative, and varied",

That\u2019s a great one too though. if you liked Magnus you\u2019ll probably like WNMTK because it\u2019s mysterious as well, with not much explained.",

Stories, RPGs, instructionals, something ghibli-esque, just, feel good podcasts that inject a little magic into the day to day.\n\nI have listened to primarily the mcelroy's (the adventure zone, my brother my brother and me, schmanners, wonderful, positiviteeny, etc), but I want to branch out more.",

            "comment": "I listen to waaaay too many podcasts (TAZ, MBMBAM, and Wonderful among them). Here are some whimsical ones I think you might like (with short descriptions)\n\n**A Problem Squared** \\- Two Aussie comedians answer problems sent in by listeners (sometimes with a lot of math). Very funny &amp; out there\n\n**The Curious Cases of Rutherford &amp; Fry** \\- Two British Drs (a geneticist &amp; a mathematician) answer questions sent in by listeners. The hosts play off one another very well\n\n**Dear Hank &amp; John** \\- Two American brothers (and authors) answer questions sent in by listeners (I'm sensing a theme to my suggestions). Maybe you've heard of John and Hank Green via their books, YouTube videos, or charity events?\n\n**Delete This!** \\- Hank Green (from above) and his wife used to review Hank's twitter feed for the week but recently they've transitioned into a weird Wet vs Dry tournament. #CoupleGoals\n\n**Doug Loves Movies** \\- Stoner comedian Doug Benson has 2-4 comedian/actor/celeb friends on to play movie-based trivia games. Huge backlog (and I was on two old episodes!)\n\n**Endless Thread** \\- Started out exploring stories from Reddit but it's expanded to cover tons of weird histories &amp; mysteries from online/real life.\n\n**Escape This Podcast** \\- Australian Husband &amp; Wife host friends and celebrities (Neil Patrick Harris has been on several) for audio escape rooms. Great audio (and visual via links) puzzles with most of the rooms available for free download if you want to play with friends!\n\nThis couple has a spin-off podcast, **Solve This Murder**, where they write murder mysteries (or sometimes use public domain Agatha Christie novels) where one has to collect clues, interview suspects/witnesses, and try to solve whodunits!\n\n**Finish It!** \\- Two brothers are on a mission to read every page &amp; every ending of every Choose Your Own Adventure (or similar branching-style) book. The boys have some serious skills when it comes to jingles (every segment has its own theme song) \n\n**Go Fact Yourself** \\- Game show with two celebs who bring 3 topics they're \"experts\" in. One is selected with increasing-difficulty questions, ending with a 3-part question answered by an expert (sometimes more celebrities). Sort of like a British panel show with fun questions and stories\n\n**How Could You?!** \\- A Pennsylvania husband and wife who met &amp; fell in love at a movie theatre and never left. They started talking about movies one of them has never seen (how COULD they?!) but they've progressed to talk about all sorts of great movies.\n\n**Lateral with Tom Scott** \\- British YouTuber hosts three friends and they all ask each other strange lateral-thinking puzzles. Lots of fun discussion\n\n**No Such Thing As a Fish** \\- Four writers behind the UK show QI talk about strange facts every week (and then spiral out to other related weird stories). Literally a behind-the-scenes of those great British panel shows\n\n**Screw It, We're Just Gonna Talk About Comics** \\- Two comedian brothers read and talk about comics they grew up reading (or sometimes comics they missed). \n\n**Triviality - A Trivia Game Show Podcast** \\- Four Chicago boys post weekly pub-style like quizzes (sometimes hosted by listeners/friends). \"A lack of seriousness meets a little bit of knowledge\" is their slogan\u2014a lot of weird jokes throughout the questions and answers",

Escape this Podcast is a show where a couple runs through audio escape rooms. They sometimes have guests, too, that solve rooms or run them for the hosts. It's a very cool and chill show. Finish It is a podcast where two brothers read through the Choose Your Own Adventure books and other Interactive Fiction pieces. I personally recommend looking into both of those. God bless and I hope you find something you like!",

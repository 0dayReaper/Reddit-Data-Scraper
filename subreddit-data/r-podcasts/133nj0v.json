    "postText": "Back into full podcast consumption with baby number two - looking to share my good finds from the last baby's first sleepless year and find a few new ones to get me through this one's 2 hourly feeds. \n\n\nLooking for quite light entertainment, nothing too serious or grim as I tend anxious while sleep deprived. Interests are fairly broad - history, cooking, bad movies, video and board games, real life legal stuff. I also love listening to someone knowledgeable, passionate and funny explaining their deep knowledge on a topic, kinda doesn't matter what the topic is.\n\n\nMy old favourites, some very mainstream stuff - the dollop, my Dad wrote a Porno, No such thing as a fish, How did this get made, The Dream. \n\n\nSome recommendations folks may not have heard of - just the gist (aussie comedian does aussie bachelor recaps then moves to a dollop like format) - The worst idea of all time (2 new Zealand comedians watch grownups 2 once a week for a year and slowly go mad) - Crypto critics corner (excellent crypto sceptical podcast very committed to getting their facts right).\n\n\nEdit - thank you all for your suggestions, I've found several really perfect podcasts, some with a decade of content, so I have company for my late nights for some time now!",

            "comment": "The Connect (with Shea Serrano and Jason Concepcion) - they pick a theme that is usually pretty absurd and then they each pick a movie related to that theme and both watch it and discuss. They have a great rapport and the show is genuinely funny. \n\nShip Hits the Fan - covers maritime disasters which does not sound funny but often ends up being funny, S3Ep3 The Pride of the Swedish Navy Sinks Immediately is a good starting point - if you like that one, go back to the beginning and you'll like the rest. If you don't, it's probably not the right pod for you.\n\nThese Books Made Me - library ladies discuss books from childhood with girl protagonists, light and fun vibes - start with the Babysitter's Club Kristy episode to see if it is something you'll like\n\nBinge Mode - they've covered a lot of movies, books and tv shows; great rapport between the 2 hosts\n\nOut on the Lanai - covers the Golden Girls episode by episode; this assumes you like the Golden Girls, but really who doesn't like the Golden Girls?\n\nNewcomers - 2 comedians (Nicole Byer, who you'll know from HDTGM Bloodsport and The Meg and Lauren Lapkus) dive into Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and Marvel for the first time",

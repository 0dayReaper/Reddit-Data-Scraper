She is amazing. \n\nIf you are just looking for general podcasts where people talk about their issues with addiction and their journeys that help them work through guilt &amp; shame or are hosted by people who help normalize what living with that process is like, Dax Shephard on Armchair Expert is really good with that. There are specific episodes with celebrities who\u2019ve been through it that can feel cathartic to listen to, as well as some of the episodes from their off-shoot podcast Experts on Experts. His episode \u201cDay 7\u201d where he talks about his recent relapse is one that might speak to you. (If you search for suggestions of specific episodes about addiction or shame, I think there are some Reddit posts that have suggestions).  \n\nA friend recommended this podcast about self love/self hatred - it\u2019s not addiction specific &amp; I haven\u2019t listened to it yet, but figured I\u2019d share it in case it helps \ud83d\ude0a [ADVICE FROM A LOVING BITCH](https://rythea.com/advice)",

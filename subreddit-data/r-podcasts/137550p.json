It\u2019s pretty fun, but I don\u2019t really follow sports so I can\u2019t get interested in it enough. Also there are limited episodes. I\u2019ve found that movie review podcasts are what work for me. It\u2019s tricky finding one where the people are fun to listen to but don\u2019t get so excited that it keeps me awake. I like  \u201cNow Playing - the movie review podcast\u201d the best, but there are others. \u201cThe Rewatchables\u201d has different guests per episode so it\u2019s not always good for me, but thats another to check out.",

It\u2019s interesting but I don\u2019t tend to worry about missing out on something. It also tends to be fairly lighthearted and humorous and disconnected from current events. Also they publish a new show every week and are on episode 460 something so you have plenty of back catalogue and since each episode is broken up into four distinct parts if you catch part of an episode before falling asleep it\u2019s easy enough to pick up around where you left off and just continue on the next night without really missing anything.",

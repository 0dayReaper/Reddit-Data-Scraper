    "postText": "My father passed away this morning after battling Covid-19 for over month. This is the first time that I\u2019ve ever had anyone close to me pass away and I\u2019ve been trying to find things to listen to that\u2019ll keep me distracted but also reflective. I am thankfully seeing a therapist, but I was hoping to find a podcast or some podcast episodes to help me navigate this difficult time. Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for such kind and amazing words and for so many recommendations! I\u2019m honestly tearing up as I write this but I just appreciate it all very much. I\u2019ve been trying to go through every comment, albeit a little slowly, I\u2019m a little overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t think that this would get much attention but it\u2019s been wonderful reading all of your comments and well wishes. &lt;3 I just want to say too that I am in therapy already and I know that a podcast isn\u2019t something that\u2019ll replace the benefits of that, but it\u2019ll be nice for the moments that just feel a little too quiet ya know? It\u2019s the small things.",

I rolled my eyes at it, because I would never. But as the ride progressed, this thing started cutting straight through me. By the end of my ride, I was welling up. I took note of the name, and searched for it on podcasts. The sermon is called \"What To Do In A Valley\", by Jabin Chavez. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I couldn't care less about converting you, because I am still a non-theist. But I have listened to it several times over, and it really does something for me. The guy is also pretty funny, which helps.\n\nHere's the link: [https://podcasts.apple.com/gh/podcast/what-to-do-in-a-valley-jabin-chavez/id216015753?i=1000454303330](https://podcasts.apple.com/gh/podcast/what-to-do-in-a-valley-jabin-chavez/id216015753?i=1000454303330)\n\nIt's also available on youtube: [https://youtu.be/cBNGPsjvDmo](https://youtu.be/cBNGPsjvDmo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest wishes.",

The Reality Slap is a great book by Russ Harris that is wonderful. There are also some memoir style books I can recommend that are also great.

I know you specifically asked for podcasts to help you navigate this time, and by the looks of the comments here it seems like you have some good resources. I am going to recommend the podcast Heavyweight by Jonathon Goldstein. I can't say it will specifically address your grief, but it has a melancholly tone but each episode has an uplifting and simple resolution. \n\nI am sure you will want to zone out and just relax at times as you work through the coming weeks and this might be a good bridge from the heavy work that is therapy to the IMO \"bright and cheery\" world of radio from ira glass and guy raz.",

I\u2019ve been reading a book that could help you beyond what distractions could. It doesn\u2019t disrupt any religious beliefs but it IS spiritual and teaches you to break toxic mind functions and patterns that people normally live with their whole life. It helped me with my mind and spirit as far as addiction and I personally believe certain philosophies of this book could save humans as a species. Sounds corny but it\u2019s called The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. If you apply what\u2019s in that book, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind it will help. I wish you and your family strength man.",

It\u2019s not quite what you\u2019re looking for either but the Stock Market Crash of \u201829 series was also so interesting to me. \n\nSome of his other episodes *might* be closer, like the Spartans. But sounds like maybe you\u2019re looking more for a focus on military strategy? I\u2019m more into social/cultural forces and history wrapped around a personality I order to get that stuff into my brain. Otherwise I zone out.",

There are a lot of episodes as it began in 2017.\n\nCovert is not necessarily generals and their decisions but still an interesting podcast about various special operations. This show also has people that were either involved with the op or have experience with the group to explain.",

            "comment": "You should check out Hardcore History with Dan Carlin. It's a classic. \n\nFor something that will give you a timeline-like effect, I suggest listening, in the following order, to:\n\nBlueprints for Armageddon (a series about WWI)\n\nGhosts of the Ostfront (a series about WWII eastern theater)\n\nSupernova in the East (a series about the WWII pacific theater)\n\nThe Destroyer of Worlds (a big episode about the development and use of nuclear weapons)\n\nYears ago, I listened to all of these episodes more or less back-to-back over a couple weeks at work, and it left me with a profound sense of the movement of time. Learning about how rapidly modern weapons systems have been developed into the ultimate form of destruction, and how such insane levels of mechanized violence have shaped the political reality of the world today, made me feel like the modern world was strapped to the tip of a metaphorical missile, screaming through time in an uncontrolled and reckless way, with imminent disaster looming ahead of us. Definitely a mind-bending experience.",

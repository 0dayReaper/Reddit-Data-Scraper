If you like pop/rock music and it's history, you'll like this. He goes in-depth into songs and the bands and the process of how they got to us. Really entertaining and informative on my long dog walks. https://500songs.com/",

            "comment": "This podcast is absolutely tremendous. I am a music historian at the Library of Congress and this is currently my favorite music podcast. His research is excellent, the scope of the project allows for detailed understanding of the songs, composers, and performers. His dry humor may not be for everyone but I firmly believe if he finishes this project with the same enthusiasm and intensity as the current 164 episodes, it is going to rank among the most important surveys of 20th century music. I HIGHLY recommend listening to the playlists he builds from the music featured in each episode, they are brilliant. And Andrew, if you're reading this, know that I have forced everyone I know in the recorded sound depart to listen to the show!",

There is an entire missing decade in the public memory of the genre. Mostly music released on 78 that documents the genre's origins from big band, jump, western swing, and rockabilly. The highest praise I can give this show is that it has genuinely changed and deepened my understanding and love of the music and in particular the music industry running the show at the time.",

I know nothing compared to this person's research. I have learned so much more through Andrew's podcast.\n\n It is so listenable and interesting, with stories regarding not just pioneers but ancestors to rock and roll. I can't think of another show or article that so deeply linked the beginnings of The Velvet Underground to doo wop AND the beginnings of a very niche classical movement. \n\nAndrew is also sensitive to modern listeners sensibilities and potential triggering incidents. I appreciate what he selects to reveal and not reveal about certain musicians behaviours. His episode on the Mamas and Papas is the best example.",

I don't have a good enough ear for music to really appreciate the developing sounds of rock and roll, but the stories are very interesting, and the early days of recorded music were rough as hell for some people. \n\nA lot of the early performers, particularly African-Americans, would write and record a song and then almost immediately watch some white singer do a cover that made a lot more money.",

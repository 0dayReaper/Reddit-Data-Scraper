I had only four days and I still think I got a lot of unique and fun sounds.\n\n[https://freetousesounds.com/ho-chi-minh-city-sound-effects-traffic-crowds-industrial-sounds/](https://freetousesounds.com/ho-chi-minh-city-sound-effects-traffic-crowds-industrial-sounds/)\n\nYou can read a little bit more about these sound recordings that I filled with pictures. If you don't have time to read just click on \"Download\" in the header and you jump to the embedded Bandcamp Player. Click Download again, type in \"0\" and choose \"wav\" for the high-quality files. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you can use and Greetings from Vietnam\n\nMarcel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Later if you want you can get a Zoom H6 ( was my second recorder) and the you can always go with Usi Pro microphones. They around 120 Euro for a stereo pair.

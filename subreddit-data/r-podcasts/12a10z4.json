    "postText": "YouTube\u2019s related videos feature is pretty good. Got me thinking about the following problems I\u2019ve come across with my own listening:\n\n1. Only one episode of a podcast is relevant or interesting to me. To discover something like this I would need to subscribe to a podcast and skip most episodes. \n\n2. Good podcast episodes don\u2019t resurface easily. Unlike YouTube videos, they are more like Facebook posts that get drown out by new posts. If you discover a good podcast that has stopped updating a year ago. Subscribing to it is pretty pointless. \n\n3. No good \u201crelated episodes\u201d feature in most players of the current episode you\u2019re listening to.",

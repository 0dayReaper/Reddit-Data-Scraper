I'm currently using Google Podcasts to do this.\n\nThe feeds are set up and everything shows up and plays. The problem is that they always start from the beginning and I can't navigate. The 30 second skips don't work. Moving the progress bar doesn't do anything. If I refresh the page it starts over.\n\nIt does not do this for non-rss podcasts. Those work fine.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?",

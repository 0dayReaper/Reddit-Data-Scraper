I used to use headspace but that\u2019s more for sitting at home meditation since sometimes you have to close your eyes.\n\nI recently started listening to a positive thinking type podcast for my morning routine but it turned out to be a religious thing and I\u2019m not looking for that.\n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated.",

They cut out the music so it\u2019s just the chat, joking around, phone ins &amp; discussion of current events in a light hearted way.\n\nI chose one from a city on the other side of the country from me. In another life I would live there. The main host is a comedian and there are 2 other hosts. It just makes me smile and laugh everyday.\n\nYou might have to try a few to find one that has the vibe that you are looking at but the beauty of podcasts is that you can try different ones from all over the world. It\u2019s not positive thinking etc but sometimes it\u2019s just nice to listen to something that makes you happy.\n\nHope that helps",

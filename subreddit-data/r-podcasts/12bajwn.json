I was trying to find it again to recommend to a couple of my family members who are still very Catholic but open to discussion about politics and morals.\n\nThank you again for helping me and facilitating good, honest conversation",

It's \"a podcast about how the supreme court sucks\" which may not be your first go to, because I saw you're in Canada, but it's 3 lawyers breaking down supreme court cases and explaining how the decisions made are detrimental to society. IANAL, but even so, it is fascinating hearing detailed breakdowns on how important legal arguments can be dogshit.\n\nPS as a Royals fan, thank you for the first win of the year last night, but your boys in Toronto are good and I hope they do big things this year. F the Yankees",

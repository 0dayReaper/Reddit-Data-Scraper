New people reached out with bits of information. All the tiny details &amp; bits were presented as a whole by the podcast. The police had been working the case on &amp; off for years. The podcast caused certain suspects to talk on the tapped phone lines. Eventually with that, renewed public interest and new technology, the DA took the case to court. \n\nThere still isn't a body. It was a very difficult case.",

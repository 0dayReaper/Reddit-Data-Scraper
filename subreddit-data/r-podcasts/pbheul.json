    "postText": "Interesting (and unsurprising) article from The Verge: [Joe Rogan, confined to Spotify, is losing influence](https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach)\n\n&gt;A new data investigation by The Verge finds that the powerful podcaster\u2019s influence has waned since he went behind Spotify\u2019s wall. His show has declined as a hype vehicle for guests, and Rogan\u2019s presence as a mainstay in the news has plummeted.\n\nI've never listened to Rogan personally, but any podcast that stops being available in my podcast player of choice (Podcast Addict) stops being something that I listen to at all. It would seem that I'm not alone in that regard.",

I frequently have to restart my app and its a minimum of 30 sec for it to load (I own a 2yr old phone). And premium access use to mean an ad free experience. But I'm paying them a subscription and hearing a shit ton of ads. I'm not sure what I'm paying for anymore.",

I often download albums or podcasts to listen to offline, but the app needs like 4 different restarts to even know you not using the internet. Afterwards it takes a lot of time to load your downloaded stuff and to make it worse, if you go online it sometimes just forget where you were in a podcast so good luck finding your last moment in a podcast. Also you can't view video on the TV app. So yeah, shitty Spotify need to up their game.",

Hey I was cool with ads when the podcast was free but you're going to make your podcast be exclusive on a paid network and I still have to listen to ads?! Fuck that.

Now that it is paywalls off, that all goes away. Without the fresh source of cultural capital flowing in, the external drive drops. \n\nIt seems unlikely Rogan is even away of the slowdown in growth.

No.\n\nThing about podcasts is that you can listen to them wherever you want. Your platform, app of choice, whatever... Switching platforms / services where you listen because of one podcast going exclusive encourages others to do the same thing. End game is that you will have shitload of accounts, services, apps and more important subscriptions just so you can listen to stuff you listened to before in one app.\n\nIf I can't listen podcast trough Overcast, I won't listen to it at all. Plenty of great content out there not being locked out behind some exclusive bullshit thing.",

            "comment": "\"What Had Happened Was\" is an in-depth interview taking listeners through a musicians entire history as told by the musician. There are three series so far: Prince Paul, El-P, and producer Dante Ross (which I would skip that last one, it's really narcissistic self-mythologizing). \n\nThere are more sensationalistic and episodic podcasts like \"Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones\" and \"Disgraceland\" that are really fun.",

I was very into it when it came out and but at some point his cadence and artistic license presented as fact made it unlistenable for me\n\nI added a few episodes of WHHW and haven\u2019t listened yet, but Dante Ross was just on Dopey and I thought he was very NYC funny, blunt and relatively balanced with his self deprecation and narcissism.  I can see that scale tipping that way tho\n\nIn that dopey episode he called MC Serch a self serving dickhead iirc and that was pretty funny",

Can\u2019t wait for Season 3!\n\nAnd \u201cartistic license\u201d is a very polite way to describe how the Disgraceland host just makes up shit about what people were thinking right before they died. I know it\u2019s become popular, but I think the host sees himself as way cooler and funnier than he is.",

            "comment": "Long Shadow is so good! I have been binging so much about the far right in the last couple of years. As an Arab Scot who arrived in Scotland from North Africa just before 9/11 when I was a wee kid, I've noticed such big changes in attitude over the last couple of decades. Which has turned into me wanting to find out how people can get sucked in by this shit so much. \nThe following is all mainly investigative journalism podcasts because that's what I know about and really enjoy. Hope you find this list helpful. Nothing on it earlier than 2020 I think, but it's all still pretty relevant now. \n\nIf you are enjoying Long Shadow and want some similar ideas in podcasts without 300 episodes to catch up on (because I have the exact same issue on thinking I need to listen to them in chronological order, which just seems overwhelming, so I know exactly what you mean!!) then I would highly highly recommend literally anything by Leah Sotille - she is a journalist from Spokane Oregon and has written loads about the far right as she grew up in a stronghold area with Aryan Nations etc. She did the podcast '**Bundyville**' (2 seasons, 10 Eps per season I think) which was so well done. I personally really enjoyed the second season but they are both great. \nShe also did '**2 minutes past 9**' which is about the Oklahoma city bombing - I think it's 8 eps, only one season. \nLeah Sotille did '**Burn Wild**', which was about far left activists who were on FBI's most wanted list for years because of criminal activism. Really good as well. \n(I didn't realise how much I liked her stuff till this minute \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)\n\nNYT did a good podcast on how easy it is for the far right to radicalise young men online called '**Rabbit Hole**'. One season, maybe 8 or 10 eps. It's from 2020 but it's still relevant and super interesting imho. \n\nCBC's '**White Hot Hate**' is also about the far right radicalisation in Canada as well as America. \n\nBBC has '**The Coming Storm**' which is about the January 6th insurrection. 1 season, 11 episodes. \n\nHope you any of the recommendations!!",

They could have made at least another season. \n\nMild spoilers ahead!\nLance was approached to go to space for a reality tv show, years ago during nsync times. So they send him to Kasachstan for training. He talks about his time there, very interesting and funny. He also talk about the first man in space, Yuri gagarin, What happened to the Last Soviet in space when the union fell. \n\nReally very interesting, at times a bit confusing timeline wise, they skip from lances experience to Yuri to why Russians like cucumbers so much. Lance is an amazing host tho!!! Hope he'll do more.\n\n\nIm subscribed to a lot of podcasts from Wondery and see their adds, that's how I find new ones. \n\nIdk if you like celebrity gossip/deep dives but I can recommend \nShameless and Even The Rich. Mostly two to three episodes dives. Very kind not snotty or mean. \n\nDecor Ring is another podcast I've just found. Has 75 episodes, not all are interesting to me but the Columbo one was so damn amazing!!! \n\n[https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vZGVjb2RlcnJpbmc/episode/MTAwMDYwODQ5OTE1MA?ep=14](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vZGVjb2RlcnJpbmc/episode/MTAwMDYwODQ5OTE1MA?ep=14)\n\n\"Decoder Ring is the show about cracking cultural mysteries. In each episode, host Willa Paskin takes a cultural question, object, or habit; examines its history; and tries to figure out what it means and why it matters.\"\n\nEdit : talk to me about a hostage negotiator. With the very best new jerseys (?) accent. Love it! Just started this year I believe. 27 episodes. \n[https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9kY2FzdG9uZS5jb20vcG9kY2FzdD9jYXRlZ29yeUlEMj0yMzE5?ep=14](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9kY2FzdG9uZS5jb20vcG9kY2FzdD9jYXRlZ29yeUlEMj0yMzE5?ep=14)",

Andi is the \"drama kid\" because she comes from a theater background and Jim is the \"sports kid\" because he grew up playing sports and is still a big fan. Jim tells Andi stories from professional sports that are particularly exciting or dramatic.\n\nIt's super funny and you don't have to be into or know anything about sports or drama to enjoy it. Highly recommend!",

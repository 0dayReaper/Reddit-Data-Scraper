When I listen to a podcast before going to sleep I like to slow the speed but in Spotify, 0.5 is way too slow and 0.8 is still a bit too fast for me.\r  \n\r  \nYou have the volume boost which increases the volume of voices, while reducing background noise (I am getting older, I need this!!)\r  \n\r  \nYou can search a podcast with the RSS feed\r  \n\r  \nYou can set each podcast with a different \u201cSkip First\u201d and \u201cSkip Last\u201d.  So if a podcast always have let\u2019s say a 2 minutes intro, you can skip it automatically.  Same for the conclusion.\r  \n\r  \nThese are all options WITHOUT a subscription to the App.  I did paid for a while for the subscription but I didn't see any advantages for me.  You need a subscription to listen on a PC or if you want the \"cross device sync\" option. I din't need those features so I cancelled after a while.",

When I was listening on my phone's pocketxast app, I noticed a new feature that allowed me to skip to preset chapters within the episode.  How long has this been a thing? Does any other podcast do this?",

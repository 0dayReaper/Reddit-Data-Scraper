    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m looking for a podcast that has content that can start a conversation that\u2019s also funny. I\u2019m okay with interview style shows though I find they\u2019re often times either too serious or basically only interview comedians. Basically, I'm looking for shows like Hidden Brain, Radiolab, and Planet Money that actually have some humor to them. Something where an interesting topic is explored kind of like how The Dollop does with history but with other topics. Any recommendations are appreciated, thanks!",

It\u2019s the team discussing their 4 favourite facts of the week\u2026 and they just riff around each subject for 10 mins or so. The pod has been going about 10 years. It\u2019s ace and regularly tops the U.K. pod charts. It\u2019s great for sparking thoughts, discussions and the like.",

The only drawback is the audio levels are sometimes off and his co-host, though well meaning, is a bit of a mush mouth, so if your headphones aren't top notch, or you are listening amidst background noise, it can be hard to make out what he is saying.

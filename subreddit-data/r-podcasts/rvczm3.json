I know there have been a lot of radio shows over the years with this format, I'm wondering if anybody knows of any that are archived or have migrated to a podcast model. \n\nAnother one I enjoyed was the really old episodes of Coast To Coast AM, where the host took calls about ghosts and psychics and weird things like that.",

Made you feel connected more than just listening to a podcast does - there was spontaneity.",

Anyway he got really mad about it and by the fifth time he said \"you can't *do* that\" without offering a viable solution, he had started to also complain about feminists. The other host said, send separate emails. That's when I stopped listening.",

It was a fun show, but when all the callers were talking about old cars from 20 years ago (And this was when both were still alive, I think Tom was the one who passed away), I started to wonder if I was actually listening to a live show.  I think I stopped listening a couple years before Tom died, but I did come back and heard the Tom tribute show, which was great.  \n\nI have always wondered if the shows were taped when I was listening to them, did they just do the puzzlers live because those always seemed to show continuity.\n\nI think the thing I loved the most about this show was every single episode was 100% great vibes.  It was about two guys having fun talking about Cars and helping listeners out.  It was like enjoying good company at a bar or something and everything that was bad in the world just went away.  I would actually love to know if there is another show like that currently, but I'll look through this thread and see.",

His personality was akin to a real life Saul Goodman (not the crooked bits, but the charisma). His show was on News Talk 910 till they abruptly cancelled it in 2014. He tried to go the podcast route, but I don't think the medium was quite ready for a show like his (his show relying heavily on live calls). But, he did upload a bunch of his more popular episodes to his website. The archive can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.lentillem.com/podcasts/tag/Len+Tillem++radio+show\n\nI feel like his show would do so well nowadays, though it doesn't seem like he's been active on any online platform since 2018. :(",

The host\u2019s sense of humor is a little off-kilter and won\u2019t be for everybody \u2014 but if it is for you, the show has a dedicated cult following.\n\nEpisodes are recorded live some Tuesday nights (he decides this randomly and sends a Twitter blast when he\u2019ll be recording), and each have a theme that the host will banter with a caller about, for around 2-4 hours total. For example, one of the nights my friend called in for was centered around Steely Dan, and trying to get the host to enjoy them. It\u2019s very anything-goes, and often extremely funny. The host is in a comedy duo with Jon Wurster (drummer for Superchunk &amp; The Mountain Goats) who frequently calls in as characters to do long-form improv lore building for the imaginary town of Newbridge, NJ. These calls will often last 20 minutes or more, and are the best (or the worst) part of the show, depending on who you ask. You\u2019ll also get some other indie and leftfield guests: Kurt Vile has come on as a guest for at least a couple episodes, I seem to remember either Tim Heidecker or Eric Wareheim calling in one time, Benny Safdie has interacted with them on Twitter, you know, that flavor of guest.\n\nI\u2019ve never listened to Car Talk but The Best Show scratches this EXACT radio show format itch you spoke about, for me. There\u2019s also hundreds upon hundreds of hours to get into if it is your thing.\n\nGive it a shot! I never see people talking about this show so I\u2019m happy to have a prompt to sound off with. Hope you find the kind podcast you\u2019re looking for!",

I want to say it's on a college station, or maybe public radio since they're always taking about how broke the station is, lol. \n\nTotally apolitical, they have a theme every episode. Like what is your favorite color. But then they make it fun by asking callers additional questions, or if they get bored they'll change the topic mid episode.\n\nAnd there's regular callers they have fun with. Like one old man who calls in from Florida answering questions from his son (Scott) who's in prison for drug crimes. It's interesting to follow their story from episode to episode... we only get tiny crumbs but eventually the son gets released and calls in himself, he seems to be a stand up guy who admits his problems and is trying to redeem himself. But that's just a tiny part of it, maybe 2 minutes each episode. \n\nThey went off the air about a year ago, I miss them so much but their back catalogue is timeless.",

Probably best known for writing the story (that was also originally told on his show) that was made into \"A Christmas Story.\"\n\nThere is a podcast called The Brass Figlagee that collects a ton of recordings of his show.  Some are terrible quality and some are short excerpts but there's a LOT of good stuff there.\n\nOne of the greatest storytellers.  Hilarious and weird in all the right ways.",

It\u2019s an old song request show that has people calling in with relationship problems and Delilah gives them advice and plays an appropriate song. You might be able to still catch it late nights on your local easy listening station but she also has a podcast version.

They have a lot of different segments, which is nice because you can listen to just one segment or the whole show (at least on Apple Podcasts, not sure about others). They discuss the news, take listener calls, give out advice, etc., and the hosts basically share anything about their lives. Very little is off limits.\n\nIt took me a couple of episodes to get into it and to understand the hosts a bit more, but definitely worth a try since it sounds like what you\u2019re interested in.",

That should be unsurprising: they were the best talent for the job (not just anyone with a Yeti mic), they had production budgets and teams, they had secure incomes, and they had no commercial pressures.\n\nThese gold standard shows were mostly NPR/PBS/BBC and other public broadcasting corporations, which just goes to show how this new \"democratized\" and ultra-competitive content production age doesn't seem to lead to better innovations and better content.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, there are no shows like that anymore. Listen to the old stuff, it's gold, and then listen to it again. I don't mind at all hearing old Car Talk episodes, it's like hanging out with old friends.",

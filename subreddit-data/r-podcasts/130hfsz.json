I've really enjoyed The Harrowing, The Black Tapes, Treat, Lake Clarity, Down and Blackwood. I enjoyed The Magnus Archives at the start, but not so much as it progressed as I thought it went a bit over the top and ended up feeling somewhat goofy. I also couldn't get into The Sheridan Tapes or Strange Air. I'm not really into any Creepypasta or SCP, and I have no interest in Night Vale.",

For mystery stuff, I might recommend Passenger List, Alice Isn't Dead (a little horror-y), and the first season of Limetown (again, a little horror-y).",

                            "comment": "A bit of advice about Archive 81, which is my favorite audio drama:\n\nThe seasons are all radically different from each other, by design, but have the some of the same characters and exist in the same world. Season 1 is found footage horror and is very good but they're still finding their footing, season 2 is \"weird fiction\" like Mieville or VanderMeer, and a completely different beast, and season 3 is magical realism with an occult bent. You can probably get away with starting with any given season, especially season 3, which is very standalone except for the one-off episode \"The Golden Age\" which kind of sets the scene for it, and it's by far the strongest season. Lots of people bounced off season 2, because it's such a dramatic change in tone and style from season 1, but I loved it.\n\nA lot of Archive 81 doesn't *quite* get explained through narration or dialogue. Marc, who writes the podcast, said in an interview along the lines of \"Film is the medium for directors, books are the medium for writers, TV is the medium for producers, but podcasts are the medium for sound designers,\" and a lot of what they do in the show hinges on not ever telling you exactly what you're looking at, but instead doing some incredible sound design and letting your brain fill in the gaps.\n\nIt's really interesting -- Scott McCloud, a comic artist and someone who wrote a lot about comics, introduced the term \"closure\" about why comics can be so effective where other media sometimes can falter. Because comic books are a series of static images with the motion and the action only *implied*, it engages your brain and forces you to make up what happens between frames. You're not being told or shown, so you're an active participant in the narrative process. Archive 81 is sort of built on this, especially in season 2, where there are periods where some cosmic Lovecraftian thing, or Cronenberg body horror contraption is never really described, but you *hear* it, and you have to fill in the gaps of what it looks like and does for yourself, and it gets a bit abstract sometimes in doing this.\n\nIf you really liked The Black Tapes, I might suggest starting with season 1, but otherwise, I'd almost say listen to \"The Golden Age\" and then go right into season 3, and then go back to seasons 1 and 2.",

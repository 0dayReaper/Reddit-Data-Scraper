My overall anxiety is off the chart right now...plus I'm sad. I'm going to go out for a long walk soon, and while I'm out walking, I need a podcast that's easy to listen to, soothing, interesting, but not spiritual or religious. Not looking for humor right now. I just want to feel better. I'm up to date on The Moth, but even that isn't quite what I need right now.",

I find Starlee Kine's voice really nice to listen to and the concept of the show is pretty cool. She solves weird mysteries that people have, but it's as much about the process and the people she interviews than the answers themselves. Not sure if it's your thing, but I think it's pretty cool.",

    "postText": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/kax79wkdfspa1.jpg\n\nI\u2019m Jacob Silverman, the host of CBC\u2019s new podcast The Naked Emperor, which charts the stratospheric rise and fall of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. \n\nLast fall, Sam Bankman-Fried was a crypto tycoon. Only 31 years old, his empire \u2013 the crypto exchange FTX, the hedge fund Alameda Research, and a slew of mysterious companies scattered around the world \u2013 was worth an estimated $32 billion. \n\nSam wasn\u2019t like the other moguls. He was trusted. Investors, experts, and celebrities sang his praises. Tom Brady and Kevin O\u2019Leary endorsed him, regulators took selfies with him, and politicians met with him regularly on Capitol Hill. Though he lived in a luxury estate, Sam was cast as endearingly frugal. He drove a Toyota Corolla, he was an advocate for government regulation, and as FTX grew to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, he said he would give his billions away.\n\nBut instead, he lost it all, in what has been called \u201cone of history\u2019s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.\u201d Tens of billions of dollars wiped out. Millions of people held funds on FTX \u2013 now, they don\u2019t know where their money is. \n\nSam faces criminal charges that could send him to prison for the rest of his life. \n\nHow was SBF able to fool so many people into believing he was a genius? What can we learn from the disaster left in his wake?\n\nListen to The Naked Emperor, produced by the team that brings you Front Burner, CBC News and CBC Podcasts: \n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1353-the-naked-emperor",

That\u2019s an alleged theft, fraud. So in that sense, it\u2019s kind of simple.\n\nBut how did FTX acquire so much money? It was the crypto bubble, credit was cheap, and the numbers were going up. The hype was, well, insane, and everyone wanted in. One thing we noted in the podcast is that Kevin O\u2019Leary, of Shark Tank fame, told us that he trusted that other investors had already done appropriate due diligence into FTX. It was a hot ticket \u2013 investors desperately wanted to give FTX their money, and it was seen as a safe bet. That\u2019s how they got $2 billion in venture capital from some top firms.\n\nBut the bottom line answer is: during the 2020-2022 crypto bubble, a lot of people believed the hype and handed over real cash for digital tokens.",

He was called \u201cCC-1\u201d in the second superseding indictment against SBF. There\u2019s also the already notorious quote in there about CC-1 being told that he would have to do \u201c[woke shit for transactional purposes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3nwk/sam-bankman-fried-funded-woke-shit-for-transactional-purposes-prosecutors-allege)\u201d to help FTX\u2019s political program. In other words, an unnamed political operative was telling Nishad Singh to violate campaign finance laws by being a straw donor on behalf of FTX. Singh then went on to make some major donations to liberal causes.\n\nSingh\u2019s guilty plea is bad news for SBF, who obviously sits at the top of all this, but the unnamed political advisor and anyone else connected to SBF\u2019s political operation could be in trouble. Sean McElwee\u2019s relationship with SBF has been [pretty well chronicled](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/12/sam-bankman-fried-and-sean-mcelwees-fateful-alliance.html), so there\u2019s reason to think he might need a lawyer, but beyond that, it\u2019s all speculation who specifically might face charges.

The short answer about Trabucco is: no one really knows. Trabucco has been quiet since the FTX collapse \u2013 he famously bought a boat and left the company last summer.\n\nI can\u2019t speculate on Trabucco\u2019s legal status, but as you note, several top FTX and Alameda executives have pleaded guilty, people who were also Sam\u2019s friends and lived with him. Whether Trabucco was in that inner circle of trust, I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that whatever he knows would be of interest to prosecutors.\n\nAs Damian Williams, the US Attorney prosecuting the case, has said, this investigation is very much ongoing. I think there will be more arrests, more indictments, and probably more plea deals. Most of those people will be from FTX/Alameda/et al, but this is also now an investigation into political influence, campaign finance law violations, and (with the [most recent superseding indictment against SBF](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-charge-1.6793185)) alleged bribery of Chinese officials. \n\nA lot more to come.",

                    "comment": "I think the big questions with FTX \u2013 and with any crypto company that has shady financials \u2013 is where did the money come from, and where did it go? The real money, fiat dollars. FTX was allegedly Tether\u2019s biggest customer, purchasing $36 billion worth of stablecoins. That\u2019s a huge number, and it\u2019s still not clear if/how those transactions happened and if that amount of money really changed hands. Similarly, why did Alameda have [more than $1 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-charge-1.6793185) in accounts on Chinese crypto exchanges, as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged? [There\u2019s been reporting](https://www.ft.com/content/68dbe10a-fa38-443a-9790-dc96f2d8979a) that FTX/Alameda was working with high net worth individuals in Hong Kong and also dabbling in Cambodian crypto markets. There\u2019s simply a lot we still don\u2019t know about who they got money from, where it went, and who the company worked with.\n\nAnd what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto that seemed to leave FTX accounts the weekend it filed for bankruptcy? Another unknown!To really answer the question, though, I think US intelligence is becoming good at [mapping the movement of crypto](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/23/darpa-crypto-national-security/), looking at how [criminals](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) and [sanctioned regimes use it](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyp7vw/the-cia-is-deep-into-cryptocurrency-director-reveals), and interceding or seizing it when possible.But I don\u2019t really see the hand of US intelligence in the FTX case \u2013 beyond the fact, say, that the FBI will be an important part of the investigation. Still, the national security issues are much clearer and potentially of more interest to US intel agencies.",

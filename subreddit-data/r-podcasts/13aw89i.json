    "postText": "This question has probably been done a 100 times but I searched and couldnt find anything. So the question is. What are the best podcasts that discuss tv shows and movies? I would like something broad, so no podcast only about a certain tv show.  I would like them to talk about everything from old to new stuff, but preferable new stuff. Like the television or movie sub here on reddit.",

Unspooled breaks down top films; The Horror Virgin appeals to me because I love horror movies, though I'll admit that the Virgin can get a bit redundant with 'scared the shit out of me!'; Romancing the Pod is something I listen to almost exclusively because I like the rapport the hosts have - romance movies aren't really my thing.  \n\nAnd The Other Half is an interesting take on watching just 1/2 of a movie and trying to draw conclusions about what the other half of the movie presented/presents.      \n\nFor all of them though, I use them for recommendations of movies I might enjoy. My preference is looking at upcoming episodes and watching the movies before listening to the casts.  \n\nAll of them have massive spoilers, which doesn't really bother me for the romanticesque movies I don't care about, but can certainly ruin things for anyone who might watch whatever movie is being discussed.",

If you like 80s movies, my favorite is The Retro Cinema Podcast!  Heaps of fun.  For discussions about great films, both newer and older, Unspooled is wonderful.  And then there's the most up to date stuff in nice bite sized eps....Pop Culture Happy Hour!!!",

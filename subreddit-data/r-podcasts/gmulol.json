That's the strategy of Spotify.\n\nI am sort of okay, when podcasts release Spotify episodes before the regular episodes given they apparently benefit financially. but Exclusivity deals is an absolute no go.\n\nAnd Spotify should feel the heat for this destructive strategy.",

Moving to a dozen apps with a few shows on each would suck.  \n\nAnd even aside from the principle of it, I tried using the Spotify app a while back, it sucks.  It has barebon functions for playback,  which isn't too bad, the problem is it'd randomly run and hijack my media player.  As in, even if I only used the app once, days ago,  and had closed it an used other media apps since;  randomly when I press play on my headphone it'd play something on Spotify, forcing me to uninstall it completely.\n\nI hope this move doesn't become a trend...",

I like that the interface can be controlled mostly through swiping. I dunno, I just like that I can quickly queue things up, bring up the playback interface, flag and sort podcasts by various criteria, and it just works and looks good while doing it. I also bought the desktop app a long time ago so I can pick up playback of my queue on my PC. The silence skipping, speed adjustments, sound boost normalizing, and stats tracking are nice, though a lot of other apps have that (Spotify only has speed though lol). \n\nGranted it's not perfect. If connection is lost the app can't figure out what happened and will crash the download rather than picking it up later. It also has issues playing stuff back while downloading sometimes. Along with other podcatchers the app draws the playtime from the RSS feed rather than the actual file so some podcasts like Modern Love which adjust the ads on their entire archive will just cut out randomly because it's now actually longer than what the RSS feed says. That issue has been around for a long time but nobody seems keen to fix that so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nPocketcasts also did their infamous redesign that removed a lot of features and the developer acted like a Grade A+++++ asshole to everyone. Seriously some blood boiling stuff to read from back in the day. The redesign is mostly fixed now and I actually like the new interface better than the old one. Some people like a more utilitarian approach to their apps though. Podcast Addict is really really good for that and I recommend it to anyone who likes to bake their own cakes. There's ridiculous amounts of customization and the developer is super nice and responsive. I actually bought the app with some extra Play gift card money since I wanted to show support for the project haha. I just don't use it day to day because it's not as fluid to use as PocketCasts in my personal experience. \n\nOf course there's lots of other good apps out there. AntennaPod comes up a lot for being open source, and it works great, it's just not as fully featured as the others. Google Podcasts isn't the worst thing in the world (it's already on your android phone actually whether you've installed it or not) and it can sync with podcasts.google.com for transitioning between platforms. It's hilariously underfeatured and its taken Google *forever* to add the most most basic features... like seriously they just added queuing, groundbreaking stuff! \n\nLots of people will bring up their favorite once you start talking about this and that's fine. That's why I like the open nature of the RSS podcast. People can choose what they want, not get stuck with Spotify and nothing else.",

On top of that, he can(I don't recall if he does) do in-stream ads as part of those brand deals on youtube, which means he can still monetize that audience regardless.\n\nUnless he's an almost comically greedy motherfucker, I don't think he cares four fifths of five eighths of fuck all about youtube demonetization, except maybe in the philosophical sense.",

He was all about social distancing in the beginning when his guests were and then as time went on he had more and more fighters and comedians on who think its all overblown and then of course Elon Musk came back on last week so that didn't help. I of course say this as a long time fan of the show but the past few weeks have been quite a turning point for me. Not just for Rogan's show but a lot of those comedian podcasts. This whole thing just put a spotlight on just how out of touch with reality they all are.",

And don't tell me that \"there's always be a lot of smaller/independent guys around to listen to\". Many smaller creators would jump onto one of these platforms as soon as they provide them with easy sign-up and monetization. As more and more creators shift to these platforms, there will be less and less incentive for everyone else to invest their creative and technical efforts into independent podcasting. And all of us would be locked into juggling 3 shitty apps trying to enjoy our podcasts.\n\nJust look at what happened to RSS after the rise of Facebook and apps. You would be lucky to find an RSS feed link on most websites now, and even if you do - no modern browser has built-in reader/viewer. \"Follow us on Facebook\" my ass!\n\nSo, if you don't want this to happen (or at least postpone it as long as possible) - DONATE TO YOUR FAVORITE CREATORS REGULARLY!!!",

I'm already not a fan of them, and hate the way they're fragmenting the ecosystem. \n\nI'm not a fan of Joe Rogan, but I did listen to a good bit of LPOTL. Trouble is, I listened sporadically. My podcast app kept track of which episodes I'd heard and which I hadn't. It also let me play my most recent unheard episode hands free, which is a big deal for me since I do most of my listening at work in a biohazard safety lab, and I can't just take out my phone to queue something up. \n\nWith LPOTL, I've just fallen off listening. With the convenience hit, I've just filled in the gap with some other shows. But if this becomes a more widespread trend, I'll have to figure it out. I can keep myself entertained while dropping 1 or 2 shows. But if it's a dozen, then I'm out of luck. \n\nHow do I go about continuing to listen to Spotify's exclusive shows without benefiting Spotify at all?",

Google (owners of Youtube) are actively planning to migrate Google Play Music to Youtube Music by the end of the year. \n\nMy guess is that Spotify knows of Google's plan to consolidate audio and video streaming and plans aim right for the jugular. \n\nWhat do you think?",

You wouldn\u2019t be complaining if he only had left wingers on over and over again. Talking to right wingers isn\u2019t as bad as people make it sound\n\nOn a side note, why would it be his responsibility to challenge his guests? Why can\u2019t we have listeners be able to tell what\u2019s truth and what\u2019s fiction? It doesn\u2019t hurt people to hear other points of view. It\u2019s up to the individual to decide whether or not they believe it and whether or not they agree. Podcasters/interviewer don\u2019t owe people anything\n\nP.S.

So that\u2019s the end of the Rogan Podcast for me. I like some of the interviews he does but have no interest in UFC fighters or anything to do with UFC, so I won\u2019t miss any of that. And I\u2019m pretty sick of the all the nonsense about getting blood work done all the time, and vitamin drips, and diet advice, which I don\u2019t really need or want. I also get a bit tired of listening to \u2018comics\u2019 blowing each other\u2019s trumpets, talking about how they\u2019ve been grinding for decades and payed their dues. Oh well, goodbye Joe!",

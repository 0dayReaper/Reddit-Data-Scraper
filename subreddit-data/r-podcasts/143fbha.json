    "postText": "I'm looking to branch out and listen to some history/news styled podcasts that take a look at mental health during big tragedies. I often wonder if people got really depressed over tragedies in human history as the times they took place, like environmental disasters, wars, world wars, plauges, etc. And how they managed stress and dealt with the depression and anxiety and feelings of hopelessness during those times. In other words \"how human beings dealt with mental illness during times of tragedy\". Anyone know of any podcasts that tackle this subject?",

This isn\u2019t a direct answer to your question\u2014she doesn\u2019t have a podcast. However, if you\u2019re wrestling with climate anxiety, as many of us are, I recommend checking out her work. She has some courses on the insight timer app.",

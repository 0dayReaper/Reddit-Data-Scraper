    "postText": "I'm running low on podcasts.   I have my usual stable of informative podcasts including Stuff You Should Know, Freakonomics, No Stupid Questions, Planet Money, ....  However, I have few captivating story type podcasts.   In the past, I have really enjoyed some particular podcasts in this genre.  However, the majority I've tried haven't really hit the mark.   Many feel like generic true crime that doesn't really catch my interest.  The podcasts in which each episode is a different story rarely catch my interest.  I'd like a full season dedicated to really interesting story. Both fiction and non-fiction are okay.   Some examples that I especially enjoyed are below.   All are season 1 unless otherwise noted.\n\n* The Left Right Game (This may be favorite,  In my real life, I enjoy hiking/exploration and discovering unique and interesting places, so this type of story really works for me.)\n* Dirty John\n* Dr. Death\n* Borrasca\n* Limetown\n* S-Town\n* Dust:  CHRYSALIS  (the one in which AI awakens to find human race destroyed)\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions of other podcasts I may enjoy?",

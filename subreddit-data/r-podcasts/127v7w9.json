    "postText": "I just finished the short 10 episode podcast Conviction: American Panic. It\u2019s absolutely insane and talks about the wrongful convictions of more than 200 people during the Satanic Panic wave in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThis podcast is 2 years old so I\u2019m not sure if anyone has listened to it recently, but it\u2019s so wild and heart wrenching that you should listen to it right now.\n\nI had no idea how much influence the Satanic Panic had on people\u2019s lives during that time. And it really makes me frustrated at our professionals who unknowingly or knowingly destroyed these peoples lives.",

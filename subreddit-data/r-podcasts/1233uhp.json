    "postText": "Normally, I don't get scared listening to paranormal stories, but this podcast, man...I had to turn it off for a bit when I realized I was genuinely becoming afraid of the dark. It's basically a series about a true haunted house. The host lived there, and she's got quite a few interviews with others who lived there as well, both with her and at different times. \n\nAnyways, I just finished all 13 episodes and want to talk about it! &gt;!Especially the part where she goes BACK to the house at the end of the podcast. I'm like, \"Girl, what are you doing?\" She said she hadn't wanted to do this because she was afraid of inviting whatever was in that house back into her life, and I was thinking, \"No shit!\" !&lt;\n\n&gt;!And then of course it did come back into her life and that visit sounded horrible.  It's pretty wild she's still doing the podcast.!&lt;",

I suspect she is just using the experience as a narrative device to propel the story and listeners' interest into s2. Not saying she made it up, but that she's choosing to attach deeper significance to an ambiguous event rather than dismiss it as a nightmare. But indeed who knows?!\n\nAnyway, thanks for the recommendation. I really enjoyed that and am now alert to watching my two black cats' every whisker twitch in the old Victorian house I live in that never scared me at night until now!!",

Idk if it's the dialog, like the Elvis/Johnny Cash line, that's doesn't come off as genuine or \"real\" at all.\n\nEdit: yea definitely the writing for me.  Can't do it.  The retelling of when she met \"her future abuser\" was cringe bad.  High school creative writing bad. \n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it!  And hope others do  too...I just couldn't get into it",

I made it through all the episodes but felt a lot of second hand embarrassment when she got cringingly over dramatic. She also would re-direct dialogue to make it all about her. The dramatics, combined with the self absorbed storytelling wrecked the credibility of her experience for me. It felt like she was pitching a screen play with a set up for a sequel at the end.",

Loved how it was a serial podcast, and I kept wondering what would happen next in the story. \n\nAlso, at a certain point I decided to only listen to it in my car because I didn't want to summon that awful night hag thing into my home by listening to the podcast there lol. Part of that is because when that movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose came out, my roommate and I watched it in the theater and were scared shitless. After we returned from that movie, we started hearing weird sounds from the kitchen, like cabinets shutting or the toaster popping up. My roommate also started waking up at 3 am every night.

Also, the way I found the pod was because I heard the host, Lindsey, interviewed on Real Hauntings podcast, which has a few paranormal agnostic people for hosts who just find paranormal stories interesting, but don't necessarily believe them. She sounded sincere, not to mention has a bunch of witnesses to back her up. Some of the weird stuff I experienced was with other people too, which reassures me I'm not just delusional.\n\nMaybe they're all actors and it's a hoax. Actually that would be for the best. I just don't have evidence for that, but maybe I should do some googling before i fall hook, line and sinker. I saw Blair Witch when it came out, never thought it was real or found it scary. I thought the lead character with the camera was so annoyingly self-indulgent to constantly be filming that it was rather ridiculous lol. But I do remember people freaking out thinking it was real. Also yes! The H.G. Wells alien story is a trip.\n\nI won't try to convince you to listen to the pod or believe it. In fact, maybe it's better you don't pay it any mind. The world is fucked up enough that we don't need to focus on all this evil shit, intriguing as it is. That's how wary I am of inviting dark, paranormal stuff back into my life. I still find it fascinating, but honestly I don't miss having it around and I don't think everyone who claims to have experienced something is making it up (although some certainly are). Thanks for your comment. I think your intentions are to be reassuring, and that's kind and I do appreciate it!",

I agree with you that this seems to be her real-life experiences. \n\nI'm on episode 4 now and although her narration is scripted (by her), the interviews with her friends and husband are very natural and definitely not scripted or acted as far as I can discern. Also the contributors she speaks to are real. I looked up the Oxford professor who's an expert in night terrors, sleep paralysis and disorders etc. He's legit and not an actor. All their bios are on the Chilling website too.\n\nEdit: Guy Leschziner. He's a professor at King's College London, not Oxford. He studied medicine at Oxford.",

The cringey over dramatics and self absorbed storytelling ruined the credibility of her experience for me. \nHer life always seemed to be threatened by someone or something. The police tell her that her ex is going to kill her and then she\u2019d kidnapped out of her college art class by her ex and her professor chases after them and scare her ex away. Then her professor looks at her and says \u201cHe was going to kill you, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Her solution to this very serious threat was to move to another house with her 2 best friends and keep them with her at all times, like they\u2019ll be able to save her from a jilted, mentally unstable ex who is on a mission to end her life and is stalking her. \nBut the house they move into is haunted by a demon that chooses to torment her the most out of the 3 roommates. She needs the protection of all her friends, her boyfriend and God to keep her safe. Then she learns to use a psychic projection to protect her friends from the entity and views this heroic act as the least she can do since they had to protect her from her abusive ex\u2026 it\u2019s all just too much. The house may have had some paranormal activity but I think she greatly exaggerated it, along with the other events of her life.\nThe whole thing sounded more like she was reading a script she wrote for a movie, with a sequel set up at the end. In fact, the ending was the icing on the cake that she was making most of this up. \nIf anyone listens to Jim Harold\u2019s Campfire podcast, she is featured on ep. 597, telling another made-up sounding paranormal story. It\u2019s a story about when her dad was young, he prayed asking for a sign that God was real and his prayer was answered that day when he got a divine symbol on a cracker Jack prize. Which is later confirmed to somehow be a legit prize made by the company even though she also says they have no record of that prize ever being made as single prize or on mass market.",

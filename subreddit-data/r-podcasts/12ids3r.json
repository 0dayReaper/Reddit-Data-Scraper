They make him watch a few episodes of a series or a new anime movie every week and then they give their reviews/synopsis. It's entertaining, if you don't mind your favourite shows being heavily criticized \ud83e\udd23",

So they also talk about Japan and the gaijin experience, but they well cover manga/anime/doujins/hentai/ etc.  I think all 3 hosts have been presenters at the Crunchyroll awards and panelists at Anime Expo, so they're definitely in the community",

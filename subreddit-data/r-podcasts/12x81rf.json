During the 80s and 90s I consumed a lot of music through my Walkman and then Discman. \n\nBut once I discovered audiobooks and podcasts, I hardly listen to music anymore. When I\u2019m exercising, doing chores, driving, I much prefer to turn on a podcast. It\u2019s not that I dislike music, but I enjoy podcasts more. \n\nI don\u2019t know anyone else in my life like this. What about you guys?",

            "comment": "Just heard an ad on my local NYC station for the podcast A Break In The Case. Some of you may remember it did a short series of podcasts based on a single crime case investigated and solved by the NYPD. What made it unique was that it was an NYPD produced podcast. Have other police departments ever done their own podcasts before? It was SURPRISINGLY excellent with very high production value, great interviews with the actual participants (who all have great NYC accents) and each episode had it\u2019s own well crafted arc that told an essential element of the story with its own beginning middle and end, a RARITY in true crime since most true crime podcasts allow their pre-chosen format to dictate story structure as opposed to building the structure around the story. ( we\u2019ve all heard podcasts that are much longer than they need to be because they are trying to stretch the story to fill the segment)  ANYWAY the sad thing about that great podcast is that it completely vanished after its initial outing. Despite promising new cases it simply went radio silent without explanation.  But this morning I heard an ad for a new season dropping and I can not wait to jump in. I think it\u2019s been three years since the first case? Maybe four.",

It\u2019s over now, and I\u2019m kind of hoping for a recommendation to fill the gap it\u2019s left. They were about half an hour long (I\u2019m not opposed to longer episodes), usually one case a week, and a mix of true crime/paranormal/unexplained, with more of an emphasis on the true crime. The occasional spook episode did a good job to break up the heaviness.",

(One of the hosts, Ryan Broderick has a very good substack called Garbage Day which, again, isn't exactly what you're looking for.) But then you also have specific episodes of Reply All like [\\#77 The Grand Tapestry of Pepe](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8ho8a) or that one time on a Yes Yes No they [talked about what a milkshake duck is](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/brhog4).",

(I really liked the Chris Mannix and Howard Beck pod too but Beck left, and he was the big reason I liked it.)\n\nFor consistency and frequency, it\u2019s hard to top The Hoop Collective.  The three hosts have great chemistry.\n\nZach Lowe on The Lowe Post is probably the smartest of them, but after like a decade of listening to him I start to find his pod a tad uneven in the last year.  He\u2019s great tho.\n\nThe Old Man\u2026 is JJ Redick\u2019s pod, and he just pulls the curtain on the game in a way few can.  His recent ep with Richard Jefferson was really great.",

I catch him on the Tony Kornheiser pod, but I heard his podcast is very good.\n\nThe Bill Reiter: Reiter Than You is a general sports podcast, but he has some good NBA guests weekly. It is a podcast produced by Audacy (spelling correction incuded).",

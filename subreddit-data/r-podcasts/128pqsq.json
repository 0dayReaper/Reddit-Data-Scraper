I\u2019ve considered building a small storm shelter/bunker to fit 2-3 people with water and canned goods, but that\u2019s a TON of money I don\u2019t have atm. Maybe something later in life if it\u2019s not too late haha. The subject is pretty interesting regardless if everyone agrees on it.",

Graham is an investigative journalist who is investigating the Younger Dryas impact theory (comet hitting the earth causing ice age melt). Fascinating to listen to. Randal is a geologist and researches the same theory. There\u2019s another episode with John Reeves who found thousands of mammoth tusks in a 5 acre plot in Alaska that may further support this theory.",

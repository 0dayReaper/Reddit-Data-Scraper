More like Rabbit Hole that another commenter mentioned",

It doesn\u2019t explicitly draw the line to current events, but It\u2019s very alarming. \n\nOne criticism is that it doesn\u2019t go enough into the ATF/FBI/DOJ stupidity, arrogance and hubris, but then again, that isn\u2019t the story it seeks to tell. \n\nI got hooked over the weekend, because I was shocked to learn that there were still true believing Branch Dravidians, and some were Q-adjacent.",

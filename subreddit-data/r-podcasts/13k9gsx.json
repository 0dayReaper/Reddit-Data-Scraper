    "postText": "Edit: SOLVED. Caustic Soda!! Highly recommend to everybody. \n\nThis has been driving me crazy for years. Back in 2017 a podcast was recommended to me by someone I met briefly and I absolutely loved it. I believe that it had already ended by the time I started listening in 2017. What I can remember: the person who recommended it to me was Canadian and knew at least one of the hosts from his town (I believe somewhere in BC). There were three male hosts/friends who could cover all sorts of topics--natural disasters, crime, weird history, etc. I can specifically remember episodes on volcanoes and lightning.  I hadn't listened to it in quite a while and then lost the feed when I switched to a different podcast app. I know it's a long shot given how little I remember, but any guesses would be greatly appreciated!",

One of my favorites back around 2012-2014ish, when I got back into pods in 2018 I was really sad to see they shut down.\n\nI just looked and it appears episodes are still available. Also in 2021 they did a 3hr special when one of the hosts died.",

    "postText": "So, I like murder mysteries. You know what I don't like? How the true crime genre, as a whole, has affected the grieving families of real life murder victims. So I don't want to contribute to that by listening to true crime podcasts. Got any recommendations for murder mystery podcasts that's purely fictional? They don't even have to be murder, just mystery.\n\nthey could be talking about mystery books that someone else have written, or they could actually be stories written solely for the podcast.",

Innocent people were being doxxed and harassed and it was gross. \n\nI like things like dateline, 20/20. Stuff that does it from a real investigative journalist angle. \n\nThere was a girl I went to high school with and something tragic happened to her family. This was before social media days. Well one of those big true crime channels did a thing in her. And the viewers flocked to find her social media. \n\nNice to see someone else who thinks a lot them is just exploiting the victims for entertainment.",

Funny but reverent towards growing and self compassion. \nEpisodes I recommend:\nHow to Heal with Alex Elle\nHow to Come Home to Yourself with Martha Beck\n\nAlso recc Dear Sugars. More of an advice show with male and female hosts. Shows are of people writing in letters that they discuss. Many topics, all great. \n\nThey both cover a huge amount of self help &amp; growth type topics with the support of professional guest speakers like writers, doctors, therapists, life coaches, athletes, etc. \n\nThey are not tooooo serious.  I do think first podcast could be relatable more to women than men, but single or married mother or childless- all topics covered.",

            "comment": "Pardon My Take is maybe the best all-around podcast for dudes just kicking it, being funny, and talking about all major sporting events. And they\u2019re also pretty knowledgeable and have great guests. \n\nSimilar to that pod but for football, Around the NFL is my go-to. And then for college football it\u2019s hands-down CBS Sports\u2019s Cover 3. \n\nI don\u2019t really do basketball, so I got nothing there. \n\nIf you\u2019re into baseball, Talkin\u2019 Baseball from Jomboy Media is the one. \n\nAs far as some other general faves, I like The Right Time with Bomani Jones, The Business of Sports with Andrew Brandt, and then I\u2019ll casually do an episode or two of Tony! (Tony Kornheiser) and Dan Patrick per week. \n\nIf you have hyper-fandom of one particular team, I highly suggest searching \u201cLocked On\u201d. There\u2019s a podcast for every fan of every team basically. And they\u2019re all pretty solid.",

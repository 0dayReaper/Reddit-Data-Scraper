    "postText": "I'm sick of podcasts appealing to the mainstream; I like weird, bizarre, multicultural, niche, and obscure. The big networks don't make these, because, well of course they don't. They want to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nThe problem is many people think some pods or topics are obscure or far from the mainstream when they aren't. Stuff They Don't Want You To Know has capitalized on this as a business model; it's a podcast about things people in power don't want you to know, I mean their last episode was about the Fox News and baby powder lawsuits, not exactly obscure exciting information.\n\nThen the other problem is Reddit's paranoia with not allowing self promotion. In principal that's a good rule for getting rid of spam and I support it in theory, but it makes finding new podcasts hard. Oh, another thread where 20 people recommend You're Wrong About? Oh joy.\n\nI am not asking for conspiracy theory podcasts or pods by unhinged people (unless they're funny to listen to). I'm asking for weird shit. A good example is Leguizamarama, a podcast about everything John Leguizamo has done including like Papa John's commercials. That's the kind of weird shit that's perfect for the podcast format, and I want more of it.",

It's much harder to find good obscure podcasts.\n\nTry \"til death do us Blart\" - 5 guys made a pact that they'd watch Paul Blart mall cop 2 every year near Thanksgiving and record a podcast episode about it until they die. They're on like year 6 and descending into madness.",

And the stories, let me tell you, some of them will continue to scratch your brain and keep you up at night, and I can bet they will be stories you probably have never heard before.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of the strange dark and mysterious, there's Mr. Ballen... he is THE BEST in TRUE CRIME STORYTELLING but his podcast is exclusively on Amazon. Free to download. However he has a TON of content on YouTube.\n\nOh also Deathbed Confessions.... But that one is a Spotify exclusive.",

Harmony is trans and went through puberty as a boy in the 90s so they compare and contrast notes on movies like Mean Girls, Drive Me Crazy, etc. It's good fun, the hosts are lovely and they have some pretty good guests.",

Podcast, and yet they are three favorites of mine (although none of the above have had new episodes in about a year now). Tastes in podcasts are also wildly different and polarizing so what is strange/obscure/niche could be super interesting to one person could be so unbearable to another they won\u2019t recommend it.\n\nYou\u2019re probably getting the same answers recommending mainstream/popular podcasts since they are the ones most people listen to and they probably don\u2019t listen to too many others. Unfortunately the best way I\u2019ve found to find niche &amp; obscure podcasts is to stumble upon them spontaneously or occasionally seeing what is going on in threads here. You have to do a lot of sifting, but you will find some gems!",

[Here's an example](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/hear-here). \n\nIn my experience, they don't list very *obscure* and/or indie stuff - but they are a good way of discovering new podcasts. If your problem is you want a very specific vibe that only comes from small indie creators, then newsletters might not be ideal for you. But if your problem is you're bored of the same recommendations and just want something new to listen to, podcast newsletters are a good way to explore\n\nEdit: I saw you mentioned elsewhere that your podcast app always gives you the same recommendations. I don't know what app you're using - but exploring other apps with potentially better recommendation engines might be a good idea? Mine lets me change my location - it's always fun to see what podcasts are popular in say South Africa, and there's likely to be at least a couple that you haven't heard of (unless you're from South Africa I guess!)",

    "postText": "A buddy of mine was a music critic for a major newspaper back when newspapers used to sell. He would tape every interview and then write his story. So literally no one other than himself has ever heard any of these interviews. The interview guests range from A list musicians such as Ray Charles/Billy Joel to more obscure like Guided By Voices.\nIf you had these tapes would you release them on a podcast? \n\nBTW My buddy owns the rights to these tapes and is willing to go the podcast route.\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Done deal and we are going to make this happen. Be back in a month or two with a link to the first episode.\n\nEdit 2: FYI there are also other entertainers interviewed. Like George Carlin, Dick Clark, Marc Maron, Aaron Sorkin, Bryan Cranston, and others. :)\n\nEdit 3: Podcast is now up https://www.thetapesarchive.com/",

If the interview is a clear and obvious interview, then it's pretty understood that there is implied consent and you're going to be hard pressed to win a challenge to  that in a court in the US, at least. Newspapers, radio stations, etc all publish interviews all the time without any form of written consent. I've been interviewed a number of times for the news, and never once been asked to give written - or even oral - consent, nor did I expect it. (This shouldn't be construed to be advice that others shouldn't bother getting consent in their endeavors. Written consent is great, but even oral consent while recording is useful, and it only serves to help protect you Just In Case.)\n\nThe exception to this rule is if it ISN'T an obvious interview. Like, if it was the two people out to lunch, and one of them tossed their phone on the table in record mode without saying anything. There's an expectation of privacy there that would put you in danger, not to mention all-party consent laws that may apply depending on the state.\n\nThere actually is one other exception, though it's fairly rare, which is if the artist and original interviewer had agreed to editorial oversight of the interview - allowing the artist to strike certain things after recording before it's released. Those arrangements are always documented, and you could be held in breach of that if you released the interview without honoring it, even if you weren't party to the agreement (otherwise people would just get around this all the time). Even if you could win the overall legal challenge on those grounds, they probably have enough money to keep you tied up in court long enough for it to not matter.\n\nOkay, but seriously, there's ONE MORE exception - editing. If the interview has been cut and edited to change the spirit or meaning of something someone said in an interview, it can open the person releasing it to a defamation lawsuit. If you didn't edit the interview, you might not know what the people who originally recorded it did. This is probably an incredibly small risk, but it's just one more thing to consider.",

So as soon as they heard that you were making money off them, even be it a hundred dollars, they would come after you.  Even if they didnt have a case they would come after you and hope that you settle and that they could win something.  Even though they already have a million dollars, they would still come after you to steal your hundred dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Gene Simmons is a dick and should rot in hell",

The RFK tapes is another good example of using older audio. \n\nPodcasts may be the best way to deliver the media, no one listens to radio.  This sounds very interesting and I hope this happens.",

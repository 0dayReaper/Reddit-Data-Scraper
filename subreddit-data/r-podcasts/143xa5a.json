    "postText": "I started watching MrBallen last summer. I soon discovered he has a podcast, and l would listen to that every Monday while I was at work. Honestly, I think I enjoyed the podcast more than the videos.\n\nUnfortunately for me (but good for him), MrBallen has a contract with Amazon making his podcast an Amazon exclusive. In November, he took every episode of the podcast off of YouTube. I wasn't able to listen to all of them before that. Honestly, I don't want to subscribe to Amazon just for one podcast. \n\nI haven't listened to true crime podcasts or YouTube videos since November or December. Lately, though, I've been itching to get back into the genre. However, I miss MrBallen's storytelling style. Do you know any podcasts that have a similar vibe?",

Some stories were so violent and disturbing, I had to unsubscribe. He\u2019s a great storyteller but how he doesn\u2019t have nightmares\u2026he must.",

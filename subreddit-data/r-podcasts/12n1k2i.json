    "postText": "Hello everybody,\n\nI'm pretty new in the podcast universe.\n\nI'm looking for some men oriented pshychology or relationship podcast or youtube channels to listen to.\n\nLately I was listening Adam Lane Smith and I like his style.\nI also like Kirk Honda from \"Psychology in Seattle\", but most of the time he comments and analyses american tv shows (i'm not american). I find that Alan Robarge is quite boring to listen to, and I don't particularly like his style.\n\nWhat podcast or youtube channel would you recommend me?",

His older YouTube videos and lectures might be better than his podcast, a lot of his podcast is about politics and culture war now and not really helpful.\n\nI used to listen to Art of Charm back in the day. Not necessarily men oriented but it provides a lot of insight into relationship building",

But I can give you an example if you want.\n\nEnforced monogamy - when Peterson talks about it he\u2019s talking about a \u201ccultural enforcement\u201d. Thing is we already have societies where enforced cultural monogamy is the norm; Sharia states, Jehovah witness\u2019s, Amish etc.\n\n\nAnd they don\u2019t really do that well when you\u2019re trying to enforce monogamy. \n\nBut if you don\u2019t care about a Reddit moron posting, then by all means:\n\nhttps://medium.com/s/story/jordan-peterson-is-a-very-poor-researcher-whose-own-sources-contradict-his-claims-464633558b75\n\nThis article is pretty much on Peterson\u2019s fellowship getting rescinded by Cambridge University, the whole fellowship was made by a couple of requests by Peterson and networking towards some colleagues of his. Now this is fine and perfectly natural, there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting your way by simply networking. That\u2019s actually how you usually do get opportunities in any business.\n\nSo, this isn\u2019t where Peterson is twirly Dick Dastardly haha, but the reason why it was rescinded because the fellowship was backlashed by faculty and students but Peterson claims that his backlash was by cowards and bureaucrats. Followed by more outlets of the conservative variety goes as far as naming the critics as petulant careerist.\n\nNow the whole narrative is that Peterson is a controversial but needed in the academic world. But the issue is that he\u2019s not even relevant on the academic front. Peterson uses sacred texts without the historical context and that alone is dangerous in the world. Without the said context, quotes and texts from authors can at least be used in any way shape or form to formulate your own argument. Especially when the authors are popularizers of myth as stated in the article I linked.\n\nNow what\u2019s the issue with this? It\u2019s just arguments right? Well no, the issue is that Peterson just uses these myths to suggest his own personal view as a mirror of natural evolution.\n\nNow there\u2019s more criticisms revolving around Jordan Peterson but I think we\u2019re out of time. \n\nI would rather read on the criticisms than hear someone keep telling me that this person is a genius. Politics or not. Now you can be a cultural renegade, it\u2019s actually MORE HUMAN to do so lol! But, you gotta be correct about it. And you can\u2019t sound like a crazy person.\n \nYou can listen to him by the way, you ain\u2019t really ruining the world or someone\u2019s sleep if you do. You\u2019re an adult you can clearly make any decision you want, just note that just because you can make any decision. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna stop me from reacting of whatever I feel ^^!",

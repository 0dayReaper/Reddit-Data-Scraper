    "postText": "I've been to rehab 7 times. Whoop-de-doo. People that haven't been to rehab and only know about it from MTV shows have a common misconception that it's a sad place. Whenever I've started to tell people a story from rehab they get a somber look on their faces. Uh, no. Rehab was the most fun I've ever had in my life. It's the most egregiously human thing anyone can take part in. It's like being a part of some insane social experiment. \n\nTake people off the street, detox them from drugs then throw them into a place they can't leave where they eat, sleep, discuss, cry, and laugh together. As they recover from detox their bodies become alive with energy and clarity (the so-called pink cloud). They're extremely bored with nothing to do besides sit through lectures and interact with other people going through the same thing. They become kids again. Hijinks ensue. Then they tell a story about watching their best friend die. It's wild. \n\nRelationships develop at incredible speeds. Think about how much time you spend with a friend. You spend 12 hours a day with each other. Sometimes one of them will get kicked out or get fed up and leave and it's like watching your brother walk out of your life. \n\nSo I want to know if anyone knows of a podcast or any rehab stories. I miss it. I'd go back just for the human connection if I could. When rehab ends it all seems like a weird dream.",

It's more an individual thing honestly and very hard to gauge the success of a group of people.\n\n A lot of people go to rehab because they have no other choice. It's when you wanna give up the drugs but can't seem to figure out how to do it alone. It's when you've tried all sorts of treatments but none of them work. It's when you want to stop but you just can't. You tell yourself this is the last time but a few hours later you're already fantasizing about the next hit. It's when you'd rather give up food, friends, your own dignity, your family just so you can feel high again even for just a day.",

                                    "comment": "The staff, the structure, and the funding all make a difference. \n\nThe staff can either be very into it or not. It's easy to tell. There are always one or two that very much care for their clients, people that have been sober for decades that can't see themselves working any other place. They're the ones that take people aside and talk to them when they have an outburst and show them compassion instead of discipline. Then there are the ones that are there because it's a job. They're bored, annoyed, and condescending to the clients. They're dangerous too. One rehab I was at, there was a woman who had the night shift. All she had to do was make sure no one left their rooms. I never left my room, so I was surprised when they fired her for giving \"sexual favors\" for clients and letting them use her weed vape pen. \n\nThe structure can vary in terms of how much freedom, entertainment, and rule enforcement there is. The standard rehab is a 30/60/90 day stay. They follow state guidelines. They have required curriculum. They have counselors with degrees in social work and psychology. Freedom is limited. If you walk out of a certain door, you can't come back in. \n\nThey usually take everyone out for a scheduled, supervised walk that may include a stop at a convenience store for snacks. If they allow smoking there will be scheduled and supervised smoke breaks. To get cigarettes you have to give money to a staff member who will go out and buy the cigarettes everyone wants like a lunch order at an office. If smoking isn't allowed they offer patches or lozenges. \n\nThere are some places that let you leave if you want and come back, but they're not the typical rehab, they're not state run, they're ran by a charity and they're faith based. I spent the longest of my time in rehab at those places, over a year in total. They let you check out and do what you want but as soon as you're back you get breathalyzed and UA'd (pee test). My friends would go out to eat or go see a movie. It's a long stay at those places, 6 months to graduate, and you live there, so there is trust built up at stages where they let you leave. \n\nThe entertainment options for what clients do between classes and meals can make or brake a place. Some places have next to nothing. Every place has books but the selection is what makes it. I like reading so I spent 90% of my free time reading books. Some places had a limited selection. Some places had a vast selection. One place I was at, the selection was so limited that I ended up stealing and sneaking in books a little at a time to read which is another story. Some places have guitars and keyboard and you'll find some very gifted musicians there which kinds breaks your heart that they are there in the first place all over again. There's usually a tv or two at these places with scheduled tv and movie times and restrictions on what you can watch. The last place I was at, they had a Roku TV, and they allowed us to go ok YouTube and play any music we wanted. That made a huge difference in everyone's happyness. I think that decision made that rehab one of the best places I've ever been to. It also got out of hand because people would play very offensive music and it ticked off the staff and others. It was disrespectful. \n\nFunding. How much money the state is giving these places really shows. The worst rehab I went to (the one with the lady giving sexual favors) obviously had very poor funding. There were cockroaches in the showers. The mattresses were thin pads. The book selection was sad. The food was terrible. The place was falling apart. Most of the staff was just there for a paycheck. They didn't really care except for one or two of them. For example, we watched Blow on a movie night. The Johnny Depp cocaine movie. I couldn't believe it. The place was just sad. People fought. People were cliqued up. It was like a softer version of jail. I hated it and everyone else did too. \n\nAll of these things make a rehab better or worse than the next one but honestly what really matters is how much self discipline you're willing to put yourself through to stay alive. It depends on where your life is at. If you have no options left and if you walk out of that door and leave you're making yourself homeless then you make the decision to stay. If you have a place to live and family still in your life then yeah, you can leave. It can be the shittiest rehab in the world but if you're stuck there, you have to get through it. I had to go through that shitty rehab I was talking about because I was stuck there. I didn't even live in the state it was in. I *ended up* there hundreds of miles away from my home. There is a story for how I ended up there but it's not a fun or cool story, it's the saddest story I've got I'm not telling it to anyone. But I got out of it and I got back home because if I didn't I was going to die. \n\nSo I guess that's what makes a rehab, the clients, people who want to live more than they want to die.",

I can\u2019t live here and ik I can\u2019t drink and be successful\n\nI hate the rehab cycle they put you on. Detox, 20 day placement at a holding facility, then sober house, so a 12-step fraternity. With a lot of people who are honestly dumbasses. In early sobriety I am shockingly agreeable but I just want to be alone and live my life\n\nThey make money out of people like me. The whole AA philosophy is very problematic and I have tried it. Why decrease the self-esteem of some who already is insecure? Someone who cycles in their drinking and is poor. I\u2019ve already been humbled by life. I wish I knew a state facility but idk of any here",

People that believe there is a \"higher power\" and that everything good that happens is all thanks to that higher power. The truth is that it's all you. You get your own ass out of trouble. You control your actions. You live out the consequences. \n\nWhat AA is good for is social contact. That's what really keeps people coming back and why it makes them feel good to go. A lot of addicts struggle a lot when they're alone so having some other person be a part of their recovery (like a sponsor) is what works for them. Having a home group, getting to know people, that's what helps them. \n\nI'm not so much that way. And I don't think I'm better for it either. I could be part of a home group and have friends but I have some very serious self-esteem and anxiety issues that make it damn near impossible for me to integrate myself into any group of people. I suffer from an overwhelming sense of \"I don't belong\" whenever I go to one of those meetings and so staying away from those I get more peace. \n\nMaybe you've heard of SMART recovery? It's all about self management. You are the higher power. You analyze your thoughts and feelings and deternine what the best choice is. I'd recommend that to you. \n\nYou're not hopeless. You have something a lot of people don't have in rehab, an education and experience.\n\nAnother bit of advice, try not to dwell too much on the money making aspect of it. Yeah, they're making money off you. Everyone is. Your job, your school, the things you buy, etc. There is value to be gained by going. Think about that. You have a place to go when it's done, a sober house. That's HUGE. That can very well save your life. You're obviously a smart, determined person or else you wouldn't have achieved being a nurse. You can do this easily. You have a big advantage over everyone else. So do it and be the best at it.",

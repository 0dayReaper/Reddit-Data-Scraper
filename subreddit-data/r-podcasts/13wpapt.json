It\u2019s sci-fi horror tho. \n\nSon and his dog are the only crew awake on a space ship but something is not right. Listen with headphones to really appreciate the soundscaping on this one. I was too scared to listen in the dark but you would feel like you are there if you do.",

You can also check r/Audiodrama for other people\u2019s suggestions \n\n- [The Magnus archives](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/) (at this point a classic) starts out as if it was a horror anthology but the stories are actually all connected. If you don\u2019t like the audio quality of the first episodes it improves dramatically in the second season and beyond. There will be a sequel (sort of) later this year. (This has a full cast)\n\n- [Malevolent](https://www.malevolent.ca): A detective, Arthur, in the 1930s wakes up blind but with a strange voice in his head. He tries to find out what happened. This is also a horror podcast and I like the different take on the format. (Because the main character is blind more description than usual in podcasts is totally justified)(this maybe surprising when you listen to it but there is only one voice actor here - the creator Harlan Guthrie. Deviser is also his creation)\n\n- [Re: Dracula](https://redracula.live): podcast version of the book. I like this one more than I thought I would! It has a full cast ( for people who have listened to a bunch of podcasts there are many familiar voices &lt; 3)\n\n- [the Lovecraft investigations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spb8w) (also a classic): a modern adaptation of some Lovecraft stories. It is a bbc production the follows two Podcaster as they investigate some strange cases in the uk and the USA.\n\n- [Edge of Sleep](https://qcodemedia.com/theedgeofsleep): One morning everyone who was asleep, is dead. A few survivors remain and they have to stay awake at all costs. (Sleep deprivation is scary af)",

Each episode is an interview (most of the hosts lines are cut out so it sounds more like a monologue) of someone who you\u2019d likely never talk to or hear about in your day to day life.  It is so well made and the stories often make me think about things in a new way. It also captures the feeling of wonder in a way that is rare in the wide world of podcasts. Wonder is always a feeling that picks me up when I\u2019m in a rut, it might work for you too.",

They're very peaceful and calm interviews with writers in different industries (authors of fiction/non-fiction, journalists, comedians, graphic novelists) about how they approach their work. Often they talk about what they do to maintain focus and how they overcome writer's block etc. I find it useful with respect to my work, but also a lot of the advice can be applied to life more generally. Not to mention it's especially enjoyable when she's interviewing a writer whose work I'm already familiar with.",

But these are great options before sleep-- so your subconscious mind can also partake in a mental break.",

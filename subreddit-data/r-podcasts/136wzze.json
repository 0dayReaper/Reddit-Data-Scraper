    "postText": "With a phone call between a man(Eli, maybe?!) and his best friend from college maybe. She is married with children. The call is usually a joke or a bit and she is super snarky in return. However, that\u2019s just how it opens, almost has nothing to do with the subject matter. It\u2019s also a part of a Podcast Family/consortium, much like Pushkin. \n\nOne episode told the story of how he broke his arm over one summer yet no one in his immediate family can corroborate his story. \n\nThank you in advance.",

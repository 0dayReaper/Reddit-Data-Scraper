                    "comment": "&gt;The official description of the podcast is: \"The official podcast of American entrepreneur Bedros Keuilian. A show that\u2019s unapologetically unfiltered that will make you think, make you laugh and inspire you to become an even better human.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some of the topics I've listened to so far are:\n\n* Taking better care of yourself (confidence-competence loop), and not letting others who always blame everything on others bring you down\n* Financial lessons/habits (he's currently a fitness entrepreneur, and topics of fitness would be ideal as well)\n* In a general sense: taking back control of your life\n\nSo basically, just looking for self-help/inspiration without the lovey-dovey \"you can do this!\" and more towards \"quite being an asshole to yourself\" mentality. Bedros is always talking about \"manning-up\" and I'm curious if there's a \"woman-up\" podcast with the same in your face attitude with a sprinkle of swear words.",

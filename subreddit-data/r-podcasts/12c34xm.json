Plus louis theorux on grounded and a bit cliche but Adam Buxton is also very good, manages to bring out the most sensitive things while keeping it light somehow. \n\nOpposite would be Paul McKenna. Gives no room to guests to go anywhere other than what the format allows.",

There were a bunch of interviews with Brooks then, but Maron\u2019s was better than the others and I\u2019ve listened to him since.\n\nHe does an amazing job of going back to people\u2019s childhoods and then working through the impactful events in their lives. His interview with a person usually ends up being the definitive one and features plenty of humor and insight.\n\nI can see where some people might not like the part of the podcast at the beginning where he babbles about his neuroses and his life. I like that part also, but you always have the option to skip past it to get to the interview.",

It's not just Barbara and Neil that have commended him for his interview skills. Many other guests have as well. The questions he asks show the depth of knowledge he has on his guest, but they are also open ended in a way that the listener doesn't have to know the interviewee to get a lot out of the answer. I'm not explaining it very well, but out of the many podcasts I listen to, I am most frequently impressed by the host as much as the guests when listening to The Diary of a CEO.",

He does a good job of getting to the information of what people want but in general his interviews could be much, much more concise. Especially for people like me who have no science background, getting into the weeds a lot doesn't help to serve the greater argument or thesis they are proving. Often it just muddles the facts and makes them less memorable. I do like him though, don't get me wrong.",

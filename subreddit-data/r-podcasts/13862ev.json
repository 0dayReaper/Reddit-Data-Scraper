On the one hand I'm glad there are so few aviation accidents anymore that they're running out of content, but mostly I'm bummed because this  is one of my favourites.  It's well-researched, Gus is a great presenter, and Chris' \"oh no!\"s are very cute.  Any other Black Box Heads out there with recommendations for pods with similar vibes?",

            "comment": "This is such a bumming update. I\u2019ve been looking for more historical disaster/event driven information podcast presented in an understandable/humorous way since I discovered BBD. Here\u2019s one I found so far:\n\nDoomsday: history\u2019s most dangerous podcast is kinda similar it\u2019s a solo hosted podcast and it\u2019s a presented in a funny way (ex: he often compared the size/weight of things to it\u2019s equivalent in dodge caravans) but says it in a very neutral/presentation-like voice which I think is very funny. It comes off as less serious but it\u2019s just the way it\u2019s presented and is very much fact based. \n\nAlarmist is good too but is kinda divided into an informative section and a discussion section where she discusses \u201cwho is to blame\u201d for said tragedies/accidents with her special guest(s) each episode. I do recommend it though very funny. \n\nBuried bones (where one of the cohosts is *the* Paul Holes). It\u2019s hosted by a journalist who specializes research in old centuries old criminal cases and with Paul holes (retired investigator) they look at the cases through a 21st century lens. Very interesting, Paul holes is a gem, not a comedy podcast but the cohosts do have very good chemistry and is very enjoyable.",

It was always interesting and \"chris reacts to X\" has become a running joke between me and my daughter. \n\nSimilar level of detail about accidents/disasters is the Brady Heywood podcast. Solo host though. He looks at engineering failures/catastrophes and the human reasons for them. It sounds dry but is llow key suspenseful at times and is really interesting.\n\nShip Hits the Fan would be the other Rooster Teeth pod that I'd think of. I actually liked Ship Hits the Fan more than Black Box Down up until Brian left and now it doesn't work quite as well. At any rate heavier on the humor but also well-researched and it looks at maritime disasters.",

It was wonderful and led me to go check out every book about space program catastrophes at the library. Thrilled to see someone else with my oddly niche tastes but sad I couldn't offer you anything you didn't already listen to :(  \n\nThe Secret History of the Estonia might be up your alley if you haven't tried it yet. I found it pretty compelling. Same with The Big One and White Silence.",

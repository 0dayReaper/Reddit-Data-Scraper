She and her husband had a big impact there back in the day.  That scene used to have a general problem with sexual abusers back in the 70s-80s by all accounts.",

Ive listened to a few episodes of S.J. but my ears can't handle much of  the one host's voice ( I forget his name). I will look it up the episode tho, thanks for mentioning.",

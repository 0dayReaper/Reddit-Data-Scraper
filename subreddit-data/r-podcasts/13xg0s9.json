I\u2019m looking for a podcast similar to: How to Take Over the World, where each episode goes over the biography of a person and what they did.",

Hopefully you don\u2019t already know of him.\n\nDollop\u2019s series on Billy Martin\n\nI listen to several comedy podcasts (Last Podcast on the Left; Behind the Bastards) but they\u2019re acquired tastes.\n\nAnd a lot of cult podcasts which take a dark turn of course but count as genuises/remarkable in what they are able to accomplish. I recommend Sunshine Place, a fantastic podcast about Synanon and in depth character study of its founder.",

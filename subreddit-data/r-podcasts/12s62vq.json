They have multiple seasons with different topics. I recently listened to S39 Waco and S46 The Midnight Crew. Deep dives into the big stories you might know a little about.\n\n**Wild Thing** is a skeptic looking into Bigfoot. This normally wouldn't be my kind of thing but I found it so interesting. \n\nQuickfire:   \n\\+ **Immaculate Deception** (fertility doctor who used his own sperm)  \n\\+ **Trojan Horse Affair** (A mysterious letter detailing a supposed Islamist plot to take over schools shocked Britain in 2014. But who wrote it? From Serial Productions)  \n\\+ **Sold A Story** (Shorter but very interesting on how children learn to read and why one method of teaching has left a lot of kids illiterate and how covid helped parents realise it)",

            "comment": "[The Assassination](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05r6cgx) from BBC World Service is probably my favourite of this genre - investigates the assassination of former Pakistani PM, Benazir Bhutto. The reporter can be considered partisan - but he is fairly upfront about this, and it doesn't detract from the investigation IMO.\n\n[Lazarus Heist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtvg9/episodes/downloads) investigates hacking/cyberfraud incidents allegedly committed by the North Korean state funded hackers. The first season was around the Bangladesh Bank heist, the current (in-progress) looks at ATM jacking attacks in India and Malta. \n\n[I'm Not A Monster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08yblkf/episodes/downloads) - each season dives deep into the story of a western woman who joined ISIS. The second season, centered on Shamima Begum, just finished a couple weeks ago. A word of warning, the host does a very good job of being neutral IMO; but if you feel very strongly that \"they made their beds, let them rot in hell forever\", you might find him \"too sympathetic to monsters\". \n\n[The Women's War](https://www.thewomenswar.com/) - a documentary about Kurdish women fighting the Islamic State in Syria, and attempting a feminist revolution. The organization featured is not without controversy (nothing is black and white in a war zone) and the host of this podcast is pretty open about his admiration for these women, so it can be viewed as partisan. But again, IMO, he does a great job.\n\n[Blowback](https://blowback.show/) - Each season dives deep into one of America's many foreign wars. The hosts are unabashedly leftist and against American imperialism - and this is *definitely* a partisan podcast. YMMV - but it's definitely worth listening to, IMO. But keep your critical thinking on (which you should do for all podcasts)\n\n[Conflicted](https://www.deezer.com/en/show/358112?deferredFl=1) - An ex-Al Qaeda jihadi turned MI6 spy deep dives into one conflict in \"the middle east\" per season. More or less. He absolutely is partisan (leans the opposite way to the Blowback guys IMO) and an interested party in these conflicts, but well worth listening to",

The Stalker series was really engrossing. It is not your typical true crime. I won't tell you more because I don't want to spoil it. Not all have 9 eps per subject, but that one does, and another recent interesting one was the true story of Frank Abagnale (of Catch Me if You Can fame).",

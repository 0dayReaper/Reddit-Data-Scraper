If I pause for too long or if I don't have them queued I'll have to wait til I can reconnect to play again. The desktop app is awful for podcasts too, you can sort them alphabetically or by date followed, but not by new episodes. One thing I do like about the desktop version is the ability to sort episodes by length, but can't do that on my phone. I've been signed up so long I kind of didn't give it much thought, but this Rogan thing has pissed me off enough to realise it's probably not a service it makes sense to pay for since I listen to far more podcasts than music, I'll probably switch to earwolf or something and drop back to the free version of spotify",

If a podcast I enjoy goes to ONLY Spotify, I'll simply drop them from my list and move on.  \n\nTo my knowledge, Spotify can only require exclusivity to the podcasts that agree to those terms. You're blaming the service, but ignoring the fact that the content creators that agree to $potify's terms are the reason it's happening.   \n\nShort take: Spotify isn't making content exclusive, content creators are willing to sell their souls to Spotify for exclusivity. Blame who you will, but keep some perspective.",

Apple's, believe it or not, is open. You can listen to any podcast so long as it's published via rss. Most you've heard of are open, and your choice comes down to player preference.

But a big reason why it\u2019s a lot of \u201clegacy artists\u201d is because their pre-streaming contracts basically ensured that they make next to nothing from streaming anyway. And not the normal next to nothing that I make from streaming as an independent artist, but a tiny percentage of that nearly nothing, *if* they\u2019re receiving any money at all. A lot of legacy artists end up owing their label so much (due to extremely predatory industry standards) that they never see a dime of streaming revenues.\n\nSo in some ways what\u2019s happening with Spotify has turned over more than one rock on the disfunction of the music industry as a whole. I hope it keeps up because the more grievances aired the better afaic. It\u2019s a shit industry to its core.",

He has both left wing people on and right wing people on so he is demonized for being non partisan. He seems kind of middle of tbe road but he isn't preaching crazy shit. It's just open dialogue. \n\n\nOlder clips on youtube are interesting. Stuff about UFOs, psychedelics, ancient world stuff, physics. There is a good clip of Rogan explaining systematic racism to Ben Shaprio. I am not some super fan of his, I just like hearing interesting interviews and hate when mass hysteria goes after people for the wrong thing. \n\nI think it's easy for the media to paint him as the enemy because he isn't beholden to any side, and that is dangerous to them. That's how I see it anyway. You're either all in or not. And I hate that line of thinking. I consider myself liberal and am open minded enough to listen to interesting stuff and not cast everyone who doesnt think 100% like me aside .",

Why doesn't CNN refuse to air another episode of any show on any cable provider that carries Fox News? It would be a real sign of protest, imagine that. Talk about newsworthy. \n\n\nPS If the human race dies off from a virus because of a fringey doctor on a podcast, I say good riddance. You reap what you sow.

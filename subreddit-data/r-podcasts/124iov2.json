(kind of in the vein of the podcast just king things, where the hosts analyze and discuss king books in publication order)\n\nother media analysis podcasts also welcome, i really enjoy those",

He has a wide ranging back catalogue and will often discuss them in connection to other films to help push you towards where to go next. His podcasts are essentially small essays and are also just a fantastic way to get used to that style of language which will help in your studies.\n\nObviously everyone else has some great recs too, I particularly love Faculty of Horror, Projection Booth and Rewatchables, but just going a bit more towards that film studies side there is also:\n\nThe Next Picture Show: Probably my favourite for reviews, it looks at a new movie and discusses it with an older classic film.\n\nListen to Lillian: A film podcast looking at gender in mostly British cinema. \n\nPure Cinema Podcast: Probably the best for recommendations, especially deep cuts as the hosts are kind of a walking enclopedia of B movies. Also has some very fun episodes with established directors like Taratino and Edgar Wright.\n\n90 minutes or Less Filmfest: as it says! They have surprisingly really good guests come on and discuss a film under 90 mins.\n\nDrive-In Garage/Flashback/Easy Riders Ragong Podcast - all really great easy listening review shows on a single movie. \n\nThe Cinematologists: Maybe a bit more of a deep cut but they have very good interviews with filmmakers critics etc on a variety of topics and films. Similarly The cinephilliacs is very good and involves an interview and then discussion about a particular film.\n\nIf you want to get into more films and you're just not sure where to start there's a lot of podcasts out there that follow lists ala AFI top 100 or go through blu ray publishers like Criterion which can be really helpful for sticking to the classics while also going outside just English speaking stuff.\n\nHope you enjoy your studies!",

Speaking for myself and other neuroscientists I've had conversations with about his podcast and ethos, his advice reflects a weird ass puritanical view of mental health that is not at all based in published evidence. And very often when it *seems* like it is, or he cites a study, if you go and read the literature, it does not claim what he says whatsoever.\n\nIf you throw in that he's selling extremely overpriced and also not-very-scientific \"nutritional supplements\" in some weird Alex Jones type fashion, claiming they'll boost (insert thing), I mean, shit. I get that he's got a pretty sizable lab at Stanford, and he must have some pretty good postdocs over there running it, but the dude himself has sort of gone off the rails.\n\nLike, take a drink every time you see or hear the word \"optimize\" on his website or podcast. That is not how brains or bodies work. \"SOLVING BIPOLAR DISORDER\"? No, just...no. That is not how this works.",

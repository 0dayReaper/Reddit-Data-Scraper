    "postText": "Not sure if there is a better way to ask for a select group of listeners, but I'm looking for recommendations for true horror/solved crime podcasts that are focused in South Asia. I'm currently listening to Desi Crime Podcast and Prethkotha (Bangla), both of which I am really enjoying and look forward to listening to their episodes as soon as they come out. I'm open to English, Hindi, and Bangla podcasts but I would prefer the narration in Hindi/Bangla for that authentic touch. Does anyone have any favorites within the aforementioned genres?",

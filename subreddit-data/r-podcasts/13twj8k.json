TIG AND CHERYL: TRUE STORY popped up on my recommendation feed and I liked past stuff with TIG not a dogged fan but enjoy her conversational style. But I know nothing about the other woman aside from her acting work. \nDo they have a good dynamic? \nI\u2019m willing to give it a listen but I wanted to field some opinions from this subreddit first. \nIn advance, thanks",

            "comment": "I love listening to this pod - here the main thing though: you need to be able to give up any expectation you're going to hear about the documentary they're covering. It's kind of a running joke on the pod. It's mostly going to be digressions on some thing that happened in it reminding them of a story from their lives, or Tig kidding Cheryl about something she just said. Their conversational style is very entertaining. It is much more like listening to two friends catch up once a week and share funny stories about things they went through when they were both starting out in the entertainment industry.  And those are usually interesting and/or very funny. \n\nYou know Tig's style. Cheryl is very lighthearted and giggly, not at like the characters I've seen her play. It's a well-balanced contrast, in that way. They're both very endearing, just in different ways.\n\nIf you are going to be irritated that they're not sticking to covering what happened in the doc very well, then it will be a frustrating listening for you. If you're up for following a conversational river between two funny friends and just enjoying the experience of where it may bounce around, then its is a fun one to check in on.",

As the other commenter said, if you\u2019re looking for a podcast that\u2019ll actually tell you about the documentary in detail then this one is probably not for you. But I listen to this not caring about what the documentary is (although you will usually get the gist) cause these two\u2019s stories are just so funny. If you decide to listen I highly recommend starting from the beginning as there are a lot of running jokes. \n\nAs for not being very familiar with Cheryl, I\u2019d say all you need to know is she played Larry David\u2019s wife in Curb Your Enthusiasm. All other stories she tells she gives context for cause she knows she\u2019s not a super well known personality. Also Cheryl was a guest on Tig\u2019s other podcast, Don\u2019t Ask Tig, which was a very funny episode too so you might want to listen to that to get a taste of their dynamic.\n\nTo conclude, yes I would highly recommend this podcast to anyone as this is probably the one I\u2019m laughing out loud the most and constantly re-listening to. Hope you enjoy it!",

                            "comment": "My other two tops are Sibling Rivalry and Gilmore Guys. They aren\u2019t really similar to Tig and Cheryl so they might not be for you but I\u2019ll tell you a bit about them. \n\nSibling Rivalry is Bob the Drag Queen and Mon\u00e9t X Change\u2019s podcast; they are both drag queens and comedians who competed on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race so they reference that show a lot. If you aren\u2019t a fan of the show you might feel left out sometimes but the podcast is not about Drag Race. They pick a topic to talk about each episode (e.g. jobs, education, weddings, etc) and then basically they argue because they\u2019re both very opinionated. In my opinion they\u2019re hilarious, but I\u2019ve heard some people say they find the constant arguing uncomfortable despite it all being between friends and exaggerated for comedic effect.\n\nGilmore Guys is a Gilmore Girls rewatch podcast where two men, Kevin and Demi, who didn\u2019t know each other very well to begin with bond over watching Gilmore Girls. Kevin is a long time fan of the show and guides Demi through his first time watching it. Obviously with this one if you don\u2019t like Gilmore Girls or aren\u2019t interested in watching it for the first this one won\u2019t appeal, but if you do like GG or want to try it for the first time then these two have excellent chemistry and have a lot of great guests. Some say they take a while to find their style and the podcast definitely improves as it goes on but I enjoy the early episodes too. Also be warned the episodes get really long towards the end but that didn\u2019t bother me cause I couldn\u2019t get enough of these two.\n\nAs a bonus in case you\u2019re not interested in the other two: \nBest Friends with Nicole Byer and Sasheer Zamata. Similar funny friendly conversation to Tig and Cheryl and also Sibling Rivalry, but more inclusive because they\u2019re not heavy on references to a show you might not have seen. They tell funny personal stories, give advice to their listeners, and take quizzes.\n\nAnd obviously try Don\u2019t Ask Tig if you haven\u2019t already! Sorry if none of these interest you. I know they\u2019re quite particular.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m a lost 20 something having a hard time balancing entering the real world. An example of what my 20 something looks like, working full time on 3rd shifts, getting ready to look at grad school, being broke, having trouble lining up schedules with friends/family, and spending a lot of time contemplating the uncertainty of the future, so fun! Anyways, was wondering if anyone has some good podcast recommendations for people in their 20\u2019s trying to figure life out?",

For anyone in their 20s (or any age really) thinking about parenthood and wondering whether or not they want kids, The Longest Shortest Time is a pod that ended a few years ago but is still on Spotify and has truly invaluable content.",

You only think you're having fun when using them...its not genuine fun, which you dont figure out until later.",

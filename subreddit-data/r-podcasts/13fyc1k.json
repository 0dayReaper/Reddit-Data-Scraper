    "postText": "Me and my sister love listening to podcasts in the car. Unfortunately, our taste in podcasts leans very adult, and she has 2 boys (6 and 10). We can't listen to our podcasts when they're in the car with us. The comedy ones are too raunchy, and the scary ones are too scary. \n\nWe've tried listening to some podcasts made with kids in mind, but they almost always have this over-the-top voicework that annoys us AND the boys. That, or they're boring for us all. \n\nWhat are some that we might all enjoy? Me and my sister listen to Beach too sandy, water too wet, And that's why we drink, Dead meat, and sometimes Crime junkies. I also listen to Distractible and a bit of MBMBAM. We're leaning more towards funny stuff, as we're getting burnt out on horror and true crime anyway. Thanks!",

It\u2019s easy listening but engaging and super fun to learn random sometimes useful information and a lot of their listeners are travelers or travelers with kids on road trips",

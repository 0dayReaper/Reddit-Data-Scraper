    "postText": "Basically looking for podcasts about cultural diplomacy or cultural propaganda, in which pop culture affects world history in some way. This could be government-engineered pop culture (like the CIA-written song \u201cWind of Change\u201d) or pop culture that\u2019s coincidentally used as an opportunity for political gains, if that makes sense.\n\nBUT, in general, any podcast that looks at world history through the lens of art/culture would be awesome. Thanks!",

I'm not even heavily into visual arts but had some interesting drama/con stories interwoven with explaining what you mention - intersection of art/culture, explaining a little piece of history you probably didn't know about.",

It delves into the intersection of art and culture, and even if you're not heavily into visual arts, it presents some intriguing drama and con stories. Plus, it uncovers fascinating pieces of history that you probably didn't know about. Overall, it's a great example of how pop culture can affect world history in unexpected ways.",

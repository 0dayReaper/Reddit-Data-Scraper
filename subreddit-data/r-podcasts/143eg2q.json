    "postText": "Hey crew, I've been itching to listen to some good, educational or deep dive investigative journalism, but I'm not really into murder docs or US History (I'm Canadian!).\n\nI did like Nice White Parents, ReplyAll's super tech support and investigations, a lot of Gimlet's stuff, pretty much anything by 99% invisible, and many of CBC's IDeas/Quirks &amp; Quarks. I also admit Darknet Diaries is a guilty pleasure. The only types of crime shows I'm really interested in are larger scale social or mystery, or quirky crimes / oddities, not murder or serial killers or dark stories of victims.\n\nWhats your favourite series recently? Anything like these that you'd recommend?  \n\n\nEDIT: Y'all are amazing, I'm thrilled to fill my work playlist with all these great recs. ",

This podcast won a couple of awards. \n\nFrom the site: \u201cThe Outlaw Ocean Podcast is a seven-part series that explores a gritty and lawless realm rarely seen, populated by traffickers and smugglers, pirates and mercenaries, wreck thieves and repo men, vigilante conservationists and elusive poachers, seabound abortion providers, clandestine oil dumpers, shackled slaves and cast-adrift stowaways. Relying on more than eight years of reporting on all seven oceans and in more than three dozen countries, the podcast brings all of The Outlaw Ocean Project's journalism together as an immersive podcast series.\n\nThere are few remaining frontiers on our planet. Perhaps the wildest, and least understood, are the world\u2019s oceans. Too big to police, and under no clear international authority, these immense regions of treacherous water play host to rampant criminality and exploitation.\u201d\n\n [https://www.theoutlawocean.com/the-outlaw-ocean-podcast/](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/the-outlaw-ocean-podcast/)",

What she did etc. \n\nChameleon: Hollywood con queen - about a long running fraud in the movie business \n\nWind of change - an investigative journalism series about if the rock song Wind of Change helped end the Cold War and how CIA used music and pop culture to influence to fight communism \n\nDolly Parton\u2019s America is a doc series about Dolly Parton, Americana. The country music scene globally. It covers sooo much and it\u2019s just glorious. Plus it\u2019s got Dolly Parton in it \n\nOkay.

After two years and thousands of hours of investigative work, police believe they are close to solving the mystery of what happened to her. We go inside the investigation, tracking down leads and joining search parties through the dense mountains of the Flathead Reservation. As we unravel this mystery, the show examines what it means to be an Indigenous woman in America.\n\nhttps://gimletmedia.com/shows/stolen\n\n**Kuper Island:** An 8-part series that tells the stories of four students: three who survived and one who didn\u2019t.

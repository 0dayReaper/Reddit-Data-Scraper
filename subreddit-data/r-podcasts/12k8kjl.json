    "postText": "Hi all,  \nApologies for the spammy post, but I'm looking for help finding a particular podcast episode. In my head, it's from something along the lines of a Radiolab or This American Life, one of the big general interest podcasts that had their heyday in the 2010s.  \n\n\nIt dealt with a young man who had had suicidal ideation throughout his life, even as a young child. It dealt with his attempts to manage his impulses as he grew older and his seeming recovery until, as a young adult, he did take his life, the implication being that he had been hiding the fact that his urges had remained with him even as he portrayed a certain facade of recovery to his loved ones. Sounds bleak, and in my memory it certainly was, but was also very thoughtful and beautiful.  \n\n\nDoes anyone know what I'm talking about?",

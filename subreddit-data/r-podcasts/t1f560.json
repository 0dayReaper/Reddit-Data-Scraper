Apply the \u201cany benefit\u201d theory of social media (from the book deep work). We too often stay on Facebook, etc because it might give a minor benefit, and we wind up keeping things in our life with out considering if they really serve us. Instead think about what\u2019s most important to you in life (relaxing and humor for example, this doesn\u2019t just apply to learning) and then if each podcast adds a significant net positive to one of those goals. For me many were neutral at best, where I\u2019d listen for hours (at high speed because I had so many) because maybe I\u2019d learn something useful.

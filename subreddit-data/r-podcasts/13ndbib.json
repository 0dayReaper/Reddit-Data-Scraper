I am not interested in a podcast that is mostly friends joking around/relies on the speaker's personality and banter.  No shame to anyone who enjoys that vibe. I just want something that covers interesting material without feeling like I have to get through six in-jokes before the facts are presented.\n\nEdited to add: thank you all so much! I cant wait to start working down the list. I sincerely love how many niche podcasts there are",

Usually espides are historical deep dives on a single ingerdient, dish, or cuisine through history. Hosts are friendly and occasionally tell jokes, but the entire thing is very scripted with no banter at all.",

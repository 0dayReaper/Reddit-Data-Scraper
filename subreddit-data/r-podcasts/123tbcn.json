    "postText": "There was recently another episode in the Tim Ferriss Show with Naval Ravikant, and in the introduction Tim mentions how Naval's first appearance was nominated as \"Podcast of the Year\". I've heard him say it before, so I got curious to know what this \"Podcast of the Year\" thing is, but I haven't been able to find what he's referring to.\n\nI'm aware there are many outlets doing their lists of favourite podcasts, but which one in particular is Tim talking about? Doing some searches I've found things like The Ambies and The Golden Mics, but none of those existed in 2015 so I'm curious which one it is (and which podcast won instead of Tim's :D).",

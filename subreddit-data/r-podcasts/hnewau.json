    "postText": "**Are podcasts about to be ruined?**\n\nThe world of podcasts has had an avalanche of headlines recently, when some famous names signed exclusive deals with Spotify \u2014 meaning that some podcasts might soon be available *only* on Spotify. As a long-time binge listener and podcast enthusiast, I am truly worried that the experience of podcasts \u2014 a ritual many like me look forward to everyday \u2014 is about to get terrible. This is the point of view this news inspired me, touching on the subject of podcasts and more.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the first time I downloaded a podcast, but it would have been around 15 years ago. I remember the device I was using: a 2nd generation iPod. At the time the podcast had to be downloaded to the computer and synched on the iPod, a process I was happy to perform and that was considered relatively seamless for the standard of the time (when iTunes was still good, but that\u2019s another story\u2026).\n\nWikipedia, podcasts and Google Earth are probably the three uses of the Internet that have broadened my horizons the most in these formative years of my life, and set my expectations of the Internet. Each was providing a virtually infinite amount of content for free. And, if this trio sounds boring to you, take a second to realise what a sudden unlimited access to millions of free encyclopedia entries and millions of square kilometres of satellite pictures of the Earth must have done to our brains. Not everyone will agree, but in my experience it has been a paradigm shift on a nearly-Copernican scale: one could \u201ctravel\u201d everywhere and \u201cknow\u201d everything (well, *almost*).\n\nHowever, while Wikipedia has mostly stayed the same (and by the way, don\u2019t forget that Wikipedia needs [donations](https://donate.wikimedia.org/) to continue to exist), Google Earth hasn\u2019t. That is, Google Earth still exists, but Google Maps took over its appeal \u2014 while becoming more useful \u2014 and then compromised it, by making it a place where businesses pay to be seen, just like on the company\u2019s search engine. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Google Maps, and use it \u2014 massively \u2014 to discover and remember places, but with all these labels and tags that pop up at every level of zoom it doesn\u2019t capture the imagination of a wandering mind in the same way that it used to. It makes the satellite images pointless, more tiring to the eyes in comparison to the maps, and harder to find in them the beauty they once had in Google Earth.\n\nTo the trio I cited above, I *could* add the combo Pirate Bay + Bittorrent. But it\u2019s easy to see why I haven\u2019t. Yes, peer-to-peer file sharing was about infinite access to any song or film, but artists and creators weren\u2019t getting their cut, and for this reason it was obviously not a \u201cdesirable\u201d model in the long term. I remember specifically wishing for a service that would give \u2014 legally, and for a reasonable price \u2014 the same access to music, instead of the ridiculous one song = one dollar price tag that iTunes or Amazon were asking. And I wasn\u2019t alone thinking that would be great, many companies came up with such a proposition, until finally it was Spotify that took the largest piece of the cake that music streaming has become.\n\nAnd \u2014 although I don\u2019t know enough to know if Spotify pays artists fairly \u2014 as a user, what they are providing is mostly what I had been hoping for. Which is why I have been happily paying for a premium membership for years. And, while I was fine with the Spotify app being a podcast player as well, that\u2019s not what I was using it for (it sucks at it), so I hadn\u2019t given it much thought until now. Their entrance into the world of podcasts has me very worried about the future of this media.\n\nNow, I wish content could be independent from the platform. Podcasts are great for many reasons, some already mentioned above: they are free to listen, with a wide range of quality of content, but also, they are *platform neutral*. A user can choose any app they like for their podcasts, and still have access to *all* the podcasts. What Spotify has been doing in the past few months has been to announce [\u201cexclusive\u201d](https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-14-spotify-podcast-exclusives-riggles-picks-rob-riggle-sarah-tiana.html?guccounter=1) partnerships, to have podcasts that will only be available on their platform. And I have no words to express how much I despise them for going down this road. It is incredibly frustrating that a single company can do such a thing to millions of listeners who were not asking for it (I have yet to find a single person excited about \u201cSpotify exclusive\u201d podcasts).\n\nFrom a user perspective, platform neutrality is a great model. Just think about how much it sucks already that there are multiple video streaming platforms, competing with their exclusive contents: if you have Netflix but a show you want to see is not on it, you\u2019ll have to cancel your subscription and start one with the other platform, or cumulate both. And if you keep both, you don\u2019t \u201cmagically\u201d have twice as much time to watch twice as much content, you are just paying more and getting less value, which seems to defeat the purpose of streaming, whose appeal was \u2014 from a user perspective \u2014 to remove the necessity to deal with multiple platforms and multiple costs. Unfortunately for podcasts, after having resisted for so long, that might be the direction they are heading into.\n\nIf streaming services continue to become so fragmented, downloading things illegally will become attractive again. I suppose piracy is the best protest tool users have to show these companies they are not happy with their business models, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if illegal downloading gets reborn in some new streaming-age and mobile-friendly form.\n\nFinally, I will acknowledge that podcasts do need a better economic model than the current one. Over the years, the amount of ads has increased to the point that it has become painful to listen to some of them. But all hope is not lost, smarter ways to reward content creators are emerging, for the web for instance: my favourite one is Brave browser \u2014 with the Basic Attention Token \u2014 which helps users to have control over which websites they want to support, either by choosing an ad-free experience and dedicating to them any budget they chose, or by paying them with money they earn from allowing adverts while browsing. A similar principle could be applied to podcasts: what if there was a platform-neutral alternative way to support podcasts proportionally to how much time we spend listening to them? What if this was applied to more than just podcasts but also music and films? I wish content could be independent from the platform.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLink to my [article](https://medium.com/@thomasradwanski/are-podcasts-about-to-be-ruined-2452a9036f88) (Medium).

With that said though, there is something about mixing music with podcasts that sounds really intriguing to me. I love podcasts about music history and really just music in general. I think it would be absolutely fantastic if podcast creators could create a podcast that is built like a playlist where they would have the podcast broken up into pieces with the relevant songs spliced in without the having to worry about copyright issues. As it stands now most music podcasts can only play short clips of a song that qualifies under fair use. I\u2019d absolutely listen the shit out of a podcast that could do an episode deep dive into a beetles or bob dylan song and play the whole thing while explaining context and background and relevant anecdotes.",

The library and home pages work well with artists, but the lack of a separate podcast library is silly. If they had an option to enable a fourth tab at the bottom that displayed all my podcasts, it'd be much more usable. Searching from that page should let you search podcasts only, so you don't have to scroll past the music results to see them. \n\nAlso, maybe this is personal preference, but I hate how large each episode is on a pods home page. For pods like SYSK, the Dollop, or any news podcasts, you have to scroll a while to find what you want. If i only listened to a few pods, I wouldn't mind Spotify and would probably use it and delete podbean. But I like to listen to them pretty constantly, and finding what I want on Spotify is so clunky for podcasts that its impractical.",

How can Spotify afford to pay Joe Rogan Millions for an exlcusive deal and still have such a garbage player. \n\nNo sleep timer, no way to sort downloaded epsiodes without making a playlist. Then when you do make a playlist it automatically makes it a music playlist.\n\nThe only thing Spotify does better than Stitcher is its trending list. I like being able to see the top 100 with indicators as to how podcasts are moving around. Makes me proud to see niche podcasts ive listened to forever make top 50 or top 20.",

It's an industry that hasn't historically had a lot of money in it, but with multiple big services competing, we're gonna see a lot more money flowing into it, which will create some fantastic quality shows.\n\nBuuut that might be at the expense of making it worse for independent creators as they start to get pushed out by the big productions. But then, isn't that kind of already happening? We let Serial and Night Vale etc set our ideas of how successful podcasts can be, but the fact is, most podcasts are still getting maybe a couple hundred listeners on a good month.\n\nI guess in terms of whether I'm for or against this move to exclusives, I have to ask myself: if Spotify came to me and offered me a big check to make Quietly Yours a Spotify exclusive, would I take the deal?\n\nThe answer is I wouldn't. But that's partly because the show already exists, and people expect to find it on their app of choice, and I've explicitly promise on-air that the show will always be free, a pledge I plan to always respect.\n\nI'm working on another show right now that hasn't yet launched, so would I take the deal if Spotify offered to buy that? Possibly. It would give us the resources to make the show the best it can be, it would help out my own career and therefore help out Quietly Yours indirectly, too.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is I can see both sides of the argument for why this is or isn't a good thing.\n\nI think the main takeaway is that it's important to support independent podcast creators, whether directly through Patreon etc, or by sharing and helping them to grow.",

Judging by their listener numbers, they're probably making at least  $10,000,000 a year from just one ad spot an episode. That's far from how it is for most podcasts.\n\nI mean, statistically, my show gets more listeners than 80% of podcasts. But it still doesn't make money. Most people in this industry are fuelled only on passion and losing money trying to put out quality shows for nothing material in return.\n\nSo I guess my point is you can't blame someone for shoving an extra ad or two into their show. I get why it's annoying as a listener, but if you're yet to break even and a second ad spot is the difference between losing money and breaking even, you can't begrudge them too much.\n\nAlthough I do think steps should always be taken to minimize how disruptive and unpleasant ads can be, of course.",

I hope you make money on it someday as well. I have tried out so many popular podcasts and find myself noping out real quick because of their production and corporate feel.\n\n\nBroken Justice for example.  Every 22-25 minute episode has maybe 5 minutes(maybe exaggerated)of new info because they treat it like a network TV show, a lot of commercials with a recap upon every return and a lot of \"experts\" repeating the same thing. If you listen to Broken Justice you will see why I fear podcasts going in that direction.",

That sounds sour but it's not at all, I love making content that is available to everyone to listen to. I just wish that those financially able to pay for content that they enjoy actually did so more often. Because if that culture doesn't change, then yes, corporations are going to come in and pour dirt in our mouths. I would take a deal right now if it meant that I could pay my actors what they deserve, cover production costs and bring in help on the production side of things to make my show even better. I'd hate it, but I'd do it in a second if it meant no longer having to stretch the $100 a month that our most dedicated (and awesome) listeners are funding the show with currently.\n\nThe money has to come from somewhere.",

At the moment it's not really suitable for podcasts because it doesn't have compatible players, but I would personally love to see podcast player apps that use it too in the future. \n\nThe way it works is that the user can chose to allow ads in their browser, and get paid a small revenue each month for the ads that were displayed to them, which they can then redistribute back to the pages they visited or wish to contribute to on a monthly basis. It's not completely unlike the way advertising works today, except that it gives control to the user about where their advertising money goes, and it's anonymous.",

As long as it's distributed by the community, with the current climate, even 'free money' takes a lot to drum up. People just don't think about supporting 'free content'. Twitch is a great example. With everything the platform has done to normalize and incentivize donations and subscriptions, streamers have to regularly panhandle for Twitch Prime because folks forget about it... and at least Americans can watch ads for bits last time I checked, to give to their fav streamers so you'd imagine there would be a constant stream of bits coming in... but there isn't. I'm absolutely not saying your proposed solution isn't a good thing. I'm certain many responsible listeners would try to utilize it. I think though for it to actually work for the creators said tokens would have to be towards the listening time spent on each show and be automatically applied for the amount of time listeners spend on your show. It's the only way I can think of to have such a system and ethically deal with what would inevitably become millions of dollars in unclaimed token cash outs.\n\nIt's a tough fight. Giving art out so that everyone can enjoy it is my bag (and most podcasters would agree that they want ears on their stuff) but in doing so, you're essentially 'devaluing' your art to the role of 'free stuff'.\n\nLet's also not forget that anything that relies on ads, no matter how accessible/convienent the compensation for user and listener is.... also is subject to demonetization tactics that Youtube likes to abuse it's content creators with regularly.",

How many listeners will follow a podcast exclusively behind a paywall or to another service with all the other options that are out there is the real question.

Realistically, very few people are going to have money or desire to pay for two, three, four subscription services. And there's the issue of podcasts moving from free to paid models, suddenly cutting off lots of listeners, many who made them popular enough to get there. I can get it if it's an original, but that's not usually the case. And I'm an American abroad. Some podcasts I love have gone to US exclusive services with no EU or Latin American option, so I can't pay even if I want to. Spooked, for example, is on Luminary, which is geoblocked for me. I wouldn't want to pay for a monthly service to get a seasonal podcast that was free, but even if I sucked it up, too bad. There's a reason why music services like Tidal flopped and many paid pod services will probably do the same, with the danger being exclusive shows will go down with them.",

It somehow assumes that these \"Exclusive\" podcasts will be absolutely awesome and with a need-to-listen-as-if-your-life-dependet-on-it quality to it. Nah, sorry. Don't think so. It's one more podcast. One which I might not be able to listen to. Do I like that? Probably not. Is it really that important? Probably also not. If one of my favorite podcasts would move exclusively to a new platform I'd have to sign up for, I'll be sorry to see them go, but I'm not going to sign up. No podcast is that indispensable to be honest. The podcast world is vast and wide and I don't need to have free excess to every single one. Same as I can't read every single great journalistic magazin in the world or have free access to every single book in the world. \n\nPoint is, I don't think people should get that worked up about \"Exclusive content\" and also realize that they have some power over how this industry may go. If you are pissed about your favorite podcast moving to one plattform exclusively make the sacrifice and stop listening to that podcast. Listener numbers are important and if they are going down, that will be noticed.",

At most the network is going to make its own app with only its shows on it, as for the others - as you put it - I'll probably just forget about them rather than subscribe to yet another service (I am a Spotify subscriber, and happy to pay for it but it's enough for me that it does only music).

As you pointed out, the alternatives to a convincing profitable system are sparse. However, I\u2018m pretty convinced that if consumers are not on board (so don\u2018t listen to exclusive content, seek out alternative, open platform podcasts instead) another system might have a chance to take over instead. But for that, obviously, a lot of people have to give podcasts going exclusive the finger. \n\nAs for discovering new stuff...recently I\u2018ve got most of my good finds from this sub or follow up on recommendations from podcasts I listen to.

I personally wouldn\u2019t oppose it but I\u2019d want to remain in control of having my website be fully mine and my show with full creative ownership.\n\nEverything is a subscription these days sadly as people see the $5 price tag a month you multiply that by a million that\u2019s 5 million. I\u2019m sure you could charge the podcaster for premium promotion for $5 a month extra and now it\u2019s $10 million a month just off a million subscribers and podcasters on board. Crazy....",

I've heard some ad that mentioned podcasters can earn up to 5x times as much by going exclusive or to a paid subscription. I think they deserve it. It's not about just loving podcasts while I'm sure we all do some of those podcasters have kids and bills. They deserve to make as much as other artists.",

Stitcher forces downloads even if I select no downloads, Apple is just the worst, Podcast Addict was unintuitive when I first used it but its been a while since I've tried that one they may have changed. Whats the good one if Spotify is the bad one?",

This subscription game has become pure extortion of the consumer for these big media companies. In return this move is going to promote illegal downloads and a piracy of everything. The goal should be increasing your audience by more reach and not extorting them to listen to your few words of wisdom. Not everyone can afford a subscription fee to every single media app on the market. In the end you have to make a choice between sticking to the most used app and use pirate sites for some exclusive content from the other. Some times good old cable companies provide more value for money than multiple subscription.",

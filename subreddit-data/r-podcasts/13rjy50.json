    "postText": "I know podcasts and content creators want to make money with their content: totally fair and understood. I would too if I hosted a podcast. \n\nBut as a listener, I always find myself hitting the 30-second skip button (since most podcast ads are 30 seconds, sometimes 60 seconds). Especially if the same podcast has the same ads. \n\nIt got me thinking: are podcasters actually benefitting from this? If a lot of people are hitting that 30-second jump skip, then those ads might not get heard by a lot of people.",

I don't bother skipping. Another one I listen to runs one or two ads at the beginning and one at the end, all short, all as part of an hour long show. I seldom skip there either.\n\nOn the other hand, another podcast will interrupt the show with multiple commercials three or four times per episode. I will not listen to *any* of them. Another podcast I listen to interrupts with sportsbook and casino ads. I ain't here for that shit, either.\n\nSo, to get me to listen to ads, it's pretty simple: make 'em short, don't interrupt the show too much, and most of all make them not be about gambling.",

I've made a number of purchases based of products promoted in podcasts, and I'm better for it.... win/win!\n\nBut, if the ads are just silly 'auto-injected' baloney, the content has to be that many notches better to keep me from dropping that podcast. Ads shouldn't be a total waste of time, and good podcasters know this.\n\nYes, podcasters often want to make some money, or at least recoup a bit of their expenses. But, there are better ways to do this. One model I love is Value 4 Value (cf. [https://value4value.info](https://value4value.info) ) Instead of trying to get the listener to follow ads, you're just asking listeners to directly return some value for the value you're providing.\n\nBut, if the ads are carefully selected, inline with the audience, believed in by the podcaster, etc. I find they are often helpful rather than annoying.

If I listen to the ad but don't buy the product, I might as well have skipped it, no? Whereas if 90% of listeners skip, but 10% listen and buy, the advertiser will be pleased.",

Want to know why podcasts are having trouble?  Podcast advertising dollars.  Yes, there are other ways to monetize them like subscriptions, and yes, some podcast ad breaks are too long, but ads are what pay for most podcasts, and when EVERYBODY skips them all the time, it hurts.  You should reward the ones that value your time with shorter ad breaks.    Anyway, I gave you some gold for all the karma you got dinged.",

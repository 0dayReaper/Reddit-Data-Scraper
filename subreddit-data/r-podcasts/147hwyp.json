    "postText": "Maybe more like explain like I'm 16? I've been trying to get into history podcasts and the specific topics I'm interested in are pretty good, but otherwise I find myself getting bored or disengaged. However I would really like to have a more general understanding of important historical events. \n\nI know these things can't always be so simple but any suggestions for pods would be appreciated. I've been listening to HI101 and it's okay but I think something else might suit me better. Or any advice on how to stay engaged while listening! I feel like a lot of my problem is that what I've listened to so far is just so much information at once and it becomes overwhelming. Thanks!",

It\u2019s a comedy/entertainment adjacent pod hosted by Greg Jenner who is a public historian (and was the resident historian for the kids horrible histories TV show). It\u2019s really good.\n\nIt has Greg, a guest academic expert in the chosen era/person/subject and then a guest comedian (being the voice of the public). There are radio edit versions (it is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the 6.30pm comedy slot) and full eps. \n\nIt\u2019s probably my favourite \u2018edutainment\u2019 pod!",

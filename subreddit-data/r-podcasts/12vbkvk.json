That\u2019s one of the main things that irks me and I know it\u2019s such a petty thing but I can\u2019t help it. \n\nIn general I do like her, but I don\u2019t subscribe to her podcast, she has a gazillion episodes so every now and then I\u2019ll just look at what she\u2019s recently put out and listen to certain things that are interesting to me.",

She says she was a intern during the ML scandal at the WH and that guy in the video liked her, I don\u2019t see either of those things as big deals. And she saw the hijacker at the post store, which again I don\u2019t see as a big thing. Just interesting tidbits from someone\u2019s life. I think most of us interesting stories like these.",

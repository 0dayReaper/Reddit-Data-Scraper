    "postText": "I\u2019m a little surprised that podcasts have become as popular as they are with a young audience. If you\u2019re say, 30 years old or less, do you ever listen to radio news or talk-radio? How about old-time radio shows or newer radio drama? Is listening to podcasts something you\u2019re surprised that you enjoy?\n\nFeel free to tell me anything else about your podcast listening. I\u2019m not a journalist or anything, just someone who listens to a lot of podcasts and interested to hear other people\u2019s thought about podcast listening.",

Lots of old stories have free or cheap readings available but the quality is bad and I\u2019m sure this should be good quality.",

Which is very neat. (Estates can apply to extend their trademark, Disney is notorious for doing so, if not Mickey Mouse would be in the public domain by now. That is just a fun fact) \n\nDarn it, I don\u2019t know much about public libraries in Asia. I actually know nothing. Do you have a library system nearby? In the US we have an app with a great interface that connects to most local libraries, giving us access to ebooks, audiobook, magazines and sometimes movies. Do you know if anything of the sort exists by you? Definitely worth doing some research. I would be interested to know what options are available",

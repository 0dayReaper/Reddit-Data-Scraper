    "postText": "I've listened to a few episodes of the podcast \"Thinking Clearly\" and enjoyed it very much. It is listed in science and culture for topics, but the consistent theme is the critical thinking process. Although I've only recently come across this pod, it's quickly earned a spot on my favorites list. Hosted by a former chemist, counselor and psychology professor, they know what questions to ask to get me thinking. Most importantly, there is discussion of ALL aspects of a subject. Really great at hitting several perspectives/talking points. The unbiased approach is also what I prefer. I get so tired of hearing people use such aggressive and hateful words to describe someone from the opposing perspective.",

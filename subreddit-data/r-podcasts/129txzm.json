    "postText": "Hi -\n\nI heard Chris Gethard on another podcast talking about this show, specifically the episode called Prison Bound about the woman who was days away from turning herself in to a federal prison.  It was such a fantastic episode.  \n\nI\u2019d like to get deeper into this podcast but with nearly 400 available episodes I\u2019m not sure where to begin. \n\nSo, to those of you who are already fans of the show, what are some of your favorite episodes?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "I'd say the first 10 or so were really good. Gethard and the callers are new to it and feeling each other out. Once people realized what he was doing the calls always felt a lot more performative to me. I listened for maybe a year and then felt episodes didn't really have the \"magic\" of the first episodes.",

            "comment": "It depends on the vibe you want. Some episodes are incredibly silly, some are informative, others heartbreaking. If you can specify what type you want, I can give more pointed advice. But for a general rundown of good episodes (in order from oldest to newest but there\u2019s not really an order I suggest other than the first one): \n\n- Ron Paul\u2019s Baby is the obvious place to start. The pilot, the place the show gets its start, an iconic caller. \n- Strangers on a Train for a voyeuristic glimpse into someone\u2019s present. \n- A Spooky Episode always gives me a good laugh. \n- Vinyl Market Researcher is a good one if you feel in need of motivation. \n- Love is Everywhere is a must listen but you\u2019ll need to be in the right headspace for it. It\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster. \n- Aussie Best Friend for a fun hour. \n- The Puppet Master for when you need to cry from laughing too hard. \n- Prison Bound as you mentioned. \n- Motor City Mayhem for a fun chill vibe. \n- Library Boy for a captivating story. \n\nOne of the greatest things about this podcast is I never really know which ones are going to stick with me until I\u2019ve listened. The titles don\u2019t always do the caller justice. I\u2019ve listened to nearly every episode of this podcast since the start and I recommend it to everyone I can. Happy listening! Hope this helps.",

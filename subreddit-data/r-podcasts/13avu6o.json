I know some shows have their own system, but it is very spotty and for someone like me who likes to jump around it's not really an option.\n\nDo you know of any resources that looked into that topic? Any promising projects on the horizon? We need a Freaconomics episode about that :-)",

Parcast was never ever gonna get me to use the horrible Spotify apps even though I loved Medical Murders. Instead I found 10 other just as good podcasts. And now, they've canceled most of the podcasts because I wasn't the only one that didn't follow like they thought I would.\n\nThese companies have all miscalculated badly, mostly because they think TV/Movie watchers are the same exact sort of people as podcasts listeners.",

They bought up Wondery - they still release Wondery podcasts to the general public with ads, nothing has changed. *But* if you have an Amazon Music/Amazon Prime subscription, you can listen to all Wondery podcasts completely ad-free on that app.",

As a result, the number of podcast producers who have a reasonable following and create decent content is *huge*, compared to the number of movie/TV producers. So any attempt at a common platform will have to work with a very large number of producers - most of whom are not part of a network and have no pre-existing relationships between themselves, and probably have wildly divergent needs and belief systems around revenue generation. It is definitely gonna be more trouble than it is worth.\n\nIt's also funny that you bring up Netflix ... These days I only hear about Netflix when people complain about how the things they want to watch are *not* on Netflix, but on some obscure streaming service owned by the producers of the show. If anything, TV shows/movies are going the way of podcasts - asking folks to pay for things separately than as a bundle!",

Get the RSS feed, make a call to chatGPT API to get the timestamps for the ads and then skip them when playing. Especially since ads are often repeated this would be very easy to find.   \n\n\nI would never release it though as I want to support the creators, not damage them. But yeah, I think sooner or later this is coming from someone and worst case scenario is that creators stop using RSS feeds and things become even more fragmented.",

When your entire business model (from the perspective of an advertiser) is predicated around people paying to AVOID your product, your product is bad. \n\nPodcast ads are incredibly obnoxious and intrusive and I make it a point to *avoid* the companies that place them. Instead of building brand awareness, they actually prompt me to seek out competitors. This is, presumably, not the desired effect.\n\nMany shows now have ad breaks that are 3, 4, or 5 minutes long -- sometimes multiple times during an episode. That's not great. Spotify Premium somehow doesn't skip ads and, in fact, adds MORE unskippable advertisements in (the argument is that you can still skip them by using the phone UI, but this is difficult and quite dangerous when driving; you know, one of the most common if not the primary time that podcasts are consumed). \n\nThing is, though, I too would like to support creators. I'm not, however, going to subscribe to three different services and four different Patreon accounts and Sarah Koenig's dog's Onlyfans page in order to remove ads. There needs to be a single way I can pay something like $10 a month and just not have ads on podcasts.",

Along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019re Wrong About.\u201d  I love Sarah Marshall, but sometimes I just want the story without philosophical comparisons.  I recently listened to an audiobook about the Donner Party, which I loved.  So I enjoy the deep dives and I\u2019m not against violence or gore.  I love learning new things and being informed on historical inaccuracies we learned in school.  TYIA!",

I can't recommend them enough.",

Seems weird, I know, but Bass actually traveled and did the ROSCOSMOS training for a reality tv show that was never filmed, so he's very insightful on the topic, and he's a very good host overall. \n\nAnyway, the pod is mostly about Sergei Krikalev getting stranded on Mir during the dissolution of the USSR. \n\nThis is definitely my new favourite pod!",

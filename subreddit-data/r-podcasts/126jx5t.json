Just another cold case wrapped in a veneer of heightened respectability and intellectual rigor thanks to the Serial name. Everything here including meditations on the mutability and unreliability of memory and witness accounts has been done to death and done better.",

She confronts the conflicting stories people have told themselves about the crime because of an unexpected development: the arrest of a former Laramie police officer accused in the murder. All eight episodes of \"The Coldest Case in Laramie\" a new show from Serial Productions and The New York Times, are available on Thursday, February 23rd wherever you get your podcasts.",

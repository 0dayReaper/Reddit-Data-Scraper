It's so surprising to me how often guests are asked to return to shows were they just drag out the episode, don't understand the concept or are proud of being ignorant in a show where some knowledge is required. The lack of quality control is pretty shocking to me for some very popular shows.\n\nAlso, laughing and talking about stuff that happened \"off-mic\" isn't funny to the listener. We can't see what's happening in the studio, we just hear some people laughing about a joke none of us understand.",

When they're recording normally, hosts are making the show for Us, the podcast listener. When they're at a live show they're, understandably, performing mainly for the audience right in front of them and we're just listening in afterwards. I love MBMBAM, but their live episodes are by far their worst ones.\n\nThe one show that I can think of where I don't see an appreciable difference in quality between live shows and normal shows is No Such Thing As A Fish. Somehow they manage to thread that needle, making it enjoyable for the live audience without sacrificing quality for the podcast listeners.",

Graham seems like a big teddy bear, Dave seems very uptight a bit neurotic. They are both hysterically funny, and don't take anything except maybe ice cream seriously.",

I am a woman, and made that distinction precisely BECAUSE there's a prevalent idea throughout many communities on reddit that 1.) Women aren't as funny as men, and/or 2.) That female hosted or female driven entertainment is \"for girls\" and that as men they wouldn't get anything out of it because it's just a \"chick flick\" or whatever derogatory term you wanna call it. Obviously, that idea is patently absurd, (along with the first idea) since women routinely take in entertainment created by men and get plenty out of it and are able to relate to it and see themselves in the male characters. \n\nSo, because of these bullshit ideas so frequently bandied about, knowing that a lot of men feel this way, when I mentioned All Killa No Filla and the fact that it's an all female podcast, I put the disclaimer in to say to any men who may immediately be turned off to the idea of listening to two women, again, dismissing it as \"for girls\", that they're not just funniest women, they're the funniest people, period, men included-don't get twisted. \n\nOften, women get classified as their gender first, and then their profession second. So for example, female rappers, or the best female rapper. And that's bullshit because that demarcation shouldn't even be there, it should just be, Megan Thee Stallion is one of the best rappers in the game right now, not Meg The Stallion is one of the best female rappers. You get it, because in a misguided internet comment, you attempted to chide me for it. \n\nAs for your one to one comparison about if I did that to a male led podcast, it makes no sense, because men are the default. No one has ever classified anything a man has done with the \"best male (blank)\", because MOST things are run by men, so that specification (pejorative, really) isn't needed. So....yeah...are we done?",

I realize I'm in the minority on that, since shows like The Dollop are super popular, but it's a format that got old with me really fast.

Producers (and listeners) forget that comedy is an art\u2014jokes need to be written, performed/landed, and workshopped. Some people have a real talent for comedic improv, but even stand-up comedians work their material like crazy back when they could go on stage.\n\nI've also found that social pressure, i.e., a laugh track / audience that you hear in the background can also make some jokes seem funnier than if you only heard them in isolation.\n\nMy point is that I don't expect comedians to be funny all the time, just like I don't expect 90% of jokes/shenanigans to \"land\". But I have noticed\u2014along the same lines\u2014as your OP sentiment, that I wouldn't mind less frequent publishing (there's a glut of content out there anyway), and a little more time that is put into writing/editing/production.",

Remarkably like market trading.\n\nThe non comedian is funnier while in context to their authentic point of view, but misses (most but not all the time) what a pro will attempt to catch big laughs on-deliberate twists out of context as comedic technique. It can be done several ways, subtle or overt but the bar is lower everywhere and it\u2019s a skill set.\n\nSpeculating on correlate causes of not being a funny pro would be not having found enough authenticity in one\u2019s comedic point of view or voice can contribute to the tin man factor of not hitting bullseye.  It isn\u2019t easy, in fact, comedy is the cutting edge of culture and not music or dance in terms of difficulty- that is why it is king and pays cash.  George Carlin told us he didn\u2019t find his voice till age 56.\n\nThe other side of the coin here is that audiences have changed.  Once, in the artistic production context, they were part of a conversation and now they are part of the production yet contribute little.  This may be because of change culturally itself but I think it is more crutching by social media.  Co-fame by proximity without significant production value contribution.  I\u2019m only speculating about that.\n\nLastly culture is at a precipice in that we\u2019re backsliding into lesser quality entertainment because so much of the rest of society is running in reverse.  Speculation there as well.  Leave it to a comedian to voice a Shakespearian \u201cTragidian\u2019s  lament\u201d in such diplomatic terms.",

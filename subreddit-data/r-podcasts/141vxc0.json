There is a good chance people who have worked on your favorite podcasts are affected by these job cuts.  \n\nI find Spotify's press release deeply cynical. They boast all their growth numbers, how they are the market leader and talk about \"maximizing consumption\" (yuck!) and two paragraphs later they say it is necessary to fire the very people that produced these numbers for them.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Do you listen to any Gimlet or Parcast productions? Does this change how you see Spotify? Do you maybe even agree these cuts are necessary to stay competitive?",

I'm sure it would have been hard to turn down the millions Spotify offered but I feel like it's been pretty clear for awhile that Spotify is bad for podcasts: as an app to listen to them, as a consumer of podcasts, and as a company that produces podcasts.",

However, I always perceived them to be pretty successful because of this easy accessibility to the subject matter. \n\nI feel like the writing has been on the wall for Gimlet for quite a while. Even before the Reply All scandal, they were having internal issues with their employees and weren\u2019t producing shows very consistently. It\u2019s a shame because I\u2019ve liked a lot of their stuff and I feel like they were very good at thinking outside the box and producing quality content. \n\nStill, this is sad and ominous news for the podcasting world and I feel for the people who will be losing their jobs.",

All of the shows will suffer because there won't be as much talent there to provide a good product. \n\nThis is the same model that Wallmart, and the other big box stores have used, and it hurts us all overall. A lot of great people are going to be without a job, and there are fewer smaller companies to turn to. \n\nFuck Spotify. I will never sign up for their shitty service.",

Until they were bought by Spotify and the podcasts were moved over to Spotify exclusively. I then stopped listening to all of them because I didn't want to support the walled garden ecosystem. I of course hoped they would eventually end up back in the open....but I will take this result as well as it may encourage this big companies to stop sucking in podcasts to make them exclusives. I say that as someone who has a Spotify Premium account anyway so could listen if I wanted to.",

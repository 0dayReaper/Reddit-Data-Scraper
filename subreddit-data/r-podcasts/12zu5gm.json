    "postText": "I've really been enjoying the Chilluminati podcast and have just gotten into Talking With Shadows and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for similar podcasts. Specifically stuff about aliens and UFOs.\n\nI'm new to podcasts and don't quite know where to go lol. Chilluminati got me interested in the idea of podcasts and then I found TWS. Beyond that, everything I've tried to listen to has been borderline religious or too right wing for my tastes. Just want people talking about fun stories and wacky theories lol",

It's by Payne Lindsey, the guy behind Radio Rental. (First season of Radio Rental was great, by the way. True stories of bizarre happenings, told by regular people.)\n\nUncanny by Danny Robins is a really good one about ghosts and hauntings.",

    "postText": "Looking for podcasts were a group of friends discuss nerdy stuff and funny life stories. Stuff like Distractible and Ear Biscuits. \n\n# The shows you recommend, must meet all the criteria below.\r\n\n***1****. Must be a pair or group of friends. No solo podcasts please.* \n\n***2****. Must include a broad array of topics.*  \n\n***3.*** ABSOLUTLY no sexism (towards males or females) and no racism (towards any race, no bashing on whites, blacks, Asians, etc). The only exception is if the hosts are clearly joking and not actually in support of either of those two things.",

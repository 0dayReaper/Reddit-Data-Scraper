Normally, that would be fine, expect right now there\u2019s a hiccup. I\u2019ve got a very young child at home. Given my level of sleep deprivation; my emotional desire for ghosts to be real; and the fact I\u2019ve joked about Eva, our house ghost for ten years. I\u2019m not sure I should be engaged in 24/7 horror content. \nWhat suggestions do you have that aren\u2019t intended to make your spine tingle?",

You could do Best Friends, a podcast about friendship hosted by 2 comedians and it\u2019s just silly nonsense mostly, and sometimes friendship advice.

I also started listening to Pop Culture Happy Hour once I had kids and couldn\u2019t keep up with new movies/tv/music anymore.  I mostly only listen to light stuff, so let me know if any of that is in the right direction and I can try to pitch more.",

Perfect segway for you.\n\nwho killed avrile levine - a little sci fi, a little action, comedy, 90s references.\n\nthe ballad of uncle drank - hilarious, and IMO the best podcast in this list. It's like a parody of jimmy buffet.\n\nbeef and dairy network - deadpan, dry humor. Absurdist at times.\n\npodcast but outside - title kinda sums it up.\n\ngoods from the woods - just some comedians hangin out. I generally avoid this genre, because comedians tend to spend more time talking about the business of comedy than they do being funny, but these guys bring a good vibe, and rarely get sucked into talking about 'the biz'. Also, if you go back to the older episodes, it's a different vibe. They lost a very charismatic third host, but they managed to keep the boat chuggin along just fine.\n\nmy town - light humor, mystery/adventure. main character creates podcast to save his dad's business. End up getting caught up in trying to find a missing boy. Oh, and the main character has a super power- he can read minds, sorta.",

I also like This Podcast Will Kill You, it's about diseases. The Arins are amazing hosts, it's one of my favorite podcasts. \nComedy wise I recommend Dungeons and Daddies, it's a DnD podcasts about normal dads that are flung into the Forgotten Realms and they lose their sons and have to find them. It's really funny, and you don't need to understand DnD to enjoy it.\nAnother comedy pod is Humdrum Drudgery, it's also a DnD podcast, but from the perspective of the tavern workers. The guys that do the show are also really funny. This one just started recently so there's not a ton of episodes out, but they are well worth the wait!",

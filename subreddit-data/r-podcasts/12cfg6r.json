    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve used an android phone my whole life and made the switch to iOS to save some money because my work provided me with an iPhone. I used to use podcast addict to listen to a paywalled podcast using an rss feed. I have tried a half dozen apps on iPhone and none have worked. It is very frustrating. I use Castbox for my non paywalled podcasts, but this one doesn\u2019t work. I have tried following the steps on their website for paywall rss.\n\nPlease give me the name of an app I could use and if it\u2019s complicated if you would guide me through the steps. Thanks",

The occasional hiccup I can deal with, as the overall offering is great.\n\nEXCEPT for the fact that to this day I still get confused by the \"Custom playback speed for this podcast\" toggle. It's either mighty unintuitive or my brain is specifically not wired right to remember what setting to put it into.",

It also features sync (even to their Android app) for a reasonable premium subscription price. And you can import the feed XML from Podcast Addict to transfer your existing collection.",

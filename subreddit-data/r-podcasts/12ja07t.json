I mean everyone in the world, not just you personally.)\n\nFucking hell.  It's not The Prisoner's Dilemma.  These are not mindless automatons you put a quarter into to pull a handle and get some giggle or gasping drama out of.  Life throws enough curveballs at people without their potential SO creating fake drama to \"test\" them.  They're real people, just go fucking date them.  If you're looking to play with people for who-knows-what-might-happen fun, join an improv group.\n\n/rant",

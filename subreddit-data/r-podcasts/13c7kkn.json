    "postText": "I was reading an article in The Week about the podcast a few weeks ago and thought it said that the podcast would have seven episodes plus a longer epilogue, but it's been a while since the seventh episode was released and I haven't seen the epilogue pop up in the feed yet. Will it be added to the feed with all the other episodes or is it going to be somewhere else? I enjoyed the podcast and would not want to miss the last bit, so I've been checking the feed, but I would like to know when to look for it. Also, any suggestions for a podcast network that talks about kind of unique topics related to cartoons, comics, Disney things and early internet history like Pipedream Podcasts would be appreciated",

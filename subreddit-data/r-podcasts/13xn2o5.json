    "postText": "Hi, I'd like some podcast recs please. I have some really tedious work to do, and I'm looking for some funny or interesting non-fiction to listen to.  All the recs I'm finding online are of the \"two dudes in a basement\" style and/or no longer running.  What I'd like is a finite, planned story with no rambling, no dead air, and decent sound quality - so, probably produced by a radio station. \n\nIdeal episode length is 30 min - 1 hour, ideal update frequency between weekly and monthly. I don't have my life together enough to listen to anything serialized. \n\nTopic is mostly open. I've liked Endless Thread, Pop Culture Happy Hour, and Nancy. Did not like Radiolab. Not into true crime, self-help, or other depressing shit. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions? \n\nThanks.",

(don't quote me) I remember this happening and when everything was reported on the news and such when I was kid. \n\nI knew it wasn't great then, to put it mildly. but now I've been mulling it over for a week now about just how bad it actually was. and I've been curious. not sure why I haven't made this post yet. thoughts? thanks :)",

The thing is there are about 8 billion podcasts out there and one way to distinguish yourself from the pack is to have your hosts be distinct. Most long term listeners don't tune in just for the information, they listen because they like the hosts\n\nThere is a limit for most people on how much banter is acceptable of course, and that limit seems to be far shorter for you. It's not wrong for you to dislike banter between hosts but keep in mind you then aren't the key target for that show. You're more of a topic listener, which means you're also more likely not to return to the show if the topic doesn't suit you where fans of the cast are more likely to stick around despite the topic\n\nSo in short as a podcast you either go hard on your personality or you go hard on your shows theme or \"sound\"",

I\u2019m 54 and now I get why older people would sometimes exasperatedly say \u201cI was there!\u201d when younger people were talking out of their butts (including me).\n\nHearing people conjecture in my earholes about something I lived through and then settle on what is probably the truth is maddening. I\u2019ll name one name \u2014 the Karen Carpenter episode of You\u2019re Wrong About, almost a complete lack of putting her life in a context of the times or even the basics of understanding an anorexic/addict mindset. One of the only episodes I\u2019ve argued with out loud and hate listened to the end so I could feel justified in ranting about it. \n\nSo many podcasts have been ruined for me because the host(s) get too comfortable having a takeaway on too many things, if that makes sense. A hollow sage-like quality. That wipes out a lot of recommended podcasts. \n\nI get why IBCK doesn\u2019t work for people, but I can\u2019t get enough of Shamshiri partially because he is careful in his expression, even if his humor is one of outraged ironic exaggeration. Maybe it\u2019s the lawyer training, but he \u201cshows his work\u201d.  He\u2019s been talking about other stuff on their Patreon and I like those episodes more (GameStop, Bari Weiss, yesterday was a breakdown of the Bud Light and Target dramas). I think that might be a better niche for him \u2014 explaining distasteful things going on in the world to people like me who can\u2019t pay attention unless it\u2019s delivered with a lot of sarcastic humor. \n\nI wish he had a different co-host because Hobbes has lost a lot of credibility with me as part of the elevating of Aubrey Gordon as a scientific debunker of health myths, when I don\u2019t think Aubrey could tell you what protein, fat and carbohydrates are. Maintenance Phase is a whole other thing I\u2019ve pontificated enough about on Reddit. It\u2019s bordering on a menace IMO.",

This is so fucked up! :D\" approach), and I was rarely 'wrong' about the topic at hand (because it was something in which I was already interested or had been 'debunked' elsewhere) and where I *was* learning something new, it wasn't that 'enlightening' (more of a 'oh, cool I guess?' reaction).\n\nAll of that combined made it hard to stick with it and seeing the love it gets here and elsewhere left me baffled. Moreso when it's hailed as some kind of revolutionary 'hidden gem', as if it hadn't received a cavalcade of glowing reviews in mainstream press.\n\nThe spin-offs and successors (like **If Books Could Kill**) hold no interest to me because of that first **YWA** dose.

But other than that I skipped right through all the seasons not finding any of the topics interesting. \n\n\\-MfM is also hard to get into.. the girls are a bit unlikeable...\n\n\\-Morbid, same as MFM but they are younger, so maybe more relatable\n\n\\-When killers get caught is good, but you can kind of tell they are still figuring things out. The girl had a TikTok that does pretty well. \n\n\\-Murder in America is pretty theatrical, its got spooky vibes. Zero comedy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The best True Crime podcast IMO is Crime Weekly.**",

I love audiodrama, I love musicals, I love fantasy, I love mysteries\u2026 it should\u2019ve been right up my alley. I just could NOT get into it. I can\u2019t pinpoint what was wrong with it. On paper, it sounds really good! I just felt kind of bored with it.",

I\u2019ve tried multiple times and cannot finish the episodes because I get so annoyed with the scripted reactions from the one girl (i forget names lol). Plus didn\u2019t they get called out for copying at one point?",

In contrast, SGU injects far too much politics into science discussions and always leans left if there\u2019s a way to do so.",

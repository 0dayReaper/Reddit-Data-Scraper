    "postText": "Anyone have recommendations for podcasts that bring on experts to talk about their field of study? I've been really digging Factually with Adam Conover and I always liked Science Versus. I've enjoyed Your Wrong About too. Podcasts that are mostly guest interview style covering a different topic each episode. I don't mind it getting into politics and banter is fine too if is good banter. Used to listen to 538 when I thought they new what they were talking about. Been into Is This Democracy w/Thomas Zimmer lately too. What else is out there?",

    "postText": "When I first discovered \"Decoder Ring,\" it quickly became one of my favorite podcasts.  But the past year or so have really soured me on the podcast, it seems like it's been completely watered down.  Seasons are now only 4-5 episodes each, and they are peppered with reruns or -- in the case of today's release, as has been done before -- another podcast's episode in the feed.  Seems like a half-assed effort, especially since they keep pushing for subscribers to join and pay for Slate+...  Given how little they're delivering with these seasons, they just don't seem to be making it worth anyone's while to subscribe.\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed this or is feeling similarly about this podcast.  I always feel like I'm \"giving up\" if I unfollow a podcast before it ends, so it makes it easier for me if I'm not the only one who has similar sentiments.",

And it takes a LOT of money for the resources. I just think these \u201chalf-assed\u201d efforts are a direct product of an underpaid staff.",

These podcasts we listen to for free, are made by a person or people who have to actually do a lot of work, usually for very little money.\n\nEven the shows that are with an organization usually don't make any money, compared to what's put into them.",

They're part of Defector, which is worker-owned and part of their Whole Thing is being really transparent about where their subscribers' money is going, and what actually goes into running a media company and its connected podcasts.  I'm a fan of theirs anyway but it's also pretty fascinating to hear how the sausage is made.\n\nI *think* [this](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bonus-2-your-faq-some-big-announcements/id1597761181?i=1000559537900) and [this](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-business-announcement-episode-new-partner-and-new/id1597761181?i=1000601588592) are the best ones to listen to, as well as [Defector's annual reports](https://defector.com/defector-annual-report-year-two)",

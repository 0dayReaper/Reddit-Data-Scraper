    "postText": "Here's a little back story: My wife and I are in our late 30s. We're text book leftists from Denver, CO, we drink, smoke weed, cuss like sailors, and have decided not to have kids. My wife's parents are right wing republicans and life long Evangelical Christians in their 60s/70s. Her dad is a pastor and her mom works for the Seventh Day Adventist conference. Her mom LITERALLY has never had a single sip of alcohol in her entire life. \n\nIn June, the 4 of us are driving 12 hours from Denver to Iowa for my wife's family reunion. What podcasts, audiobooks, music, etc. can we listen to on the drive that will accommodate all of us? We're stumped! Please help!\n\nBefore anyone starts talking trash, please know that the 4 of us love each other very much despite our differences. Thanks in advance!",

They occasionally do bring up topics that might cause arguments and occasional swearing in the internet episodes. Found that out when I put it in a list for a family member over the pandemic and then they went on a 30 minute rant about swearing being in the 25th anniversary episode. I didn't even register the swearing so it was surprising. They also went on a rant about a history themed episode not telling the \"right\" history, no idea which one that was I stopped listening to them after they said something stupid and don't recommend them things anymore.\n\nJust a heads for them to read the description at least before choosing episodes.",

My spouse was no longer speaking to me.\n\nBy the time the drive ended I was cackling, drinking cappuccinos, and talking about needing to take a wicked haircut.

There are some interesting topics to avoid-one in particular talks about how long your leg hair grows and it mentions pubic hair- but they are fun and since it\u2019s played on the radio, fairly certain it\u2019s clean. They mention if it\u2019s a bit more naughty, too. The curious cases of Rutherford and Fry. \n\nWind of Change was an amazing well done investigative reporting story. Idk if there\u2019s absolutely no cursing, but it\u2019s a serious take on a stupid conspiracy and sucks you in. \n\nThe Smithsonian has a podcast called \u201cSide Door\u201d. Lots of episodes. There may be some that might be touchy (like the one titled \u201creservation math: navigating live in native America) but there\u2019s sooo many. And it\u2019s the Smithsonian. \n\nI have been engrossed in Blair Braverman\u2019s guest spots on Your Wrong about. The topics of her guest spots were baby Jessica, the Dyotlov Pass, Chris McCandless (into the wild), and the soccer team plane crash in the Andes. I\u2019ve listened to some of them multiple times, Sarah is a great host and Blair a great guest. Sarah usually makes a comment about \u201ccapitalism ruins everything\u201d but I don\u2019t think that happens in any of these. \n\nI do not recommend there\u2019s no such thing as a fish - it\u2019s great and funny but lots of cussing and during the US elections at least one host was not hesitant in letting her political leanings be known.",

Holy shit in this climate??? Ooof I don't envy your conversations.\n\nNormally I would recommend ***Dear Hank &amp; John*** for family trips bc it's got very good mass appeal, they don't swear and it's not raunchy at all...it's a comedic yet sometimes surprisingly earnest and heartwarming advice show. BUT they are center-left/left-wing, and while they don't tend to talk about politics (when they do, it's often more implied than explicit), their values are clearly on progressive side...But maybe it would still be okay because they move from topic to topic fairly quickly. Idk. Anyway, Dear Hank &amp; John's a comedic yet also frequently earnest and heartfelt advice show. Listen to some episodes to get a feel for it.\n\nI also often recommend ***This American Life***, which has some amazing episodes that are not political, raunchy, or swear-y, but you might have to do some research to be sure it's not too much for your errr delicate parents....I think you will find more \"suitable\" apolitical episodes if you go back a decade or more (don't worry, they don't feel outdated).

It's fun, interesting, energetic and creative without being patronising. I've learnt so much from this podcast. It sparked an interest in history which made me start listening to 'A Short History Of' with Dr Who/Withnail &amp; I actor Paul McCann which is interesting and well written and flawlessly delivered, but feels a lot more formal and less engaging, but I still enjoy it.",

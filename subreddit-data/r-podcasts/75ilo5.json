    "postText": "*Tldr; I listen to way too many podcasts. Skip to the very bottom of this long-ass post to see my top recommendations.* **Titles are links** *(this subreddit's css, doesn't make that obvious)*\n\nI have loved podcasts for about 10 years, but for the last 3, due to my job, I have become a 40+ hour a week, power-listener. In that time my lists and recommendations have been very well-received on this sub, and since I'm leaving that job next month, I decided it was time to come up with a master list of my top recommendations across all categories.\n\nFirst of all: These are just my opinions. If your favorite show didn't make this list, don't get mad at me, just go ahead and shout it out in the comments. I put a lot of thought into the ranking, but if you ask me next week I'll probably have changed my mind on a lot of it.\n\nI have no qualifications to review podcasts except for the fact that I listen to way too many of them. Actually, the real reason I wanted to make this list was because I think the lists I've seen written by qualified reviewers are usually really bad, imo. I always feel like the reviewer has listened to like 60 podcasts, and is listing their top 50. I have no idea how many podcasts I've listened to but it's got to be in the thousands, and there are soooo many great shows out there, so I thought it's my duty to share. \n\n100 shows is actually only a subset of the shows I like. At first this list grew to over 200 and I was still thinking of more. So I decided to cut it at my favorite 100 and I added three criteria to help cull it down:\n\n1. **It must be active**: Some day I'll make a list of my favorite dead podcasts, but none are on this list.\n\n2. **It must have at least 10 episodes**: I think 10 episodes in is a decent trial period. If I've listened to less than that I don't feel comfortable recommending it. Also there's a trend right now of shows putting out one 8-10 episode season, and then just never renewing to a second season. So, if it has more than 10 episodes, I feel like it has staying power.\n\n3. **It must be interesting for general audiences**: Podcasts tend to be topical. That makes it a little tough to recommend them if I don't know you, because you might not be into the topic of the show. So I have only included shows that I think you don't need too much specific knowledge to enjoy (either because the topic is general, or because it's fun even for the non-initiated.)\n\nI'm sure at some point I screwed up on those rules, but they were the guidelines I was working from.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**: First here are some *smaller podcasts* that didn't quite make it into my top 100 but I still think you should check out: \n\nThis is why you're single, Doughboys, Do By Friday, Hopefully We Don't Break-Up, Roundtable of Gentlemen, Mental Illness Happy Hour, Sleepycast,  James O'Brien's Mystery Hour, Nocturne Podcast, Quirks and Quarks, Put Your Hands Together, Book Shambles, Sex &amp; Other Human Activities, Singing Bones, A Taste of the Past, We Fact Up, The Bridge, Step By Stapp, Return Home, Movie Sign with the Mads, Save it for the Show, The F Plus, Next Picture Show, Be Here For a While, Code Breaker, Goosebuds\n\nOk, with no further ado . . . \n\n**The List**: In reverse order\n\n**100**\\. *[I Tell My Husband the News](https://soundcloud.com/itellmyhusbandthenews)*, A news-reporter reads current headlines to her husband, who is a comedian. Not exactly cutting edge satire, but I love this show for the hosts' chemistry. They are super in love and incredibly cute together. They just make me happy. And their banter is usually legitimately funny.\n\n**99**\\. *[You Must Remember This](http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/)*, True stories from old hollywood narrated over lush, old-fashioned movie music. The stories are great and give you a window into the crazy world of movies in the black and white era.\n\n**98**\\. *[8-Bit Book Club](https://headgum.com/8-bit-book-club)*, Three funny nerds read through old novelizations of video games. The books are ridiculous and the hosts make fun of them mercilessly. Great host chemistry. Tons of fun.\n\n**97**\\. *[Lore](http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/)*, Solo podcast exploring the stories and legends all around us. A tightly written and moodily produced show focused on the tall tales woven into our history.\n\n**96**\\. *[Longform](https://longform.org/podcast)*, Long conversations with writers of non-fiction. Good host and really interesting conversations. A bit slow compared to most of my other podcasts, but satisfying.\n\n**95**\\. *[Superego](http://www.gosuperego.com/)*, Very strange, slightly off-putting, free-association improv comedy. When it's bad it's just weird, when it's good it's magical.\n\n**94**\\. *[Our Fake History](http://ourfakehistory.com/)*, Single host show exploring misconceptions and pseudo-history. Like a Hardcore History for things that didn't actually happen. Host is great and topics are usually very interesting.\n\n**93**\\. *[I Was There Too](http://www.earwolf.com/show/i-was-there-too/)*, Interviews with non-famous people who in some way worked on iconic scenes in famous movies. Fascinating if, like me, you have a love for pop-culture arcana.\n\n**92**\\. *[Shut Up and Sit Down](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/podcastle/)*, Four British comedians talk about and occasionally play board games. Lot of fun, and a lot of goofballery. I don't play a lot of boardgames, but I've bought several because these guys made them sound fun.\n\n**91**\\. *[I Saw That Years Ago](http://www.isawthatyearsago.com/)*, Two witty guys talk about movies they don't quite remember. The concept doesn't actually do much, this show is all about the chemistry between the hosts which is fantastic.\n\n**90**\\. *[Duncan Trussel Family Hour](http://www.duncantrussell.com/)*, Comedian Duncan Trussel invites guests on for long rambling conversations. Stands out for Duncan's odd choice of guests and the unique, weird nature of the conversations he engages them in.\n\n**89**\\. *[The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone)*, Goofy brothers play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Took me several tries to get into this show (beginning's a little rough and I don't play D&amp;D.) But I kept giving it chances because of some strong recommendations, and it does blossom into some really unique storytelling.\n\n**88**\\. *[Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/)*, Very NPR show about money and our world and the interplay between economics and our daily life. Fun and listenable in spite of the dreary subject matter. Has some really great education about dollars and cents that we really should all be listening to.\n\n**87**\\. *[Giant Bombcast](http://www.giantbomb.com/podcasts/)*, The crew of a gaming magazine get together and shoot the shit about games, life and everything in a long and rambling discussion. \n\n**86**\\. *[Burnt Toast](https://food52.com/p/burnt-toast)*, Conversations and researched features on food, food culture, and it's relationship to daily life. Lovingly produced and charmingly performed. An absoulte delight.\n\n**85**\\. *[Fireside Mystery Theatre](http://www.firesidemysterytheatre.com/podcast)*, Storytelling and variety show done in front of a live audience. The stories are usually a lot of fun, and the theatre atmosphere adds a fun unique quality to it. \n\n**84**\\. *[Opening Arguments](http://openargs.com/)*, A lawyer and a comedian chat about the law. Sort of like Star Talk, but for legal questions. The hosts perfectly hit the balance of informative and engaging. Law affects all our daily lives and it's something that most people know bupkis about, and I love that this show does a great job of making it accessible. \n\n**83**\\. *[Comedy Bang! Bang!](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/)*, One of the old staples of podcasting. Loose format comedy show usually involving interviews followed by some light improv. Still a great show after all these years.\n\n**82**\\. *[The Black Tapes](http://theblacktapespodcast.com/)*, Ghost stories, but in the form of a \"non-fiction\" journalistic podcast. Really well-told with a dark and brooding tone. A weaker second season has dropped it in my esteem but still great.\n\n**81**\\. *[Never Not Funny](http://pardcast.com/)*, Comedian plus celbrity guest ramble on about nothing in particular. Jimmy Pardo is a great host and has a wonderfully cutting sense of humor. One of the longest running big podcasts. Very rarely not funny.\n\n**80**\\. *[Leicester Square Theatre Podcast](https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/)*, Comedian Richard Herring does one-on-one interviews with comedians in which he asks them stupid and ridiculous questions. Throws out the formal interview format and just has fun. Having a big live audience elevates it.\n\n**79**\\. *[Rocket](https://www.relay.fm/rocket)*, A few tech journalists run a show about general geek topics, with an emphasis on tech. Perfect balance of smart informational chat and good host chemistry.\n\n**78**\\. *[We're Alive](https://www.werealive.com/listen/)*, Audiodrama about a Zombie infestation.  Very good writing and acting and probably the best-produced serial scripted story podcast. Great use of tension throughout.\n\n**77**\\. *[Greg Proops Film Club](https://soundcloud.com/gpfc)*, I've always loved Greg Proops' wacky smart-guy comedy, but his main podcast doesn't work for me as well as this one, where the theme of chatting about movies and geekery keeps him more on task. And through all the joking, he has a lot more interesting stuff to say than most of the serious movie podcasts.\n\n**76**\\. *[Harmontown](https://art19.com/shows/harmontown)*, Comedy writer Dan Harmon plus friends talk nonsense and generally have fun. Mostly funny with occasional seriousness. Harmon is a great lovable asshole and the podcast format is perfect for him. Does fun and interesting things with the basic talk-show format.\n\n**75**\\. *[Smash Cut](http://smashcutthepodcast.com/)*, Storytelling via dialogue collage. Wonderfully unique show that ranges from gripping to tragic to avant-guard. May be too weird for some, but hits a sweetspot for me.\n\n**74**\\. *[Desert Island Discs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr/episodes/downloads)*, Celebrities are interviewed with the same question: If you were stuck on a desert island, what five albums would you want to have with you. Mostly a conversation about music, but it expands into a bigger conversation about the guest's life and influences.\n\n**73**\\. *[No Such Thing As a Fish](http://qi.com/podcast)*, The writers of a British trivia show go into depth on the obscure knowledge they've been researching and ramble on about arcane knowledge. Smart people chatting casually about smart things. Usually very interesting to listen to.\n\n**72**\\. *[Blank Check](https://soundcloud.com/griffin-and-david-present)*, Movie discussion pod that perfectly hits the balance between smart discussion and levity. The premise is talking about director's who get license to do whatever they want (the titular blank check), but it's really a pretty freewheeling conversation. Phenomenal chemistry between the hosts.\n\n**71**\\. *[The Future of Everything](http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/browse/wsj-the-future-of-everything)*, Wall Street Journal's interesting impecabbly researched radio-style features on technologies and ideas that are pushing our world into an uncertain future.\n\n**70**\\. *[The Memory Palace](http://thememorypalace.us/)*, Bite sized stories from 18th - 20th century history, told with interest and pathos. Focusing on the human story behind the story of our recent past.\n\n**69**\\. *[The Orbiting Human Circus of the Air](http://orbitinghumancircus.com/podcast.html)*, Silly absurdist storytelling about a radio show that records in the Eiffel Tower. This show is not for everyone, but if it hooks you it is delightful and charming and always a joy to listen to.\n\n**68**\\. *[Imaginary Worlds](http://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/)*, Serious discussions exploring the quirky little details of the worlds of popular fantasy and sci-fi franchises. Done as a host monologue, interspersed with interviews of experts and fans. I love the way he parses out interesting aspects of those worlds and tries to envision how they would really work.\n\n**67**\\. *[Hello From the Magic Tavern](https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/)*, Improv comedy set in a fantasy world with a diverse cast of funny improvisers playing far-out fantastical characters. Solidly funny and always fun to disappear into their goofy mythical world.\n\n**66**\\. *[The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/)*, Interview show with all types of guests. One of the most succesful podcasts in the world. It's a bit love-it-or-hate-it, and while I mostly love it, it can get on my nerves at times. Very hard for me to rank this one for that reason. But I must say Joe Rogan is a great interviewer and everyone should give it a try for themselves and find out which side they fall on.\n\n**65**\\. *[In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads)*, Big, heavy intellectual discussions of very serious topics in history, art and culture. This one might be a bit too smart for me, tbh, but I try and when I can hook into a topic it's immensely satisfying.\n\n**64**\\. *[Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/)*, Two internet smart guys chat casually about smart and obscure subjects. There's actually not that much to this show, but the hosts are great and they have a very unique chemistry.\n\n**63**\\. *[The Infinite Monkey Cage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w/episodes/downloads)*, British-style panel show where a couple comedians and a couple scientists get together an tackle a difficult science topic and try to find answer. Unlike a lot of science shows, they don't shy away from talking actual science, but the chemistry of the hosts keeps the show always entertaining.\n\n**62**\\. *[Wolf 359](http://www.wolf359.fm/)*, Narrative sci-fi podcast. Intriguing space travel story with a quirky sense of humor and good sound design to create a solid sense of atmosphere. Starts simple and blossoms into an awesome story.\n\n**61**\\. *[The Thrilling Adventure Hour](http://thrillingadventurehour.com/)*, Comedians do a parody of an old-fashioned radio play in front of a live audience. So much fun. Best moments are when it breaks down. Was dead for a long time but there have been recent occasional releases so I'm considering it alive and putting it on this list.\n\n**60**\\. *[Doug Loves Movies](http://douglovesmovies.com/)*, Comedian Doug Benson has several celebrity guests on each episode to talk movies and play games. The quintessential podcast for me. Slightly too lose and quirky to ever have worked as a radio show.  Usually funny and always fun.\n\n**59**\\. *[a16z](https://a16z.com/podcasts/)*, Science and Tech podcast with interviews of actual scientists doing cutting edge work. Can be a bit dry, but I love how in depth it is, and that it doesn't dumb it down to a grade school level like a lot of similar shows.\n\n**58**\\. *[The Football Ramble](http://www.thefootballramble.com/)*, Four dudes with amazing chemistry talking bullshit and football (soccer) and just generally mocking each other and having a blast while doing it. I listen to a lot of sports podcasts but few are so good (and general-audience friendly enough) that I would recommend them to all podcast listeners. But this one is just tons of fun.\n\n**57**\\. *[Theory of Everything](https://toe.prx.org/)*, Loose think-pieceish conversations about life and technology and the connections between things. Really interesting and well thought-out.\n\n**56**\\. *[The Truth](http://www.thetruthpodcast.com/)*, Short non-serial audio dramas. Stories range from serious to silly, often strange and off-kilter. Very well produced and performed, but the best part is the writing, which is awesomely creative and interesting.\n\n**55**\\. *[Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/reply-all/)*, One of many thinkpiece shows on this list. This one sets itself apart by focusing on internet-related stories. There's a whimsical nature to the hosts which gives the show a unique sort of charm.\n\n**54**\\. *[Spontaneanation](http://www.earwolf.com/show/spontaneanation-with-paul-f-tompkins/)*, Paul F Tompkins has an interview with a famous person and then leads a long-form improv scene. Usually very funny simply because Tompkins is so funny. \n\n**53**\\. *[Candidate Confessionals](https://soundcloud.com/candidate-confessional)*, Interviews with losing candidates (or people who worked on losing campaigns) done as sort-of autobiographies telling the story of how a campaign fails. Fascinating deconstruction of politics from a new angle. Refreshingly honest at times.\n\n**52**\\. *[Mouth Time!](https://art19.com/shows/mouth-time-with-reductress)*, Absurdist show that parodies the vapid beauty mag culture but taken to the extreme. Part way between absurdism, improv comedy, and an actual pop cultuer podcast.\n\n**51**\\. *[The Black List Table Read](https://blcklst.com/podcast/)*, Audio performances of industry movie scripts that haven't gotten made. The concept is fabulous and the actors do a great job. Unique storytelling podcast with wonderful production. Some of the scripts are really great. Held back a bit by the fact that movie scripts aren't always written to be read out loud. \n\n**50**\\. *[2 Dope Queens](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens)*, Two sassy ladies host a comedy podcast with guests that  chat with them or do their stand-up acts. Love the energy of the hosts. Generally great when the guests are good.\n\n**49**\\. *[Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](http://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/)*, Two divinity professors use their techniques of scholarly bibilcal analysis on the Harry Potter books. Silly concept but they take it completely seriously. The result is part deep textual dive into the Potter-verse, and part reflection/conversation on life in general. Wonderfully introspective. Somehow both heavy and light at the same time. \n\n**48**\\. *[Monday Morning Podcast](http://billburr.com/podcast-2/)*, Weekly show of the ramblings of comedian Bill Burr. Zero production or planning, just unfiltered Bill, who delivers the entire show in his trademark angry monologue. Usually funny, but that's not the reason it made this list: What makes this show stand out for me is its personal and honest nature. If you can get past Burr's abrassiveness, definitely worth a listen.\n\n**47**\\. *[The Adam Buxton Podcast](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/category/adam-buxton-podcast/)*, Comedian interviews celebrities. It's hard to stand out in this crowded genre, but this show does due to the host's magnetism and energy, and the quirkiness of the show's production, with little songs throughout (including the ads), and lots of silly digressions. And at it's heart, Adam is an excelent interviewer who gets a lot out of his guest.\n\n**46**\\. *[Anxious Machine](http://www.anxiousmachine.com/)*, Introspective think-pieces about the human mind and how it works in human society. Usually done through interview intersperced with host commentary. The stories sit in a sweetspot between the personal and the general in a unique way.\n\n**45**\\. *[The Flop House](http://www.flophousepodcast.com/)*, Three guys watch a bad movie and talk about it. The real joy, though, is in the constant flights of fancy when they say something dumb or misspeak that cascade into jokes that they follow to their logical conclusion. At its best it\u2019s a top 10 podcast, but I feel like its lost some of its fastball lately, so its fallen on my list.\n\n**44**\\. *[Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast](http://www.gilbertpodcast.com/)*, I think Gottfried is one of the funniest guys in show business. This is his interview show, where he talks mostly to comedians, mostly about comedy. If you can handle his voice, it's a really wonderful show.\n\n**43**\\. *[Laser Time](http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/category/lasertimepodcast/)*, Friends shooting the shit is probably the most common podcast genre, and one that I listen to a lot of, but not a lot of those made this list because while they may be listenable, they are rarely notable. Laser Time is a major exception in that the chemisty of the hosts and the odd specificity of the pop culture arcana they talk about makes the show consistently fun and fascinating.\n\n**42**\\. *[How did this get Made?](http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/)*, Three comedians and a guest review bad films. This show might be lost among the sea of decent/good comedy podcasts if not for the work of Jason Mantzoukas, who is imo the funniest man in podcasting.\n\n**41**\\. *[This Feels Terrible](http://www.feralaudio.com/show/this-feels-terrible-with-erin-mcgathy/)*, Comedienne interviews other comedians about dating and love and relationships. Host has a lovely easy style that is good for getting people talking about really personal stuff. Has great chemistry with most guests.\n\n**40**\\. *[Beef and Dairy Network Podcast](http://www.beefanddairynetwork.com/)*, Comedy podcast pretending (with a completely straight face) to be an actual beef and dairy specialty pod. The result is very high-quality absurdist comedy.\n\n**39**\\. *[Here's The Thing](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething)*, Alec Baldwin interviews celebrities. The tone is very NPR but Baldwin keeps it a bit tighter than your average radio show. TBH, most of the time when a famous person decides they want a podcast the show ends up sucking hard, but Baldwin is a charming and natural host and consitently gets great guests. I know some people hate this show but I find it consistently great.\n\n**38**\\. *[My Favorite Murder](http://www.feralaudio.com/show/my-favorite-murder/)*, Two entertaining women talk through and dissect the details of a real-life grisly murder and generally try and figure out whodunit. Keep it pretty light considering how serious the subject matter is but it works because of how fun and interesting the hosts are. (Though it is guilty of my biggest podcast pet-peeve: Taking forever to start the show.)\n\n**37**\\. *[The Bugle](http://thebuglepodcast.com/)*, News and Politics satire with an absurdist twist. Three years ago this was a top-5 podcast for me and then they went on a long hiatus and lost John Oliver. Still great and slowly working its way back up the ranks.\n\n**36**\\. *[Guys We Fucked](http://www.sorryaboutlastnightcomedy.com/guys-we-fucked/)*, Filthy comedy show that's secretly a positive look at serious issues relating to sexuality. The hosts have a good time and keep it light. Their chemistry makes the show great.\n\n**35**\\. *[Common Sense](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/)*, Very heady current events discussion from an outside-the-box perspective. The host is a provocateur who tries to challenge your preconceptions about government and society. I don't always agree with him but he always opens my eyes at the gaps in my own thinking.\n\n**34**\\. *[Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/)*, Malcolm Gladwell's odd little examinations of historical events from a new perspective are fantastic. The first season was very well-thought out, although still finding it's voice. I was very glad that it returned in time to have enough episodes to make itself elligible for this list.\n\n**33**\\. *[Love + Radio](http://loveandradio.org/)*, Interesting people tell their stories in extended, tightly edited interviews. The people are usually non-famous people who have done remarkable things in their lives. Good production and good stories.\n\n**32**\\. *[99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)*, Little think pieces about design and it's role in our everyday life. Impecably researched and always interesting, with a wonderfully charming delivery from its host.\n\n**31**\\. *[The Hilarious World of Depression](https://www.apmpodcasts.org/thwod/)*, Comedian interviews comedians about depression and how it shapes their lives. Genius concept that perfectly hits the sweetspot of using humor to enlighten dark subjects. Fairly new and still finding its feet, but already one of my favorite shows.\n\n**30**\\. *[Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/)*, Reporters explore fascinating and mysterious stories usually in the realm of science and nature and wind their way to answers in a series of tightly cut together interviews. Really tightly produced (sometimes too much so) and very well researched, this show is one of the most iconic podcasts in the medium.\n\n**29**\\. *[Death, Sex &amp; Money](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/)*, Very personal stories about the big decisions in everyday people's lives, done in interviews in a journalistic style. Very heavy sometimes, but really great. Really digs into the real stuff in people's lives.\n\n**28**\\. *[You Made it Weird](http://nerdist.com/podcasts/you-made-it-weird-channel/)*, Very long in-depth celebrity interviews with comedian Pete Holmes as host. A mirror-universe version of WTF, with a young-happy host rather than an angry older one. This doesn't have the same bite as WTF, but it replaces it with a wonderful sense of joy. Both hosts have mastered the art of the long interview. \n\n**27**\\. *[Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/)*, Serious journalism, but with a slightly more of a conversational tone and more production to make it a more entertaining version of a news show. Nevertheless, the subject matter is heavy, and often deadly serious.\n\n**26**\\. *[Overdue](http://overduepodcast.com/)*, A couple funny dudes talk through great classic novels while riffing and making jokes. Spot-on chemistry and a perfect combination of high-brow art and low-brow comedy.\n\n**25**\\. *[Relic Radio](http://www.relicradio.com/otr/)*, I love that podcasts are bringing  back the audiodrama, an artform basically dead for forty years. But few of the new ones can match the originals, back when there was a big industry of daily and weekly shows and hundreds of professional actors and writers churning them out. Relic Radio lovingly curates from over 30 years of successful but forgotten shows to present them to a modern audience. The stories, while old-fashioned, are amazing, well-performed and fully produced with original music.\n\n**24**\\. *[Savage Lovecast](https://www.savagelovecast.com/)*, Call-in advice show about love, sex and life. Whet sets it apart is the kind and charismatic host, who has a gift for cutting to the heart of complex questions. Advice shows are a bit overdone, but he manages to elevate the format with his frankness and his ability to connect the problems we have in our loves, to larger questions we have about our selves.\n\n**23**\\. *[Crimetown](https://gimletmedia.com/crimetown/)*, In depth audio documentary on organized crime in a big city (season 1 was on Providence.) Really well told story that feels tight and informative, while staying entertaining, mostly because the stories themselves are so engaging.\n\n**22**\\. *[Modern Love](http://www.wbur.org/modernlove)*, Essays and stories about love in the modern world, read by famous actors. The pieces themselves are incredible, both joyful and heart-wrending. They often interview the author after, which sometimes makes me wish they would just have the author read it (due to the personal nature of the stories.)\n\n**21**\\. *[Wooden Overcoats](http://www.woodenovercoats.com/)*, Scripted comedic audiodrama about competing funeral homes on a small British island. Very witty. Wonderfully funny and charming. Has probably the best character voice acting in scripted podcasts.\n\n**20**\\. *[Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia)*, This podcast describes itself somewhat grandly as exploring the invisible things that shape everyday life. What it is, is a damn good radio-style interview think-piece show, with an emphasis on the patterns of human behavior. I love the light touch that the hosts give to the show. With a penchant for giving more questions than answers (in a good way).\n\n**19**\\. *[The Best Show with Tom Scharpling](http://thebestshow.net/podcast/)*, Cult show that started in radio over a decade ago and slowly got weirder as it went. It's an ironic impersonation of a radio call-in show. This is definitely not for everyone; many of you will hate this show. But if you like it you will likely end up loving it. The host is a mad genius of twisting the radio format without ever totally breaking it. Best known for insulting and abusing his call-in listeners.\n\n**18**\\. *[WTF](http://www.wtfpod.com/)*, An angry old comedian interviews famous people in great depth. Marc Maron's gift is in getting people speaking from the heart, and in breaching personal subjects that don't usually get talked about in interviews. WTF is often funny, usually fascinating and occasionally heartbreaking.\n\n**17**\\. *[Alice Isn't Dead](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/aliceisntdead/)*, Weird, creepy, wonderfully produced and performed fictional story about a woman on a journey to find someone she lost. Uniquely moody and moving. Poetic to the point that it might be considered self-indulgent, so it might not be for everyone. But if you dive in, it's an incredible journey.\n\n**16**\\. *[The Moth](https://themoth.org/)*, Personal stories told by a wide set of writers in front of a live audience. Usually funny and often touching in a smart-NewYorker-piece sort of way. Curated from a larger set of stories, and it shows: The stories are more consistently good than most of these types of shows. \n\n**15**\\. *[The Church of What's Happening Now](http://joeydiaz.net/podcast/)*, Comedian Joey Coco Diaz plus guest (usually comedians) trade life-stories. Diaz is really funny, as are most of his guests, but what stands out is Diaz's unique comedic voice and how he can talk about the really heavy stuff in his life in a funny way. And he is just overflowing with stories. He has had a crazy life.\n\n**14**\\. *[Strangers](http://www.storycentral.org/strangers/)*, Tough, beautiful personal stories examined in interviews with leather-voiced Lea Thau (I mean that in a good way: love her voice, it's like a smoked Nina Simone). It's like little audio documentaries about everyday people who have been through extraordinary personal turmoil. Beautiful stories, beautifully told.\n\n**13**\\. *[The Mortified Podcast](http://getmortified.com/podcast/)*, Grown-ups read their childhood journals  to a live audience along with embarassing stories and memories about being kids. On one level it's really funny to hear their skewed childhood perceptions but also there's something amazingly cathartic about sharing in the embarassment. At least for me, being able to laugh at it makes me feel better about my own messed up childhood, and realize that all the stuff I was trying to hide, is the exact same stuff that everyone else was feeling as well.\n\n**12**\\. *[Snap Judgment](http://snapjudgment.org/podcast)*, Great true-stories told by the people who lived through them, over some sick beats and tight riffs, all pulled together by my favorite host in podcasting. \n\n**11**\\. *[Here Be Monsters](http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/here-be-monsters)*, Wonderful stories about suffering and hate and love and all the crazy things that are going on in the human soul. Told mostly through solo interviews with lightly intersperced music and production. The show is very heavy, but very listenable and very real.\n\n**10**\\. *[The Film Reroll](http://www.filmreroll.com/)*, Rotating crew of actors and comedians pick a famous movie and improvise a new version of it with license that anything can happen. Hilarity ensues. The new movies are sublime and ridiculous and often better than the original. They use a dice system to run their stories like a game so they can't decide in advance what will happen. Brilliant concept, perfectly executed. Probably the most pure fun in podcasting.\n\n**9**\\. *[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast)*, Pastiche of stories about the American experience, told in a jounalistic style through interviews. Sometimes sad, sometimes joyful, always interesting. Many smarter things have been said about this show than I can say. Many of the podcasts on this list are in response to or immitation of This American Life, but the original continues to be one of the best examples of the format.\n\n**8**\\. *[Risk!](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=334724074)*, Similar to the Moth, people come on to tell their personal stories. I go back and forth between the two of them as to which I like more. Where the Moth has stories that are more cleverly written, this show feels more real and visceral. The storytellers are less likely to be writers, so we get less polished stories. But this show ultimately gets the nod for me with going to dark places of profound personal drama. Varies greatly in tone from episode to episode, but has been consistently great for a long time now.\n\n**7**\\. *[My Dad Wrote a Porno](http://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/)*, A host and his two friends go chapter-by-chapter through his dad's erotic novel, constantly disecting and laughing about the bizarre and terrible writing. This might honestly be the funniest show in podcasting right now. And while it's mostly light-hearted humor, there's something very compelling about the bizarre view into a man's relationship with his father that comes out from the show's premise.\n\n**6**\\. *[Beautiful/Anonymous](http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/)*, Long phone conversations with anonymous callers who tell personal stories about their lives. The host is a comedian, but he doesn't try to be funny most of the time, keeping a balance between respecting the story and injecting levity when needed. Brilliantly simple yet unique concept and executed perfectly.\n\n**5**\\. *[Welcome to Nightvale](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/)*, Bizarre, absurdist poeetry, delivered hypnotically in the form of a local radio bulletin, mixed with wonderful music for ambience and as breaks in the main show. Welcome to Nightvale is honestly pretty hard to describe. It's funny and dark and compelling and weird all at once. It's completely unique, and it's definitely not for everyone, but if it's for you, it's can be transformative.\n\n**4**\\. *[Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/)*, Musicians break down the making of their songs, pulling out and explaining individual tracks and showing you how the song works piece by piece and ultimately how they work. Lovely and unique podcast for music lovers and noobies alike. \n\n**3**\\. *[PRI's the World](http://www.pri.org/programs/the-world)*, You could argue this is the best show in podcasting and it's basically a news show, but not your typical cable news fare. Reporters go around the globe and go in depth with local topics and how they affect the world and what they mean to all of us. These are all human stories, with all the pathos and weight of great fiction, but done in interview with real people. Heavy show but very listenable in spite of the seriousness.\n\n**2**\\. *[Criminal](http://thisiscriminal.com/)*, Stories at the extremes of the human experience, told through interviews in a semi-journalistic style. Perfect blend of story-telling and introspection. Captures these wonderfully twisted stories with a matter-of-fact style that succeeds in putting you in the shoes of the  people in the stories, and make you reconsider your preconceptions about the topic. Love the pacing and music on this show as well. Perfectly produced.\n\n**1**\\. *[Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)*, Powerful stories from the past, told passionately and intelligently. Dan Carlin has a gift for the dramatic, keeping the narrative human and personal while still showing you the great sweep of history. At its heart it's just great epic storytelling, you could easily forget that it's technically learning. But then he'll make some point that makes you realize these were real people with real feelings, and these stories created the world as we live in it. This show awakened in me a totally new understanding of our world. In spite of how many podcasts I listen to, it was pretty easy to choose which one I feel is the best. Warning: very long episodes.\n\nEDIT: Formatting\n",

Nobody who's working for a magazine or website can sit around listening to podcasts all day, so their knowledge feels really shallow to those of us who have actual boring jobs. Or in my case, no life.\n",

He can be annoying at times, particularly when he's speaking so authoritatively when he only has a surface-level knowledge of a topic.  I completely understand why it was hard for you to rank his pod.\n\n**EDIT 3** - Great list, I really appreciate the effort.

Even in last week's episode Chad gave a disclaimer saying they were over-doing it in the original broadcast of a bit in the show about an FMRI machine.  \n\nUsually once RadioLab gets around to doing a show about something, other podcasts have already done the work and gone deeper. Heck, half the RL shows in the last couple years aren't even their own but are re-broadcasts of others' or updates. \n\nI'll give it thanks for basically being my entry-point to the world of produced audio story-telling.. 10 years ago...",

If you're listening to podcasts at work or doing chores, you might tune the boys out for a moment to focus on something. But in that moment, something really big can happen that will leave you wondering what you missed. \"One of six monsters is attacking you! There is no escape!!\" *Quick read of directions on a pancake recipe* \"Now you are in a new room and a minor character from before is talking to you.\"\n\nAlso listening in order was tricky for me, because the \"previously on the adventure zone...\" at the beginning wasn't really helpful. It was a mix of goofs and things that happened many episodes ago without much context. I bounced back and forth between two podcast players, so that was on me for losing my place. \n\nThe story is also sort of complex. So if you're not binging it, you'll probably forget some of the lesser characters and plot lines. \n\nJust be sure to have that 30s skip handy when the ads come one. They can last well over 5 minutes. ",

After being a fan for years I've tried to get others into it but most people think anything concerning history is just memorizing dates of things that happened to people so different that it's impossible to relate. Dan really has a way to bring out the human facets of historical events. There are legit free episodes on his site to get you started. I would recommend any of the \"Blitz\" editions to give it a try since they focus more on topic and the runtime is limited to about an hour.",

It features the blunt, and quirky, and depressing, and heartening stories in the vein of Criminal, but the prison setting is amazingly unique.\n\nIf you're a fan of consistent content and/or news, you should check out **NYT's The Daily**, and its spin off **The New Washington**. Daily on its surface is just another 'flash briefing' show, but its more like a talk show with elements from Criminal thrown in. While not every day, a few days a week they have a completely unrelated main story to the news, where they sort of do the kind of reporting that groups like 'Spotlight' does, but in audio. For example, one of my favorite episodes was on these Yazidi women captured by ISIS, who upon being rescued couldn't even stand. It basically broke me. Another nice episode was one on fake news in an Idaho town. Its basically not what you expect.\n\nNew Washington impressed me with how frank some of the guests are. Its basically interviews with senators, lawmakers, and DC power brokers. Jeff Flake's interview in particular comes to mind, where he was amazingly open and frank.\n\nIf you are a fan of hip hop, and/or like documentary styled podcasts, the limited run of **Mogul: The Life and Death of Chris Lighty** is a great listen. Lighty was the 'OG' type power broker in hip hop, managing names like Missy Eliot and 50 Cent, to name a few. While the show does lose steam towards the end, it is honest enough that you progress through the show just how the host does, feeling similar things.\n\n**Radiolab's More Perfect** is my favorite limited release show ever. It is based on cases of the US Supreme Court, and one show that gives me chills every time I hear a new episode. And best partr is, its not a law lecture. They don't cover the common 'popular' cases. Its different, yet important at the same time. For instance, they cover a case so controversial, that one Judge basically became catatonic after judgement. Or, did you know, as per the SCOTUS, it is legal to jail American citizens without due process, just because of their ethnicity? Season 2 started just this week, and its been just as great so far.\n\nBased on your tastes /u/scarscrabble, you should try at least Ear Hustle, and More Perfect. They're my favorite shows from last year.",

    "postText": "For years, I have been telling everyone I know how great Audm is. (For those who don't know, it curates articles from major magazines and they are read by professional narrators, with the text of the article scrolling as it is read.) I don't have time to read almost any magazine writing, but this app has made it possible to at least hear some of it.\n\nBut the *New York Times* bought the app and is retiring it at the end of the month, replacing it with the NYT Audio app. For me, the selection of NYT articles on Audm was hit-or-miss. Every day, I see headlines on the NYT website that sound interesting, but those rarely end up on the app. And there has been no indication that there will be much of an increase in narration of written articles.\n\nWhat I truly loved about Audm was that it drew on such a large array of magazines, such as *The New Yorker*, *Outside*, *Vanity Fair*, the *New York Review of Books*, etc. The new app is going to have a \"Magazine Stand\" feature with some non-NYT content, but the overall selection will be much smaller, and most of the magazines I just mentioned won't be part of it.\n\nIt's the end of an era.",

Curio doesn't have *The New Yorker*, *The New York Review of Books*, etc. I'll just have to hope that they either band together in a new app or each begin their own app, ideally with daily recordings of articles.",

            "comment": "I have also been an Audm evangelist for years. I initially got the app so I could stay current with the New Yorker by listening to some of the long-form articles while washing dishes or driving. I feel like I know the narrators at this point, as I\u2019ve listened to hundreds (thousands??) of hours of them speaking. Since NYT has purchased Audm to turn it into their own branded app, it seems like they\u2019ve done away with a lot of the things that made Audm so great, such as the wide variety of magazines that were narrated and the consistent use of professional narrators. \n\nI asked Audm support where I can get audio narrations of stories from magazines that are not represented in the NYT Audio app (notably, The New Yorker, the Atlantic, Vanity Fair, ProPublica, and Wired, but I\u2019m probably missing several more) and what will happen to the professional narrators who seemed to work full time for Audm, but the customer service rep gave me a total non-answer that didn\u2019t address either question. In the NYT Audio app, I\u2019ve seen that some of the articles from sources other than NYT still use the Audm narrators, so I hope they\u2019ll stick around. \n\nI like NYT and I know they\u2019re just doing what they can to survive as one of the few media companies that isn\u2019t owned by VC, and I will probably still use the NYT audio app even though it\u2019s buggy af, but I\u2019m bummed that this seems more like a takeover than a transition. Must every app be branded within an inch of its life? Anyway, definitely the end of an era.",

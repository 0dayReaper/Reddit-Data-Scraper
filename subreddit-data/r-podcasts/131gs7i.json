    "postText": "This is an amazing serial fiction  #podcast and incredibly well done by mostly volunteers\nIt's only ten episodes long, but the writing is so well done and really draws you in.\n https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yMTU1MDYyLnJzcw?ep=14\n\n\"In 2049, a group of children got stuck in space. Well, stranded in space - they're still able to move about freely. That is, barring any personal injuries, or really sticky floors or something like that.

They were totally different and yet identical in so many ways. Just an incredible stroke of luck on my part. I've been recommending them as a back-to-back experience ever since.",

I have not listened to the series, but everything I have listened to by them has been excellent.\n\n- History daily by Noiser just did a short 16 minutes episode on Lewis and Clark on March 23rd.  I know you wanted longer, but maybe this one might serve as an overview (depending on how much you already know) before listening to a longer series.",

I listened to the first 10 minutes of both and the American history tellers seemed more like a play I guess? Is that the format? It seemed like he was reenacting parts.",

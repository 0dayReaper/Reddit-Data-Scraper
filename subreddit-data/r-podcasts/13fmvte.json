    "postText": "Cult content (podcasts as well as documentaries, books, etc.) regularly includes claims about \"false memories,\" with hosts sometimes stating authoritatively that charismatic leaders can implant memories into victims. This is an unscientific claim that is not backed by evidence, so why do we keep hearing it?\n\nSomething to add to your knowledge base is the [False Memory Syndrome Foundation](http://www.fmsfonline.org/), an organization established to disseminate the idea that memories of abuse (particularly sexual abuse) are unreliable and cannot be trusted absent external corroboration.\n\nNew York magazine published an excellent [article](https://www.thecut.com/article/false-memory-syndrome-controversy.html) about the history of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation - it's worth the read. (EDIT: A comment below cited this [Nick Bryant episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deconstructing-the-deconstructed-false-memory/id1622069105?i=1000579707558), which discusses similar and related information) And here are some criticisms of the Foundation summarized on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation):\n\n&gt;**Reception and impact**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stanton states that \"Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter.\"\\[7\\] A study showed that in 1991 prior to the group's foundation, of the stories about abuse in several popular press outlets \"more than 80 percent of the coverage was weighted toward stories of survivors, with recovered memory taken for granted and questionable therapy virtually ignored\" but that three years later \"more than 80 percent of the coverage focused on false accusations, often involving supposedly false memory\" which the author of the study, Katherine Beckett, attributed to FMSF.\\[7\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;J.A. Walker claimed the FMSF reversed the gains made by feminists and victims in gaining acknowledgment of the incestuous sexual abuse of children.\\[25\\] S.J. Dallam criticized the foundation for describing itself as a scientific organization while undertaking partisan political and social activity.\\[2\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The claims made by the FMSF for the incidence and prevalence of false memories have been criticized as lacking evidence and disseminating alleged inaccurate statistics about the problem.\\[2\\] Despite claiming to offer scientific evidence for the existence of FMS, the FMSF has no criteria for one of the primary features of the proposed syndrome \u2013 how to determine whether the accusation is true or false. Most of the reports by the FMSF are anecdotal, and the studies cited to support the contention that false memories can be easily created are often based on experiments that bear little resemblance to memories of actual sexual abuse. In addition, though the FMSF claims false memories are due to dubious therapeutic practices, the organization presents no data to demonstrate these practices are widespread or form an organized treatment modality.\\[25\\]\\[26\\] Within the anecdotes used by the FMSF to support their contention that faulty therapy causes false memories, some include examples of people who recovered their memories outside of therapy.\\[2\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Astrophysicist and astrobiologist Carl Sagan cited material from a 1995 issue of the FMS Newsletter in his critique of the recovered memory claims of UFO abductees and those purporting to be victims of Satanic ritual abuse in his last book, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.\\[27\\]\n\nThe foundation dissolved in 2019 because, according to its website, \"people with concerns about false memories can communicate with others electronically.\"\n\nConsidering the foundation's central ideas are now popping up in all these other forms of communication, maybe \"dissolved\" isn't quite the right word . . . \"mutated\" might be more appropriate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** u/vardypartykodi permanently banned me from r/cultpodcasts for this this post because:\n\n* *This is not cult-podcast related. It also appears the user cross-posted it to 600+ subreddits. I am banning the user*\n\n(I crossposted to r/cults, r/cultpodcasts, and r/podcasts) The ban occurred after talking quite a bit with u/Cult-Vault, who recently interviewed Jennings Brown.\n\nI'm getting quite a bit of interaction with people promoting the false memory narrative on r/cults, but then the users delete all of their comments and/or block me. It also seems that some of my comments are disappearing (?), one of which referenced a concern with [Julia Shaw](https://www.drjuliashaw.com/) glorifying Elizabeth Loftus on her podcast episode \"[Remembering Monsters](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08ndywt).\" (The episode title references Richard Ofshe's book \"Making Monsters,\" and both Loftus and Ofshe were [False Memory Syndrome Foundation advisory board ](http://www.fmsfonline.org/?about=AdvisoryBoardProfiles)[members](http://www.fmsfonline.org/?about=AdvisoryBoardProfiles).)\n\nInterestingly, a commenter later linked a [2019 article from Loftus and colleagues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826861/) that cites Shaw's study and states the results deserve scrutiny:\n\n&gt;Shaw and Porter (2015) found that 70% (n = 21) of participants formed false memories of committing a crime (but see Wade, Garry, &amp; Pezdek, 2018, who used another scoring method and reported that only 26% to 30% of Shaw and Porter\u2019s subjects formed false memories).\n\nIf you read the Loftus article and need to balance it, here's [one paper that takes a different perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5248650/). Note that the authors describe issues in the peer review process, with vicious respondents in the reviewer pool. The authors' conclusion states:\n\n&gt;In order to avoid the possibility that data which contradict reviewers' assumptions are suppressed, it has been recommended that all articles and reviews be published, separating the review process from the publication decision. Our experience suggests that in some controversial areas, this approach is necessary and that journal editors often fail to challenge or correct a flawed review process. We therefore applaud the editors of Applied Cognitive Psychology for making our data and arguments available and encouraging a wider debate. The views of Nosek and Bar\u2010Anan (2012) appear to be particularly relevant to the study of false memories: \u2018Truth emerges as a consequence of public scrutiny\u2014some ideas survive, others die. Thus, science makes progress through the open, free exchange of ideas and evidence\u2019 (p. 217).\n\nI'm taking all the downvoting of my post on (especially on r/cults), false memory narrative promotion in the comments, and user disappearance/ blocking as a sign that this weird dynamic is worth some attention, as it suggests that someone has skin in the game.\n\nPlease do continue to link to any other podcast content that discusses false memory, from any perspective (and please be specific about which episode, because I unfortunately don't have time to listen to everything). Thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So while there might be some validity to the concept, it sounds like this \"foundation\" is pushing an agenda by using misinterpreted data and baseless supposition. Really interesting concept and if it hasn't been explored in detail, it would make a really good topic for a podcast! \nThis is going to be my next ADHD research deep dive so thanks for that!\n\nEditing to add after a very quick scan of the website you linked: In light of the huge number of \"parental unification\" industry that seems to cross over from judicial, social services, and private companies that offer \"unification services\" that basically intend to convince children that they are lying about the abuse they have endured with the goal of forcing children to reunify with their abusers, this false memory thing takes on a far more insidious, dark, and destructive.",

                    "comment": "I would argue that the Mandela Effect is not akin to false memory because it usually deals with a small detail of a thing that is not personally relevant (e.g., remembering a different version of a peanut butter label). The Mandela Effect may also be attributed in some cases (I have no examples of this) of the public being exposed to the incorrect version of a thing through some other avenue (e.g., a popular magazine spells something wrong, a large part of the population sees it, and the wrong spelling mixes with the right spelling in memory) and the incorrect version gets perpetuated.\n\nI think the parental unification idea is worth exploring. My personal guess (just a hypothesis) is that this dynamic is focused on shifting responsibility and liability. There seems to be an interest in convincing the public of things like false memory (which erodes victims' rights) and pseudo-magical abilities of cult leaders to control followers (which removes accountability from followers) as well as an interest in establishing legal precedent for trying and convicting people labeled \"cult leaders.\" While on its face this may seem altruistic, it becomes more \"insidious, dark, and destructive\" when you consider the possibility that the blame for all bad acts committed within a group may be shifted to a single individual defined as the \"cult leader,\" even in cases where followers chose to engage in bad acts for an extended period of time and/or received some sort of benefit from committing bad acts.",

The cult leader might create a fertile and insular environment where antisocial behaviours are normalised so the behaviours of individuals within the group are acceptable until the group is disbanded and subject to the wider societal value norms. As well, cults target and are appealing to people with a certain profile: vulnerable, history of victimisation, high surface level empathy and narcissism, low critical thinking, etc. All of which makes them more susceptible to influence.\nI am talking out of my ass, honestly, since this is the first time I've really been exposed to this concept but I'm invested now.",

Because in instances of herd mentality, we assume that individuals still have access to their full judgment and decision-making capacities, but for whatever reason they choose to stop using them.\n\nIn contrast, cult content creators (and cult scholars, cult experts, etc.) are promoting the argument that cult followers lose access to their judgment and decision-making, and are totally overtaken, particularly by the leader.\n\nSo far, it's not clear what separates a situation of herd mentality from a situation defined as a \"cult,\" and as far as I can tell cult content creators don't have the evidence to show that there is a difference (probably because there isn't a difference).\n\n&gt;As well, cults target and are appealing to people with a certain profile: vulnerable, history of victimisation, high surface level empathy and narcissism, low critical thinking, etc.\n\nCult scholars/ content creators specifically argue against this! They usually say anyone is susceptible, but of course they don't have evidence to support their claim.",

With few exceptions, people who fit cluster b were able to identify and categorise other people (ideal targets, threats, people like them) from short videos. For supply, they were able to identify them with an impressive accuracy from photographs.\nIf we assume that cult leaders are cluster b (and a lot of them are dark triad), it follows that they are able to screen for ideal candidates and screen against threats and rivals during the love bombing conversations that always happen (for this explicit purpose).\nPeople don't lose their ability to reason in these situations, but they are operating in survival mode because the gaslighting, yardsticking, and constant paradigm shifts create so much instability and anxiety you just don't have time to think things through. As well, these constructs are self reinforcing with other members policing and pulling people back into it.\nIt's no different than a toxic corporate culture or household. The only difference is what is normalised and the fact that external influences have been erased.",

            "comment": "So many reasons. Well laid out by other comments here. \n\nI think another big overall reason is that podcasts have essentially 0 discoverability on the podcast players and depend on RSS. By not having an algorithm like YouTube \u201cyou might like this\u201d recommendations really hurts the discoverability for podcasts. The only podcast on Spotify or Apple that we see are the 1% of podcasters or new ones by celebrities, shows that have been bought by Spotify, or giant studios. \n\nInstead of host and podcast creators spending time researching or becoming a great audio engineer, you have to spend time marketing and reaching out. Which is great! If you know that you should focus on building a community (for lack of a better word) rather than just spamming your podcast link on social media. But most people don\u2019t see that. They have a story or a subject that they want to share and not being a pseudo social media expert becomes an issue in the growth of their shows. \n\nThe RSS hosts that you upload to also shove analytics on the dashboard of website so it becomes a numbers game to a big degree. \n\nSo if you\u2019re a beginning creator you have way too many hats to wear, without income, and having to stretch yourself thin on several specialty positions necessary to make your show successful.  \n\nYou\u2019re a host, an audio engineer, a social media marketer, SEO specialist, a graphic designer, a producer, a writer, so on. You can split duties if you have a co-host or maybe some friends to help but without capital or recurring income, it becomes a very time intensive thing with little upside. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some YouTubers with small channels (70-100K subs)who have their podcast hit only 100-300 plays an episode. Can\u2019t get ad money that way. \n\nWhile burnout, lack of content ideas, stories being fully told, or even just plain old life taking their interests elsewhere, discoverability for Podcasts is a major issue that doesn\u2019t seem to have a clear answer. \n\nI love the \u201cIf books could kill\u201d  \u201cmaintenance phase\u201d podcasts but I NEVER would have found them if it wasn\u2019t for this subreddit. \n\nAlso if any podcasters are reading this for the love of god please remember to take breaks! \n\nI love seeing audience listeners chiming in about shows going dark out of nowhere without word and that is an issue, but there\u2019s a lot of shame tied to being a creator and giving up on something you worked hard at. I\u2019m guilty of it.  I had a top 10% most listened to show (ain\u2019t much lol) and once my co-host quit I didn\u2019t say a word. The shame of the perceived failure made wanting to admit defeat an impossibility. \n\nAnyways, apologies for the over explanation. Hope this gives a different side of the conversation.",

Between getting everything ready for that the podcast fell to the wayside and they never found the time to figure the pod back out, much less finding time to record now that they were in different time zones. \n\nI was disappointed but glad to hear that everything was alright.

At first we talked about all kinds of movies but after we started doing the podcast we found it was more fun to watch these obscure straight to streaming movies and joke around about them. We still do good/new movies when they are relevant. This weeks episode will be The Little Mermaid. Is our podcast popular? Not by a long shot. Is it growing? Yes.",

He had been uploading every day without fail for years. The last month of his uploads his demeanour changes as he tells the listener that he and his partner are fighting heavily. He ends up booking a hotel and in his last ep he is recording in the hotel saying he will speak to us tomorrow as he always done. Then poof, no new ep or anything. Just gone. Happened a couple of months ago and I check every morning to see if he uploads but nothing. I\u2019ve messaged him heaps but have got no reply. Super bummed.",

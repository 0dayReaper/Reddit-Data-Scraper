    "postText": "Missing mom Suzanne Morphew's daughters and husband Barry have broken their silence three years after she vanished and murder charges were dropped against him.  \r  \n\r  \nBarry Morphew, 55, was charged in May 2021 with murder of his wife Suzanne, who vanished while out on a bike ride in Salida on Mother's Day 2020. Her body has never been found. \r  \n\r  \nLast year, prosecutors dropped all charges against Morphew after a judge sanctioned the district attorney's office for discovery violations.\r  \n\r  \nNow, he and his daughters have spoken out about the ordeal - and how Suzanne had made 'bad decisions' because she was struggling with drugs and chemotherapy while battling Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r  \n\r  \nBarry Morphew sits with his daughters Mallory (right) and Macy (left)  as they break their silence following the disappearance of their mom and murder charges being dropped against the dad\r  \nBarry Morphew sits with his daughters Mallory (right) and Macy (left)  as they break their silence following the disappearance of their mom and murder charges being dropped against the dad\r  \n\r  \nBarry Morphew, 55, the husband of Suzanne Morphew, has filed a civil rights lawsuit seeking $15M claiming he was wrongfully charged with Colorado mom's disappearance and murder\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWhen asked how the ordeal has left them, daughters Mallory and Macy told ABC: 'Very very sad. Very confusion.'\r  \n\r  \n'So traumatic. Literally our worst nightmare.' \r  \n\r  \nWhen asked if he had anything to do with the disappearance of his wife, Barry said: 'Absolutely not. It's very hurtful to lose your reputation and your integrity.'\r  \n\r  \nAs they were asked if they ever questioned if their dad was not innocent, Mallory and Macy said: 'I've never had a shred of doubt.'\r  \n\r  \n'Not one.' \r  \n\r  \nSpeaking about the prosecutors, Barry continued: 'They're wrong. They've got tunnel vision. They looked at one person and they've got too much pride to say they're wrong and look somewhere else.'\r  \n\r  \nWhen asked about Suzanne, he said: 'We had a wonderful life, a wonderful marriage. She was just so loving and giving, and such a good mother. I know that she was going through chemotherapy for the last couple years before her disappearance.\r  \n\r  \n'She was really having trouble with the chemotherapy and the drugs.\r  \n\r  \n'I know she was going through some hard things and made some bad decisions.'\r  \n\r  \nBarry said that his heart was 'broken' when he found out his wife was having an affair.\r  \n\r  \nHe said: 'My heart was broke. My heart was broken. I didn't believe it.'\r  \n\r  \nBarry Morphew with his two daughters on April 19 2022, after murder charges against him were dropped\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMorphew was charged with his wife's murder in 2021 - but the charges have since been dropped\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMorphew was arrested in May 2021, a year after Suzanne disappeared, and charged with her murder \u00bf despite police not having found a body\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBarry Morphew arrives at court in Salida, CO for a hearing ahead of his murder trial.Barry was flanked by his daughters Macy (all black) and Malorie as he walked into court\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe area where police think Suzanne's body may be is thought to be near the abandoned mine that was previously searched. Police say they are waiting for the snow in the area to melt before they can excavate it\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWhen asked what the hardest part has been, her daughter simply said: 'Just not having mom.' \r  \n\r  \nThis comes after Morphew filed a $15million federal civil rights lawsuit against more than 20 prosecutors and law enforcement officials for 'irreparably' tarnishing his 'name and reputation' with a 'conspiracy to violate his state and federal constitutional rights.' \r  \n\r  \nThe 185-page complaint claims that the authorities conspired to wrongly arrest Morphew, that they fabricated evidence, concealed exculpatory evidence and conducted a reckless investigation, all which led to Morphew being wrongly prosecuted.\r  \n\r  \n'As result of the Defendants' conduct Barry was charged, arrested, and prosecuted, and his property seized, for a crime he did not commit,' the lawsuit says.\r  \n\r  \n'As result of the Defendants' conduct Barry spent five months in jail, approximately 6 more months wearing a GPS ankle monitor with severe restrictions on his movement, and almost a year defending against the criminal charges. To this date, Barry's property remains in the CCSD's possession.'\r  \n\r  \nThe lawsuit claims that Morphew's 'name and reputation has been irreparably tarnished in Colorado and all around the country.'\r  \n\r  \nThose named in the lawsuit including Chaffee County, the sheriff's office and board of commissioners, 11th Judicial District Attorney Linda Stanley and her staff, and Colorado Bureau of Investigation and FBI agents.",

They did a great video that covered several different missing person cases and Suzanne Morphew was one of them. They also did a follow up episode about Barry Morphew.",

    "postText": "i like the JRE, in the variety of guests and conversational feel of it (i don\u2019t like interview style podcasts). My favorite shows of his are ones with duncan trussel, hancock and randall, and any scientists, drug, alien or conspiracy related ones. Unfortunately these days those seem to be less and less frequent. I really don\u2019t care for his comedian guests, MMA, military or hunting guests. \n\nCan anyone recommend similar podcasts but without the above? I\u2019m aware of duncan\u2019s podcasts and joe rogan affiliated  people. But looking for pods outside the JRR bubble. Thanks :)",

Armchair expert was my favorite she went on. They seem to alternate between actor and journalist/scientist.",

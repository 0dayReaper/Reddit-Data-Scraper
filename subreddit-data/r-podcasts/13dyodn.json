    "postText": "Hi guys I really need your help. Maybe someone knows the podcast I am talking about.\n\nIt is a podcast narrated by a guy (I think he is a professional author) He started to be interested in a guy's life and slowly found out more about him. It is a one season podcast.\n\nThe man he's talking about has already died and was at some point in his life married to a Hollywood star (can't remember her name either). Added to this is that the man was somehow related (think it was the son) of the guy who flew the hijacked plane to Cuba and was greeted then and there by Castro.\n\nFurthermore the narrator draws parallels to his own life with his family and the old man's life. \n\nAs you see my recollection of memory is kinda small. I would loove to listen to it again. So if anyone by chance knows what I am talking about.. I'd be super grateful\n\nThanks in advance",

Luckily it was still on my Spotify list. \n\nMaybe gonna listen again too. Suddenly plants and a garden center pop in my mind... not sure if that's also in this podcast.",

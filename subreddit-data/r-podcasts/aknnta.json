Their D&amp;D campaign is focusing mostly on Curse of Strahd. They're currently playing through Two Headed Serpent in CoC. \n\n[Godsfall](https://www.godsfall.com/#) - This one is based out of Chicago. Aram created the Godsfall universe from the ground up to be used with D&amp;D rules. I was actually introduced to Godsfall through a guest appearance of Aram and one of his players, Doug, in a few How we Roll episodes. Another great series to listen to. \n\n[Tales of Nowhere](https://www.talesofnowhere.com/) - This one is pretty neat. They each created a character from whatever tabletop game they wanted, and then they were each teleported to an interdimensional diner where a mad scientist had set up shop. They've since jumped between multiple different games, adopting the rules of whatever game they happen to be in. The goal is to help the mad scientist close the rifts between all of these \"dimensions\" and get each one of them back to their home world. \n\n[Pretending to be People](https://open.spotify.com/show/223qX1EhZ0dyBuFNRzhckT?si=zTjMaG6ZTmyQ-9jvs1JSLg) - This one is based out of the US and is pretty new. There's only a few episodes, but it's been very entertaining. Also CoC. ",

It is serialised as a monthly podcast and includes songs and animation along the way too.\n\nSeries set up - Recently widowed Neil Sparks has a dead-end office job in a travel agency and lives alone with his 26 year old unemployable son Dorian who spends all his days working on the debut album which he thinks will make him famous. Realising that his son\u2019s band has reignited memories of his own forgotten dreams of becoming a successful musician, Neil comes up with a deal: Dorian can use his mother\u2019s savings to try and make it over the next six months after which he has to get a proper job. There is only one other condition: Neil has to be the manager, and what he says goes!\n\nwww.goldenearspodcast.com",

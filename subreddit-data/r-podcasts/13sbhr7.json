Keep em coming!\n\nHi all, I'm burnt out on true crime and I see Normal Gossip recommended a lot and it has amazing reviews. I have tried listening to a couple episodes and I'm having a hard time getting into it. It feels like trying to jump on a moving train.\n\nShould I start at the beginning or do you have a favorite episode to recommend?",

I probably would have never continued had I started at the newest episodes. I feel like it\u2019s dragged out and not that funny. I\u2019d start from the first episode and try that!!!",

People have been commenting quite a bit over the insane intro times we\u2019ve been getting. One was nearly 20 minutes of a comedian waxing poetic about how gossip is good in the same exact words every guest before them has used. Exhausting. Really disappointed in the current season, I haven\u2019t been able to finish a single episode.",

My favorite episodes are Spot the Scammer about a girl\u2019s trip that goes very wrong, Steampunk-Ass Murder Mystery about a very niche pocket watch internet community, and the Not-Quite Magicians about a magician troupe with a terrible boss. \n\nBut also, if you don\u2019t like it then that\u2019s fine!! Plenty of other good podcasts out there :)",

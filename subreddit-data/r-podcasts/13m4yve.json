( I want to read as many religious texts as possible over the next few years but I'm starting with the Bible because I was raised in that religion) \nI don't care if it's done by an atheist, Christian or other but one that really studies the text. \nI've heard super evangelicals do it and aithests do it for the sake of poking fun but I'm looking for a podcast or even an online class that goes over it as more of a piece of history and work of literature and philosophy.",

But it's a lot more fun than my description made it sound! The only drawback is they post irregularly.",

Also has episodes on Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, manicheanism, and other religions/philosophies bouncing around the area when Christianity and modern Judaism were forming.    This is exactly what you are looking for:  a thoughtful, sincere discussion of the texts and the historical context in which they were produced as well as an analysis of the possible authors of the texts. Plus, the host is an incredibly talented presenter. This is a gem of a podcast.  After listening to the Bible episodes I don\u2019t see how you could resist listening to all the rest of the episodes!",

    "postText": "(Spotify links)\n\n1. [**This Little Light**](https://open.spotify.com/show/1saWgF0vjKyP9Izwi1QYBV?si=4c6f0ef0674e4e33): Flea's podcast, focusing on the art of music education, craft of performing music and getting inspired, featuring great names like Rick Rubin, Thundercat, Margo price, Finneas and Patti Smith among many others. Pretty new show\n2. [**Popcast**](https://open.spotify.com/show/3ugDIELXIU7erW5Xp49tWp?si=b5144f1603434ec5): New York Times podcast hosted by Joe Caramanica, discussing, reviewing and criticizing a wide span of music industry topics. How trends evolve, the influence of particular records, dissecting new music...\n3. [**Broken Record**](https://open.spotify.com/show/6UsuhRMTD9O71DznRP8540?si=b535a85af5734bed): Nothing more amusing than to hear Rick Rubin speaking with some of the most influential, incredible artists out there, both from our new times, and legacy artists. I very much recommend listening to all the episodes of the Broken Records podcast, great guests and very inspirational from a musical and showbiz industry point of view.\n4. [**Waterproof Records with Jacob Givens**](https://open.spotify.com/show/4HaqCMURucXqyOofBy1oVa?si=413dda7e082d49f4): If you love the 90's aesthetics, the grunge, the alternative era, you'll love this podcast. I came across Jacob on his Tiktok channel, where he would post nostalgia of 90's music releases and how they felt when you would hear them for the first time. This podcast focuses on specific albums that played an important in a lot of people's lives. He's relatively new in the podcast business and is pretty up-and-coming. His socials have been growing pretty well lately. You should check out and support this guy's stuff, very passionate!",

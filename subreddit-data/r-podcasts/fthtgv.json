Users don't utilize the recommendation threads and the subreddit is filled with posts asking for recommendations.\n\n\n2. Despite having more than a million subscribers, posts don't get engagement. Seriously, I've seen subreddits with less than 50,000 subscribers that have posts with more upvotes/comments and just overall more engagement with posts.\n\n\n\n3. Mods don't seem to care much about the subreddit and don't interact with the users.\n\n\n4. There are no discussion threads about the podcasting environment and no weekly activities which would have helped the subreddit.\n\n\nThe list goes on and on. It really makes me sad thinking about the state of the subreddit.\nEven though I criticize the Mods, I realize that maintaining a subreddit with over a million subscribers is a tough job and I respect them for taking up that tough job. But I also think that this subreddit has potential to become better and I hope that it does become better.",

This happens with a lot of medium sized subreddits where an echo effect kind of happens. A single post each day is basically the one that \"makes it\" and most others will have 1-30 upvotes.",

I understand that you guys don't get much time. But the state of the sub right now is ~~pathetic~~ pretty bad, surely something could be done. Also, I'm sorry If I sound rude, I don't mean to but the problem of time allocation is surely not particular to you guys, it's the same with the mods of other subreddits too, but still those subreddits are doing better than us.\n\n4.

I come here for reviews by other listeners, not to sort through 1000 crappy pitches for 1000 crappy shows. There are a *lot* of crappy podcasts out there, and I think you're underestimating how bad the spammy ad posts would get without strict control. A post by a creator also tells me little to nothing about how the show will be - of course you love the show if you've put hours of effort into it. Reviews by other users with no obvious bias are much more helpful.\n\nI agree that there could be improvements in this sub (there could always be improvements to any sub), but this is not one of them.",

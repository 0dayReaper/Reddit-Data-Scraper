I really don\u2019t know why. But I was wondering if anyone else is turning away from true crime and into other genres of podcasts?",

Idk you just know going into it that it's not going to be anything positive or even really interesting. Just things that you couldn't possible fathom doing. Plus, at one point, really over the course of a few years, I had a lot of interactions with police and getting arrested due to drug addiction and my dealings with them left me not wanting to watch anything that contained them. I have listened to couple recently, but have no desire to go back down that genre path. I get it, my friend.\n\nEdit: spelling",

And then we'll either tell you how there were these *warning signs* that are usually just social awkwardness or a flat affect, or that everyone thought they were so lovely and no one could have seen it coming. Nothing can prevent them turning out this way, nothing can fix them, they're monsters, superpredators,, not even human, and they need to die. Are they common? More than you think! How can you spot them? You probably can't, but be wary of everyone who seems a bit odd, just in case! How did they turn out this way and what's their thought processes and inner life like? Who knows and who cares! Now let me rigorously describe in meticulous detail the brutal murder of a child/sex worker!\"\n\nNot only is it sensationalist, it's facile. It's regurgitating official reports with some editorializing to make it into a narrative, with no effort put into understanding the psychology or the bigger picture. Talking about perpetrators this way is not useful, and it's not clever, it's shallow, and it doesn't teach you anything you can't pick up by watching The Human Centipede.\n\n(hopefully unnecessary caveat: I understand that there are exceptions. #notallTC)",

Except for the ocassional episode of This Is Why We Drink and Swindled (more focused on corporate crime), I hardly touch the stuff anymore. I listen to Strictly Stalking as a victim of stalking, as hearing other people's experiences directly has been comforting, and the show is 90% survivor statements.\n\nParticularly after the George Floyd uprising -- it felt trite to listen to (generally) white cis women discuss true crime, even with disclaimers, even with jokes about incompetent law enforcement, or shouts of ACAB. The fact is that most hosts of these shows are far removed from the social situations and classes most impacted by what they discuss. \n\nI have friends convinced they're going to be trafficked in a Target parking lot who are so anxious and afraid of their own potential victimization as middle class white women in their mid-20s that they don't even think about who is actually targeted and impacted the most, and that most trafficking is not random, it is someone you or your family knows. I don't know, sometimes it feels like a validation tool for how victimized white women (in particular) are, when oppression is intersectional and they face fewer barriers than most in many aspects of society. But that's just my perspective as a white AFAB nonbinary person who was a woman for most of my life. \n\nSorry for the ramble. I've been thinking about this for awhile. Anyways, I mostly listen to Cool Zone Media shows now, and got back into audio fiction. I'm much more happy, and find listened to news/politics shows like It Could Happen Here more constructive than listening to true crime.\n\nEdit: OP, if you want educational, check out Ologies!

I ended up doing a fair amount of due diligence to find podcasts that were POC led so I wouldn't have to listen to another white podcaster talk about how they read  White Fragility for the first time and it was transformational. And then of course never follow up with any other book from a POC author.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But that's just my perspective as a white AFAB nonbinary person who was a woman for most of my life.\n\nLol. yeah.

But today would probably call the cops on a guy hanging out by their porch for a minute too long if they felt threatened.

            "comment": "I've tried to avoid the genre as much as possible, despite several women I know trying to lure me into the cult of the Murderino. Some people I know see true crime as self-defense though knowledge, but it's very apparent to me that constantly digesting this kind of content for years has done bad things for my friends' mental health. I also worry about how the lives of people connected to the victims are affected by the legions of amatuer slueths out there trying to crack cold cases. Y'all have fun, but I prefer to live my life ignorant of the rapists and serial killers on hunting sprees all around me.",

It used to be co-hosted by Michael Hobbes and Sarah Marshall (Michael has left since) and has a similar premise to MP. The podcast covers events and people that are falsely recalled by the masses. Some episodes cover TC, but do not focus on the gruesome details of it all. They tend instead to try to empathize with everyone without excusing anything that went on.",

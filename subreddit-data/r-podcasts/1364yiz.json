Like a war for dummies podcast.\n\nI\u2019m looking for ones on \n\nWW1\n\nWW2\n\nCold War\n\nWar of 1812\n\n Vietnam war\n\nKorean war \n\nGulf war\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on podcasts or specific episode regarding the above and similar events, that would be awesome.",

Also if you haven't already I seriously suggest the history of Rome. Plenty of wars in there. Only reason I bring it up is because I used to be interested in specific wars like you, found the history of Rome podcast and it changed my life. Now I'm a huge roman history buff.",

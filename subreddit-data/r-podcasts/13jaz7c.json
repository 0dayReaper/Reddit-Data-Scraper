Everyone thought she was weird/annoying and basically ignored her or made fun of her behind her back. Spent most of her time with 3 people. I felt badly for her because she never did anything per say to deserve being dismissed the way she was in HS, so i\u2019d always make an effort to acknowledge her when we crossed paths. I didn\u2019t try to be anything beyond cordial and kind at surface level because something about her was just\u2026off? Major golden retriever vibes that felt strange. Had zero desire to go beyond small talk. \n\nI figured she would have a similar social experience in college. But I guess it was an opportunity to start fresh? \n\nI didn\u2019t even realize the podcast was about her until they mentioned our hometown and I googled. We weren\u2019t good friends so she wasn\u2019t top of mind, so was floored when I started listening and made the connection. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re like me and also remember her by her maiden name. Her IG and FB posts were so sad to read. Really wonder how she pulled the photos off. \n\nUnbelievable she turned out to be such a scummy, vile human. I guess everyone\u2019s instinct was correct. She IS off.",

Because I feel like she's getting all the blame but I have so many questions about a man who essentially leaves his wife for the babysitter/tutor who is twelve years younger than him. I HATE her and feel like she's definitely a sociopath but I do wonder if he was grooming her as well. Plus his own damn daughter survived leukemia and he signs on to let said ex-babysitter/wife fake all of this? There's something doubly sick about that. \n\nI actually AM a Hodgkins Survivor - I was diagnosed when I was 19 and in treatment for two years. I'm 48 years old now (I've long outlived my expiry date, statistically\ud83d\ude02) but if anyone has any questions, I'll answer them the best I can. Though treatment and everything has changed and part of my treatment was an experimental radiation trial so my experience would probably be vastly different than someone who was treated ten years ago. \n\nAs a Hodgkins Survivor, this gave me a lot of anger. While Hodgkins isn't terribly rare, it's not one you hear a lot about. Usually when I tell people I had cancer, I have to explain what it is, etc etc etc. The fact that this is probably the most a lot of people will ever hear about the disease is nauseating. If karma is a thing, I hope Honeygirl loses her salivary glands, thyroid gland, develops Reynaud's syndrome, and has to deal with all the joy of living in a body with a severely damaged lymphatic/immune system. (It makes even getting a splinter a whole lot more exciting, trust me).  I'm not crappy enough to wish cancer on anyone but the annoying life long side effects of prolonged treatment? Yes, I am petty enough to wish those on her.",

                            "comment": "I had both ABVD and MOPP chemo - after and during chemo I wasn't warned about it causing future infertility, just told to be on birth control to prevent pregnancy during treatment (remember, I was 19 at the time). In one of the blog entries read on the podcast, Amanda mentioned something about one of those drugs affecting fertility (I forget which one) but again, was nothing I heard.\n\nThat said, the reason I did both chemos is because they weren't working on me. So I went to an experimental radiation trial hoping for a hail mary pass (which I got). That was two treatments a day for five months, five days a week. It was A LOT. Prior to starting that, I was advised that kids were out in the future due to taking that much radiation, possible effects on my reproduction organs and potential side effects on any kids (I was basically Chernobyl on legs for a while there). This wasn't a big deal for me as A) I had never, ever wanted kids and knew I planned on never having any since I was a kid and B) I had a bifurcated uterus to begin with. I was also advised that I was at incredibly high risk for a relapse within 5 years and there were no statistics on survival after ten years (it was a new treatment protocol and the idea at the time was more buying time and hoping for the best).  Luckily, neither of these things happened - I neither relapsed and over 25 years later, here I still am. So that worked out. \n\nHowever I know due to where I had a lot of the radiation (in my chest area) my breast cancer chances are crazy. As a result, I've had yearly mammograms since I was 20. And as much as someone can know their end, I kinda know it will catch me in the end. Hopefully not for a lot more years. But no, aside from the warnings from the huge amount of radiation that cookin' a babe in Chernobyl womb was a terrible idea, the cancer didn't effect my fertility. I still had to use birth control for most of my life. The concern was more for my ability to carry the child to term and for it to not have terrible side effects from the damage to my body and any leftover radiation.",

(I unfortunately knew her in college) and there were posts about going to nyc for treatment, meeting all sorts of d list celebrities, some country singers, talking about her 'bonus' daughter, describing on her posts that her insurance met a cap, or her experimental drug or trial treatments weren't covered and would have to travel to New York for it, and that's how she would ask for donations cause it made you feel so sorry for her, list goes on...even to the end where one of her last posts talked about how sick and disgusting people are cause someone accused her of faking and was seeking legal counsel to sue them. (I have a memory of an elephant and a photographic memory).  Oooh, my favorite and it was cringey, she had made a music video of her holding signs saying, 'Team Amanda' to \"Fight Song\" by Rachel Platten with clips of her family and her \"treatments\". Cringe factor 11/10, eat my ass.",

Almost like anyone suggesting he must\u2019ve known is victim blaming. I thought it was bullshit.\n\nI\u2019d agree under different circumstances. But he repeatedly used his wife\u2019s alleged illness and medical costs to avoid child support, file for tax breaks, etc., while claiming to have attended all of her chemo, over the course of SEVEN YEARS. Comparing him to some poor dude who was scammed for 6 mos by a gf\u2019s fake pregnancy is comparing apples and oranges.\n\nThe husband was complicit. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to pull it off without him. \n\n[Their YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2ELrqLxJk)",

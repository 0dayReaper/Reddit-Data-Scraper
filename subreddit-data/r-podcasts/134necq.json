What I mean by that is that Im looking for podcasts that are, in a way, similar to radio plays (broadcasting) - using background sounds, atmospheres, music, noises, etc. regardless of genre. \n\nAlso if you have any tips on books or articles about these topics, I would highly appreciate it!\n\nThanks a lot in advance!! :))",

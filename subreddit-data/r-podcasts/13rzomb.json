    "postText": "I used to love relationship/dating podcasts but I feel as if the topics/talking points are unproductive. They always center around \u201cwhat you\u2019re doing wrong\u201d or \u201chow to be more feminine to attract the man on your dreams\u201d. I\u2019m looking for something a little more balanced - someone who acknowledges romance is a desire for many but it doesn\u2019t have to be all consuming and there are different ways to cultivate love and community. Any suggestions?",

You might want to check out Solo, it\u2019s pretty good and he talks about this stuff. Also perhaps search for intentional communities. I don\u2019t have any specific recommendations but I did like a few series on Utopias - Nice Try and Benjamen Walkers Theory of Everything.",

            "comment": "**Doing It! with Hannah Witton** - Hannah Witton and her guests discuss relationships, sex, sexual health and more. You might like:\n\n* How to be Good at Dating with Shan Boody  \n* Consent Culture and Intentional Relationships with Dr Meg-John Barker  \n* Being Single, Dating and Setting Boundaries with Michelle Elman  \n* Sexual Desire and the Three Times a Week Myth with Dr Karen Gurney  \n\n**Sounds Fake But Okay** - an aromantic asexual girl and biromantic demisexual girl talk love, relationships, sexuality and more. It might seem strange to listen to an ace podcast if you're not ace, but hear me out - who better to explain dating and relationships than people who aren't as fixated on them as everyone else. Some episodes to start with:\n\n* Ep 2: Romantic vs. Platonic Relationships  \n* Ep 173: Pre-Date Rituals\n\n**Girls Who Read Porn** - an Aussie and two Kiwis discuss romance books. Very light-hearted and fun. No need to have read the books.",

Basically goes into how the TV show COPS affected our culture, and gave people the wrong idea of what Police do, ultimately attracting wannabe warrior/heroes to policing. \n\nI love all the headlong podcasts, and this one was exceptionally good.\n\nPocketcasts: [https://pca.st/qa0e](https://pca.st/qa0e)\n\niTunes: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/headlong-running-from-cops/id1459118695](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/headlong-running-from-cops/id1459118695)",

Which leads to a generation of cops who grew up watching the TV show thinking that that ginned up facade is how they're supposed to act normally.\n\nAlso the show pretty much presents the cops as 100% right. If a cop sees some detritus on the bottom of a guys car and says \"yup, that's weed\", we viewers at home don't get to see if it actually is or not. We don't see the follow up lab tests or anything like that. So we never know when actually the cops are flat out wrong",

So many shows do filler episodes just for the ad revenue. Solid, 100% recommend this one.",

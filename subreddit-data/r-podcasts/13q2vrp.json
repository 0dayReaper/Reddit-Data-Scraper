    "postText": "Hey! I've been Internet sleuthing and can't find the answer so thought I'd ask the professionals.\nI listened to a podcast circa 2017-2019 that was a fictional comedy paranormal theme. It took place in a gas station. Protagonist was a non chalant employee, paranormal things happened all the time and he didn't gaf. That's all I got. I just know I liked it and wanna relisten.\nAround that time I listened to real ghost stories online, alice isn't dead, and I think I tried night Vale but didn't get into it. Used cast box.\nCan anyone help? Tia.",

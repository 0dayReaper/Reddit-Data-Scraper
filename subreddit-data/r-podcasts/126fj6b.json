I like paranormal, mysterious, history type stuff so I think we're on the same page.\n\nHere's my list:\n\nThe Mystery of Life\n\nThe Dollop\n\nProject Skeptic\n\nThe Cryptonaut Podcast\n\nOur Strange Skies\n\nBlurry Photos\n\nLions Led By Donkeys\n\nDesert Oracle\n\nTrillbilliy Worker's Party\n\nThe Dark Histories Podcast\n\nMr.Bunker's Conspiracy Time Podcast\n\nOur Fake History\n\nHistorical Blindness\n\nKnifepoint Horror\n\nExpanded Perspective\n\nConspiracy Class\n\nthe Bible and Beyond\n\nArt Bell Back in Time",

                            "comment": "It rotates honestly. Mostly what I look for are hosts that are engaging enough to keep my attention while I fall asleep. No loud intros or effects, no commercials in the middle (front and back are fine). \n\nEverything on that list has been at least top 3 at one point or another...\n\n\nThe Mystery of Life - Currently one of my favorites. Dude is a skeptic, his wife is really into the paranormal. Great dynamic, zero commercials and no pre-amble.\n\nThe Dollop - Tons of commercials up front, skip to about 10 min and you'll miss most. I also love that they shout the date as they're starting so it's hard to miss and from then on, no commercials. They're hilarious, 2 comedians talking about crazy shit in history. \n\nProject Skeptic\n\nThe Cryptonaut Podcast\n\nOur Strange Skies\n\nBlurry Photos - This one is great because it'll tell you right in the write up where the research begins so you can fast forward to the meat.\n\nLions Led By Donkeys - A little dry, they dissect military events where the commander messed up, hosts are military.\n\nDesert Oracle - Dude has the best voice to fall asleep to.\n\nTrillbilliy Worker's Party - This one is just weird. No commercials, it's random as hell and they're pretty funny. \n\nThe Dark Histories Podcast\nMr.Bunker's Conspiracy Time Podcast - This one just ended, pretty lively and they talk about good topics.\n\nOur Fake History - This one is really interesting, they talk about things that aren't true in the accepted history narrative.\n\nHistorical Blindness - Same as previous in a lot of ways, both really good shows.\n\nKnifepoint Horror - This one is real creepy. Mostly the early stuff, he tells a story from the 1st person and it's honestly unnerving at times, really well done. Dude never breaks the 4th wall, no commercials, just content. \n\nExpanded Perspective - This one has been around for a while. There's a bunch of fluff in the beginning but they have a \"break\" which is about 5 minutes of music, and then they come back and get to the meat. \n\nConspiracy Class \n\nthe Bible and Beyond - I really like theology and weirdness within it, this show is great for that.\n\nArt Bell Back in Time - The classic. A lot of radio effects which isn't awesome but no commercials and the nostalgia is amazing.",

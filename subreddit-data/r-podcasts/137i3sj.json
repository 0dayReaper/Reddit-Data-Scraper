I need the **Gore**, the **Voice acting** style, the **characters**, and the **content,** to me seemed so so GOOD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease does anyone know of anything similar?",

I think maybe The Magnus Archives is the only thing I've listened to that comes close, but even with as weird as Magnus gets in the end the gore and shock value isn't at the same level. Archive 81 and I am in Eskew are very different (body horror, surreal horror), but some of those shows made me feel almost as uncomfortable as Darkest Night.",

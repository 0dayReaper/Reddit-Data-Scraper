I like Duncan's granularity and his ability to scope in and out effectively over long narratives. When he tells the story of the French Revolution, I feel like I get a really good picture of the domestic politics, the foreign affairs, and the cultural stuff going on without feeling like I have forgotten about one or the other over the course of the season.\n\nAlso the Revolutions series on Haiti is perhaps one of the best pieces of historical audio documentary of all time period.",

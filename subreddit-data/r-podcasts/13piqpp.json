    "postText": "I\u2019m learning Italian and I\u2019d like to try listening to some interesting podcasts in Italian. I\u2019d like to find some that cover science, international current affairs or international pop culture. Preferably with  hosts that use mostly standard Italian and don\u2019t talk over each other too much.  I already listen to some from Il Post and Il Sottosopra, but I\u2019d like to branch out and would be grateful for your suggestions!",

            "comment": "I'm not affiliated but try out these two channels for a start, whether they are on your level or a little below, it's always useful to listen to slow and clear voices imho:\n\n* podcastitaliano, it's got a pretty wide range of topics and you can choose the episodes depending on your level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), they use standard Italian and they also provide the episode transcript if you need to follow along or listen again a second time, also, plenty of other helpful material (some for free, some for subscribers only)\n\n* newsinslowitalian, similar, with weekly programs, among which they have a science/technology one, with a PDF transcript (more for Intermediate and Advanced users though)\n\nFor podcasts wholly dedicated to science, I guess you are already listening to \"Ci vuole una scienza\" by the Post, so if you don't find it too difficult, give the following ones a try, but they are harder in my opinion:\n\n* Scientificast, it's been around for quite some years and offers over 350 episodes so you'll get plenty of chance to practice listening\n\n* The Real Genius by Storieliberefm, dedicated to science and technology people in history. Check out the other podcasts on this platform, they are all quite good.\n\n* radio3scienza, it's a daily program by Italian broadcaster Rai so diction is perfect. Actually, I would recommend to spend quite some time on their website in case you don't know it already: raiplaysound is their new platform where you can listen to radio streaming, podcasts, audiobooks and even archived tv series rendered in radio format for listening in Italian\n\nThere are many more scientific Italian podcasts but either you need to check them out for language (ie. Fottuti geni) or are not free (requiring an Audible subscription, I'm thinking about \"Il giro della fisica in 12 mondi\" by De Biasio and Mercadini...)\n\nBtw, last but not least, a \"foreign\" suggestion:\n\n* Il giardino di Albert, it's a long running scientific podcast by RSI, the Swiss Italian channel based in Canton Ticino, here a little bit of insight for you as most teachers might warn you about the differences of the language spoken in that Swiss region vs \"the official Italian\" but to be honest they are very minor, and practically undetectable when talking about science, after all most of their guests are Italian, but I thought it was worth warning you about this issue (if you'd like to read about it in Italian, start [here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_italiana_in_Svizzera) and [here](https://it.babbel.com/it/magazine/italiano-svizzero)). \n\nMinor linguistic differences aside, I'd say that the Italian Swiss television offers podcasts of very good quality, lots of them! Some way better than Rai in my humble opinion, I would recommend you try and see for yourself, then decide if they are interesting/useful to you. My advice would be not to worry too much about the minor linguistic differences, simply try to avoid podcasts specific to Canton Ticino (unless you'd like to be exposed to those few \"pesky\" words like zibac /s\n\nYou can use both Rai and RSI for international affair programs (I'm thinking about Radio3Mondo, Rassegna Stampa, there are so many on the three main channels...), but if I were you I'd try to widen your horizons so you can listen to different registers/accents/opinions, you'll quickly start to notice the difference between standard and regional dictions. For instance, Radio Radicale has plenty of materials but it might get quite boring, Radio 24 offers many podcasts but they tend to be on the \"fast talking\", ditto for the other main newspapers, so probably harder for you to listen. \n\nTry first to see if you can find a speaker that you understand better and start listening daily, then don't be afraid to explore further programs/platforms. For instance, \"In 4 minutes\" by The Vision might be easy as they speak slowly and clearly, but the podcasts by Ansa (the main Italian news agency) will offer you a more real listening experience, ie. ansa-voice-daily lasts only 2-3 minutes, give it a listen and see what you make of it. \n\nHope this helped!",

They're super nice.\n\nradiopapesse.org is an online audio archive devoted to contemporary art; it is a place for the documentation and the articulation of a critical discourse around the visual arts and at the same time it is a radio project dedicated to sound art production and distribution. It produces and shares documentaries and interviews, as well as exhibitions and museum collections storytelling. It has embraced radio not only as a medium but also as a language to communicate art making and art practices today.",

            "comment": "If you are looking for an Italian and Italian podcast to learn or simply practice your Italian language, then I recommend [Italiano ON-Air](https://podcast.scuolaleonardo.com). Every week they publish an episode of a maximum of 5 minutes and on ever-changing themes: culture, current events, idioms, Italian customs. And every week you learn new words ;)  \nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for podcasts in Italian on different topics, there are plenty of them. If you tell me what kind of style you prefer I can suggest you several very interesting podcasts.  \nNow for example I'm listening to [Beer Revolution](https://podcasts.apple.com/it/podcast/beer-revolution/id1618773759). It's a podcast that tells the story of craft beer in Italy and each episode also suggests a beer to taste. A comic was also born from this podcast.  \nIf you like sports, and especially football, then here is a truly unique podcast: [Cronache di Spogliatoio](https://open.spotify.com/show/51UmJw2olCxZDkFJKIU34K). Here you can find stories and anecdotes about the most popular sport in Italy. We're not just talking about famous players, but about what's happening inside and outside the world of football.  \nAnother very particular podcast that is having great success in Italy is [PROBLEMI](https://www.spreaker.com/show/problemi-zenti) by Jonathan Zenti. They are very long and with themes that are not always very light but they guarantee that the listening goes by quickly.  \nIf, on the other hand, you were looking for a \"journalistic\" podcast, then we suggest [Il Mondo](https://www.internazionale.it/ilmondo). It is the daily podcast of Internazionale and every day Claudio Rossi Marcelli and Giulia Zoli comment on some news with the editorial staff and often there is also space for advice on music, film or literature.  \nI hope I have helped you in your search. Not knowing exactly what you were looking for, I suggested completely different things. If that's not what you were looking for, or you would like something specific, just ask and I'll try to answer you better ;)",

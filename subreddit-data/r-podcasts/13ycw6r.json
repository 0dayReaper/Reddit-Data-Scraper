I absolutely love the podcast Normal Gossip and they post few episodes at a time which means its super bingeable!\n\nive been looking for other podcasts like it and discovered a few through this subreddit but nowhere near as good or similar to Normal Gossip BUT\n\nI just discovered Petty Crimes! people write in petty non crimes they have experienced or done themselves like getting their neighbors cars towed and things like that. Super funny lighthearted and just fills that same space so if any of you love normal gossip I hope you try this and like it too!!",

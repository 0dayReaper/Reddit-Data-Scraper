No forensic evidence whatsoever. A huge set of unanswered questions and an extremely shaky motive. The standard of evidence was super low and conviction was based on credibility- Jay being a good witness and Adnan's lawyer being very abrasive and a terrible advocate for her client. Should a he said, he said be the essentially sole basis of a life sentence conviction? I don't think so. This wasn't a slam dunk case by any means",

And like magic, less than a week later he walks free.\n\nThat says a lot about where the true power resides in the criminal justice system.\n\nEdit: And think about this--he has been wrongly imprisoned since February ***2000***. When he went to jail, 9/11 had not even happened yet. There was no such thing as an iPhone. The latest gaming system was the **Nintendo 64**. That is how long he has been in jail for.

If he did do it, he should have been convicted on stronger evidence to remove all doubt, give everyone closure and prevent the conviction being overturned.  \n  \nBut if someone can be convicted like this, then it could potentially happen to an innocent person (regardless of whether it did in this case), which is a scary thought.",

He seemed like an asshole like he didn't deserve the massive amount of support he was getting. There was a story about him stealing money from some mosque fund raising drive. I'm not pro-religion in the slightest but that story irked me. That show at least made him appear like someone who could snow people with superficial charm while stealing from their pocket.\n\nThat of course doesn't mean he is a murderer. Also I never felt like there was a case made that he had much of a motive. It was more of a 'she broke up with him so of course he murdered her', while also presenting evidence that they still more or less got along.",

I, unlike most, don\u2019t believe someone should be freed just because of some shoddy police work. A witness saying he helped bury a body is not \u201cnothing\u201d. If he did it, he did it. I will be sick to my stomach if I hear they\u2019re paying him reparations for the time he did spend in prison. Its like OJ all over again.\n\nI hope they retrial with the DNA evidence, but with the public pressure the DA may just say F it.",

I don\u2019t have much time today, but I did a bit of looking back and it seems like the car getting moved was covered in detail in the documentary episode 2, someone please correct me if that\u2019s wrong. \n\nThe most recent motion that led to Adnan\u2019s release references 2 suspects, both that were spoken to and not followed up on. Jay was extensively spoken to and was charged, so he can\u2019t be one of the current suspects. He didn\u2019t lead cops to the body, he told an ever-evolving story about burying the body, and the lividity still doesn\u2019t match up with his final story. It actually might have been easier for the cops to scare Jay into making up statements than to actually investigate. For detailed information on Jay and the cops, it\u2019s all in undisclosed season 1. They pull it all apart and back up with proof and experts in different areas.",

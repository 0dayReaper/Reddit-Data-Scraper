    "postText": "Does the equivalent of Rotten Tomatoes / IMDb / Letterboxd exist for podcasts yet?\n\nSay what you will about the ratings, but they're usually a pretty reliable signal of whether or not something is worth your time - particularly for niche content.\n\nThe problem I find generally with podcast recommendations, like on this sub, is that they're so subjective, and people are judging them on a relatively small pool. (The type of person who uses those sites above have seen 500+ movies, but even an average podcast enthusiast probably hasn't listened to more than 50 podcasts).\n\nEDIT:  Ooh, IMDb has 'Podcast Series' and 'Podcast Episodes' as [categories that can be rated/searched](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=podcast_series&amp;num_votes=100,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc).  \n\n\n[Podchaser](https://www.podchaser.com/episodes) seems close to what I'm looking for.",

As you mentioned, Podchaser seems to be the furthest along; but it's fairly simple (at least, if you know what you're doing - it's not simple for **me**) to pull up an API for a podcast directory, usually Apple, to get a comprehensive listing of podcasts. The rest is probably basic coding. That's why there are so many.",

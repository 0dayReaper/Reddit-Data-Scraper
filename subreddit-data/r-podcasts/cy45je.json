I find a lot of these comedians funny (initially) but their constant complaining completely ruins the listening experience.\n\nIt usually goes like: *says something edgy* \"uh oh I'm getting crucified for this on the internet, aren't I?\" or something along those lines.\n\nIt's a blessing to find genuinely funny people (dark humour or not) who don't complain about \"current climate\" or the \"me too era\" \"ruining comedy.\"\n\nAnd, if anyone has suggestions for good comedy podcasts with 2 hosts and no guests please let me know.",

It\u2019s just something people say. Like how some people essentially use \u201cfuck\u201d as punctuation.

They don't play colleges because they money isn't good enough - these are theater comics making tens of thousands each show, not to mention their demographic isn't 18-22 year olds.  They wouldn't be playing colleges regardless.  On a sidenote, I hate when Maher talks about knowing what people in Alabama or Kansas are thinking because he played a show there.  If you perform for 2000 people in Birmingham, that doesn't mean you know anything about Birmingham - it only means you maybe know something about the 2000 self-selected people who came to your show in Birmingham. \n\nBack to the main point, if you do a joke and the audience is offended, it's not your fault or their fault - it's just a bad match.  You made an amazing steak dinner and it turns out all your customers are vegan - nobody's wrong, but nobody's happy.  Hopefully you have enough material to adjust to what they want.  \n\nSomething that's been true since the first joke - some comedians will make excuses.  Sure, sometimes the material didn't work because you pushed too hard against cultural norms, or because the audience was 'too' uptight, or because they knee-jerk reacted to their gut instead of taking a moment to see the nuance of what you were saying...but sometimes, the joke just wasn't funny.  \"I think that joke went over their heads.\"  \"No, they understood it.  It just wasn't funny.\"\n\nAll that said, social media has changed an important dynamic - it's much harder for well-known comics to bomb, and bombing is how you build material.\n\nI worked with a comic who was around in the late 70s in LA - he talked about how Richard Pryor would get up on stage on a Monday night with new material that would just bomb.  Then he'd see him at an open mic on Tuesday and he would bomb a little less.   Then Wednesday and Thursday, and each show the material would be tweaked and would do better and better, and then by the weekend the new bits would be amazing.  Try to do that now, and a cell phone video of that crappy Monday set would go viral, and everyone would call you a has-been.  \n\nObviously, famous comics are still able to build new material, but it is trickier.",

Comics need the freedom to say stupid things, because that's how you work through ideas.  I guarantee that a lot of Louis CK's most brilliant, universally acclaimed bits started out as highly offensive explorations.  BUT, at a paid gig I don't think you should be working on material - they paid for your A-game.  \n\nAll that said, I have to comment on: \"Isn't it the comedian's job to adjust to the room/crowd/times/norms/cultural mores, rather than the paying crowd to modify or acquiesce to the \"art\"?\"\nMaybe not.  Look, you hired me knowing what I do - you can't expect me to be different.  If you hire Bill Burr to perform at your church picnic, don't get upset when he's not family friendly.  You don't hire Metallica to play at your grandma's wake.",

I think some of the time they are actually being insensitive and rather than simply accepting that and moving on they attribute it to their unique comedic genius separating them from society and leaving them misunderstood or something. Nah, sometimes you just said something shitty. \n\nThe cool thing about humor and the concept of free speech is that it's okay for people to fuck up in both directions. It's important that some comedians push too far over the line or else we'd never know where the boundaries are. A bunch of middle aged guys upset that they can't still get laughs with simple misogyny would rather complain about society moving forward than just be clever. \n\nIn the end, it's all about whether the offensive part is the point of the joke or part of the setup. At least a few people will be upset about everything, and those people can just be ignored. It's also possible that some of the comedians we grew up loving haven't been able to grow with the times. Norm Macdonald comes to mind. He was a hero to me but he just sounds like an out of touch old man. And he sounds grumpy, and there is no wit underlying any of his whining. \n\nI guess after all comedians are just people too. And just like people in general should stop pretending they are upset to demonstrate how woke they are - comedians should stop pretending that they 'get it' when no one else does. When society tells you your joke isn't funny you prove them wrong by making them laugh - not by having a debate.",

How technology has made it easier for people to be more vocal.\n\nI think it's what you take away from these podcasts. They're sharing what's a very real thing in professional comedy and the joy it can take away from their profession. I really like listening to 2 comedians talk about it.",

He\u2019s got flagrant 2 (which has 1-2 other co-hosts, depends) and the brilliant idiots with Charlemagne tha God. He\u2019s been kind of shunned by the mainstream comedy industry in terms of opportunities cause of his work but he combats that by releasing stuff on his own on YouTube etc.",

Any time it\u2019s come up they\u2019ve always seemed pretty straight on the fact that Dave will find articles online and mostly use a primary source with other extra little bits and pieces he found elsewhere...\n\nFor like the last hundred or so episodes they mention at the end that they have a website which cites their sources, it something like dollopsources.com or something. Ever since someone else complained that they didn\u2019t cite their sources well enough, so they consulted some kind of entertainment lawyer or something and they were told citing the sources on that site and directing listeners to it was legally sufficient for what they were doing. \n\nAnd now because of whoever else is upset they\u2019re directly referencing the main source at the end of an episode. \n\nAt least for me, the primary appeal of the show is the banter between the 2. \n\nHearing Gareth being absolutely dumbstruck at some of the crazy shit is hilarious, hearing Gareth and Dave riff on stuff is why I listen to the show. \n\nIf I wanted pure history I\u2019d just listen to Dan Carlin. \n\nI listen to the dollop for comedy - for me, the primary draw is the comedy/banter, and you\u2019re not really criticising that at all. \n\nYou\u2019re criticising them as historians - they\u2019re lazy historians, sure. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call them lazy comedians.",

    "postText": "This is a long shot. I am searching for a podcast episode. I do not remember the podcast itself. It was professionally produced and popular (e.g.,Freakonomics, Hidden Brain, This American Life).  The episode started with a man, I think he was with the FBI (or similar), and he was on the subway (or bus?) and some kind of attack occurred. He described slowing down his thinking so he could evaluate the options even though his life was in danger. That is all I heard from the episode and I'd like to find it again. It seems like this episode was part of a short series on self improvement or something. I've searched the net, the archives of several podcasts using what I recall, but no luck. If anyone has any memory of this, I'll take any leads. Thanks!",

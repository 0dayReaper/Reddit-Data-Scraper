It's one guy who occasionally does a funny voice or a made up sponsor. LPotL is three guys constantly screaming, screeching, and hooting across one another. Plus one of them laughs loudly through every single episode. I tried listening to them (their topics are very well researched) but the constant interruptions, lame jokes, and talking over one another was too big of a distraction. None of that occurs in Timesuck.",

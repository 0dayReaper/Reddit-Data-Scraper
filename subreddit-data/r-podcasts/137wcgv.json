I also enjoy [Jokes With Mark Simmons](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/jokes-with-mark-simmons/id1455723980) where comedian Mark Simmons interviews other comics and asks them about jokes that they've struggled to make work in the past and they see if they can work out how to rephrase the material or whatever to make it successful.",

Any podcast recommendations that cover this? Keep in mind, it would have to start at the beginning rather than just jump right into the current drama because like I said, I know nothing",

For weekly updates, Pod Save the King is great. To understand the current branch of the family, you need an intro to Victoria and her children, who her children married, and how that played into WWI. There are many nuances the Vanity Fair podcast may miss (I haven\u2019t listened so it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t miss this) but understanding Prince Philip\u2019s origins (Prince of Greece) and Mountbatten (German family) is important but I haven\u2019t run across any podcasts on that. The monarch isn\u2019t the head of a soap opera but the  head of state in 14 countries and the commonwealth (though commonwealth isn\u2019t heredity).",

AtN and This is Important definitely are, and I'm pretty sure Crooked Media is in the same realm since they have similar sponsors and run ads for shows on iHeart-adjacent networks. iHeart have recently bumped up the number of commercials in one ad break from the usual 2 to 3/4. I listen to quite a large of number of shows that suffer from this, and it is definitely a concerted effort on their part.",

I don\u2019t mind ads up to a certain level because of course podcasters deserve to get paid, but 75%+ of the ad run time in PSA isn\u2019t related to the product/service or even the podcast topic, it\u2019s just incoherent rambling.\n\nAll iHeart shows have a ton of ads compared to most indie productions so it just seems par for the course with any of their productions at this point. They have some great shows but you just have to brace yourself to have it interrupted pretty frequently.",

I also don't mind the repeat ads, because I know that the midroll is just serving up the best it can for someone outside the primary demographic. I'll even forgive an excessively long intro if the rest of the adbreaks are reasonably compact. I have the technology to skip them, and I'm under no obligation to try them.\n\nIt's just a mite infuriating to break a pattern that worked pretty well for 5 years all of a sudden for a good chunk of the shows I enjoy all because iHeart are trying to squeeze every dollar out of all their shiny new networks.",

I'm a social media person you've never heard of and I'm here to tell you all about the inane drivel I'm spouting with my friend on our new podcast 'It's Only Funny to Us!!!!'\"\n\n\nIt just felt wrong, going from a woman crying about the abuse she suffered and the lasting impact this experience had on her, to two people touting a podcast about TikTok celebrities. I get that podcasts need to run ads to make money, but you'd think they could at least try and choose ads for things that don't completely change the mood of what you're listening to. \n\nPlus I get that the nice thing about podcasts is that people who all enjoy a thing can get to discuss and engage with that thing without it needing to be mainstream or supported by big Radio stations. But also, I swear iHeartRadio just chucks money at the wall to see what sticks. Some of their ads are so niche that it basically boils down to eavesdropping on a bunch of people you don't know chatting shit about their friends and in-jokes at a party.",

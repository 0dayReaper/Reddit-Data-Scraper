The great courses are phenomenal for university level education, and audiobooks you can \"seek and peck\" topics and points of view. My kid loves history, for example, and his favourite thing to to is to find a significant historical event, but the author is from an uninvolved country and writing for an uninvolved audience. American history written by a brit. Japanese history written by a Norwegian. It's a very different viewpoint.\n\nDocumentaries will always be for generalists. You aren't a generalist any more.",

I'm thinking of 'You're Dead to Me' (BBC history with academics and conedians), 'The Infinite Monkey Cage' (science with academics and comedians), 'Switched on Pop' (songwriter and musicologist overcoming their past musical snobbery). For more serious, nuanced deep dives into particular topics, 'Thinking Allowed', 'Serial', the Anthill's series on 'Conspiracy Theories' and 'Recovery',  BBC's 'The Lazarus Heist' and 'The Coming Storm' and Pineapple's 'Will be Wild' are all excellent.",

Contact your library because a lot of them have incredible free streaming services (audio and ebooks, film, tv and music, as well as educational content) through a variety of platforms. My library gives me access to 7 different apps, all with plenty of great content (though it was hard to find on the library website, once I found it, its been amazing)",

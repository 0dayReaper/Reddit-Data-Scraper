What podcasts either spin up specifically for this topic, or do a good job covering it in general?\n\nI\u2019m a fan of how shows like Stranglehold and Caucusland from NPR did it several years ago, would love some more recommendations.",

They both have a good sense of humor so I get a couple laughs too.\n\nHell or High Water with J. Heilman is on vacation as he runs the Recount website too, but it will be back. Excellent long form interviews on politics.\n\nAmy Walter of the Cook Political Report hosts the Odd Years that comes out every couple of weeks. She guests on some podcasts too. So, entering her name in the search bar leads to some good episodes.",

They're just being a priori dismissive of RFK Jr and Marianne Williamson instead of really honestly covering their primary runs, which is especially frustrating given that RFK Jr has been at remarkably high polling numbers for someone running against an incumbent, higher than most of the Republican primary contenders they *are* taking seriously. \n\nIf there are any political podcasts out there that are *actually covering the Democratic primary race*, I'd be very interested.",

Basically like listening to a documentary. I can't stand those 'talking head' style podcasts where the hosts try to be quirky or meander off topic the whole time.",

Tiny nit in that he very occasionally steps over the line imagining what people were thinking, but is by far the best history podcast I\u2019ve tried in terms of painting a picture in my head.

The podcast is grounded in primary sources and a lot of secondary reading, so you get a medieval individual's perspective and words, but you also get the background, the larger events they were participating in, and the direction history was headed once their story was done.*\n\n*With Human Circus, I take you along with medieval history's most interesting travellers, whether they be merchant, friar, pilgrim, crusader, soldier, ambassador, or explorer. We follow them into Mongol Karakorum, Ottoman Constantinople, and Mamluk Cairo, into Safavid Iran, Saadi Morocco, or Alexander's Gate. There'll be assassins, infinite porpoises, and the stone-cracking cold. Join us*",

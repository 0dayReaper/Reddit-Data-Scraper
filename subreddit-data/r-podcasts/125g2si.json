    "postText": "\n\nHi there, I\u2019m a French big podcast listener would like to extend my possibilities by switching to English.\nI\u2019m looking for podcasts where people are talking about events happened in their life, life stories. Preferably with no interviewer remarks and good audio recording (no phone call) \n\n+ I\u2019m also looking for good programs where people explain and debate about ecological issues, or feminist topics, or both :) \n\nThanks all !",

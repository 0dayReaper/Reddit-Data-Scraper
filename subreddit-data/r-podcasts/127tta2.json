I downloaded the app, logged in as a prime member and I'm getting a message saying I need to upgrade my membership to get this.. Would anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong?\n\n\nThanks",

The few Wondery podcasts I listen to: The Lead, Starting Five and How I Built This are all ad-free on the part of Amazon Music which is included with Prime. I don't have a paid Amazon Music Unlimited subscription.\n\n1. I don't know if all Wondery podcasts are included but since Amazon owns them I'd be surprised if they weren't.\n1. It seems like every episode is included in the ones I subscribe to, at least it seems that way since Amazon doesn't allow marking all unplayed and I have gone back through all of these to try to get rid of old episodes which Amazon keeps serving up automatically unless they are marked played.",

I like allot of the stuff and had considered subscribing before but if I could do so for free well all the better.. I might consider moving to apple music unlimited anyway at some stage.. I'm on Spotify for music  but their podcast interface is dreadful, But that's for another day",

There is no way to mark all episodes of a podcast as played. Each episode must be marked one at a time.\n2. Downloading episodes prevents most of the frequent crashing of the app which happens when trying to stream podcasts.\n3. The app frequently reverts to 1.0 speed on podcasts necessitating selecting faster speeds again and again.\n4. For no earthly imaginable reason the app only has limited speed choices.\n5. The episodes cannot be sorted.\n6. Downloaded episodes are automatically played in the order they are downloaded. They go from one episode to another without the choice set the player to automatically stop after one download.\n7. The search function is terrible. I use the web or Podcast Addict to find podcasts and then (if they are ones that are ad-free on Amazon I go and search for them on Amazon.)",

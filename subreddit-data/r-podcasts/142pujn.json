The shows have the same 3 hosts and they are amazing. It\u2019s clear they really love talking to each other and making each other laugh. Their episodes remind me of late night conversations between by best friends at Waffle House after watching these movies. Seriously. They are tons of fun. Both are weekly and have huge back catalogs. The Horror Virgin has like 270 episodes out and Romancing The Pod has like 150. They are great.",

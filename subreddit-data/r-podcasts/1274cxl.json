    "postText": "Just out of curiosity I asked Chat AI for a list of con, swindle or catfishing podcasts.  It indicated that it cannot provide lists as those topics are potentially bad influences to others.  I then asked for a list of good podcasts and it provided a list that had some true crime podcasts listed. I attempted to argue the point that true crime could be a bad influence as well but didn't get anywhere. Lol, I was kind of annoyed at AI for this.",

Am I missing something? Feel like all anyone talks about is confusion that Chat GPT didn't squirt water out of the microphone of their phone to wash their ass because they typed \"bidet\" into it.",

    "postText": "I'm looking for a Canadian News Recap podcast. I know I can listen to CBC and Global and all that, but I like having someone tell me the gist of top stories, some comments on them, maybe an expert about the impacts. it's also important that it's Canadian. I keep finding them for the US and Europe, and I'm jealous that there isn't one (that I've found) for Canada.",

Each season is spent focusing on one major industry and tracing the history of it. The most recent season delved into the major monopolies in Canada. Not exactly what you\u2019re looking for but I thought it was worth mentioning because finding investigative journalism about Canada (in podcast form) is not easy to come by.",

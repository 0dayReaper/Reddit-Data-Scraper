Ostensibly a riddles and puzzles podcast, but they spend a lot of it talking about how much they hate riddles and doing short improv scenes. They do a \u201cBest of\u201d episode each year, and you can test the waters there to see if you like it. If you do, I think it\u2019s best to start at the beginning. The old episodes hold up and a lot of their bits are recurring ones.\n\nEdit: I see someone already suggested this. Still going to leave it up here",

There is value in first hearing about something, of course, but there is also value in hearing multiple people give the same recommendations. It gives OP a chance to work out whether something is a niche offering or broadly successful and popular, it gives them two descriptions from different points of view, and more. So it's really not worthless at all, and I hope more people do what you did here.",

Malcolm just makes me giggle when he gets a bug up his butt about something, and they\u2019re all pretty fascinating and engaging. *Hallelujah* is one of my favorite pod eps ever, not a funny one but fascinating without being heavy. \n\nOoooh and *Heavyweight*! Okay this one is very mixed on range of light to serious, but one of my favorite pods of all time. Start with the earlier ones, as I think the more serious stories were more recent, but all really good and the host always lightens things up w/ his deadpan humor and awkwardness,",

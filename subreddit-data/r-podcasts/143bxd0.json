    "postText": "Hi there, hoping someone here might be able to find a podcast that I\u2019ve lost but would love to finish listening to\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t remember the name but I listened to it a while back on Apple Podcasts. It was all about the modern Christian revival movement, and the host was a woman who had grown up within a revival church (but had since left). \n\nIt was looking into how the movement came about and investigating the credibility of certain aspects. Unfortunately my attempts to find it are being bogged down by revival movement podcasts - this was more investigative journalism style into the movement, it was not a religious podcast. \n\nIf anyone knows what the name of this podcast might be I would be so happy!",

    "postText": "\"Comedians making boring things funny\" is and has been a really popular genre, and I used to listen to a lot of them, but I just can't do it anymore. There have just been so many times when I've looked into it myself or found out more about it later only to find that they've grossly misrepresented the story/information and are sometimes even perpetuating harmful bullshit because they've done the most cursory \"research\" possible. \n\nAnyway, anybody know of podcasts about history/science (anything really, I just like to learn new things) that are actually well researched but also entertaining (preferably from someone who actually specializes in the topic)? I don't mind if they're not hilarious/gripping, I'm just hoping for something a little less dry than one person reading a paper. I'm very sick of \"we don't know what we're talking about haha\" being the joke \ud83d\ude29\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all the amazing recommendations, I can't wait to start listening. If you're looking for something similar, this comment section is a gold mine.",

It's darker in tone than Darknet Diaries[](/u/jackrhysider), as it's about tracking down a child pornographer prolific on the darknet. It's gripping and you won't forget it. \n\nAnother miniseries is \"Cool Mules\", where they interview an editor for VICE Canada who was arrested for smuggling cocaine. It's kind of a lighter vibe than Darknet Diaries, but it's still great. \n\n\"Endless Thread\"[](/u/endless_thread) also just started a miniseries called \"Madness\" about Dr. Ewen Cameron who led a research project that was a precursor to the CIA's project MK Ultra. They're only two episodes into what will likely be a six parter",

I want to be clear I\u2019m not criticizing anyone for actually liking Hardcore History. It\u2019s a well done entertaining podcast that does a good job of giving an overview of the broad strokes of an historical topic but it is a podcast you should take with a grain of salt when it comes to the history and seems like the opposite of what the OP wants namely \u201cwell researched\u201d and looking for accuracy and expertise more than general entertainment value.",

I was mainly just trying to bring up something that specifically concerned the OP or those looking for accuracy above all when it comes to podcasts. Carlin is a good jumping off point for those who want to get the broad strokes of a subject down. \n\n\nAs for Now It Can Be Told I haven\u2019t read it but having just looked it up it seems like a very interesting book and reliable. Though I want to specify that by reliable I mean it probably does a really great job of talking about what it was like to be there and in the trenches or for some of the nitty gritty details of life at that time. However, I would expect it to probably have some of the flaws that any primary source written in the midst of or immediately after a war might have. Which is just a lack of perspective when it comes to the overall picture. But it seems like a great book if you want to get a feel for what it was like to be a soldier in the trenches or a war correspondent or on the home front or some of the ideas that circulated about the war during and immediately after. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/couy6y/can_anyone_recommend_a_ww1_diary_or_memoir_from_a/ewlfnen/) is a link to a brief recommendation someone posted on a different part of reddit that also briefly sums up what I\u2019m trying to get at about reading memoirs. Which is mainly just that they tell a story through a particular persons eyes. And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/wwi) is a link to /r/askhistorians booklist on WWI if you\u2019re looking for further reading on the subject that\u2019s a good place to look as it\u2019s generally pretty well curated.",

Our first season was on British prehistory. \n\nWe\u2019re in between seasons at the moment and so will be featuring multiple guests as well as lighter, less scripted shows so there should be something for everyone so long as they like the past.",

Note: I'm a huge Anglophile.\n\nThe History of England: Host David Crowther takes a meandering walk through English history, starting to really get going with 1066 and the Norman Invasion.\n\nThe British History Podcast: Host Jamie Jeffers takes a deep dive into British history. Unlike David Crowther's podcast, it starts with pre-history and then jumps in basically circa 100 and and after 300+ episodes still hasn't reached 1066's Norman Invasion.\n\nThe History of English: Host Kevin Stroud takes a deep dive into the history and evolution of the English language. From it's Indo-European origins.\n\nThe History of China: Host Chris Stuart takes you from the mythical founding of China. Currently dealing with the Mongol leadership of the Yuan dynasty.\n\nThe Ancient World: Host Scott does seasonal arcs, the first season was the classical period around the world. It's a really interesting show, but focuses mostly on Europe.\n\nThe Iroquois History and Legends Podcast: Hosts and brothers Andrew and Caleb Cotter play off each other well, but more importantly, they're both quite knowledgeable about the subject matter. Sadly on hiatus due to the virus outbreak and one of the brother's being stuck in Asia right now.\n\nThe History of Persia: Still a fairly young podcast, host Trevor Culley is working on a graduate degree in the subject currently. He gets a little deep sometimes on things that might not interest everyone.\n\nA History of the United States: A counter-point to Jamie Jeffers American accent teaching British history, host Jamie Redfern is an English historian telling the history of the U.S.",

The series tend to be riddled with innacuracies, a reliance on out of date sources and viewpoints, and a tendency to generalize to the point of meaninglessness or innacuracy. Dan Carlin has also consistently refused to address these issues by regularly using the \u201cI\u2019m not an historian.\u201d line instead of acknowledging the errors or making any sort of corrections. Though obviously the way he presents does not come across as if he just wants to be taken as entertainment. Which is all to say that it\u2019s an entertaining podcast and well done and here\u2019s nothing wrong with liking it but as history goes it should be taken with a grain of salt and since OP is asking specifically for \u201cwell researched\u201d I don\u2019t think it really belongs here.

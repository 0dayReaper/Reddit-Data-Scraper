    "postText": "Hey all, I'm pretty new to podcasts, I've mostly been listening to True Crime stuff, which I LOVE, it's so interesting to me however I am looking for crazy insane stories that sort of make you say out loud \"No way!\" or \"I can't believe that\" if that makes sense. \n\nDoesn't have to be 'True Crime' as such, but most stories involve some sort of crime lets be real.\n\nEnjoyed: \n\n\\- Believe in magic\n\n\\- Pretend: Stalker\n\n\\- Missing CryptoQueen \n\n\\- The Glitch\n\n\\- Radio Rental (God this show is great..!)\n\n\\- Scamanda\n\n\\- Snowball \n\nThese probably come under quite a broad genre but yeah just some like crazy mind blowing type stories that are pretty much unbelievable. \n\nThank you so so much in advance guys!!

It tells the stories of long ago crimes by book writers of today. Erik is a great interviewer who digs for the true answers. Some of the stories are unbelievable.  \n\nHope this helps",

To this day, her murder is unsolved, and nobody knows who the woman was.\n\nThe podcast has witness interviews with people who saw her, looks at her movements and her belongings, etc. to try to figure out who she was, what she was doing when she was alive, and how she died.",

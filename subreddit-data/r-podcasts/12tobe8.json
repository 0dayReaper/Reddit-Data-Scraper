    "postText": "My young teenager is really into geeky, immersive world type board games, as well as D&amp;D. Anyone have suggestions for \"entry level\" podcasts that might appeal to someone like that? By entry level, I mean pretty instantly engaging and accessible for someone just starting to listen to podcasts. I want to give him some things he can listen to on his headphones or smart speaker that might spark his imagination more or go in depth on interesting topics. Like smarter you tube, ha! \n\nHe is more into fantasy and characters than violence or horror. Anything too dark or scary would not work.",

Look for Reddit discussions about Balance, which is the name of the first season. My son had to bribe me into listening - and then we listened during every drive for all 69 episodes. Three brothers and their dad play D&amp;D. It starts off jokey and by the last episode you\u2019re in awe of where the DM has taken the story (and maybe shedding some tears). \n\nMy kids were in their late teens, maybe other Redditers can chime in on a good age to start this. Not that I mind some crude humor or f-bombs, but in terms of the length and emotional tone of the story.",

And when this season ended, they did continue doing other story arcs; I haven\u2019t listened to them all yet, but the first one seems to be everyone\u2019s favorite.",

    "postText": "I know this has probably been asked many times before but I\u2019m curious. \n\nI use to listen to my podcasts when commuting but with summer rolling around I find myself struggling to do anything else but to lie on my bed, close my eyes and listen. I\u2019ve tried doing little stuff like doodling or cleaning but I end up focusing on the actual task at hand rather than the podcast itself, which I would have to replay a bunch of times as a result. \n\nPodcasts are meant to be a way to relax and wind down but I can\u2019t help and feel as if I\u2019m wasting my time lying there like a dead fish. I understand that maybe I\u2019m just not fit to multi-task but I\u2019m curious to see what others are doing.",

I focus on one or the other.  Lots of electronic music, LoFI, some Baroque, early music, sacred music and ambient often fade nicely into the background.  Silence doesn't work for me but music without words does.  If you have Apple Music try the early music and scared music playlists as a start.  Most good music is made to pay attention to.  Not to make this a music thread but there is a lot of bad music. Pop will never work for studying, reading or or serious brain work.  Once you brain picks up works it wants to listen to them, no matter how insipid. My children do not have this problem.  they could always listen to music when studying and the all have Masters degrees so this might be an age thing.  Again, try the early music/sacred music thing.  Even if there are worlds they are probably in a language you don't understand.  BTW, some of it is really worth critical listening, but much of it was designed for accompaniment",

Three girls (and sometimes a guest) talk in detail about horror movies, one is a horror fan and relates the plots to the ones who are too scared to watch. I love it because I'm one of those people who's fascinated by scary stories but too chicken to watch the really nasty ones. The hosts are all really likable and entertaining with nice voices. Just three friends chatting about demons and mutilation lol.",

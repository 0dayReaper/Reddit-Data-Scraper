I just recently discovered the New Yorker Radio Hour, and I've only listened to a few clips so far, but I really like the style of their political coverage, and I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for podcasts that are similar in tone.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the suggestions! Have so many new podcasts to check out! And I just wanted to clarify one point. When I mentioned different POV, it wasn't necessarily with American politics in mind, just different perspectives in general/hearing people with different backgrounds and different life experiences discussing the same matter.",

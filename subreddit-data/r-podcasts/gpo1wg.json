    "postText": "Lore is a super interesting concept, the way it takes on the darker/ more unexplainable side of human history, discusses all that sort of thing that kinda feels like it lurks in the shadows of history.\n\nBut Jesus Christ it's the single most boring podcast in history. The man behind it can't write for his life, it feels stilted and awkward, and he really just meanders until he makes a point but not in an interesting way. So it's really a super wasted opportunity for something that could've been great.\n\nSo are there any podcasts that deal with the same sort of thing but in an interesting way that y'all would reccomend?",

            "comment": "I make a podcast that deals with material in the same vein called Dark Histories. To be completely honest, you may just find it equally as boring though, since it's another one man show. Have a look if you fancy it. It deals with the same sort of fringe history, from old medieval folklore to Victorian poisoners. In the early days I didn't really target any specific era, but I find myself carving out a niche in the Victorian/Georgian period quite a lot these days, though I do try and break it up. In general I tend to approach stuff from a sceptical viewpoint and examine the social history rather than \"I'm not saying it was ghosts but.. GHOSTS.\" [This is the Website if you do fancy it.](http://darkhistories.com)\n\nOthers that I enjoy are [Blurry Photos](http://www.blurryphotos.org/) and [Monster Talk](https://monstertalk.skeptic.com/).",

I love \"Historium\", I don't know why it isn't hugely well known, the topics are fascinating,not always creepy but usually so. The research is deep but most importantly the guy always finds the best angle to bring it to life. He only does an episode like once or twice a month but every episode just blows my mind, sometimes in relation to stuff I have never even heard of. I recommend \n\n\"The Cages of M\u00fcnster\" \nThe story of a bizarre Anabaptist revolution in 1500s Germany, they take over a city, people starve, orgies, skin flaying, and an ill advised war that they were sure they would win, it's got it all.\n\n \"Last of his Kind\" \nThe tragic story of Ishi, last of the Yahi tribe. Have some tissues ready.\n\n\"The Second Son of God\"\nTaiping rebellion, China,1850, guy decides he is the second coming of Jesus, 30 million people die.yep, it gets weird.\n\n\"Dark Tide\"\nA silo of molasses bursts in Boston, dozen are killed as entire streets are filled with brown gold, many health and safety laws are proposed for the first time in America.\n\n\"The Battle of Blair Mountain\" \n1921, West Virginia  thousands of coal miners strike in the biggest armed uprising since the Civil War, the U.S. government ultimately resorts to using the Air Force to bomb them off the mountain killing hundreds, largely it is a forgotten war.\n\n\"The Great Emu War\"\nAustralia once declares war on a bunch of birds(no really), and lost.(yes really)\n\n\n\n\"Almost a Thousand\" \nChristman Genipperteinga may well be the world's most prolific serial killer, and reportedly left 960 bodies in a cave in Germany. We see this through the eyes of the woman he held captive for seven years and impregnated multiple times, absolute nightmare fuel.\n\n\"Still They Danced\"\nThe fatal dancing plague of Medieval Europe, thought to have been caused by ergot poisoning.\n\n\"Landmark\"\nThe 1839 slave rebellion, in which we get a small taste of the life of a slave on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, honestly it haunts me months later to think about what those people went through, should be required reading for every school kid if it wouldn't scar them for life.\n\n\"The Man Who Saved The World\"\n The story of Vasili Arkopov, he saved your life and the life of everyone you know.",

It has the usual themes of darker stories, and much like lemons', it's all painfully researched and strives for historical authenticity. I only dip into folklore every now and then, though. I'm more prone to factual stories and individuals that are nefarious in nature. *Mania* investigates the 1300's - early 1900's.\n\nWhere it differs from other horror podcasts is that the tales are told with a spotlight on the *antagonist.* Rather than vilifying them, *Mania* attempt to understand and tell the story from *their* perspective, even if they're downright villains. I also weave fiction into the story if historical recounts have missing details, and then I sparse out what's true and false at the end.\n\nI derive a lot of my descriptions of death and other macabre details from my real-life experience as an undertaker. I like to think it adds some real spice.\n\nThe tagline of the show is *\"These are the stories of monsters whose voices are lost in history.\"*\n\nWhat a lot of my listeners enjoy is my particular style with prose and storytelling. I've been writing dark fiction for six years--hopefully it counts for something. It's funny what you said about *Lore*, basically the only reason why I got up and started my own podcast was that I was so fed up with his execution of such a great concept, I decided to come up with my own twist.\n\nI'll leave [Mania's website here](http://harlequingrim.com) for anybody who might be interested.",

A few less popular ones I really like are Strange Matters and Just a Story. Strange Matters took a minute to find their footing so the earlier episodes sound very different but I really enjoy their show. Just a Story does amazing research, but their hosts have a lot of personality, so you'll hafta see if it's the kind of show you like. I also wanna throw in Stuff You Missed in History class, it's more lighthearted but occasionally delves into creepier content.",

Since there are a lot of version of different stories, he'll generally pick and choose what makes the most sense narratively, but will also mention what he's left out or the gist of alternate versions.\n\nFictional is him telling crib notes versions of classic literature.

He toes the line of calling out how silly most of the stories are, while still respecting the context that they were originally told in. \n\nHe has another podcast that he's starting back up again where he retells short stories from what I think is mostly the 1800's. Equally as good, but he doesn't have nearly as much content produced on that podcast.",

It's a comedy show about things like the supernatural, lore, criptids, the occult, true crime, weird/crazy stories, and stuff in that general area. All while making jokes or funny takes on it all. It's not exactly Lore but it plays with that genre a lot and always has fun with it.",

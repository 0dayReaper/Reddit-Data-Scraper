    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for a new podcast to listen to at work. I quite enjoy ones where a narrator reads stories about scary/unsettling/etc. stuff that aren\u2019t entirely focused around typical paranormal stuff like demons and ghosts but instead more \u201cscience\u201d based. I don\u2019t mean strictly non-fiction stuff, more that it COULD happen in real life or that I can imagine myself as the character in the story if that makes sense. Basically science fiction stuff. \n\nSome good examples of other podcast that show what I mean are: SCP Foundation, The Noclip Podcast, and the \u2018Let\u2019s Read\u2019 podcast\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

It's often about life or death situations- being robbed, losing an arm, animal attacks, plane crashes, etc.\n\nNow that I'm thinking about it, there's a pretty popular podcast about animal attacks. \"tooth &amp; claw\"",

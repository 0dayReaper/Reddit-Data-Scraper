    "postText": " Hbyi everyone, I'm looking for some podcast recommendations. Over the last few weeks, I have really enjoyed listening to the Shit You Don't Learn in School podcast by Calvin Rosser and Steph Smith. It's a show that covers topics like personal and professional development, entrepreneurship, technology, psychology, and more. I find it very intellectually stimulating and inspiring. Do you know any podcasts similar to this one that you find intellectually stimulating? Please share your suggestions and why you like them. Thanks!",

It is the depth which they go into it and I like their dynamic, there's something about it that I can't explain. As well I like that they are young. Nothing wrong of course with podcasts by people a bit older but I find it refreshing that they are this age and thinking about life in this depth doesn't really matter. Thank you, this is prompted me to think a bit more deeply",

In their first episode they discuss Freakonomics and do a whole debunk/analysis of the claims the book makes.",

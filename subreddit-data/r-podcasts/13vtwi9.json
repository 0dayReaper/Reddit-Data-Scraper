Like breaking down themes, character arcs, how the medium is used, political statements, etc. I\u2019m having trouble finding one that isn\u2019t specifically centered around books.",

Basically takes a look at the rise and fall of the \"Erotic Thriller' genre that exploded and then disappeared by the end of the millennium. I enjoyed it and it gave me a new list of films to watch.",

They go through each of the movies plotlines and also discuss what the director and stars where doing at the time the film was made (with a nice blend of humor and interesting discussion).  The current series is about Buster Keaton but previous miniseries have covered Michael Mann, Paul Verhoven, Elaine May, and lots of others.",

No question: if want to explore motivation, arcs, construction of movies/tv shows, John and Craig are the best in the business. (Doesn't hurt that they're collectively both current, successful writers in Hollywood). They've been incredibly influential for us!",

I have varied takes on different media from all sorts of mediums. I don\u2019t think my analyses are something not to be trusted, I think they\u2019re just my personal interpretation of a work, and I\u2019m pretty much looking for someone else who shares that same interest. The closest I\u2019ve found is Office Hours with Dr. C. However rather than literary analyses of the text itself, they talk more about the cultural impact of various works. I\u2019m looking for an internal lens.",

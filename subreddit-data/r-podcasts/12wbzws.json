    "postText": "I've pretty much watched all of Destiny's 1 on 1 debates and i need some new stuff.  I enjoy watching his debates because he's extremely honest and is not afraid to challenge and engage even far right extremists.   \n\n\nI'm not looking for reactionaries or people who will simply call people who disagree with them racist. I don't mind if the guests display these qualities but i need someone that will contest them on these points in a logical and effective way.   \n\n\nTldr: looking for a debate podcast with a logical host who's left leaning and not afraid to get his hands dirty.",

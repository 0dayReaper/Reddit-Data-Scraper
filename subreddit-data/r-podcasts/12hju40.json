    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m looking for a news podcast that breaks things down in really simple terms. I listen to NPR Up First and NYT The Daily, but I would love something else to add to my list. I am a really bad listener and it\u2019s hard to keep my attention, so I\u2019m hoping for something that could be easy enough to understand that I stay informed and hopefully improve my listening skills. Maybe something even tailored to kids? Let me know if you have any recs.",

From there I found a related NPR podcast that covers current legislative news for my state which is great as that stuff confuses the hell out of me. \n\nI also enjoy Morning Announcements from Betches- closest I can find to having a friend give me the deets on current events lol, could maybe see why it\u2019s not for everyone!",

So, it keeps the show more interesting than someone just recapping the news solo.\n\nBBC Crowdscience on the science field is interesting. They have readers phone in or email science questions. So, they have some topics that connect to the average listener like is my pet German Shepherd different than a wolf regarding his genes.",

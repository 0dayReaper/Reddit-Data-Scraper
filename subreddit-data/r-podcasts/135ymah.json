    "postText": "I'm trying to remember an episode of a podcast where they definitively debunk the conspiracy theory that Hitler survived WW2 and escaped to Argentina.  If I recall the episode centered around Adolf Sch\u00fcttelmayor and the forgery of Hitler's personal diaries.  \n\nI thought it was a Behind the Bastards episode but a search didn't find it. Didn't find it on It Could Happen Here either.  I still feel like it's Robert Evans/iHeartRadio adjacent, but maybe I'm way off here and that's why I can't find it. \n\nTrying to recommend this episode to a friend.  Your help is greatly appreciated!",

The age and condition of the bones isn't anywhere near to making it challenging to extract DNA from like...\\~2g of sample. I promise I have expert knowledge in this domain.\n\nEDIT: sorry, my previous response here was mean. I am just expressing as best I can that based on my knowledge of the field, it is highly plausible that an attempt to extract complete enough DNA from the remains to verify them would succeed, and so the fact that the Russians have never even tried, nor permitted anyone else to, is highly suggestive. It's just cold war theatre, and not even in the top 10 most insane things the Soviets and Americans have lied to one another about.",

Why no DNA analysis? Because Russians don't permit it. Why not? It's trivial to perform and wouldn't require a significant sample.\n\nTo be clear I think Hitler died in 1945 in Berlin, but the Russians genuinely never found his body.",

The forensic dental study was done in 1973. Bear in mind that the documents in the National Archives contain a set of X-rays of Hitler's skull which serve as a verified forensic template against which the details of the dental features of his corpse compared. In order for the Russians to successfully falsify the record of the dental features of the corpse they would have needed access to the documents in the hands of the Americans. They didn't have that access, nor did the Americans have access to the evidence held by the Russians. How did the Russians falsify the evidence they held so as to make it fit with that held by the Americans when they didn't even know at the time that it existed?",

The Russians declared him dead before the Americans even knew what they had.\n \nAs for any suggestion of falsified evidence by the Russians and/or Americans, they would have needed to get together and collaborate to make it work. Bear in mind that the Cold War began even before the last shots were fired in Berlin. The seeds of mutual distrust and suspicion were sown at the Yalta Conference. Both sides were jockeying for primacy in the postwar world, neither was going to give the other anything that would allow them to get a leg up in their newly generated rivalry. Even during the war the Western Allies and the USSR never really trusted one another. They cooperated to whatever extent was needed, but no more.",

Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler's dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin.

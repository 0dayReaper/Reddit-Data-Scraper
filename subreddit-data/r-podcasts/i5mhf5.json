Lately it has been less \"here are some historical, potentially relevant bastards\" or \"here are some current bastards, whose actions are not pertinent to general american* society\" and more \"here are current bastards who, if not felt immediately, have actions have a ripple effect that can be felt to a certain degree for north americans\". I personally don't think a podcast about the US Border Patrol is more depressing than a podcast about King Leopold II, but it certainly has a more immediate relevance to North Americans and can invoke a stronger response. That being said, I don't want to discount your feelings about the episodes.\n\n*edit",

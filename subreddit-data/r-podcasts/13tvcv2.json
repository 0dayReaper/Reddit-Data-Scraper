    "postText": "I'd like to learn more about how non-fiction radio narrative storytelling emerged and evolved and/or how podcasts emerged from them later. Are there any good books or articles on this?\n\nI'm thinking mostly about the This American Life style that pioneered that kind of storytelling. I've read  both Jessica Abel's books/comics (Out on the Wire and the earlier Radio An Illustrated Guide), which were fantastic, but much more about the process of making narrative radio than its history.",

I'll google it in a sec here\n\n(It didn't help with the insomnia, but it helped with the stress, which helped with the insomnia lol)\n\nhttps://www.alieward.com/ologies/somnology\n\n(Congrats on 20 months btw, good work! Sleep hygeine is one of the most important and neglected mental health/self care tools. My brain has gotten much less sucky since I got it on a sleep schedule)",

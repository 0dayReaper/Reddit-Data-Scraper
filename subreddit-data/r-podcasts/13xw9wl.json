    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019ve gotten into TTRPG (table-top roleplaying game) podcasts lately, but I struggle to find ones that I really like. I love \u201cAn Unpredicted Party\u201d by Don Marshall (set in Middle-Earth), and I\u2019ve heard a little bit of Dice for Brains (set in the Star Wars universe) and I like it quite a lot. Does anyone happen to have any suggestions for a fun TTRPG podcast which is set in one of these universes, or the Game of Thrones universe? Would love to hear it \ud83d\ude03",

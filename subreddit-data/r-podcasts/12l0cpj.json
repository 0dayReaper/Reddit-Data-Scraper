So far it was an interview with someone whose dad worked there \u2014 some of the facts were interesting but no idea how dark it\u2019ll get. Different narrator than usual on the off chance you\u2019ve listened and don\u2019t dig the guy\u2019s voice (he\u2019s not my favorite)",

There is a secondary show that focuses only on the tales Disney has turned into movies. Sorry the name of that one escapes me, but it's the same network.",

    "postText": "Ok I just need to know if anyone recognizes this horror/thriller storyline podcast. I listened to it when I was younger but can\u2019t find it anymore and no idea what it\u2019s call. I can only remember bits and pieces. The few things I remember was the main character being a male and female. They were searching for something and found this creepy place, I can\u2019t remember if it was a building or underground. But they were being chased and had to split up at some point. It\u2019s was like a pov story not like a documentary style(so different than black tapes) I really can\u2019t remember much more than that. I listened to it in like 2018-2019 and I listened on pandora. Please help me",

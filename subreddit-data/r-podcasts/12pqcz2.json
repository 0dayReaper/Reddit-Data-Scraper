    "postText": "Hello! I teach a writing class for college students, and I'd like to do a unit in which we make podcasts. I'm looking for some examples of great episodes I can get my students to listen to as inspiration. \n\nThe important thing is that it has to be a single voice offering an *argument* or at least *a particular insight* into something. So it can't just be documentary journalism, and it can't be a conversation (I used to use Malcolm Gladwell's *Revisionist History,* but I'm looking for something a bit better).\n\nIt'd be good, too, if it's a self-contained episode and it's on a subject that college-age people would be interested in. It doesn't have to be on a heavy or serious topic, but it can be. \n\nThanks in advance!",

There\u2019s a back catalog of 250+ episodes, and with the exception of a few interview episodes scattered throughout, it\u2019s a solo podcast where the host does a deep-dive into a specific topic. The subject matter ranges from light-hearted (mall culture, sorority culture, American Girl dolls, etc.) to serious (purity culture, reproductive rights, etc.)",

            "comment": "Economic Update is a weekly podcast by a Marxist economics professor about current events. The first half of each episode is usually a summary of the week's events through a decidedly biased leftist lens. Professor Wolff is always advocating for things like worker co-ops and other leftist ideals. The 4/3 episode The Marxist Tradition is a good example, a brief summary of Marxism and an argument in its favor. It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea, but approachable enough to resonate with college-age folks, one way or another.",

So\u2026 fast-forward a few weeks \u2014 yeah, not kidding. They double their prices. Cancelling, but want to try out Overcast, and perhaps purchase premium.\n\nI\u2019ve used it a little. How do you recommend configuring? Is there any documentation on it, and do you have any tips, tricks, etc.?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I feel you OP! Even though Overcast has been my app of choice for years, just last week I downloaded close to 15 podcast apps and spent *hours* tinkering with them. The majority don\u2019t really have documentation so it\u2019s a lot of trial and error. :(\n\nIt would help us to know what kind of podcasts you listen too. For example someone who downloads a 20 episode horror podcast (or seasons of a show) to binge is going to use the app differently than someone who listens to 20 daily or weekly news podcasts. I\u2019m in the second group\u2026 Hope that makes sense?\n\nAlso, what didn\u2019t you like about the native apple app? With that info we can direct you too the cool bits of overcast you\u2019ll find useful. :)\n\nHere are my basic Overcast tips:\n- Overcast has 3 particularly amazing features: playlists, the most in depth Siri r/shortcuts support I\u2019ve seen, and their smart speed. Make sure to check them out. \n- Go through and change settings, use the app for a bit, and change them again as things that annoy you come up. This is frustrating because it takes a bit to calibrate but it\u2019s totally worth it once you do!\n- If you generally consume stuff right as it\u2019s released having an icon showing you have a show or two ready might be thrilling and wonderful to you\u2026. If you don\u2019t then turn off the apps notification badge so your 700 waiting episodes don\u2019t stress you out. lol.\n- Last but not least; keep in mind that Overcast is owned, operated, and maintained by a single awesome dude. That means mom and pop level of support, not Walmart. He\u2019s awesome and so is the app but there\u2019s pros and cons of supporting a small biz vs the mega corporations like Pocket Casts (still an AWESOME app) that gets bought and sold regularly.",

                    "comment": "I listen to some news Podcasts, special interest series, Documentaries and sport-related. Some of them are daily. I listen to NPR News Now daily, and learned when using PocketCasts that it is an hourly podcast, however Apple only publishes, or seems to only make available one a day. So I thought it was daily! I was so mad when I went to PocketCasts thinking it was broken. So I redirected my anger at Apple :) This same podcast would always stop working on Podcasts, so I would regularly have to unsub/resub. Then when looking at feature-rich alternatives I realized that Podcasts is the app living under a rock while everyone else is racing around the track in Formula1 Race cars!\n\nThanks for all of your tips! I am trying to find if there is a way to automatically add a new item to a queue, but it is okay if that feature isn't there. I got used to it with PocketCasts, so was hoping that would be in Overcast; crossing fingers I haven't configured it correctly....\n\nAgain, thank you so much!",

In the settings I\u2019ve set the app to download X# of new episodes of each podcast that are automatically added to the playlist. Then in the morning I just click play the news and it plays them. Does that help?\n\n(This was pretty specific but I\u2019ve got like 30 playlists. Lol. I have one for: my current favorite 5, garden related, tech related, ones that are just chatty, and so forth. I like to kinda listen by theme if that makes sense. :) )",

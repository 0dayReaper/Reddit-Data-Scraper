This most recent episode ran 6 minutes long! I just wish we\u2019d get more story and less Terry. Please.",

I always just took it as an homage. \n\nAnd also, the sound design in the stories is my favorite! I always loved Let's Not Meet, but being an audio guy, I was instantly hooked with RR's sounds.

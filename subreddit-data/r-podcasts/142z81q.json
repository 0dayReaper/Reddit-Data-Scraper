    "postText": "I just want a hard sci-fi writing podcast. But google has utterly failed me.\n\nI can't find any writing podcasts that are ONLY about writing science fiction. I'm specifically looking for a podcast about writing HARD science fiction. So, no FTL, no artificial gravity, no reactionless drives, no violating the laws of physics. Just a podcast about science and fiction and how the two relate. Something like the Artifexian youtube channel, about science based world-building and exploration of social issues that result from specific technologies that are possible in our near future. Artifexian has a podcast, yes, but one of the two hosts HATES hard science fiction, and likes fantasy exclusively. I am trying to find a podcast ONLY about hard science fiction writing, but all I can find are podcasts reading science fiction, sci-fi audio dramas, or writer podcasts full of people who HATE hard sci-fi or constantly talk about fantasy.\n\nI just want a hard sci-fi writing podcast. Can anyone please help me?",

    "postText": "This was one of the first podcasts I downloaded owing to the fact that I had read Dan's column, Savage Love, for years growing up. Ever since day one (which was 2008 or 2009 I believe) he and the team have put out funny and informative content every week. Every. Damn. Week. How do they do it!? I think it's partly the fact that the format lends itself to recording ahead and banking some episodes, plus callers never cease to have interesting questions. \n\nI gladly paid for the Magnum version of the podcast when that became available in 2013; the first podcast I ever paid for. They keep adding value to the podcast, and try different segments or ways of presenting things that always keep it interesting. \n\nHere's to another 15 years!\n\n[Savage Lovecast](https://savage.love/)\n\nPS we need flair tag for \"advice and relationships\"",

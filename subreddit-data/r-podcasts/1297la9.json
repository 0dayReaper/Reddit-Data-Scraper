    "postText": "The pod was a history focused pod that told weird or funny history stories. The episodes were hosted by the same two male comedians. Each episode, one of the hosts would tell the other the historical story to the other, where the one not telling the story knew nothing about the story being told. Episodes were usually an hour plus in length. I distinctly recall listening to this podcast around 2017. I\u2019d really appreciate if someone could name the show for me. Several of the episodes I distinctly remember focused on the owner of dominos (along with the story of him delivering pizza to the white Sox stadium via helicopter during the World Series) and how San Francisco was developed to keep minorities out of affluent areas.",

            "comment": "The Adam and Joe show was a radio show on BBC Radio 6 music that was also a podcast (without the music). It was the only podcast I listened to for a couple of years - I got my spoken word from BBC Radio 4 and the World Service. (They started on Radio X, I still haven't listened to the archive of that.) There wasn't the same amount of podcast cross-pollination back in the day as there is now, so it took me a while to get into podcasts beyond Adam and Joe (I can't remember the second podcast I listened to).\n\nI liked the comedy, the friendship, and the audience participation. It's why I like podcasts that are also radio shows like Ed Gamble and Matthew Crosby, Elis and John. \n\nSongwars (by Adam and Joe) is one of the best podcast segments ever. They had a theme, would go away and come back the next week with a song they made on Garage Band to try and beat the other person. Emotions ran high, stakes were low. Joe Cornish was recently on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast RHLSTP (rehelestepeh!!) and talked about the radio show and how obsessed they were with competing with each other. Also some of the double act dynamics, but with a love for his former comedy wife Adam Buxton.",

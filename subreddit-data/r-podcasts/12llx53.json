He asks the right questions and has such a soothing, empathetic voice.  And at the end of the show there is a bonus listener story for about 5 minutes.  Listeners are invited to call in and tell their short story.  In fact, my story was told at the end of one episode.",

I just realized most of my phone time is podcast listening \ud83d\ude05\n\nCorporate Gossip for a fun chatty insider scoop by a brother sister team on how those with the purse strings really don't know what they're doing and all the internal messiness\n\nShameless Acquisition Target for this really honest take on the perils of working hard for other people's enterprise and taking the reigns, specific to \"big podcasting\". It does have ads but in an ironic way, in that the host is transparently trying to be picked up. It's funny and really great.\n\n\n6 Degrees of Cats which I named in another thread is a new cat themed podcast but it's not talking about their pets, it's about human topics as they relate to cats. Funny host with puns and really interesting guests so far.\n\nKind of not a secret but Normal Gossip is fun to listen to as well. It's a hit and i think has ads depending on how you listen but not used as some product marketing vehicle.\n\nLove this thread thanks !",

            "comment": "[Off Book](https://art19.com/shows/off-book) - An improvised musical podcast. Most episodes follow a format where the two hosts and a guest (with the help of some studio musicians) improvise a full Broadway-style musical on the spot. It's an incredibly entertaining show and it always blows my mind to hear the stuff they come up with on a dime. They were a Stitcher podcast for their first few years, but they went independent in early 2021 and they've been doing their own thing ever since.  \n  \n[1867 And All That](https://www.1867allthat.com/) - A podcast that covers Canadian history with a heavy focus on the fight for responsible government and (eventually) independence from Great Britain. It's extraordinarily well-researched and covers parts of Canadian history that even many Canadians are unfamiliar with. It's also a very engaging listen that ends up being a lot more entertaining than you might expect based on the subject matter.  \n  \n[The Chinese Lore Podcast](https://chineselore.com/) - This is actually several podcasts, each being a retelling of a famous work of classical Chinese literature. The first covers The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the second covers The Water Margin, and the third (now ongoing) covers the Investiture of the Gods. The host tells the stories in a very funny, entertaining, and accessible way while also including tons of historical and cultural context that would otherwise be lost on many listeners. I really can't recommend this one strongly enough. The Water Margin is my personal favourite, but Romance is also excellent and Investiture is shaping up to be one hell of a ride as well.  \n  \n[From an Island](https://audioboom.com/channels/5044626-from-an-island) - An extremely short (less than an hour in length) audio drama about a man living in a 1984-inspired UK that has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. It's technically affiliated with a podcast company called Fuelled by Coffee, but as best as I can tell it appears to basically be a one-man operation with very few shows, so I think it counts. This is a real hidden gem of a show and given the short length, I think pretty much anyone ought to give it a listen.  \n  \n[I Found a Wormhole](https://www.ifoundawormhole.com/) - Another short audio drama, this one about a woman who discovers a portal to another world in a little-used public restroom. It's less than 90 minutes of content altogether and very well-made, so I'd strongly recommend checking it out.  \n  \n[Kingdom of Stonetree Broadcasting](https://kstb-kingdom-of-stonetree-broadcasting.castos.com/) - Ever wondered what commercial radio would sound like in a generic fantasy kingdom? Wonder no more! I barely ever hear anyone mention this show and it's extremely good. Very short episodes as well, so it's easy to fit one or two in whenever you have time.",

The hosts are husband and wife, and they engage with listeners on all the social media's. The subject matter can be very heavy or light and fun. It's just nice to listen to.\n\nMarveling at Marvel's Marvels is, obviously, about the Marvel comics. One guy tells the second guy about a comic character, but he has no idea about any of the comics. The third guy moderates them. Even if you're not a comic book fan, you'll enjoy their banter and friendly discussions.",

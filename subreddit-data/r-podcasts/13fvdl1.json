Please recommend specific episodes too!\n\nAdditionally, in light of all the discussion about whether CNN was platforming Donald Trump by giving him a town hall this week, I'm particularly interested in debates about platforming and free speech. Thanks in advance.",

He\u2019s a streamer who debates people on political and social issues live on Twitch and uploads the debates to Youtube. The debates are videos but the visuals are usually irrelevant (sometimes he plays video games while debating). He\u2019s famous for keeping his calm against unreasonable or aggressive debaters. \n\nSome of my favorites:[immigration debate](https://youtu.be/AhYXZtCaSng) and a hilariously absurd [masculinity debate](https://youtu.be/Nvi1wJGI7aE)",

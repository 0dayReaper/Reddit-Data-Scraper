    "postText": "I saw a reference recently to the German Labour Front. Basically the nazi party destroyed trade unions and replaced it with their own corrupt union, which they used to gain power. I was never interested in the military/war part of world war 1-2, but I find this fascinating. i'd like to learn more about the tactics the nazi party used to gain power before the war. can anyone recommend a podcast/audiobook/documentary?",

He took the actual records kept by the Germans and does an amazing job of blending \"reenactments\" with commentary. I simply loved it.\n\nContent-wise, it tells the story of what lead up to the start of World War Two, covering lots of things that I never learned in history class. Listen. It's worth it.\n\n[https://howtostartawar.podbean.com](https://howtostartawar.podbean.com)",

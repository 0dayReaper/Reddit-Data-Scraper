    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a strange use case and I'm hoping to get some suggestions.\n\nI subscribe to over 600 podcasts and obviously I'm not listening to every episode of every podcast...\n\nWhat I currently do is use Overcast to create a \"smart playlist\" that lists all new episodes in a single playlist, and then add the episodes I want to listen to into a more manageable playlist.  It's essentially an RSS feed for all of my subscriptions and allows me to sample new shows or only listen to episodes that specifically interest me (like a review for a specific movie or a discussion of a specific news topic).\n\nHowever, because of the way Overcast lists every single episode of every single subscription in my smart playlist, there are now over 8000 episodes in that playlist which is causing it to crash.  I've been trying to search for a solution that does something similar, but I haven't been able to find anything that has a 'list all new episodes' feature and also the ability to create custom playlists.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only person who listens to podcasts this way, but if anyone has any ideas it would be appreciated. \n\nHeck, at this point I'm willing to use a desktop app to check for new episodes and then manually add them to my podcast app if that's the only way to do what I'm looking for.\n\nThanks!\n\ntl;dr\n\n* I subscribe to 600+ podcasts.\n* I'd like to find a way to see the new episodes from each podcast that updates regularly to select the specific new episodes I want to listen to.\n* Overcast has been great, but has become unstable because I have too many episodes in my 'new episodes' playlist.\n* Looking for any app suggestions or workflows.",

I just have a few podcasts subscribed to, but it's listing 6500 episodes without skipping a beat.\n\nI have 3 playlists: 1 must-listen list which automatically adds and downloads for specific few podcasts; one backlog list, which I manually add to and download (selected from the built-in episodes list); and then the built-in episodes list.\n\nWith 600 podcasts though, I'd be curious to know how many episodes you'd have. I barely scratch 20!",

Or are the playlists static and only display things in the order you put things into them?\n\nIt may be a feature I took for granted, but it could be something I live without in place of an app that works...\n\nAlso, is there an easy way to delete downloads manually without going into each podcast/show, or is the only option using the settings in Downloads to delete an episode after you finish an episode?\n\nThanks again. :)",

It\u2019s incredibly easy to see all of them and it\u2019s possible to have a download instead of a play button (I use downloads as my \u201cto listen\u201d-list). Sadly it has gotten kinda expensive for people that haven\u2019t been grandfathered in, but this could very well be a free feature anyways.",

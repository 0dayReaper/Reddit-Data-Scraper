It\u2019s a great show and I honestly was surprised by their amazing guest list.  If you need some funny in your life, check this podcast out.",

But I try to imagine them just hangin out at a diner just busting each others balls and trying to make each other laugh, hence the title \u201cfly in the wall\u201d.  Not as a formal interview, where we will learn some deep secrets of the guest, but More of a conversation between 3 colleagues.  But I can see your point",

Dana was on my generation\u2019s elite snl guys, so I grew up idolizing him.   So I enjoy his Impersonations and schtick, but can see how he can bothersome if you don\u2019t really know his style",

She brought up some really crappy stuff that happened when she was on SNL - making less money than others, Lorne ignoring her, not getting on the show - and Carvey and Spade just completely failed to respond beyond a few \u201cwow, that sucks\u201d kind of statements. It felt really yucky. \n\nI realize that it\u2019s a comedy show, but the least they could have done was acknowledge that as two white dudes, their experience on the show may have been different from the women and people of color.",

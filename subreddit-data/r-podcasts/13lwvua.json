I am looking for\n\n* pleasent voice / recording quality (voice is personal preference, I know)\n* long episodes (&gt;1h per episode)\n* multiple short or medium length stories per episode\n* either creepy pasta or user submitted stories of good quality\n* optional: ideally already large count of released episode\n\nCan be English (doesn't matter if US, UK, AU,...) or German language.\n\nThank you for your suggestions =)",

IIRC Jim Harold was a guest in the Lets Read podcast, and I really enjoyed his narration, but I'm not familiar with his podcast, per se.\n\nThe host of Let's Not Meet, Andrew Tate, also has another pod, **Odd Trails**. I'd recommend that if you want some paranormal stories. It has another host too, can't remember his name though, who is also an excellent narrator.\n\nAnd of course, the podcast with the largest backlog; **No Sleep**. Those stories can be a bit of a hit-or-miss, but generally speaking, most of them are good. The narration is also superb.\n\n**Radio Rental** has some good episodes, and by that I mean the older ones. The newer ones are a bit meh.",

The stories are great, host as well, but perhaps because I've listened to Let's Read first, it is still my favorite. \n\nOh... I just realized (because you wrote it) that Let's Not Meet is from Andrew Tate. I don't want to start a whole discussion here, but I think I'll actually unsub that one. \n\nThe Let's Read Host was also a guest on Jim Harold's Campfire. That's how I discovered it.\n\nBut yeah, thanks for your suggestions, I have now a huge backlog of episodes to check out :)",

They don't number their episodes but according to podbean there's nearly 200 eps.  They upload on a weekly basis and have good audio quality.",

I wanted to chime in with one no one has mentioned yet. \u2018Darek Weber Scary Stories\u2019 is very similar to \u2018The Let\u2019s Read Podcast\u2019. It seems to be evolving a bit. The most recent episode is 2hrs 45mins, older ones are about 30mins. The stories are currently read over a background of lo-fi or rain. Worth a listen.",

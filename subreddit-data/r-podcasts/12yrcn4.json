For instance, if I'm going to visit a place like Austin, Colombia, Italy, London, etc...it would be neat to be able to listen to podcasts about that specific area. I haven't seen this sort of tool out there before.",

The industry pretty much follows their RSS guideline ([https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts\\_connect/#/itcb54353390](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)). This guideline doesn't include country, so your request might not be feasible.   \n\n\nThey do have a language tag though, so it's possible to make an app based on that. That's the closest thing to this idea that I can think of.",

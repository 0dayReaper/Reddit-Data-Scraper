    "postText": "I'm not making fun, I'm just genuinely looking for Answers. My commute isn't that long, just considerably hectic because too many people and also because I've to interchange trains. So, I cannot listen to podcast in peace. Other than that, my brain cannot focus on two things at one time. Suppose, I'm folding clothes or cleaning etc and I put on a podcast then my brain is likely to wander off to some other thing and before I know it, I've skipped some 15 mins of whatever they were saying. \nI've tried so many time to just focus on podcasts but nothing helps. Even with audiobooks, I can only manage to listen with attention if I'm simultaneously reading the copy of that same book. Even though video podcasts, that I like are few, I just put on the subtitle and I'm able to focus on it a bit. \nBut pls help me what I can do about this situation. There are so many podcasts I want to listen to. \nThanks.",

            "comment": "tl;dr - Start with \"easy listens\" and work your way up to whatever you want to listen to\n\nAuditory comprehension is a skill that needs to be developed, just like reading comprehension. You can't take a random adult who doesn't read novels regularly and expect them to sit through Tolstoy, can you?\n\nStart with simple podcasts - conversational ones, where it's mostly a few people shooting the shit. Where it doesn't matter if you miss a few bits and pieces here and there - it's all just silly fun and background chatter anyway. Or something where you already know all the details - like a favourite book, or if you follow a sport, maybe a podcast around the sport/league. I started with [My Dad Wrote A Porno](https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/). Listen to it during commutes and chores. You *will* miss bits - but context isn't all that important in these sorts of podcasts (or you already know the details). Just train yourself to listen. It's okay if you find yourself rewinding frequently or you zoned out for half an hour and have no clue what happened in the last episode. Just keep listening and relistening - so your brain gets used to things\n\nThen move on to podcasts about subjects you have *some* knowledge about - I moved to [The History of Rome](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/). I still wasn't *great* at paying attention and comprehending what I'm hearing - but because I knew the broad strokes, I was able to keep up with things. \n\nAs I made my way through that and other podcasts on familiar-ish topics, my auditory comprehension increased and I could branch out to more unfamiliar topics. But it still had to be a gradual curve though. It took me more than 5 years before I could actually listen to literary fiction audiobooks and such. \n\nAnd even now, 7+ years in, where I listen to everything at least at 1.5x speed, I am *still* a better reader than I am a listener - so if I need to absorb really complex information, or do it on a deadline, I can't do it via audio. Which is not surprising - I have been a bookworm for far longer.",

I had to try different things to determine which would make me space out. Examples: play a video game on mute that you're already very familiar with or have beaten before. Doodle or write words related to the story you're hearing, or patterns like stripes, circles, etc. Play a simple puzzle game like a match 3. Go for a walk alone, farther than usual. \n\nAside from trial and error when it comes to activities, it's worth seeing if any of the podcasts that you prefer have transcripts.  Most dont but some do. Also, see if the podcast has a video version. Some have both audio as well as audio + video formats, usually video versions are on youtube. The last tip I have is do play with the speed. I love science podcasts, but for whatever reason I absorb them better at .75 or 1.5 speed, not normal speed. Normal speed is too slow to absorb naturally but too fast to ponder thoroughly. I can go either way but normal speed is intolerable. \n\nGood luck!",

I started listening to podcasts with SYSK when their episodes were 5-10 minutes long, and gradually started listening to longer and longer podcasts, and eventually audiobooks. Similarly, I had to build up to more complex topics in audio format; for example, I can only listen to YA fiction in audio format, even though I read written fiction at a college level.  \n\nSo, my advice would be to build up slowly to longer form audio content. Maybe set a timer on your phone for 5-10 minutes at first, then increase to 15, 20, 30 min, etc. until you're at the level you want to be at. Also, start with audio content that's lower than your normal reading level, then work your way up.",

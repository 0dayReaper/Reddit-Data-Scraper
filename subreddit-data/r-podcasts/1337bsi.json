I\u2019m thinking the podcast version of the daily show, colbert report, or last week tonight with John Oliver. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the bugle and it wasn\u2019t for me just a tad too british haha",

He usually is talking with his writers and/or producers that worked on it, their takes, research, etc but then they do start talking about everyday things for a bit. It then usually ends with him talking with an expert (that wasn\u2019t on the tv show) about the matter for the last 20min. Jon is a great interviewer so the interviews are pretty solid to learn things. I just wish it was more regular but it just runs pretty parallel to each season so far.",

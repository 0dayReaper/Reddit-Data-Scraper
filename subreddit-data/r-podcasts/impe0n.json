A group of (really capable) people had to dedicate their skills and life-energy for one man to get justice! A worthy endeavor but still!\n\nBut, back to the joy: (some) justice! 23 years, locked in a box, but now he\u2019s free. Real justice would be the state of Mississippi now giving him a nice chunk of change, an apology from Doug Evans, and then leaving him and his family alone.",

That\u2019s the other side of over zealous prosecution, they get blinders punish the wrong person and the real perp goes free. It\u2019s a lose lose except for the prosecutor who gets another \u201cwin\u201d in this terribly rigged game. Happy for Curtis and his family and kudos to In the Dark and the lawyers (and the Supreme Court) for finally saying enough is enough.",

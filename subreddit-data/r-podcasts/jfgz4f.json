The series will feature the original  theme music, a narrator and interviews with individuals involved in the  cases as well as a call out for more information.\n\nThe *Unsolved Mysteries* podcast will be executive produced by  Chris Corcoran, Chief Content Officer of Cadence13, and Terry Dunn  Meurer, the co-creator of *Unsolved Mysteries*, and will be co-directed and co-produced by\u00a0Cadence13 and\u00a0Cosgrove/Meurer Productions.\n\nNetflix\u2019s revival of *Unsolved Mysteries* initially launched  in July and has been produced in association with Stranger  Things\u00a0EP\u00a0Shawn Levy\u00a0and his company\u00a021 Laps Entertainment in  association with Cosgrove/Meurer Productions.\n\nThe series, which was originally hosted by Robert Stack and ran for  over 500 episodes between 1987 and 2010, previously aired on NBC between  1987 and 1997 and CBS picked it up for two years after it was  cancelled. Lifetime aired a number of new episodes in 2001/2002 and  Spike also picked it up between 2008 and 2010 with Dennis Farina  replacing Stack following\u00a0*The Untouchables*\u00a0actor\u2019s death in 2003.\n\nThe podcast will launch in early 2021.\n\n\u201cCosgrove/Meurer Productions is thrilled to be partnering with  Cadence13 to present all new unsolved mysteries to podcast listeners,\u201d  said Terry Dunn Meurer, co-creator and executive producer, *Unsolved Mysteries*, Cosgrove/Meurer Productions. \u201cThere are an incredible number of cases that we hope to solve through the podcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, and a great opportunity, to partner with one of the  strongest and most credible and successful brands in television history  to create original content for the podcast space,\u201d said Chris Corcoran,  Chief Content Officer, Cadence13. \u201cOur objective at C13 continues to be  focused on best-in-class content, and this is a special one we\u2019re proud  to add to our premium-focused roster.\u201d",

I have not seen a single thing produced on Netflix that makes sense as a podcast I\u2019ve seen podcasts that make sense to translate the other direction.\n\nETA: downvote all you want but the version of UM on Netflix is fine but it\u2019s already suffered a massive downgrade from the original format even if the production values are more 2020. The podcasts they attach to now aren\u2019t any good so I doubt this one will be either. Plus they are basically stealing audiences from the actual podcasts world. Netflix nor UM needs to be involved in podcasting and secretly people who listen to podcasts know this already.",

    "postText": "My personal favorite is Obscura True Crime Podcast. Justin manages to cover extremely graphic stuff while remaining respectful. The Black Label episodes are something I look forward to each month and each one feels like something special. \n\nHere's the thing:\n\nThis is surprisingly hard to find in the true crime genre. MOST of the hosts turn out to be garbage.  Any suggestions are mighty welcome. And I mean that. I could use any that are well produced, graphic, and respectful.",

I have never heard so much suffering from a person and to have found out that it was a kid! \n\nI can\u2019t afford to subscribe to get all the Black Label but sometimes I think that\u2019s a good thing. Despite listening to a LOT of true crime, there are still some that makes me really sick.\n\nI agree. I really like Justin\u2019s voice and the way he talks. \n\nYou may also like \u201cThis is Monsters.\u201d The host does have a somewhat monotone voice but the content is so horrifying you definitely will not be tempted to doze off. I\u2019d advise googling the cases for the first season before listening to them because it focuses on the murder of children and some of them are TERRIBLE.",

True crime podcasts are a dime a dozen, but Killer Psyche gets into the psychology of terrible crimes and attempts to understand the why of the criminals. Others I've heard so far just narrate a case or \"investigate\" an old cold case, but hardly ever find anything new, let alone close the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know others like Killer Psyche, let me know! Thanks!",

Sword and Scale is a true crime podcast that covers some of the most heinous crimes in history, including serial killers, mass murderers, and cult leaders.

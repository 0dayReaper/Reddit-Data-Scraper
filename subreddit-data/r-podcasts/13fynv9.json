    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nThis is a bit vague, but I remember vaguely reading in my local (Belgian) newspaper late last or early this year about an upcoming podcast where a well known investigative journalist/podcaster was going to release a series about the booming \"Life Coach\" and \" Wellness coaching\" industry.\n\nI was quite intrigued but forgot basically all the details so am not able to find it. I do recall the release date was somewhere April/May, so I'm hoping it';s out or will be soon. \n\nDoes this even remotely ring a bell for someone? If you can share your thoughts, or good podcasts that seem to fit the above mold, I'd be extremely grateful!",

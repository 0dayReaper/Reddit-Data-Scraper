    "postText": "These days we hear about a lot of people having thousands of listens per episode and how fast their podcast is grown (absolutely nothing wrong with sharing that). But I want to take a moment and give a virtual high five to the podcasters who continuously release new episode even when they only have a handful of listeners.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that even if an episode only get 1 listener, there's a possibility that your episode just made that person's day a whole lot better.\n\nIn a day and age where we focus on the number of followers and listens we shouldn't forget that those listeners are real people who enjoy your podcast and listen to it for multiple reason, whether its to help them get through a hard day, have a few laughs, relax or anything else. I might get some heat for this but as a podcaster I believe that I owe it to my listeners (no matter how many listens) to create content where they can walk away with new information, some laughs and anything that will improve their current situation.\n\nI understand that some people stop podcasting because other priorities come first and that's completely understandable and I'm not bashing you in anyway (thank you for releasing some episodes).\n\nAnyways, to those who keep releasing new episode regardless of the number of listeners they get, are the real MVPs.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that a lot of podcast don't make it pass the 10th episode (I wish I can find that article). If anyone knows of it please share it. \n\nEdit1 : As most people mentioned, the most important thing is to make sure you enjoy doing your podcast and I completely agree with that. Sorry I missed that point. Have a great day.\n\nEdit2 Here's the link I was talking about  thanks to /u/[Janmmurphy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Janmmurphy/) for finding it.\n\n[https://www.amplifimedia.com/blogstein/2018/8/22/how-many-of-the-550000-podcasts-are-actually-active](https://www.amplifimedia.com/blogstein/2018/8/22/how-many-of-the-550000-podcasts-are-actually-active)",

They also don't seem to enjoy performing, but they are addicted to the idea of being a comedian and the very very rare occasional adrenaline rush of getting maybe a laugh for one joke.\n\nWhen I see podcasts that continue for years despite having only 100 listeners I probably accidentally apply that same lens to that situation - I think, why are they doing this podcast, they're not doing well at all. But that's probably a very flawed way to look at things. People can sit around and talk to their friends on microphones for fun and that's fine, that's enough!",

Shortly after we began three years ago, another podcast started that had the exact same format and subject matter as us, but their first episode had more listeners than we'd ever gotten in like two months and they got bigger and bigger.\n\nIt's tough being a small podcast, but like I said, I'm doing this because I want to do it, not because I expected to get famous.

Since signing with acast, they've changed what a 'listen' actually is to bring it in line across the industry to promote transparency and ease for advertisers. Before that it was counting about 1,200 and 1,400.\n\nSo by basically having half the numbers, even though I know the parameters have changed, it means that I've lost a bit of the enthusiasm. It's also hard to find the time to write, research, record and edit whilst having a full time job, a 3 hour commute, and 2 young kids.\n\nHowever, I still try and get an episode a week up, but finding it much more difficult. I think the 10 episodes make sense. But as people have said here, it's got to be fun.\n\nI'm not having as much fun as I did have, and I feel a lot of the audience have moved on. I also feel like dipping my toes into producing other podcast series have fallen flat. So at a bit of a crossroads as I should be focusing my attention to other things, but if I take a break again, I know I will lose even more of my audience.\n\nI'm kinda just thinking out loud sorry. But yes, please make sure it's always fun, if it doesn't get the numbers then don't worry. I've got a bit of 'the numbers ' and if anything I've enjoyed it less.\n\nIf you think it's a get rich and famous thing, then don't bother. If it's enjoyable, do it. Why not? All my creative endeavours are because they are just fun to do and they will be around forever. Just enjoy it and stop if you want to stop!",

(monthly)   \nWe love just doing it to be honest, and despite sometimes with a full time job kids and general life it can be a push with what we do for the podcast, we still manage to get it out.   \n\n\nThere was one episode we had to record 3 separate times and had to record in a totally new way the third time due to issues with the tech and such. Ended up on recording editing and publishing on the last day we could to get it up on the right month.",

We don't have much money between us at all so advertising and expensive equipment are just not an option for us. We have fun with what we do have though!",

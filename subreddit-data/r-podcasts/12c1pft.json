    "postText": "I\u2019m a weirdo. I love a number of strange podcasts and have wanted an alien podcast that researched the real historical moments that are intriguing, while maintaining some skepticism. I\u2019m tired of the people who go into them with overt skepticism or religious zeal. It\u2019s just tiring.\n\nThis podcast is done by some guy from the NYT (allegedly he\u2019s a true crime guy?). The production is unreal, the interviews are solid, the story itself is great. I\u2019ve never signed up for a network, but I paid the five dollars to binge this show. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an interesting podcast that touches on the moments in US history or in our current events dealing with AFP or UFOs or whatever the hell you want to call them, this is as good as I\u2019ve listened to.",

It's making massive leaps and declarative statements without any actual evidence,other than some sketchy eye witnesses",

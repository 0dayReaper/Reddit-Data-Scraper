The episodes on Gary Young who started Young Living, the essential oils MLM, and also an episode about The Liver King and his associated diet. Sounds Like A Cult also has some episodes that remind me of Maintenance Phase style debunking such as Diet Culture, Goop, and some exercise focused ones like Soulcycle, CrossFit etc.",

Initially mostly about Bigfoot, but it's got a quite broad range of topic including zombie ants, homunculi, cannibalism and monsters on maps. Two hosts with a knowledgeable guest. \n\nArchy Fantasies goes into dodgy archeological claims. Ancient Aliens, giants, that sort of thing. Seems to be no longer updated, though the main host might still be active on YT. \n\nIn Research Of goes deep into the actual science behind the claims jn each episode of the 1970's Nimoy-presented In Search Of. Presented by one of the hosts from MonsterTalk and one of the hosts (or very frequent guests, not entirely sure) of Archy Fantasies.",

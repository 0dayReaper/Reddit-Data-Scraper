It doesn't have a framework like Teacher's Lounge, but it's pretty good, and there are a lot of episodes. I don't think they did a great job cross-promoting that one.\n\nThere are also whole new seasons of Teacher's Lounge available for sale on their website. \n\nHave you also tried Superego? One of the OG improv podcasts. I think most of it is behind a paywall, but it does have a framework of sorts, and it's really good.",

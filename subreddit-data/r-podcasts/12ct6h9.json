    "postText": "I am looking for a podcast that's about regular people that are just starting their journey.\n\nI find the health, fitness, optimization, and business topics of the Tim Ferris show fascinating, but for me the guests are unrelatable. I'm not interested in hearing from people that have built billion-dollar companies or ran 240km in 48 hours. I want to hear from people who are just a few steps ahead, that day-to-day lead ordinary lives.\n\nI imagine a lot of the guests would consider themselves ordinary people. So perhaps I mean people that aren't famous and have not got a book to sell. Just people that do amazing things in between their day job and looking after children.",

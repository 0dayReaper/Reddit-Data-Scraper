For example right now he's learning how to sound sh sounds and differentiating (sell vs. shell).\nI am just looking for kid friendly podcasts that would help us practice words and sentences together in the car. Thank you so much!",

There\u2019s a big focus on emotional development etc, but it\u2019s also very funny",

If you are open to games, an SLP friend of mine told me about a speech therapy app she uses with her kids at work called [Fluency Friends](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fluency-friends-speech-game/id1605150818).  Based on what she told me, kids will learn different techniques and I think it might cover what you're looking for. There's apparently a story element too that the kids she worked with really love, I hope it helps!",

            "comment": "Speech therapist here.\n\nPodcasts are a good idea but something that might be even better is songs. Songs are very repetitive and the music can help your son stay engaged. If he\u2019s still in his car seat, you can find a baby car mirror and install it somewhere in front of him so he can watch himself while he\u2019s singing. You can practice exaggerating your faces to make the proper sound with him and get tips from your speech therapist on his specific sounds to practice them with him in the car.\n\nAs far as songs, you can look at songs on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. for kids\u2019 songs and listen to them and see if they have the sounds your son is working on. For example, there\u2019s a song by Raffi called \u201cShake My Sillies Out\u201d which has both the /s/ and /sh/ sound your son is working on.",

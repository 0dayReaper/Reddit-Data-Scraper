I do live in an area where I have interaction with this culture and it\u2019s *complicated*. \n\nI feel like the host and the subject of the podcast are very young and I\u2019m not 100% behind the idea that she\u2019s a reliable narrator. While also having a lot of empathy for what she has been through.\n\nI appreciate your response. I have a perhaps cynical view that there is no reconciling the problems of perpetuating a culture that is mired in women carrying on so much of the labor. I\u2019ve been holding out hope the podcast will address that issue but it seems to be dancing up to that line and then dialing it back. \n\nHis lawyer sounded pretty reasonable to me, while also having to acknowledge he\u2019s a lawyer who represented the father of the children. It\u2019s not crazy IMO to think the kids\u2019 stepdad is a little worrisome given the circumstances, Romany cultural issues aside. \n\nUltimately, I feel like this pod is going to land on her side and that is completely valid. I\u2019m just not sure how these issues of hardcore gender roles and cultural preservation are to be resolved. They might be unanswerable questions and all reporting has some kind of bias.\n\nI wonder sometimes why I put myself through this but I really do appreciate your response.",

I agree that the concern about Paulina's new husband is 100% valid, and I also question how much of the story we aren't hearing.  That said, I felt that the lawyer neglected to acknowledge that a man who took his children away from their mother and hid them for three weeks, with the help of his family, should probably not be blindly trusted to act in the best interest of those children going forwards.  Of course he is going to promise that he won't pull them out of school, at this point I would not trust him to follow through with that.  \n\nThe question of cultural preservation of hardcore gender roles is of course tricky.  It was noticeable that the only people we heard interviewed who lamented the potential loss of this aspect of the culture were men.  Of course they would have a greater stake in wanting to preserve the tradition of women having little to no education or agency in their lives.",

He said something along the lines of the family supporting the children in their wishes regarding their future. Thats a whole different ballgame to \"we'll keep those 12 year olds in school no matter what\"! Because guess what my 12 year old would say if I would give her the chance to quit school? That just made my skin crawl.\n\nAs did the stepdad. 40-Something with a DV conviction (Accidentally pushed his then wife in the face? How does that even work?) latches on to a vulnerable 22 year old  \"life coach\"?\nI also think Paulina might overestimate her abilities to bullshit other people and this guy picked up on her insecurities. She also mentioned him being so entrepreneurial and how he takes care of her, so I'm sensing a bit of a power imbalance here..",

I believe that her sheltered and controlled upbringing left Paulina much more vulnerable to exploitation than perhaps she is aware of.  Would someone who genuinely had her best interests at heart rush her into another marriage so soon? It's hard to say.  Perhaps she felt that it would strengthen her case in family court if she could provide the children with a two-parent household, but if that is the case than selecting someone with a DV conviction as the other parent would not make much sense.",

I found myself thinking \u201cand so no one calls CPS\u201d when they were talking about not sending the kids to school. I so wanted the men she was interviewing to explain how they reconcile preserving their culture with the treatment of women and children, if only to reveal themselves to not have any empathy.",

The reason I get along well with my Mother in Law is because I don't live in the same house with her, and there is no power imbalance between us.

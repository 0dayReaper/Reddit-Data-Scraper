I take what I want and leave the rest behind with everyone else I can think of, but Attia is all the more pleasurable to listen to because I don\u2019t feel the need to compromise. \n\nI need to revisit Rhonda. I only know her from Rogan and I stopped listening to Rogan but I liked what I heard.",

I find that most of the really awesome experts in this field do blogs and twitter but not podcasts so much. If you're up for reading instead of listening, Nicola Guess is great ([https://drguess.substack.com/](https://drguess.substack.com/)) as is Mario Kratz ([https://nourishedbyscience.com/](https://nourishedbyscience.com/)). They both also are great to follow on twitter. Other twitter accounts I think are great: Kevin Klatt ([https://twitter.com/KCKlatt](https://twitter.com/KCKlatt)), Deirdre Tobias ([https://twitter.com/deirdre\\_tobias](https://twitter.com/deirdre_tobias)), and Kevin Hall ([https://twitter.com/KevinH\\_PhD](https://twitter.com/KevinH_PhD)).",

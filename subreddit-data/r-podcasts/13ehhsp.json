    "postText": "Is anyone else excited that monster porn podcast came back after 2 years? It was my favorite horror / comedy podcast so I saved the feed. All the sudden there are new eps.\n\nThey were supposedly taken down due to Chyna the 2003 WWE wrestler. \n\nI'm just a fan. Also looking for any similar podcasts in the horror /  comedy realm. I love \"Tales from the gas station\" with Jack Townsend.",

    "postText": "Hi r/podcasts! Are you excited to listen to the jaw-dropping season finale of [Bear Brook](https://link.chtbl.com/7vVauHuF?sid=ama) Season 2?\n\n**Join us live at 12pm (noon) ET on April 10 to ask the team behind the Bear Brook podcast about the show!**\n\n[Jason Moon](https://twitter.com/jasonmoonNHPR) (Bear Brook\u2019s award-winning host) and [Rebecca Lavoie](https://twitter.com/reblavoie) (on-demand audio director at [New Hampshire Public Radio](https://www.nhpr.org/)), will be here to answer your questions about the Bear Brook podcast, their investigation, the state of \u201ctrue crime,\u201d and beyond.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly five years since the series debut of Bear Brook, which has garnered more than 21 million downloads. Season 1, about the case that [changed how murders are investigated](https://www.bearbrookpodcast.com/season-one), led to the identification of multiple victims. Earlier this year, the team came back with Bear Brook Season 2: A True Crime Story to explore an even more complex case that many believe involved a wrongful conviction.\n\nThe new season centers on the 1988 murder of Sharon Johnson that resulted in a conviction for 19-year-old Jason Carroll. The only evidence? His own taped confession, which he claims was the result of coercion by a veteran detective \u2013 and his mother. More than 30 years later, is it possible to get to the truth and who gets to tell it?\n\nThroughout this new season (all 8 episodes are available now), they interviewed the people who continue to be profoundly impacted by this case and explore what happens when the official narrative is challenged by lawyers \u2013 and podcasters \u2013 as well as the critical impact \"true crime stories\" can have on real cases.\n\nYou can find [Bear Brook](https://link.chtbl.com/7vVauHuF?sid=ama) on your favorite podcast app.\n\nThe AMA will start at 12 noon Eastern Time ([or find your local time conversation here](https://everytimezone.com/s/25cc7702)).\n\n*(The AMA will take place on another thread, posted by our guest - not on this announcement post - so please visit Monday to leave any questions you may have over there!)*",

            "comment": "They have individual podcasts for just about every sports team in the major sports in the US, and a number of other sports related subjects. That's going to end up with a ton of content without content farming. I only listen to one team, but the hosts for that one have come across to me as well educated on the sport and the team, and generally entertaining (two hosts over the time I've listened, the first one hired away by the team to host an official team podcast). They also do crossover episodes with other teams, and some of those hosts seem great, but some seem mediocre, but that's just single episodes. And they occasionally get players (generally former players who are currently in the media) and other sports people to guest on their show. I can't think of any major news or announcement about the team that I follow that wasn't covered by their podcast in short order in the few years I've listened.\n\nPossibly, most importantly, I've seen their hosts (especially the current one) on other team and league shows that aren't connected to the Locked-On network. \n\nI will say that in the offseason, they sometimes seem a bit dry, but there's little news and thus little to analyze, so I think that's more of a characteristic of a year round daily team sportscast.\n\nMy only complaint is that I'm tired of hearing the same damned ads, especially since he's generally good at transitioning to it so I don't notice it immediately.",

Hearing they appear on other official league programs is a relatively positive sign as to there credibility",

They definitely seem like fans of the team, given the dunked celebration podcast after one big win, or a few years ago, with a really angry episode after a lazy, awful loss. And the last host of the Dolphins podcast (the one I listen to) was hired away by the team, and currently hosts podcasts for the Dolphins.\n\nIf news and analysis is what you're looking for, I'd give it a try. Their coverage of the Dolphins is the best team specific regular content that I've found (though, this is a low bar). I assume other teams are in a somewhat similar boat (the Bills guy is really good).",

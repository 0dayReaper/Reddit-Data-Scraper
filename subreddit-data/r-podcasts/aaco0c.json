One thing that is disappointing however--and this comes from someone lucky enough to be working on a show that has made the \"best of\" lists, is how this kind of look just seems to reinforce one of the biggest problems in the industry: discoverability. It may be useful to know what's on the \"best of\" lists, and aggregate that information with interesting results. There's always at least a few insights that come from an exercise like this. But IMHO this doesn't actually do anything for people who are already engaged in the medium enough to know of or have listened to all the shows on the lists (myself among them). Not meant as a brag or a criticism of the exercise itself--it just blows me away that 200 thousand shows were launched this year!! And yet all the lists are talking about the same 20 shows. Can it be that 100 percent of the audience for podcasts only needs to know about 1/10000th of the shows launched this year? Am I doing that math right? All I know is that the number of shows getting all of the attention is mighty small... And that seems great for those shows and bad for everyone else--listeners and makers alike. -Ben",

You can look for people looking for recommendations and hope they pick yours, but when you've got one person recommending their own show, and 40 people recommending serial, which do you listen to? This is also why I run a featured shows page of shows me and my cohosts listen to to promote smaller shows but also give people I talk to options to chose from. ",

In a perfect world, the coverage of podcasts--even best-of lists--would include both. Instead I feel like it's just the first kind.

He said 200k shows came out this year and nearly all on these lists are ones I listen to or ones I tried and didn't like or simply wasn't interested in. And sometimes I venture upon some podcast with barely any reviews not on any list and it's amazing. Because most podcast discovery tools are simply top 100 lists or trending which are all based off of how many others like it. And podcast ratings seem to be useless since they're all 4 stars or higher. \n\nIs there some type of netflix algorithm type tool where you can \"upvote\" or \"downvote\" podcasts and it can tell you another one you might like? \n\nOf course there is the risk that if the number of podcast listeners stays static and the amount of \"discovered\" podcasts increases, then viewership on any specific podcast will decrease and the highest production podcasts wouldn't be able to sustain themselves. I have no idea about how the money stuff works though. But there is a limit at how many podcasts can be listened to obviously by a single person. ",

Or rather, it seems to exist in tiny ways on many of the third party apps and platforms but doesn't seem to work all that well on any of them. NPR One is the example that comes to mind, but it seems most likely that Spotify will eventually crack recommendation at scale (since they're growing pod audience and they're so good at it with music). \n\nAs far as audience size, I expect it to grow for sure, but I think you're right about there being a concern among some re: audience shrinkage. To me the more likely scenario is that larger publishers and pods will only become more eclipsing while more Indy outfits will go by the wayside or struggle to gain enough audience to become sustainable in the first place.

I don't (can't) listen to most of them but I am currently subscribed to roughly 700 podcasts which is down from 1300 a month ago because I used to subscribe to anything that sounded slightly interesting. At least 100 are concluded and a good amount are audiodramas which I'm not going to touch until there are enough episodes to binge but it's still too much to listen to everything. So if you do look you can find what you want. But there are a bunch of these shows which I listen to which are very good and I am surprised they do not get more exposure or have more reviews on them.\n\n\nI'm curious how much the podcast listening audience has increased over the years. If a third of all podcasts were created this year, did a third of all subscribers start listening this year? More? Less?",

From that report looks like listenership is steadily increasing at a pretty good rate.

I tried heavyweight but thought the first episode was boring but perhaps I should try it again.\n\nIt's pretty interesting about the 200k shows launching in 2018 which is a third of all shows. It'd be interesting to see if that trend increases and by how much.\n\nI'd also be interested in seeing how many top shows each year had, and whether or not the increase in number of shows correlates to increase in number of quality shows. Of course there's only so many shows anyone can listen to so even if there were more higher quality shows than beforehand it would be difficult to tell. Is there a breakdown of  shows by their rating? \n\nI'm also a bit surpirsed This American Life and Radiolab spent less than 10 weeks in the top ten. They along with Serial have got to be the biggest podcasts I've heard of and people who don't know about podcasts usually have heard of them.  TAL looks to be top 20 consistently but Radiolab is barely Top 50. My initial guess would be that shows with set seasons that tell a story do better because you don't want to miss any day but JRE and my favorite murder don't have seasons as far as I'm aware.\n\n\nAlso notice how most of the top recomended list is made of \"serious\" podcasts. As the article says most are scripted documentary style with an investigative bent. It's obviously a great use of the medium but a bit odd the top are all so similiar. No comedy ala earwolf or news analysis but a bunch that are True Crime which is something I thought was a pretty specific genre.",

The two guys chuckling behind a microphone model of podcast is growing pretty stale overall. \n\nAnd drop everything and go listen to Heavyweight. I think it's probably the best podcast this year.",

But with LPOTL it seems you listen to them and for the first 10 minutes they just crack jokes then when they get to the information part they're constantly interrupting each other going onto random tangents. And that's not even factoring in that the humor tends to be pretty lowbrow. It's also hard to recomend a podcast when you need to add the disclaimer \"you should probably skip the first 100 episodes because before then they were much more obnoxious and did much worse research\" which I often see bandied around with LPOTL",

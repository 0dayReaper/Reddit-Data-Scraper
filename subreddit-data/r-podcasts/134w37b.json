    "postText": "Hi, I just went through a podcast that discussed some of the popular bestselling books that I could have also easily thought to be really bad works and factually incorrect too however I didn't. I just agreed to whatever was being sad in the podcast, something I also should have noticed by my own readings. \n\nI am hoping to learn about critical thinking and be a able to identify bad argument quickly. \n\nTha ks",

Start at the beginning because he left that pod over a year ago and I find it less compelling without him. \"Behind the Bastards\" is another great one. If you are interested in debunking weight loss/dietary myths, Michael Hobbs, yet again has a podcast (IMHO, his best work) called \"Maintenance Phase\".",

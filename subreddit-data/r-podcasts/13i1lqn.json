I just finished binging Up and Vanished and working through Culpable right now - I love the storytelling and investigative aspect of these. I have listened to all of Dateline and couldn\u2019t find anything suitable. \n\nI love the respect and lack of banter here. If anyone else has any that are around these topics, that are about true crime, cults, strange stuff, I\u2019m all ears.",

            "comment": "Hello everyone, I'm a sucker for a good mystery, mostly paranormal, but I feel like there aren't enough podcasts dealing with a single story, trying to investigate one mystery throughout its run. I know there are The Black Tapes (loved that one) and Tanis (got too convoluted and kinda... boring to me), so I am okay with it being a fiction podcast, but I'd prefer something that would at least try to investigate a real life mystery or a paranormal topic, just one investigation throughout the whole run or season.\n\nI really really like Hellier, but that's a youtube show, and Strange Arrivals - even when this one being a debunking type of podcast, going through a single story each season and investigating all the aspects of it.\n\nAny recommendations for me?",

The story is so unbelievable, but in a way so cruel and beautiful. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil it, but it\u2019s about the fertility industry and their exploitation and also about the abuse of power in teacher/student relationships.",

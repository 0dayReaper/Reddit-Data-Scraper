Perfect.\n\nBut then I really got into podcasts and\n\n* Their audio ads annoyed the fuck out of me. I don't know if they still do this (last time I mentioned it, an employee said they hadn't added it back to the new Android app) - but they used to play an audio ad at the end of every episode. *Stitcher* inserted the ad, it was not part of the podcast - and as I started listening more, the ad insert started really bugging me.\n* Podcasts had to be on \"their\" platform - because they didn't support RSS back then. As I got interested in podcasts, I wanted to listen to \"not so mainstream\" podcasts, and inevitably they wouldn't be available on Stitcher\n* As I got more into podcasts, the \"you can have exactly one playlist and you'll be grateful for it\" approach became untenable. I wanted to maintain different playlists for different activities (based on how much attention I'm likely to have for listening) - and that was impossible on Stitcher. Every time I moved from commuting to cooking mode, I would have to manually reset that one playlist. It was okay when there were like two podcasts I was listening to - but was a massive pain with a hundred\n* I am a bit hazy on this (I haven't used Stitcher in 5 years), but I think Stitcher didn't have the ability to change the play order of a single podcast. At least I remember manually queuing up the episodes for History of Rome so they would play from old to new\n* I wanted an ad-free experience and was willing to pay for it. However I wasn't gonna pay a monthly subscription for a *podcatcher* - especially one that bundled in the cost of a bunch of shows I had zero interest in. \n\nI don't *hate* Stitcher - but I think it's a very limited app, targeted towards folks who listen to a dozen or so podcasts at most. It's not a good fit for me - or for anyone else deep in the podcast rabbit hole.",

I tried and rejected Castbox (liked the UI and discovery, no audio ads, could create multiple playlists, but required a subscription to remove all ads), Podcast Addict (really hated the interface - it just didn't vibe for me + didn't have playlist support), Google Podcasts (didn't have playlist support + very simplistic UI, felt more geared towards casual users) and AntennaPod (loved that it's open source, liked the UI - but no support for playlists)\n\nI have used Podcast Republic for 5+ years now and never felt the need to look for another podcast app (For comparison, Stitcher lasted about 1.5 years). Its visuals might not appeal to everybody and search is a bit weird sometimes (I use the iTunes or RSS URL to find the podcast on the few occasions search acts up), but it's definitely the best fit for my use case! Allows tagging podcasts for organization, creating multiple playlists, setting different play styles for each (so my discovery playlist is set to play a random episode, whereas others go in sequence), podcast specific speed and audio boost settings, automated sleep timers that come on if I start a podcast within a time range (useful since I use podcasts to fall asleep) and a whole host of other things. I also love the discovery - it lets me change my location to see what's popular in that region (&amp; I can filter by categories, of course). Good way to find relatively lesser known podcasts!",

I can respect an app that puts features behind a paywall if they're just an app. If you're also a production company, especially something like Stitcher with a paywalled content library, you already make money elsewhere and you're just using brand prestige to strongarm users into paying you more.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m looking for a specific type of podcast. I\u2019m interested in hearing stories from someone who basically had their life fall apart. I don\u2019t mean losing a family member necessarily, although that could be interesting as well. I mean someone who went through a severe public humiliation to the point they lost their job or relationships. Someone who was \u201ccancelled\u201d but not necessarily a celebrity. I just think it would be interesting to hear someone\u2019s story like that, even if they deserved it.",

She speaks to people who have survived disasters, people wrongly accused of crimes or wrongly convicted, there's one where a woman accidentally killed a classmate as a teen, people who became internet/reality TV famous or renowned, people who had big sex scandals, etc.\n\nIt is a British podcast so if you're not from the UK you may not have heard of quite a few of the stories at the time, but she also interviews people who were famous from events that happened in the US and worldwide in general, there's an episode on Rebecca Black and one on Rachel Dolezal, for example. I've found the episodes to be interesting, even if I didn't hear the story at the time though.",

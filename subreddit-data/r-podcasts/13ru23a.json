    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for more podcasts about cults, fringe religious groups, as well as some about true crime like identity theft, extreme relationships, or catfishing like Something Was Wrong and Sweet Bobby. I figure this might also act as a recommendation list for those who like similar things! I love investigative journalism or documentary style podcasts, and as well done as they are, I\u2019m not looking so much for stuff like Oh No! Ross and Carrie, more something along the lines of Heaven\u2019s Gate or Revelations, or someone\u2019s personal accounts of growing up in a cult like Leaving Eden. Not super interested in podcasts that cover different topics each episode unless it\u2019s about one religious group (ie. no My Favorite Murder) This is most of what I have already listened to: \n\nBetter Call Bethel,\nTwin Flames,\nEscaping NXIM,\nSomething Was Wrong,\nDear Franklin Jones, \nRevelations,\nSweet Bobby, \nLeaving Eden,\nHeaven\u2019s Gate,\nThe Commune, \nThe Sunshine Place, \nThe Missionary,\nConviction, \nThe Dream, \nStolen,\nSerial,\nPreacher Boys,\nNo strings Attached, \nHoaxed,\nHouse of Prayer,\nRoot of Evil,\nEmbracing Apostasy,\nBed of lies(the season about HIV was a little too disturbing for me but absolutely well done) \n\nI\u2019m an avid podcast listener in need of more! Let me know if you can help!",

Rather than being an overview by someone studying cults, it's actual stories from people who grew up inside a cult or converted and left once things got too crazy. It's really well done and sensitive to the survivors of extreme religious.",

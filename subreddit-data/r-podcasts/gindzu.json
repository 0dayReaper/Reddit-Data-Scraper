    "postText": "A friend of mine recorded interviews on cassette tape 20 years ago. Interviews with some of the biggest hip-hop artists of the time, talking about how they got to where they are and everything that led up to it. Interviews range from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Some of these artists have passed and the stories are amazing. I have been listening to podcasts for over 10 years but have never produced one. \n\n I work in video media and have converted all cassettes to digital. \n\nThe question is, what now? Do we shop for buyers? Who would I talk to? I'm looking for ideas.",

            "comment": "Hello OP, people are giving you advice but not asking an important question first.\n\nYou say they are unheard that your friend recorded on cassette, did he interview these artists himself? If not how did he obtain these? Before any proper advice can be given the ownership and intellectual property aspect needs to be known.\n\nIf ownership is free and clear you can go a number of routes, given you posted this to podcasts my assumption is you (and possibly your friend) are hoping to find a way to monetize the collection.",

                    "comment": "I could not agree more \u2014 fantastic advice. It is absolutely essential that OP has a clear picture of ownership before attempting to monetise these interviews. \n\nFor example: assuming your friend was a journalist; were they freelance or were these interviews recorded while employed or contracted? If the answer is in the latter, it\u2019s reasonable to assume your friend\u2019s employment contract had a provision granting the employer exclusive ownership of any intellectual property generated by the employee in the course of their employment. \n\nIf that business was sold or liquidated, those rights likely transferred to the new owners or creditors. Over 20 years, especially in an industry as disrupted over that period as media, it\u2019s entirely possible that ownership of the rights could have passed through several hands. I know of one trade journal that was recently acquired by its sixth owner in fourteen years. \n\nIf OP/friend don\u2019t own the rights and these interviews are as significant as insinuated, it is certainly possible that they would generate enough interest to attract the attention of the rights holder/s. This would likely spell a costly legal saga for OP/friend, especially if the rights holder/s form the opinion that OP/friend did not monetise the content to its full potential and seek reparation in addition to recovery. \n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s very unlikely that any *professional* publisher would seek to acquire your interviews without understanding the provenance of the content as they would not want to expose themselves to a potential lawsuit if the actual rights owner/s step forward at a later date. \n\nTL;DR: seek advice from an intellectual property specialist before attempting to monetise. If it\u2019s too much hard work, and you want the content to be released, consider donating the tapes to a relevant music history trust with the caveat that ownership is unknown and needs to be researched.",

I think that shopping it to someone who could do it justice is the route that makes the most sense. I am hoping that there might be a shot that someone on here might have an idea of who that person/persons could be. Ideally either someone who is in the industry and could present it to the people who love the genre, or maybe a existing podcast/ platform that could present it to the masses to tell the amazing stories.",

We want the potential show to reveal itself as it gets released, however that would happen. \n\nThe interviews that were recorded are 100% owned by the interviewer and were consented to by the artists\n\nSome of the artists include Gangstarr, GZA, Saigon, and Dilla to name a few. \n\nThe amount of recordings have the potential to be 2 to 3 years of podcasts in my estimation. \n\nI appreciate a lot of the opinions I have read and it makes me more excited to get the ball rolling with this.",

    "postText": "I've gotten addicted to listening to the Fallen Empires podcast before bed. If try to read a book I will be up for hours on end so I need darkness to sleep. I'm going to be running out of them soon so I was looking for anything that had a\nsimilar quality, either podcasts or audio versions of books. Prefer history but any interesting nonfiction would work. By same quality it's hard to describe but if you've listened to Fall of Empires the narrator/writer has a very nice voice and the podcast isn't loud or jarring in anyway. Perfect \"interesting so I enjoy it a lot yet it will let me fall asleep eventually\" podcast. ETA: It's actually called [Fall of Civilizations](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/) and I highly recommend it. (Especially the Aztecs and Easter Island.)",

These are my favorite history podcasts and I find that they strike the right balance between engaging and relaxing. \n\n[The Tides of History](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tides-of-history/id1257202425)\n\n[The Fall of Rome](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fall-of-rome-podcast/id1141563910)\n\n[This is History](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-history-a-dynasty-to-die-for/id1641568639)\n\n[Noble Blood](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/noble-blood/id1468332063)\n\nAlso the audiobooks for [Wolf Hall](https://www.audible.com/pd/Wolf-Hall-Audiobook/B002V0QOBQ) and [Bring Up the Bodies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Bring-Up-the-Bodies-Audiobook/B007WU26KI).\n\nEdit: Oops just saw your comment about nonfiction. Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies are historical fiction (very well-researched but still fiction).",

Looks like the fall of empires has only one episode at least on Spotify. \n\nNot sure how similar it is because I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re listening to ;) but I like Conflicted, it\u2019s a history podcast about conflicts.",

They are so fucking annoyingly elitist in that aspect acting like watching football makes me some feral alpha with no intelligence. If you can't tell I had to drop my old fantasy nerd friends cause they are more judgemental than any football fans I've ever met.  Football nerds are always way more receptive of niche nerdism, even the most typical jocks will listen to me go on about other more niche shit, and most of them have some niche nerd shit they are into.",

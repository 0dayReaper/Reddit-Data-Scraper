Hephaestus space station, the dysfunctional crew deals with daily life-or-death emergencies, while searching for signs of alien life and discovering there might be more to their mission than they thought. \n\nTune into your home away from home... seven and a half light years away from Earth...\n\nArs paradoxica\nars PARADOXICA is a love letter to physics, fiction, and the future. It's a disorienting  journey through spacetime and the Cold War. It's a tome of secret history you stumbled across in a library in the dead of night.\n\nIt's an award-winning serial audio drama.\n\nWhen an experiment in a time much like our own goes horribly awry, Dr. Sally Grissom finds herself stranded in the past and entrenched in the  activities of a clandestine branch of the US government. Grissom and her team quickly learn that there's no safety net when toying with the  fundamental logic of the universe. \n\nThe Strata\nIn a dystopian city, an ageing courier is forced to go into business with an underworld ganglord in order to pay for the treatment that keeps him alive. \n\n \n\nSet in a sprawling dystopian metropolis called 'The Strata' and featuring an ensemble cast, this podcast interweaves a collection of stories into a single overarching narrative.",

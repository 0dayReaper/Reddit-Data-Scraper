    "postText": "Not too long ago i asked for a podcasts made by academics, this led me to the podcast pre history. It was great, started at the very begining. Primates turning to humans, and humans developing tools into culture. This podcast closes off at the end of neolithic, early calcholithic and i want to progress to the next point, which is copper age/calcholithic. \n\nTLDR\n\nIm looking for a podcast about copper age, done by academics",

He's currently on the start of the iron age, but if you look for episodes from 2020-2021 you should find info from all over the world.

Sign onto places like spreaker; register your podcast and you can send it off to iTunes, stitcher, and Spotify.\n3. If you want it to sound good get professional help. I found my actors, editor, and composers off casting call club. You can put in a request for a fairly inexpensive fee.\n4. Make sure it\u2019s too your liking there\u2019s a lot of busy work and editing. If you did step 2. It\u2019s as easy as just uploading it to the site.\n5. It\u2019s not a bad idea to make a website and social media accounts. A Facebook page and twitter account helps you join the community.",

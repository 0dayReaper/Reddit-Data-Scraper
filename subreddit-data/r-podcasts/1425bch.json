    "postText": "Hello hello! I\u2019m new to podcasts and am looking for some recommendations! Little bit about me\u2026 I\u2019ve always been a very deep thinker, I\u2019m always open to new ideas and concepts. Im an atheist 19 y/o female, although I feel like I have the brain of a 26 year old as I\u2019ve lived a lot of life and really strive to grow as a human being. I try to live my life very natural and I\u2019m inclusive of all types of people and beliefs. Although I\u2019m atheist I have a passion for learning about religion. Also I love plants and space :3 \n\nAnyways now that you know a little bit about me I\u2019d love if anyone has any suggestions for some podcasts you think I may like :) the first ones I\u2019ve ever listened to was \u201cRadical Empathy\u201d from jubilee and I LOVE it, as well as I\u2019ve watched all of \u201cThe Midnight Gospel\u201d and loved it :)\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading!! I\u2019d love to hear some of your favorite podcasts that you think I may like :3",

He tells the stories of people involved in the events to create a narrative.  The pacing and production values are excellent.  Some of the subjects range from the lead up to the wall street bust of 1929, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the split between Sunni and Shia factions in Islam.\n\nLiterature and history is another favorite.  Also check out In Our Time, it's a BBC  production that covers history, science philosophy etc..",

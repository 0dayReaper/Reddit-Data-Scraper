This is not a thread to promote your podcast **nor is it a place to rant about things about podcasts that annoy you - these comments will be removed.**\n\nAlso, please check out our wiki info pages including [listener FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/faqs1) and our [list of other podcasting subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/podcastsubreddits).

If not, please feel free to submit all frequently asked questions (FAQs) here.\n\nIndividual FAQ posts will be removed and users will be directed to post their question here in this thread. Be as specific as possible - \"looking for a new podcast\" is a bit broad.\n\nIf you are helping / answering a question, be polite and not condescending.

It seems like most of the time, after I finish listening to a podcast, it'll wait a day then mark it \"Unplayed\" again. There's no option to mark all as listened to. chatGPT could probably write a better podcasting tracker.\n\nIs there something free that actually works, ideally on phone and desktop too?",

On the topic of Chat GPT, I tried asking it for podcast recommendations for a couple different subjects, it give me a list of ten or so podcast and relevant episodes. Every episode it listed was a complete fabrication, even the names of interviewee's or air dates.",

I love the granular playback speed, trim silence, and queue ability, and am trying to keep Spotify for music only. there seem to be plenty of other options, but the best ones seem to be either paid upfront or only available on Android.\n\nThanks!",

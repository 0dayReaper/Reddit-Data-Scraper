    "postText": "I've been using the Apple Podcast app for quite a while, and I really like it. However, the auto-generated \"up next\" playlist isn't customizable enough for me. I'd like to be able to prioritize some shows over others. For example, I have a few short daily news show that I want to always play first on my commute to work before then moving onto weekly or monthly updated long-form entertainment shows.  \n\n\nAre there any currently available iOS apps with this functionality?",

You can queue new episodes automatically etc too. If you have any other feature requests they are very active on Discord too.\n\n(I moved from Pocket Casts, as they increased the price to \u00a340 a year, for new subscribers only but there was confusion and I'd already moved on)",

    "postText": "Hi all, as per the title really.\n\nTrying to remember a podcast I listened to maybe 3 years ago +/-.  It was a true crime one, hosted mainly by a guy but for a while he was also joined by 1 of 2 female co-hosts (not at the same time). One of the female co-hosts was a horror actress, who I think left the show after there was a terror attack at the bar she was working in.\n\nThe show mainly looked at serial killers, amongst the occasional one-off of specific singular killings and other crimes.\n\nTried searching but there no names coming up that ring the right bell for me. Anyone able to offer any suggestions? \n\nThanks",

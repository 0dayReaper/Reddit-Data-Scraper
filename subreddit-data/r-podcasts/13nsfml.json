    "postText": "I listen to some political commentator podcasts but I really would like to learn more about many of the different political issues in our country so I better understand what these commentators and the media are talking about. \nIm not sure how to word this but what I\u2019m looking for is a podcast where each episode explains/educates it\u2019s listeners on the political/social issues instead of just commenting on them or telling us news about those issues. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m interested in issues involving education reform, healthcare reform, economic issues in our country, and the housing crisis. I\u2019d like a podcast where they take each of the topics and break down the history of the issues, what current laws/policies/systems are in place currently, the general opinions of the right and the left when it comes to fixing these issues and just some basic background info we would need to understand what\u2019s going on. \n\nIs there anything like that?",

They take an issue, interview two guests with differing views, and ask them for tangible proposals and what the other side \u201cmight be right\u201d about. It is very subdued and positive by design.",

I don't listen to every one, but their political/economics ones are fascinating.\n\nThis is more of a shot in the dark, but NPR's No Compromise really helped put today's political climate in context for me. It's a miniseries that traces the history of the American evangelical gun/education/antimask lobbying effort, even won a pulitzer.",

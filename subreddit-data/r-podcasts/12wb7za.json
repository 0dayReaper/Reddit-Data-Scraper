    "postText": "I tried to settle on NPR's \"Shortwave\", because it's the right length, and I generally like NPR.  But this podcast is like \"Baby's First Science Podcast\".  I mean, is it *meant* for children?\n\nI'm looking for something under 30 minutes that is NOT preachy, and hopefully focuses on science frontiers (not medical)... new stuff that's coming down the line.  The length is not a deal breaker.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nEDIT for future searches:\n\nThese have been highly recommended in the comments:\n\n* In Our Time (BBC) &lt;--- I am liking this one, goes pretty deep in 45 min\n* The Infinite Monkey Cage (BBC)\n* Quirks and Quarks (CBC)\n* Babbage (The Economist) &lt;--- This really seems to hit the mark for me\n* Quanta Podcasts [various]\n\nSomewhat controversial suggestions:\n\n* Science Vs. (annoying host? fluff?)\n* Ologies (too much fluff?)",

I also really like *Planetary Radio*, the Planetary Society's podcast; although it has lots of material that is pretty surface-level, the interviews are allowed to get into the weeds.\n\nThe rest of the podcasts I listen to have a biological bent, but are definitely useful to listen to as an expert in one of the fields covered. I focus on the Microbe.tv podcasts, with my favorite being their first, *This Week in Virology*. They are usually quite long episodes though.",

In terms of fluff, sometimes the guest talks a lot about hard science and sometimes it   is more conversational.

Because the average person will not want to listen to science above high school level. Their eyes would start to glaze over and they\u2019ll move to something else. Podcasting isn\u2019t very lucrative but is very time consuming. \n\nSo it\u2019s kind of like you have to pick and choose whether you want an entertaining podcast or a pure science podcast (again scientists who aren\u2019t trained to talk for a living). \n\nI think it would help to look for more niche science podcasts. I\u2019ll try to link some later.",

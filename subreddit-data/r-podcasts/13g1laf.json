    "postText": "My favorite podcast is Hey Riddle Riddle. For their 200th episode, one of the hosts asked people to describe the show in one word, and 75% of the people who answered answered with \"chaos.\" I love it, but it is sometimes really out there. Scenes get derailed and come unhinged immediately, if the answer to a riddle is bad, sometimes the hosts get legit angry, and there's a fair amount of overtalking and just a lot of chaotic energy. I love it, but there are times when it is just too much stimulation and I'd like something a little less manic or chaotic but still funny.\n\nI think part of this might have to do with a lot of the shows I listen to have male hosts or mostly male hosts. I have listened to one or two podcasts that essentially had like five dudes taking turns to crack a joke on a particular subject without anyone really laughing or acknowledging anyone else's joke. Maybe I should try a few more shows with female or mostly female hosts.\n\nIn a similar vein, I'd prefer something that doesn't talk about a ton of TV or new movies or the like. Sometimes that makes me feel like there's just so much content out there that I could be trying but instead I'm listening to people talk about the content instead of experiencing it. I don't mind podcasts with ads, we all need to get paid after all, but I don't want to walk away from a podcast feeling like I need to watch another five shows.\n\nIn another thread, someone recommended Everything is Alive for kids. I have listened to that one a bit and I think it fits. I'll try downloading a few more episodes for when I'm in one of those moods.\n\nFeel free to recommend anything. Typing this out, it sounds like I'm a fragile flower ready to tilt over at any second, but I'm really not. It's just sometimes I want a bit of a calmer energy than usual and I don't have something to fill that void at the moment. Thanks in advance!",

I really like the Kim young booster episodes. Or the Bowen Yang episodes. \u201cDinner Parties\u201d with Alison Roman was really funny lol! \n\nWith all podcasts, of course there\u2019s a flop or two, but they\u2019re pretty consistent with great episodes !",

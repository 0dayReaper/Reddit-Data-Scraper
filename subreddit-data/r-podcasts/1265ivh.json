Lol\n\nI like podcasts with folks who know each other well (spouses, siblings, long-time best friends, etc) who **actually like each other** and usually talk about not particularly deep topics, with the occasional genuinely heart-felt episode or segment. If they dont seem like they actually want to be there, I dont want it.\n\nWith that in mind:\n\nMy Brother, My Brother, and Me\nSawbones\nThe Adventure Zone\nDimension 20\nThe Besties (im not actually into videogames, but i can listen to these 4 poke fun at themselves and each other endlessly)\nDear Hank and John\nEar Biscuits \nStill Buffering\nSimply Pod Logical\nDo Go On\nOmnibus\nJenna &amp; Julien\nPlant Daddy Podcast\nSolve This Murder/Escape This Podcast\n\nI used to LOVE Reply All...but it imploded in 2020 and couldn't get its vibe back. IMO. Some episodes also started to really toe my line of \"people who actually like each other\" previous to that as well. But I REALLY miss Yes, Yes, No and have found no acceptable substitute :(\n\nTryPod is sometimes good, and sometimes unlistenable for me. So YMMV.",

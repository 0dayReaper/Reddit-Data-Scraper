    "postText": "**What we are:**  \n\n\nNine months ago, I posted on this subreddit asking if an IMDb equivalent for podcasts existed -- see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/4rajrj/does_there_exist_a_imdb_with_ratings_for_podcasts/). A flurry of responses and grievances came about, and it was clear that such a concept was desired by the subreddit community. So, a team of six of us from the US, Australia, and the UK have all banded together to create www.podchaser.com. \n\nPodcast discovery is an ongoing problem for podcast listeners. Some recommendation algorithms exist, but they\u2019re generally based off podcast show preferences, rather than episode preference. Generally, the same 10 or so podcasts are recommended and remain on top charts. So, we are building a system around individual episode ratings and reviews. Our front page will feature the hottest episodes rather than podcasts, allowing users to discover a broader array of content. Users can also check out reviews on individual episodes before diving in. Some podcasts have shows with varying degrees of quality, and now you can just check out feedback in one place rather than googling around fan forums and subreddits.\n\n [Here](http://i.imgur.com/2v7lxOf.jpg) [are](http://i.imgur.com/jBxADxz.jpg) [some](http://i.imgur.com/c0OySMd.png) [screenshots]\n(http://i.imgur.com/bqibL1M.png) [.](http://i.imgur.com/nanlkbY.jpg)\n\n**How you can help:**  \n\n\nOur beta is starting **June 10th**. We\u2019d love some feedback from the subreddit (especially from podcasters!), as this is where the whole project started. We also will need your precious data (ratings and reviews). Please head over to www.podchaser.com to sign up. We will also be giving out invites to everyone once we launch. We would love your feedback on our feature set and recommendations for features you would like to see. We will hang out here for a few hours.\n\nThe following are here to answer your questions:\n\n* Ben: lead developer, back-end, resident Gilfoyle, Melbourne, AU\n* Ryan: creative director/lead designer, furrows eyebrows often, Melbourne, AU\n* Bradley: non-technical chump, MBA/business guy, Louisville, KY\n* James: United Airlines &amp; Pepsi PR representative, DC \n* Cole: Accountant/Finance/Banker/Rain Man, Indianapolis, IN\n\n**The beta will include the following features:**\n\n* Searchable episode descriptions/powerful search \n* Podcast ratings/reviews\n* Podcast episode ratings/reviews\n* Save podcasts/episodes/people to your list\n* Search by podcast host/contributor and see what else they\u2019ve worked on\n* Share episodes/podcasts/people to social media\n\n\n\n**For 1.0 and 2.0, we are also developing the following:**\n\n* Multiple shareable lists with comments per item\n* Trending topics\n* Import/export your lists as OPML\n* Personalised podcast and episode recommendations based on your ratings and saved items\n* Mark episodes with badges such as \u2018Best starter episode\u2019 or \u2018Funniest episode\u2019 to help new listeners\n* Shareable moments\n* Follow other users or specific podcast contributors and get notifications about their activity\n* Reputation system with the opportunity to moderate user contributions\n\n**Podcaster Features:** \n\n* Claim your podcast page and have some control over how it is displayed\n* View analytics for your podcast (What would be useful for you to see?)\n* What other features would you like for your page/community?\n\n\n**TL;DR** \n\nWe're making a cool podcast website, tell us what you want from it\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the questions already! We will be here all night long, keep 'em coming!\n\nEDIT2: We'll be here until 12 Eastern Time, so feel free to keep asking questions and offering feedback. We've already gotten some invaluable feedback from everyone. Thanks again!\n\nEDIT3: Thanks so much! Please  continue to post on here and we'll respond to you, just not in as timely of a manner. We are excited to release the product to you guys. Thanks again for all of the great responses. ",

(I live a fair bit out of the city, haha)\n\nA big feature of the site will be the pages for podcasters and contributors - the goal is to list all podcasts they host along with all episodes they\u2019ve been a guest on or contributed to in some way. This will initially rely on our deep database of indexed episode data to find the episodes, but will soon require user collaboration to make sure we fill in all the gaps. We\u2019re hoping this will contribute to the discovery process, as if listeners tend to enjoy a particular presenter then they might be interested in other podcasts they\u2019ve contributed to.\n\nAs for avoiding presenters with annoying voices, I think allowing users to create personal tags on podcasters (as well as episodes and tags) is a great idea, and we\u2019ll add that as a feature to our roadmap!\n\n-Ben",

One of the main things that I look for (without an easy way to do it) is whether or not the show does interviews.

That leaves me scrolling through episode title and descriptions trying to decipher how they do things. Bonus points for specifying remote guests or in-studio guests.\n\nThat may be a little out of the focus of your project - but having a couple podcaster-focused features may help to bring in podcasters to build the critical mass you need.",

For instance, I was a big fan of the Disinformation podcast from around 2008-2009 or so, but the podcast no longer produces new epsiodes. Is your service striving to be comprehensive in the same way IMDB is comprehensive about movies?\n\nFrom the sound of this post, it looks like you're going to try to present a podcast aggregating platform like Stitcher, but better. Is there any plan (for you or anyone else) to create a database of every extant and extinct podcast, indexed by title, genre, creators, network, year, length of show, etc.? When I say a database, I don't mean links to the podcasts themselves that enable users to listen to them a la Stitcher; I'm talking about an interactive directory that lists (and delivers metadata about) podcasts in the same way that IMDB does for movies or that WorldCat does for library items?\n\nSorry about the librarian-nerd question, and sorry if my question is wildly off-topic. What you're creating sounds great and I'm just curious about its scope.\n\n",

We currently have information in our database for over 350,000 podcasts and over 14 million individual episodes, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to gather a lot of interesting statistics about that!\n\n-Ben",

Podbay (which I believe is down) and Podcat (also down) have some good ideas. You mentioned Stitcher, too, which does a lot of great things. One main problem is that many of these features need to coexist to provide what listeners really want, in a beautifully designed, accessible, and comprehensive package. There should be finite search results in the Google Knowledge Graph a la IMDb.\n\nAs far as our differentiator, it's certainly focusing on individual episodes. When I'm about to listen to the most recent Joe Rogan Experience episode, I would kill to have a quick resource--checking for highest rated episode, sifting through comments on individual installments--to look through before diving in.\n\nAnd yes, content creator control is something we're excited about. We're also striving to make the database very alive, with tags and badges and user-submitted data. You're right: a lot of boring, lifeless wireframes exist, and that doesn't quite cut it.\n\nThanks so much for the feedback.\n\n-Bradley",

Does that include the audio file itself, or are you serving that straight off the feed?\n\nLast question! Do podcasts have to be submitted separately to your directory or are you using the iTunes directory?",

We floated around the idea of creating our own format for adding that information to existing podcast feeds in a standardised way, but then realised there are already other groups out there making good progress on it already. We'll probably adopt one of those formats once they're more progressed.\n\n2. The audio file itself will remain on the podcast's hosting server, as they'll likely still want to register the stats they'd get when listeners play or download their episodes.\n\n3. We're using a range of sources to seed our database, but adding a podcast to the iTunes database will be enough for it to show up in our database too, or you can submit it separately to us if you want to get it live faster and have more control of how it appears specifically on our website as a 'claimed' podcast. \n\n-Ryan",

Most of the data will be driven by the RSS feed by necessity, but there is a lot of information that isn\u2019t contained in the feed that is useful to both podcasters and listeners.\n\nYou\u2019ll have control over your own bio and photo for your podcaster page, as well as control of who is connected to your episodes as guests/contributors. We\u2019ll let you add links to your social media accounts, give you some control over the categories and tags your podcast is placed in, and will give you some insight into the analytics around visits and plays of your episodes. Once we start adding more social features you might have the ability to communicate directly to your followers.\n\nSome of these may become premium features, though we haven\u2019t locked down our offerings in that space quite yet.\n\n-Ben",

            "comment": "First of all awesome product! I'm currently in the process of designing and building a product for a totally different demographic and would like to DM about your guys process.\n\n\nAs UX and UI designer I'm going to give you some feedback. The first thing that bothers me is the gray on the text. It seems really hard to read. I understand that the podcast image, name and rating are where you're drawing the user's eye to. But isn't the category and duration of the podcast just as important?\n\n\nAlso I see some design inconsistency comparing this image http://i.imgur.com/2v7lxOf.jpg to this http://i.imgur.com/bqibL1M.png mainly the \"TRENDING EPISODES\" headline. One is pink and just two words while the other is gray. Personally I believe the pink one works way better as it draws my eyes and I instantly understand what the list is. With the gray one it too me awhile to even notice it and understand what the list was. Now granted when I say it took me awhile, I mean 5 seconds but that moment of confusion is what you want to avoid. Also I believe using \"TRENDING EPISODES\" over \"TRENDING PODCAST EPISODES\" is much more easier to digest. and it flows with the other two worded headlines (ie: TRENDING PODCAST, TRENDING TOPICS, and etc).\n\n\nI believe having a way to listen to an podcast in one click would be incredibly helpful. Take this page http://i.imgur.com/2v7lxOf.jpg for example. If you gave the user the ability to click on the image or replaced rate with play, they can instantly start listening to a podcast once they visit the site.\n\n\nIt seems like rating the podcast is very important to the team. Can you explain why? I believe the option to rate should appear after they have listened to an episode (whether it's 1 second or the full episode). This would allow the space to place a play button in those places.\n\n\nOn mobile (http://i.imgur.com/nanlkbY.jpg) how do you gesture to show the Rate and Save actions? I ask because I think adding a play button there would be very helpful.\n\n\nOnce again great idea and great looking product, I'm super excited to use it!",

                    "comment": "Thanks heaps for the feedback! We probably should have mentioned this in the original post, but the mockups aren't final, and we've actually made some changes since I originally designed them. We've been tweaking elements again and again, so it's been an iterative process throughout. What that means though is that while elements in one mockup started off identical to another, changes were occasionally made to one but not the other (with internal notes specifying which style we'll go with on the actual build). In the final product, things will be more consistent and browser/screen tested for accessibility and usability. I think I prefer the pink title too, so we're in agreement there. \ud83d\ude09\n\nRatings are something we feature prominently because the goal is to create a communal hub around podcasts where feedback (including ratings/reviews) is used as a strong signal by our algorithm to determine what recommendations to give users, rather than just showing them other podcasts in the same category. \n\nI know what you mean about the play button vs. the rate button. Essentially we're not looking to compete against podcast players, because everyone has their favourite and there's no way to create a player that works for everyone. Instead, we're focusing on discovery of podcasts, episodes, and people and letting you listen wherever you want to, so the rating seems to work with our functionality more-so than a play button (much in the same way as IMDb not being a way to watch movies, but a way to categorise, review, share and discover movies). We may be more likely to include a play button on the mobile version of the site, but we'll have to discuss that and work out what we think will be the best option. \n\nThis is one of those things that we'll be tweaking quite a bit throughout our testing and beta stages, depending on how people use our site. If something doesn't work, we'll figure out why and offer a better solution as we go. By the time the beta's finished, we'll have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface thanks to the community helping us out throughout the process.\n\nThanks again for your feedback; it's invaluable at this stage in the game!\n\n-Ryan",

That's not a nuance that could be shown with just tagging, a little bit of extra info by rating the tag can tell a lot.\n\nAlso let me pay you with money, not (just) info and ad clicks or whatever. It promises me some stability to Podchaser's future, which makes me less hesitant to invest time in it.",

We have an email on our landing page, but in case you want it, you can always email me directly @ bradley@podchaser.com. \n\nTo answer your question, we are definitely working on a rated tagging system of sorts. We'll likely give the user a thumbs up/thumbs down option so that the most relevant tags go to the top. We're also considering giving the podcaster the ability to highlight x amount of tags that they deem most relevant. How exactly we implement this depends on how users end up using the site. But great feedback. Thanks!\n\nAnd we may be opening up investment opportunities to the public, so that's the closest thing I can think of to help you give us money \ud83d\ude00\n\n-Bradley",

I've had a case where a feed would break and I'd not noticed, it would been nice to receive an alert for when that happens so I can make a change to my feed to correct it.\n\nit'd be nice to have a system like audible channels, where they combine multiple audio sources into feeds with a theme. Even better if you can drop out an RSS feed for that.\n\nAlso a filtered podcast feed would be nice. I've a few RSS feeds with multiple podcasts in where I'm only interested in a few [Startalk keep pushing their sports podcast in their main feed &gt;:( ]\n\nMaybe some transcription/translations services, or a services that searches/highlights transcripts.\n\nMaybe some social stuff like teams/groups/guilds. Not sure if that makes sense as a premium service.\n\n____\n\n\nA soundcloud comment system would be good, but that stuff gets crazy cluttered. So you could do some combination between soundcloud comments and twitch chat. That way you could highlight premium users comments, and do podchaser emotes system.\n\nOn commenting system, don't do forums, just embed reddit comments. They're so much better than forums.\n\nAlso since everyone on Podchasers will be interested in the audio medium, it would make sense to have a store selling audiobooks, audiodramas, maybe some original content, maybe get some behind the scenes audio or bloopers from podcasts, or podcast soundtracks. You could also do some live audio stuff there like they do for podfest/podcon.\n\nI wouldn't mind the mobile app being paid rather than free, or a paid podchaser-brand official podcast player that uses podchaser features.\n\nFor podcsasters you could do something like [quantic foundry](quanticfoundry.com) does for games. They analyse the audiences for games, and sell reports to developers focused on explaining what motivates players to play their games. If anyone owuld have the data to make those reports it'd be you. Either way its interesting stuff.",

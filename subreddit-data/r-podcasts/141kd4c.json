    "postText": "Like stated, I mainly listen to TMG whenever I look for a podcast to listen to. I also enjoy Stretch &amp; Fade, Supermegacast (although I haven't enjoyed their episodes as much as of late), here and there I'll dabble in Trash Taste but mainly just for the guest episodes. I also enjoy Cum Town, but it's usually the highlights I'll listen to since I've never been able to sit through a whole episode of their show. Used to listen to Sleepcast a bit.\n\nI definitely need at least some other comedy-heavy podcast series to listen to. If y'all have something you think would be up my alley, shoot it out! Bonus points if you have a particular episode of it that you think does the best at representing the show.",

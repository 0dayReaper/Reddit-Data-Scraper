My friends are more sheltered and come from different backgrounds from me, so they don\u2019t really get it because they can rely on their parents. Anyway, I just think there\u2019s always more to learn, and sometimes you can find people who\u2019ve had similar experience who write books, make podcasts, etc. \n\nTL:DR: I understand that you can\u2019t entirely rely upon podcasts for adulthood, but sometimes you can pick up some interesting tidbits, and they\u2019re fun to listen to while cleaning lol.",

I feel thats unnecessarily putting negativity on yourself.  There are things that you just aren't proficient in because you were just never taught them.  A better way to look at it is that you do your learning over the course of a lifetime, not that you magically hit 20 yrs old and should know how to change your brakes, or about pensions, or about 1000s of other things we experience that are new learning experiences for us.  Just this week I learned about cleaning and timing small engine carburetors on my chainsaw and trimmer (thanks to YouTube) and it was a great feeling taking two machines that would not start and get them going again.\n\nTrue adulting means making good decisions, being reliable, learning patience and having empathy and understanding for others. \n\nAnyway, with that being said, I'm glad you asked the question because I'm definitely going to check out some of these pods.",

That metric is very subjective. Capable to me might look like maintaining a healthy family life, successful job, fulfilling hobbies, etc. Capable to someone else might look like putting food on the table... which is the bare minimum. Many people don't have healthy connections to learn these aspects and more, so it's almost crucial that we expand our horizons and learn from -everything- not just current/future people in our lives.",

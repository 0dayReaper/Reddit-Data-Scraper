What those episodes are can be pretty much anything but I\u2019m looking specifically for true stories and real history, etc. I just want to know a bunch about some different topics! \nI love collecting random bits of information that\u2019s really in depth but useless so that\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019m looking for. It can be history, true crime, science. Anything really!",

The format is Bragg interviewing a panel of three Oxbridge (or other British) scholars, starting from a general introduction to the topic and then diving into some of the interesting details. Really great stuff, if you have a bit of an academic bent.",

Latest episode is about Pokemon and all the claims to satanic/ devil worship/ dark magic. Pretty funny  \n\nBBC have the Documentary Podcast, half hour episodes on different topics around the world, I listened to one recently about women and children bring blackmailed with internet porn in south Korea and how misogyny is a new word and concept. \n\nIndoctrination is another fascinating pod about cults and high control groups \n\nLove and Radio have a huge backlog of interesting stories too.",

Each episode, the two hosts do a deep dive into the making of a different classic movie, TV show, album or song. They've only been doing it for about a year but they've already done more than 100 episodes \u2014 and the research that goes into it is CRAZY. They even did a three part, six-hour episode on the making of James Cameron's 'Titanic' for the 25th anniversary. (They don't call it \"Too Much Information\" for nothing!) But it's all so entertaining and they're hilarious. So deep and thorough. They both have written for places like Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly and MTV, so they really know their stuff. If you like pop culture history, you'll love this. \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/too-much-information/id1618071214",

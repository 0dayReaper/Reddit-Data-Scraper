Still fits my need for captivating stories but without the low mood that hours of true crime can bring. Any suggestions for similar shows? Went through mystery show in a day, would love more like these two.",

I thoroughly recommend it.",

For two seasons, anyway ...  \n\n\n**You're Wrong About**   \nTakes the form of the host reading their research to a guest, covers a wide range of topics, different topic every show  \n\n\n**Bret Easton Ellis**   \nHe's taken the show to Patreon now, but until 2017 this was the best podcast in the world. Truly stellar guests, but the highlight of every show is Ellis' opening monologue   \n\n\n**Cautionary Tales**   \nTakes the old saw that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it and demonstrates why. Different topic every week, great research   \n\n\n**Things Fall Apart**/**The Coming Storm**   \nTwo different BBC podcasts, but they're linked thematically. Basically, they explore the long, *weird* journey the USA took to the insane place it finds itself today    \n\n\n**The Butterfly Effect**/**Last Days of August**   \nJon Ronson examines how Pornhub took over the world and destroyed lives. Butterfly Effect's an Audible exclusive, but worth it   \n\n\n**You Must Remember This**   \nKarina Longworth uses the history of Hollywood as a lens to examine social change - peerless research and storytelling means this is fascinating even if films aren't your thing   \n\n\n**Criminal**   \nNot *quite* what the title suggests. Phoebe Judge has one of the great podcast voices   \n\n\n**Behind the Bastards**   \nRobert Evans and a series of guests discuss the evil people who made the world worse, from dictators to grifters and influencers.

It was definitely really interesting and has stayed in my head. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand how some radio stations apparently played the song so much that someone would know all the lyrics 25 years later but most people have never heard that song before in their life. \n\nI was constantly listening to the radio during that time in the 90s and I certainly never heard that song. I lived in a pretty major city, why was it played so much somewhere in Arizona but not in other places. I feel like I need more answers about the radio play of that song. Not sure why that\u2019s so interesting to me.",

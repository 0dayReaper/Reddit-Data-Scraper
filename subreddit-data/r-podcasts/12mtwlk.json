Sam does a lot of philosophy of happiness and wellness especially on his app Waking Up but often on his podcast Making Sense. \n\nNaval never talks about health though. Maybe try Huberman Lab for health stuff. \n\nWealth well there's a lot of those kind of shows. I guess it depends where you are on that path. Do you need someone to kick your butt and motivate you to go for it, then try Gary Vaynerchuck. Do you need ideas for small businesses or passive income ideas? Then try Smart Passive Income. Do you wanna know what billionaires are up to? Try We Study Billionaires. \n\nI think two shows which kid of cover all those areas are Tim Ferris and Rich Roll.",

Being involved in threatening to dox a Reddit mod, putting a child exploiter and proven liar on her podcast (Lex), continuously re-victimizing a victim of one of the \u201cbad guys\u201d from one of the seasons. Oh and her husband likes to show up in the shows subreddit and call everyone liars. Tiffany is toxic in the worst way",

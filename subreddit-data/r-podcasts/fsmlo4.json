Even the ones I love and enjoyed listening to every single day... then again, I had like 5 daily news podcasts so could have cut back to begin with. Even Planet Money and Reply All which are MY FAVES- I just had to stop. \n\nI still read an email news summary and that's all I get of new info.  \n\nOn the bright side, downloaded a ton of old 99PI throwback episodes and they've been keeping my ears happy :)",

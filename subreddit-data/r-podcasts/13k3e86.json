    "postText": "Hi all!\r  \n\r  \nI'm looking for German podcasts to listen to while commuting and working out. Something I'm looking for in particular is anything that resembles the content of [Isaac Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/@isaacarthurSFIA). His content is anything space travel and future technology related and focusses mostly on the far future and theoretical technologies like nuclear fusion, terraforming and living in space. Thanks in advance.",

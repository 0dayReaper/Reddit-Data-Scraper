There are always multiple sides to any story. This is true about current event reporting as well. \n\nHardcore history podcast is amazing, although not specifically focused on American history.",

Take in multiple sources and see what they do and don\u2019t agree upon. Consider the biases that may be at play when definitive statements are made. It\u2019s a good idea to listen to historians from outside the US as well, they tend not to display the subtle (or sometimes not) but unavoidable biases of US historians.",

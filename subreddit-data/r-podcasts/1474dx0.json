    "postText": "Hey I just thought back to my favourite podcasts and one I can really recommend is the \"Blender Guru Podcast\", but only certain episodes.  \n\n\nThe Podcast is mainly about computer graphics but that's only a small part (in the episodes provided). The speaker is an artist who traveled a lot and talks about his impressions of life and experiences. I really liked it since he seems like a smart guy, thought you might like it too.  \n\n\nIt's so old that you can only listen to it on the internet archive, still great tho (stay away from the interview episodes tho)\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/podcast\\_blender-guru\\_ep59-car-salesmen-luck-f\\_1000374793656\n\n[https://archive.org/details/podcast\\_blender-guru\\_bg-podcast-episode-47-my-exp\\_1000374793676](https://archive.org/details/podcast_blender-guru_bg-podcast-episode-47-my-exp_1000374793676)\n\n[https://archive.org/details/podcast\\_blender-guru\\_episode-37-korean-ferry-disa\\_1000374793732](https://archive.org/details/podcast_blender-guru_episode-37-korean-ferry-disa_1000374793732)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a very unknown podcast but I really like it and wish it would have continued. If you know something with a similar vibe I'm open for recommendations",

    "postText": "I've been going down a podcast rabbit hole finding the weirdest and most obscure podcasts as I've found myself getting bored with more mainstream podcasts. I've found I often enjoy the spinoffs a lot of big podcasts do more than their main one. \n\nMost recently, I started listening to The Dollop's The Past Times and I'm immediately hooked, although I never really liked the main Dollop podcast. I think they got really good at podcasting and found a better format.\n\nAnyone else found really good spinoffs of established podcasts?",

            "comment": "The *Radiolab* spin offs ***More Perfect*** (about the American Supreme Court) and ***Dolly Parton's America*** (looking at Dolly Parton through America and America through Dolly parton) are among the best.\n\n***Serial*** was sort of a spin-off of *This American Life*. ***S-town***, which some argue is the best podcast mini-series of all time, is a spin-off of *Serial*. ***The Trojan Horse Affair*** is also a quite good podcast from the creator of *S-town* and produced by *Serial Productions*.\n\n***Articles of Interest*** is a great spin off of *99% Invisible*. I used to put off listening to *99PI* episodes in my feed because I saw the titles and thought, \"I have absolutely zero interest in that shit\", and I am literally 100% of the time wrong \u2014 I am very interested in that shit. With *Articles of Interest*, the experience is always magnified because I don't feel a neutral disinterest, I feel like \"Clothes? That's definitely no for me.\" And it's been wonderful. I feel like I understand so much more about the culture of the West based on the second season, which was a deep exploration of \"preppy fashion\" (and keep in mind, I'm born and raised in America). ***What Roman Mars Can Learn about Con Law*** (originally *What Trump Can Teach Us about Con Law*) is a sort of spin-off *99PI* where the host and his neighbor, who happens to be a constitutional law professor, follow the news and talk about how the wild turns of the Trump presidency, and now events following the Trump presidency, intersect with the U.S. Constitution and constitutional jurisprudence (and sometimes just normal laws).\n\nThere are a couple of podcasts that have changed formats so much that they almost feel like spin-offs or re-launches. Season One of ***White Lies*** from NPR was about the murder of a civil rights worker, and in the end it really focused on who did it, which was an important legal and journalistic question, but not the one that really drew my deep attention. Season Two is about the Mariel Boatlift from Cuba and might be the best stand-alone podcast mini-series I've heard since the start of the pandemic.\n\nLikewise, the first seasons of ***Tides of History*** were exploring the early Middle Ages to the Early Modern Period, exclusively in Europe/the Mediterranean World (I think \u2014 I haven't listened to them that much). And that's like, good, cool. Season 4 went all the back to the beginning of human history and has told the story of us emerging as homo-sapiens through the development of agriculture and cities and into the Late Bronze Age collapse. The coolest part is it doesn't just like at this process in the Near East/Europe, but China, Meso-America, North America, South America, New Guinea, Polynesia, Japan, which all seem to have had independent developments of agriculture and (in the case of China, Meso-America, South America) independent developments of cities and states. If you want to start at the beginning of Season 4, start with the episode \"Bones, Stones, and Genomes\" from 2020. Season 5 just continues the story with the Iron Age.",

Dave Anthony wholesale plagiarized scripts for multiple episodes from the website Damn Interesting, a site that - like the Dollop - relays unusual historical events in a bombastic/humorous way. \n\nThe author of the site called Dave out on this and Dave basically did all the shitty stuff plagiarists do when caught: claimed he didn't plagiarize, blamed it on fictitious researchers \"working for him\" that didn't exist, told Damn Interesting they should have been grateful for the attention they got from The Dollop, then acted like he was the victim of a harassment campaign that he would never furnish proof of. \n\nWhile Dave's shitty behavior was somewhat exceptional, the plagiarism really isn't. There are a ton of insanely popular podcasts that are basically \"Two people read a history or crime book/blog/wiki page and throw a few jokes in the margins,\" and many of these shows aren't exactly up front with how much they're cribbing from someone else. \n\nThe Dollop was more noteable though because, if you listen to the episodes with Dave's \"sources\" in-hand (at least at the time, I haven't listened in years) it was pretty obvious that almost all of the original jokes were coming from his co-host, and that Dave was pretty much just reading wikipedia and \"borrowing\" funny asides from other popular history commentators.",

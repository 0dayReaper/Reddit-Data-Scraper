My overriding problem here is that by Eric's account, the efforts to undermine diversity are predicated upon the fact that PJ and others didn't acquiesce to his approach and therefore they actively undermined diversity. In the thread, he clearly states that PJ sees the need for diversity and supports those efforts, but because he didn't support *his* efforts, then he undermined them. That's seriously flawed logic to me. If I don't support someone's efforts because they may have deleterious or unintended consequences, no matter how well intentioned they are, I'm undermining diversity? Isn't that skewed?\n\nIf RA was the flagship show and received disproportionate resources I can understand some people being miffed; but, the issue seems to stem from the fact that Eric fought to unionize the workplace. Those who disagreed with his goals were deemed to be anti-diversity since they predicated their arguments for a union on advancing diversity. That's a convenient way of forcing people to accept your position or receive labelling that may be damaging. You may run into people who not only disagree with your approach but are openly opposed to it. Aren't we supposed to be free to disagree? If Sruthi wants to hold anti-union meetings, she's **absolutely** within her rights to do so. I think calling someone a piece of shit over slack is childish and if you're going to do that, do it to their face. But, I also won't label them as anti-diversity, or regressive, because they have a very different viewpoint. \n\nI'm struggling to see the issues of racism and exclusion here. It's a conveniently constructed narrative that opposing Eric's position is to be against diversity, but that kind of logic is used by Trumpists to peddle bullshit and it seems like people are falling over themselves to agree when they would call the same line of logic as being illogical if it came from someone they generally disagreed with.",

We're getting one side of the story. There are politics at play and it's not always clear why certain things transpired. It could very well be a myriad of reasons why PJ didn't want to push. Simply saying that someone didn't do what you wanted them to do doesn't enable you to put them on blast. Look at his twitter feed now - he's pissed off because the response wasn't what he had hoped for, so he's just ignoring it. \n\nHis whole claim seems to be predicated upon the belief that the union would necessarily make the material changes that would improve people's situation at Gimlet - unless he can prove that to be the case, he's simply tweeting that people didn't agree with him. Have we become a society that must have uniform support for efforts? Simply because someone has some measure of power doesn't mean that's unlimited. I can push certain issues with my boss, but I don't push every issue because I know where I can and can't get leeway and I've learned what works and what doesn't. We don't really know the political-economy of Gimlet; we don't know the situation, all we have are Eric's tweets that are less-than-damning. Some highlights:\n\n[Link to Tweets](https://twitter.com/eeddings/status/1361789128006897668)\n\n&gt; I\u2019ve talked to PJ multiple times asking him to do more to contribute to diversity efforts at the company. Asking him to join the diversity group. To lend a voice when I spoke up at staff meetings. Anything to show the staff that he cared about the issue.\n\n&gt; His response was always that he liked that RA was perceived as a clique or club and that he cared about diversity but would have to think more about how he could get involved beyond his team.\n\n&gt; We went back and forth, I told him specific stories about POC who felt they had been discriminated against, the countless people who felt they had no pathway to promotion and the full scope of what we wanted to achieve. He wasn\u2019t moved.\n\nSo, in short, PJ supports diversity, but didn't know how best to utilze his social capital, and when you discussed the issue, he wasn't ready to fully adopt your slate of options? That's really what we're to deduce? Does it always mean we have to do what we're asked by POC because they asked? Can we not freely agree or disagree based on the prevailing personal, professional and individual circumstances? It seems to me that Eric's intention is to say that PJ failed because he didn't do exactly what was asked of him, and because of that, he aired issues on twitter that resulted in him and Sruthi stepping away. Now that there's blowback, he's muted people, limited responses and walked away. That's all good for him, but did those he indicted merit that response?",

Is it legally obligated that PJ/Sruthi use their position to help advance the causes of POC in their workplace? No, and that's why PJ/Sruthi are not facing legal ramifications. But, is it a moral responsibility to do so? Many people, including probably a majority of RA listeners, would say that it is. And so that's the consequences they're facing. \n\nIf, say, they were making a show that appealed to a highly white and conservative audience, they would probably not be facing many consequences at all, because white conservatives don't really stop consuming products because of an issue like this. But they aren't. They're making a show that has a young, diverse, and urban listener population, and those listeners are free to stop listening for whatever arbitrary standards or reasons they hold. Thus, they're facing ramifications because they didn't meet the standards that their listeners would like them to.\n\nSo, then, the question becomes whether the standards listeners have are a fair standard to hold public figures to. I think this standard could be described as \"actions that perpetuate or permit racism, including failure to act when opportunities existed, are unacceptable\". Personally, I think this is a perfectly fine standard, and it's the standard I try to hold myself to. Anyone is welcome to feel otherwise, as long as they recognize that white passivity has been the dominant force that has and continues to enable racism in society.",

One of the examples given was the soup dumplings article that was first denied to a person of color, however it was later approved to a white person. That is deplorable, however the approval came much later, when the original person already left BA and the approval itself was done by a different leader. Bringing that story up as a main argument does not give me the feeling Sruthi did a good job getting to the bottom of the story. Additionally, not giving the aggressors any place in the podcast is also a weird choice to me. My expectation of the podcast was to understand what happened, and not giving the other side a (small) place for their part of the story doesnt help. So the podcast seemed to be written very one sided and with an predetermined outcome. It's too bad, as of course the people at ba wont quit without reason so to me there is no need to provide an argument. An actual reporting of the history would have been much more interesting to me.",

She uses this example to show there was a culture of discrimination even if he was doing it with most people. This is an example of a toxic environment, not discrimination.\n\nI had this strong feeling that she tried to prove her theory and was only looking for evidence going to that direction. There are some evidence of racism however - the shitty comment from a manager that one worker didn't have to put any effort to make Mexican recipes, because he's from Mexican origine- and it would have been interesting to dig to this direction.\n\nEdit: edit necessary because of my poor English skills",

Cliques will inevitably form in any society (however large, small, specialised, or diverse) and no one is saying that is a bad thing. When the clique, however, disrupts *the rest of the workplace*, that *is* an issue.

I'm struggling with what appears to be the intention to say that if you don't actively support an individual's efforts, that can be deemed racist. I understand the petty, childish BS and clique-like behavior, but beyond that, I'm struggling to see what the issue is. \n\nIf Reply All is the flagship Gimlet media, I understand people's unwillingness to fuck with the formula or to to disproportionately provide resources. Eric's contention is that if you have a platform, it *has* to necessarily be an activist platform (\"duty\") and I don't think that's true, fair or accurate. The onus is not on a specific person to do what Eric thinks is right - Eric isn't the sole arbiter of racial justice and equality. Moreover, people can perceive Eric's steps to be a threat to their endeavors. Eric seems to be saying that he got into a pissing match because some people didn't want to unionized, disagreed with him and took a different approach. How exactly is that racist? \n\nAre you saying that if someone in my working world tells me that I should do X, but if I don't do X, then I'm somehow not contributing to equality, is a fair and accurate assessment, then I strongly disagree. We can go after people who acted like children and used a slack channel like angsty tweens DM each other, but I'm getting really tired of the implication that not supporting someone is tantamount to racism. If I went into work and tried to make several major changes, I would run-up against a fair bit of opposition, and I would anticipate it could ruin relationships. \n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Maybe there is more context to this. But I'm having a really hard time with Eric Eddings' tweets, and struggling with their implication.",

The point I was trying to make was this....\n\nLet\u2019s say there\u2019s a company Susie and Johnny are in and they are doing well... Jackson comes in and says Susie and Johnny aren\u2019t being fair because they aren\u2019t letting him be part of their team.... well that\u2019s in Susie and Johnny right. It\u2019s nothing personal probably, just that S&amp;J have something that\u2019s working between them, maybe they don\u2019t want to rock the boat or try to fix what ain\u2019t broke.

Creative fields may not have such measures but one's hard work through resume, observation and reference fall under merit. And these are things that are factored \"under the hood\"...but something tells me these phenomenons, also,  don't occur to people only interested in virtue signaling and grinding their axe.",

    "postText": "Reproducing the entire write up by Ira Glass on TAL fb page\nBefore full text, Here\u2019s the episode link https://www.thisamericanlife.org/688/the-out-crowd\n\nIra here. I\u2019m thrilled to tell you that This American Life just won the very first Pulitzer Prize ever given to audio journalism. \n \nFor years now, we\u2019ve been doing serious reporting, including investigative stories. It\u2019s gratifying to be recognized by the Pulitzers for that side of our work. \n \nThe episode that won, \u201cThe Out Crowd,\u201d ran last November and is about the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. When we started putting it together we knew that elements of that policy had been covered by the press. But a lot of that coverage had come out in drips and drops, as the wonky specifics of the policy changed. Most listeners \u2013 hell, most of our own families and friends \u2013 had not put together what the policies really meant: tens of thousands of asylum seekers stranded on the other side of the border in shelters, on the streets, and in makeshift encampments. Many get kidnapped by the cartels, in areas the State Department classifies as being as violent and unsafe as Syria and Iraq. \n \nWe wanted to document the emotional truth of that, building stories around characters and scenes and story arcs like we have in all our shows. So the episode includes a piece of investigative reporting by Los Angeles Times reporter Molly O\u2019Toole, produced by Nadia Reiman, where she interviewed asylum officers who talked about their discomfort enforcing the policy. She documented the fact that many of them were resigning. There\u2019s also a story by Emily Green, produced by Lina Misitzis, built around remarkable recordings of cartels negotiating ransom for the release of a father and son who\u2019d been kidnapped immediately after being returned to Mexico under the Trump administration\u2019s policy. I reported, with Aviva DeKornfeld, at one of the squalid tent camps that\u2019s sprung up just across the border. \n \nNadia Reiman produced the episode, with help from Aviva DeKornfeld. Editing from David Kestenbaum, Susan Burton, Ben Calhoun, and others. Fact-checking by Christopher Swetala, Michelle Harris, and Ben Phelan. Mixing by Matt Tierney, Stowe Nelson, and Katherine Rae Mondo. And it really was a group effort for the entire staff, including managers and administrative staff who handled logistics.\n \nIt\u2019s an honor to be recognized this way by the Pulitzers. And exciting to win their very first prize for audio reporting. Fun fact: the Peabody Awards were established in 1940 partly because the Pulitzers wouldn\u2019t give out awards to this newfangled medium called radio. \n \nI guess they decided audio journalism is finally here to stay.",

I like the show and it's great they won that prize for sure but it does like in today's world, they hand out Nobel peace awards, and pulitizers and things like that to very politically driven events or articles. Maybe that's just because that's what is so big in our world today",

I lean left in a lot of ways (most ways really) but if I say something that might sound a little \"right thinking\" id be cast as a party traitor or turn coat because today's politics are so extreme that either party makes you feel like, you're either 100% with them or you're 100% against them. No middle ground. It ties into these awards too. You say something like you did where you say, hey I liked the episode but they left some important details out and I don't know if they should have won a Pulitzer, now you get downvoted. It's hard to really even just have conversations about this stuff because people get so damn defensive and can never admit that maybe there's some room for improvement or hey maybe some of that is bullshit. I liked Obama but I can still look at the facts and admit that he enacted some pretty heinous war acts. I'm rambling now and I'm heading to bed.",

I didn't know asylum seekers have to apply for citizenship in the countries they cross. That's interesting. \n\nIt's still a failure of this administration. \n\n\nhttps://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/requiring-migrants-to-apply-for-asylum-in-the-first-country-they-enter-may-not-resolve-the-central-american-crisis-2/",

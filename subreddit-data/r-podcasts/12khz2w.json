    "postText": "Hi, recently I've been going through a phase exploring old classic TV series I'd never seen before (Sopranos, Northern Exposure, St. Elsewhere etc.). \n\nDoes anyone know of any good podcasts that cover classic TV series (not just, but not excluding, contemporary ones - but preferably those that have finished, and preferably without major spoilers, though I realise this might be a bit much to ask) and talks about e.g. cultural/technical importance and innovation, influence on other series, what made them unique etc.\n\nBasically akin to how an art history podcast might have episodes featuring specific paintings or sculptures etc.\n\nI've had a quick browse around but couldn't really find anything that matches the above criteria, most I've found just seem to concentrate on contemporary TV.\n\n*Note to mods: for some reason when I was entering the title of the post, it automatically wrote it in Title Case, but I see now that this was all a ruse and it's lower-cased it all...*",

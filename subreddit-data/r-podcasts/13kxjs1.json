            "comment": "Tides of history has a prehistory season about the history of humanity from its origin (last common ancestor with chimpanzees 6 million years ago) to the end of the bronze age.  I cannot recommend this enough.\n\nLiterature and History - Explores history through literature.  Each episode the host describes the contents of a piece of literature and the historical context in which it was created.  The episodes are in chronological order and the earliest episodes explore the first literature produced in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, greece etc.  This is my favorite podcast of all time.\n\nFall of Civilizations - Some of the episodes explore the rise an fall of civilizations in the time period you are interested in.\n\nHistory in the Bible - Explores the stories in the bible, who wrote the stories, and the context of the writing of the stories.  This covers a lot of good history of the areas you are interested in.",

            "comment": "Here's a decent list. Overlaps with other replies, but I'll try to explain what's good with each:\n\n0) **History of Rome**: you already listen. nice. it's the model for other history podcasts.\n\n0.5) **Myths and Legends** is a nice gateway podcast to hear modernized retellings of ancient stories, many from the civs you care about. When you want to take the same premise a step further with analysis and info, I recommend **Literature and History**\n\n1) **History of the World Podcast**. Broad podcast that spans all of humanity. Starts millions of years ago. S1 is the evolution of humanity you wanted till ~6000BCE, and S2 starts with the civilizations that arose from there. I recommend those seasons.\n\n2) **Oldest Stories Podcast**. You want Mesopotamian myths that are as academically accurate as possible, with the associated history? You got it. And his episodes that expand into Anatolian / Levantine areas are equally top-notch.\n\n3) **History of Egypt**. Egypt is a such a core civ that connected Mesopotamian, Greek, and Caananite civs (i.e. practically all of Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean) with Africa. This podcast does it justice.\n\n4) **History of Africa**. S1 is about Egypt, S2 is about Ethiopia (whose rain clouds flood the Nile), and moves on from there. Pairs really well with History of Egypt to tie more African geopolitics to other continents.\n\n5) **Maritime History Podcast**. I cannot stress enough how unique this podcast is. It spans all the civs you care about from pre-history onward, but shows how water wasn't a barrier but rather a highway for interactions and a glue for politics.\n\n6) **Fall of Civilizations Podcast**. Instant classic imo. His narrative flow is so immersive, I get chills with every episode I listen to, even on re-listen. Pairs with anything else well.\n\n7) **Tides of History**. As others have mentioned, it's fantastic. Slowly growing to be a favorite. It fills in a LOT of gaps that every other podcast leaves out. That said, I think it's easier to digest when you already have context from other podcasts. This last point was a reason it didn't start as a favorite of mine, but pairs with anything else well.\n\n8) **History of India**. Not as focused or academically rigorous as the others, but probably the best podcast out there for Indian history and stories. Also ties in well with Greek history, especially because it's the Eastern-most branch of the Indo-European languages that Tides of History brings up well. This podcast also has a few sparse, indirect references to Mesopotamian events.\n\n9) **Celtic Myth Podshow** is a true pleasure of mine. Might have even started before the History of Rome podcast. Again, it's not as rigorous, but truthfully, we don't have a lot of academic info about Celtic/pre-Celtic religion. These stories hint at the myths that existed before the Indo-European migrant descendants pushed toward England. \n\n10) **History of English Podcast**. Linguistic podcast that really comes to life when you pair with other podcasts about regions that contributed to English (mostly Greek, Latin, Germanic, which are again all Indo-European)\n\n11) **Reimagining Atlantis**. Warning: don't listen to this podcast carelessly. Her personal opinions and theories are recognizably incorrect, but she presents a lot of primary source material that most other podcasts don't. In other words, her modern research about Greek and Phoenicians and her references to ancient historians are top-notch, but her personal conclusions are very much the opposite.\n\n12) **Trojan War Podcast**. It feels like both a starter and refresher podcast. Starter because it's pretty much all mythical narrative in modernized terms. Refresher because it's presented chronologically and thoroughly (unlike the Iliad and associated stories), so you can see how narrative changes over time relate to the political needs of each successive Greek age. \n\nP.S. notes:\n\nNote 1: I'm woefully ignorant of ancient Asian / American podcasts (Tides of History comes closest). Hopefully someone else can chime in here.\n\nNote 2: It's Sumer, not Sumeria.\n\nNote 3: Most of these podcasters have Patreon accounts with additional content. If accessible for you, I recommend.\n\n**Note 4: Instead of binging each podcast sequentially, I recommend searching through each podcast for the topics you care about and grouping themed episodes across them (e.g. by era, tech, civ, etc.). Personally, I learn a lot this way.**\n\nNote 5: There are a lot of youtube channels and audiobooks that also pair up with each podcast well. I know this is not the right subreddit for those, so I'm not linking them but I still recommend you look them up :)\n\nEdit: wrt your title, anything Levantine and Caananite should reference the Phoenicians. The Caananites in the Levantine region split into Israelites a bit more south and Phoenicians a bit more north (who also migrated west on the Med sea)\n\nEdit 2: added (12)",

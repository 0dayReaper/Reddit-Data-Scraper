It\u2019s unlike anything else I\u2019ve listened to since. It\u2019s extremely sexually graphic at times, so be careful where you listen to it.\n\nI know you already mentioned it, but The Magnus Archives is worth mentioning again. I recently re-listened knowing how it ends and it\u2019s amazing how much lore was in there right from the beginning. \n\nWelcome to Night Vale, at least the first few seasons. Imagine if every episode of The Twilight Zone took place in the same desert town. Now imagine what their NPR news program would sound like, with the most beautiful voiced host imaginable.",

The McElroy brothers of My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast fame decided to play D&amp;D along with their dad Clint and broadcast it. It was so popular that they gave it its own broadcast, and the adventure zone was born. It starts off with just a lot of joking and fairly normal DND play, but the dungeon master, Griffin, quickly comes up with a story arc that is just amazing. I never played D&amp;D, and I became totally obsessed with this podcast, and in fact, immediately went back and listened to all the episodes over again when it was done.\nEdit for spelling of McElroy.",

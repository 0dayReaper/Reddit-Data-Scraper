    "postText": "My daughter and I recently came across Six Minutes and have gotten through the first 60ish episodes. Listening to them back to back though turns an ~6 minute segment plus opening, closing, occasional commercials bumps it to 10-12 minutes each.  I was hoping that maybe when the show wrapped a super cut was released and my google-fu was failing me.  Does anyone know if a compilation was made?",

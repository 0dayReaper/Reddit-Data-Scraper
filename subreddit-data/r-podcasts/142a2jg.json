    "postText": "Hi!  \nI'm a huge audiophile and a fan of Night vale/Magnus archives/Archive 81, as well as of radioplays (Sherlock Holmes with Clive Merrisson is THE THING). Atmosphere is the main thing for me, as well as thinking people solving puzzles.  \n Can you please recommend to me something like that in French? (I hope that if I will listen to french podcasts 5 hours a day that will help my french). either an audiodrama or a radioplay based on a book.  \nI've tried searching myself but found something either  very old and extremely difficult (like Furax series, though they are hilarious) or something with a lot of screaming and empty talks (like Queens of Snake. Sorry if you're a fan, I dont mean anything, just not my cup of tea) or one-episode thing (like Rouge Vif).   \n\n\nAnd if you can recommend me ANY podcast (I mean podcast like audiodrama/radioplay, not people talking about random stuff in a studio) in JAPANESE  I will be grateful from here to the Moon and back and dance a dance in your honor.",

It's awesome.\n\nTechnique:\n\n- Skype with 2 hosts, 1-2 guests, video enabled\n- Use a capture region in OBS for each person's video feed, send that to YouTube\n- YouTube chat sucks ass, so we have a channel in a related Slack team\n- social media announcements have two calls to action: live stream URL, and Slack join instructions\n\nExample: https://powershell.org/2017/01/03/up-next-don-jones-adam-bertram-on-the-pester-book/\n\nEdit: here's what the videos look like https://youtu.be/ubZzkD7dxNk\n\n",

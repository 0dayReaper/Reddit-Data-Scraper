I first learned of it from the 90 Day Fiance scenes reaction videos he started doing during pandemic times. From there found out he also had that long running podcast that explores many more issues. He speaks a lot about attachment theory and how that can affect one's relationships and reactions later in life. Since he is also teacher for other therapists, he's very good at explaining psychological theories and concepts in a way that's easy for laypeople to digest (and sometimes using popular reality TV show conflict scenes as an example basis to do so).",

            "comment": "For pure cognitive behavioral therapy, i sometimes listen to Dr David Burns\u2019 podcast, \u201cFeeling Good.\u201d He targets therapists but also answers questions from the public. He\u2019s a former Stanford psychiatrist who learned about CBT from one of the greats in the field. Decades ago he started trying to show patients how to do it themselves. \n\nIt is very \u201cauthentic\u201d, meaning they don\u2019t do a lot of editing and it\u2019s not slick. So it can feel a little slow at times. But I usually learn something and appreciate his doing it.\n\nSlight heads up that he might say meds are risky except in cases of serious mental illness. My take is that he thinks people would benefit greatly from using CBT before altering their brain chemistry. It doesn\u2019t diminish my respect for his techniques",

It\u2019s very relatable and they provide helpful tips on dealing with anxiety, social pressures, etc. I personally love hearing the listener submitted social scenarios and their take on how to tackle them through a therapist\u2019s perspective.",

He has had very interesting guests like Bjarne (the C++ creator), stuff about AI and AGI etc. That is really good stuff and highly recommended, but the non-technical stuff:\n\nHe gave West airtime at a time, where it did nobody any favours, since West is clearly sick. He tends to maybe end up giving really bad people airtime, because he seems to believe everyone deserves to be heard. That is a very beautiful thought, but deeply naive. His relationship to Musk is very interesting, but he seems almost comically unable to critically analyse.  \n\n\nLex reminds me of the priest played by Mads Mikkelsen in the 2005 film \"Adam's Apples\". This priest has some kind of decease that makes him mentally and physically unable to see negative stuff, which ends up with situations like the priest justifying somebody shooting a cat by saying that cat was getting old. Clearly an incredibly smart guy, but dangerously naive.",

There is even a moment where they get into a full on shouting match. I think if Lex was a more competent debater, bringing on dangerous views could lend itself to a more nuanced discussion as long as Lex pushes back appropriately. \n\nWest is definitely not acting in his own interests because he's clearly not well but I think Lex's intentions were definitely to challenge West in a lower key way and become his friend in order to try and facilitate change in him. It clearly didn't work, and it's questionable that it did anything good, but I don't think Lex himself has any overly-problematic views (other than being a pipeline part of the manosphere culture)",

I just watched an interview he did a bit ago with Richard Wolff. A scholar and professor of economics at UMass I believe. And a marxist. \n\nNow I know Lex doesn't share a lot of Wolffs beliefs on capitalism. However he hardly pushed back on anything he was saying and just asked him questions letting him give his analysis. \n\nPart of this is his style (which most should respect) but part of it is I'm sure he is aware of the knowledge Wolff has on the whole economic system given he has studied the system his entire adult life and has the humility to sit back and observe, which he did pretty much all podcast. Now this doesn't look like him believing he is \"smarter than he is\" as you said.\n\nTo this point, Jordan Peterson, in a conversation with a marxist intellectual, would be giving many more counter arguments on both economics and society. Lex seems to have much more humility on subjects he knows he is not an expert on.",

He can't seem to connect with dating partners. I get it. It is awful out there for those looking to find mates. He occasionally posts photos of females that are Photoshopped (AI now), so he may have a distorted view of females and what he seeks. He gives off weird vibes sometimes. I suppose each of us does.",

However, unlike Rogan, and probably most of the posters here, he's got a phd in Computer Science, and a deep understanding of AI and physics.  He's singularly equipped to discuss all of the goings on for AI and the risks.  The 3 podcasts surrounding Sam Altman's appearance on the show highlight just how much more in depth his show is.\n\nRegarding him being \"na\u00efve\", I much prefer to see him as someone who is always open to hearing other opinions.  Unlike Rogan, or Sam Harris, or Jordan Peterson, all recent guest, and all very opinionated, often far beyond their areas of expertise, Friedman seems both ready and more adept at questioning and/or challenging his guest's positions than anyone I'm listening to.  The Kayne interview is a perfect cast in point.  Although I couldn't possibly listen to that guy ramble on and on (Kanye), I caught enough to see Lex very patiently, but unalterably, defending his philosophy of openness and love, versus Kayne's uneducated, uninformed attacks on an entire religion, simply because he met a couple of bad guys who practice that religion.\n\nYou can enjoy him, or criticize him, but mistaking his choice to be an open, friendly guy, when he's also usually the smartest guy in the room, is one of the things I personally find esteem able about the guy...",

If you can see past things like that (which you should strive to do) he does have some pretty great interviews. Usually the interviews aren't great because of his input, but just because of the interviewee and the subject matter.\n\nCouldn't hurt to listen to a few but again, YMMV (intended joke).",

            "comment": "I love his podcasts and watch almost all of them. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s naive as others suggested. He makes his guests comfortable, and mostly listens. I\u2019ve learned so much about so many topics from guests speaking on poker, the Amazon, Mexican cartel, CIA ops, AGI. I appreciate his style(?) as an Interviewer.. listening respectfully to people you disagree, even strongly disagree with. He exudes a calmness and curiosity that\u2019s contagious. You can tell when he\u2019s having fun and is extra engaged in topics, like his interview with Liv Boeree re-poker, game theory, AI simulation was so much fun to listen to. I think the nieve comments are from people who prefer debates on hot topics with a hosts that match strongly with their own views and intentionally invite antagonistic guests.Lex isn\u2019t that host. He has strong views, and has guests he disagrees with. He has guests I dislike (Jordan Peterson   \ud83e\udd2e) that one was kinda cringe for me bc I could tell Lex respects him and I don\u2019t. I listened and appreciated the somewhat challenging  questions  Lex asked. I dont need a host that agrees with me on everything and pushes my ideologies. He has libertarian views but his interviews with Steve Keen on Marxism was incredibly informative one of my favorites. I liked how in depth they went with defining communism, and emphasizing Marxism as a critique on capitalism not a how to Communism, and went deep into world history. I consider myself a progressive libertarian who is dealing with our reality, but if I thought socialism was an actual possibility in our society I could get on board. I was \ud83d\udcaf full on Bernie until Dems rigged the primaries and Supreme Court decided that\u2019s legal. Anyway.. my point I guess is maybe I relate to Lex and enjoy his interview style bc I don\u2019t have black white views on politics, and My ideas often contradict each other. I can engage with people who disagree with me even on really decisive topics. I enjoy exploring ideas in depth and am Ok if my views are challenged even changed. \n\nTLDR I really really enjoy his podcasts bc of the in-depth dives we take into things I never would have spent time pondering\n\nEditing to add- if it\u2019s a topic I might not be into (bc they are long) I\u2019ll skim the notes and watch some of the Lex clips, read through the time stamp notes and skip around to certain specific topics. Like Jordan Peterson. I cant stand the guy and I realize I noted above that I watched it.. kind of a lie. I couldn\u2019t stomach Jordan taking so much so I watched 3ish sections I was interested in.  \nMy favorites have been- AI (the ones from past 1 year), poker (Daniel something and Liv omg so fascinating), chess (even though I\u2019m not at all a player or a poker player) The Amazon guy (jungle not corporation), and a few on consciousness, reality etc",

Really, I like Lex a lot as a guy, but as a podcast host I don't think he's as smart as he (or others) think he is, and a lot of times he seems like he's trying too hard to be something...like a kid who wants to hang with the older kids. That being said, I do enjoy his podcast (listened today at the gym, actually), and I don't disparage the guy at all - I'm sure doing a podcast, especially involving the topics and guests Lex has - is not easy and that over time he'll grow into it. He's definitely a genuine guy with no pretense as far as I can tell, though. A bit naive, sure, but a genuinely good dude.",

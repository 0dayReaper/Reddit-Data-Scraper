    "postText": "I'm so sorry to see that Heather Armstrong from Dooce has died. She was so huge in the world of blogging. I even remember watching her husband on Jeopardy. A lot of stuff happened in the past few years that I'm not caught up on. Other bloggers cut off friendships, she did experimental depression treatment etc, from what I gather. Are there podcasts that discuss Dooce or discuss blogging or mommy stuff?",

(Heather publicly rejected her child's nonbinary gender identity, she wasn't ideologically a radical feminist.) They did a follow up where they talked to Heather's Manic Rambling Spiral co-host John R. Bray. IIRC he was largely left hanging in terms of the fate of the podcast and their friendship in general. Heather just kinda fell off the map.\n\nThe Trend Lightly podcast is very harsh It makes me cringe to think about listening to it now.",

I read her blog religiously years ago but had lost track of her. Had no idea she was dealing with treatment-resistant depression.",

She always wrote openly about her mental health struggles, especially postpartum depression, on the blog and in her published books. 2020 Quarantine saw a lot of erratic behavior from her in her community; she tried to setup these virtual happy hours but leaked details indicated a lot of gatekeeping of the invitation list and wasted attendees and it all just kind of imploded. In the last two years, she revealed a substance use disorder and struggles with alcohol dependency that she'd hidden/denied all along and started a public sobriety journey - seemingly a pretty white-knuckled approach without much of a formal program or support. She also claimed she stopped taking whatever mood stabilizing meds she was on. Her younger child came out as non-binary and, after having long been a relative liberal and queer ally, Heather started posting really heartbreaking anti-trans/TERF content that demonstrated increasingly erratic thought patterns. She deleted most of it (though it lives on in the WayBack already linked) but even her last post celebrating her older kid misgenders her younger one. \n\nI'll stop. I hope this is helpful.",

I am looking for podcasts mainly from a somewhat scientific / professional point of view.\n\nWhat I am not looking for is podcasts that focus on \"the community\", what I mean by that is things like representation in films, and oh look at my stim teddy bear I just bought.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I'd recommend steering away from evolutionary psychology. Most, if not all, it's hypotheses can't truly be proven. They don't often account for how our modern and capitalist society affects our psychology. \n\nAn example is how men and women choose mates. Evolutionary psychologists think that women are more picky than men because evolutionary speaking, they need to, to care for their young they need a man who can provide for them, and not waste their time/eggs unlike men who can just go for quantity over quality. They often don't take account how women often choose this because of our patriarchal society, where they often need support. \n\nIf we were back thousands of years ago. Women might not be as picky for mates because they'd have the rest of the tribe/ group to help. But then again, even I'm just making a theory, just like them, it's almost impossible to prove their reasoning.",

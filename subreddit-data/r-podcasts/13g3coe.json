    "postText": "I really enjoyed the first season, thought it did a fantastic job tracing the history of MLMs, the techniques they use to suck people in, and (most importantly) why it's all a scam. As such, I was excited to listen to season two, thinking that the creators of the podcast would be applying the same rigorous level of audio-journalism to another industry that takes advantage of people's ignorance and enthusiasm, wellness. I don't know what happened between the two seasons but it feels like suddenly the host wants to make it about her and her partner. Almost every episode has what feels like filler of her trying out different wellness treatments. Honestly, it feels like she wants to be the star. In the first season there was someone going through an MLM program and it was great because one got the chance to understand firsthand what so many other MLM users were going through. In season two the navel gazing anecdotes about the host's wellness treatments adds nothing. Likewise, the episodes feel extremely unstructured in terms of the story they're trying to tell. What a dissapointment.",

Like, maybe just change the podcast to a different name and do one-two episode features on different scams. That way she can make it more about herself and Mr. Modest Mouse and they can have their niche little fan audience for that style. \n\nIt\u2019s like when Radiohead went electronic. I don\u2019t hate electronic Radiohead, I just like rock Radiohead better. Change the name of the band, and we\u2019re good to go! \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude05",

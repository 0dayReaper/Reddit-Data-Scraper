    "postText": "Darknet Diaries is the best podcast i\u2019ve found this year. I love the intrigue of true crime but stopped listening to true crime podcasts because: 1. I do not want to give infamy to murderers. And 2. Filling my head with their stories every day makes me depressed. for years i\u2019ve looked for a podcast which possessed the mystery without the nihilism. And that is Darknet Diaries. The score, the narration, &amp; the stories are all incredible. If you haven\u2019t already, check it out.",

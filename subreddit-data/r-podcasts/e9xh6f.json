For the moment with me it\u2019s The Magnus Archives (even though fiction isn\u2019t my thing). Other faves I\u2019ve worked my way through are The Omnibus and Ben Franklin\u2019s World. Something when your feed seems dried up you can go back to and find a new-to-you episode. Love it.\n\nEdit: Can\u2019t stress enough how great Ben Franklin\u2019s World is for the fellow Early American History buffs out there. Outstanding.",

A few days ago I genuinely laughed so hard I had tears streaming down my face and my stomach hurt - that almost never happens even when I find things hilarious.

I played dungeons and dragons for six months like twenty years ago and really enjoyed myself but not since, so it hardly counts. I will say this about it: it\u2019s very easy for someone who hasn\u2019t played or doesn\u2019t have much experience with tabletop gaming to follow along and understand. Alex Newall (Martin from Magnus) is the GM (runs the game) and he\u2019s really, *really* good at it. Excellent world building, knows how to guide the players while still giving them full autonomy, he\u2019s just masterful. The players are super funny and quick witted and you\u2019ll recognize a couple voices from Magnus too - Ben Meredith (Elias Bouchard) and Lydia Nicholas (Melanie King). They have so much fun you can\u2019t help but grin the whole time, and the plot of the story they\u2019re playing is also well planned and intriguing. Honestly, when you\u2019re caught up on Magnus, give the first two or three episodes a listen. It\u2019s not something I thought I\u2019d be super into but it\u2019s just been an absolute delight. You might thank me!",

They have video + podcast version, I'd highly recommend the video.  They set the standard for an excellent roleplay-heavy campaign.\n* **Glass Cannon**  \\- Pathfinder system - High fantasy, best blend of drama/comedy out there, it gets absolutely epic and deep as it continues!  Along with Critical Role, Glass Cannon is my favorite, and they now have a network with four shows (two public, and two behind Patreon donation walls).  \n* **Campaign / Sky Jacks** \\- Starts as Star Wars Edge of Empire, transitions into new Genesys homebrew. Played by improv comics from Chicago.  Star Wars = hilarious comedy with heart, Sky Jacks = drama/comedy.\n* **Orpheus Protocol** \\- Homebrew - Horror genre, think X-Files meets Magnus Archives, it's amazing.  Has a genuinely creepy feel, and players are excellent at riffing and being creative with each other in character.\n* **Warda** \\- Modified \"Fate\" system - Think Game of Thrones meets Downton Abbey, amazing worldbuilding where hierarchical system where Fey creates run the world and humans on lowest end of the ladder.  Big on roleplay and not on combat, all about the politic-ing between houses/families in this world.\n* **Friends at the Table** \\- Dungeon World system - High Fantasy, great characters and worldbuilding.  Make sure to head to their subreddit to check out where to start as there are several entry points you can try.\n* **The Broadswords** \\- D&amp;D 5e - High fantasy but with mystical, magic, witches, fey, dream-like vibe.  Sound rough at first but then improves, fantastic GM and they build an amazing story.\n* **Sounds Like Crowes** \\- Savage Worlds system - Wild West + Steampunk + Creepy horror.  Some of best chemistry between players out there.\n\nThe Adventure Zone, Not Another D&amp;D Podcast, Drunks n Dragons, Godsfall are other popular ones, but I'm more into drama or drama/comedy ones than straight comedy usually (except Campaign, which is one of the funniest things ever made).  **Turncloaks** is also really good for more of a dark fantasy drama, and **Venture Maidens** is also one that's become very popular, that is wonderful (it picks up big time after 15-18 episodes or so when the real story kicks off).\n\nOther great ones in the Pathfinder system (Rusty Quill Gaming uses this) besides Glass Cannon are:\n\n* **Find the Path**\n* **A Pod Called Quest** &lt;--amazing sound design",

You say the intro/joke 10 different ways and pick the best one. But instead of picking the best one, they leave all 10 in there. \n\n\"Shut up and give me murder\" is so true, because 90% of the time I am dying for them to finish their joke so I can hear the rest of the story. The stories they pick are so interesting. \n\nI don't want to give it up, I like it. But uuuuuugh, the jokes. Ugh.",

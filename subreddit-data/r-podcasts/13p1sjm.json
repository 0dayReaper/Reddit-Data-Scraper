    "postText": "I\u2019ve been going through a depressive episode of late and speaking with my therapist, she suggested listening to some podcasts to listen to when I go out on my daily walk as I\u2019m not much of a reader and have some difficulty with memory/concentration/motivation to read a book at the moment. \n\nLooking for any recommendations especially anything uplifting, where I\u2019m learning something new ie history or facts, funny/comedy, feel good, sci-fi movies/TV shows - anything you think is your go to/feel good podcast etc. Open to any genre and/or topic/subject. Recently listened to Answer Me This, Lorehounds and A-Z of the 90s.\n\nEdit - didn\u2019t expect so many replies so thank you all for your recommendations and taking time out of your day to post. You\u2019re all lovely people!",

Highly enjoyable regardless of whether you're an experienced player or at all familiar with role-playing games. There are 4 different campaigns, so you can jump into a fantasy quest, a comics-flavored superhero story, a cryptid summer camp, or an adventure set on a planet with sentient plants.\n\nMeddling Adults: talented grownups compete to solve Scooby-Doo and Encyclopedia Brown-style mysteries. Great fun and they raise money for charity while doing it.\n\nExolore: a show about worldbuilding hosted by Moiya McTier, who is not only a scientist but also a folklorist and has THE warmest voice in podcasting. It's a delight.",

SWW skews darker of course, some way more serious than others but some seasons and singular episodes are basically glorified gossip. \n\nScamfluencers hosts also have a similar vibe to Kelsey McKinney IMO and it is on the lighter side of True Crime.",

The guys at Asshole Court (AHC Podcast) have a male version of this kind of vibe too, although they deal with notorious people they are affable and chatty. And Underunderstood might be worth checking out for a similar vibe.",

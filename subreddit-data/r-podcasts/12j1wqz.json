The one where he took woman to a sound proof trailer he made on his property and when the women would wake up strapped to a torture table he\u2019d have a creepy audio of him playing that told them in graphic, sickening detail what they had awaiting them there, including that he would be having his dog rape her. I had to turn it off after that last bit. It was very detailed and I\u2019ve never felt that level of vicarious trauma/terror before or since. I want absolutely no more knowledge of the Toy Box Killer.",

I had to pause it a few times just to...stop, for a minute, and take a breather.\n\nAnyway, if you want to get wrecked on your morning commute or whatever, this is for you.",

For the week after listening, I'd think \"if he could still push through and walk, I can do this workout without stopping\". \n\nY'all, it's affecting alright. Just beware if you listen, it's extremely graphic. There were so many \"holy shit!\u201d moments, it's well worth the listen. It will stick with me for a long time, I'm sure of it. \n\nThanks for making this post OP, I've not had a chance to reflect on it with someone else that listened. My husband wouldn't listen due to the graphic stuff.",

I just gave the episode number for them to listen to themselves. \n\nI want to re listen to it now!",

No explanation does this episode justice so if you haven\u2019t listened, just do it.\n\nIt is a bit graphic, but that is not what sticks out about this episode\u2026 for me, anyways. It\u2019s more the intensity of this man\u2019s emotion and his details/storytelling that got me. Very compelling story.",

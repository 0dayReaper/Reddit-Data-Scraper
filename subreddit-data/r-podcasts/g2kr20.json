    "postText": "I've always enjoyed podcasts, but I've had to be selective about what I dedicated my time to since some podcasts can easily stretch to an hour or longer. I skipped out on a lot of interesting podcasts as a result\n\nA week or so ago I posted on here asking how people can listen at 2x speed, since it seems pretty fast. After reading some of the responses, I gave it a try for myself, and, surprisingly, I could keep up and understand what I was listening to with no problems (it's only an issue if someone has a thick accent, or if someone is speaking over the phone and sounds fuzzy)\n\nSince I can get through things a lot faster now, I've found myself trying out all sorts of new podcasts (and even older ones I neglected). Wish I would have tried this sooner, but damn, can't wait to see what else I discover now",

That included listening to podcasts at normal speed again.\n\nBecause life isn't a race to the finish line",

You even get a real-time playback speed counter. So I may be listening to someone at 2x and when they're talking the speedometer will show 2.01x or 2.02x but that can get up to 2.50x or 2.80x if someone is pausing to think a lot or two people are having a conversation with lots of pauses. \n\nOvercast even tells you how many hours Smart Speed has saved you beyond speed adjustments alone. I've saved 58 hours this way. Although it's unclear whether that's 58 hours if I were listening at 1x speed - since I'm listening at 2x mostly it may be more like 29 hours saved. \n\nI'm also not convinced that my retention is all that great at 2x but now it's painful listening to anything in real time. I even feel like I speak stupidly slow because I'm used to listening at 2x+.",

I listen to Podcasts / just people talking on 1.2x / 1.5x speed. My brain is always racing so I need to speed up the conversation.

It's good, but it gets old after you've heard the same rehashed talking points a dozen times. \n\nI'd definately recommend \"Stoicism on Fire\" if you want to dive deep, but it's pretty involved and fairly scholarly, no \"quick and easy lifehacks\" there. Really good exploration of the ancients, especially Epictetus.",

Doesn't have to be completely academic, but I would like it to skew more informational than entertaining. But a little humor never hurts.\n\n If anyone has recs that relate I would love to hear them. Thanks!",

The host has a really gentle voice, not the kind of podcast where you need to skip a bunch of annoying intro music or updates, or unnecessary banter, etc. I find it really calming lol. It\u2019s my palate cleanser podcast at the moment. The host picks unusual animals and discusses the kinds of things you mentioned. He also has a subtle and sometimes sarcastic? sense of humour, which I really like. It instantly became a favourite of mine. I tried to listen to creature feature because it always gets recommended for this kind of podcast request, but it did nothing for me. I forget what they were talking about, but I remember something they said wasn\u2019t accurate and I thought that if I, someone who is not an expert, could pick that out, it did not bode well. Someone said the host is an evolutionary specialist or something, so maybe the detail just wasn\u2019t evolution oriented. Tooth and claw is good, lots of banter and stuff but actually pretty funny, not usually unique animals, but so far the 10 or so episodes I\u2019ve listened to have still been really interesting.",

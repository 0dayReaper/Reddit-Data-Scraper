Detta and Corey have such entertaining banter that is warm and inquisitive while also sensitive to the subject matter at hand. They respect varying cultures and are great examples of how to be curious without being a colonizer. What podcasts do you recommend that are similar? leave a comment below!",

It's another fairly academic podcast around the esoteric in late antiquity if you aren't familiar. Rejected Religion sounds exactly like what I was looking for!",

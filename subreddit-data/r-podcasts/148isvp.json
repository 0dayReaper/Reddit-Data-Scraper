    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI'm looking for a new podcast.  I love interviews with interesting people.  The big issue is that the big podcasts that I know about, WTF with Mark Maron, Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend, etc...they are terrible interviewers, IMHO.  The format is more conversational, and not really a good Q&amp;A format.  \n\nI LOVE Terri Gross &amp; Fresh Air - basically I'd like more of that.    \n\n\nAny suggestions?",

Goes deep into understanding the craft of comedy and the development of a particular joke.",

Not on a particular topic, not censoring themselves, not having to make sure they\u2019re being nice. Just chatting about everything and anything. There are so many ones out there with men and I really enjoy them but would absolutely love to listen to women\u2019s ones. Thank you for all and any recommendations!",

One of the things I hate most about it is the fact that they talk about literally absolutely nothing for like the first hour of the show. They just blather on and on about the boring-ass shit in their lives. Then their stupid self-made lowbrow acoustic guitar jingle comes in when the actual content starts and my eyes start to pop out of their sockets as I wonder how easy it would be to simply open the car door and let myself fall out onto the highway like in Lady Bird.\n\nThat all being said, my tastes are obviously not the same as everyone, and you might very much like the intro part of the podcast. Not sure if you're into murder stuff (I'm not) so if you're not you could just skip that part.",

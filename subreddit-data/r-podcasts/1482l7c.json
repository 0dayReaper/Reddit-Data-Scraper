    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m doing pretty decent with my money but I would like to be more knowledgeable. I recently talked to an investment guy at the bank and he honestly confused the shit out of me. I need something that\u2019s in layman\u2019s terms (let\u2019s just pretend I know absolutely nothing at all). \n\nHere\u2019s a list of some things I\u2019m wanting to learn more about: \n1. Managing checking, savings (emergency fund, travel, kids, kids college, you know the million things there are to save for in life).\n2. Investments accounts such as stocks, mutual funds etc. (what they are and how to use them to my advantage) \n3. Retirement accounts and how to beat set these up. \n\nI don\u2019t want big terms I don\u2019t know yet. Just something simple and straightforward for a young, hardworking person.",

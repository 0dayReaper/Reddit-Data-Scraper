    "postText": "There\u2019s a podcast I listened to about 10 years ago about people\u2019s experiences from different backgrounds. The only episode I can remember was about a girl who ran away from home early in life and had an encounter with a trucker serial killer. They would use instrumental music breaks in the episodes. \n\nThe closing line from that particular episode was something like \u201cand I remember being in this car and someone handing me a pack of wine coolers and drinking all of them\u2026 and there was this feeling that was so California and that everything was going to be okay but everything wasn\u2019t okay\u201d. \n\nAny help would be much appreciated!!",

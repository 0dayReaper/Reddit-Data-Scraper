    "postText": "I'm looking for recommendations for podcasts where the host(s) and/or guest(s) just have relatively normal conversations. It's alright if the people are funny, but I'm not looking for podcasts where the point is to make you laugh; it's alright if the people talk about their expertise, but I'm not looking for podcasts where the point is to educate; etc. \n\nFor example, here are a few podcasts I like which I'd consider to be in this category:\n\n+ Everything is fine (Jennifer Romolini &amp; Kim France)\n+ Do by Friday (Alex Cox &amp; Merlin Mann)\n+ Reconcilable Differences (Merlin Mann &amp; John Siracusa)\n+ Tea with Alice (Alice Fraser)",

They share childhood memories, stories about their significant others and just lots of tangents. The structure of the show is they both ask each other a question that they really want to answer with a story themselves. 1 guy grew up in Ireland and the other in Australia.",

So much of it revolved around the \"let's pitch a podcast\" gimmick, and the hosts were constantly trying to create a pantheon of in-jokes.",

I've been listening since about 2010 and they're great. \n\nBlocked Party is also good for this. It's supposed to be about social media but it's really just an excuse to chat about whatever for an hour or so.",

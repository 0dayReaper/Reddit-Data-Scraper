They don't scream randomly because they are scared, they don't drag out the episodes for extra ad time. My only pet peeve with this podcast is that the host, Josh, continually butchers the names of people and places. For example, the host had issues with Lyudmila. He kept saying Lie You'd Mila instead of Lood Mila. That's just a me thing though.",

I can imagine having a famous person as a guest is mutually beneficial. I have a similar question about late night/talk shows\u2026 Anyone have any insight?",

Some shows like that will pay for travel and expenses to come on the show, but that's usually as far as it goes. \n\nWhen you're talking about journalism shows, it's against journalism ethics to pay someone to speak on the record on your show. So your news doesn't get tainted by money. \n\nI have seen some situations where guests demand money, but that really rare and quite strange.",

I *will* say that our reporters were not only excellent but were held to a super high level of ethics. (I almost got my masters in Journalism Ethics!). We were an NPR affiliate run by a large university.\n\nWe could not take people out to lunch/dinner/drinks. \n\nBut for some reason, we could get catered food and drinks. Loopholes, I guess. Bureaucracy as well. SOOOO much of that working for a university.",

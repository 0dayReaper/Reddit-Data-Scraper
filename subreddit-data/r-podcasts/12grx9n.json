Their reactions, sense of humor, and chemistry remind me a LOT of MDWAP, although they are even more comfortable talking about sex and other taboos.\n\nTrixie and Katya have been working together for a long time now so they have great chemistry. Pretty much every reaction video is laugh-out-loud hilarious and extremely raunchy (with the occasionally thoughtful critique from time to time). I particularly recommend their reactions to the more ridiculously sexually charged and raunchy shows/movies, especially the aggressively heteronormative reality dating shows (Bridgerton, and Love is Blind) and Hallmarky romcom Christmas....Basically, the more poorly written the show/movie is, the funnier the reaction is.\n\n[Their recent reaction to Sex/Life season 2 felt the most like MDWAP reacting to Belinda Blinked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEtQb77WiXY&amp;list=PLs9aWCCF6Oy6CnOuLsq3GuDsb-9lZFrEf&amp;index=2) That show is basically porn lol. I love that Netflix really lets Trixie and Katya drag their own shows for filth bc they know their audiences love hate watching their stuff.",

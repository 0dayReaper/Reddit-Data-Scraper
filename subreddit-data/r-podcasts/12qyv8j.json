    "postText": "Recently I was listening to a podcast on Google Podcasts and realized I kept getting ads that were specifically targeted for my location. So that was a clear sign that these were not ads part of the podcast, but inserted ads by Google. \n\nUpon further research it seems Fall 2022 Google gave podcasters the option to switch on Google Ads for additional ad revenue for their podcasts. This sucks especially because there seems to be no way to pay your way out of these. I have Youtube Premium for Ad Free Youtube &amp; Unlimited Music. So its really messed up they are showing these ads to users who already pay Google for ad free!\n\nSo I want to explore what (if any) podcast apps have no external ads without paying a subscription? \n\nIf there are none, then which apps have none with a paid subscription?",

You can read one of the articles about it here\u2026\n\nhttps://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-makes-audio-ads-available-to-all-advertisers/468237/\n\nAlso if you search on any search engine \u201cGoogle Podcasts Ads\u201d then go to the news tab, then you will see multiple articles from last fall discussing this new feature in Google Podcasts. Spotify also does this too, and has for much longer. Especially for their exclusive podcast shows. Plus I have automatic downloads turned off, so I am not downloading them like you were theorizing.\n\nSince you seem a little confused on how external podcast ads are able to know your location, then I will explain it for you. The easiest way to explain how it works is that every phone has an Advertising ID that is unique to only your phone or your account. \n\nThat ID associated with your phone or Google account reports your gender, location, age range, and other details to the Google Analytics Algorithm, then Google plays which ever ad they have in their database that is most relevant to your location or other demographics.\n\nAllowing businesses to choose what area or what group of people to show the ad to allows Google to increase their Ad revenue sales.",

There's no other explanation for why a Vancouver Canada podcast to play an ad for a business based near my home state 2,000+ miles away.\n\nIf you want to see for yourself, then play an episode from \"Spaced Out Radio\" on the Google Podcasts app on your phone. You will see there are ads that just start talking in the middle of their convo without saying they were going to an ad break, like they jormally do in their regular scheduled ad breaks. Maybe you will also might get a location based ad like I did which verified to me these were Google ads.",

The podcast I was listening to does have schedule ad breaks and the host clearly states when they are going to break. However there was at least instances a random ad interrupted without the host saying they were going to an ad break.\n\n2.) The biggest sign it was not from the podcast producer/host was when at least 1 of the ads I got was for a business located right near me, which is over 2,000 moles away from the guy who hosts the podcast in Canada.\n\nBut glad to hear other podcast apps are not doing this. I will check out the 2 you mentioned. Thanks!",

With this technology, you'll get more relevant, up to date, personalized ads even for a podcast published years ago. This has nothing to do with the podcast app. It's all done by the podcast publishers.",

It can also find your identity sort of based on the IP address, if the podcast server tries really hard to connect the dots.\n\nPlease note that the majority of the podcasts are hosted on commercial podcast hosting service providers, such as anchor.com (owned by Spotify). Those podcast hosting service providers have enough data/ways to identify you.\n\nThe key point here is that you are accessing the podcast hosted on a server somewhere.

It just has to be better than what advertisers had before. Before the advent of DAI, podcast ads were almost exclusively for products not available in my country - HelloFresh, HelixMattress and BlueApron. Now, they're all trying to sign me up for college in Scotland or work with Aramco. Neither is *relevant* to me (not interested in going to college, much less to college in Europe - and as a woman, working for the Saudi state isn't exactly appealing), and they would probably know that if they had access to the profile Google or Facebook has on me. But at least they are *available* to me. So the advertisers are *more* likely to get a return on their investments than they were before, and that's a win for them. Hence the proliferation of DAI.",

Some podcasts specifically throw to a \"break\" and that's where they add the signal for your podcast app (platform agnostic - whenever you stream or download the show, from any app, the ad slot will serve you an ad) to serve an ad to you. The podcast hosts have no idea what that ad would be. \n\nThen there are other podcasts, where their midrolls just run in the middle of a sentence. This is not ideal, but it happens. I think that largely depends on the flexibility the podcast has with structuring their show or their podcast host...I'm not sure.",

Technically speaking, yes, the app is taking part in serving the ads, but only in the sense that it is streaming/downloading the episode, which has a marker in the audio to serve a dynamic ad. If you put the same feed into another podcast app, it'll do the same thing, whether we're talking about Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Podcast Addict, etc. etc. Again I haven't read up on Google Podcasts and what they're doing, but Spotify is the only one that I, personally, have heard about inserting their own ads on top of what may be in the show. \n\n/u/Mammoth-Way687 [sent you links to Spreaker's help page](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/12qyv8j/external_ad_free_podcast_apps/jgszjrw/) which explains how it works from the technical sense. DAI is platform-agnostic. \n\nAlso, sometimes you may *not* get an ad at all, depending on various circumstances. \n\nI can't give you specifics but I work in a media company and am just getting started on the side of scheduling audio ads onto radio streams and podcasts; we can check for avails (i.e. number of impressions that we can serve) and our avails have listings for pre-roll, midroll, and post-roll. These ads are served regardless of what platform you're using to listen. \n\nI'm not going to tell you you're wrong about Google Podcasts specifically serving ads not contained within the podcast feed, but from everything you're writing in this post, it really sounds to me like you're talking about dynamic ads. These are really popular for various reasons (as you point out, someone can serve a local and relevant ad to you instead of a host reading about the benefit of buying Casper mattresses), so you're going to find them in a lot of places - most especially bigger podcast networks.",

            "comment": "Folks have already explained DAI to you, so I'll skip that. Here is how you can verify if the ads were inserted by your app or by the publisher\n\n* Every podcast is backed by a RSS feed - this is how the podcatchers know what episodes are there in a podcast, and where the audio files can be found\n* So, your first step would be to find the RSS feed for the podcast. [Here's Spaced Out Radio's feed](https://www.spreaker.com/show/1657874/episodes/feed) - you can find it by going to the [hosting page for this podcast](https://www.spreaker.com/show/spaced-out-radio-show), and clicking on the RSS icon (looks like `.))` if you squint, lol)\n* You should be able to view the plain text RSS document on any browser - scroll through and find the episode you're interested in\n* The episode will have an associated MP3 file - [here's an example from Spaced Out Radio](https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/53577785/april_18_23_sasquatch_science_with_dr_melba_ketchum.mp3)\n* Download the MP3 and play in browser/music player/however you prefer to play MP3s\n\nCongratulations - you have just bypassed your podcast app all together and gone directly to the source. If you still hear the targeted ad, changing your podcast app is not gonna help - the downloaded file comes with the ads, and there's nothing any app can do. [For the record, the hosting service used by this podcast *does* [offer dynamic ad insertion](https://help.spreaker.com/en/articles/4118800-how-to-activate-the-ads-on-your-podcast)]\n\nIf you *don't* hear the targeted ad, then try out any of the other suggestions in this thread. Podcast Republic is my preferred choice.",

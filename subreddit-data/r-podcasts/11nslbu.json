    "postText": "I'm wondering if anyone else is feeling this--to be honest, I feel weirdly guilty about not enjoying the pod as much as I once did. I really enjoy Michael and Aubrey and their chemistry. I've always liked the You're Wrong About Extended Universe projects. And I like that Aubrey is so open to sharing experiences that must be harrowing and hard to talk about.\n\nConversely, I feel like the show's bias has become a distraction for me. I do not believe it is my business to judge or concern-troll anybody's body. As a lifelong anorexic, I know what it feels like to have people call you disgusting and publicly ridicule your body. However, Aubrey often points out that this kind of bullying is not particularly valid, as thin people enjoy so much privilege. Fair enough. But the pain of constantly obsessing over my size and the very real fear that people will harass me about it is real for me. I've been chased around and held down while people shove chips into my mouth. I've been told no man will ever desire my body. I've been shouted at randomly to \"eat something or I'll blow away.\" I've been laughed at a lot.  As much as I understand her point, I can't help but feel a little dismissed and even made fun of by the show's jokes about thin people expressing any experience of ridicule. \n\nStill, I know that is personal and largely informed by my own timid defensiveness. In no way do I mean to invalidate the point that fat people suffer far greater systemic bigotry. It does dovetail with my bigger concern about the show: that fat voices are given much more consideration and nuanced understanding than others. Recently, Aubrey quoted and lauded a HAES influencer who (to my understanding) makes money just like fitness influencers--using the same tactics, and suffering the same accusations of grifting behavior and espousing unsupported fitness claims. I can't help but feel the level of scrutiny is not consistent here. And it's not the first time I have perceived uneven standards for whose points are considered valid and useful on the pod, and whose are written off wholesale.\n\nThere is so much I love about Maintenance Phase. Tackling the American Wellness machine and questioning whether our biases against fat people are actually rooted in science or just learned discrimination is an important discussion. The messages we pass on to our children about size matter so much, and I love that Aubrey and Michael are so outspoken about it. Even more vital: the affirmation that all people deserve care, consideration, and common decency. However, I think those points survive without some of the uneven claims and scrutiny sometimes aired on the pod.\n\nThe claims that there is no evidence AT ALL that some health issues may be related to weight is tough for me. They do openly admit that there are health problems directly related to being underweight. But Aubrey will not even entertain the idea that this extends to people who are fat. (I hope saying \"fat\" is not offensive. Aubrey definitely prefers it and I really enjoy her perspective on language.) I emphatically agree that doctors should not dismiss health concerns on the assumption it is all a matter of weight. I know from friends and family that they are very often dismissed when they seek healthcare. They deserve to be heard.\n\nStill, The National Institute of Health, The CDC, The AMA, and The WHO, among countless others, do recognize obesity as a risk to overall health and classify it as a disease. There are certainly studies that question the extent to which obesity is as worrisome as once thought, and suggest it is a risk factor, but absolutely not the only one we should consider. I am glad that Aubrey and Michael are working to re-examine the so-called Obesity Epidemic. But I think their points would be even stronger if they did admit the vast consensus, and not place overly-weighted confidence in the studies or editorials that question that consensus. I think both are valid, and a less biased discussion would yield a stronger argument. Because in the end, to my mind they are right and just in their overall message, and I'd like to see them succeed in every way.\n\nI'm curious if I am alone in feeling this. I sincerely hope I haven't offended anyone or unfairly represented the hosts, and I suspect maybe this is more in my head than anything else. But I'd be really curious to see your opinions. Thanks for listening!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold, and more than that, for such a thoughtful, personal, and respectful response. I wish I could reply to everyone all day, because your words are all really sincere and meaningful to me. I\u2019ll continue to read them all. But, to everyone struggling with their body image, you\u2019re so worthy of being heard and being understood. Thank you for making me feel far less alone \u2764\ufe0f",

I stumbled upon this podcast when I typed in \u2018maintenance phase\u2019 \u2014 because I\u2019d lost weight and reached my goal and wanted to maintain it, thought there might be a nice podcast that would provide tips and motivation. Instead, I find a very catty duo that almost seems to want to deny me the results of my efforts. I do agree with their comments about the Wellness Machine. I agree that much of it is a money-making racket/scam. But, I was able to lose weight with no tricks, cut back calories and spent more time on the exercises I truely love doing. I agree with some of what she says but n other ways she is in denial about the health implications of obesity. She says you shouldn\u2019t try to lose weight because you\u2019ll just gain it back anyway. Most do gain it back. But 20% of people keep it off and the National Weight Loss Registry tracks what people do to keep the weight off \u2014 nothing fancy but you can learn from them. \nFor those that have disordered eating and dysmorphia, I wonder if there is a nice empathetic podcast that acknowledges your challenges and gently guides you along.",

So i guess you can listen to him as  entertainment. But people need to realize that he is not a credible source of fact-based information. Or you at least have to critically reflect on his statements.\n\n\u0130f you want to analyze it from a communicative perspective. His podcast is very much an in-group medium for a left-of center-media bubble - and in these, the motivation for communication is skewed towards maintaining in-group-status by aligning with pre-existing believes and less so to convey factual information that then may clash with those believes and therefore may harm the in-group-status. \n\n\u0130 think it's a healthy way of consuming media to critically reflect on these kind of group dynamics.",

            "comment": "The hosts bring up some very important facts about anti-fat bias and how the medical industry can be so harmful to bigger people, and how terribly fat people are treated in our society. But there are also many instances of the hosts exhibiting confirmation bias, cherry picking, etc. when it comes to some of the studies they attempt to debunk. \n\nTheir personal biases are not surprising to me, especially considering that Aubrey is a fat liberation activist. I think in many ways her activist lense translates to passion for the topic, which is understandable. However, the hosts often lack nuance when confronted with evidence that weight can be a risk factor for certain illnesses. \n\nI think this podcast should be taken with a grain of salt, and definitely not as medical advice, and listening to this show is a reminder for me as to why yelling at people to \u201cdo your own research\u201d can be so counterproductive. We all have biases and if you do not know how to differentiate a good scientific study from a bad one (like most people), you\u2019re going to look for information that confirms your biases and downplay information that contradicts it.\n\nTwo things can be true at the same time. 1) Fat people deserve to be treated with dignity and not every person\u2019s life will improve just by losing weight. Obsessing over a number on the scale can be very detrimental to your self-image and overall health. 2) And at the same time, we should respect one another\u2019s bodily autonomy and ability to determine for ourselves how we want to show up in this world; for people like myself who come from a long line of folks who have really suffered from chronic diseases like diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, etc., focusing on prevention through weight management and other lifestyle changes is not in and of itself fatphobic, and these changes (when done in a sustainable way) can have benefits for our overall health that go way beyond just weight loss. \n\n(Anecdotally, last year I was hesitant to start working out and eating better after I found out I had high cholesterol, because I thought doing those things would make me fatphobic. A friend had to talk some sense into me because I had gotten so caught up in the anti-diet culture echo chamber that I was prioritizing the opinions of people I did not know on the internet over my own better judgment and suggestion from a trusted medical doctor).",

Social media often has a way of reducing complex issues to sound bites and slogans for the purpose of \u201craising awareness\u201d without requiring further critical thinking and reflection, and this happens across the political spectrum.

The good of the show comes with the bad and I certainly don\u2019t begrudge people who don\u2019t enjoy it since I don\u2019t always enjoy it either.\n\nIt is a frustrating show to be a fan of sometimes and I can emphasize with a lot of what you wrote.\nI do think you may be reading in a bit much when Aubrey talks about people with eating disorders, it doesn\u2019t seem like she is specifically calling \u201cthin\u201d people with eating disorders less valid than fat ones. More like she\u2019s trying to make space to acknowledge fat people with eating disorders are often minimized or even left out of those conversations.\n\nI could be entirely off base about that however since it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve listened to episodes touching on those topics, so if I\u2019m wrong please let me know!",

I understand that discussions of weight cover a wide spectrum of overweight, but Aubrey seems to over-apply her understanding of her version of the fat experience to everyone else's. Yes, it would take intense self-discipline (and genetics) for someone of her size to lose the weight. But is she seriously going to argue that losing 30-80 pounds is some impossible goal for most people? Then in the next breath she disparages calorie-tracking as eating disorder behavior. Like, no shit you're going to fail if you refuse to use the main tool of weight loss. \n\nFrankly, I find both of Hobbes' podcasts to be increasingly insulated from reality, made more infuriating because he often proclaims his impartiality and use of research. You can basically predict exactly what he's going to say if you've ever listened to any liberal \"hot take\" podcast ever, just with more citations (useless because this is a podcast so is anyone actually going to call *him* out on it?). \n\nI think his perspective worked better on You're Wrong About because the other host was warm and she tempered him. Instead of arguing for a one-sided perspective, they were working to reconsider and rehabilitate the view of maligned cultural figures. They didn't paint Tonya Harding as innocent (although maybe they believe it), but they did humanize her. None of that subtlety is in Maintenance Phase or If Books Could Kill, which feel like the typical NYT circlerjerk.",

They are not really effectuating outreach to the undecided with their rhetoric and I personally happen to disagree with them on a few issues myself, even as someone who is progressive. However, the effect I\u2019m talking about is that by having people vocal about the most extreme ideas, other ideas just under that level seem tolerable and acceptable in comparison. It\u2019s the same reason why someone who is center-right wing seems great in comparison to Donald Trump. People on the left wouldn\u2019t have said anything positive about someone like a Liz Cheney, but Trump went so far off the rails complaining the election is stolen that she seems good.",

It\u2019s one of the few things I happen to know a lot about. \n\nI compartmentalize all information I absorb. I have grown as a person from listening to Aubrey talk about the social aspects of weight. I enjoy the heck out of the wellness influencers episodes. I am enjoying the diet book ones less \u2014 they did Why French Women Don\u2019t Get Fat dirty. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t realize until I started to respond to you that MP has had zero impact on my own struggles with weight. I know what I need to do and I just have a compliance problem. In MP world I\u2019m living a lie. And having lived life all over the scale, life is better when I\u2019m smaller and stronger and not just because of how I look. My health issues are helped immensely. I\u2019m in my mid-fifties. And I\u2019m just being honest, I won\u2019t trust Aubrey\u2019s self-reporting on any health problems as she gets older. \n\nYou will have to pry out of my cold dead hands the idea that one has to be hyper-vigilant in an obesogenic environment to not gain weight. I won\u2019t let anyone try and tell me that is disordered thinking, it\u2019s just not. And I do not take it personally \u2014 a lot of my personal journey has been in reading books about how it\u2019s not my fault I can\u2019t eat all the food around me. But I still can\u2019t eat the food. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry to hear you experienced such horrible treatment. The level of scrutiny is not consistent and it\u2019s also a little hypocritical of Aubrey to expect people to imagine themselves in her shoes while apparently not reading any memoirs of the experiences of anorexics or bulimics. Or maybe she has and is just not interested in folding it into her agenda. That is her right, but when they do their occasional catty asides implying that life is easier for thin women in my head I think oh come on, you\u2019re doing the exact same thing \u2014 see how easy it is to be snarky about bodies? How easy it is to reduce problems to size? Aubrey has made me have some come to Jesus moments about my own behavior while apparently finding hers above reproach. \n\nThey both can be immature, but I have learned a lot from them and I just take what I want and leave the rest behind.",

Unless you get really lucky, the SAD is going to impact you at some point in your life. And there is no one way to battle our disordered environment.\n\nMP seems to debunk from a place of \"this is not the answer.\" Of course one thing is seldom THE answer for just about everyone and everything. And in fairness to them, that is some of the messaging we get as well, that there are simple answers to losing weight.\n\nThe human body does not adhere cleanly to the law of thermodynamics. Calories are a very inexact science. But that doesn't mean that calories can't be a tool in someone's arsenal to get a handle on their weight and health. For some people calorie counting alone works great. I know people who lost a lot of weight and keep it off by calorie counting. You can't deny their experience and they've not lost their minds, they're better off for having found something that works for them.\n\nI can't calorie count, but I will admit that keto, which does work for me, might work purely because it's the only way I can eat fewer calories long enough to see a difference. For other people keto is as much a source of misery as calorie counting and hunger are for me.",

People treat meals as sacred, they don't rush through them, they don't eat on the go. The subtle difference of making food about connection to others, a time to talk and eat slowly, rather than scarf something down in the car matters. Also French people cook at a home, a huge difference again between the USA and other countries.  I just think so much was missed in that episode about how cultures can have different attitudes and relationships with food that result in different generic outcomes in each society.",

And I appreciate that you've written out a lengthy post detailing your thoughts; too often people just say \"I don't like this anymore\". \n\nI definitely agree with you, the distinct bias toward any sort of sustainable weight loss is very evident once you notice it. Their most recent episode about \"what we're telling kids\" was a great tear down of what the American Academy of Pediatrics, but there were little things sprinkled in there about sustainable weight loss that stick out like a sore thumb. They don't belong in that conversation, for one. Two, sustainable weight loss is possible, and YES, it is true that many people who \"go on a diet\" lose weight initially and put it back on. But that's because they do not undertake a full lifestyle change and go back to their eating habits. Check out /r/loseit and you'll find plenty of people who are able to lose weight and maintain their new body. And there was another comment from Aubrey (it might have been echoed by Michael, not sure) about \"your body just wants to be fat\" - I paraphrase but that's such a silly notion. \n\nI agree that it's best not to encourage children and teenagers to engage in weight loss, but the idea that bodies are either naturally thin or naturally fat doesn't compute with me. Yes, yes, there are certain genetic factors that affect things but it is theoretically possible for anyone to get fit (I hesitate to say \"thin\" because there definitely are negative connotations with that term). Bottom line for me: there is a difference between saying \"it's okay to be fat\" and \"you can be okay with your body\", which is how Fat Activists have twisted the Healthy at Every Size movement. \n\nI don't think I fully responded to your post, so I will say that I agree with your opinions. I don't think you are unfairly representing the hosts; they definitely have a strong opinion about weight and weight loss, and in my opinion they view everything they talk about through a lens of bias against fat people and that sustainable weight loss doesn't work, so a lot of their takedowns are very one-sided. \n\nI pick and choose what I listen to at the moment, and I try my best not to get ticked off when they say certain things. But it is difficult, for sure.",

Weight and body composition is a matter of complex biology, which is still not entirely understood, and SOME people are genetically predisposed. This is not an excuse. This is not propoganda.

Younger people have faster metabolisms. Even eating more can increase metabolism to an extent because of homeostasis. \n\nLiterally no one is saying all thin people have above average metabolisms. But it is one factor for some people. It is one explanation for size diversity. So many bodies are different. Most bodies will fit in the normal distribution of the bell curve and behave as expect when it comes to input and output if calories. But other bodies will be outliers and have different things going on. Multiple things can be true at once.",

                    "comment": "This was my comment from three weeks ago after I fell off with YWA (it was on a post about dropping podcasts for trivial reasons, but I still stand by them):\n\n&gt;I realize this post is four months old as of this comment, but it is the most recent on the topic, it is not yet locked, and I need to rant.\n\n&gt;Yesterday I left a media criticism/debunking podcast I loved because the hosts claimed OJ Simpson wasn't really ever that popular, and therefore the media coverage of the scandal surrounding him in 1994-1995 was overblown from the jump.\n\n&gt;The hosts were actually alive when the event happened, but they were six- and 12-years-old at the time and just not that into him, so apparently they assumed they were justified making this declaration as if it was fact. \n\n&gt;For the record: I was not *that* much older than they were and was never that into him either. But I can remember things too, and of all of the sensationalized tabloid scandals from the 1990s, a major former athlete/current sports broadcaster/TV and film actor/B-list celebrity and famous \"good guy\" personality savagely murdering his ex-wife and her friend and getting away with it because police brutality is actually a legitimately bigger f'ing deal . . . was actually a big f'ing deal.\n\n&gt;I binged 50+ episodes over the past two weeks of this podcast after the hosts initially impressed me with what seemed like a solid dedication to research. I liked their personalities, I was curious about the topics of their episodes, and I am genuinely interested in media criticism and correcting my own misconceptions.\n\n&gt;One of the first episodes I listened to was about Jonestown, a subject I'd researched a small bit myself over the years, and it featured an interview with a journalist who had presumably investigated it much more than I had. Yet said journalist didn't even address the biggest controversy to arise from the original depiction of events in the media: that some Jonestown victims may not have died by their own hand. Even if that point was debatable, didn't it bear mentioning given the entire premise of the podcast? Then again, I'm not a journalist. What do I know?\n\n&gt;There were more issues like this - instances when no new information was gleaned, no new contradictions to the old narrative were revealed, no real critique of a past flawed perspective was discussed - and with an added contempt as time progressed for sources who may have contributed further input but whose lived experiences were disregarded by the hosts as anecdotal and whose views were dismissed as \"retconned\".\n\n&gt;It all became an oversimplified exercise in giving the formally \"maligned\" a sympathetic re-edit. Which is fine [if they deserve it, I might add]. I could have done without the audience-shaming insinuations that this was novel and the presumption that the rest of us were unenlightened because we were expecting the deeper take for which the hosts previously proved themselves capable, but sure. Empathy is good.\n\n&gt;Then I got to the OJ episodes, and the endless book report of a horribly sentimental memoir from a relatively minor character whose Mary Sue reflection of herself and overly-romanticized depiction of her relationship with Simpson never inspired a hint of doubt from these hosts or even the most obvious of critical questions: Who was this poor woman's ghostwriter, and why would they do her this way?\n\n&gt;Thus bringing us to the aforementioned moment as the two pondered whether Simpson was ever *really* that important, and wouldn't people have rather finished watching their basketball game?\n\n&gt;I mean, what is life anyway?\n\n&gt;^(End rant. Thank you for your time. You can now resume regular programming already in progress.)",

I'm heavier than I wish to be, so I started to work at losing weight, especially when I realized that it was making me physically uncomfortable.

I think there\u2019s often a blurring of the line between being slightly overweight and the severe levels of distress caused by eating disorders.  \n\nI\u2019ve had periods of bulimia that were very much related to trauma and there\u2019s nothing empowering about binge eating when it\u2019s distressing and out of control.  They way they just simply won\u2019t acknowledge that binge eating/BED behaviors exist at all and might very well be a result of trauma and causing great distress to the individual is really frustrating and overly simplistic. \n\nIt also does a disservice to a lot of the really good work regarding weight bias and fatphobia by presenting all of those narratives in an overly simplistic and reductionist way.",

I then proceeded to hardcore binge the back catalogue for the next two weeks (and of course check out the *You're Wrong About* Extended Universe because apparently I'm a Michael Hobbes stan).\n\nOver that time it became *abundantly* clear that Aubrey had a specific, I dunno, ulterior motive sounds too sneaky and what she's doing is pretty in your face. Maybe a good way to say it is that her opinions are calcified and she isn't really influenced/interested in anything that conflicts with those opinions.\n\nI  think I remember her saying she considers herself a \"fat activist\" or maybe a \"fat rights activist\" which clearly comes through with a lot of what she says. And in this light it's kinda clear she's taking the \"activist stance\" more than the \"totally open to science let's figure out the facts\" stance, which is obviously where Michael's coming from. Bottom line is she wants to get society to the point where fat people aren't judged negatively, and I think in that noble pursuit, she strays too far into fanatical thinking territory. \n\nI  personally think Aubrey would acknowledge your specific issue because she talks a lot about \"disordered eating\" which doesn't only pertain to fat people. Her thing seems to be that she **really** wants fat people to be included in that side of the discussion, and not \"eww gross a fat person.\"\n\nTo that end but without going into a ton of detail, this pod helped me realize that I have a mild eating disorder, which surprised the hell out of me being a burly dude in his forties (for some reason it never occurred to me that I could have an issue with food since I'm not really that \"into\" food). I just want to say I'm super grateful to have this knowledge now.\n\nHonestly what keeps me listening is Michael. I really appreciate his buffering of Aubrey and the research he does and how he presents it. And if you listen carefully, you can hear him rebut her fairly often, but always *very* gently.\n\nSo yeah, I think there's a fair bit of good info in the pod, and I'm one million percent behind people feeling good about themselves, but you've absolutely got to take Aubrey's opinions with a grain of salt.",

But just to add to the thoughts here, basically this podcast has started to make it sound like you aren\u2019t allowed to feel how you feel or do what you want to do with your OWN BODY. Like it\u2019s okay for someone to be fat and want to be fat (not using that as a derogatory term but as the hosts use it) but it isn\u2019t okay to feel bad in your obese body and want to lose weight. They claim this is always society forcing your hand. \n\nIn my opinion this could go both ways or this could go neither way. All fat people don\u2019t want to stay fat because it\u2019s their intentional choice to say F U to society, all thin people aren\u2019t staying thin because they feel they have to, and the reality is a heck of a lot of people are somewhere in the middle and we may change our minds several times in a lifetime on how we view our bodies and their respective weights. \n\nThe blatant disregard for nuance, genetics, mental health, scientific research, and empathy is why this podcast is turning me off when I truly used to enjoy it. Their original intention was good, their message to stop treating fat people like lower class citizens is good, but their insistence that every single person must view weight the way they do or they\u2019ve been tricked/manipulated/brainwashed into thinking that way is ignorant.",

I've listened to every episode and then MP came along and I was on it. \n\nThe MP subreddit sees Aubrey's word as the all mighty message. And I find that so troublesome. She has her perspective, as a 350lb woman and you have yours and I have mine. I listen to her, and I've read both of her books. I value her perspective, but it's just another perspective. And her books overlap a lot with the podcast and with each other. \n\nYour experiences are valid. She talks about thin and straight skinny people as not as oppressed as fat people and I don't think it should be a pissing contest. Don't comment on people's bodies. Try to make good food choices that provide you with nutrients. Move your body everyday for the joy of moving. End there. \n\nAnd I agree, we don't see a lot of 400lb people in their 80's. There's likely a reason for that that has to do with weight and lifestyle. I can be body positive and want a long and active life for myself. What Aubrey has taught me is more about my personal biases, even when not outwardly expressed, when I view fat people in public. And I'm thankful for that insight.\n\nEdit: I am a fat person. Aubrey would categorize me as \"straight\" sized. I've recently lost 70 lbs and I don't want to be one of those people that now holds a superiority complex over people that are larger than me. That is what Aubrey has made me consciously consider.",

Saying that there's is absolutely no correlation or evidence that obesity leads so health problems is such an outrageously false claim. two things can be true at the same time \u2013 fat people deserve to be treated with as much respect as everyone else, not every health problem is linked to obesity and, at the same time, obesity does cause a lot of physical complications! from joint problems, to cardiovascular diseases, to diabetes, and negating this correlation is truly a disservice to fat people. I also think it's ridiculous to claim that permanent weight loss is impossible, when so many people manage to make lasting changes to their lifestyle, start eating healthy, work out and lose weight as a result. this is a good thing and sometimes I feel like Aubrey makes it seem like weight loss is inherently disordered, which just isn't the case. losing weight and keeping it off is definitely possible and saying it isn't is so discouraging for people who want to lose weight in order to improve their quality of life. I get especially mad when they talk about obesity in children, which is a huge problem and definitely something that should be tackled, instead they belittle possible health complications and brush it off like it's no big deal. I found it so grating I completely stopped listening, I used to love the show but the pod is no longer tackling diet culture and the wellness industry, but instead promoting false claims and negating scientific studies",

So it's sad, to me, that this podcast is SO popular and so many people seem to take what they say as gospel. I've seen writeups from other redditors where they point out the evidence/studies they use in the show are often cherry picked, completely twisted, or they'll favor old data that supports their opinion over newer data that would contradict or steer away from that. Of course I have no links now nor could I explain it myself so, meh. \n\nBasically anyone who puts a basic concept like CICO on the same level as a silly fad diet, is not a trustworthy person or someone to listen to about ANYthing. \n\nSo yeah, never made it through an entire episode, so my opinion is obv worth less than someone who has.

What they point out is that this is taken as scientific fact by almost the entire world but actually the data on it is incredibly difficult to use to scientifically support such a hypothesis because of all the confounding variables in the data.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t denying health issues exist, this is pointing out that bad science is being relied upon for a huge amount of action when actually better research would probably help fat people who need it better.\n\nI understand you feel sensitive about the skinny people talk but I think it\u2019s a bad faith reading to think they\u2019re referring to people who are anorexic rather than your more average thin person who isn\u2019t even necessarily super thin but like Michael just has a middling BMI.\n\nEdited to add, but obviously you don\u2019t need to listen to anything you don\u2019t want to!",

They have no place calling the science \"bad\" and they are frequently totally wrong about what the science actually says (and that's a charitable interpretation because I actually mostly think they deliberately misrepresent things and cherry-pick). Having a podcast predicated on \"debunking\" science hosted by two non-scientists who have no idea what they are talking about is just absurd and it does a disservice to the cause they are trying to support.",

There is quite a lot about it that I find good, but the cherry-picking of data or which studies pass muster has made me a bit wary lately. I love both of their voices and still want to read some of Aubrey\u2019s books. \n\nI\u2019ve found myself going towards \u201cBurnt Toast\u201d by Virginia Sole-Smith much more lately for my destroying diet culture listening. I really love the host and her way of getting to the emotional heart of things. \n\nSo much of my concern with diet culture is in breaking down messages I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019d internalized and doing better toward those around me and especially for young people. Her podcast really helps me love and accept my slightly fat body and also makes me more aware of how I talk about food and bodies around others and around my kid and my nieces and nephews. \n\nOddly enough, I\u2019ve been really enjoying the pod 5-4 with the dude from if books could kill. But the rest of the YWA universe has lost some of its shine for me too. I do kind of hope Aubrey and Michael veer back towards the diet books take downs and terrible diet drugs and fads. I really enjoyed the stuff about the food pyramid they did.",

Whatever value it has as substantive critique is outweighed by a fairly robust resistance to anything that challenges the hosts' narrative.

Once you get \"don't hate yourself for being fat and think about your health\" it's the opposite of helpful health advice.",

They talk about health and wellness and site all these sources but fail to acknowledge that while being fat can be fine for some people it can be a huge problem for some. Basically just because it isn't a problem for Aubreys health the show will often act as if it isnt for anyone.\n\n\nI also feel the show really pits people against health proffesionals even if they don't mean to which can be such a dangerous pipeline! They are conveying to people that if they are over weight their doctor will belittle them and lie to them and then don't offer any solutions or help for the issue. Just throw people into a panic and then offer no solutions when the solutions are just as easy to research as the problems. Something like \"hey if you're doctor is focusing on your weight and you need X looked at you can \"today my main concern is about ______\" or something helpful other than if you over weight everyone and everything is out to get you and its us against the world!",

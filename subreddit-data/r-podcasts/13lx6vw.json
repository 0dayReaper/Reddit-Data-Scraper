    "postText": "I just received word that New York Times is phasing out Audm in June, to be replaced with the iOS-only NYTimes audio app. This is really unfortunate -- Audm was a really unique app with high-quality content.\n\nSo, are there any good alternatives for Android listeners, or those that want a broader array of content than what's found on the NYTimes site? I'm specifically referring to apps that have longform or in-depth articles read by actual people (not TTS).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For those asking, Audm is not just a podcast player. It's an app that has curated articles from across dozens of publications, with professional voice actors reading them outload. It's basically like Audible, but for articles.",

It's a great way to be able to get big stories from lots of v good publications without paying for half a dozen subscriptions. I guess if the NYT were always planning to drop it as a standalone product, they never tried to build the user base.\n\nThe NYT have said the new app will have a 'newstand' feature that will have journalism from other publications. But idk if all those competing publications will happily let the NYT publish their content on the NYT app. So I expect the breadth of publications available (the main selling point of Audm for me) will reduce.",

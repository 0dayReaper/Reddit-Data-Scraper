    "postText": "I'm trying to find a podcast that gives a detailed overview of the US Civil Rights movement as a whole. I don't want podcasts about specific individuals or stories. I feel like I was only ever taught about the civil rights movement in discrete fragments, e.g. \"this is what Rosa Parks did,\" \"this was what the freedom riders did.\" I'm looking for a podcast that examines the \"big picture\" so I can get a better understanding of the general movement and timeline. The longer/more episodes the better.",

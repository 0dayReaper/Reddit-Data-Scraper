It makes the whole experience a lot more pleasurable. \n\nSorry for not answering your question as I have no alternative but I just wanted to comment cause I know how you feel.",

It's not a fools review show like Redbar but they are all messy bitches who live for podcast drama and brutal roasting of each other.",

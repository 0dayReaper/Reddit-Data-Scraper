Are there any similar pods out there that deal with marriage and money? Thanks!",

            "comment": "You could poke around episode descriptions of This Is Uncomfortable for episodes dealing with merging finances.\n\nBut IMO basically any podcast that deals with personal stories about financial management is going to have some component devoted to how choices impact partnerships, since so many people are in partnerships.\n\nFinancial Confessions is one I listen to pretty frequently.\n\n\u2018Til Debt Do Us Part is a series that can be listened to on YouTube as though it were a podcast. It\u2019s getting pretty old but the feedback is pretty timeless.\n\nEdit: this is uncomfortable recommendation beat by six minutes :P",

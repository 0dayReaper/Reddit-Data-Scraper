Devils tower?)",

I think there was another episode that had to do with a group of climbers getting stuck or something along those lines. \nIt has been seriously killing me trying to think of the name or where I heard it.",

Thanks so much I think this is the one, and I bet the reason I couldn\u2019t find it is I use apple predominately and only Amazon for their exclusives, and never thought to look there! I\u2019m so thrilled, thank you so much for the help! Honestly means so much!",

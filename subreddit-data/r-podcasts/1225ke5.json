I would also not prefer political or business podcasts, as I do not enjoy those. Mental health podcasts are preferred. I will also accept audiobooks.\n\nExamples of what I've been listening to:\n\n* Struggle Care\n* CWC Talks\n* The Magnus Archives\n* Welcome to Nightvale",

They are detailed, objective, and he says when information just isn't conclusive. He is a playwright by trade so the entire tale of each episode has a lovely cadence, flow, and resolution.\n\nOne episode (or a series of them) talks about how Darwin had already penned his theory of evolution before humans understood how reproduction actually functions. He then details all the misguided theories that existed before sperm, egg, and inherited DNA solidified as the answer. \n\nIt is not for everyone but I fuckin love it - dispite having zero passion for history.\n\n\"Because of...say it with me... fucking Aristotle.\"",

Some can get sad like their barbed wire episode most are funny because they have guests they explain the subject to them.\n\nStuff you should know-the podcast and the network is pretty awesome for content that is pretty ever green\n\nIf you like more radio drama type content try checking out audible, they generally have free content for subscribers like audiobooks and audio plays. For non audible dependable content I have been enjoying the audiobooks from ilona andrews. They hit that perfect balance for strong competent heroines, romance, and an adventure. Just be advised their first book in the Kate Daniels can get a but clunky but still pretty awesome. Their innkeeper series has even been adapted by graphic audio as audio plays. It is about an innkeeper who hosts some very special guests. \n\nIf you have a public library card, try checking out the libby app, it is a great resource for books, audiobooks, magazines, etc.",

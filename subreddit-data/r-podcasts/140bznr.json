    "postText": "I know it is a strange request, but I would like to know if there are podcasts with background chats/noises, like the one you hear in old radio or old TV shows or maybe home chats/sounds. \n\nI'm not a native English speaker but I would prefer it in English. I don't know why but since I was child I was very attracted to that kind of sounds/noise/voices because they made me imagine a cozy home envoirment. \n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

            "comment": "I can think of a few audio drama podcasts that use them from time to time to make scenes feel more alive. But I don\u2019t know if there are any that are just background noise. \n\nWhat are you looking for exactly? Like if you want *just* the background noise, I bet you can find a white noise generator with cafe sounds or a YouTube track that is background noise plus music. But if you\u2019re looking for a podcast specifically with that noise behind it, that\u2019s going to be tricky.",

I was looking for something like the random chats you hear on radio stations in Vampire Bloodlines as example or like I wrote in the other comment the TV in The Sims. Something random that can convey the surprise or mystery of the old Windows screensaver \"Mystery\" (the one with the house during night).\n\nThank you for the answer!",

They may not have exactly what you want but maybe it's a good place to start? \n\nAlso, they're not free but the [Zen Broadcasting System](https://www.zbs.org/index_new.php) has a lot of audio adventures and they love using ambient sounds like that. I think they have some samples on their site, that might give you a sense of what they're like.",

I don't think I'll make my own, I'm looking for them to have a surprise, a sense of discovery after hearing something that might be normal or not (like those chats and commercials in videogames) Anyway I'll check them right now, thank you again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

    "postText": "Just an interesting (disturbingly fascinating story) episode of a decent podcast. While interviewing extreme sports type people, they also interview other general celebrities, and I think Tony Hawk and Jason Ellis compliment each other well; Tony kind of more reserved and respectful, and Ellis more the wild card humor guy. Thhey have a good, comfortable flow together that doesn't feel forced or awkward (though sometimes awkward podcasts can be great comedic value). \n\nEpisode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSxXLSMCIdc\n\nThe channel: https://www.youtube.com/@HawkvsWolf",

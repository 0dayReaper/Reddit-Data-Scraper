It\u2019s broadcast on Radio 4 in the comedy spot\u2026. Which as weird as it sounds is \u2018prime time\u2019 on the premier speech radio channel). It\u2019s presented by public historian Greg Jenner, a guest comedian ( usually someone who is culturally appropriate for the subject) and an academic expert in the chosen era/person.\n\nIt\u2019s really good. Very entertaining and the format really works. Greg has become one of my favourite broadcasters.",

It's not comedy on the level of You're Dead To Me, but there is a lot of fun and banter (depending on topic some episodes are obviously more serious)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf-arsed history is also generally on the funnier side (again, with exceptions for more serious topics). Again there are a bit more episodes about British, European and Australian topics, but there are episodes about topics from all over the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want a bit more focus on the comedy aspect, I'd recommend Do Go On: hosted by three comedians, with one of them preparing a topic each episode, while the others basically derail the presentation with banter and tangential stories. Unlike the other podcasts, there are no historians involved here, but the episodes are generally well researched, think of it as a kind of wikipedia deep dive with funny commentary. Not all episodes are about history and there's quite a few epsiodes about Australia, Britain and the USA, but again topics from all over the world are represented.",

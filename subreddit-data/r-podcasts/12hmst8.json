    "postText": "Hi r/podcasts! We\u2019re [Jason Moon](https://twitter.com/jasonmoonNHPR) (Bear Brook\u2019s award-winning reporter/host) and [Rebecca Lavoie](https://twitter.com/reblavoie) (podcast director at [New Hampshire Public Radio](https://www.nhpr.org/)), and we\u2019re here to answer your questions about the [Bear Brook](https://link.chtbl.com/7vVauHuF?sid=ama) podcast, Jason\u2019s investigation, the state of true crime, and more.\n\n**We\u2019ll be answering your questions today from 12pm (noon) ET to 1pm ET. Ask us anything!**\n\nA little about Bear Brook: It\u2019s been nearly five years since the series debut of Bear Brook, which has garnered more than 24 million downloads. Season 1, about the case that [changed how murders are investigated](https://www.bearbrookpodcast.com/season-one), led to the identification of multiple victims. Earlier this year, the team came back with Bear Brook Season 2: A True Crime Story to explore an even more complex case that many believe involved a wrongful conviction. \n\nThe new season centers on the 1988 murder of Sharon Johnson that resulted in a conviction for 19-year-old Jason Carroll. The only evidence? His own taped confession, which he claims was the result of coercion by a veteran detective \u2013 and his mother. More than 30 years later, is it possible to get to the truth and who gets to tell it?\n\nThroughout this new season (all 8 episodes are available now), we interviewed the people who continue to be profoundly affected by this case and explore what happens when the official narrative is challenged by lawyers \u2013 and podcasters \u2013 as well as the critical impact \"true crime stories\" can have on real cases. If you\u2019ve listened to the whole series, you know that impact is real - and a BIG part of the developing news in Jason Carroll\u2019s case.\n\nYou can follow/listen to [Bear Brook](https://link.chtbl.com/7vVauHuF?sid=ama) on your favorite podcast app.",

Ideally, if we'd known way back when that we'd be doing a wholly new story in this feed years later, sure, we'd likely have given the feed an umbrella title and called season one Bear Brook. But...we didn't. And, this is a new investigative series by Jason Moon, with some of the same people, geography, and certainly the same journalism and production style of the first season. And of course, there's an audience there that we know really digs his reporting. So it made way more sense to explain to the audience that this is a new story, and to think of Bear Brook more as a brand than a literal description. \n\nHope that makes sense!",

I just wanted to say that I found Bear Brook season one incredibly compelling and well done, but I would say that season two is the most affected I've ever been by a podcast. I usually listen to podcasts when I'm running and frequently found myself slowing down or needing to turn off this podcast and take a break from it. I didn't feel like it was emotionally manipulative, but instead that it very effectively peeled back the many layers of complexity in our criminal system. I don't think I'll ever see that system the same way again, and I had considered myself fairly well informed about its serious flaws. Thank you for your excellent work. I can't imagine how hard it was to make this.",

YOU FOUND THE NAIL CLIPPINGS!  and the prosecutor blocks your attempt to test them for DNA?  That, above anything else in any case, has angered me more than I can remember.  Why not do the thing that can be found to ensure that you're definitely right?  But how do you /u/bearbrookpodcast and /u/rebeccalavoie resolve that fact in your mind that Jason is sitting in prison when DNA testing could potentially either fully show his guilt or innocence, but the people in power refuse to accept they might be wrong?!  I just can't get over that.",

Lots of unanswered questions remain which will probably never be answered, but the conveyance of new scientific advances (DNA/Interrogation Techniques) is incredibly fascinating and allow some optimism, despite past mistakes, that progress is being made in the criminal justice system.  \n\nBut I\u2019m having a hard time rooting for Jason to be released and I\u2019ll explain why in the form of a question:\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Jason willing to explain what happened back then? \n\nHe\u2019s not 19 years old being yelled at by investigators and his mom after days of interrogations, he worked with one of the prime suspects who absolutely knew the other prime suspect, his \u201cconfessions\u201d were all over the place and his final statement seems led and coerced, so why isn\u2019t he willing to say what his part actually was in it, if any?\n\nThank you for the work that you do. It is valuable, and it matters.",

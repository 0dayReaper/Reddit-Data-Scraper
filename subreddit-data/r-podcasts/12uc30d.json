    "postText": "I'm currently having an issue with upgrading Player FM and unresponsiveness from their customer support. The support team previously told me that my Gold membership can no longer be renewed because they've changed their payment system, and I have to register for a new upgrade (which is more expensive, as they've changed their premium plans).\n\nBut when I try to do that through my account, it just says to contact support. But they haven't been responding to my emails for the past couple weeks! My Gold membership is about to expire in 2 days at the end of the weekend, and I'm scared I will lose all my premium features - especially my saved playlists and synced play history.\n\nDo you have any advice about how to troubleshoot this, or how to make the support team respond to my emails? (I sent another one today.)\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to export my playlists into another podcatcher app?",

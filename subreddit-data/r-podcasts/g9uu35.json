    "postText": "Bren\u00e9 Brown (famous for her TED Talk on Vulnerability) started a new podcast recently and it has been such a ray of light for me during this crazy time.  She has about 6 episodes out right now and it's perfect because she picks guest speakers and their topics based on what would be helpful during a global pandemic. \n\nShe invites leading doctors, researchers, authors, etc. to have deep, unfiltered conversations with her on heavy topics. Some of the topics she's done so far are anxiety, being authentic (she speaks with Alicia Keyes), and dealing with loneliness which is so helpful during quarantine. \n\nJust wanted to share because I hadn't seen it mentioned here yet!",

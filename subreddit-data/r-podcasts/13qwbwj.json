    "postText": "Hi there! \n\nI'm searching for podcasts to get a good overview of US history from the very early times before actual US existed all the way to the modern era.\n\nHoping to find something that will help understand how the history has affected the country now but  also to understand the significance of events in a larger scale of the world....\n\n or just find an interesting podcast on US/North American history. I'm moving to US for exchange period and want to prepare myself a bit this way, so I'd be happy to look at any recommendations!!\n\nDocumentary recommendations are also welcome!",

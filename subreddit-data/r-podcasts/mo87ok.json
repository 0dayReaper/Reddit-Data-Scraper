Comedians seem to have that realization at the same time and they all start talking at the same time to riff on what was said. To the listener it comes across as noise, because no one voice can be heard.",

It was so annoying... made that part extremely hard to listen to.\n\nYou do NOT need to make those sounds of agreement all the time.  Well placed ones, if necessary, sure.  But for a podcast, I don't even think it's necessary.  The audience are interested to hear the information, not to hear the fact that you're listening to it also.\n\nAlso when someone makes an interesting point or reveals something that warrants further discussion and the host is not a good communicator/interviewer and just goes \"yeah\" and heads straight to their next written question.  No.  Work off the person you're talking to, when they say something interesting *follow* that thread and then come back to your pre-written questions later.\n\nA lot of people had podcasts now... plenty of them that don't really have the soft skills to carry one.",

I chose Clara Bow, an actress from the 1920\u2019s, because I didn\u2019t think there would be a ton of podcasts to sort through. It was kind of like a game of telephone. Each podcast got a little bit wrong, or they had drastically different sources. One podcast said that her mom fell out of a tree as a teen, when it was really her apartment building  window. Another podcast has so many mistakes (mispronouncing her name, saying that she won a silver dress and a statue as the grand prize of a fame and fortune contest, when really it was a silver statue and an ld dress (evening gown). There were many more mistakes, so I turned it off. \nI\u2019m a real stickler for details though, so learning information for the first time might not be such a turn off. \n\nI do like Just The Gist for new history stories that I know nothing about, so it\u2019s not like I won\u2019t listen to a podcast on something I know nothing about, but I wouldn\u2019t take it as gospel either. Just about everyone has a podcast, and not all of them are well researched, so consider the source.",

Recently got into the fragrance community like collecting colognes and stuff and was absolutely blown away there's podcasts for that lol. Besides that I'm a huge history fan and baseball fan so I'm listening to podcasts about all that stuff daily.",

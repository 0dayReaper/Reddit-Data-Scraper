    "postText": "Pretty much the title. I'm going to be driving a moving truck with my mom in about a month, and I want to find a podcast or two we can both enjoy on the way. We both like mystery and suspense, but unlike me, my mother does not like horror or surrealism. At all. And neither of us care for true crime.\n\nSo that's the gist of it. Fictional mystery that's not horror or surreal. I've found one called Limetown, but I don't know if it fits. Any and all advice would be appreciated!",

I've enjoyed all but maybe 2-3 of them out of 30 or 40 I've heard so far.  They are a wonderful distraction and cover just about anything and everything imaginable.  Highly recommend.  Enjoy your roadtrip!",

    "postText": "I'm curious to if there's a hip hop podcast that has a bit of a similar concept as filmspotting has for movies. So, like the hosts discussing the latest album releases, maybe do some occasional tournaments/rankings/games. It's kinda hard to describe, so couldn't really find much while initially looking for it, so I thought I'd ask here",

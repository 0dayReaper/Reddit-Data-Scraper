The first was on the use of evidence in medieval trials (like walking on hot steel, etc) and the second drew parallels to contemporary use of bad or unscientific evidence.",

Specifically, the episodes you're referring to may be from the third season of the podcast, which focused on the use of forensic evidence throughout history.\n\nThe first episode of the season is called \"Medieval Forensics,\" which explores the use of evidence in medieval trials, including trial by ordeal, and the second episode is called \"Modern Forensics,\" which compares historical and contemporary use of forensic evidence in trials",

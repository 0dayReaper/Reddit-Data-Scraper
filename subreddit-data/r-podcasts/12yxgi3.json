The emphasis is on trying to make it funny while still enjoying the music.\n\nI would also recommend [Trve.Cvlt.Pop](https://linktr.ee/trvecvltpop) which I'm not involved with at all but also fits the bill for what you're after.",

Each episode focuses on a song and features different people's stories of why/how that song is important to them. I'd love a podcast on metal/rock, though, so I'm checking out these other suggestions!",

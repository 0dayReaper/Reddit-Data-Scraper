The point is to identify what this part is worried would happen if it didn\u2019t control, and to work with it gently to heal what\u2019s behind that fear.",

She comes at it more from a spiritual/meditative angle, which usually I'm really not into, but I like her podcast a lot and get a lot out of it. The Happiness Lab also deals with issues related to control a lot, and I think it's the best of the \"human sciences\" podcasts that are out there.",

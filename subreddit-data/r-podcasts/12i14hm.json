Especially the first season of Radio Rental.\n\nRadio Rental is made by Payne Lindsey and his shows get some mixed reviews but there\u2019s a new one I think about UFOs called \u201cHigh Strangeness\u201d coming out in two weeks.\n\nThere\u2019s a show named Otherworld that just came out and some of the episodes make me roll my eyes but it\u2019s done incredibly well for a podcast that just started. I assume it will only get better.\n\nStuff You Should Know has creepy episodes here and there, they don\u2019t present them that way though.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening to southern gothic because I live in the south now and that\u2019s fun but the guy has this weird voice and cadence like he just kinda thinks he\u2019s supposed to. Kind of like the Batman voice- \u201cwhy are you talking like that\u201d\n\nEdit- also Ghosted by Roz Hernandez does it with a jokey approach. I haven\u2019t listened a ton but I\u2019ve enjoyed them\n\nAlso also, Last Podcast On The Left (a favorite of mine) did some episodes years ago where Listeners called in with their stories. There were two I think, named \u201cListener Pasta.\u201d I\u2019ve listened to the military one a bunch.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSince then I listened to high strange and it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s a Payne Lindsey show for sure so it just sorta jumps around.  Maybe a little narratively more together than previous ones.\n\nOtherworld still fucks",

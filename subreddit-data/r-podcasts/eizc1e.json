    "postText": "It must be free because I'm not being asked to confirm any payment, but I can hardly believe it's free. The content of the podcasts seems to be all quality stuff and there are hardly any commercials. \n\nReally late to this party. Only podcasts I've ever really checked out before were visual, mostly comedy (on Youtube, basically). \n\nI've seen that little Podcasts icon on my phone for years and never once was tempted to click it before. I just clicked it because someone told me I could listen to the Dirty John podcast there.\n\nSo far, I've just been checking out Wondery's stuff. I guess they specialize in true crime. Currently listening to Dr. Death because it had the highest rating of all of Wondery's stuff (5.0) but honestly it's not doing much for me. I thought The Shrink Next Door was more interesting.\n\nAny free ones on here I should check out?",

If you want historical context of modern events, Throughline is beautifully done. If you want to know about various infectious diseases, This Podcast Will Kill You is thorough and charming af. If you want to hear stories about people's lives, The Moth is everything from heartwarming to hysterical. Just about any type of knowledge you want, there are podcasts for it.",

Hmm. Not surprised, but it just made the podcast a lot more interesting because I wasn't exactly expecting that, either.",

So is Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet.  It's a pretty funny podcast where the hosts read really funny Yelp and Google reviews in a semi-dramatic fashion.  Also, My Favorite Murder and Small Town Murder are both hilarious podcasts with a darker twist, i.e. murder and jokes.\n\nThe Moth is always great because it is true stories told on stage.  Really interesting to hear some people's wild stories.\n\nRadiolab is great as well for more science-y stories but not too crazy science-y.  Some science podcasts can get so technical and dry that they are super hard to follow unless you hold a degree in the field they are about, but this one is for the layperson.",

The first dozen episodes are great, though I will say that the more recent one are mostly filler.\n\nMissing &amp; Murdered - (Both Seasons) TC about missing Indigenous women in Canada. Both weave in the historical treatment of the Canadian Indigenous people.\n\nNowhere Child - TC about the abduction of William Tyrrell in NSW. A foster child is abducted from his foster family in Australia. Privacy laws gum up the works in getting information out to the public.\n\nWho Killed... ? (Season 1) - Originally titled \"Who Killed Amy Mihaljevic?\" - TC about the unsolved abduction / murder of Amy Mihaljevic.\n\nAlmost forgot my favorite palate cleanser: This Sounds Serious - send up of all of the podcasts mentioned above.

I drive 3 hours a day, and listen to tons of podcasts - I only support 2 financially due to being a huge fan. \n\nIf you are into the more produced, sleek podcasts (like Wondery), check out Serial or Slow Burn. \n\nBut a huge corner of podcasting is just people talking, or celebrity interviews. For those, its best to just jump in and see if you enjoy the hosts. If you are not sure where to start with a show, and it is a show with guests, pick a guest you like or are familiar with. I think there are 750,000 podcast shows out now? You are bound to findmany you like, but often you have try many before you land on another you enjoy. I always feel like, \"That's it. I have what I like, I'm not going to find anything else I like as much as these.\" And then BAM, I hear about something and give it a try, and I am hooked to yet another. \n\nI am def more of a \"conversational podcast\" fan. My husband prefers newscasts and interviews.\n\nMy favorites are Hello Internet, Jordan Jesse Go, My Favorite Murder, And Thats Why We Drink, This Podcast Will Kill You, Good One, Conan O'Brien, A Mediocre Time with Tom and Dan, Podcast: The Ride, My Brother, My Brother, and Me, and Trends Like These, for a shorter/quick listen, Memory Palace is pretty awesome. . \n\nMy husband listens to a lot of NPR broadcasts,Bill Nye, and Startalk.",

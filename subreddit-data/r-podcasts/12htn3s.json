They talk about their relationship, relationships in general, and other things. \n\nAlso, a friend and I started a podcast, where we chat about our lives, things that irk us, some differences between our two countries as we live in the US and UK, and other things that we find interesting and amusing. It's called Talking Shit with a Yank and a Brit and is on a few different platforms like apple, spotify, castbox, google podcasts.",

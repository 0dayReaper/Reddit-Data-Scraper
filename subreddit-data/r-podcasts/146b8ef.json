            "comment": "Adventure Zone is great. The first few episodes they are really learning how to play the game, then it picks up and turns into an original campaign. Not an explicitly comedic plot but funny players. (It's by the 3 brothers from MBMBAM, and their dad)\n\nSitcom DnD is sort of DnD adjacent. It's mostly an ongoing improv show, inspired by DnD but each episode is a self contained mini plot. Very fun though. (They start off with a laugh track that is really offputting, but they get feedback and turn the laugh track down after a few episodes)\n\nHello from the Magic Tavern - not actually a DnD play podcast but sort of a fantasy world character improv podcast\n\nNot Another DnD Podcast - probably my favourite DnD actual play podcast of all time. It's not explicitly comedic, but they don't take it too seriously, there are plenty of dick jokes and goofy antics.\n\nBombarded - again not explicitly a comedic campaign, but lighthearted with lots of fun banter. Played by a bunch of music nerds who are in a band together (IRL), and they all play bards. Every episode they make a song by rolling chord dice, some of the songs are super funny.",

While something like Dungeons &amp; Daddies made me laugh far harder and more frequently; NaDDPOD *really* hits its stride around the time of the Galaderon saga, and is full of earnestly heartfelt character moments and awesome narrative arcs and moments.\n\nThat said while I truly adore the podcast, it *does* have some problems. They have a nasty habit of beating some rather puerile jokes (even by the show's standards or the standards of D&amp;Daddies IMO) into the ground well past the point of humor value, and the opening is a bit rough. Moonstone shapes up fine, but I think it pales in comparison to what came directly after it.",

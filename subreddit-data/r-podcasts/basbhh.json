Playing 911 clips against the wishes of the family is \"petty\". Guilting listeners for more donations with promises of more than 2 episodes of a month and never following through despite taking in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month is \"petty\". Making gross misogynistic jokes is \"petty\". Shitting all over the mentally ill is \"petty\". Playing unnecessary audio of kittens being suffocated and teenagers being murdered in cold blood is \"petty\". Asking a rape victim if the perp came inside her is \"petty\". Being an asshole on social media to fans and even to the families of the cases he covers is \"petty\". \n\nYou can disagree with me all you want, but the host is a fucking creep and shit bag and if that's the type of person you want to support, go for it. There is clear evidence of him being sexist, racist, and homophobic. Let's not forget the fact that he likes to drive drunk.\n\nIf you consider all the above shit he's done as petty, that says a lot about you. \n\nI used to be a big fan way back when it started. It was one of my first podcasts. I regret listening as long as a did. And Dont feel sorry for him, he fleeced his dumb patreon supporters for probably a few million dollars, he's doing alright.\n\nAnd the actual production is slick. I'll give him that. But the content itself is lazy. Copy and pasted audio clips with his shitty commentary sprinkled in. You'll realize that if you ever broaden your tastes and try other true crime podcasts that actually put effort in.",

When I was in high school, I was lulled to sleep by the voice of Peter Thomas on Forensic Files. Before I started listening to podcasts, it was rare to come across a story that I hadn't heard. Sword and Scale was the first one I listened to and I fell in love. I hadn't heard anything new in awhile. So maybe I'm biased.",

I hold my breath at some parts and didn't even realised it untill it was over, i love how its dramatic but yet very precise and the host didn't demonize Ulbricht but didn't try to make him some dramatic hero fighting society also. I feel like i could never have undestand this story clearly if it was in any other format.",

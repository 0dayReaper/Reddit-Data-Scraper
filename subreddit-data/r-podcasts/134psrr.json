I checked for name change /older episodes. \nIst this a bug or can a newer podcast take the spot of an older one, like when links are getting mismatched.",

I guess that like sometimes it can't download episodes saying the link was broken (or something like that), meaning that the link had changed then maybe other podcasts can get \"old\" links... Though I think that's not likely, even if possible.\n\nTry contacting Podcast Republic on Twitter. I often do that if I need to ask them anything and they're always helpful and quick to reply.\nIf you do, please let us know what they said. It's quite interesting.",

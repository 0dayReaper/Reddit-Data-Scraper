    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am doing a research project on Heaven\u2019s Gate and recently listened to the podcast that Parcast put out on this group. Their telling of the information was fantastic and they mentioned Dr. Janja Lalich, who I\u2019ve been sourcing in my paper. I\u2019ve been trying to find out if Parcast lists their sources anywhere and haven\u2019t had any luck. Specifically trying to find out more about the kind of people who joined this cult and why they did, which is something this podcast discussed. Any ideas? Thank you!",

Apologies for this site, annoying as heck on my phone at least:\n\nhttps://lastpodcastontheleftreadinglist.com/heavens-gate/",

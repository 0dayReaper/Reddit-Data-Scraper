As for your ask, I\u2019d recommend The Adventure Zone Balance and Dungeons and Daddies like other commenters here, along with Not Another D&amp;D Podcast.",

I sorta binged the first Y'all of the Cthulu series, and am now into the first of the shorter bonus stuff. I listen to maybe 3 or 4 episodes a day.\n\nI recommended ASN to my gaming buddies  who I haven't seen or much talked to since COVID began, and in doing so, we're reuniting for coffee, hopefully to \"get the band back together\"...so that's on you too.  Well done, yo!",

    "postText": "With the availability of podcasts now native to YouTube Music, I decided to swing on over to YouTube Music from Google Podcasts but there is no transfer tool from Podcasts to Music.\n\nI decided to do it the hard way and just search for my podcasts and subscribe to them in YouTube Music, playback history be damned.\n\nHowever, the FIRST podcast I search for doesn't exist in YouTube Music - that being \"The Dana Gould Hour\".\n\nFirst - am I missing a transfer tool to import my Google Podcast playback/favorites history into YouTube Music? I know for a FACT they had a transfer tool to go from Google Play Music to Google Podcasts (https://podcasts.google.com/transfer,  the link no longer works, but the tool existed then, why not now?)\n\nSecondly, anything I can do to ensure random podcasts like the Dana Gould Hour or others are searchable and subscribable in the native YouTube Music app? \n\nThanks /r/podcasts -\n\nYou've been nothing short of amazing in teaching me other things, hopefully you can teach me about this, too!",

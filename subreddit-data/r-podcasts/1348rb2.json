    "postText": "Hello all, I've been listening to different podcasts over the past few years and I think I've gotten myself into a bit of a rut... \n\nAnyone have any good recommendations that maybe aren't as well-known? I've enjoyed fictional, multi-character voice acted podcasts the most (like Limetown, Borrasca, Ars Paradoxica, The Bright Sessions, The Black Tapes etc)\n\nAny recommendations will be appreciated. I'll also take recommended nonfiction ones, if they're as good as The Lazarus Heist, Unraveled, Conviction, Hunting Warhead etc.\n\nI need something nice and engaging for my everyday commute. Thanks y'all!",

I'll be definitely checking some of these out, but some I've already heard, which only makes me more trusting of y'alls recommendations lol\n\nI do like comedy, but haven't tried that many in podcast form (Mother hacker, Classified etc)... So i guess I have more in that genre to check out. \nAlso wouldn't mind some horror type, like The left right game and Edge of Sleep.\n\nThanks already for all the cool recommendations.",

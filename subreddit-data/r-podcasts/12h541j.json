    "postText": "Trying to find a podcast episode and I can\u2019t remember for the life of me what show it was or what the episode was called. Listened to it in October 2022. It was a story about a woman in the modern era who visits Sleepy Hallow around Halloween and is haunted by the ghost of the headless horseman. I can\u2019t remember many details about it other than that she attends a local festival while there and wears a purple dress, wakes up at some point to the ghost in her bed, and something about a bridge near an old tree being important towards the end of the story. Loved the episode and would love to listen to it again. I think it was pretty long, at least an hour and maybe split into parts. Would be forever grateful if someone knows what I\u2019m talking about and can tell me what podcast it was!",

Imagine you favorite true crime podcast and it's ability to pace the story however they see fit, vs a tv show that is forced to stretch or condense the material to 44 minutes. I remember seeing a dateline or something similar years ago that recapped the entire story every single time they came back from commercial, it was terrible.  Podcasts offer the best case scenario.  They are beholden to no one but the story itself. It's terrific, and I feel fortunate to be around to watch this medium evolve.",

Personally I can't stand the argument - both pretty clearly have some story-telling advantages, as well as some deficiencies. It's pretty easy to see how that's the case with podcasts too. There are positives -  more freedom with time constraints, an easier avenue for having all listeners catch every episode instead of missing some. But there are some obvious downsides compared to other mediums - the lack of visuals is a pretty obvious one lol. There is also certainly the same pressure to stretch stories out into a longer number of episodes - not all podcasts will fall victim to this, but many have the same problem as the TV shows you might complain about stretching a story into the modern standard 13 hour-long episodes. \n\nAt the end of the day, podcasts are a perfect medium for ... some stories. TV and film also have their own strengths, and are equally great for other stories as well as other individuals.",

All of that in one would be amazing.\n\nEDIT: Wow, you guys are amazing! I can't comment on each one, but thank you all for the suggestions\n\nEDIT 2: I found some fantastic playlists on Spotify. This one in particular has news, war announcements, stories, music, and advertising. I listened to it on shuffle, and it was like I was back during the WW2 era. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/5uza17cz0bCYjWRnuPdoZs?si=0irt54DRT02yQGZ_wFjL-A",

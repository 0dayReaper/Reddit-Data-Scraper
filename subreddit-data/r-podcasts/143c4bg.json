    "postText": "I am looking for an unsolved mystery (or true crime) podcast, preferably on Spotify, that is also funny and similar in format to buzzfeed unsolved where they explain the case but there is also banter and jokes, as I scare easily and that helps ease the scary parts! I wish the ghoul boys made a podcast but since they haven\u2019t I would love to be introduced to anything similar! Thank you!",

It's not \"spooky\" in a true crime sense, but it's kind of like if Stephen King wrote poetry. The only banter is the very beginning where they're like \"thanks for listening, now please enjoy the show blah blah\". It's freaky as hell sometimes, some of the imagery has stuck with me even though I listened to it like 2 years ago.",

I've always liked Dolly, from the tidbits I knew about her, and i loved a few random songs of hers, but hearing her tell her story and wax poetic about music, writing and life in general on DPA...it was just, wow. What an impressive, intelligent, extremely talented gem of a human being. 5 star podcast.",

I listened to it and I starred it in pocket casts but now it's nowhere to be found. The name of the podcast channel may have been something like \"the big question\" or\"big something else\", I thought it was \"big think\" but they've removed their shows from app and on YouTube they do have a section with Stephen but it's not the one I listened to. \n\nIn the one I listened to her talked about Beethoven and how he was one of the first of the archetype of the \"tortured genius\" and that he would write letters to his brothers lamenting his lack of hearing and all that. I'D REALLY REALLY REALLY LIKE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN IF SOMEBODY HAS AN IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. MUCH THANKS.",

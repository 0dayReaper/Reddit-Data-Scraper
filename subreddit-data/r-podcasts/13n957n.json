Sadly, they've got steelo episodes on their own platform that I can't afford to subscribe to. Any of y'all know of similar podcasts? Like those long-ass TV shows where the characters become your amigos.\n\nhttps://pca.st/episode/af32f81a-0ed9-4062-9880-73f2c743b9bf\n\nor\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?i=1000613766526",

It\u2019s a waste of time to me of both of them just incoherently rambling about things that have nothing to do with the thesis of the show. I really enjoy a lot of the content, but I have noticed somewhat of a decline in what I would consider their quality (although I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an audience for it). Their most recent serial killer series on Belle Gunness was so unfunny and cringe worthy I had to turn it off, which I\u2019ve never had to do for them.

Then for the ambitious, maybe a mic actually on the crowd to get their reactions more clearly. The mix in the end would not by much more difficult, maybe even easier.\n\nSource: 20 year live sound &amp; recording engineer\n\nAnyway, I agree, many of my favorite podcasts I enjoy in large part for the friend-on-your-shoulder close-up, nearly ASMR, feel of the audio. The Hello From the Magic Tavern live episodes can be some of the funniest, but the live\\* audio is always so distracting I put off listening to them.",

We tried the pilot on a road trip and there was an extended period of actual whispering that I'm not sure we were supposed to understand but we definitely didn't understand when the sound had to compete with road noise. We're going to try it again in a quieter environment but it'd be good to get a read on whether the overall quality improves with time.",

In fact, they joke about how bad the first handful of episodes are in episode 99 (just listened yesterday). Of course, it's still improv and there is no script, but  they rarely break the 4th wall. Sometimes they make aesthetic choices I wouldn't, like panning Chunt hard left, but whatever. It's worth it to have Usidore whispering his indecipherable wizard state into my ear.",

In fact, i like hearing the excitement or laughter of the crowd more than just hearing the episode in a sterile vacuum. I sometimes even have trouble going back to normal episodes after listening to live ones, because i miss having the audience in the background, haha. \n\n I sometimes go through JUST the live episodes of No Such Thing As A Fish, because i usually like them so much more than the studio episodes (not saying those are bad, just personal preference). Same with MBMBAM, but those also have some audience participation, at least. Hell, one of my favorite podcasts - Mortified - is exclusively and completely live recordings (which may or may not be part the reason it's one of my favorites). Normal Podcast episodes are fine if it's a show focused on conveying Information in a neat package, like 99% Invisible or Reply All. But with anything else that is more free-form or casual or \"banter-y\" than that, i will usually enjoy live episodes *slightly* more than the normal content.",

Not only is the sound quality usually worse, but recording for a live audience also gives a different energy to the show. If we're in our usual setting we're just having a conversation amongst friends. In front of an audience it becomes more of a performance, which is more fun for the live audience but less so for the listener at home who just wants that conversation.",

If you really like a podcast and don't buy stuff from them, you can at least suffer through some worse quality to help them stay alive\n\nI know it's different some like NSTAAF, where I believe they're totally funded by QI.\n\nIf your favorite podcast was doing a live recording where you live, would you go? It also seems like a great way to connect with your listeners.\n\nGive it like 10 years and podcasts will be doing live shows from the studio via VR/AR. Then it'll be the best of both worlds!",

The live episodes still have the same structure as a recorded episode, but it does leave room for listener interaction. But you have to know how to get back on topic and not let it derail. And you also have to listen more for production value. You have to go into it knowing you are going to have to work harder to make the show sound good. Most podcasters unfortunately don't do that. I have been doing podcasting and fm radio for over a decade and I consider myself an amateur. Mindset like that makes me want to improve every show and it's never good enough. Jackasses who think they have made it are the ones who fail when it comes to production in my opinion.",

There are some podcasts that have great content in their live show but I have to babysit the volume button every time the sound of the crowd swells.",

And then, for the most important episode of the series up to that point, an *unlistenable* two hour live show with  loud cheering and clapping (to the point that the actors often had to *wait for the cheering to die down* before continuing).

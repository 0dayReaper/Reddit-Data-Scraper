            "comment": "Minding Scripture is (or maybe was; they just stopped making new episodes over a year ago with no explanation) a podcast by some professors at Notre Dame who approach different topics or figures described in the Bible and the Qur\u2019an by looking at how they showed up in the relevant texts and how Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their specific views about them over time. They often have other important Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scholars in the religious studies field on to discuss these topics as well. There aren\u2019t a lot of episodes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ones they\u2019ve released",

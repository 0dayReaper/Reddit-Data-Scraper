I had this while fucking revelation in college where I was rediscovering comic books again and simultaneously having my mind blown that the guy who played silent bob talked like crazy (and was a director, something I never knew). \n\nAnyways, those two episodes helped me a lot in college. I was studying for my BFA in graphic design and was dealing with a lot of outside influences that were reminding me that \u201coh this isn\u2019t a good idea, it\u2019s an art degree, you\u2019ll never get a job, you need a backup\u201d etc etc. hearing what those guys went through and how they struggled, just like everyone else, helped me more than you could imagine. \n\nThat was already ten years ago.

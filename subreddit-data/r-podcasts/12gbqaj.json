    "postText": "As someone who easily gets distracted and can\u2019t read continuously, these long reads have been helpful. I find that listening to them relaxes me with the soothing and calm voice - a quality that other listeners may find to be boring or make them sleepier. \n\nI\u2019ve listened to a lot of long reads but my favorite is \u201cAthleisure, barre, and kale: The tyranny of the ideal woman\u201d. Written by Jia Tolentino, it\u2019s an essay that still sticks with me years after. Another (I forgot the title) essay I\u2019ve listened to is about mental health and capitalism. It opened my mind about seeing mental health not just as an individual thing but as effects of the world we live in under capitalism.\n\nWhat are your favorite long reads/recommendations?",

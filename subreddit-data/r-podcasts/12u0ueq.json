    "postText": "I saw a post about Glennon Doyle's podcast and it made me wonder what podcasts are out there that feel like the genuinely equivalent of that. By folks that have been through really hard things (whatever that might be) and talk about it in a way that doesn't feel preachy or like they've tied their story up in a neat little bow if that makes sense. I love hearing about people's genuine, real experiences and it feels like a lot of the folks out there are speaking from places of polished authority, which is fine, just not what I super enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! :)",

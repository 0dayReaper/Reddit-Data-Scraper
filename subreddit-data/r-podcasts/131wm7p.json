Since the trial started I did an overview of the case on my YouTube channel and each week I give an overview of the current week in court. Hope it can be helpful! :)",

Both of them give  real-time updates on Twitter, then recap on YT. Both have vast libraries of info since they have done coverage since the start. Lauren is married to a forensic psychologist (pardon me if I just changed Dr. Mathias career\ud83e\udd23).Together, they do deep dives into the mad mind of Lori Vallow. Check them out. They are the Rolls Royce ride.",

They've got a whole series on her and they put out new episodes when there are updates in the trial. \n\nFair warning it's a podcast put out by one of our local news channels so it might feel more newsy than entertaining but it's great with the facts and some different interviews. \n\nThey've also done a series on the zombie hunter killer, Robert Fisher, and the Sedona sweat lodge deaths, and a few other random local crimes. It's pretty interesting. \n\n\nThe Lori Vallow series seems to be it's own feed called Lori Vallows Deadly delusions.",

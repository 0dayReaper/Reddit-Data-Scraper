    "postText": "This is a combined shower thought/intellectual itch I haven't been able to scratch and naturally podcasts are my first outlet for anything that fits that definition in my life. Are there any pods you guys have stumbled on that explains the evolutionary basis for why some humans are adapted for certain skills that humans themselves have invented? For instance, evolutionarily speaking, sports are a completely arbitrary byproduct of human existence and have no inherent value to our survival. SO. How and why is Steph Curry so good at putting a ball through a basket? Why is he so much better than the average joe at doing so? What is the neuroscientific basis for such skills? I hope I articulated this well enough and that what I'm trying to ask resonates with others. Give me pods!!",

Each episode usually features a deep dive into the subject with three EXPERT guests who are always passionately explaining the minutia of the subject while the host guides their explanations from begging to end by interjecting very well crafted questions. It\u2019s \u201cthe smartest podcast in the world\u201d in my view.",

For me, I would have to say This is Actually Happening 9/11 series The Long Shadow, specifically the one of the ER doctor. \n\nLooking forward to see what y\u2019all\u2019s opinions are!",

She made a [video](https://youtu.be/BjfT6H6QUIA) to promote the vaccine to encourage others to get vaccinated, while singing an updated version of Jolene, then Dr. Abumrad gives her the shot.

Robert Evans goes deep on his research and it shows. He\u2019s also a great writer so his scripts pop. This series engrossed me in particular! \n\nLPOTL\u2019s series on L Ron Hubbard is one of their best.

They aren\u2019t standalone episodes so it does require keeping track of characters and so forth. I hate to say that it starts out as three brothers and their dad playing D&amp;D because then some people will not give it a chance. My son had to bribe me into listening to it with him. Think of it more like improv, where one person has the whole story arc in mind and guides the other three as they role-play the parts. It helps that they are professional comedians, and one of them is a professional radio announcer. It starts out goofy and really jokey, and there are a lot of laughs in most of the scenes, but the story develops into something to give you all the feels. I don\u2019t know how to explain it better without spoilers. \n(Edit for word and punctuation.)",

Recommend: Episode 63 - Tony Gang Flame War (5TH BIRTHDAY EPISODE!), and Episodes 33 and 34 - Exorcist Dave Stewart. \n\n**Derry Public Radio -** A Stephen King book club podcast. A wonderful mix of manic energy (Josh and Ben) and naughty ASMR librarian (C.M.), they bring irreverent insight to everything from King's books to short stories to screenplays. Recommend: the Dreamcatcher miniseries, starting with Episode 94 \"Oh, Grow Up, C.M.\",  or any of the annual March Madness miniseries episodes. \n\n**Story Break** - Probably my favorite podcast of all time, \"three Hollywood screenwriters have one hour to BREAK a hit film\". Wild energy from the three cohosts and lifelong friends (the minds behind Video Game High School, Dungeons &amp; Daddies and Dimension 404), but also deep and insightful looks at the craft of character and storytelling. Recommend: Episode 41 \"Duke Nukem\", Episode 59 \"Creepy Crawlers\", or their final miniseries where they make an entire MOVIE SCRIPT one scene at a time, \"Jar Jar: Portrait Of A Hero\".",

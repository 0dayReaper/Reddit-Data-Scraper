I don\u2019t know how it got made with such high production values. The parody of Lore in the third season alone deserved a Nobel Prize.\n\nDone Disappeared stands as a towering colossus among spoof podcasts. Give it a listen. You won\u2019t\u2026\n\n\nBe disappointed.",

I was captivated by her sister\u2019s story, and really drawn in when she created her own podcasts. \n\nThey are  \u201cDisappearances\u201d and \u201cVoices For Justice\u201d. I love her voice, it is perfect for the stories that she is telling. But since her own sister was a victim, she has an unrivaled sense of empathy that touches me in every single episode. \n\nIt\u2019s a serious podcast where she usually has a call for action, like to sign a petition, etc. I look forward to every episode, &amp; I always take advantage of her calls for action, where we can actually do something to help right the wrongs \u2696\ufe0f",

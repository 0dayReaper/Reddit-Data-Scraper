I don't have the patience to keep coming back to something several hours long.        \nI've got a huge library on non fiction, mostly science podcasts, this was my first fiction and I loved it and would like to try more.\nI enjoy all sorts of genres so any suggestions appreciated.            \nI have PocketCasts and Spotify Premium.",

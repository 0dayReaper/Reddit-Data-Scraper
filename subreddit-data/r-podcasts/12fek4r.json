    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m hoping I can be pointed in the right direction for some binge worthy podcasts!  \n\nIn particular, I\u2019m looking for a podcast that has a similar vibe to certain videos I like to watch on YouTube. A few different channels do what I have in mind (e.g. vanity fair, GQ, wired, lad bible etc) and basically they get an expert in their field to give insight to the realities of their job. A really common theme is having ex-FBI agents, or secret service members, or Marines etc debunking myths like parts of their job Hollywood fakes in movies, and general behind-the-scenes discussions. There are so many different ones - astronauts, ex-mob bosses, doctors - just a huge variety of different people telling stories from their job. \n\nSo I\u2019m just wondering if anyone knows of an interview type podcast with a wide variety of experts, or even just regular people sharing their life story. \n\nAnother channel I love is Soft White Underbelly, if that helps with recommendations! \n\nThank you for any suggestions!",

It is very chatty but I\u2019ve learned a lot from it. \n\nIt\u2019s a series, but I just finished Season 1 of Talk To Me about the formation of the NYPD hostage negotiation unit. It was fascinating. \n\nI have a tendency to like deep dive podcasts hosted by insiders and get the details of their job as they tell the story.\n\nDeath of an Artist is hosted by an insider in the art world.\n\nMissing Pages is hosted by a literary insider. \n\nKilled is stories behind journalists having their stories killed - fascinating. \n\nOutside/In just did a story about the mushing community in Alaska \u2014 also fascinating\n\nAs for regular people telling life stories \u2026 so many great interview pods \u2026 \n\nSecret Room\n\nFamily Secrets\n\nWhat Was That Like\n\nThis is Actually Happening (host is edited out, makes for a very intriguing tone) \u2014 soft white underbelly-esque\n\nSnap Judgment \n\nLove+Radio also reminiscent of S.W.U. imo \n\nHere Be Monsters (check out Ancient Roman Recipes episode, fits this bill of the details of someone\u2019s job and was just a delight for me to listen to as a break from tougher subject matter)",

It\u2019s about the FBIs questionable use of informants to keep tabs on BLM  activists. It includes interviews with former FBI agents.\n\nAlso, Real Narcos might interest you. It was about efforts of US and Columbian authorities to disrupt the drug trade in Columbia. It was well sourced with DEA and other law enforcement agents as I recall. It\u2019s been a minute since I listened to that one.",

Ironicly left right game is the first ad that got me into them and after listening too hundreds i yet have to find something as good because of the reasons you specified. Its super good short production , without overdoing things or dragging it out. with the perfect blend of supernatural and keeps you guessing. Top notch acting, likeable characters that grow on you instantly (rob), easy to tell apart actors, easy to follow (well minus the last episode i had to replay haha) and keeps you glued untill the very end. \n\nSome i liked\nStation 151\nDon't mind Cruxmont\nTower 4\nThe Burned Photo\nThe Mantawauk Caves\nThe edge of sleep\nThe case of charles dexter ward \nCarrier\nIf you want something goofy and fun check out Midnight Burger\n\nI got alot more. None of them really comparable to LRG tho",

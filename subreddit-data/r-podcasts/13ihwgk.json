    "postText": "Maybe I\u2019m just an idiot\u2026\n\nBut I can\u2019t figure out how to binge a podcast without wanting to throw something out the window.\n\nI tried using Amazon podcasts. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m on episode 200 of Freakonomics. I say Alexa play Freakonomics Radio, and it will resume episode 200 right from where I left off. About two minutes later, it will start playing the most recent episode, completely unbidden.  If I want to get back to the episode I was listening to, I have to open the app and then I have to search for it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried using Apple podcasts. When I ask Siri to play Freakonomics, she can\u2019t understand when I ask for a particular episode, and will only ever go to the most recent episode. And then, if I want to find the episode that I was on I need to go in and search for it manually. \n\nIs there just no good solution for voice-activated podcast listening?",

Even if it can\u2019t, I don\u2019t understand why the default wouldn\u2019t be to pick up where I left off.",

It understands skip [insert time in minutes] and pause and resume so I don't have to listen to adverts and intros etc. or miss anything when I grab a cuppa from the kitchen which is a boon. Because I use podcast addict on android it's basically a cast from google home to the speaker. It's not perfect but it's better than not using it.",

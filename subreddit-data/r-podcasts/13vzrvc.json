    "postText": "Hello folks!\n\nDo any of you guys have issue with the [podcasts.google.com](https://podcasts.google.com) when trying to listen to podcasts? When I try to press \"subscriptions\", \"queue\" or any other parts of the left menu I can't seem to be able to press them! It's almost like they're not there. The only part on the left side that I can press is the hamburger icon at the top of the left corner..\n\nThis is such a strange issue that I just noticed..\n\nHaven't been using the website but I wanted to listen to some podcasts while being on my PC but now I can only access the \"explore shows\" page because I cannot click on anything else on the left hand side!\n\nEdit: manually typing for instance \"/subscriptions\" works apparently but it's not really handy to have to type it like this.. What's going on? I've tested it on Chrome, Edge and Firefox with the same results! It seems to work on mobile but not on desktop..  \n\n\nEdit 2: got a email from Google telling me that they have addressed the issue. That was very fast! ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m hoping this group can help me. Back in 2017-2018 I remember listening to an episode or two of a podcast. The premise, from what I remember, was a neutral host bringing on guests from conflicting backgrounds (e.g., Israeli and Arab, LGBTQ and conservative Christian, etc.). I don\u2019t remember much past that, but I was listening to \u201cTerrible, Thanks for Asking\u201d at the time, and I remember it having a similar vibe. The show wasn\u2019t boisterous, but was meant to be a productive conversation. Any ideas?",

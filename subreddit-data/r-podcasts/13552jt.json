    "postText": "Listened to Wondery, American History Teller, Accomplice or Martyr? Disappointing. I wanted actual details about the event, not how it was a very popular trial. What happen in the boarding house? Where is the evidence? There was a comparison to the JFK and OJ trial, weak navel gazing. There was no time line of the actual event just repeat of how big an event the trial was.",

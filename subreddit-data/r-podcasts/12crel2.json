    "postText": "I'm trying to find podcasts about Hell, Heaven, or similar theological topics that are done as a study/discussion of symbolism and culture, and very specifically not podcasts with an overt bias done by vocal Christians or Satanists who have a heavy bias in the interpretation.  More passion about the exploration of the topic, caring less or not at all about what it might mean for one's immortal soul.\n\nBasically, I want to listen to podcasts about Hell, Heaven, Purgatory, etc., by people who have the same nerdy passionate exploration as podcasts I have seen exploring the lore of Skyrim or Magic the Gathering or Dungeons and Dragons, etc.  Less personal opinion, more fascination, research, and wild speculation.",

You can find discussions on the development of ideas about heaven and hell, Satan, salvation etc. in the Literature and History, History in the Bible, the History of the Papacy, the History of Persia podcasts and more, all of which talk about the development of these doctrines through Judaism, Greek philosophy, early Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism and more. Literature and History is particularly good.\n\nThere is also Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean, which might only be on Apple Podcasts. It\u2019s a recording of university lectures on religion from the Greco-Roman world through early Christianity that takes in the origin of heaven and hell, among other things.",

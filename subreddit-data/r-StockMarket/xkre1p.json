Her husband isn't simply a \"fund manager.\" He is someone who has had mathematically impossibly successful results trading on stocks in which his wife has a major say in regulating or in giving government contracts. This isn't the sham \"blind trust\" BS a lot of pols pretend insulates their knowledge from how their money is managed. It's outright, in your face, blatant corruption and \"fuck you if you question us\" behavior.\n\nI don't know who you think is \"the man behind the curtain\" is but it's these bankers &amp; these Congressional Reps  all conspiring together and feasting on caviar and champagne together while chortling about the poors starving and soon freezing to death while they stack cash like the sociopaths they are.\n\nLet's put ALL their heads on a stake. Pelosi, Hollingsworth, ALL the bank CEOs &amp; every single government employee found to have traded on stocks in which they had inside information. Intelligent people can recognize that this world has MANY villains and they all need to be held to account. Don't pretend that only some need their heads on pikes. They ALL do.",

Seriously. I'd love to know who bears MORE responsibility for rampant corruption and insider trading than Pelosi. Sure, some people have traded their entire portfolios on single pieces of info like Burr, NC selling out entirely after getting the COVID briefing but that was like $1.5M and likely done because he's an idiot who held no hedges against a downturn. Pelosi's husband trades on insider info in amounts more than that every single day while his wife controls the rules that allows him to do it. There is an argument that it's more corrupt to sell out the public to corporations but Pelosi does that every day as well and, again, controls the ability to change it. McConnell or others might be arguably more EVIL but they're pretty upfront about it and until proven otherwise I can't see who exactly could be more CORRUPT than Pelosi.\n\nDisclaimer: Trump is the worst thing to maybe ever happen to America. MAGATS are morons and fully enthrall to an evil cult but anyone who defends the Democratic Party is either not paying attention or similarly enthralled to a cult mentality of \"my team\" is virtuous simply because the other side is worse in some ways",

They leave a long lasting impact on our country in order to sway levels of power, enrich themselves and benefit their constituents. In some cases the damage they cause may take years to undo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou chose Mitch McConnell as an example, so lets use him. He blocked Obamas SC pick because the election was 11 months away. He then approved two SC justices appointed by Trump with the election only 2 months away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose justices changed the entire voting power of the court. In less than a year that court has done a lot of damage. Damage that, again, will take years to undo. Do you not see that as more corrupt? Is it better because he is \"up front about it\" as you so eloquently put it?",

Republicans will do whatever they say, just like the guy in this video. And Democrats are still quite business friendly and know they will lose if they try to challenge the rich. (Some Democrats do try to sometimes pass bank regulations or campaign finance reform, but it gets shut down by conservative Democrats, Republicans, and the Supreme Court.)\n\nWe voters deserve much of the blame. Since most of us don't even pay attention to which party is doing what. Along with politicians and the rich who have no sense of integrity and justice. It takes all of us to improve things, or the system doesn't work.",

In the near future that will be the case. Furthermore, you geniuses forget that interest rates on the debt matter. Look up how much of the national debt is rolled over in near term bonds. As those rates go up, the cost of borrowing goes up dramatically. You fucking people are so confidently wrong it's staggering. That's okay though.

The government issues the currency; it's not like it could run out of money and be forced to default. It can always pay the existing debt by issuing new debt. Under the current rules of the system there is no external limit to the amount of debt that can be issued. The only constraints are those that the government voluntarily imposes on itself. This can be arguably a good thing - for example, I like that Congress sets a budget rather than letting federal agencies spend at will - or it can be a bad thing - like the debt ceiling which does nothing but give radical obstructionists a loaded gun with which they can extract concessions.",

I'd encourage you to open your mind to possibilities outside of the conclusions you've come to. Where does \"currency\" come from???? Currency when printed comes about through BORROWING. We borrow money in the form of bonds to print more money. The constraints on debt are not voluntarily imposed... they are made up of confidence held in society that the borrower can repay the debt. Once the people lending money lose confidence, it's all a wash. Do I agree that the debt ceiling is political theater? Sure. Furthermore, if you really study economics you will see that Gov't money, i.e. the share of GDP that comes from government spending, and not from the private sector, is 1, usually misallocated/misspent, and 2, crowds out the private sector. These and other deleterious effects ruin the economy. There is most definitely a such things as over utilization of debt. A country is the same as a company which is the same as a household... they are truly constrained by how much they make/produce. If a household makes 1000 a month, that's how much they have to spend. Everything past that is debt/using the currency or CONFIDENCE. Once that confidence runs out, you're cut off. It's simple. To think that a country, regardless of which one, can overcome basic economics is stupidity due to over abundance and your privilege. It's what leads to the fall of all empires. Take the Roman empire as an example. They all fall because they lose connection with financial reality.",

It is ideology unsupported by facts. Particularly wrong is the idea that government borrowing \"crowds out\" investment.  Government spending doesn't prevent anyone from making new investments. It doesn't change the cost of borrowing. That's because the price of government debt is not decided by the market but by the central bank. New money can always be created through borrowing at the current interest rate.\n\n\"Crowding out\" might be a legitimate criticism of government borrowing in a world with a fixed supply of money - like a gold standard. In such a system, the quantity of base money truly is limited, and therefore government borrowing truly does prevent that money from being used elsewhere in the economy. But we have not even had a gold exchange standard, let alone a true gold standard, for half a century now. There is no reason to let our thinking be limited by constraints that have not existed for generations. These days, credit can always be created at the going interest rate. Which means there is no \"crowding out\" effect. In fact it's the opposite - private funds actually \"crowd in\", because when the government is deficit spending in an area, that means there is a business opportunity otherwise would not have existed. If the government announces its intention to use deficit spending to buy a bunch of new guns, that incentivizes the gun maker to invest in a new factory. The rate of interest that he will pay on the money he borrows to do so is the same as it otherwise would have been, but because of government deficit spending, that investment makes sense where it otherwise would not have.\n\n&gt;The constraints on debt are not voluntarily imposed... they are made up of confidence held in society that the borrower can repay the debt.\n\nWhen it comes to the US government, the borrower CAN always repay the debt. The US government cannot be forced to default on dollar denominated debt. It must voluntarily choose to do so. For various reasons, it is not possible that the government could run out of buyers for its debt - absent some radical change or shock to the system, like serious monetary reform or the actual failure of the government itself. As long as people are still accepting dollars, they will use them to buy treasuries.\n\n&gt;A country is the same as a company which is the same as a household\n\nThis right here tells me that you don't understand money. The federal government is unlike any other entity when it comes to spending and issuing debt. Households, businesses, state and local governments, and foreigners must obtain dollars. Only the US Federal government can create dollars. It is not constrained in how much it can spend. It is technically perfectly possible for Congress to authorize trillions in new spending and raise the debt ceiling to allow that. In fact we just did that during the covid pandemic. Look at all that new spending; look at the jump in the money supply. Where did that money \"come from\"? Was it just sitting around waiting to be borrowed? No. Does the fact that the government spent new money on stimulus checks prevent them from spending money on other things? No. Did it prevent anyone in the economy from borrowing, or impact significantly the cost of borrowing? No.\n\nThere are real resources, and real constraints. The government can't hire more people than exist in the United States. It can't buy more oil than is for sale in dollars. But the dollars itself are not a constraint. There is nothing to prevent the United States government from spending money. The question is how to use that power to build a political economy that's mutually beneficial for everybody.",

Although I do not believe the US Gov exerting it's powers around the globe is the reason it's backed by the constitution, I get how taxing adds value to currency when borrowing money devalues it. Thank you.\n\nHowever, I don't see how taxing the rich solves major issues. Wouldn't skewing taxation towards the rich just encourage them to just find ways to avoid it as they do now. I know I would rather place a greater emphasis on Congress's spending limit they break so often, so that we don't have to keep causing inflation/ wasted tax money; at least spend the tax money more in the American economy than enforcing ourselves as the \"Global Police Force\".",

Rather tax 1,000 people that get they're jobs from 1 billionare if you get my point. That's why to prevent lower/middle classes from suffering from taxes, I'd rather place a greater emphasis on regulating Congress, because once you see how much shit they be inserting in the US economy you can't believe it. Little bit of a rant I know, but releaseing trillion dollar packages into the economy when inflation was on the rise was /is so risky.

They are already technically taxed at a very high rate. The problem is the black magic fuckery they use to not ever pay anywhere close to the portion that they should. They spread out money, use companies, donations, and the best lawyers/accountants in the world, and they don\u2019t end up paying shit. \u201cRaising\u201d taxes on the rich literally wouldn\u2019t do anything. It would all be avoided and written off somehow, like it all is currently. We don\u2019t need new taxes on the rich, or to increase them, we just need to enforce the laws and actually force the rich to pay their part.\n\nEdit: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should rely too much on the rich.\u201d What does that mean? We have billionaires with 20+ homes and yachts and gold toilets paying basically nothing in taxes, and people living in poverty giving up over a 5th of their check from 2 different jobs struggling to pay rent and feed their kids. Nobody is asking for charity out here. We don\u2019t want the rich to pay our bills out of the goodness of their heart and \u201crely\u201d on them - we want wealth to be distributed (not concentrated in the 1% and .1%) and the rich to pay their taxes and to close the many loopholes that allow massive corporations and massively wealthy people to pay an extremely low amount of taxes (relatively). \n\nI definitely understand where you are coming from. But I think this is one of those things where you should try to reserve judgement/not form opinions until you understand the issue more clearly. I am at the same spot, I won\u2019t talk about it anymore either because I don\u2019t think I am knowledgeable enough to form a nuanced decision. Politics and economics and monetary policy are really fuckin complicated, but people in our country love to talk loud and proud about them and have strong opinions when they really don\u2019t understand anything more than superficially. Just be wary of those people, and be wary of being one of those people.\n\nAlso, I think you should do some reading on monetary policy, the fed, national interest rates, and the stimulus package you are talking about. I\u2019m not claiming to be some expert on it. But, \u201c$1 trillion = inflation = bad\u201d is a very very generalized and superficial view of what actually happens with something like that. I don\u2019t claim to know the situation myself, but I know it\u2019s far more complex than regulating congress and bigger money supply = inflation = bad. I\u2019ve taken entire semester college courses on macroeconomics and monetary policy and even I hardly understand this shit.\n\nAnd, I\u2019m really not trying to be mean or condescending, Im genuinely just trying to point out how complex it all is and that it\u2019s really easy to fall into the trap of having an opinion based on a very over-simplified understanding of things, which makes it very easy for the ultra rich and politicians with power to pit us all against each other.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not talking about people worth a few million bucks. I\u2019m talking the lower than 1%, the people so obscenely rich they couldn\u2019t possibly spend all their money if tried.",

If wealthy individuals/families/corporations ACTUALLY paid taxes at the rate they were supposed to (minus the standard deduction, or, hell, I'd be willing to get rid of that if suitable amounts of money were actually flowing from the upper-upper crust to the IRS) then that would be fine.\n\nBut we all know there are a bazillion and one deductions and loopholes that prevent billionaires and corporations from paying...really anything, actually.\n\nThe problem isn't the rates on the books. It's that there's no way to actually enforce them.",

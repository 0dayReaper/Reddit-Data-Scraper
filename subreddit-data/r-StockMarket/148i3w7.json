    "postText": "Hey fellow Redditors! Just stumbled upon some exciting news in the biopharmaceutical sector, and I couldn't help but share it with you all. Atossa Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ATOS) is making waves with its innovative medicines in oncology, particularly focusing on breast cancer. The article I found highlights the latest progress in their Phase 2 EVANGELINE study, which aims to develop a groundbreaking treatment for pre-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer. This is definitely something to keep an eye on for all those bullish on the biopharma space!\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSo, here's the scoop for those who want to know what all the fuss is about. Atossa Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ATOS) is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on addressing significant unmet needs in oncology, particularly breast cancer. Their latest breakthrough involves the Phase 2 EVANGELINE study, which aims to develop a neoadjuvant treatment for pre-menopausal women with Grade 1 or 2 ER+ / HER2- breast cancer. This type of breast cancer affects a significant number of premenopausal women worldwide and requires an effective treatment option. Atossa's innovative Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), (Z)-endoxifen, combined with exemestane and goserelin, shows promising potential in enhancing the antitumor mechanism of action and inhibiting PKC\u03b21, a known oncogenic protein. If successful, this study could pave the way for improved treatment options for pre-menopausal breast cancer patients.\n\n**Highlighted Main Points:**\n\n* Atossa Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ATOS) has fully enrolled the pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in cohort for their Phase 2 EVANGELINE study, focusing on pre-menopausal women with ER+ / HER2- breast cancer.\n* The study aims to determine the optimal dose of Atossa's patented SERM, (Z)-endoxifen, combined with exemestane and goserelin as a neoadjuvant treatment for this patient population.\n* By targeting PKC\u03b21 inhibition and enhancing (Z)-endoxifen's antitumor mechanism of action, the study seeks to provide a more effective treatment option for pre-menopausal breast cancer patients.\n\n(P.S This is not financial advice)",

    "postText": "Takeover is in play. \n\nLast night TALS filed (https://ir.talaristx.com/node/7756/html) that they terminated 95% of their workforce effective April 28. Employees have been given 2 weeks notice and will receive full severance payout. The CEO and Chief HR have been given 6 weeks notice and it will all be wrapped up by May 26. The CFO has been given a 6mo bonus retainer to stay until the takeover is complete. The language in that document suggests it will be a reverse takeover by a private company.\n\nThey estimate aggregate severance costs at $8.7m, which leaves the company with around $170m in cash. The stock closed at $81m marketcap, so it\u2019s trading less than half the cash value.\n\nI highly doubt this team will allow any takeover to value the company below its cash value of $4/share. TALS chairman (bio (https://talaristx.com/team/francois-nader/)) sits on the board of $60B Moderna, is advisor to Blackstone Life Sciences (who owns 19% of TALS), was chair of Acceleron Pharma when it was sold to Merk for $11.5 billion in Sept 2021, was chair of Prevail Therapeutics when it was sold to Eli Lilly for $1 billion in Dec 2020. TALS CFO (bio (https://talaristx.com/team/mary-kay-fenton/)) was CFO of Semma Therapeutics when it was sold to Vertex for $950 million in Sept 2019.\n\nI\u2019m expecting the takeover to be announced any day.",

    "postText": "Am I missing something. Uvxy is so low. With all the uncertainty, how hasn't this thing been popping off? At a little over 2 bucks a share. Why would you not own 100 shares? At least as a hedge against holding voo or vti.\n\nWith credit card debt at an all-time high. Mortgages at an all-time high. Student loans are coming back into the mix. People are going to spend money to feed their family. So, which thing do you think they are gonna take off the list? Because realistically, most people can't afford a 2k  mortgage/rent, a maxed out credit card, utilities, student loans, and even groceries. Shit my groceries are at 1k a month for a family of 4. If they have to pay for daycare on top of that, sheesh. Good luck, economy.\n\nI'm curious to see what everyone else has to say. Considering the media says we just switched into a bull market. I'm not buying it. The only things performing are the top 10 companies. Everyone else is still and has been struggling. With the select few of course.\n\nEdit: punctuation",

What you want is for banks to STOP giving loans out. \n\nThe easy way to see this is when the consumer credit plateaus. Then you run into the awkward scenario. Do the banks do risky loans to stay afloat? Or do they do the responsible thing and deny loans?\n\n\nWell SVB, yellen, and the fed have answered the question - unlimited bail outs. So you can be bullish all the way UNTIL then. \n\n\nWhat will then happen is a varied number of elements that shock the system enough that the bubbles erupts. Bulls are right to be bullish right now, but bulls that ate absolutely comfortable on the bubble being maintained are going to be absolutely slaughtered.\n\n\nStocks keep going up until you give it enough reason to go back down.",

Im waiting for a week or two. Its been testing bottoms as opposed to reaching relative highs for a while in my amateur analysis. I would not buy any home improvement retail store with the housing market dipping. More money pouring into speculative tech. Just seems typical to see a bounce in a stock about to dip .

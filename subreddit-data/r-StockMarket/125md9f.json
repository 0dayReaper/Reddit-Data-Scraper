(Refer to the bill)\n\nI think this will have a serious market impact as a majority of companies will have no idea how to deal with this incompetence.\n\nIt would require rewriting things made by people who died decades ago; which is possible, but an incredibly trying task and not one many people are going to do on a government salary and not one pretty much any company is going to do willingly... which means companies pulling out of the usa or shutting down because they can't or won't abide by the new patriot act.\n\nI think the tech sector will get crippled by this and we basically enter a full on technodystopia where individuals will be unable to express ideas anonymously, therefore forcing everyone to abide the 'norms' whether they're correct or not, preventing any discussion from seeing other options forcing the market 'one way'. Public information is garbage as it is, we can't see effective swap data and most other 'high level' data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, if this bill passes and everyone's devices are connected to this dumb shit, I really can't wait for the hacker to turn the entire USA into a botnet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional sources and recommended reading (I'll add more sources later, I've a meeting to attend):\n\n[https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2023/01/17/demographic-crisis/](https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2023/01/17/demographic-crisis/)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2023/01/27/1151734308/immigration-economy-birth-rate-population](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/27/1151734308/immigration-economy-birth-rate-population)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a playlist of 4 detailed rundowns of crises happening in china currently (Demographic, housing, water, and soft power)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTbILK0fxDY&amp;list=PLR5tswn4SFyUOm3QusvlFGbPCCAN\\_uXnK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTbILK0fxDY&amp;list=PLR5tswn4SFyUOm3QusvlFGbPCCAN_uXnK)",

They love making show raids against unpopular industries, they did it against Microsoft in the late 1990's. Yet the French can't understand why they have a real unemployment rate of 35% and why well educated citizens have to leave for other EU nations, UK, USA, Canada, etc to find work. The French economy has become a museum for what the country used to be. Explains why so many striked, protested and rioted for the retirement age being raised from 62 to 64. Just like in the 1990's, nothing will be found from this so called investigation. Pathetic!",

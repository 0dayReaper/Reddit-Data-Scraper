    "postText": "In the two years since U.S. inflation soared, the Federal Reserve has made limited progress in curbing rising prices. A group of investors in the bond market believe that the Fed will not only finally beat inflation, but that long-term interest rates will return to low levels, as the Fed expects. this idea is held by Gene Tannuzzo, head of global fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. I think the Fed is slowly regaining credibility on the anti-inflation issue, and as inflation gets closer to target levels, long-term rates will once again become a reliable anchor for yields,\" he said. This view is not uncommon in the market.",

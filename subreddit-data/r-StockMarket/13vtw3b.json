    "postText": "(edit because holy shit melvins: I'm not a developer that creates AIs. I'm a developer that builds systems upon AIs)\n\n\nHello, good people of /r/stockmarket. I'm a software developer who has been closely watching the open source AI projects for years. My expertise is not in the construction of AIs but rather in the softwares that surround them. I've built systems utilizing various AIs (both local and SaaS) and the tools built for them (e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vector Databases, etc).\n\nI just wanted to give you guys a heads up that I'm seeing a lot of people in here making very strong claims about AI while also demonstrating a very surface level understanding of what's going on.\n\nI'm here to answer any questions you have. I don't claim expertise in valuations or anything like that. But the magnitude and breadth of what's going on here is being significantly misunderstood.\n\nSo, I'm here to cut down on the hearsay. What do you want to know?\n\ndisclaimer: I don't own any stock whatsoever.\n\n---\n\nedit: /u/7366241494 and I had a pretty enlightening conversation regarding the supplier of NVIDIA's superconductors [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13vtw3b/theres_a_lot_of_bad_information_about_ai_in_here/jm9fgqh/?context=11). I think they provided a very valuable insight.\n\nedit 2: If you're well-versed in the field, you can either expend your energy trying to prove me for the fraud that you without a doubt know I am after reading 5 sentences of what I wrote. OR you can provide information about the field that you know better than I do. I suggest the latter. No one else here cares if you nor I are \"super duper smart\". I'm tired of wasting time on no-shit sherlocks.",

Nowadays **transformers** beat everything most of the time, and usually transformers is a different architecture from RNNs.\n\nI say mostly because RNNs are still at the top for some LM tasks (typically character-level) and there are works that combine the two - being both RNNs and transformers at the same time; those are mostly just research still and not leading.\n\nThough when people talk about LLMs, they tend to refer to more specific available models - like GPT3, PALM, GPT-J, etc. These are all transformers and are not RNNs. It is also a rather small class of rather similar models vs all of the different types of models that people have developed and made it to leaderboards etc. There are some reasons for that.\n\nSo I think what you are curious about is the difference between a transformer and RNN, and why being language modeling would not imply being an RNN necessarily.\n\nSo first you are right that language models typically work by taking some text, feeding in parts of it, predicting a continuation, and then correcting itself vs the actual continuation.\n\nThis type of training is specifically called **self-supervised learning**, and is used by both RNNs and transformers.\n\nThis is not the case for all models though. E.g. BERT masks random words in a text and then predict with having access to both text coming before and after. Which also means you could do things like having a story with a start and end, and then fill in the middle; or suggest individual words to replace to improve a text. This is also considered a type of language modeling, even though it is not just predicting the next token.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is something that RNNs rather struggles with and part of the reason why BERT could be so powerful for segment and classification texts.\n\nThe intuition for this is that an RNN only processes one token at a time, outputs some memory, generates the next token, rinse and repeat. This makes it difficult for it to deal with far dependencies because if something at the beginning of the text is useful, it needs to keep track of that in its memory and keep copying it for every token in the text in the hopes that it will become useful at some point.\n\nTransformers rather work by processing and predicting everything at once - all the tokens get fed in in parallel; go through a number of layers; and then have outputs for all of the tokens. Instead of one token feeding into another, each token instead produces values associated with 'keys' (vectors), and each next token in the next layer picks what values to use based on query vectors being similar to key vectors. That way each token can choose to have its values being influenced by any other token.\n\nSo e.g. if the text somewhere mentions a dog named Dexter, it can create a vector about that, and another token that is curious about whether the text is about a pet can see that vector being similar, and take and use that name. The tokens inbetween need to know nothing about this.\n\nSo the architecture is rather different.\n\nModels like GPT however are called **decoder-only** and they are trained only to predict the next token, one at a time, and hence are also **autoregressive language models**, which they share with but still are not RNNs.\n\nHope you find that useful/interesting! I'm sure ChatGPT can condense it if you prefer :p",

I think humans will be less concerned with \"being the best\" at that point and that, as with all things, the people who want augmentations will get them. I'm thinking this will be... 50 years from now (?). Very rough guess, of course, but due to the exponential nature of all this, I think it will happen startlingly quickly (relatively speaking).",

I don't mean to speak with certainty but I do know that 90% of the comments I see about this technology are clearly made by people who know very little about what's going on behind the scenes.

I\u2019m also close with a top executive.\n\nDuring Covid, we experienced a volume increase and a massive employee shortage simultaneously. I quickly realized the implications and dangers of this and how AI could mitigate these issues. In fact, AI SHOULD become part of the equation. \n\nNaturally, I tried to express my concerns (given my fairly strong background in operations within this industry). Large players are prepared for the wave you mention. They have large sums of capital to invest and thus, a competitive advantage over smaller players. Once this wave arrives, it\u2019ll be too late.\n\nDuring tough economic environments, the name of the game is efficiency, in terms of managing capital and expenses. Businesses such as Amazon know this and are taking advantage of it.\n\nThey disagreed as to why AI/automation should become a priority for us. They\u2019re underestimating the situation, perhaps due to ignorance.\n\nI understand AI/automation is a capital extensive venture that takes time. We\u2019d need to restructure warehouse infrastructure to accommodate the hardware, re-engineer SOP\u2019s and probably bring a new software. There\u2019s also legal implications and elements that I\u2019m not well versed on. \n\nBut if we don\u2019t adapt, we\u2019ll get crushed. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a pessimist or implying that I\u2019m more knowledgeable than executives but I can see it coming from a mile away. My conviction is strong.\n\nNot sure what I\u2019m looking for here. It\u2019s concerning to say the least. Working on a presentation for an upcoming meeting in the next month. Doing some in depth research to better address my thoughts.\n\nWould appreciate any pointers or advice.",

It's not of direct consequence but in the age of information, dev work impacts a whole lot of things.\n\nAnd the financial market should be well aware of the impact of AI. As you probably are well aware: a majority of trading has been occurring by bots for a long time now. And they just gained the ability to actually understand English. They've gained the ability to use Google and Wolfram Alpha. I would recommend becoming familiar with what, exactly embeddings are and how powerful they can be.\n\nIf you have questions about any of this, feel free to reply to me here or send me a DM.",

Perhaps not the best phrasing, in retrospect, but I made it clear in the first few sentences \"I don't create AIs\". (and by \"AIs\", I really meant \"LLMs\"... I've created AIs, in the past, but it's not really what I do. I create systems that interface with LLMs through the use of context management via embeddings etc).\n\nLiterally, what?!  If I started the following Reddit thread:  \n\n\n**There's a \\*lot\\* of bad information about web dev in here at the moment. I'm a web developer. AMA about web**  \n\n\nThis clearly is me saying I'm a web developer.  I can't logically claim, \"I meant to say I'm actually a DBA that uses Google Chrome and the internet.\"  Stop walking it back, or, just change the thread title? You meant to claim you built AI, you didn't think people that actually do this for a living are in the sub(Hello, I'm one of them \\*wave\\*) and you got steamrolled for it.",

I seem to be able to do this on my local machine relatively easily\n\nThis seems to be our point of departure on the topic. I agree that there will be a pullback after the researchers and startups are done having their go. But in order to run models with generalized intelligence (which is really what has been missing from a lot of APIs: common sense), you'll need some hardware if you want privacy. And privacy won't matter to a lot of companies but, IMO, it'll matter to a lot of companies.\n\nYou also have to consider fixed vs variable costs with regard to context management and just general usage. The reason I got into locally hosted AIs in the first place is because I can run unlimited queries against them without incurring a cost per 4k letters. And that's ignoring opportunities at fine tuning, pipelines, general control of the overall system... I think there's a lot of upside to running your LLM locally hosted.\n\nBut yea, I think it'll follow a similar model to AWS *eventually*. But in the short term: open-source models are passing up closed source models (as the leaked memo from Google indicates). I think if it's a choice of \"pay per letter or pay upfront\", medium sized companies will generally select \"pay upfront\".\n\nI run a company that provides QA for a certain service. They employ an entire call center to do what I could reproduce using [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JavaFXpert/Chat-GPT-LangChain) rather quickly. I have *years* of QA data that I can train an AI on.",

I was working with tensorflow and pytorch but now most of my work is related to \"how do you take a gigabyte of docs and create a system that can speak intelligently about it\". This behavior is possible today but it's tricky. In terms of finance, I'd say take its capacity to laterally think (perhaps its strongest suit) and apply it to finance. Use  AutoGPT to find information relevant to potential stock picks. Or use it to generate that list of picks. This requires a bit of programming but nothing crazy abstract like polymorphism. If you have a cursory knowledge of python, you should be able to stitch something together. Search for opensource projects (tip: search google with `site:github.com` at the end). At this point, its greatest benefit to me is giving it a data dump of specialized knowledge and asking it to connect the dots.",

They would rent out the hardware to run the AI. I mean, sure, they'll offer a turn-key solution to those without a developer. But that'll again just be the software pre-installed on some hardware. That hardware is a GPU. The demand for GPUs is about to increase dramatically because a new very powerful tool has come out that requires one (whereas in the past, they were relegated to specialized use cases). I feel like there's really no way around that fact.",

They set up vector databases for embeddings and utilize specific AIs that are specialized in various tasks to create components of a larger system that's been piped together. They create a system that intelligently finds the elements of the prompt that are necessary for an informed query. This is where you leverage a lot more power per VRAM GB than what you can get out of something that's more generalized (like chatgpt). And how you handle the long-term memory problem that systems like chatgpt have (it also makes them much less likely to hallucinate).",

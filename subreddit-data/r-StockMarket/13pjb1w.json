As much as the natives were treated poorly, they have also been treated exceptionally well by historical standards \n\nMajor leader in the expansion of women\u2019s rights \n\nMajor leader in the expansion of gay rights\n\nMajor leader in the expansion of trans rights\n\nMost responsible for the suppression of horrific ideologies like fascism and communism \n\nLeads the world in innovation that makes all our lives safer and more prosperous \n\nAnd many many more \n\nHonestly the list is too expansive to put here.\n\nSince WW2, the US is almost solely responsible for the level of peace, prosperity, and human rights we have achieved worldwide.\n\nThe facts are that the very ideas of modern human and individual rights that we judge the US so harshly for not living up to exist because of the West led by the US, UK, and France. Especially in the last century the US is far and away the most responsible country for the the prosperity 7 billion people enjoy worldwide. Yes, critique, we can do better, but there has never been a country that has done more good for more people than the USA. The US is among the least deserving of criticism.",

So I will tel you what I know and you go find the sources\n\n1. The foundations of modern human rights is widely considered the Magna Carta. Which predates your fucking country by like half a millenium. You also have the English Bill of Rights in about the 1600's and the French 1700's. So to think the US is domininant in it is fuckign ludicrous. Plus, it was the Allies in WW2 that started using the term human rights and it was NEW ZEALAND that was the most vocal proponent of putting human rights as the cornerstone of the UN charter\n2. Nope, Major europeans banned slavery a hundred years before you guys decided to have a civil war to sort the issue. AND you didnt abolish it anywhere else unlike a number of European Powers that enforced the ending of slavery on other nations\n3. nope. Did not give rights to the people you conquered. You literally used treaties and lies to disposes them because they had no rights and didnt get them until the 1900's.\n4. nope, wasnt even near the first few to pass womans sufferage\n5. what gay rights did the US advance? And when?\n6. Trans rights. LOL.\n7. supported both ideologies until they threatened US power and is responsible for putting in place a litany of dictators that caused genocides in the name of oppressing peoples self determination because you know whats best for them.\n8. About the only thing on this list that is semicorrect. Yeah, you once were the world leaders in innovation. You aint anymore. You cant languish in the bottom half of education and think you'll remain leading innovators. I mean, youre still the richest country, so you pay foreigners to come innovate at your companies.

Putting limits on the monarch is not the same as codifying rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The English Bill of Rights also lacked Religious freedom. This makes them both inferior to the American system.\n\n2.) Europeans were the ones who took the slaves out of Africa and shipped them across the Atlantic Ocean for sale. No American ever participated in that practice. Americans were the ones that put an end to the import of slaves from European merchants.\n\n3.) The Indigenous were not conquered outright. The Americans made great effort to trade with them, and much of the violence that happened was due to the Indigenous being unhappy with the results of said trade. For instance, The Great Sioux War of 1876 happened because the Indigenous were unhappy that they didn't get an expansion on their credit due to maxing out their credit, and so they killed and kidnapped unarmed civilians.\n\n4.) He never claimed that they were the first to pass women's suffrage, he said that they were a major player in the advancement of women's rights, which is true. Your response is an attack on a straw-man. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_legal_rights_in_the_United_States_(other_than_voting)\n\n5.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States#Summary_table_of_LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States\n\n6.) You got me here. I'm not sure what Trans Rights are supposed to be.\n\n7.) I disagree with you both. The U.S. is fascist in the traditional sense of the word, i.e. a form of socialism based on unions and corporations. Today we call it a \"mixed economy\".\n\n8.)

You don't just take your ball and go home at the expense of the global economy bc you're still mad about previous elections. Notice how whenever republicans are in office the debt still doesn't go down? even when they hold both chambers and the presidency? Yeah me either. But they act high and mighty when they hold just the house as if they weren't part of the problem for 40 years knowing they can simply point the finger at democrats after tanking the economy knowing their voters are either not informed enough or just don't care. This entire scenario is not done in good faith. The notion that republicans are the party of \"fiscal responsibility\" is a farce and just simply put, good political branding since Regan.

                    "comment": "I think I it's funny that during the post-WWII 1950's, that (white) Boomers refer to as \"the Golden Age of America, the top Federal tax rate was 91% on incomes over $400,000. (The last year of this rate was 1963- $400,000 then is the equivalent of $3.965 million today). 91%! Can you imagine?\n\nHere's a list of the top tax rates and income figures on that throughout the years. I\"m providing the first year the rates went into effect:\n\n* 1964: 77% on $400K ($3.965 million in 2023)\n\n* 1965: 70% on $200K ($1.926 million in 2023)\n\n* 1982: 50% on $85,600 ($269,000 in 2023)- this was the start of Ronald Reagan's \"trickle down economics\" (what George H.W. Bush disparagingly referred to as \"voodoo economics\")\n\n* 1984- 50.0% on $164,000 ($474,000 in 2023)- you see the trick here: the top rate stayed the same but the income needed to hit that rate doubled. The same $85,600 that started a 50% tax hit in 1982 was now a 45% rate.\n\n* 1987- 38.5% on $90,000 ($240,340 in 2023): another huge cut. Ronald Reagan cut the top tax rate in this country try nearly in half while he was in office.\n\n*1988- 28.0% on $29,750 ($76,300 in 2023). True insanity. In 1988-1990 there were two, TWO, income tax brackets in this country. Any income over $0 was taxed at 15% and anything over $29-32K (they played with different rates in the three years) was taxed at 28.0%. The middle-class was taxed at the exact same rate as millionaires. It was almost a \"flat tax\". How well did it work?\n\n*1991- 31.0% on $86,500 ($193K in 2023). It worked so well that the aforementioned George H.W. Bush, who said during the 1988 Presidential campaign \"read my lips..no new taxes!\" realized it really was \"voodoo economics\", and raised taxes on the rich. Yes. A Republican President raised taxes on the rich...and destroyed his own re-election chances in the process, for the good of the faltering U.S. economy.\n\n* 1993- 39.6% on $250,000 ($525K in 2023) as well as 36% on $140,000 ($294K in 2023). These new tax brackets on the rich both helped pull the U.S. out of a recession...and got the Democrats slaughtered in the 1994 Congressional elections. However....\n\n*2000- 39 6% on $288,350 ($498K in 2023)- Those brackets didn't move one iota during Clinton's time in office. And what did we have in 2000? A balanced budget and a SURPLUS that was paying down the debt. For everyone screaming about deficits and debts, Slick Willie already showed you the path: raise taxes on the wealthy!\n\n* Post 2003: top rate ranges from 35.0% to 39.6%. Our tax rates and brackets have stayed relatively level since the GWB administration.\n\nLooking back at history, the President who did the most to lower taxes in this country, and start a chain reaction that led to the economic peril we're in today regarding debt and deficits is, hands-down, Ronald Reagan.",

The ceiling gives Congress again some final say over the treasury...but it's a circle jerk. Congress wrote the laws, passed the budgets, so has to pay the bill. Any government spending arguments should have been made/answered either at the point the law was written or in budget negotiations.

It's because the private sector responded by taking on debt themselves. I've seen a Times edition from the 90s where on one page there was an article with a graph about how great it was that the national debt was receding, and on the page just opposite there was an article with accompanying graph discussing a worrying rise in private debt issuance. It was right there for everyone to see, but few people put it together. Ultimately, the private sector cannot keep taking on debt forever; it needs to pay it back or default. That leads to deflation and insolvency respectively. And lo and behold, when the bubble popped at the turn of the millennia, a lot of wealth was wiped out and we went into recession. But again we didn't get deflation. Why? Because Bush was in office, and he pushed through a huge tax cut and giant increases in spending for two wars. So the government, in failing to run deficits, created the conditions for a credit crisis that would ultimately force it to run more extreme deficits down the road to compensate. And our nation ends up poorer in real terms than if we had just spent more in the 90's on good public investments.",

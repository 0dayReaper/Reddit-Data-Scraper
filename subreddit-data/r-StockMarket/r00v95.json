Breaking that could lead you directly to $130 for a gap fill (technical analysis is about probability, not certainty) so in my point of view the probably of PayPal going down is far higher than I\u2019m going up, in terms of TA.\n\nI was planning to buy PYPL but decided to wait for $175. However, it\u2019s almost oversold on all timescales (except for monthly) so we might see a leg up soon to reset the RSI.\n\nJust my take on PYPL, not advice :P.",

A 3x fund may or may not always return 3x the gain or loss, depending on the specifics of the fund. As others have said, be very careful and make sure you understand the risks before buying. A lot of people recommending these things have never lived through a bear market. Just my .02.",

Chewy is the only place that has a variety of options always available. Grocery stores have very limited variety in comparison. Brick and mortar stores sell some of the same but it costs more than ordering from Chewy. The facebook page for Chewy is 1.6 million strong and none of their competitors come close. Amazon even took notice of Chewy grabbing so much market share that they started Amazon pets and have now seemed to abandon the project. Their web traffic has continued to increase. Chewy is now also becoming the go-to place for vets to send prescriptions to.",

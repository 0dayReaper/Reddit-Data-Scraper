Today I take the Jeep in for service and expect the bill to be upwards of $2500 just for exhaust work.  Only service the EV needed in 2 years was tires. They don't work for everything but EVs sure seem cheaper overall.",

If I didn't have a small boat I would have sold it a few years ago. I live in a townhouse and just use the public charging stations. Ours is a Nissan Leaf and it is perfect for the wife as a run about. Bought it used and had no issues, surprisingly the trunk has more space than my Cherokee. I wouldn't have a specific recommendation, my wife has the leaf, several people I know have Teslas and one the small BMW. All of them are solid. Personally I will probably get a new Toyota EV when they have a SUV version for a couple years. (Difference from the dealer and the normal shop where I am is only about 15% cheaper. Biggest issue is the parts cost which Mopar is excessive, at least for anything 2015 and newer.)",

I have been creating spreadsheets and no matter how I slice it, the upfront cost of having an EV has not really made sense for the fuel savings. Sure maintenance cost is being reduced, but that goes right out the window with a higher loan for an EV\u2026 \n\nLooking at the 7500 tax credit. \n\nBut maybe will just go with a used Honda accord.",

Only advantage at the higher price is it set the monthly costs and maintenance lower. Can't go wrong with a good Honda Accord though. One additional thing to consider is your insurance is higher with an EV as they are assumed to be a write off in an accident. One of those good to know things. TBH, I may dump my 2015 jeep and go for an older one or just sell it and the boat so I don't need to tow. It would be cheaper to rent than have more vehicle than I actually need.",

    "postText": "Generally speaking, if a company earns more than its expected earnings, but its gross profit declines, will the stock go up or down?\nI don't have the exact numbers but I am pretty sure that because many of its items are on sale then it will sell more but for a lower price.\nI know the question may be very vague and the answer may vary on the situation but I am asking it in general.\n\nOn the one hand, net income goes up, but on the other hand, people may view the large discount on items as a bad thing and may foresee future decline in earnings.\n\nThanks in advance",

So in theory they should go up. \n\nBut people rarely trade like that. Just look at Nvidia for example.",

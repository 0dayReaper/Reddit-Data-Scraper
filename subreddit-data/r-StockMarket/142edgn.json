SEC suits go nowhere.\n\n  \nIt's natural to see recent SEC lawsuits as a chance to buy stocks at a good price, but it's important to be cautious and consider various factors. Although some SEC cases may have limited impact, it's essential to keep in mind that regulatory actions can still have significant consequences for both companies and investors.",

Household debt is at an all time high. So many bad investments are made when money is so cheap. It creates massive inefficiencies in the economy due to all the zombie companies and inefficient businesses that wouldn't exist otherwise. Eventually once interest rates return to \"normal\", as they inevitably will at some point, all the people default on their debts and all these businesses go bankrupt along with all the jobs associated with them. Aka. a boom/bust economy. Central banks were created for the purpose of stabilizing the economy, not to prop up the economy in perpetuity. \n\nWe will eventually be in a situation where central banks will have to make a choice: Sacrifice the economy in order to preserve the value of the dollar or sacrifice the dollar in order to preserve the economy. Which one do you think they will do? It will not surprise me to see central banks justify mid to high single digit inflation rates as the \"new normal\" over the coming years as they continue to inject the economy with new cash via quantitative easing. Those who have the means will seek riskier and riskier investments in order to get a real positive return. Those who don't will rely more and more on government welfare which will put further pressure on central banks to do QE to make up the difference on even larger government deficits. This will continue until it all eventually implodes catastrophically.",

Then, in March 2022, prices were 108.5. So the YoY inflation in March 2022 was 8.5%.\n\nFinally, in July 2022, prices were also 108.5.

Well it's because the period from March 2021 to July 2021 also had 0 inflation.\n\nAnd this is why looking at two YoY numbers within the same year to get a sense of inflation between them is silly. It requires you to look at 3 separate numbers to make sense of it, the two YoY numbers, and the change between the prices in the base year.\n\nSo instead of doing all of that, just look at the price changes between the two months. Much easier to make sense of that.",

I don't understand why people don't get this.\n\nThe 8.5 number is totally irrelevant. It's backwards looking and is something that has already happened. If inflation this month was -1% we would still have 7.5% YoY inflation. Would you still think -1% was high inflation??",

We had zero or even negative month over month inflation jumps in 2021. And yet here we are 1 year later. Even Powell said in 2021 that inflation is \"transitory\" back then to save his ass. Same thing is happening now where people are declaring inflation is done for.\n\nMy point being having a temporary lull in inflation means nothing. It has no bearing on how things will be 6 months or 1 year later. If that was the case, all the things we said in 2021 about inflation would be true and we wouldn't be in a bear market in 2022.\n\nIt's like saying S&amp;P rallied in July so we are in a bull market now or it's highly likely that bear market is over. \n\nHave we really become this dense in this subreddit? 1-2 datapoints from the past don't tell much about the future. Only the future can tell the future.",

In case it's the latter,  my position is based on a dynamic approach to market conditions. It's almost like enhanced DCA but keeps allocations in risky assets or cash depending on market drawdowns or volatility. The central idea is to not be overly exposed in uncertain times and revert to risky allocation in more certain times. This works well with some leverage. And there are plenty of signals that give some idea of current uncertainty. And uncertainty tends to linger, not disappear overnight.\n\nI try to stick to not predicting things. I've worked at some very good places in Wall street and some of our best people had their predictions put to shame. Over the long term, good principles win over predictions. It's fine to speculate with a small percentage of your portfolio for fun &amp; learning, but your major allocation has to be principle based, not based on pundits, trends or extrapolating data points. That involves becoming good at managing uncertainty, risk and allocation.",

Yet here were in 2022, fucked by inflation and in a bear market. By your logic, your head would still be hurting back then lol.\n\nIn March 2022, markets rallied. Everyone went back into markets and got fucked again.\n\nSame thing is happening with July 2022.\n\n1-2 data points from the past say nothing about the future. In fact it can lead to complacency or outright stupidity. What's happened over last 2-3 months say nothing about 2023. If that was the case, what we said in 2021 would be true for 2022 (even Powell thought otherwise) and that simply isn't the case.\n\nThe truth is almost no one really understands the true causes behind inflation. Some think they do. And everyone has their pet theories. Those causes may dictate longer term inflation for many years or it could be over soon. Only time will tell. Certainly couple months of data, good or bad, means nothing.",

Food, metals, lumber, oil  etc. definitely arent used in anything that is calculated in inflation measures.\n\nAlso, the causes of inflation are fairly clear, it's the weighting each cause has that is typically in contention. Many of those causes are getting less intense, such as supply chain issues and the peak oil demand portion of the year.\n\nAlso as it happens, speculation caused a decent bit of it too. I traded a little in the wheat commodities earlier this year. There were days when the open orders to purchase deliverable wheat contracts exceeded the total yearly production for the entire US. When something that is heavily speculated on starts to roll over, it dumps hard, because most of the buyers don't actually want the product.",

That is the question!\n\nI dont trust the experts either. I do this full time now and spend quite a bit of time researching on my own, and listen to cnbc during market hours. Everyone has their own bias and agenda, but the data doesn't. You mix enough of what you read/hear with the data and you can kind of form you own opinions.\n\nFor what it's worth, even the mega banks are often wrong, and the opinions in the bank are often very different and contrarian to each other.\n\n\nI see commodities down massively and spending slowing from consumers. I see walmart and target slashing prices due yo excess inventory. I see ukraine starting to really turn the tides in the war. Oil will absolutely nosedive when that happens, even if it shouldn't- just because that is what is expected. \n\nIdk what happens in a few months or next year. But the next 60 days look good to me. I do expect a pullback to maybe 4k soon, but then more uptrend.  I could be wrong for sure, but my strategy is ok with that. I'm mostly long with shares, have about 15% cash and will hedge aggressively if the market starts to roll over",

Those really big resistances can act more like rubber bands rather than hard resistance. Meaning you can pass them for a bit and then get the delayed rejection.

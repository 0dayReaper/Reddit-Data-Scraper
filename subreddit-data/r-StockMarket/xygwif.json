I would probably be down less if I were risk adverse but I'm not. \n\nWhen your young you have time on your side. In the history of the market (S&amp;P, DOW, etc) the markets make money. You have to be patient. Think long term. If they are solid companies their stock prices will recover. \n\nIn 2008 when the Banking and Housing crash happened I lost over 50% but I just road it out. It took time to recover.\n\nThe older you get you have to be more conservative with your investment strategy so you don't lose it and no time to make it up. \n\nIgnore the constant bad news. Think about your risk tolerance and invest in those areas based on that risk tolerance. \n\nThere is no such thing as a get rich quick scenario. Sometimes people get lucky but very few do. Again, Play the long game. And don't invest money you don't have! Never borrow money invest.",

Americans typically blow money in the 4th quarter which won\u2019t be helping out the CPI. With such a strong labor market, more people are able to spend more money on less available goods which adds to the inflation problem. Lastly, you\u2019ll likely be able to see or feel the inflation situation ease before the cpi confirms your feelings since the cpi is a trailing indicator. Once a few prints of the cpi start to trend down and the fed lifts their boot off the neck of interest rates, then the markets can start to react more positively. Until then, hold on to your seat, it\u2019s going to be a choppy ride.",

Probably. Are there going to be more stupid bull rallies that make us the think this is the turn? Probably. When the FED says they may pause that\u2019s the time to start buying some favorites. When the Fed says they are going to lower interest rates then you can buy with free reign. It\u2019s not rocket science but it is mostly true. Stocks do go up, long term.

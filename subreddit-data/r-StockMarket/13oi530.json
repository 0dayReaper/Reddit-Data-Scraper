I remember there was some ASIC miner floating around a while back that was 7nm built in china.  But that\u2019s not as important, yield and cost is.  The whole reason EUV is so amazing is that it reduces cost.  It is not required to make these leading edge chips, but it reduces cost compared to older lithography machines making lower nm production more viable financially.\n\nEven making smaller nm chips is all about cost savings.  You can still make and run all the newest tech on older production sizes, you would just have a huge chip that uses a lot of power and has a lot of heat to deal with, high cost to operate.  They can still make AI it will just cost them more.",

You are always 10 yrs ahead of your competitor . \n\nAnd if your whole economy or business model is based on copying and IP theft with no original idea, that is a problem \n\nIf you are plunging billions of free money into your country just to outcompete your competitors, it usually lead to mismanagement , corruption , lack of new ideas , and overall , there will be nothing to show for .",

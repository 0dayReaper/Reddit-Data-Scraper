Blackrock doesn\u2019t own these shares anymore than Robinhood owns the shares someone buys through their platform. It happens that Blackrock and Vanguard are two of the most consistent and reliable platforms with the lowest expense ratios, so people tend to use them, which leads to them having a lot of AUM. Blackrock is in fact a publicly traded company with a market cap of $100 billion, Elon could buy it with half his net worth, or Apple with half their cash. What a crazy infinite money hack - you can buy a company that owns the whole $35 trillion market for only $100 billion! What a steal.",

I\u2019ve seen this chart posted like 8 times on Reddit with people promoting socialism and communism in the comments complaining about how \u201ccapitalism doesn\u2019t lead to creativity it leads to monopolization\u201d. But in a communist society you\u2019d most likely have 1 fucking entity providing the entire country its food. \n\nWorst of all they picked the absolute worst industry to show monopolization in capitalistic countries. Canada has like 3 telecom companies and 6 banks that are consistently kept in their little monopoly by the government. There are 3 credit rating agencies for basically the entire global economy. There are 4 firms that audit effectively the entire Fortune 500 list. There are 5 tech companies that dominate the majority of the western market. And here they are choosing an industry where there are thousands of medium sized to small sized players. Consumer packaged goods is probably one of the most friendly industries to small businesses.\n\nThis is almost as bad as a thread I saw online a few days ago of someone claiming that Blackrock owns \u201c90% of the economy\u201d and it showed a list of all the companies that they have a stake in insinuating that because they have a 3% ownership in Walmart, that means they own the entire business. \n\nEdit: I just checked and there\u2019s people below saying that Blackrock and Vanguard \u201cown 99% of the economy\u201d or some Bs somewhere in this thread. And this is on a stock market subreddit God help us lmao",

And another one of those years their income was only $350 million. So they\u2019ve only really met expectations 6/10 times.\n\nI'm on about how their profit margin was 8.9% most recently, having rebounded from far lower post-pandemic. They're not \"going under\" anytime soon because you're needlessly attached to outdated data.\n\nAnd why would a net income figure like $350M matter in a conversation you started about *margin*? You started out by saying \"Most of their margins are razor thin. Kraft Heinz can barely turn a profit\", which is blatantly false, as they have an 8.9% net margin in their most recent year. You're flat out wrong and you're not forming a coherent train of thought, just mentioning whatever you can no matter how little it supports your contention.\n\nWhat are you on about? Because as far as I can tell it's nonsensical.\n\n&gt;Debt to revenue is a meaningless statistic for a company with wildly swinging incomes like this. They have to borrow $2 to make $1 in revenue and they still have the potential to post a net loss?\n\nNo it isn't, it's *always relevant* since net income is calculated after interest and amortization costs are paid. Net income to debt ratio makes no sense no matter how you slice it. Their revenue constitutes their ability to pay down their debts. \n\nAlso, you're wrong. [Kraft Heinz has total debt of $19.8B and a BBB credit rating from Fitch, investment grade.](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-kraft-heinz-proposed-sr-unsecured-notes-bbb-05-05-2023#:~:text=Kraft%20ended%202022%20with%20net,balances%20of%20around%20%241%20billion.)\n\n&gt; How is $43 billion in debt rolling over at higher interest rates not problematic for a company with dwindling profits? I\u2019m not sure I see what you\u2019re getting at.\n\nThey're not dwindling considering both revenue and net income have grown over the past 4 years. But you certainly don't, no matter how simply I explain it. I can't explain it any simpler.",

This is as simply as I can put it, your contentions that their margins are razor thin and they may go under in 10 years make little sense.",

Their margins aren't \"razor thin\" at 8.9% and they're not in danger of insolvency when their debt to EBITDA rating is declining and they've maintained an investment grade credit rating.

    "postText": " \n\nTesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company\u2019s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.\n\nTesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla\u2019s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.\n\nGM\u2019s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=422001089495eb16437a3f761264447a1936ba4e\n\nNonetheless, it hasn\u2019t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck\u2019s capabilities.\n\nPreproduction \u201calpha\u201d versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still \u201castounded\u201d that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.",

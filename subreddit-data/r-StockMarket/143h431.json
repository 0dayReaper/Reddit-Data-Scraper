They do absorb all trades by taking the opposite.\n\nIf you buy, they short; and if you sell, they long.\n\nThis means that any given time the market is mostly bullish and they are mostly short; etc.\n\nThat's why price corrects the way it does, usually to levels where the market makers break even.\n\n  \nIt's all about buying power. No one has infinite buying power.",

For learning how to pick a new stock company I recommend to read some books on this subject (as an engineer female I need to understand and 'feed' my overthinking functional mode), will help you how to identify companies on growth and the good investments for your needs, when is the best moment to buy the stocks there (yesterday, or today), how to interpret the financial reports, what to look, not focus only in the numbers and reports but in the growth and long term strategy of the company etc.  I don't understand all the terms but I learn to buy with brain not with emotions.\n\nAnd take time to listen the JLCollins youtube video with yoga for stock market. It is priceless :)",

They are not bearer bonds so if they are not titled in your name then you must present all the legal documents like death certificate, short certificate, the will naming you the beneficiary etc. I would advise going to a broker to help you. You can then have the stock certificates reissued in your name for a fee. If you deposit them into a brokerage account it will recalculate the splits and can add any accumulated dividends that the holding company have for that certificate. Then you can sell any or all shares, put in a stop loss or limit order to protect gains. If the certificate was worthless, like so many old ones are, they make a great framed reminder of your family as well as how risky the stock market is. Perfect to display in your home or office.",

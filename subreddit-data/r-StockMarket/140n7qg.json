    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m a 21m, and I was looking for any groups to talk about the market. I often find that large sub-Reddits will often offer lousy advice. \n\nI\u2019m not a day trader, but I posted one of my current portfolio returns. I couldn\u2019t post my all-time return without posting my positions, but it\u2019s up by +94%. \n\nI know this is meaningless or a small amount of wealth/evidence to many of you, but I hope it could potentially serve as evidence of someone that could be a good person to bounce ideas off of. \n\nMy DMs are open if you\u2019d like to talk or ask questions. \n\nP.S. As I said, I posted my earnings as evidence. I didn\u2019t mean to brag. In the grand scheme of things, I haven\u2019t achieved anything really.",

The competition will be less than ever before because the cost to build up the infrastructure to ship everything cheaply and quickly is massive compared to buying a store and have people shop there.",

While I was there they suddenly told us to stop putting any dvd/blu-rays into those protective \"crab-case\". It took a while to get a straight answer but they eventually admitted that it was cheaper to let them get stolen rather than pay the payroll to protect them or deal with the lost sales of people that didn't want to deal with it.\n\nYou might see a surge in things spider wrapped but Target isn't willing to pay enough people $15/hrs to unlock every for each of their hundreds of customers.",

This article sums up the problem of worrying about some faceless corporation that doesn't need financial assistance to exist. The people do, if we ignore the root of the problem, the problem only gets worse. Raising the standard of living if the population through simple policies like a indexing minimum wage to the inflation index, offering universal healthcare or at least a public option, as well as price caps on housing, we can help solve the root of the problem and not shed tears for a corporation that can't even keep it's employment retention rate at a point that isn't a fucking joke.",

I think risk management has already done the math and found that the online shoppers are consistently profitable in that you don\u2019t have to worry about theft and employee assault. If someone makes too many returns then you begin charging a restocking fee. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is the reason big box stores refused to put locations in certain areas for the longest time.",

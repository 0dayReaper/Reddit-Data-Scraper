    "postText": "House Democrats introduced a long-awaited bill on Tuesday that seeks to ban members of Congress, federal judges, Supreme Court justices, the president and others from trading stocks, in an attempt to crack down on conflicts of interest throughout the government.\n\nThe 26-page bill, titled the Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, would ban a slew of government officials from trading or owning investments in securities, commodities, futures, cryptocurrency or other digital assets.\n\nThose covered by the legislation include members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children, senior congressional staffers, the president, the vice president, political appointees, judicial officers \u2014 including Supreme Court justices and various judges \u2014 members of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s Board of Governors and the president or vice president of a Federal Reserve bank.\n\nIndividuals subject to the ban would be required to divest their holdings or place them into a qualified blind trust.\n\nThe measure, however, does not pertain to investments in diversified mutual funds, U.S. Treasury bills, state or municipal government bills, notes or bonds and investment funds held as part of a federal, state or local government employee retirement plan, among other types of widely held, diversified and publicly traded investment funds.\n\nThe House Administration Committee released the text of the bill months after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in February directed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, to draft a bill.\n\nThe push to ban lawmakers from trading stocks has gained steam on Capitol Hill amid reports that members have violated laws meant to prevent conflicts of interests involving financial transactions.\n\nIn September, The New York Times published an extensive report that said 97 lawmakers or their family members traded financial assets in the past three years that could be conflicts of interest.\n\nPelosi \u2014 whose husband, Paul Pelosi, is a venture capitalist \u2014 was at first against the idea of a ban on lawmaker stock trading, but ultimately endorsed the push in February. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers put the topic back in the news earlier this month when it penned a letter to leadership asking for a vote on a bill reforming lawmaker stock trading.\n\nEarlier this month, Pelosi said such a bill would likely come to the floor this month.\n\nBut time is running out.\n\nThe House reconvenes on Wednesday for the final three days of legislative business before the midterm elections. House lawmakers are scheduled to leave Washington on Friday and are not slated to return until after November.\n\nEven if there is enough time to bring the bill to the floor, it is unclear that it has the votes to pass.\n\nPunchbowl News reported earlier on Tuesday that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who sets the schedule in the lower chamber, has expressed opposition to the ban on lawmaker stock trading.\n\nHis spokesperson, however, told the outlet that Hoyer has \u201cnot seen final legislation, and will reserve his official decision until that time.\u201d\n\nA group of senators have been working on separate legislation to ban lawmaker stock trading.\n\nThe bill introduced on Tuesday also increases penalties for violating the provisions or the measure.\n\nCovered individuals who violate trading or ownership restrictions would be subject to a $1,000 fine. If the violation continues for more than 30 days, they would be subject to an additional $1,000 fine plus \u201can amount equal to 10 percent of the value of the covered investment that is the subject of violation at the beginning of the additional 30-day period of a continuing violation.\u201d\n\n[https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3664219-democrats-introduce-bill-banning-lawmakers-judges-from-trading-stocks/](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3664219-democrats-introduce-bill-banning-lawmakers-judges-from-trading-stocks/)\n\nThe House Democrats has drafted the long-awaited bill that seeks to ban any politician and relatives from trading stocks titled Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act.

This implies that the fine is for accidental trades and intentional will be fined much higher.\n\nI'd much rather they make a step in the right direction with this than do nothing. Then once this is accepted make another step and another as that's how change happens.",

Not necessarily. It's just that you have to be careful. If your dad is the son of a politician, does that mean you're fucked if you want to go on to a Wall Street career? If you father is impacted, why aren't you? You could get the same news he did just as fast.\n\nWhen does it stop? What if you're a cousin? What if you're married to a politicians child?\n\nSeems like a really tangled web that will have plenty of loopholes and entanglement issues.\n\nAt first glance it would seem you could circumvent this with a foreign trust.",

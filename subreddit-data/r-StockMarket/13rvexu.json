It depends on how fast the scientists move forward in developing those artificial systems such that they increase productivity first by assisting people, then by partially/entirely replacing them.\n\nIf you want to understand the roadmap a bit better, watch the latest, long [interview with Geoffrey Hinton](https://youtu.be/qpoRO378qRY) and read an article by Stephen Wolfram [What is ChatGPT doing?](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/), which is pretty long - some 18k words - but ticking all the boxes without being math heavy and explaining all fundamentals of NNs and LLMs.\n\nNvidia may keep growing exponentially because those systems are hungry of computing power. It won't surprise me if Nvidia dethrones Apple in less than a decade. It may be that the current price of \\~$400 per share will look super cheap from that perspective.\n\nBy the way, it will become apparent, after reading Wolfram's article, that there is very little, if any, \"AI\" in ChatGPT in particular, and in the field of AI research in general. But the field moves faster, than expected, so who knows, what we'll have in a few decades.",

The video kinda gave me same vibes like Linus video in 2017 - I still remember the episode where he was very excited about AMD Ryzen processor and said he'll buy AMD stock because of this. And I stupid looked at the price and thought, damn, but AMD so expensive at 11$ such price was only during 2000 bubble.\n\nBut yea, it's all bs about \"what if\", should just focus on my portfolio.

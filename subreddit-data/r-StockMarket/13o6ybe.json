They were operating as an effective monopoly despite being multiple companies, due to the price fixing. Eventually shit caught up to them and they needed to lower their prices in order to stay competitive in the market. There\u2019s lots of stuff out there about this one, it\u2019s pretty interesting actually and worth looking into (or watching a YouTube video on it lol) regardless. \n\nFor examples of successful boycotts which have triggered company changes you would probably have to go further back, I can\u2019t remember any recent ones. Although there was that one protest of factory workers at some mass production site which caused one of the large food/beverage companies in the countries to increase pay and benefits. Not a boycott but similar idea I guess. Can\u2019t remember what company it was though.. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m getting off topic, my point was really just that it does happen and if there is anything that a company cares about it\u2019s money. And probably nothing else. So if attempting to trigger change, then money is for sure the way to do it, and as a consumer the only money we control is our own. If just 1 person stops buying something then yes it amounts to nothing, but everything has to start somewhere and with someone. Even the largest movements in history started with one voice.",

I'm not saying businesses aren't greedy and constantly trying to cust corners and squeeze every penny out of its product, what I'm saying that they don't just rise prices arbitrarily. It's not a good business move. They have to be competitive, they'll lose sales as more and more people refuse to pay the higher prices. They raise prices due to inflation and rising cost of goods. It's simple economics.\n\nIf there was no inflation in the last 30 years, you'd still see the quality of the food go down as they implement cheaper, lower quality, artificial, and longer lasting ingredients, but prices would stay the same or go down (since cheaper ingredients allow them to afford to do that) to gain a competitive advantage. They go up due to the need to meet costs. \n\nMy main point is this: Mars Incorporated generated $45 billion of revenue in 2022. Idk how much of that is profit, but let's assume it's about 10%, $5 billion. Now why would you *expect* a business (one that sells candy, a luxury product of things), to sacrifice it's profits in the face or rising production costs just to make sure it's obesity enducing crap is just as affordable as it has been?",

Whether it has 12 M&amp;Ms or 10, you still buy 1 bag and eat the whole thing, and you only buy the next one when you get those cravings again. So by it being 10% less product, you\u2019re spending stays unchanged but you eat less M&amp;Ms.\n\nIf it was a staple food like rice or bread, then I agree it wouldn\u2019t matter cause you eat them regularly and will end up buying it 10% more often.",

They have implemented a program around 20 to 30 yrs ago on adding more sugar, salt, and fat to their products. They pay alot for the scientists that work for them, to make their product addictive to consumers. These companies understand that our brain receives a dopamine rush from sugar, salt, and fat. For years these companies have been adding more of these ingredients into the snack and beverage products so people become addicted through the dopamine craving. Look at the ingredients on the product and usually sugar is the number one additive. These companies use different names also for sugar to confuse the consumer. Same with the candy and chocolate companies. The potato chip companies do the same thing. When you are in a store and notice that you want a bag of Doritos or Oreos or M&amp;Ms, or a Coke, and did not go in the store for those items, well now you know why. These companies have you subconsciously, (Dopamine rush), and do not care about your health. They know that the amount of sugar added to their products are causing Diabetes, Strokes, and Heart disease, but don't care. They are greedy for market share and profits.

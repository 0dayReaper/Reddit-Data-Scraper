They also have almost no cost to operate, something like .03-.04% depending. Most managed funds can be upwards of 1% and do not outperform S P index fund long term. \nIf you can\u2019t help yourself and want to try, still pick funds with a basket of stocks you like. VGT is good for tech and has only .10% fees, but this removes a massive amount of risk with individual companies. \nSimilarly, you should just put in a set amount each paycheck if you can and don\u2019t worry too much about weekly ups and downs.",

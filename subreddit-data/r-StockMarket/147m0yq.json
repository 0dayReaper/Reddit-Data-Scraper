FYI living somewhere doesn't instantly mean you LOVE that place or that you are incapable of seeing the flaws of said place. Just because I live in china it doesn't make me a brainwashed tankie or invalidate my arguments. Anyone (that is not completely biased) is capable of recognising that Serpentzas' videos are nothing but cheap clickbait based on sensationalised half truths. China has a lot of problems and flaws, but that doesn't make Serpentza less of an idiot\n\nAs for Nio, if you want to criticise the brand that's completely fine but at least use a trustworthy source. Nio did recall 5000 cars for battery fire risks in **2019** [https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china)\n\nIn case you wonder about Nio safety standards because they are a \"chinese car\", the [ET7](https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/nio/et7/47752) and the [ES8](https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/nio/es8/43499) both have 5 stars in NCAP tests",

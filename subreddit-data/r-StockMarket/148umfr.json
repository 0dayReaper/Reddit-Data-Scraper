    "postText": "I am not looking for stock picks or anything like that. Rather, I am interested in well written analysis on different stocks that I might not be aware of (kind of like DD) or general useful data (flow data, unusual options flow data, etc). I have done a few 7 day free trials and they were actually decent and somewhat informative. The price was a bit high for the trials that I tried out so I cancelled but I think it can be worth it sometimes if the analysis is well researched or it brings something to my attention - maybe a new drug is going to release results soon for a disease for example but its not really known but has a big market.\n\nIn short, is there any subscription that you find actually worth paying for?",

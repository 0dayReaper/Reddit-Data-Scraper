If you\u2019re 3 months in, spend it researching the history, taxes, and system, not individual stocks for now. Passive invest in an index and forget about it, you\u2019re never going to beat the market. You\u2019ll get lucky a few times, and you\u2019ll lose big many times if trying to actively buy and sell. Take Cathie wood for example, we\u2019ll funded, huge pro, seems to make the wrong move at every juncture",

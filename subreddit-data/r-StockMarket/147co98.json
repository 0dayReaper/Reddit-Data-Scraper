Where you know most of people are going to sell\u2026 whenever a retail trader is selling (or even buying) guess who is on the other side selling to that retail trader?.. considering they get in with huge sizes, is like if a train ride over you.. they slam the market on the other side until they met the stop losses.. because of course they need to get out now.. and where they is the same amount of big liquidity (orders) they need? Where the stop losses are.. so they hit your stop loss, they execute their exit and they take home all the retail money.",

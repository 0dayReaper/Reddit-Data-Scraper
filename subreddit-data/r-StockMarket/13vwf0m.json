    "postText": "Hey lads! I\u2019m sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it\u2019s literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I\u2019ve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.\n\nI always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there\u2019s any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that \u201cUnited Drug\u201d who is one of Ireland\u2019s largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That\u2019s almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I\u2019d add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It\u2019s suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.\n\nAfter reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they\u2019re a private company lol\n\nI did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I\u2019m not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I\u2019ve personally never done it so I\u2019m not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they\u2019re a good shout or not.",

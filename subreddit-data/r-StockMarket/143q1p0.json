When I say that think about big banks like Wells Fargo or chase, netflix Microsoft google Amazon Apple if you were to stick to blue chips you will be good. You learn as you go no amount of studying will help you. You have to lose money and make money to EARN experience. Buy 1 share of companies you like. Buy one of different companies that are PROFITABLE REAL BUSINESS, watch them and treat them like a tamagotchi, giving it attention each day and watching news cycle about the stocks you pick. Don\u2019t buy cheap stocks your not skilled enough to know what\u2019s a good buy. Cheap stocks are cheap for a reason. After a few years you will be skilled enough to try options on the positions you hold.",

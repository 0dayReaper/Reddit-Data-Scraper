    "postText": "According to the latest study by Kantar Worldpanel, Coca-Cola has officially become the most popular brand in the [fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry worldwide.](https://kundkundtc.com/blog/top-fmcg-companies-in-india/) Colgate, a dental brand, secured the second position, followed by Dettol, a cleaning brand, in third place.\n\nThe study, known as the Brand Footprint study, is conducted annually by Kantar Worldpanel and provides a broad perspective on the global FMCG industry. It ranks the most chosen brands and offers insights into consumer preferences.\n\nThe study reveals that emerging markets now contribute to 51 percent of global spending on FMCG products, a significant increase from 48 percent in just three years. While developed markets show minimal growth, emerging countries have been driving the value growth in the FMCG industry. In 2016, these countries contributed $34 billion to the global industry, with Russia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines being the top contributors.\n\nCoca-Cola continues to dominate as the most chosen brand globally, reaching a penetration rate of 42 percent worldwide. In nine countries, [Coca-Cola has achieved a penetration rate of over 80 percent](https://www.coca-cola.com/in/en) among the population. Dove, on the other hand, attracted the highest number of new households, with 14 million more households choosing the brand in the past year. Consumer decisions at the shelf, on average, cost $1.92, and Coca-Cola greatly benefits from these choices.\n\nJosep Montserrat, the Global [CEO of Kantar Worldpanel](https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global), emphasizes that a brand's growth is determined by being chosen by more people more frequently. He also highlights the importance for brands to identify valuable opportunities, whether in emerging regions with growing populations or by innovating to meet unmet needs in developed markets.\n\nThe Brand Footprint study by Kantar Worldpanel is a comprehensive research initiative that covers 73 percent of the global population. It includes data from one billion households across 43 countries and five continents, representing 75 percent of the global GDP.",

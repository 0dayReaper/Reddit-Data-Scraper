    "postText": "IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).",

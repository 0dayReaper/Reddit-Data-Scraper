    "postText": "1. **You don't have to take a trade each day** \\- it's okay to sometimes spend 3-4 hours in a day without taking a single trade. A good trader is all about knowing when he has an edge over the market. When he has an edge, he capitalizes upon it, but when there's no edge, he knows how to abstain from creating losses. It's not wasted time, it's preparing for a profitable trade.\n2. **Know when to cut losses (don't trade on hope)**\\- why when a trade goes in the right direction, you don't want to close it because it might go on more, but when it goes in the wrong direction you believe it can turn around at any point? This is called trading on hope. Know when a trade has failed, and cut your losses fast. Most professional traders have less than 50% or even 40% win rate yet they're still profitable because when they win they win big and when they lose they lose small.\n3. **If you know something, there are probably thousands of other traders who know the same thing:** Many new traders fall into the trap of believing they have some information that only they know, and that can give them an edge over the market. Most of the time, thousands of other traders are thinking just like you, acting in lockstep. Try to use this to your leverage, understanding that others will use the same piece of information as you and setting up trades to profit off their predicted actions.",

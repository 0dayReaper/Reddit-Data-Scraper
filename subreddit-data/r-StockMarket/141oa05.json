Just wait until the Tesla compact car out produces the model Y. \n\nThat doesn't even consider full self driving's total impact. I just got the new FSD update and it's way better than it used to be. It's like it went from a student driver to someone in their 20's. It's driving pretty normally now compared to sluggish and indecisive decision making it used to do. A few more iterations of hardware with software updates and Tesla will have robotaxis on the streets. \n\nAlso, their battery and grid storage business will be sold out through the 2030's no matter how much they produce. The demand is virtually endless for those products.\n\nNow is still a good time to buy Tesla stock. Their competition can't catch up on almost any front other than BYD.",

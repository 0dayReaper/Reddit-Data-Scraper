It was Elon Musk doing standup. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"A journalist wrote something unflattering about Tesla, so I had them followed by a team of private investigators.\" and he raises up a poster of some unflattering pictures of the journalist eating a sandwich. Bezos laughed, hard, but everyone else was nervously laughing. \n&gt; \n&gt; The next joke was \"The left likes cancel culture but they just cancelled their dignity. Woke enough for you?\", and got the same response. \n&gt; \n&gt; After a few more jokes like this, that's when Adam saw his opportunity and pounced. \"Elon, I appreciate the effort, but these performances just aren't entertaining, I wish I had the performances back in the AdamWork coworking space.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Adam could see his Ambush was working, because people seemed to be waking out of their luxury induced stupor. But Elon always thinks ahead and had an exact plan for such a scenario. Elon yells \"Robot Tesla, Activate!\"\n&gt; \n&gt; And the gold plated Tesla transformers into a humanoid-like robot and stands up. At first Adam thought it was a transformers robot, but it was just an elaborate transformers-like costume made of cardboard with someone inside. He rushes Adam but trips over the costume cardboard. That's when Adam uses his chance to escape. \n\nFrom the failed Netflix pitch 'The Inside Story of Adam Neumann and WeWork'",

My wife and I both had HR approve work from home status per the pandemic (as everyone in our company did, yes we worked for the same company). When they started asking people to come back to the office she asked them to adhere to their own policy of putting it in writing, declaring a reason, and having a discussion on the change of a WFH status with not only the direct manager but the second level manager. None of that happened for her. They kept pushing her to come back, and her request was simple \u201cfollow the steps outlined in YOUR (the companies) policy. They refused to do so. They let her go but literally phrased it as \u201cwe are accepting your voluntary resignation\u201d. She was denied unemployment and all that jazz. \n\nFor me they fired me. Strait up. Called it a \u201creduction in force\u201d, offered me severance, and didn\u2019t fight me on unemployment. I personally think it was because her manager was a piece of shit and mine wasn\u2019t, but we both saw the writing on the wall. \n\nSo while it \u201cworked out for me\u201d because I got let go properly, they fucked her over, and the reason we\u2019re no longer working there is the same. \n\nWe spoke to lawyers about her firing and there is no legal requirement for a company to follow their own. Damn. Policies. It was insane. There are no worker rights or protections in the US. \n\nSo long story short, \u201cmake them fire you\u201d doesn\u2019t always work out in a country that lacks unions or worker protection. Absolute 100% bull shit.",

Zoning plays a big part in this, forcing people to take part in the extremely inefficient system of traveling from one place to a far away place just because working near your house is forbidden. \n\nIt\u2019s all a scam to get you out of the house and spending money on things you would otherwise not need. It may have started as support for workers commuting, but then the entire economy became reliant on these massive loans for cars, massive loans for houses near jobs (cities), massive sprawling shopping centers to attract more spending near restaurants that are more expensive to eat at than cooking (which you can\u2019t do because you have no time or energy after commuting). \n\nAnd people wonder why wfh is so amazing and life changing. Don\u2019t even get me started on the child care component.",

    "postText": "EDIT - I can't share the video so I guess I can't show how Portfolio managers quantify risk so wtf ever on that part; but I'm going to suggest from experience that this isn't really how money works through the system and how risk is actually managed.\n\nRather I'm going to suggest that there's a much simpler way to see what trading firms and clearing houses are actually doing to make a market.\n\nI'm going to argue that because Market Makers buy the bid and sell the asking price, that if you buy the bid of the front month and sell the ask of the back month you get a P/L curve that looks like this:\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Sjn](http://opcalc.com/Sjn)\n\nI would then argue that if you adjust volatility you'll see how that P/L curve changes: example thus\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Sjt](http://opcalc.com/Sjt)\n\nEventually you see this behavior pretty plainly in the charts and you don't really care anymore about doing the calculations and finding the curves.\n\nFor instance I expect the VIX to increase because of this:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/TnAHD6Y2/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TnAHD6Y2/)\n\nI expect a \\~16% or so increase. But in the above example the market makers roughly see a 9% increase.\n\nThis is more accurate because that is where they are neutral for the entirety of the time as they trace price across the curve.\n\nIf you go back to the previous link that showed the +16% volatility result, you see that we still have only about a limited downside of $420 on the SPY, but an upside of about $436.50; I adjusted this when I had more time to 9% which is more accurate and gets a topside target of about $435.50. It won't change the results below if you just run the numbers for $435.50 you'll see how the market maker derives the bid ask spread. Further proving the point that price is in response to market maker liquidity.\n\nMapping the curve onto the SPY we see this purple curve here:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/w3SXexdL/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/w3SXexdL/)\n\nNotice that the bottom of the curve is the prior support level around 423 which was the previous highs that broke out above.\n\nYou tell me...do you think it's a coincidence that I derive that price level from the method above?\n\nNotice the $436 level is the past sticky spot (support that failed) of April 2022 which is now resistance.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/EA5HjP1g/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EA5HjP1g/)\n\nDo you think that is a coincidence? If you do, then stop trading you're just going to hurt yourself and you might as well go get a government pension.\n\nOf course it's not a coincidence.\n\nGenerally speaking the Market Makers who want a breakeven price (that P/L curve where the profit/loss is $0), set those levels BASED on these targets.\n\nThey offer the market these prices and that's why price behaves as it does, generally, through its random walk.\n\nLet's use July 21st as the example:\n\nHere's what the market maker is offering to take the short side. You short, they buy and offer your to sell to you if price keeps going higher.\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Sjq](http://opcalc.com/Sjq)\n\nHere's what the market maker is taking:\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Sjs](http://opcalc.com/Sjs)\n\nOffering $135 profit vs Taking $144. A spread of $9.\n\nThe point so far is that you can map out where the MARKET MAKER'S LIQUIDITY is.\n\nThat's where price will seek. Market makers want to be market neutral. Price seeks their liquidity zones. These zones are identifiable in price and time, price action.\n\nThey are easily visible in Technical Analysis which only losers think big money trading firms don't use Technical Analysis....\n\nThese things are HIDDEN to you.\n\nObvious to me.\n\nAnd it's why YOU underperform the markets. I would love to explain more. feel free to discuss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS.  \nThis also is not a coincidence:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/L1U4kyfB/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/L1U4kyfB/)",

For instance if you reinvest your dividends weekly - even if the stock goes up, you have actually decreased your compounding by about 4x than if you had just used the dividends to pay down cost of capital.\n\nWhat is cost of capital?\n\nExamples:\n\n* Debt - 5% yield; cost of capital is roughly 7% or 12%-9% depending on if you're using margin and how much.\n* Equity - generally speaking however much a business pays in dividends. In your parlance, how much bills you pay with your equity.\n\nA position should be sized according to its impact to your buying power which is all your cash and all your margin.\n\nExample QQQ and TQQQ. QQQ = 1, therefore TQQQ = 3x.\n\nYou'd buy 3 shares QQQ for every 1 share TQQQ you'd buy.\n\nThat is an example of a relative position size. This matters when you go between sectors because for instance you might buy gold then use its equity on margin to buy QQQ. What is the leverage between the two. That's more difficult to figure out but still straightforward, you compare how much each move relative to each other.\n\nThis matters because you want to make sure to always keep your relative leverage between all your positions at about 1:1.\n\n**THIS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY:** *overweight, equal weight, underweight.*\n\nI don't know if that's how analysts and the general Stock Broker uses those terms correctly anymore, they probably don't since 95% of the market is full of idiots.\n\nBut that's what it's referring to.\n\nHow much of your buying power should be in any one position?\n\nThat's up to you. I typically have 100% of my equity in gold. Why? Because I have excellent cost on gold. I have paid down the debt I used to buy gold so much that now the world would have to have a literal Nuclear War for it to impact my liquidity.\n\nHow big the position is will influence how much it impacts your buying power; your capital, when it moves.\n\nYou need to be able to survive the drawdowns so if a stock has 50% drawdowns and it's your only stock, you probably can't put more than 25% of your buying power into it. Ex. 100,000; you own $50,000 of that stock. 25,000 is your equity and 25,000 is on margin.\n\nIf that stock goes down 50% you wipe out your equity.\n\nSo there's the whole kit; position sizing in a nutshell.\n\nYour goal is to take the money you used to buy a stock and pay it down. It's really that simple.\n\nExample: I bought X# of shares of XLE just 2 weeks ago. I already paid it off in full.\n\nI own the shares for $0 cost.\n\nNo that doesn't mean buy it in cash, that means you earned $X from your investments and operations to pay down the amount of cash you put into it. The full ROIC: return on invested capital.",

Its essentially a funnel for web traffic for the users that pay for the service. So, if the feds really looked into your use, they could probably see that YOU were using a VPN at the time, but so were X hundred other people at the same time. So how can they prove that it was you doing illegal shit and not someone else? Any reputable VPN will not log its users data. That means even if they were subpoenaed by a court to show their users traffic, they would have nothing useful to show.",

Disney plus has a pretty nice platform. Prime is terrible, although some of their content is good. All other platforms are terrible in comparison to Netflix and Disney +. \n\nThe only company that can contend with Netflix is Disney.  Disney is a fantastic company with fantastic IP.

Let that sink in.\n\nAnd expectations were nearly double that. Those expectations aren't completely arbitrary and are justification for the premium you're paying when you buy NFLX. You also failed to mention that they projected their worst quarter for new subscriptions in the history of the company (1MM).\n\n&gt;They are making the most money, and creating the most content. Which inevitably makes Netflix more and more valuable with each passing year.\n\nFor now, but that content costs quite a bit, and their competitors are growing faster. So that doesn't really make them \"inevitably... more and more valuable with each passing year.\" If anything, it makes them look less valuable than previously thought (hence the drop.) You can't ignore HBO and all the rest either. More options, even if inferior, means more dilution, means smaller market share down the road.\n\nI love Netflix and I agree that they're the best streaming platform in terms of tech. It's not even close really. I don't at all agree that they are worth their current price.",

I feel like there are so many pricey stocks in the market that you can say that of most companies (that current valuations are expensive). In Canada, HBO Max is branded Crave TV. And the Cost of Crave TV + HBO &amp; Movies together (which I'm pretty sure = HBO Max) is  $20 CAD.  Netflix is $10 CAD basic, $15 CAD for the standard plan, and $19 for premium/4k.  I did have Crave &amp; HBO &amp; Movies for about 6 months. I liked Netflix better and haven't canceled Netflix since the days I subscribed which was like 7 years ago? (I currently pay for premium @ $19/mo)\nPerhaps I'm not giving international options enough credit. Hulu isn't a thing in Canada either. You pretty much have Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Crave + HBO &amp; Movies.  I don't really like prime, I didn't care to keep Crave around. \n\nIt's unfortunate HBO Max is owned by AT&amp;T because I don't care for AT&amp;T enough to take the rest of the company's ops along with HBO. I don't want Netflix paying out those kind of dividends when we need to be focused about putting that cash into new content and staying ahead over the next 20-30 years.\n\nThere are other options out there, and Netflix is pricey, but I still feel good about having some of my money in Netflix. I feel like they have enough IP and enough of a headstart that you can continue to add competition and they will continue to grow regardless. (I also think the allure of 'New' streams will fade and people will settle on the best ones which includes Netflix)",

An estimate of 1.6 billion TV in uses in about 1.42 billion homes. 4.2 billion viewing audience and still growing. TV is still increasing at a 9% CAGR. And that's all future streaming customers.

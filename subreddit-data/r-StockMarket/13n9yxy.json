The DTCC is the largest clearinghouse in the world, but there are also other clearinghouses such as CME Group, ICE Clear Europe, and LCH.Clearnet.\n\nThe fact that Allspring is the former asset management division of Wells Fargo could be a factor in its decision to retire from all services with the DTCC. Wells Fargo has been under scrutiny in recent years for a number of scandals, and it is possible that Allspring is trying to distance itself from the bank.\n\nIt is also possible that Allspring is simply looking for a more cost-effective clearinghouse. The DTCC is one of the most expensive clearinghouses in the world, and Allspring may be able to save money by using a competitor.\n\n*edit: grammar*",

This event marked one of the most significant collapses in the history of the financial industry.\n\n**Bear Stearns:** In 2008, Bear Stearns, a prominent investment bank, faced severe financial distress and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. as part of an emergency rescue package facilitated by the Federal Reserve.\n\n**Countrywide Financial Corporation:** In 2008, Countrywide Financial Corporation, one of the largest mortgage lenders in the United States, faced substantial losses due to the subprime mortgage crisis. It was eventually acquired by Bank of America.\n\n**Washington Mutual:** In 2008, Washington Mutual, a major savings and loan association, faced a liquidity crisis and was placed into receivership by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Its banking operations were subsequently sold to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\n\n**Bankia:** In 2012, Bankia, a Spanish banking group, experienced financial difficulties primarily due to its exposure to the real estate market. The Spanish government had to intervene and nationalize the bank to prevent a collapse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe odds of a financial institution succeeding after filing for bankruptcy depend on various factors such as size, complexity, nature of problems, and the strength of the management team. Generally, smaller institutions have a higher chance of success compared to larger ones. This is because smaller institutions tend to be less complex and have fewer issues, making it easier for them to attract new investors and creditors.\n\nThe nature of the institution's problems also plays a crucial role in determining its chances of success. Institutions facing liquidity or solvency problems are more likely to fail compared to those dealing with asset quality or management issues. The strength of the management team is a key factor in determining success. A capable management team is more likely to develop an effective turnaround plan and implement it successfully.\n\nAccording to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), approximately 60% of banks that file for bankruptcy are able to emerge successfully within two years. However, the study found that the odds of success decrease as the size of the bank increases. For instance, only around 40% of banks with assets exceeding $1 billion are able to recover within the same timeframe.\n\nConsidering these factors, the odds of Wells Fargo, a large and complex institution, succeeding after filing for bankruptcy are relatively low. While smaller institutions and those with strong management teams have better chances of success, Wells Fargo faces greater challenges due to its size and complexity.\n\n**Wells Fargo has been facing a number of problems in recent years, including scandals and regulatory fines such as:**\n\n\u2022\tIn 2016, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other regulators for creating millions of fake accounts in the names of its customers without their knowledge or consent.\n\n\u2022\tIn 2018, Wells Fargo was fined $1 billion by the CFPB and other regulators for overcharging customers for auto insurance and other products.\n\n\u2022\tIn 2019, Wells Fargo was fined $500 million by the CFPB and other regulators for discriminating against black and Hispanic borrowers.\n\nThese scandals and fines have damaged Wells Fargo's reputation and led to a loss of customers. In the wake of the fake accounts scandal, Wells Fargo lost over 2 million customers. The bank's earnings have also been affected. In 2018, Wells Fargo's earnings fell by 20%.\n\n*Edited for grammar.*",

They won't be doing any more business with them.\n\n\r  \n\r\n\n* Another company called Allspring Funds Distributor, LLC will start using the same number that Wells Fargo Bank used to have. They will use it to do things like handling mutual funds (which are a type of investment), daily prices (which means the prices of things that change every day), rates (which are like fees), and networking (which means connecting with other companies). This change will happen on May 22, 2023.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Some other companies, like National Securities Corporation, Ultimus Fund Distributors, LLC, Funds Distributor, LLC, and BNYMellon/RE ETF, are also going to stop working with this company. They won't be doing any more business with them either.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Quasar Distributors, LLC will stop using a service called DTCC Payment Axis. It means they won't be using a particular type of payment service anymore. This change will happen on May 22, 2023.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Foreside Distribution Services, L.P. will stop using services like daily prices, rates, networking, and a service called ACATS Fund/SERV. They won't be doing these things anymore after May 23, 2023.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. will start using a service called MF Info Xchange. They will begin using it on June 1, 2023.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Larson Financial Securities, LLC will start participating in a service called Insurance Processing. They will begin doing this on June 5, 2023.\r  \n\r  \n\n* Some other companies, like NAV Consulting Inc, Phoenix American Financial Services, Inc., and ETC Brokerage Services, LLC, will start using a service called Alternative Investment Products. This change will happen on different dates in May.\n\n\r  \n\r\n\n* There are some updates to a directory called NSCC MPID. It has to do with different types of financial products. Some changes are being made to this directory, like removing some entries.\n\nOn a scale 1-100 I would put them at a 65. I think that this is more of insider information towards what is coming with the economy than another bank run, however, with the amount of fear in the market right now if MSM gives this too much attention I'd put it at a 40 given their significant decline in earnings. They can not handle a bank run, not even with $1.9T that's for sure. They lent out way too cheap during COVID when margin requirements were relaxed. It's almost as bad as Debit Suisse.",

One thing you need to consider though is for a private bank that [holds $1.8T in assets and has been having a downhill net battle](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WFC/wells-fargo/total-assets) this is still pretty bad whether it's for the DTCC or for Wells Fargo. If they were to be a small bank I could understand going from name-brand to generic to save money but to be a big bank and do that there's something big happening somewhere in clearing financially.\n\nThey were one of the [first to close credit lines in the 2008 recession](https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/25/pf/credit_limit_pullback/) so they must either have insider information or a phenomenal risk management team. \n\nI'm personally glad that they did regardless of the circumstances, the DTCC is very complicit.",

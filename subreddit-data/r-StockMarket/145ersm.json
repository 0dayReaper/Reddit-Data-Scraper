            "comment": "The first 10 years of the chart can be explained by the introduction of the euro and its subsequent adoption as a reserve currency. Greater adoption on the margins of AUD, CAD (C$), and (china renminbi)CNY during this time period was also important. And the US decreased in value against other currencies during this time period, which impacts the measure.\n\nPost 2015 I would imagine is largely a function of gold prices nearly doubling from 2015-today. China and Russia especially have been behind the move, filling coffers with gold as a diversifier. And in Russia case - well, i think everyone knows what happened in Russia's case - we took all their dollar reserves. The small bump from 13-15 is probably related to euro debt crisis.\n\nNot sure this graph really points to any significant change in the dollar's supremacy. The dollar's role in \\~90% of FX transactions globally hasn't much changed during the last 20 yrs. See [https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r\\_qt2212x.htm](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2212x.htm). Cross border debt/loans is still dominated by USD, most EM pairs don't trade directly, but through the dollar. Bottom line: this idea that BRICs will issue a new currency or start using renminbi is hogwash. china will never open the capital account, china will never give up control by allowing free convertibility, meaning big players could end up stuck with renminbi  for many reasons.\n\nWatch to see whether Saudi's ever de-peg riyal from $. Or ask yourself why Russia, Saudi, wants to use UAE dirham to settle trade rather than any of their own currencies... it's because dirham is also $-pegged. Dollar isn't going anywhere, there's a reason its usage is sticky. Ask yourself, if you had to accumulate a significant amount of any currency, and keep it for possibly many years in a interest bearing account which was liquid at massive levels and would keep its value over long periods without inflation and wouldn't be arbitrarily confiscated, what would you choose? Right, the dollar... and secondly, probably euro.",

                    "comment": "The problem is that reserve currencies are less a store of wealth, and more an exchange rate stabilization tool. Take india and china, for good examples, china decided that devaluation and locking the value to the dollar (at about 8.28 / $) back in jan 94 was the best way to encourage foreign direct investment (think factories) and establish an export oriented (labor suppression) over a long period of time. The US was the largest market - this made sense, and it worked very well. a year of fine tuning and cny stays locked until mid 2005 and china booms during that time. They are now stuck w $s. They can't move away from $s sigificantly.\n\nchina accumulates dollars because suppression f yuan (as proxy for their economic production) requires selling yuan and buying dollars. They then decide to slowly let the yuan appreciate in the context of a US disaster post the subprime bust, to \\~7 cny / $. once QE starts and china seeks to modernize the development model, they allow the cny to manage float, and it has oscillated until now. How did they know in 2005 us markets would bust in 2005? They caused the subprime mess with their massive dollar stash by pushing down interest rates and forcing others into higher yielding securities, because you need to keep FX res in a liquid, interest bearing security - tsys and agency MBS. The point is, china doesn't experience massive growth from 94 to 2016 without locking the yuan to the dollar.\n\n And india, where some of the most boss monetary policy management in the emerging world has been present, keeps most of their exchange reserves in dollars. why? because instead of having active monetary policy through policy rate changes, they manage the FX valuation. India runs massive CA deficits (they consume more than they product, in products terms, they import a ton of gold and oil - they have little of either - and export services like tourism software and snake charmers), so currency valuation has always been of utmost importance. They keep a closed capital account - can't come in or out freely - so outside forces dont overwhelm the real economy.\n\nYou can't even buy an indian government bond as a foreigner. The only way to get policy rates and speculate on the rupee is through a non-deliverable forward that's traded between offshore parties. But, because oil is priced in dollars, and because FDI is dollar heavy, guess what, it makes sense to keep most of your reserves in dollars and to target the rupee dollar rate.",

That action compressed risk spreads across the board which eventually underpriced alt-A/subprime mortgages and, together with low mortgage rates, started the housing bubble. With so much money seeking fixed income spread product return, rating agencies got cozy with investment banks creating new packages for this junk credit, eg CDOs. banks hid much of it through SPVs and ratings agencies turned a blind eye. Anyone who studied macro knew what was going on, and it was surprising greenspan didn't understand it. He really was a bum.\n\nFraud was certainly a problem, too. But the initial spark that started the asset price boom, and the endless supply of cheap credit, can all be understood with china's yuan peg in the context of massive current account surpluses.",

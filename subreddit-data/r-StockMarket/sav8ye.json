I guess the brain adapts to chronic stress lol. This recent drop didn't phase me. \n\nI learned a lot but probably the thing I did that helped the most was running the numbers on \"what if\" scenarios. Because I have a long time horizon it literally doesn't matter if stocks fall for me. In fact, the numbers look better for me if stocks do fall. So I'm happy when they fall. Being aware of the long term math of compound interest helps a ton. \n\nStocks sell off? I just buy more. Even if it's a tiny amount from my 401k. I'm still buying. The math will work out in the end.",

This is the only fund \"theoretically\" that you would have to invest in because it invests in both US and Foreign stocks.  \n\nThat being said, I like a little bit more granularity, because I am not as confident with foreign stocks, so I invest in VTI, VXUS, BNDX and BND.  This covers everything, but the foreign and bond indexes are at a much lower percentage.  Depends on your goals though.  I know some people just love dividends, so they go with SCHD (because it has a higher dividend rate but also has growth).",

The thought here is that even if there is a dip, you could theoretically still be at a higher point in investment then what you were 20 years ago.  There have been total \"crashes\" like 2008 and great depression, but I believe these have only happened a few times the entire stock market life.  I could be wrong on that statement, so don't quote me.  IF that happens when you are ready to retire, start thinking about maybe delaying your retirement a year or two until the stock market picks back up.  But that is just my thinking...  it is really depending on the situation AND how bad you are off financially.  No one can predict the future though.",

The inflation trade and energy crunch trade factors are still strong, and those sectors also got delayed in their recovery rebound due to delta &amp; omicron, so they are still recovery plays. \n\nThe reason old energy &amp; commodity stocks got caught in the downdraft on Friday was that it was a big options expiration day, and a lot of commodity investors deal in options. I wad expecting a big dump in energy &amp; commodities due to the options expiration Friday (but the size of the dump did catch me by surprise)\n\nOf, course, given the structural problems in the stock market right now, energy &amp; commodity stocks can crash just like any other sector\u2019s stocks \u2014 forced selling due to margin calls can cause that, for example. But old energy &amp; basic materials stocks are the best buy-the-dip plays out there right now, assuming there isn\u2019t a catastrophic crash happening, IMO. \n\nI\u2019m not planning on buying dips in tech or other stocks until Spring.",

As well as how much in derivatives that need to ultimately be settled in USD.\n\nIgnore the bank running and ensuing bank failures, there is plenty of USD to go around. /s\n\nIgnore the fact the velocity of money went down massively, and that Dollars actually appreciated during the time of \"the worst inflation in 40 years\" paradoxically (which is actually worse than you think than if USD was actually weakening to justify the higher energy prices, you lost extra purchasing power when filling up).\n\nIgnore the inverted yield curve, it would be normal were there a real inflation because long term rates should price in the higher future inflation and growth.\n\nI believe what you're missing is how far things can be bid up irrationally, and how little it actually means for future prices.  Silver was once bid up to about $40 in the 80's, that didn't mean shit when it spent the next 30 years doing basically nothing.\n\nThere is a fine line between asset and liability, and it's based on price.

Her predictions were insane.  4000 by 2022 etc.   the males looked at her with disdain and ridicule.  The female presenter looked at her as though she had just had a pick axe to break the glass ceiling but decided to throw it away, leaving other female prognosticators to be shunned as well.   \n\nSome time in 2001, Tesla took off and her predictions were not just about the stock price but about AI and unassisted driving and manufacturing in China and Germany.  People started to listen to her.   On Squawk box they no longer laughed at her.  \n\nWhat\u2019s changed about Cathy Wood?  Absolutely Nothing.    She is still telling you why she\u2019s buying what she\u2019s buying.    She still has a 5 year horizon and not 5 days or 5 months.    She sells what\u2019s not working and doubles down on a story if the fundamentals remain.   What\u2019s changed are the expectations of investors.  They do not share the 5 year horizon.",

If there is one, if you bought at the right time, and possibly for short term capital gains which screws up your taxes.  That's not investing, that's pure speculation or gambling.",

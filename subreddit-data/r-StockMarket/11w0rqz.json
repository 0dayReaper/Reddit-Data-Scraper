You were responding to a post about hoarding wealth. I would say that the accumulation of real estate and other illiquid assets constitutes hoarding, whether or not the asset itself is liquid. The point is that the assets are not being used in a way that is generating more wealth.\n\nDon't move the goal post like that.",

As far as I know SVB collapsed due to high interest rates and the bank run. Based on preliminary reports SVB did not invest in some risky trades, they had invested in government bonds (prices of which have an inverse relationship to interest rates).",

Meaning that instead of paying the your liabilities with cash you could in theory pay back a loan you owe with a loan you\u2019ve given. When looking at it like this a more sensical solution to this triad of debt becomes obvious: the first person pays back the $20 debt with his $20 \u2018asset\u2019, the second person now both owes and is owed $20 by the third, at which point they agree to forgive each others\u2019 debt. \n\n\nThe problem with banks is that they work with people who want cash, not some nebulous asset, meaning that the bank has to have cash to pay it\u2019s debts. Well banks usually don\u2019t have all that much cash, even on a good day less than half of what you give a bank is kept as cash.

He stay a night at a hotel that offers him a full refund if he is unhappy with his stay. He stays the night and pays the $30 fee. In the morning before he wakes up the hotel owner pays his debt of $30 to someone else he owed using the visitors $. Throughout the mornin the $30 is handed from one person to the other clearing everyone\u2019s debt in the town. Eventually the $30 lands in the hotel owners hands. The visitor asks for a refund and leaves town with his $30. No new money was made for the town yet all of its debts were paid. So the question is how does this transmit to the real world. The difference is in the three stooges and the town in the dessert everyone gets an equal debt paid so it is fair. In real life everyone owes everyone something different and some people don\u2019t owe anything at all. So this wouldn\u2019t work on a grand scale but possibly for banks. Probably for banks.",

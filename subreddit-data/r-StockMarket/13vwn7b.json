Even with the lower price, it is much harder for a stock to rise 66% than 20%",

Lower priced stocks will move faster, as a percentage of price, than higher priced stocks. The price goes up less people buy it, so rate of change slows. There are of course plenty of exceptions, this is just a general rule. By splitting the stock and lowering the price per share it is made more accessible to a larger group, this increasing the possibility of interest in buying it and raising the price.\n\nFor an extreme example check our Berkshire Hathaway. That stock doesn't really move. Kinda hard to at 140k a share.",

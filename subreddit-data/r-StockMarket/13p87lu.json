In fact a lot in this graphic is misleading, it\u2019s presented in a way to downplay bear markets. A much better metric would be peak to trough, which is what economists would use. If you divide the years 2000-2002 individually it might not seem bad, but it was a 3 year bear market where sp500 fell down around 50%, and nasdaq 80%, that\u2019s not something accented well enough in these infographics, only somewhat in the last image, but with a quick deflection of how it didn\u2019t matter in the end anyway. That\u2019s why 2022 might seem one of the worst ever, but actually it was slightly below average when it comes to bear markets, and slightly larger than average pullbacks. I can give you an even \u201cscarier\u201d stat which is not presented on these graphics, and that\u2019s that from 2000 until 2012 the returns on spx were negative. I\u2019m not trying to speak badly of sp500, it\u2019s obviously been historically a great investment, but this graphic (I think somewhat deliberately) hides a lot the risks associated with equity investment",

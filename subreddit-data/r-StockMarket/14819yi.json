Apple can do this now because well, it is a $3500 PC on your face and not a $500 Phone processor. But the game is on, and cost is important when it comes to sales.",

Or maybe not bomb but it won't be the revelation we all have been waiting for. \n\nIt's a novelty item that will get used more frequently by hardcore enthusiasts and collects dust after one month in the hands of everybody else, like all the other goggles. \n\nI hope that devs jump on that thing and develop some cool software though so I am excited to see where this will lead.",

I haven't used Facebook or Instagram in over a decade.\n\nHowever, I've come to realise that Reddit is just as bad as Facebook. \n\nToo many people pushing a narrative without fact checking or doing any research. Posts and opinions repeated to the point others believe them without validating. So sooo much terrible advice, often by armchair experts who think they know more than they actually do. And good lord, the voting system should just be removed. The number of times I've seen comments upvoted to the top that don't deserve to be there is unimaginable.",

There is some overlap, and which one better understands the market and captures it remains to be seen, but this isn\u2019t really a blue ray vs hddvd situation. \n\nApple focused on augmented reality. They started with the premise of \u201cwhat if Google glass was useable and actually did all that cool shit it was supposed to do\u201d and then worked on making that a reality. It\u2019s basically an invisible projector screen that you can layer images on. \n\nMeta is focused on artificial reality. They want something that can build an entire 3D world to immerse yourself in. They want you to be able to feel you\u2019re somewhere else, not throw out an image of somewhere else that has funky depth. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure which will be more useful. Apple\u2019s history of executing seems pretty solid, and I wonder if meta makes something as useable even if/when the succeed on their 3D immersion goals.",

The problem with it is many employees will slack off if they can, hence the low productivity, and hence many companies are bringing employees back.

It's not too expensive for any of the companies I'm working with and they're frothing at the bit to get their hands on a bunch. It'll change the way they'll demo their products. It'll change the way they'll design the layouts of their systems inside of buildings. They tried it with the hololens and that kinda worked, but this is so much better already.\n\nPeople here seem to forget that Apple didn't use to focus on the consumer market at all, that kinda came when Jobs introduced the iPod. Before that, Apple was known for making expensive but quality business hardware and software with consumer products being less of a priority for most generations. And they kinda never really stopped. The Mac Pro is not meant for regular consumers (although I'm sure some got one). Let alone things like the Pro Display XDR that was memed on heavily for being an expensive display, but is considered by professionals one of the best displays in the field for its purpose and price.\n\nIt's a useful skill to realize that if you're not the target audience for something, that doesn't mean there is none.",

For instance, at least in my work place, the higher up in the company, the more meetings. Every single higher level executive complains nonstop about either not seeing people on zoom, how awful zoom is, or the inability to properly deliver speeches over zoom. Give them a product that removes the barrier to meetings across geographical areas and timezones? they'd pay an absolute arm and leg for that. Even at 3.5k, even if only the top 10 executives get them, that will trickle down over time, and eventually make a huge change. Similarly, I used to work in marketing, they too would have bought 20 just to force prospective users to use them and see what their products 'could look like'. \n\nAlso, in agreement with your points again, this isn't far off form the ipod video. No one wanted that when it came out, people thought it was neat, but also stupid, \"why would I want to watch The Office on this 2\" screen???\" but a few iterations later you end up with an ipod touch/iphone/ipad and everyone and their mother wanted one.",

Not many games.  Porn is a draw not going to lie, but my horniness wasn't enough to buy one.\n\nThis headset being sold as more of an overall piece of tech has more potential.  \n\nIf my wife doesn't want me watching football in the living room, I'll watch on my PC or phone but its just not as good as the big screen.  This headset provides the ultimate viewing experience anywhere.\n\nI'll get the benefit of porn and games, but its about what comes next.\n\nWe can't imagine what the future holds.  Like try explaining Uber, Twitter, or Venmo to people in 1999 when tech stocks were hurdling towards a bubble.

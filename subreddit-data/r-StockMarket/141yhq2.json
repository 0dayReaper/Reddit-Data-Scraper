    "postText": "I've got 9/15 $35 SQQQ Calls but I'm getting worried because big tech seems like a force of nature esp with the emergence of AI, it's like they're all on fucking steroids and a correction may be a tiny 5% pullback before it explodes into the stratosphere.\n\nAbout a month or two ago I was fairly confident in a recession happening, but recently with new data coming out, it seems like there ain't gonna be a recession. \n\nStrong labor market, inflation still sticky but it seems like a pause in June is certain which might mean there wont be any more rate hikes this year, and it seems like people who once thought a recession was coming in the 2nd half of the year and now saying either there ain't a recession coming or the odds of a recession are significantly lower than they use to be.\n\nThis is pure speculation but with the emergence of AI it feels like the magnificent 7 (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, GOOG, META, NVDA, TSLA) is going to absolutely smash their next earnings calls in late July. \n\nI'm really just looking for opinions on how and why big tech will see a decently sized correction in the near future because the way things look now, it's hard to fathom a big tech EVER slowing down.",

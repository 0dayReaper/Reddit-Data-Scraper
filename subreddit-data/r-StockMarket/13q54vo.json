And it doesn't hold up when you consider how often these policies are diametrically opposed. Or when you see that legislation has real-world effects that voters either support or detest, and that directly affects which politicians maintain power.\n\nYou probably believe you're enlightened, but really you're just jaded and hurting yourself through delusion. You've taken away all of your own power by convincing yourself (without evidence) that your voice means nothing in the face of \"totalarian control\". The fact is, there's a political party that passes legislation that aims to protect people, and there's one that passes legislation that aims to protect corporations, and very little in-between right now.\n\nIt's delusional to \"both sides\" this because you can look in many places and literally see the results of different legislation and policies that one party has pushed through while the other opposes it and fights to reverse course, sometimes succeeding. Drug legalization and decriminalization is a big example. Safety and environmental regulations are another.\n\nIt doesn't even matter if the politician really \"cares\" about the talking point or not if they work towards it and secure results for voters. It doesn't matter to me if someone is pure evil on the inside if all their actions on the outside are towards good causes. Basically, doing good for selfish reasons is still good.",

The increase in unsecured government guaranteed student loans has allowed colleges to charge exorbitant rates for no good reason. If loans are harder to get, less people will be able to attend and fund the colleges, and the price will come down. Student loans have given colleges a blank check at the cost of the financial security of america\u2019s youth and workforce. College price should go down, rather than just continuing this cycle so that every college educated person is forced to be saddled with debt just to get a job that sometimes didn\u2019t even require a college degree a few decades ago.\n\nEdit: I hate the whole \u201cyou took out a loan, you should pay the loan\u201d mentality as if the government, our parents, society, haven\u2019t been the ones saying \u2018You have to go to college to get a good job!\u2019 For the past century. What else do you expect an 18 year old to do? Also with the amount of interest that gets added, a lot of people have a higher principal now than when they graduated. How the hell does that make sense?",

Imagine how that would add to the depression already felt by the uneven distribution of financial promise we continue to see in the direction of the world's economy- always, since the '60s &amp; '70s, more and more towards the 'already wealthy' and little or nothing towards the continuously hope-less classes.\n\nIt ain't over till it's over! Forty more million angry citizens do not bode well for the current restless situation that's so prevalent in our country now. As we already sit on a 'powder keg' that's ready to explode- the second 'Great Depression is nearing our doors.\n\nWe must hope for a 'Dancing God' rather than another 'lying Devil' lurking behind the curtain.\n\nStonehenge555",

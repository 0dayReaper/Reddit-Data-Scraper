    "postText": "After closely monitoring the market for over a year and semi-actively trying to learn, I have come to realize that **I still have no clue what's going on.**  \nThere are varying perspectives regarding the market's future, like some individuals suggest an imminent crash, while others don't seem to care about the red flags and just keep doing there thing.  Should I wait for a potential crash that could be many years away, potentially missing out on significant gains? How far away are we from a crash? Like we got all these recurring patterns and cycles like the business cycle, how come we can't predict all this? And isn't crash inevitable? Though I still can't believe it would be my best bet to keep my funds in cash. While I am aware that I have a long investment horizon ahead of me, don't they say time is money in the market?  \nAlso: my apologies for the profanity in the title, it's to gain more attraction. Thanks in advance.",

Keep yourself broke by putting your extra cash into this fund.   This will keep you from getting tempted every time that something shiny comes along.  Don't worry about dividends yet, worry about growth.   Time in the market is your key.   If you start investing now, you will be a wealthy man by the time you are 50.",

You may be able to retire comfortably, which is a wonderful goal, but to generate substantial wealth, you still need to invest in assets to increase your skills whether that is schooling, a trade, books or other types of training. Ironically, the save yourself poor mentality can be detrimental to wealth creation if taken to the extreme.",

All I do, is position myself to get lucky, in a way that I won't lose much if I'm not. The market is random most of the time. We have no control over the way it moves and it's futile to tr to predict it. All you can do, is take position when a setup offers you a great way to do so.",

            "comment": "The concept of investing in the stock market is simple\u2026 you consider a company\u2019s future and invest in its stock, the company\u2019s success is your investment growth. Now, there is a separate concept of \u201cthe market\u201d where it may behave predictably or sometimes irrationally. The market goes up and down and to the right, based on micro and macroeconomic events, global conflicts and so on. Even worse, the market is influenced by bad actors like insider traders and institutional investors who can move prices. \n\nEven worse, humans make it more complicated by creating investment vehicles like puts/calls/margin/leverage and so called options (all which I know nothing about) to lock in prices. It gets to the point where it becomes nothing more than betting to win against the house like a casino. \n\nFinally, the markets then enter declines or increases called bear/bull cycles where you have weeks or months of prolong losses or gains. Occasionally you have bubbles that pop like the dot com crash, the sun prime lending crash, and so on. \n\nIt\u2019s really all not that hard when you consider you, the retail investor just moves with the waves of the big guys. Invest what you can afford to lose and you can sleep at night. Diversify and you won\u2019t be affected much by the swings. \n\nAs always, talk to a financial expert who can help you reach your financial goals. You need to consider your entry, how long you\u2019ll be in the market, and how aggressive / how much risk you\u2019re willing to accept.",

            "comment": "a lot of good advise so far. here is a little more.\n\nmake sure you open a roth IRA, and a traditional ira, besides a regular brokerage account. don't worry funding everyone of them just have them as buckets for needs over the years. in the roth... max it out if you can and like everyone said, low fee index. this grows tax free and you pull it out tax free.\n\ntraditional ira. a bucket for later when you move between places with 401ks and want to roll them over. grows tax free, but you pay when it comes out.\n\nregular brokerage. taxed when you sell anything, if there are losses you can \"harvest them\" and use against your taxes and other investments over the years. short term gains are part of your annual income, long term gains taxed at around 15-20%\n\nsetup a schedule say at the beginning of the month, end of the month, every two weeks, or whenever your pay check comes in.. do auto transfers to take care of you and do recurring entries into index funds or themed funds like insurance, technology, medical, total market etc if you wish.\n\nonly put in that you don't need now and are ok risking going up and down.\n\nfor now do a set and forget, don't look every day or so, it will get you itchy.\n\nIf you like some companies for direct investment do them, but know companies can come and go, as you have seen recently... even banks \ud83d\ude21\n\nhave dividends in companies reinvest.\n\nmake sure you have a separate bank for your day to day stuff... mixing them just makes things more itchy and annoying.\n\ntiming the market is hard, institutions manipulate them like crazy, and even people with 20-30 years still get in to situations where we get out before things recover, or have things on a watch list and miss the movement.\n\nfor now no more than 10 positions, preferably 5 to start including index funds in the accounts... becomes a nightmare to watch and review every time you want to rebalance.\n\nand make sure you keep 6mo of savings liquid, in a savings, CD, or something.you will need this eventually for emergency funds, deposit on an apartment, or part of a down payment on a car, or home over time.",

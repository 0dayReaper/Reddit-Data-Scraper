I think people are still getting ahead of themselves a bit and it makes for some great buzz words by people who don\u2019t know what they are doing, but there is some actual existing value underlying that hype this time, whether it precisely matches the hype or not.",

                    "comment": "I don't mean to come across as an authority on this subject but I do operate on a daily basis within these spaces. Here's who I am and what I think but this is just one guy's opinion.\n\ncredentials: I'm a software developer with 15 years of experience who has worked extensively with AI. I also understand blockchain to the degree that I could implement one myself if I had reason to do so. I'm also a small business owner.\n\nopinion:\n\nI think this is right on the money. However, I believe that it underestimates the breadth and acceleration of progress being made in this space. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) is the central hub for AI development. If you take a look at the [models search page](https://huggingface.co/models), you can see that there are filters on the left that allow you to filter the models by task. You'll see that the list is rather extensive and includes \n\nRight now, the open source models are catching up with OpenAI. There's a whole backstory about Facebook's Llama model's terms of use and such. But that has, just in the past month or two, gotten resolved and we now have open source models that are quite capable.\n\nI think if you look at call centers, alone, and the implications of locally hosted [AIs that synthesize speech and video with customizable diction, facial expressions, etc](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JavaFXpert/Chat-GPT-LangChain). Especially if that AI has been fine-tuned on the corpus of knowledge that you'd typically give to a call center representative.\n\nAnd this is ignoring the fact that the software developers that are working on these things are bootstrapping the hell out of their own work. Github's Copilot came out only a year or two ago and it's been shown to double the productivity of developers, and all that does is auto-complete at most a block of code at a time in a specific source-code file.\n\nThe systems that developers are currently working on to automate the development of entire software systems are accelerating at an incredible pace. Here's [one such example](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT). The amount of activity on that codebase is crazy. And that's ignoring the fact that that's just an example of how tools such as langchain and llamaindex can be combined to create incredibly powerful systems.\n\nLarge Language Models like GPT enable developers with a tool that has been quite alien to us for a long time: common sense. It's what prompted the rhyme \"I really hate this damned machine; I wish someone would sell it. It never does just what I want but only what I tell it\".\n\nThe idea isn't to have an entire system operate within the confines of a LLM but rather to delegate small, straight-forward tasks like data extraction, for example. I have spent *so many hours* dealing with the fact that, e.g., the data a customer provided has \"zero-width\" spaces in it (yes, those exist and they're a *bitch*).\n\nWhen it comes to AI, GPU VRAM = Power. The amount of memory on your GPU dictates how good of an AI you can run.\n\nI think that once medium-sized companies become aware of this fact, there is going to be an increase in demand for GPUs that the market has yet to fully realize. And there is no doubt in my mind that the world is vastly underestimating the magnitude of what's going on here. It's not about chatbots and image generation.",

Im predominently a property guy but its kind of a slow burn. I was never invested in US tech stocks and so bought up during the bear market.\n\nMy understanding in short is NVDA is way ahead in the hardware and software for AI. That all these companies like Amazon Google will be needing to purchase their products in the future and they will make bank. Ive also read because they are dominating the hardware its sort of like iPhone and the app store where because they control the hardware they control the software.\n\nSo my guess is the biggest risk is AMD or Intel making something better. From what Ive read on tech sites though NVDA is significantly ahead.",

The thing that blockchain brings to the table is decentralization of control of the record, but that\u2019s an *extremely* niche requirement that wouldn\u2019t be at all useful for most large organizations.\n\nThat\u2019s the stumbling block I run into with most proposed blockchain applications at this point. At best, they are often things that you *could* do with blockchain, but not things that blockchain does any better than existing solutions.\n\nMost of them come down to using it as a database with version control with the decentralization being either an afterthought or something of a detriment to the proposal. But that decentralization is the only thing that it brings to the table, so that\u2019s the feature you need to find a compelling use for. \u201cHosting records\u201d is done as well or better by other technology.\n\nThis is where I think LLMs and deep learning models have a utility advantage over blockchain. There are uses that cannot easily be filled by any other existing technology other than hiring a person to do it, and people are both slower and more expensive.",

Instead i just see articles about how to actually spot manipulated stocks. which while it could be useful, isn't exactly helpful when im gonna need upwards of 100 manipulated stocks. its just not time efficient.\n\nAnd so in a last ditch effort I've come to reddit to ask if anyone knows a website which logs which stocks have been manipulated and at what times? preferably of course it would show the graph so i could just get the data straight off the site without having to do more scavenging around.",

            "comment": "What you\u2019re looking for is a black and white answer to a grey problem. \n\n1. GME: the fabled short squeeze. Hedge Funds shorted it to oblivion. But some people realized if they buy and hold, this thing moons because the funds will need to get back in to cover their over-shorted positions. How does an AI track that? The shorting interest vs. pricing action? That only gives you short squeezes. \n2. Pump and Dump\u2019s? Well, AI will see that probably follows most IPO\u2019s. If I\u2019m wrong, someone please correct me, but IPO\u2019s typically come out at a high price then crater (and may recover is the business proves itself) which an AI would probably see as a pump and dump. And how do you track this? Insider buying and selling? Would you also need to track the news or something to see how is this stock being pumped up? (Check Cramer\u2019s Twitter?) \n3. Is something manipulation or a trading theory? Before earnings, Puts tend to be pricier because people will pay a premium for downside protection. Manipulation or just insurance premium? \n4. Enron doing all its illegal shenanigans? Yeah, 100% manipulation. But most people didn\u2019t realize it until it came crashing down. Lehman with its off Balance Sheet transactions? They blew up, but no one (not even the auditors) saw it. The rating agencies not correctly marking MBS until the banks sold their positions to unsuspecting clients? You\u2019d need to be God to know all these things. \n\nTLDR: an AI (which would really just be machine learning) will need access to far more information than what is publicly available to ever be able to identify stocks being manipulated in real time.",

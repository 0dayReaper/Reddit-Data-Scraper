With interest rates I think this will be a drag on investment and a slow grind of slightly positive to slight negative growth will persist. Ongoing poor productivity and dislocated markets will see inflation sit above target making rates stickier than expected by many.\n\nGood cash returns while markets balance out.

Powell said this, all Fed officials basically said this.\n\nDo you think inflation is gonna go down magically to 2% with unemployment rate at 3.5%? No if rate hike takes 1 year to affect the real economy, we're only feeling the effect of 1% Fed fund rate. Like Fed Bostic said, the hard part hasn't even begun. And when the hard part hits, that's when people scream at the Fed telling them to cut rates, and they're gonna have to hold it. The difference between a Fed's soft landing and a mild recession is very minute. 0 growth is gonna feel like a mild recession, and we're not there yet. Also, I don't think people realize this, but the Fed forecast, and many economists who predict a soft landing, have unemployment around 4.5% by the end of 2024. So we're gonna be in this sluggish period for a while.",

But when you listen to professionals, their level of accuracy is pretty high.\n\nWe have just now fallen into the normal distribution of recession timeline from when the yield curve first inverted.  The meat of the bell curve is basically the next 6 months.  Also the most predictive and accurate predictor of hard landing recessions is the SLOOS report that shows the tightness/looseness of bank lending.  The banks only became super tight in March.  The lag on that to recession is usually about 6 months without fail.  So anyone who knows what they are talking about would have only recently started predicting recession and would be predicting it for Q3 of this year.",

Then comes corona and extreme moneyprinting giving us inflation. But I think the deflation processes never went away. It's still there plugging along in the background and picking up speed.\n\nWe'll probably see inflation going towards deflation soon and the fed lowering rates. The economic system is more resilient and chaotic than we give it credit.\n\nBut these are just my layman theories :)",

Who is leading the charge? Companies like nvidia, and faang companies. Innovators like Elon and Mark...these people lead the charge. They are adapting to the current economical situation, and i believe other businesses will follow. The american people are adapting as well, and i think things will slowly improve going forward. It's not that nobody has any money. People aren't used to seeing such high interest rates so we Americans are currently pouting. I believe this initial shock factor will fade away, along with the continued rising of the rates, and things will slowly improve. Just my opinion anyhow",

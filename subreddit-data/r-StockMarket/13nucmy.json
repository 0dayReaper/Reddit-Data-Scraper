When it comes to fiscal responsibility, the global economy has largely been playing fast and loose for for a long time.  Sure, it can continue in perpetuity with indefinite debt limit increases, but much like the average US Consumer at the micro level who is eyeballs deep in all-time-high debt, governments at the macro level are doing the same.\n\nThis isn't a speculation of whether or not the US will raise the debt ceiling in the next couple of weeks, because I have no idea.  But I also consider the fact that past impactful events happened unexpectedly and for the first time in history.  The phrase, \"They've always raised it,\" is destined at some point to become untrue.  \n\nAgain, no speculation here.  I'm going to hedge as I deem appropriate according to my risk tolerance.  I just thought the article was decently common-sense oriented and has some truth to it.",

Children being children and this isn\u2019t even close to the most childish things the children have been children about.",

Essentially they already voted yes to spending the money. After they made this agreement republicans are threatening to no longer pay for what they agreed so they can hold the economy hostage for other negotiations. \n\nChoosing to not raise the debt limit does not mean that we will spend less money, and that we will have a true limit to our spending, it means we will default, wreck our economy, and still have to pay for everything because those bills had already been passed by congress.\n\nThe entire concept of a debt ceiling is stupid and we should just spend less when we\u2019re voting on where to spend our money, not throw a tantrum when you actually just have outstanding bills to pay.",

The US Treasury relates the two, however, albeit to assist in general understanding.  \n\n\"The national debt is composed of distinct types of debt, similar to an individual whose debt may consist of a mortgage, car loan, and credit cards. The different types of debt include non-marketable or marketable securities and whether it is debt held by the public or debt held by the government itself (known as intragovernmental).\"\n\nNow to your point, there is an inverse correlation to consumer debt and GDP (higher consumer debt leads to higher GDP) according to many studies.  And I recognize that Debt to GDP is a better indicator of the overall health of the situation.  We're aren't in dire straits yet.\n\nI believe our government *should* rein in spending, increase tax, or some combination of the two.",

In my quest to start this process, I have built a tool to visually verify key pieces of information to quickly rule out a company if its fundamentals doesn\u2019t look good. I tried many online tools but couldn\u2019t find anything which helps me easily digest the information. So, I built this tool help me visualise the earnings, compounding power, balance sheet, margins, roic, dividends, share buybacks etc on a single page to make this process much simpler. Posting the link here in case others find it helpful. Link: https://roce.app The website might not look polished since I recently started working on it.\nThe exchanges available are: NYSE, NASDAQ, NSE, TSX, LSE. You\u2019ll need the full ticket for supported international exchanges, example: \u201cDGE.L\u201d or \u201cFFH.TO\u201d or \u201cITC.NS\u201d.\n\nNote: This tool is not for thorough analysis but is intended for quickly looking at the key pieces of information to help understand if a company is worth spending more time to dig into the details.\n\nI recently shared this in value investing group and based on the response, I feel it might be helpful to broader audience.\n\nLink: https://roce.app",

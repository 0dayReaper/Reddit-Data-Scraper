It\u2019s a fallacy. \n\nThe bet that US stocks only go up is because or the strength in our economy and position as a global power, which happens to be pretty strong since the rest of the world got smothered into pieces in WW2. \n\nHistorically, betting against the US economy has been a bad bet. But that doesn\u2019t mean bets against the economy in the past were not seen as bad bets when they were placed. If Germans got to Nuclear bombs before the US did it would have been a great bet, and that was a pretty close race all things considered.\n\nEdit: downvote all you want, this fallacy is well documented. Google hot-hand\u2019s fallacy",

(no that most likely isn't true for rwandas stock market, but a hypothetical example)\n\nnot to say that reading graphs like that has any real merit, as i'm not one of those people who religiously follow TA, BUT, looking at trends can give you a good indication of if the company/economy is sound, in the long run, based on how they have been able to do historically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm also not one to follow EMH, so maybe that's where we split, but EMH doesn't claim the markets are like that either, I think you're more a random walk theory kind of guy, i'd assume which I think has been disproven many times.",

To quote Jeremy Siegel in Stocks for the Long Run, \u201cSince stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets - assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce - one should expect their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation\u201d. This is backed up by empirical data in the book. Over short time periods though (1-3 years), stocks are not a good hedge against inflation (for various reasons). But over a time period such as that presented here, it doesn\u2019t impact real returns.",

When companies are taxed higher and have less cash flow, they have less money to reinvest for growth. Then there comes a point when they eliminate jobs due to lack of growth. It is allowing the government to take their money (and ours) and choosing how they would like to spend it. There is nothing dramatic about it.

    "postText": "You cant even post about moderate gains without some fanatic or social justice warrior trying to tell you that you are a \"paper handed bitch\" or that you \"turned your back on the movement\". What fucking movement?! Stocks are not a movement. What happened with the meme stocks is not a movement. It's a bunch of idiots who got too greedy and in turn attracted a larger group of idiots who think putting $100 into a fractional share is going to bankrupt all the large players and change the way capital is dispersed to the people. Get your head out of your ass. You didn't even bankrupt 1 hedge fund. You just forced them to close their position and borrow from their friends. I hope these people go back to r/charity or r/socialjustice or where ever they usually bitch and moan about not knowing how to make money. r/investing r/stocks r/stockmarket are for investing and trading not for furthering your cause or political beliefs. That's it. GL making that paper guys.\n\nEdit: For those who are upset about my inclusion of r/socialjustice and r/charity I will admit It was an uncalled for jab at them and I do appreciate the work they do. I am actually upset about those false, fake, or wannabee, sjw's acting like this is a movement we are all a part of or even wanted to be involved in when they really just wanted to see meme stocks get them rich quick.\n\nEdit 2: For anyone who is new to trading and looking to learn more I would like to direct you to the following educational sources:-Most Brokers have excellent educational resources on their platforms when it comes to the basics.-Investopedia has articles and educational resources on most charts, technical analysis, trading strategies, and techniques. [https://www.investopedia.com/](https://www.investopedia.com/)The subs bot also provided me with these: [https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#getting-started](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#getting-started)\n\nEdit 3: Hey all, This was really fun chatting and arguing with you all. I tried to answer every comment and now I'm gonna call it because at this point most of the comments are just angry kids yelling at me for being paper handed or a whiney bitch. So have a great day &amp; good luck on your future trades!\n\nDisclaimer: None of my comments should be considered financial advice.",

True GME short squeeze zealots that still believe in 'the cause'.

Basically because I saw normal people completely disrupting an institution I thought was bulwarked against everything but the most severe events.\n\nSo I think it cuts both ways. To the people that bought in and rocketed up, good for you, you basically won the lottery. For those that mortgaged their house to pay $300 a share in a stock that had been at sub 10 bucks for years and lost it all, well I don\u2019t think you need to be a financial advisor to have seen that coming.\n\nBut to everyone else, I am really enjoying talking to you on here, listening, watching videos, and learning what my personal tolerance is. GME will blow over, but I hope it\u2019s spurred some more serious interest in others as it did in me. Heck I made 40 bucks so far, time to soup salad and breadsticks it up! Lol",

Price way overshot that, indicating that it's a bubble whether it be from the short squeeze or pump and dump disguised as that.

You can't place blame on an entire subreddit for the action of individuals, mostly whom are new, that have no idea what they are doing, talking about or even know anything about trading. They are just jumping on the bandwagon like most of Reddit usually does.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I think this overall will be a good thing. A ton of young people just got interested in investing for the first time. Once a lot of the steam from GME &amp; AMC has blown over a lot of people will get bored but the ones who are serious about trading will stick around and I think it will overall grow many smaller trading communities.\n\nMy question for you is where is your proposed solutions? I am seeing a laundry list of complaints but not a single way of how to deal with the problem.",

If you take into account their actual failure to delivers (instead of net), from what I was reading the float goes up to some insane number, something like 300% short sold with enough FTDs to ordinarily be an issue but because there is a positive net, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s undetectable until well after a series of FTDs happens. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but that can easily put a hedge fund in trouble. It\u2019s not because they shorted a stock that they got into a lot of trouble - it\u2019s because they shorted it by something like 300% (shorted 3x as many shares as exist)\n\nNo wonder they\u2019re hurting.\n\nBut that said, trying to boil the ocean is never a good idea. The paper hands thing is dumb - if you no longer want to assume a risk, then why not sell? Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you - emotions have no place in day trading IMO.",

The last thing I wanted was a V shaped recovery and that's what we got and then some.

The idea of batteries is to democratize the power grid while adding to the overall optimization of the grid. We lose so much energy due to the transmission and voltage sag as load increases. Normalizing that load by using distributed batteries reduces the overall loss of energy produced, which means less nuclear required. A mix of both technologies would be ideal, that is until we get nuclear advancements for safe portable micro nuclear reactors. That would be the ultimate endgame move if a reactor was the size of a car battery.",

I took the plunge and read some of the academic literature on this a year or two back when I was looking at buying some Uranium stocks. The estimates for cost of new nuclear facilities are given as ranges, and those ranges span an entire order of magnitude, which is just insane for a cost estimate.\n\nThe problem is that nuclear has been out of favor for quite some time now, starting in the 90's and accelerating after Fukushima. Consequently, the supply chain for building new nuclear facilities, and even repairing existing facilities, is heavily constrained. For many key components there is literally only one or two firms on the planet capable of producing the required materials. When one firm has a monopoly on a supply chain, we all know what that does to costs. So the big question for nuclear is this: if investment opened back up again, and the markets in the supply chain became more competitive, what would prices look like then?\n\nThe answer is: we don't know. There's only one way to find out.\n\nThis is why it is so hard to argue with people on Reddit about nuclear (I've tried). People who hate nuclear will quote cost numbers from the upper end of the range, while people who love it will quote from the bottom end, and neither party is necessarily wrong, because we are dealing with a situation involving *uncertainty*.",

Also, looks like any time anyone says the blame isn't only on Russia, they stick their fingers in their ears and just don't read the rest of it at all, lmao. 99% of people don't know who Zelenski is and how he got to be the president, what his Olygarch friend did to his own country and instead of being a criminal, he is a fucking celebrity now and Kyiv is a clown parade. I feel bad for the Ukrainian and European people for being betrayed like that by our leaders and I feel bad for everyone who can't recognize that. I understand it's an unpopular opinion due to people not knowing the situation and believing everything they read online by western media, but c'mon, just do some research, just check what Zelenski is saying in the past months and anyone normal will understand that the guy completely lost it. But instead, Ukraine good, Russia bad, that's all you guys will ever understand, fuck it...",

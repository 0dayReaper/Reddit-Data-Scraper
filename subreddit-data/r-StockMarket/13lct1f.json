How are they selected for that position and who determines their qualifications? The FDA and SEC both oversee industries that they were and will be making money in once their appointments are up. \n\nIsn\u2019t that a conflict of interest? I can\u2019t think of a single oversight board or committee that doesn\u2019t fall prey to nepotism or other issues like that. I don\u2019t think having a government oversight committee is the panacea you think it\u2019d be. At least not in the manner they\u2019re used or staffed currently.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure all of the companies who made this decision are publicly traded. That means if they do make any profit from this they\u2019ll essentially release that information in their earnings reports right? \n\nThat\u2019s probably a much faster, more efficient, and less complicated way of getting the information you\u2019re talking about rather than submitting a FOIA request and having everything redacted or just not answered due to the request not being specific enough etc.",

He's basically getting to be the banker in monopoly and use the bank as his personal funds. \n\nSo yes, someone else needs to do it if you at all want a \"more fair\" game to be played.

I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re totally impartial, but my understanding is they decided it didn\u2019t meet the criteria for a payout based on the actual contracts of the CDS. \n\nThe swaps stipulated they would pay out in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy and wouldn\u2019t pay out in the case of government seizure which is what happened. \n\nIf you had money in a money market fund that broke the buck and never recovered, you wouldn\u2019t be covered by FDIC or SIPC if the brokerage didn\u2019t go completely under. Is that fair? I guess? Maybe not? I don\u2019t know. Where does personal responsibility on calculated risks end and it becomes something else? I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a question that can be answered in a Reddit thread.\n\nBut most people still see that as a remote risk so they park their money there. Is it the broker\u2019s fault, the investors, or the government\u2019s if the fund never recovers? It\u2019s essentially the same with these swaps. If they\u2019d agreed to a pay out there\u2019d be posts about crony capitalism etc. But since they actually followed the wording of the contracts they\u2019re foxes in the hen house? \n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

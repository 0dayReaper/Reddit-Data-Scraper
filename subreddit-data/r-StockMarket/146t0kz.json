They may not be immediately obvious, but businesses like Marriott, Comcast, or Verizon could benefit from automating customer support, resulting in substantial cost savings. Just as a few examples. \n\nSimilarly, a company like Salesforce, which heavily invests in human administrators and developers, have the potential to automate numerous tasks through A.I. Data entry and reporting, once performed manually by Salesforce Admins, can now be automated with A.I., offering faster and more accurate and consistent results. Honestly the entire role of Salesforce Admin is dying out.",

AI is not going to be doing actual work tasks any time soon, it\u2019s just a personal assistant that makes workers much more efficient by writing/editing for them, summarizing things like long email threads, and more specific things like answer devs questions about libraries and errors, take care of simple support, and much more. Pretty much all big companies including mine have their own internal ChatGPT contract with openAI. It\u2019s also getting more integrated and better every day for each company\u2019s internal systems. The substantial value is already here. AI technology as it is right now brings massive value.",

Experience has shown that taking it gradually, over the period when people are paid, generally 2 weeks or a month, the people can absorb some price change shock and keep going.\n\nThe problem is corporations run on the fear that Wall St. will yank their chain and send their stock price plummeting. This influences corporate leadership in bad ways and it shows the unappealing level of control that a handful of people on Wall St. (fictional as Hollywood these days of international communications) has over America.

Everyone around here sees Target as a Bitchy white girl store and that\u2019s not adding in pride onesies (what in the absolute fuck). Ya\u2019ll need to choose your higher ups better. Add in the delivery service and/or pickup. Walmart\u2019s (Spark) is doing just fine, can\u2019t speak for Target\u2019s (still using doordash I\u2019m guessing?) but I know that and adding a grocery section has been the focus at our local Target. I will admit it looks nice, but I don\u2019t need a fancier / more expensive Walmart and I don\u2019t need a pride onesie for my kid.",

There is the argument though that if they simply do what Walmart does, why go to Target? Walmart already exists.\n\nBut we do stupid shit like have our Spring collection include $90 plastic plants\u2026 Walmart has a garden center. I cannot for the life me understand how we completely skip out on garden when gardens are a huge part of local culture in the summer throughout most of the northern and western US. I don\u2019t shop at Walmart due to hating my job there before grad school, but when I get lawn and garden stuff at Ace or Lowe\u2019s I always get some other stuff for power tools or supplies. Its an easy way to get people in the door. I imagine Walmart gets a lot of sales that same way.\n\nI won\u2019t touch on the Pride stuff because I already noted that sales cratered before that and it\u2019s become a low IQ excuse Target leadership can bring out to mask glaring issues with fundamentals. Walmart issued a Pride collection last weekend and no one gave a fuck. Its not a real issue affecting the stock, just noise",

Recessions are part of the game in market economies, and there are tons of factors that can trigger them. Central banks can cushion the blow, sure, but they can't eliminate the risk entirely.  \n\n\nAnd yeah, the 2008 mess was brutal, but not all recessions are cut from the same cloth. Each one's got its own backstory and unique quirks. Anyway, just some food for thought.",

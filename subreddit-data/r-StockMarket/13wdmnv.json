Fund managers also trade \"more intelligently\" than average Joe. Doesn't mean they are good at it nor does it mean average person is good at stock market either.\n\nOne more point I forgot to touch on, trading is not as likely to eventually make money, unlike regular investing in ETFs. You can lose 100% of capital trading, chances are you won't lose ever 100% capital \\*INVESTING\\* in SNP500 or World ETF.",

It's just they used the hype of ChatGPT and OpenAI and just cashed in on the AI buzzword on Q report hype for extra stock riling.\n\nBiggest irony is, NVIDIA actually made major advancements in AI themselves well prior to this with their DLSS, which actually should have given them more stock than it initially did, but people were hung up on AMD aggressive pricing and the fact they were on 5nm chipsets and in years of dominance finally someone was catching up to NVIDIA.\n\nPeople are now acting like this is gonna be an revolution, when in reality the hype is gonna die down in 3 months, especially since this is not some co-research AI deal, they are simply selling the product at a good rate to a hyped industry and regardless of all this  NVIDIA will continue growing with a steady trend because it's a good company with strong position overall in a market that will continue needing steady supply of GPUs with growing rates, but acting like this is some AI rocketship that changes the game is ridiculous",

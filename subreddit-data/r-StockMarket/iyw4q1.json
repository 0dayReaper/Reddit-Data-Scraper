    "postText": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/23/mark-cuban-americans-should-get-a-1000-dollar-stimulus-check-every-2-weeks.html\n\nCuban says that all American households, no matter their income level, should receive a $1,000 stimulus check every two weeks for the next two months. He proposed this same idea in May and says \"I still believe in doing it the exact same way\" today.\n\nAdditionally, families would have to spend each check within 10 days, or they would lose the money, Cuban says. He believes this \"use it or lose it approach\" would be beneficial because it would promote spending, which would help businesses stay open and stimulate the economy.\n\nWithout mandating the money be spent within 10 days of receipt, Cuban believes many Americans will save it. \"People are uncertain about their future, so rather than spending, they save,\" he says. He has a point: Many Americans have been saving more amid the pandemic than ever. In April, the personal savings rate hit a record high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThanks for the awards.",

I still haven't gotten the tax return I filed in March because I had to do a one page paper supplement and they can't even keep up with what they're supposed to do, they're months behind on tax returns ffs. \n\nNo way they could track something of this scope. Best bet would be to give everyone debit cards but with the efficiency of the government we will get them in 2023.",

Certainly beats having cash in your home lol. \n\n\n\nYou know what, her using that money to buy physical gold bars and store them in a lockbox at the bank would be a great move. It would keep her money safer, in a liquid asset that is protected from inflation and the devaluation of the dollar, both are inevitabilities in the coming decade. Win win I think\n\n\nAlternatively, invest in GLD etf in Cashapp",

There will definitely be fraud if this is done, but I assume they just want to get people to spend money in whatever way they can to stimulate the economy, along with assisting people with paying rent and food, etc. \n\nSame with pre-covid, if people want to spend their money on stupid shit they can deal with the consequences and we won\u2019t bail them out anymore after such generous assistance (you know tons of dipshits will buy uglyass Louis Vuitton or whatever ugly trendy item the rappers are wearing). They\u2019d most likely just have to focus on outright illegal things like drugs, human trafficking, and firearms, but I think they can avoid stipulating exactly what you do with the money in this case, at least to a point. Circulating more money among the people rather than putting it into Fortune 500s\u2019 bank accounts and stocks is far better for everyone.",

I was actually saying that 1k IS a lot of money to people. To force them to spend it in 10 days seems a little absurd.  I'm sure Cuban drops 1k at dinner.\n\nAlso, yes, 100% agree 2k a month is poverty wages.  This is not a comparison to a living wage, this is extra money Cuban wants the government to send to people to just go out and spend, and force them to do it in a very limited amount of time.",

Sure, an argument can be made that those with higher incomes have higher costs but that amount of money no longer holds as much weight compared to their overall spending and the local economies of higher income areas are suffering less in comparison to low income areas anyway.\n\nNow you can debate the actual implementation, income thresholds, etc. Thats valid to critique because theres no exact answers, but otherwise it makes sense to give money to the lowest incomes first. Canadas unemployment rate spiked at 13.1% in May and has been steadily falling since (currently 10.9%) people are returning to their jobs as the economy reopens and thats regardless of any emergency assistance programs, so the idea that people \"aren't returning to their shit jobs\" is just fear mongering.",

Savings, while nice, doesn't actually accomplish what the money is supposed to do.\n\nThe point is, if the people who spend money have money to spend, they will. Our savings rate, which is like at a high right now, is only about 7% of income. That means, on average, people spend 93% of their income. In order to keep the country rolling, we need to stay at around that level or else the losses ripple through the economy, resulting in a negative feedback loop where more people become unemployed, which means less spending, which means more unemployment, etc. until the government steps in.",

I've heard down south they're still like $3-5 a pack. Now take NYC who has like $10 a pack as a STARTING point. That's double the price in the south. Same goes for real estate - if you're in a state with a housing crisis, it will slowly make its way throughout the state and change prices everywhere.\n\nBut yeah, rent, car payments, mortgage, bills... For parents add kids on top of that (although having kids was on them) $1k is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things, and that's coming from somebody who is ecstatic to find a penny on the sidewalk",

In April, the personal savings rate hit a record high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nOof, imagine being poor and told not to save. I think this dystopian break from reality shows the true knowledge of the rich. People aren't saving because the WANT to, they are saving because the HAVE to, hard to get car work done when the avg cost is 3 months revenue for the average American. Hell, hard to own a car when a new car cost three to four years untaxed pay.",

These people are not 'saving' the money as it is. They are the ones who truly NEED the money to keep the lights on, rent paid, daycare paid, and car running for example.\n\nThe 'expiration date' on these checks would really only affect the affluent, those unaffected by job/income loss, or those who don't actually need the money period. These are the people saving and not rolling the money back into the economy. So these people will spend the money on things they otherwise wouldn't spend money on helping to drive economic recovery.\n\nI tend to agree with him here.\n\nOn a personal level/edit - We've been lucky enough to get this far without any sort of financial setback or job loss and aren't anticipating it. We also were one of the ones who saved 100% of the money received by the stim check as a 'just in case'.\n\nIf we were forced to spend future payments or lose it? You bet your ass i'm using that money to take care of the 'honey do' list of shit I really do not want to do around the house. Lawn debris/leaf removal, snow plowing, landscaping, sealing the driveway, repainting the trim on the house, etc. And I guess that's sort of the point.",

    "postText": " I know a lot of people are going to boo me for this, but the AI hype is real. Sure, there are shysters and garbage companies out there ~~paying lawyers~~ using Chat GPT to draw up the paperwork to go public and fleece the greedy and the ignorant. But the changes AI is bringing to the world are going to be more bigger, more fundamentally daily life changing, and faster than all the changes that happened during the Information Age.  \n\n\nThe real key to understanding what a watershed moment Chat GPT and other generative AI technology out there to the general public is this:  \n\n\nThe information age brought about **sharing information** at 0 marginal cost.   \n\n\nThe AI age is bringing about **generation of knowledge** at 0 marginal cost.  \n\n\nGo ahead and tell me, \"AI can't do anything, it can only rearrange things.\" or \"Yeah, but it isn't 100% right all the time.\" First, that's what humans do. Second, when are humans 100% right all the time anyway? Whether or not AI is generating original information doesn't really belong in this sub. But **it is uncontestable that AI can generate new information right now.** \n\nOver time, AI will get better and genuinely produce new knowledge. But the producing of new knowledge isn't the earth shattering part. I can go out and make a baby with someone and essentially create a new data processing machine. The revolutionary part, **the truly revolutionary part is that you can build these machine minds to solve problems for you at scale.**\n\nGo listen to the $NVDA call and you'll hear NVDA explain that businesses are buying chips to build out these scalable machine brains. Remember all those conference calls where companies were saying \"AI\" on their calls to get a stock price boost?\n\nWas some of it nonsense? Yes.\n\nHowever, **we're about an earnings season or two away from one of those companies who said they were using new AI tech to improve their business to announce that it actually worked.** There is going to be one company, the first company that goes on their earnings call and says \"Due to AI we have unexpectedly high profits and are raising full year guidance.\" \n\n**That will be the tipping point, and it is as few as 3 months away.**\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend to know which company is going to make that announcement. I don't. Nor do I have the time to sift through enough earnings calls to figure it out, though I wish I did. It's going to be a company with obvious uses for AI, and probably more focused on a company who that uses lots of brainpower like an engineering or coding company. Possibly something in the service sector.\n\nThe moment corporate America figures out how to do significantly more with significantly less labor by using AI, it will. And GDP is going to explode.\n\nThere have been so many ideas and \"revolutions\" that were going to change everything. They all promised that change was just around the corner.   \n\n\nThe AI boom is different. It is the real deal, and we're going to see an economic and stock market bonanza that will likely never be repeated in our lifetimes.",

                            "comment": "I've asked ChatGTP \"What do investors say prior to a stock market bubble?\"\n\nThis is his answer:\n\nInvestors' sentiments and opinions can vary greatly prior to a stock market bubble, and it's important to note that not all investors will express the same views. However, here are some common statements or beliefs that investors might express or encounter in the period leading up to a stock market bubble:\n\n1. \"This time is different\": Investors may believe that the market has entered a new era or paradigm shift, making traditional indicators or valuation metrics less relevant. They may argue that technological advancements, regulatory changes, or other factors have fundamentally altered the investment landscape.\n2. \"The market will keep going up\": Investors may become overly optimistic and believe that the upward trend in stock prices will continue indefinitely. They may dismiss signs of overvaluation or ignore potential risks, assuming that any market correction will be short-lived or insignificant.\n3. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\": Some investors may perceive an extraordinary opportunity for massive gains and fear missing out on potential profits. This fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to increased speculative behavior and a willingness to take on higher levels of risk.\n4. \"Valuations don't matter anymore\": Investors might downplay the importance of traditional valuation measures, such as price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios. They may argue that new valuation models or metrics should be used to justify high stock prices, often relying on future growth prospects or non-financial factors.\n5. \"Everyone is making money\": As the market euphoria builds, investors may feel encouraged by stories of friends, colleagues, or acquaintances making substantial profits in the market. This \"herd mentality\" can contribute to a sense of invincibility and encourage more investors to join the speculative frenzy.\n6. \"I can't lose\": Overconfidence can take hold as investors experience a series of successful trades or investments. This overconfidence bias can lead to increased risk-taking and a disregard for proper risk management strategies.\n7. \"Ignore the naysayers\": Skepticism or warnings from market analysts, economists, or experienced investors may be disregarded or labeled as pessimistic. Investors caught up in the excitement of a bubble may dismiss contrary opinions and choose to focus solely on bullish narratives.\n\nIt's important to recognize that these statements are not necessarily accurate or indicative of the market's future trajectory. Bubbles are characterized by irrational exuberance and a detachment from fundamental realities, which can lead to significant market corrections or crashes when sentiment eventually shifts. Prudent investors should remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with their risk tolerance and investment goals.",

Critics might argue that there is no clear need for the innovation or that existing solutions are sufficient.\r  \n\r  \n\"It's not fundamentally changing anything\": Critics might not see how this innovation will alter existing processes or systems.

Personally the way I see it AI is a real thing and it is important and integral to advancing our future in many ways, however I also believe this is a bubble, because in the end companies will look to use AI to increase efficiency, and that will likely lead to job losses. Unless we as a society can come up with other jobs for the masses that get displaced then this technology will be like shooting yourself in the foot; because without jobs and income our economy and the profits of our public companies is unsustainable.\n\nBest of luck, but I do believe this will return to the mean.",

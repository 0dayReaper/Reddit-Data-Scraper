    "postText": "Lets get this out of the way, I have no idea where the market is headed, but it does seem like we are getting a little too greedy, a little too quickly: \n\n$QQQ has a return of \\~33% YTD, and we are ONLY 5-months into the year!  If it stays flat for the next 7-months, it will be QQQs 6th best returning year EVER! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t89glpegv03b1.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cbb128b9c4b5e74a6e18b8bb54d9d30ce21a07c3\n\nI have no idea if this will continue or not, but what are your thoughts, are we expecting this run to continue, have a pull back, or flatten out?  Curious what everyones thoughts are, especially with student debt payments restarting very soon, and what the impact (if any) will be on the markets?",

Value stocks cutting dividends left and right and getting pummeled, growth stocks that don\u2019t make money getting pummeled and the only thing going up is MegaCaps and they are all at or near ATHs. I would rather hit some of these stocks at multi year lows right before the holidays ( which is when my Puts I sold expire ) than buy anything right now. We are in the full on FOMO phase of the market. Selling Puts on value stocks at multi year lows is the best strategy right now",

Parks &amp; classic movie franchises, sports, streaming (66% hulu/espn/disney+).  CVS is much better than rite aid or walgreens its not close my opinion and they are transitioning to a real health care company with their recent purchases of oak street health and signify. Target has lots of competition i understand this with walmart &amp; amazon but i feel like target has a massive fan base and will do just fine. My experience, shopping at target is much more pleasant than walmart.",

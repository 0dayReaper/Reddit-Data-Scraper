I have been struggling to find a comprehensive and trustworthy platform or provider that offers this level of granularity. I've tried various avenues, but it seems harder to come by than I initially thought.\n\nI am specifically interested in obtaining historical data for equities, and I need it to be as detailed as possible, with second-by-second resolution. While I'm open to paid options, I'd also appreciate any suggestions for free sources if available.\n\nIf any of you have experience or knowledge in this area, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations, insights, and tips. It would be incredibly helpful if you could share any platforms, providers, or sources that offer historical equity data with second-by-second resolution, along with any relevant information about their pricing, data quality, and user experience.\n\nLong story short I just need historical stock data with a second by second resolution.",

If you're utilizing the resources needed to evaluate such big data, put it to better use.",

The future of big data in markets is there, not really in \"back testing\" etc.",

But some data providers offer real-time paid data feed, for example IEX Cloud. Maybe it possible to buy historical data or receive an expert answer for this questions from them.",

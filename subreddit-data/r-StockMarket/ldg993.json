Four example according to the Classic Car Club of America, a car is classic if it was made between 1915 and 1948, and it takes into consideration the brand of the car, the model, the coach that build the car (Fleewood, Murphy, Pininfarina, etc), the number of car that were build and so on. For example, a Chevrolet from 1928, is not a classic car because it was mass produce, while a Cadillac v12,v16 are full classic because they were build in low quantity. But there are brand that doesn't matter the amount of car that were build, are 100% Classic, an example would be RR, Alfa Romeo, Minerva (except the 4 cylinder), Mercedes (before 1927), Benz( also from before 1927), Mercedes-Benz( 1927 model until 1948). Here you can find a list of the approve Classic Cars by the CCCA ( Classic Club Car of America) [https://www.classiccarclub.org/approved-classics](https://www.classiccarclub.org/approved-classics)",

Our local hospital is one of 25 RCT sites and has literally brought people back from death's door with this therapeutic given intravenously.  Inhaler studies are commencing at University of California Irvine for mild Covid cases (and to prevent progression) and a nasal spray shows good results to prevent Keytruda pneumonitis. I think the spray will be eventually trialed to clear up Covid fog and forgetfullness via cranial nerves 1 and 5 transferring aviptadil directly into the brain bypassing blood brain barrier...the same way Covid 19 gets into the brain.

Take your bags elsewhere.\n\nI use Pharmaceuticals as a bit of a canary in the coal mine for the end of a bear market. For the first time since 2021 Pharma has signaled that the bear market may be at an end.\n\nI use ABBV as my go to, I think it's one of the strongest Pharmas without too many legal headaches which is a rare combination considering the field.\n\nPharma and Utilities are usually the last to \"puke\" in a bear market. In every major bear market back to the 1970s, they typically held their gains through the entirety of the bear market, then puked sometimes dumping 50% after everything else had long bottomed. It's a weird phenomenon for those two sectors.\n\nThere's a \"bull trend line\" formed by the covid era that ABBV respected until this week. Thus, it has finally \"puked\".\n\nHow hard it will dump is yet to be seen. The final test for the bear market is for the SPX to retest the 200week which will be somewhere around SPX 3900 in October which is 80% of the time the typical retest zone where everyone starts to feel the burn and panic.\n\n80% of bear markets waterfall down in that period due to it being the end Fiscal Calendar cycle.\n\nSo I fully expect we'll see SPX 3900 again some point by then. Pharma and utilities are usually the best buys in decades when they hit that bottom while an already 'recovering market' has began its climb and is retesting the 200week.\n\nSo if anyone's interested in Pharma, I'd star watching but not buying yet.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/4LSgPAOI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4LSgPAOI/)",

They have no savings and are barely making it work, but they\u2019ve squeezed together a couple hundred and put it into a meme stock instead of using it to protect themselves and to solve their financial emergency.\n\nI think it\u2019s awesome if someone can use a hyped stock to make some money. That\u2019s absolutely a good thing.\n\nBut I think a lot of people are treating this as more a sure thing than it actually is. They\u2019re hyper focused on putting their tiny buying power into the market to try to make it big, instead of putting that focus to work for them.\n\nBuild a skill, get some training, tackle an education. Start properly earning. Then emergency savings, basic retirement contributions, additional savings first. Then disposable into hand picks.\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit disheartening to hear people talk about their investment like it\u2019s the thing that\u2019s going to change their lives. It sounds exactly like the type of conversation you overhear from blue collar workers buying their weekly lottery tickets.",

Many ways you just have to find the one that works for you. For me it is around 60% long stocks I try to never sell maybe buy some puts from time to time if I feel a short term pull back. Cash them out and buy more of the stock at the lower price. Always reinvest dividends. Then around 20% in what I call swing trades that could last 3-4 weeks to 2-3+ months. The final 20% I use for short term. usually less then 2-3 weeks and daily at times. If i see a possible catalyst or something that is so under valued or over valued I will buy or sell a position with stock and options. Additionally, I max my 401K every paycheck. It really is the best way to become wealthy along with your career. A lot easier then running a business.... I stress to work as well. Don't just stay home and trade/invest. For me it helps keep a respect for so called paper money and reminds me how hard it is to make money so don't take oversized risky chances. The most important thing to remember if you think you missed out on an easy trade. Let it Go!!! There is always another one around the corner. Stay with it... nothing good in life is easy.... ;-)",

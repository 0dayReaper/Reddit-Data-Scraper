At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\"\n\n&gt;They launder it through the stock market mainly. We\u2019ve all heard by now how people like Nancy Pelosi make $200,000 ish a year but are worth $100 million plus correct?\n\nNo that's called insider trading. Those are personal funds they use and I don't believe that at any point Nancy wrote a check to Zelensky to hide her stock gains. Maybe take *one* economics class. Just one. \n\n&gt;The $400 billion was just an exaggeration, for awhile it seemed like they were trying to send them $50 billion a week. The real number was $75B,\n\n\"Ok I lied about that huge number. It *seemed* like this much smaller number. It's actually a tiny fraction of that smaller number.\" \n\nDude. What on earth did you just make me read? \n\n&gt;The shit happening at the border is not a joke, I\u2019ve heard most people up north don\u2019t even know about it which is mind blowing how bad the media portrays it in other states\n\nWe have the internet.

It's comical watching you get defensive and using lame insults like \"little boy\" when your obvious BS is noticed.\n\nDoes this happen every 1-2 years? No. No, it does not. Maybe you're really young. I don't know. But it's clear your knowledge on this subject is low. Go read and educate yourself on the history of the debt ceiling. \n\nYou'll quickly realize that what's happening isn't historically normal. Really. It'll take ten minutes of your life.\n\nEDIT: Guess ten minutes is too much reading",

It\u2019s not.  It\u2019s dumb.  And luckily people see through it.  There\u2019s no play here, just Republicans trying to cut social assistance programs that they promised they wouldn\u2019t cut.",

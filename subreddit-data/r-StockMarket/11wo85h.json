These banks would all pass a stress test or at least what has been presented so far. This is a very basic issue driven by rising rates causing paper losses. Some very poorly run companies put all their working capital in one account so once banks ran through their cash they needed to sell their treasuries (safest investment in the world) at a loss to fund these withdraws.\n\nAgain, nothing about the rollback of regs would have prevented this.",

US Treasuries are great investments if you hold them to maturity. But people panicked because rates went up and market value of the bonds dropped, so they went to get their money and the banks were forced to sell the bonds at market value for a loss. If people hadn't panicked we wouldn't be in this situation. But unfortunately it's the prisoner's dilemma because it's in *our* best interest to stay calm, but it's in *my* best interest to get my money. And you can't expect people to not act in self interest",

Anyone thinking that Janet Yellen has a point and that we can somehow magically prevent an economic crisis for a whole \"lifetime\" just because of regulations put in place after 2008 is extremely naive. The deregulation people keep quoting isn't the cause of the current financial crisis (or non-crisis, it's too early to say) it only increased the likelihood of such a crisis occuring earlier.\n\n And saying that no one could of predicted the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine is also just simply wrong. The WHO was holding conferences about the high likelihood of an upcoming pandemic back in the mid 2010s, Bill Gates predicted it in 2018. And major Foreign Policy actors predicted the Russians would invade Ukraine already back when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Partnership for Peace fell. Just because you as a common individual were ignorant of these things does not excuse major players in the government like the TREASURY SECRETARY of the US from being ignorant.. and they wouldn't be, they just chose to ignore the warnings.",

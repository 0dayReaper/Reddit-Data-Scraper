Don't only hold stocks, crypto, hedge funds. The reason being is that if some event happens to bring the market down, all your stocks may be affected at once. \n\nHave some money in savings, some in secured credit cards, treasury bonds, physical assets ECT.. Building your wealth comes in many forms not just a large stock portfolio. Figure out what can you invest in which can keep paying you regularly. \n\n*Example: you buy a cozy beautiful plot of land, you rent it out for camping so it regularly pays you after your initial investment has been paid back.\n\n*Spend the interest never the principal which is why you must maintain some form of liquidity to \"buy\" you what I call \"Financial Patience\"  or the ability to not have to prematurely pull out your investments. \n\nOne more piece of info you may want to look into:\n\n*If you have money in your stocks and get into a situation where you have to cash out all your net worth to pay for an unforeseen event, assets can help you build your cash base back up. They are your \"time multipliers\"",

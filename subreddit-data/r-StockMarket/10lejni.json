In attempts to make sure no one can find the money he has made Saul Goodman (lawyer) sends Huel and another guy (cant think of his name right now) to a storage unit, where Walt's wife was storing the cash, to discreetly collect all of Walt's money. This is the scene in the storage unit. The money had been stacked in a neat square pile. Huel looks at it and says \"I gotta do it man\" and lays on the pile of cash.",

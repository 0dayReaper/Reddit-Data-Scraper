They have a long delay before reporting (iirc only after end of every quarter), and the punishments for failing to report are embarrassingly low compared to the profit a lot of them are making. In theory they could sell or short after the time frame they\u2019re required to report and then tank the market. They wouldn\u2019t be required to report it until it\u2019s said and done.\n\nThat said, my feeling is that this is all overblown. Defaulting isn\u2019t just a threat to the market, it\u2019s a threat to the dollar and could have a massive longstanding effect on the economy and power of the US. They\u2019re not going to risk their wealth or power over the policies they\u2019re pushing for. But they want *us* to think they *might* so they can pressure Biden into compromise.\n\nWe honestly shouldn\u2019t let this happen and should do away with the debt ceiling just like virtually every other country, but I don\u2019t think that will happen in my lifetime because it\u2019s been so successful for one party.",

Trump even took to Twitter to whip Republican support in the House, with limited success.\n\nOnly 65 out of 197 House Republicans ended up voting for the measure, with most rejecting the pleas from Trump and their own leadership.\n\n\n       With slim majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats could have used filibuster protections afforded by congressional budget rules to hike the nation\u2019s borrowing limit without any Republican help. Instead, they zipped up their budget measure without any mention of the debt limit, effectively challenging Senate Republicans to help them avert a disaster.\n\nIn the end, both sides caved a little, joining forces to punt for two months and then to create a one-time filibuster loophole that allowed Senate Democrats to raise the cap with a simple majority vote.",

One way you can see this is government contractors are doing particularly poorly recently, suggesting investors are taking the debt ceiling as a concern but for many businesses the news is net positive. I suspect if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t risen in time a new trick will be implemented. The Fed isn\u2019t going to tank the economy by refusing the coin. Why would they? I think more likely they swap out a bunch of discount bonds for premium bonds. Most US bonds trade at a discount to there face value. Swapping those out for interest paying bonds of an equal or greater interest to current rates seems like a simple way to get around the debt ceiling.",

Hence the market is definitively pricing a very low to negligible chance of a default. It was further bolstered by Biden\u2019s speech yesterday. Debt ceiling is an issue comes up every few years, creates a tussle and then people just move on. The stock market on the other hand is going up because something like 70-80% of companies have posted an earnings surprise to the upside, inflation seems to be cooling down while interest rate hikes are projected to stop, meaning the chance of a soft landing is now looking increasingly likely.",

If you genuinely don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I would be able give you investing 101 crash course in the comments section. In that case I would suggest you stop spreading misinformation on Internet forums and start reading investing books, articles and watch good finance YouTubers.

Since the stock price is a reflection of all earnings the company is going to make in its lifetime, it makes sense that more earnings = higher stock price. When over 2/3rds of the sp500 beats the expectations, that will have a sizeable effect. You can further study the relationship between interest rate curve and it\u2019s expectations vs the stock market price using such ratios as excess CAPE yield. It might be time you started paying closer attention to the MSM.",

We\u2019re literally talking about the SP500 rally right now, trading at 17.5-18 12 month forward P/E earnings. The stock market is definitively not pricing an earnings contraction, rather an earnings expansion, so you\u2019re incorrect right off the get go. But more than that, the GDP in the USA is literally expected to grow in 2024 (about 0.9%), with a possibly one slightly negative quarter. Otherwise, there are hundreds of indicators, some of them, like the inverted interest rate curve (which I presume is what you\u2019re referring to) is pricing in an interest rate cut, that\u2019s what the inverted interest rate curve means. Interest rate cut is generally a sign of a recession, therefore it implies a recession. But as I said, it\u2019s only one of the indicators. \n\nDon\u2019t get your information from other commenters on Reddit",

Stock market can be thought of as a complex forward pricing mechanism, it is inherently forward looking. What matters in the current rally more is not that it\u2019s double the long term, but that it\u2019s lower than immediately before, and it\u2019s on the right track. Same with the GDP, it\u2019s not relevant to the current rally that GDP is expected to grow only 0.9%, which is objectively a low number, what matters is that it\u2019s higher than what was previously expected (which was lower), and since earnings are leveraged, small changes in GDP can result in very high changes in company earnings.",

They\u2019re de-risking because in case of default, interest rates will skyrocket. Increased interest rates would cause yields to increase too, reducing the value of their bonds (specifically treasuries) on hand.\n\nAnd with the liquidity (cash) that they have, the major players either invest in RRP (if the fed allows it) or equities - making equity price go up.",

Then I go to someone else and procure another $10k. I use a piece of that $10k to give you $1k and now you think you've gotten a return when in reality there's no product making any money. But since it looks like there's a 10% ROI, other people want to invest. And it continues until you either abscond to Cuba or get arrested.",

China has surpassed the US in economic output, and the government doesn't like it. They're going to keep spending to try to put us back in the #1 position even though it's a lost cause. We're gonna end up like the Soviet fucking Union trying to keep up with the Chinese. Because all we know is *more more more*. Spend more, build more, do more. Can't afford it? Borrow more and print more! Gotta look strong at all times when you're competing as a world superpower. Keep your head above water as long as possible but never let them know your body is giving out from fatigue until you start fucking drowning. What if we cut back spending, slowed down our ambitions and focused on paying debts and restenghtening the dollar? We'd look weak, like we're giving up the fight and conceding our position because we know we're not economically stong enough to keep pushing forward. At least that's how Washington sees it. Besides, you cut down spending on one program and the people get upset and the other party sees an opportunity to funnel money into a program on their agenda. The 2 parties compete to spend as much as possible on the things their voters want, because the state of this country isn't ideal for anyone except the wealthy. An administration that devotes resources towards paying debts in full is guaranteed to loose next election. I mean look at it: people in this very thread are arguing over Trump accumulating 25% of national debt in his term vs. Biden accumulating even more in his first two years. But to both sides, their guy is justified their spending. Big spending is an irrelevant issue that does nothing to dissuade a voter because  if their party is spending big, it's on things they'll benefit from, or so they believe even if only subconsciously. So the party's aren't going to change habits regardless of promises, because anyone who campaigns on the promise of \"well spend as little as possible and put as much towards the debt as we can\" is bound to lose. It's not exciting and it doesn't immediately improve anyone's quality of life. At a minimum it means 8 years of substantially less funding for everything, and more than likely it would require multiple administrations to follow through with the plan. And when the economic situation starts to deteriorate rapidly, what do you think will happen: enact an extremely strict budget (it'll be too late for that) or execute the financial escape plan when people start using dollar bills as toilet paper?\n\nSo yeah that's the feeling I'm basing this on. Also maybe I should clarify that when I say \"its never getting paid\" I mean the debt being paid off in its entirety.",

China has surpassed the US in economic output\n\nAll that is common knowledge and/or easily verifiable with a single Google search. If you've ever written a college essay you'll know that is the criteria for a factual claim to not require a reference citation.\n\n&gt;the government doesn't like it.\n\nAnalytical observation. I know it, you know it, everyone and their fucking grandmother who hasn't paid attention to politics in 40 years knows the US doesn't like being usurped. It's how people work, especially government. No source required. Why does it matter if I said it before some schmuck from Foriegn Affirs journal said it first? Read anything on the topic and you'll find this exact same sentiment regardless of political perspective, there's no need for me to direct you to some article to prove that someone else with an associates degree said the same thing I did. How are we supposed to discuss anything if you want \"a source \ud83e\udd13\" for every statement I make? And how does a source make it any less right or wrong? Be a critical thinker and judge my statements for yourself.\n\n&gt;They're going to keep spending to try to put us back in the #1 position\n\nA forecast, a prediction. *MY* prediction, how the hell do I find a source for that?

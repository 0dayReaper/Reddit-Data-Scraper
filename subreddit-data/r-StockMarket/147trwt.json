How it works is the business insiders have ownership. They find or get found by a shell company with cash that's already NASDAQ listed. They go on a road show looking for more money. The M&amp;A bank, original shell company investor's, and other investors get a deal typically less than $10 a share. The company merges and lists at a crazy valuation, offering shares typically around $10 to the public. The insiders are prevented from selling their discounted shares for a few months. The goal by the scam is to pump the stock as much as possible so they can dump when it does unlock, and pay outlandish salaries to the CEOs. E.g MULN with zero revenue paid it's CEO a 750k salary and 750k cash bonus lol. The stock was never $350. It has done multiple reverse splits so that it doesn't fall below $1 and delist. The scam will continue indefinitely.\n\nAll SP@Cs aren't scams but ALL SP@Cs  are overvalued with bad financials. That said most of them are down 90-95%. It's worth looking through the trash to find a diamond in the rough. For me right now it's microvast (MVST)",

There's quite a few but the vast majority are simply not there yet technologically and really you are giving your money away to them for free to burn. I strictly stayed away from immature industries and dying industries (e.g quantum computing, retail sales, etc.). One exponentially growing market where the market problems have viable solutions is the EV market. Looking at the market the vast majority of these companies are fairly overvalued (or one could argue the market is very forward looking due to the government legislative push). Once you filter out the science projects, pre-revenue companies, large caps, overvalued companies, cash burning auto manufacturers, etc you're really only left with Microvast. You can look at miners but you are getting closer to commodity trading. Specifically regarding microvast it's trading lower than book value and my own personal DCF models have it at $20-$40, analysts at $8, and that was before the recent increase in backlog. I can't run through all the details but while they did unfortunately lose the $200M grant, the TN factory and Huzhou expansion should result in $700M-$1B in revenue, better eps, and much closer to profitablity. That was after all one of the the primary goals of the merger. There's rumors that years ago they were to be bought out by Volkswagen but that was rejected for an IPO that never came to fruition. The company now as Wu stated is better than it's ever been.",

Compared to some mergers that clearly were scams this is a legitimate business so I do hope it works out. That said it looks like they are on the road to insolvency in less than a year. Had they'd stay private they'd be able to have another round. I'll add it to my watch list but really companies like this it's better wait and buy on the way up. 9/10 they end up getting reverse split, diluted, bankrupt, delisted, etc. Good luck!",

I guess the silver lining is that it wasn't necessarily execution it was delays in supply chains, but I'm sure they knew that was a risk and still went on the road with optimal projections. That said, in my field high voltage control panels had a 1 year delay essentially overnight. Right now they really only suffer from not having enough manufacturing capacity. At the current rate by end of year they'll have $500M-$1B in backlog. Which is good in terms of proven growth, but bad because they can't manufacture fast enough and convert that to booked revenue. The merger money was used to build a US factory so time will tell if it pans out. Depending on who you ask they are the only American battery manufacturer in America and definitely the only manufacturer in America that specializes in commercial vehicles.\n\nAlso why didn't you tell me about indi it looks like that boat in terms of the 50% discount, has sailed.",

            "comment": "The bois at Hindenburg called it. Stock is down &gt;99% since this report came out \n\nhttps://hindenburgresearch.com/mullen/\n\n---\n\nReport Published April 2022:\n\nDespite only spending ~$3 million in R&amp;D in 2021, Mullen claims its solid-state battery technology is on track for commercialization in 18 to 24 months, putting it head of every major technology and automaker in the industry who have collectively invested billions on solving the problem.\n\n\nIn 2020, Mullen announced a joint venture to manufacture its sold-state battery technology. We spoke with a senior executive familiar with the supposed joint venture who told us \u201cIt didn\u2019t exist at all\u201d. It was an apparent fabrication. He called Mullen CEO David Michery \u201cfast talking\u201d and a \u201chustler\u201d.\n\n\nMullen\u2019s battery claims were based on technology licensed from a 1-year-old Chinese battery technology company. After hyping the importance of the relationship, Mullen made one payment under the deal and promptly terminated the relationship. The Chinese company\u2019s website no longer works.\n\n\nRecently, Mullen shocked the market by claiming it would begin manufacturing 2 models of electric vans within months for an unnamed \u201cmajor, major Fortune 500 customer\u201d. The news sent its stock up ~35% intraday. The 2 electric cargo vans that Mullen claims it will be manufacturing are actually Chinese EVs rebranded with a Mullen logo. Import records show the company recently imported 2 vehicles from China, one of each model.\n\n\nMullen has other major production hurdles. The company has no EPA certificates for its vans (nor any vehicle), a requirement to sell vehicles in the U.S. that often takes 12-18 months. It has only a handful of job openings for its plant, and hasn\u2019t begun significant hiring, according to the President of the Tunica County Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nPreviously, Mullen had announced purchase orders valued at $60 million for 1,200 Class 2 commercial EV fleet vans. The order came from a small cannabis retailer with only one location and a new online store that says it prefers to ship via USPS.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Mullen DragonFly was revealed as a supercar built by Chinese manufacturer Qiantu Motors and was meant to be rebranded and sold by Mullen starting in 2020. Following the reveal, Mullen immediately defaulted on its payment obligations to Qiantu, leading to termination of the agreement in October 2019.\n\n\nMullen continued to market the vehicle as its own. In legal documents, Qiantu alleges this is \u201can inexcusable misuse of Qiantu\u2019s own intellectual property\u201d. Despite the termination of the agreement, Mullen to this day still says the DragonFly is \u201cComing Soon\u201d on its website and is soliciting $1,000 reservations for the vehicle.\n\n\nFor its other proposed vehicle, an electric SUV, Mullen previously announced it received an order for 10,000 vehicles, representing $500 million in potential revenue. We called the South Florida contractor firm that placed the order. It currently has only around 11 vehicles, none of which are electric.\n\n\nMullen\u2019s plant in Tunica Mississippi was previously tooled to build a pizza delivery car, but prior owners never managed to sell a single vehicle.\n\n\nMullen originally said the 124,700 sq/ft facility would serve as a pilot plant, but after abandoning several other plant projects, Mullen now claims it intends to expand the plant 10x, or an additional 1.2 million sq/ft, with no details on how this will even be physically possible.\n\n\nMullen claims its former pizza car manufacturing facility in Mississippi is stocked with state-of-the-art equipment and machinery, but photos and video of the facility show it has limited equipment.\n\n\nMullen\u2019s website features one photo of advanced manufacturing equipment. We found that it was a stock photo which appears to have been purchased from Adobe stock images.\n\n\nMullen\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO, David Michery led 5 failed penny stock companies prior to Mullen. Two had their securities registrations revoked by the SEC, two terminated their securities registrations, and the last one merged with a speculative gold mining company.\n\n\nMichery merged one of his prior entities as part of a 3-way deal with an individual who was later charged with criminal securities fraud and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors alleged that the merger deal involving Michery\u2019s prior company was part of the scheme.\n\n\nMichery lists no educational background in his Mullen biography. Contrary to other top electric vehicle executives that have engineering and manufacturing backgrounds, Michery\u2019s past work experience was largely in the entertainment industry.\n\n\nMullen\u2019s top holder is Terren Peizer, who controlled 29% of the company\u2019s voting power as of fiscal year-end. Peizer has backed numerous companies whose stocks have spiked to euphoric highs, only to plummet later.\n\n\nPeizer hired an individual just released from prison for fraud to one of his investment vehicles. The individual was later re-indicted on new fraud charges and sent back to prison.\n\n\nPeizer also has close business ties to Michael Wachs, Mullen\u2019s 3rd largest shareholder who controlled 8.1% of the company as of a recent prospectus. Wachs served time in jail for bank fraud after he pled guilty in 1997 to defrauding Chase Manhattan Bank for $20 million.\n\n\nWe have seen this story before, but Mullen strikes us as one of the worst. With echoes of Nikola, Lordstown, Kandi and Ideanomics, we think Mullen is just the latest in a long line of EV hustles.",

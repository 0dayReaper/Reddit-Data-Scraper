NVIDIA isn't up because it's producing AIs. It's up because it's manufacturing the hardware needed to run them.

Over the next ten years, this company will experience rapid growth. Because of their rapid revenue growth, they will reach the $600.00 price target sooner than most expect. As previously stated, they control 80% of the global market. So, from an investment standpoint, this is a buy, which is why roughly two dozen analysts have raised their price targets. As I previously stated, 600.00 will arrive quickly in the coming months.",

Unless you literally take out 99% of the reason it should go up in the short term, it won't pullback. Mind you I said pull back, because there are bulls just waiting on that to occur. Which means the payout for a pull back won't even be that great.\n\nSo shorting this is garbage, for quite a while.",

Has teamed up with NVidia, and has already partnered with Microsoft, Google, Adobe, Amazon, Salesforce, Boeing and more.\nUsed to be invested in them till management went to shit. But they have new management, new team, seems like they are starting to turn around, and could explode back up 10X with the clientel they have already and been on Ai since the 90's.\nI'm keeping a close eye on them. Might buy a little now till they get back above trend, and show change in earnings.\nHave a look and tell me what you think?",

    "postText": "I'm very new to trading and looking around at various ETFs and I came across this thing that is such a smooth upwards increase since 2016. But I don't understand what it is, does anyone know? Is it something that could crash like what even is this why is it so consistently upward\n\nSearch results just say return linked to money market rates and benchmarked with \u20acster compounded rate but idk what that means\n\nVarious sites say \"The recommended investment period for any investment in the Sub-Fund is 3 months.\" why is that since its so consistent? \n\nThanks",

And it's not really meant as an investment to increase money but just hold cash for u. However with high inflation rates the return on it is good now but when they lower the return on this gets to lower than a cash isa/similar.\n\nSo I think I'll put most of my money into this MMF tracker for like a year or two until this whole uncertainty period settles down a bit and inflation and interest rates return, then I'll put money into S&amp;P/ftse indexes. Idk what do you think\n\nI'm really hesitant to put much into s&amp;p as half the people think it's gonna shoot up with this AI stuff and half think we're about to have a terrible recession or something. Would hate to have the possibility of starting investing right at the peak before it drops a crapload",

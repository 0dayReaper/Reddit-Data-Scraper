    "postText": "The following Normalized, Monthly Chart tracks QQQ lagged 250 months, versus ARKK current.\n\n  \n\\--&gt; The white line is the Nasdaq 100, normalized for starting date (1/31/1996).  It shows the run-up to the early 2001 peak of the Dot Com bubble.\n\n  \n\\--&gt; The orange line is a CURRENT chart of the ARKK, normalized for its starting date (10/31/2016).  It shows the run up to the March 2021 peak of the SPAC/pre-IPO valuation bubble.  \n\\--&gt; Each vertical hash represents 5 years.  Each horizontal hash represents 5x the \"normalized\" starting value.  Therefore we see a 5-year run up for both that is similar in length and percentage (scope).\n\n  \n\\--&gt; From a timing perspective, ARKK has now reached the point at which QQQ bottomed, which represents a \\~ 3 year retracement from its peak.  \n\n\nThere are a mountain of fundamental similarities beyond the technical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ll6q31kmq84b1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3b7aed23162ca03069a124dfd71d6b3fdc64648",

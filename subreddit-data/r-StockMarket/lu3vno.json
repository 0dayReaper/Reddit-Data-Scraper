The clearinghouse then agreed to waive the entire $2.2 billion charge it had initially added, according to Tenev\u2019s account.\u00a0\n\nThe deposit requirements were only waived as a *result* of Robinhood's decision to suspend trading. The tone of your post suggests that you're saying Robinhood received a waiver yet went on to suspend trading of meme stocks anyway. It doesn't make the entire thing any less scummy, but you should take care not to spread misinformation regarding the sequence of events.",

I still think RH is decent for a beginner/student but not for the long term. The customer service was mainly what made me change last year.",

That tied with no options fees could save you tens of thousands depending on your trade volume and amounts.  If you buy and hold, that margin saving will quickly cover the minimal savings from a better trade routing. \n\nI\u2019m not pro RH or any single platform, they all have pros and cons. I currently use E*Trade, RH, TDAmeritrade, and Schwab for my active trading habits.\n\nE*Trade- it\u2019s okay, but access slows down ridiculously when market is hot- sometime inaccessible on app. Can\u2019t set default cost basis, default stuck as FIFO, need to message during settlement period to change.  No trade commissions, but fees per option contract.  Looser margin requirements from what I\u2019ve seen so far. \n\nRH- can\u2019t beat margin rates and no options fees, but very limited- can\u2019t get transaction downloads without customer service, Can\u2019t set default cost basis, default stuck as FIFO, need to message during settlement period to change. \n\nSchwab/TD Ameritrade- very similar. Schwab app sometimes goes \u201cdown\u201d when market is very active, but web interface seems stable.  No trade commissions but fees per option contract. Strict margin requirements (expect margin calls). They have best tax method for cost basis which is an amazing feature if you trade/sell options and hold shares for the same stock.",

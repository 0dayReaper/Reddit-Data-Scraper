If most of the stocks in a rising market are struggling, propped up by a few big winners, then you might be on shakier ground than a broader market rise. Are people just consolidating in the mega cap blue chips to feel safe? \n\nWish I knew the answers but I just am more cautious given the facts behind the S&amp;P rise.",

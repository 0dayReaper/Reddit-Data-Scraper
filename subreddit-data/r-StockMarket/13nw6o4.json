If they can\u2019t attribute revenue to those new customers directly they just lump all marketing expenses into opx. I have a feeling they don\u2019t want to split it out because it\u2019s probably embarrassingly low and they\u2019re likely losing money on ads and making up for it on returning customers. It used to be it takes more money to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. With the high cost of talent (leadership) and nurturing (Facebook, Google trade shows, outdoor and other tools) I feel like the cost are becoming more analogous.",

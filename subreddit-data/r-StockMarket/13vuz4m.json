But I\u2019ve always been thinking long and don\u2019t want to overreact. I don\u2019t intend to exit the market with losses. \n\nI\u2019m aware I made some bad choices with a few of these. Just wondering now what I can do or shouldn\u2019t do. \n\n***AFRM was my employer with a large equity award, why such a large % of my portfolio - I should\u2019ve sold it a long time ago but now I\u2019m holding out for it to at least get back into the 20-30 range eventually\u2026.though I know no guarantee",

Add a couple low-fee diversified ETFs if there are 1-2 fields you think might outperform if you need to scratch that itch. \n\nI was in a similar situation years ago, and I remember after I rebalanced into safer holdings the feeling that my finances were finally healthy and headed in the right direction waaaaaay outweighed the shitty feeling of taking a loss.\n\nEdit: typo",

I chose option 1, now I have some romo because days later and as of today after my stop loss it, it has fully recovered to around last earnings...\n\nrelated to baba. your dca is much better than my level, you are ok there. just watch it a bit.\n\nwith everything thing else like what others are saying. be honest with yourself based on the now versus the past. you do still think it will do well after looking over the company's info, yes or no? if no then then adjust, if yes, then decide if holding makes sense or take some or all of the loss as part of tax loss harvesting (3k max a year, but you can use rest of multiple years) and then decide putting the rest into an etf or mutual fund with a low cost fee that holds part of it with other securities.\n\nthe sell and move into an etf is what I found out some of the institutions do to avoid wash sales..like say apple... they sell apple, but then put the funds into spy, brk or some tech based one that has apple as part of it, wait 31 days, and but back later... so they avoid any wash sale aspect.\n\nbut I understand your paralysis, I have been working through parts of it myself, with romo and fomo.\n\nyou need to breathe, and then say and do what is right for you and your risk levels.\n\nwith me, I'm still very annoyed about selling and the surge, but what I decided to do was do some research and bought some back, and now I am in long call options.. not taking the same gains, and I'll have to report now on the close out of the options, but the volatility of the company, and risk level, imho is a bit lower and I don't have hold so much capital... I did massively deep in the money options for this case, so as it goes back up, and it goes to break even, I am not getting the equivalent gains as if I had bought at that strike.\n\n I have gone through 2 bankruptcy, chap 11 of firms, or reorganizations where my shares become worthless... the firm makes a new ticker or goes out of business. luckily, I had very small positions in each of these, but it sucks.. which is why I did the stop loss because I felt they were getting shorted and I had know idea how far that would go before the shorts were called... this is also why you need to understand what you invested in and not. Warren Buffet has said if the price is low and it is a good firm, you just are down on paper, it will recover, you can look to get more or wait for it to go back up. if you panic sell, it probably wasn't the right company for you to own as you couldn't handle the downside.\n\nfinal feedback... because of my bloody debacle I did some charting... 20% draw down is normal in regular stocks, but others can have larger ones of 40-85%, which can be painful especially on growth stocks that are not being valued properly. your decision is to hold because it will go back up or rebalance accordingly.",

You are given money immediately by doing so called a premium and if by the expiration date the price point isn't met you keep the shares and the premium paid to you. \n\nThere are some downsides to this if the price goes higher than the strike price you can lose out on profit. If you cancel the contract early you may owe some of the premium back. Also some potential tax implications. \n\nBut do your research. You can learn options don't just leave it sitting there.",

Just keep in mind selling covered calls will tie up your capital so if you sell a cc with like 3 months to expiry you are basically locked in for those 3 months and can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) sell your shares.

Diversify into other sectors beyond the mega caps, maybe look for mature, defensive companies that pay a dividend. Also, technical analysis is mostly on the same level as reading entrails  EXCEPT that it does reflect human group behaviour, i.e. if a stock has dropped and 50% of the owners are bagholding, then a sudden rise will make a chunk of them sell to break even - that's price resistance. A sudden drop will make some give up, a small drop will make some double down. These ideas of 'market resistance' and 'bases' will give you an idea about how short term moves work. \n\nNext, look at yourself and know your weaknesses. For example, I tend to not let my winners run as the valuations get wild. I'm happiest as a value investor and stick with that so I don't get too emotional. Mostly.\n\nThe best strategy I've ever used is to scroll out to the 10 year chart and squint at it. Does it go up to the left? Is the current price in the middle or below the average trend line? Does it have a moat to its business? Is the P/E reasonable to comparable players? Are there any major flaws - new competition, high debt, idiot management etc.? Make a list of 20-30 stocks you want to own and put a target buying price next to them. Then wait. I started this process a couple of years ago, am still waiting on some sectors, but having a written plan has been invaluable.",

If the answer is as shallow as, to sell it for more later, then you will always be guessing and hoping your guesses pan out. These stocks could tank, they could go to the moon. \n\nFor each stock I buy I have a buying statement that I save. I am buying X company because... That statement is my foundation for when and if I sell. I bought Intel at $32 on its way down, because I believe in the capex plan to increase domestic chip manufacturing and pivoting from competing with Nvidia and AMD to competing with Taiwan semiconductor. So, my foundation is no matter what the price does I'm in it until their pivot plan has a chance to succeed. I'll hold until a few years after all their new plants are built and reassess them then. \n\nThinking that way is so much less stressful than panicking over the action of the price from day to day, and wondering if I'm smart or dumb for buying/holding/selling.",

            "comment": "I estimate on the info given that you own about 4 shares of SBUX bought at about $87.50 which is when it was crossing the 200day MA.\n\nSo I'd say if all your purchases are about like that, buying after a correction when first crossing 200 Day; then you're doing OK. Can't complain. With that method. It works well with 2x leverage by the way. It's a recommended method with 2x leverage. \n\nSell after a bull run when crossing 200 day down.\nBuy after bear correction when crossing 200day up.\n\n2x leverage. Pretty solid method.\n\nIf you bought at 87.50",

I don\u2019t think I can leverage in a Roth IRA and honestly I would prefer to leave that to my regular brokerage. But it was a good analysis based off the information given. I wish I had bought at $77 per share though.",

People who take the $77 bet are confident there will be a turn around, which if there isn't, you could be on the hook for much bigger losses.\n\nPeople who take the $86 bet are on the hook for a loss down to $77, which usually is where something retests and strengthens or weakens, giving you decision making info and time.\n\nIf you took the $77 bet ideally you would want a tighter stop-loss and just get out if your trade is invalidated. Or you're trying to build a position in a falling knife and have good cash on reserve to buy even further down, etc.\n\nSomething like SBUX you can get away with that because it's pretty good. But something pretty unheard of like some uranium mine, you'd use the other method.",

Which is unreasonable. \n\nThe weekly chart suggests you could have gotten a lower price and the price hit the 200week MA.\n\nIt hit the bottom of the daily LIN Reg.\n\nIt hit the bottom of the weekly Lin Reg.\n\nSo I can't say if you have a method. But your method of using MAs as entries is unrefined. \n\nThe slow stochastic on the weekly failed to hold the 50 midpoint which was another sign of weakness.\n\nThe slow stoch looked weak on the daily also.\n\nA mixed bag. The 200 day is a generally good entry with a tight stop\n\nBut OKE just gapped down hard, locking you in. Everyone probably took that entry long and caused the long squeeze melt down.\n\nThe slow stock showed no buyers. \n\nThe Lin reg told banks they could get a better price.\n\nOke probably trading on the weekly not the daily.\n\nAs such you probably mis-timed your entry by not having more advanced tools.\n\nI'm impressed by your SBUX entry. \n\nYour OKE entry could have used some work. But OKE was more complex.\n\nI used to cut down trees while they were on fire. Being a master sawyer meant knowing when to do NOTHING.\n\nOKE is an example of that...imagine if you put your life savings in that entry \n\nVersus into SBUX.\n\n2 very different results.\n\nBeing a master is knowing why SBUX was less Risk of downside than OKE.\n\nI think the Lin reg would have helped you see it best.",

I've seen two very different trades in SBUX and OKE.\n\nI'd say your method is probably moving averages, which can only get you so far.\n\nOKE entry seems to line up with recent gap down after a seemingly quiet period post earnings. \n\nYou probably looked at 200day MA And saw quiet after decent earnings. \n\nSo did everyone else. Long squeeze = gap down. Locked in losses.\n\nLin reg and slow stochastic would have told you that something else was going on with OKE and to wait.\n\nYou're doing better than most I'd say, with educated picks. But if I'm right about OKE then you're sophisticated enough to be dangerous and have much to learn about Linear regression and slow stochastic. \n\nThose will help clean up your moving average picks.",

The only reason you\u2019d buy NVDA is because you think it\u2019s a strong company. \n\nStrong companies tend not to see their share prices fall by 20% unless it\u2019s something that broadly effects the economy. \n\nSo just say you\u2019re waiting for a recession. But if NVDA just randomly starts falling 20%, it is probably in a situation where it\u2019s business prospects have dimmed and you\u2019ll want to reconsider buying. In other words, it won\u2019t be the same NVDA but 20% cheaper. It will be a diminished NVDA at a market price.",

They would have to have no cost of goods, no SG&amp;A, and no investments back into the business. Intel is a perfect example of this playing out over time.

A CPU can do it faster because it's simply not doing that much. For AI art and movie creation, that's a different story. It lends itself very well to processing on GPUs, but how big a market share is that really? Any individual idiot can already download Automatic1111 and make AI art all day on his video card at home. Really no need to ugprade. Movie studios will want to use a bunch for this, but that's what, maybe 10,000 cards for every movie studio that needs AI art on the planet. Most of them will farm it out to the cloud where GPU's will be shared by multiple projects.

I haven't worked with LLM's or generative art, but I understand how they work. I could probably create either with just what I know now, but I imagine there's a lot of little tricks and intricate details I don't know because it's not my niche. \n\nHere's a way to think of it. CPU and GPUs are very similar. They both have a small instruction set that is heavily used to make complicated tasks. Things like Add/Multiply/Move data/call interrupt/etc... Where they differ is how they scale. Think of modern video cards as supercomputers inside your computer. A CPU typically has 4-32 cores. Each one can do 1-2 instructions per cycle and will do an unfathomable number of cycles per second. (off the top of my head, I don't know what the MIPs are for a modern CPU, but you can look that up if you so care). GPU's are much less powerful cores, but a video card will have literally thousands of them. Overall, this is a more efficient design from a power/how much stuff you get done point of view. \n\nIt's like having 1,000 dumbass infantry vs having 10 badass special forces soldiers. Each special forces guy is exponentially more trained, competent, intelligent, and skilled than each infantry, but having 1,000 of them is still better in many situations. \n\nTo use the processing power of a GPU, your code needs to first copy all the execution code and relevant data onto the GPU. The code is then executed on all the cores at the same time on different parts of the data and the result is copied off of it. This is super efficient for operations that involve lots of processing on a small piece of data. For example, things like video encoding/processing, hashing (for crypto mining), etc.. \n\nLLM create hashes and predictive patterns on huge datasets. This is a trivial operation, but it just takes large amounts of source data.",

A CPU can do it faster because it's simply not doing that much\n\nexcept that the CPUs do not do it faster, the external systems are at least 10 but often 100+ times faster.  The training systems often use 16 bit floating point (float16 or bfloat16) in training and even cruder quantization in deployment or other tasks---lowering the data transfer and computational requirements very substantially.\n\nI don't know any common CPU that does [b]float16 natively yet.  For the mul-add you might a 32 bit accumulator at times (because of dynamic range) but 16 bit activation &amp; 16 bit coefficients. \n\nEven with their relatively small vector cores (AVX) it would be advantageous (at least doubling speed) and likely inexpensive in additional hardware, but they don't.  \n\n5 years ago it was obvious this should be done: it's shocking how far back Intel and AMD are.   Intel bought at least 2 startups for AI accelerators (Nervana and and Israeli one).  Where are the products?",

Before that, it had to be approximated with multiple steps and was slow. I learned to program back then, and I was taught to use fixed point math whenever possible and just move over the decimal point for speed. Then the Pentium came out, and it was moot. Every processor since then can do floating point math natively. This was in the 90s. \n\nYes, parallel processing on a GPU of images is really where it shines, but it has nothing to do with native float capacity. It's just processing horsepower. Each core is given a small piece of an image to work on, and they can easily do them without having to talk to each other very much.",

Regarding valuations, it might be worth considering that IoT is just getting started. Most homes, cars, appliances, and whatever else you can think of, are not online. Approximately 35% of the planet is still not fully online in the way that we think of being online in the developed world. What will enable a fully connected world? For the foreseeable future it is silicon chips. They will enable functionality and intelligence in everything. Betting on chip designers and manufacturers over the long term will be a safe investment. Short term fluctuations are inevitable as are the long term gains in this sector. Something else worth mentioning is the quality of NVDA as a company. They hire the absolute best and have a culture that supports them. Try plucking an NVDA employee to go and work for another company, they will tell you thanks but no thanks. This company is like no other.",

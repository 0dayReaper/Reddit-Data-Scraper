    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to evaluate Zack\u2019s Research Wizard program for which they want a couple thousand dollars. \n\nZacks promises high returns but they seem unrealistically high. This program has some important features, specifically Backtesting. This allows someone to construct a filter and then test that filter on a possibly historical database that Zack\u2019s provides to see how that filter supposedly performed over the past year.\n\nAll of Zack\u2019s systems seem to be based on the same methodology. Their sales are strongly oriented towards getting one to make an instantaneous decision to buy their program. Their program interfaces are outdated, fixed-size screens that don\u2019t comply well with HD monitors.\n\nSo has anyone here had experience good or bad with their Research Wizard program? Thanks very much for any help.",

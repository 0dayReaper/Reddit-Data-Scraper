    "postText": "Hey everyone! Happy hump day! As all of you know, there are so many different holding companies out there that all pretty much do the same thing in one way or another. I still like taking a look ou there though to see if any are uniquely positioned in the market. By unique I mean a company that is one of the bigger holdings companies in their market or a company that has unique investments made (good investments). \n\nAnd honestly I think I might have found a company that checks both boxes in AGBA Group Holding Limited. AGBA is a  wealth and health platform that is based out of Hong Kong. Not only are they based out of Hong Kong they\u2019re the biggest in Hong Kong\u2026 They have over 2000 financial advisors, 1000 financial products, 2600+ workforce, more than 100 business partners and over 400,000 customers. They\u2019re also looking to expand into other parts of Asia after just recently purchasing a financial advisory company in Singapore.\n\nI put together a list of things that I like about the **potential investment** and things that are kind of **putting me off** of them. So here it is:\n\n**Things I like:**\n\n1. They\u2019re the biggest in their respective market with a large amount of financial products and business partners\n2. They\u2019re looking to expand their business to others parts of Asia\n3. The company is very optimistic about Hong Kong\u2019s economic rebound will drive business to another level (reopening of borders, the return of mainland visitors, and strong domestic demand)\n\n**Things I\u2019m not sure of/putting me off:**\n\n1. They have a relatively small market cap (98.047M)\n2. Seemed to have decreased in profit last year compared to 2021(Net loss: US$44.5m (down by 146% from US$96.5m profit in FY 2021)\n3. I\u2019m not 100% sure on the business landscape of Asia let alone Hong Kong\n\nThese were just some of main concerns and main things that I like about the company. Does anyone have any other concerns, questions, pros, or comments on em? Would love to hear what ppl think before I drop some money into them. Really appreciate everyone taking the time to read through my mid day rant/findings.",

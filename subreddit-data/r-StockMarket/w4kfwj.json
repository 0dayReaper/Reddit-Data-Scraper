    "postText": "\u201cBig Short\u201d fame investor Michael Burry said U.S. House Of Representatives Speaker **Nancy Pelosi** \u201cmade a bundle\u201d on semiconductor stocks she recently purchased because she knew a key bill would make it through the Senate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5eockv91yc91.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92ae0fe06d94be578b89aeb36b75d9d5760aace8\n\nWhat Happened: Burry made his comments on Twitter on Wednesday. He said tagging the Democrat politician, \u201cSo Speaker Pelosi made a bundle on semiconductor stocks bought recently. Should be illegal.\u201d\n\nBurry also shared a news report on the Senate passing a bipartisan bill, which would subsidize domestic semiconductor production with a $52 billion support. \n\nSource: [https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/07/28145000/big-short-fame-investor-michael-burry-says-nancy-pelosis-semiconductor-stock-buy-shouldnt-be-legal](https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/07/28145000/big-short-fame-investor-michael-burry-says-nancy-pelosis-semiconductor-stock-buy-shouldnt-be-legal)\n\nThe Big Short\u2019s Michael Burry says members of congress should be banned from trading single stocks. He quoted the recent purchase of 20,000 NVIDIA (NVDA) shares by Paul Pelosi before Nancy Pelosi supported the CHIPS Plus bill, a $52 billion semiconductor bill.  \n\nDo you agree?",

            "comment": "So easy to mitigate something like this:\n\n* You and your spouse cannot purchase individual stocks or options while you are serving in Congress. Only index funds.\n* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.\n* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.\n\nThese three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent. If you're a politician who is 'serving the public', investing in stocks shouldn't be a priority for you as it has been for Nancy.",

Bernie is the best person in congress that we have. By far. Whether you agree with him or not, the man is open, honest, principled, and never stops fighting for what he believes is right.

Eliminate campaign financing altogether, have funds that get unlocked once you reach the required number of signatures, and limit campaigning to 6-8 weeks with debates and town halls that feature firm moderators and fact checking. Pay politicians well enough to headhunt the best and brightest from the public sector, put them under constant financial audit while and after in office, and we might actually make the real headway we need to take on this century's problems, rather than re-losing battles (like outright war, infectious disease, and human rights) we thought were won in the last one.",

What isn't available to the masses is whether or not we are approaching a market bottom or are looking at a further 10 to 20% drop. Pelosi has the ability to take the loss as well as wait it out.  As far as paying them more, no.  When they retire, they get to keep their unspent war chest, as well as cushy book deals, speaker circuit, and highly paid positions in private sector because of their connections, not their knowledge. Constitutionally, they were supposed to represent their constituents, not be the .0001%.",

    "postText": " My thesis is that the market is imbalanced to tech. Tech is pushing to tag all time highs and might but that's a good entry for shorts, so I expect SPY to level off or even come down, and expect tech to fall so took short on AAPL. The rest of the longs are because I think these are better values at their current levels. Oil I believe will trade in a range, the size of the range will be better known after JUNE 04 OPEC meeting.\n\nShort:\n\n* SPY (new)\n* AAPL (new)\n* RTX (hedging)\n\nLongs:\n\n* GLD\n* SLV\n* XLE (added more)\n* UCO\n* TLT\n* NOC (added more)\n* ABBV (new)\n* CCJ\n* RIOT\n* LEN (Added more)\n* PM (Waiting to close)\n* TMC",

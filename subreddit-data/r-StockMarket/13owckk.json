Also downvoted.\n\nI noticed the metaverse isn't a thing anymore....\n\nI noticed the fines + settlement for US citizens....\n\nIt's like... I was right..... lol\n\nOr if you want keep investing in a company that owns Facebook. Facebook is used less and less each day. Younger people just don't prefer Facebook. They use TikTok and Instragram.\n\nInstragram is positive for Meta. Facebook is for dinosaurs.",

Short term, I'd agree it may go up as it seems many people are invested in Meta.\n\nLong term I feel much differently.\n\nAlso Meta had to sell Giphy. They bought it for 400 million, sold it for 53 million. They lost 347 million on Giphy.\n\nThere's the US settlement that Meta had to give up 725 million.\n\nMeta had to just pay a 1.3 billion fine over in Europe.\n\nI would imagine that it's profitable still for Meta to sell users data without consent, and pay fines. But this makes me uncomfortable to continue to use a company. It doesn't make me feel safe.\n\nI would feel better if I didn't have to worry that Meta was always going to sell my data without my consent. If I could actually rely on that, my opinion on long term could change some.",

One of my friends who is super into $TSLA sent me the LinkedIn post and I knew I had to share it to Reddit so that everyone could be just as amazed as me.\n\nFrom my understanding on how it works, Tesla hooked up with Movella to use their Xsens Mocap Suit to digitize the movement for Tesla's brand new bots (which can be seen in the video). This works because AI is a set of algorithms that use data pattern recognition and the sensors on the Movella suits provide generated and aggregated data. Data that the AI of the bot can then use to move accordingly.\n\nI'm not an expert but this is what I gathered from the post and video. If anyone has something to add on please don't hesitate to!",

    "postText": "The best kept secret, I think, of the linear regression is that the yellow box (the end of the lin reg) which I call the gate, must pass through the two price extremes marked by the green arrows.\n\nThus you can predict the future Linear Regression as I have done. It doesn't predict price, rather it predicts possible price extremes on that time frame in a forward time frame.\n\nPrice extremes \\*\\*\\*MUST PASS THROUGH\\*\\*\\* the Linear Regression gate. It is a phenomenon of the Linear Regression that is pretty obvious when you understand how it is calculated.\n\nAs such in the below example, we can see that the gate will swing down to acomodate the price extremes of COVID for $XLE and thus $XLE over the next 2 years will have as much as a 30% upside price extreme from its current price.\n\nThe question for any trader/investor is what extreme they think the price will test and to place their position accordingly.\n\nI therefore think $XLE's extremes will be $70 to $105 over the next 2 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ofmBxjIj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ofmBxjIj/)",

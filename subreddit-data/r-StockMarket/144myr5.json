Not exactly a red hot take, especially in this political moment, and it seems fairly well aligned with the politics of many on this sub. In any case, she has no control over fiscal policy, Congress does, and they don't seem too terribly deferential too what the Treasury Secretary says, so I expect her words will largely go unheeded by the people who actually have the power to set fiscal policy. What am I missing here?",

Just because wealthy people pay more doesn't mean poor people don't pay at all. That's what folks aren't understanding. In fact, as a percentage of their income, poor people generally pay more in taxes.\n\n Let's not forget that we're discussing taxes on **earned income**. Those wealthy people you referenced, top 10-25%, generate a significant portion of their wealth from capital investments and other vehicles where the tax rate is 0% or virtually 0%. They aren't depending on a paycheck and living hand to mouth like low income earners. Those top earners are sheltering bulk portions of their wealth from taxation. Low income earners don't have that benefit, and 100% of their \"wealth\" is taxable.\n\nThose coins being issued in the form of refunds to low income earners have never been a problem when compared to the vast wealth being sheltered outside of our tax system. It doesn't help that certain Americans are so fixated in scapegoating loose change that they can't recognize the hundreds of billions of dollars being lost under their own feet.\n\nBut back to my point: Everyone working a payroll job pays taxes. Paying taxes and getting a refund are two separate issues. Low income earners do not determine their eligibility for tax credits or rebates...Congress does. Those credits and rebates do, have, and will change on political whims or less. The one thing that remains consistent in this equation is the fact that if you work for income, you pay taxes on that income. All workers pay taxes.",

Consider this thought experiment.\n\nSuppose there exists an ideal modal target income for a household of a given composition and location. Suppose this ideal is based on optimizing the functions for crime rates, GDP, health and wellness indexes, etc. Take your pick.\n\nOr if that's too simplistic, we can suppose there exists an optimal *mixture* of incomes in a given region with the optimization function giving us a distribution of incomes rather than a single point, there's still a median of course, but whatever.\n\nIt's not necessary for us to decide what this ideal is, we don't even need to think it's possible to figure out that optimum, we just have to agree that it theoretically exists.\n\nIn a practical sense therefore, tax policy that pushes people toward that optimum is \"good\" and policy that doesn't is \"bad\".\n\nSo \"good\" tax policy would be one for which everyone who earns less than that optimum has net negative taxation while everyone who earns more has net positive taxation, with the absolute value of the net increasing the further you are from the optimum.\n\nThis is \"fair\" in the sense that it has the best result for society which is the ostensible point of tax policy. Even if we don't know the optimum, we can make reasonable guesses about where it might be and make tax policy accordingly. Like, it's pretty obvious that a taxpayer having a total income of $15k is below that no matter where they are in the country.",

We cut funding to Ukraine, Russia takes them as a nation, now this gives Russia confidence to decrease the Soviet Union. China now has a reason to work alongside Russia since they can handle their own and almost starts getting too confident that they attack Taiwan knowing western superpowers will do anything to avoid confrontation. US has no choice but to fight back and now we have WW3. Whether you like it or not, making Russia look like a fool out of itself is preventing a confident alliance that leads to a lot more problems. You think our problems would be bad? You should think what a severe war like that would do",

The situation you are painting are straight talking points from CNN or MSNBC. If you think our government cares about the Taiwanese people and not just the cheap labor for our semiconductors, then you are woefully misinformed. We are being pushed into WW3 by stoking this fire in Ukraine. The fact that there was a peace deal on the table within the first week of this war kicking off, but our government, along with Boris Johnson using Zelensky as a puppet for their agendas just goes to show this is not about preventing WW3 but starting it. \n\nMost of China's energy is imported, which is extremely expensive. We are China's #1 customer. They don't want to be a part of this war because it will cost them too much. They do want Taiwan, and they will invade. It's just a matter of time.",

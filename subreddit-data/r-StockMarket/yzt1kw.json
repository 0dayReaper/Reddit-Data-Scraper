With a traditional fiat currency you have a bank. The banks only job is to provide security of your money. The concept dates way back, in a time where people stored gold and such and the paper bill was an actual reciepe for your gold in the bank vault. But since the removal of the gold standard (~1970) it really is a worthless piece of paper. We have the bank which has the right to decide how many coins/papers can be printed, and to have that kind of power, creates a risk for corruption.\n\nBitcoin dont have a CEO, there is no one in charge. The creation of new coins is fixed on a timeline that halves every 4th year (deflationary). There is no one in control of the creation of money and the risk for corruption is gone. Its trustless, there is no 3rd party involved, you can open a new account for your children at 22pm saturday night and dont need to contact anyone for it, your child could sell lemonade on the street and accept secure payments to his own wallet, hassle free and no charge just put up your QR-code for customers to use.\n\nBitcoin solved the double spend problem.\n\nWhen we go to a deflationary system instead of a Inflationary system that will probably make people better at savings, since the value of money increase with time and if people save money they wont be spending on shit, we could decrease this consumer shit we have going on.\n\nCountries do print tons of new cash to fund war, that wont be possible.. War will not be as profitable.\n\nBitcoin is a network, not just any network.. Its the most secure network humans know. As for an attack it is more likely your bank will be attacked.\n\nA bank is centralized it have a single point of attack and can steal money from every customer.\nIn bitcoin an attack will be against one wallet. Bitcoin is decentralized. \n\nSure if someone points a gun to your head you can be robbed, but the same is true without bitcoin also.\n\nBut yea... A form of payment dont do anything.",

Commodities are purely supply and demand. There has been points where gold and silver have outperformed the overall market.\n\nThere's no possible drift with commodity assets, like there is with stocks. You shouldn't expect silver or gold to go up in 5 years, if in 5 years there is no demand for gold or silver.",

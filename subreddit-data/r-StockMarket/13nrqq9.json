Many loans with low interest rates will soon expire and new loans will only come with high interest rates. Together with higher labor costs and stagnating sales, companies will continue to invest, but not as much as before 2022. A deeper recession will be prevented by the fact that, in contrast to previous downturns, the labor factor will be limited by stagnating population growth, which in turn will lead to permanently low unemployment. Also because in the medium term, AI is not yet ready to replace labor in many areas on a sustainable basis. \nHowever, as soon as inflation declines and interest rates stop rising, I expect a rapidly rising stock market.\nThis will be driven primarily by the fact that almost all companies have raised their prices by 40-50% in the inflation years (over a 2-3 year period). This, in turn, will cause the prices of these companies to increase by at least 50%-100% over the next 5 years.",

The 2008 bailout followed by quantitative easing / fed is what heavily changed with insane amounts of cash ( 9 trillion). After saying that I really believe where this is going to look like a nice fit is not in the stock market, but instead for the US dollar.  The principles are still correct, however it's in the wrong market. \n\nWhat other markets could we see this type of chart ? I would have to say the dollar, auto loan market, and commercial real estate market.",

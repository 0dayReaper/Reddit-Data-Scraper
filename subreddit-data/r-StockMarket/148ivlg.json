    "postText": "Suppose one urgently needs money for a new investment and decides to go public. My company is worth 10 Euros and 10 shares are issued, so I get 10 Euros and can buy a new cup while others can now buy 1/10 of my company at 1 Euro each. I now have 2 questions about this.\n\n1. Why can I now be paid 10 euros directly? After all, the whole thing would be for only be a safe number for the bank if really 10 shares were bought by someone else to get this money back in, at the present time, only 10 shares were made available. What if no one is really interested in these shares and no purchase is ever made? Then I have created 10 Euros out of nothing, so to speak.\n2. As soon as the IPO is finished and I have received my money, I have nothing more to do with the traded shares. I know that the share price never exactly reflects the value of the company (there are also undervalued/overvalued share prices). But why does the average stock increase with the company value when everything is going great and my company is suddenly worth 100 Euros? The stock exchange does not suddenly intervene and set the value of my share prices to 10 euros per share, but more people want to buy my shares than sell them - but why? My company's growth is - from a purely technical point of view - since the IPO completely decoupled from the price development of the shares, which value of the share is then really the deciding factor if I do not pay out dividends why people want to buy more when my company grows? Is it the say, or the rights I initially gave up in my own company when I went public?\n\nQuite fictitiously, a company could record an overnight increase of 250% but the people on the stock market would not care at all, then absolutely nothing would change in the share price, so you have to hope for something besides the increase in the share price, otherwise that would be a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\".\n\nHere is a very similar question (maybe it's more understandable): [https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/435ub6/eli5why\\_does\\_demand\\_for\\_stock\\_rise\\_when\\_a\\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/435ub6/eli5why_does_demand_for_stock_rise_when_a_company/)",

            "comment": "1. Your company only pockets that money if the shares are purchased. Presumably, no company gets listed on a public exchange if there's no demand for ownership, and if nobody wants to buy shares of a private company, then the current owner just remains the sole shareholder.\n2. Stocks are literal ownership of a company, not merely symbols. They entitle the holder to a vote in the shareholder meetings, and if you amass more than 50% of a company's total shares, you are in fact and effect the owner, as you control the outcome of all such ballots. Because a share is literal ownership, its *minimum* value is theoretically the liquidating value of the company. Add up how much the company's assets would sell for, plus its cash on hand, subtract debt/liabilities, and divide by the number of shares. This is called Book Value. The hypothetically ideal share value is based on Discounted Cash Flow, which is how much you'd pay today for a likely payout in the future. Thus, if your company was profiting $10 a year, and  then profits $20, the share price increases not only because you have a little bit more cash on hand now, but because there's an expectation that the company will continue to earn more.\n\nObviously real life share prices are influenced by tons and tons of external factors that a company is not control of but that still affect its ability to maintain cash flow. Interest rates on debt or technological advances, to name some obvious ones. The number of shares also affects price just because of the math. If a company has 10 shares, and decides it needs to raise funds by issuing 10 more, each share is now worth half as much (assuming no change in earnings).\n\nIn real life, if a company noted a massive increase in profits and the market didn't respond, it would indicate some factor other factor is influencing the price. If you look at a company's balance sheet, you can see there are a whole lot of different things that get tallied up to find the total earnings, profit, assets, and liabilities. \n\nAnd then there's the fact that there will always be a difference between a company's book value and whether people want to own it. A company might have a billion dollars in book value, but because the market is competitive, if it cannot generate an *increase* in value for shareholders, its share are effectively worth nothing. There are plenty of companies that trade under book value, but because they are unprofitable, the only way publicly available shares would can increase in value is if the company liquidates and cashes out the shareholders. Extremely unlikely.",

That new cup you bought somehow doubled your companies value. I could probably sell my stock at 2 euros to someone hoping the following year the trend continues.",

            "comment": "Never forget that the purpose of stock is to give the shareholder the rights to a fractional share of the company 's future income stream.\n\nThe stock price paid is based on the buyer's best guess at the value of that future income stream. If profits increase dramatically, shareholders expect a share of the increase, or they permit mgmt to spend those profits on things that they hope create even higher future profit margins.\n\nSometimes a stock's market value  is dislocated and those times are what the best investors try to take advantage of.",

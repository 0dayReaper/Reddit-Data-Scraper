    "postText": "I tried to open some credit put positions on TLT and couldn't get a bid filled below $100 so didn't fill them as I have a big enough position already.\n\nThis is a sign no one is willing to sell below a $100, no one is concerned the price will go below $100, etc.\n\nThe credit for those puts was dismal.\n\nI'm calling a bottom in TLT for the near term..next few months or so.\n\nMy interpretation is the market will do a flippening. Tech will drain out and money will flow back into some defensive/cyclical/income sectors and bring the indexes to some average. I shorted SPY as well as AAPL.\n\nThe only reason to do both is that AAPL was offering better money for the short. So it's like a kicker to a bet, more capital efficient than going all in one (higher risk) or the other (lower risk). Helps balance out and stagger the price and time of the trades.",

    "postText": "I have a loss of around $40k from selling stocks earlier this year. Have cash proceeds plus other cash which in total is about $500k. Want to use that cash to recoup those losses to hopefully break even. Was planning to maybe make a big purchase later so need money within 12 months. I dread the thought of having 10+ years when I'll be carrying the loss on my tax return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy initial thoughts include the following:\n\n1. Dump all cash into dividend stock (something like VZ or SPG for 7.55% or 6.95% respectively).\n\n* Pros - relatively straightforward\n* Cons - potential stock price fluctuation, which can negate the whole benefit, money will need to be held for about a year, dividends don't cancel losses from stocks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. 1-year CD (something like CIT that offers 5%)\n\n* Pros - safe\n* Cons - money is already in 4.2% HYSA, so this is not really \"recouping\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. All in VTI/VTSAX/etc\n\n* Pros - no comments\n* Cons - too long to wait\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Gamble/day trade\n\n* Pros - potential\n* Cons - bigger losses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies if my question is dumb, I'm a newbie. What would you suggest?",

But they are risky in the short term.  Beyond that, all you can do is research, choose good stocks, pick good entrances.  You can wait on your losses and see if the market recoups or move out of your losses immediately into something stable or pick an entry to a stock you think is a better place for your money to grow",

    "postText": "The cost of satellite imagery has come down considerably in the last few years, I believe largely because of Starlink. With everyday people gaining access to the tech, I imagine we're going to see some lucrative use cases emerge. \n\nI recently started using satellite images to some extent for real estate research myself. Have been asking around in other communities and apparently its also popular for commodities traders and hedge funds. Curious to hear if anyone is trading, or knows people trading based off of satellite images?\n\nI've been using [skyfi.com](https://skyfi.com) to acquire satellite imagery, which is easy to use, and not too expensive. Google Earth can be valuable but the data isn't current, which is a huge limitation.",

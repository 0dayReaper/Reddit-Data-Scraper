Some  producers having a lower uranium production then their uranium supply  commitments towards their clients, so those producers have to buy   uranium in the spotmarket too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B)** Before the weekend there was information about 1 RFP for uranium delivery in short term for 1 nuclear power plant that is significantly impacting the uranium price at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2c21ufxx784b1.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7edbe1cb3a9d2fb27077dafd13a4c2d793cf327a\n\nBut there are other western reactors in a similar situation... \n\nAnd today we got confirmation from TradeTech: The uranium mid term (1y to 3y) price just jumped higher by more than 9%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nni8vtnc784b1.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6bf6afa8d179a706819b0d3273a7ae6024ef6328\n\n**C)** Also more and more financial funds are created to buy physical uranium in the spotmarket, because investors start to notice that there is a global growing supply deficit at today's uranium prices.\n\n**Zuri-Invest** will start buying uranium in the spotmarket, probably starting this week. Zuri-Invest on their own will have at least 100M USD which represents approximately one month of uranium spot  supply.\n\nBut Zuri-Invest is not the only one buying uranium in the tiny spotmarket, by consequence those 100M USD together with the uranium spotbuying from others will largely exceed on month of spotsupply, creating a significant upward pressure on the uranium spotprice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: John Quakes on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/jm5ehbd2584b1.png?width=395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7a0587a257ea3a7e2f1f1e296b2b578e51e718d)\n\n \n\n**D)** Why did the uranium price remain stable?\n\nThe uranium companies made a first bull run in 2021-2022, but got depressed by the negativity in the stockmarket in general (Market went from \"risk on\" to \"risk off\" mode), while the uranium spotprice actually remained quite stable.\n\nThe uranium price remained quite stable, because the sector fundamentals are very bullish, even producers buy uranium in the tiny uranium spotmarket at these low uranium prices.\n\nBased on the global production cost curve analysis vs the global annual uranium demand, we know that high production cost producers/projects (need a sell price of 80 - 90 USD/lb to make an acceptable profit) are needed to get the global uranium supply and demand back in equilibrium.\n\nAn uranium price of 60 USD/lb isn't high enough to get the needed higher production cost producers to produce uranium again!\n\nThe consequence: **Upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket is steadily building up**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we are steadily going to go back to \"risk on\" mode imo. Tomorrow, in a month, 3 months? We'll see. It's not IF, but WHEN.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf interested:\n\n\\- uranium sector etf's: URNM etf, URA etf, URNJ etf\n\n\\- physical uranium funds: U.UN and U.U on TSX, SRUUF on US stock exchange, YCA on london stock exchange\n\n\\- individual uranium companies (look at the holdings of the etf's)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own DD before investing.**\n\nCheers",

            "comment": "TOP in my opinion is the ultimate insider trading stock.\n\nZhong Yang Financial Group Ltd was the original name to appear when buying or selling this stock. Name was changed after IPO came out, to TOP Financial Group.\n\nDo you know how hard it is to Google \"TOP Financial Group\"? It's worded to be so vague. Articles of \"top stocks to buy\" comes up instead of the actual stock. It's actually difficult to Google search information on this stock based on the wording.\n\nWhen stock was going up a lot, multiple media sources all claimed people on Reddit were talking about this stock online and working together to get the price up. I searched Reddit.... there was nothing. Not one mention of this stock.\n\nReddit only began talking about this stock AFTER the stock had already gone up. Many people confused as the media claimed it was people from Reddit that made this stock go up. So your own research. The media made false claims. That's very fishy to me.\n\nOnly 11 employees in this company? Does that sound normal to you? Only 11 people working?\n\nWhat about even before the price went up, the stock could be at like $5 (this is an estimate as I don't have the actual numbers in front of me) for a period of hours, then instead of trading up in value gradually..... it hits $5.24. Then for hours it's $5.24 with 0 price activity.... then it's $4.97. Seems fishy here too.\n\nHave you ever found their website? I haven't. Not saying it doesn't exist, but I've never been able to find it. Is this company even real?\n\nIn my opinion, someone created the ultimate insider trading stock. A stock so difficult to Google search, not providing normal people any means to look up what yhis company is even about. No way to read news on this company either.\n\nWhat easier way to gain money than to create a fake pump and dump. No one hears of this stock before. Apps show this is the top stock making money. People FOMO. Again, no one can look up info online. Multiple media sources all claim Reddit is behind the stock going up! Remember Gamestop?! Quick! Here's your chance! You heard the media! Reddit is at it again!\n\nThen normal people lose their money when the fake oump and dump drops, thus, profiting someone else and normal people losing their money.\n\nSeems like the TOP scam.",

I told them that it was a pump and dump insider trade that wouldn\u2019t see over 100 without half of China invested. most likely government officials and employees as well as some high up Chinese citizens are the ones who banked and then the next day another Chinese stock ran 1000+% followed by a third the day after that that ran 500ish%. Im pretty sure it\u2019s all insider trading over there amongst the higher ups especially with how hard they control news and whatnot.",

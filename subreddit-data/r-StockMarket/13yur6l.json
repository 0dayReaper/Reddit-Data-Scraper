Anyone who was investing in 2008 will remember identical conversations on the validity of a crash occurring. The only real question is when this will occur. I\u2019ve been tracking business leases and there\u2019s a huge uptick in available retail space. There are also a massive amount of tax liens for residential property available-foe the first time in years. You won\u2019t feel the ripples of the macroeconomic movements from within the stock market until it\u2019s already out there and investors are reacting to the data en masse. My assessment is that a major crash will occur in 6-18 months.",

Except for the big tech stocks, the markets are down a little this year. I can\u2019t explain the enthusiasm for AI when all these products have been in development for the last 10 years. It feels like chatgpt made language models accessible when this is just an update to models that have been around for a couple years, and investors are losing there minds about it.\n\nSome things I\u2019m concerned about:\n\nAuto repos are rising. People are walking away from car notes.\n\nStudent loan repayments to commence in a few months. Consumers that are already right from inflation will have a few hundred less per month.\n\nThe commercial real estate loans on the banks books. Since the pandemic, commercial real estate isn\u2019t worth what it was.\n\nSlow down in manufacturing based on the ISM data. \n\nSlow down in container shipping.\n\nRate hikes take a long time to with their way through the economy. The scale of moving trillions of dollars around isn\u2019t days or weeks. People talk about the pause in hikes as a good thing, but no market bottom has ever occurred during a hiking cycle, they always occur after. It might be the same way this time.",

My loan payment was almost $1200 a month, that\u2019s $1200 I will no longer be spending/investing once payments resumed- personally I put my $$ in a HYSA and will lump sum the pauses payments once they resume but I know plenty of people who did not do that and will just be spending x amount less each month. \n\nThat\u2019s a LOT of economic activity being sucked out to service those loans.

They don\u2019t have the money, so they borrow it against collateral.  The quality and quantity of collateral in the system determines how much buying can happen.  In 2000-2007, they ran out of good collateral like treasuries to match their crazy borrowing, so lied to make MBS worth more.\n\nThe debt again is exploding, so what out in the economy has been used to make bad collateral again?  Student Loans as SLABS?  Commercial Real Estate?  Residential Housing?  Maybe all of them?\n\nIt really only takes one form of collateral failure to spark the domino.  Student loan payments turning back on (and therefore defaults being exposed) is happening around the time frame the yield curve thinks shit is going to blow up.  What happens when unemployment rates are high (15%) so a good portion of student loan borrows have no wage to garnish and no assets to repo?  There is a certain % of failure that when reached will ruin SLABS unless the government takes over payments.",

Rate hikes aren\u2019t close to working their way through the system as evidenced by the continued strength in demand, and despite consumer credit hitting record highs. Money supply dipping coupled with continued rates of spending and contracting producer / manufacturing numbers has resulted in continually increasing (although at a declining rate of increase) prices. \n\nMarkets are effectively pricing in a fed pivot in expectation of a slowdown. Markets a bit detached from the real economy in that there\u2019s more emphasis on monetary policy than anything else. \n\nFor the record, I have a balanced portfolio because despite all data, the outcomes are still very uncertain because it depends on what path is taken. Either the currency or asset prices will be saved, and I think indicators seem to suggest the currency will again be slowly sacrificed again to try get out of this hole, which is why we\u2019re seeing prices that we see now. The problem will then be when so many of the majority are left behind from rising prices that there is no alternative but for demand to decline.",

            "comment": "&gt;we made it through a banking crisis\n\nSmh no we didn't. The FDIC/Fed backstopped the banking sector but the underlying factors (rising rates, duration risk, leverage) is still there. Deutsche Bank just put out a note to expect more corporate debt defaults, financial stability is still iffy. \n\n&gt;The debt ceiling was raised\n\nNever an actual issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Not every inflation report has been great, but there\u2019s been an undeniable downtrend in inflation rates over the past year or two.\n\nHeadline inflation from this month backwards was .4, .1, .4, .5, .1, .2, .5. Most of that disinflation was related to energy. \n\nAlso if you analyze inflation relative to its peak at like 8 percent it seems great now, until you realize that inflation compounds. A .4 reading in 2021 is not the same as in 2023 when you consider cumulative price changes. There's a concern it could be entrenched/get worse too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If everyone believes a recession is coming by the end of the year, I\u2019m convinced that there will be no recession\n\nThis is not a thing. When groupthink says the market is going higher, nobody calls for a recession. But when it seems obviously rocky, you start seeing snake oil salesmen tell you its really about to go higher. Seems odd theres always someone trying to get you to buy what they're selling.",

Here are a few things to consider, many companies are not doing well right now (see earnings for many companies, especially retail) their guidance is not good.  Inflation is destroying consumers.  A few tech companies getting pull forward earnings is not enough to float a stock market value for all of 2023/2024. Bank problems have only just begun if Fed keep rates where they are through 2023.  Commercial loans may go under water.  China is not looking good and it could get worse.  China decides its fed up with everyone and takes Taiwan.  Climate disasters will persist and get worse; we have done nothing meaningful in that area; EV cars will not save us.  Cost of disasters is real.  The debt deal is complete and now comes the flood of treasuries to auction.  Potential downgrade of US debt is possible too. Putin decided enough is enough with purported drone attacks in Moscow and decided to level Ukraine from above; WW3.   Is that enough potential bad news for you?   That being said, we could hit new highs next week because the market has no idea what to do anymore, FOMO, AI hype, and so many optimists like you out there.",

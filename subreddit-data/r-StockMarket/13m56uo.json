Didn't see all of the minimized responses below until after I commented. Seems this is a pretty controversial issue, but I feel his mental capacity is an important issue. He's the freaking president. I think it's a very legitimate concern. This is coming from someone who isn't a fan of Trump. I'm trying to understand if people believe it's Biden himself directing executive politics or his cabinet/advisors.",

They will always have to take advice on specific topics and direct others to handle some tasks. What I'm trying to understand is if the general public believes 1- He is giving orders and directing his cabinet/advisors to pursue specific agenda's after ye has been advised. Or 2-His cabinet/advisors are the ones making the decisions and essentially directing him to pursue specific actions.",

The U.S. has never reached the point of default where the Treasury was incapable of paying U.S. debt obligations, though it has been close on several occasions.

We will all be waiting and anticipating for what happens next here.",

Schumer and Jefferies have both stated in press junkets that they are willing to come to the table and listen to both sides, that both sides have \"beliefs\" and that a compromise can be met. They underscored the tragedy that is default.\n\nSchumer in the press junket said, \"Having a bipartisan bill in both chambers is the only way we are going to avoid default.\" He is willing to make concessions as necessary.\n\nMoving to todays news for Friday, keep in mind, shortly after the Republican meeting pause this Friday, all of the GOP team got right back into that meeting room and kept going.\n\nMcCarthy has said that a deal is \"not that hard to reach\" and that he was optimistic that they were at least able to come to the table and discuss it. what McCarthy now wants is for them to \"move\". He wants them to budge. He wants the democrat side to make a few concessions, which they will.\n\nThese are two political belief systems here at odds but all under the same congress, together united. Their differences, as unwelcome as some may seem, is what make them stronger.\n\nStay tuned to the news -- we will know a lot more in only a day or two by the end of the weekend.",

It can always create more money to pay the debt.

If you don't like anyone using \"other people's money\" you should have no problem with someone receiving SS benefits.

First, it would have taken years for KXL to be fully operational, so its increased supply would have no bearing on current gas prices. Second, the 830,000 barrels of tar sands oil it would have carried daily were intended to head directly to refineries on the Gulf Coast\u2014and then likely to markets overseas.",

This leaves room for inflation to run higher than that 3-4% over a year or two before the Fed will feel pressured to raise interest rates.  The economy is going to run HOT in a world with higher inflation (which would still be low compared to historic highs) and low interest rates.  Seems to me like the bubble pop is far from here.  Sure don't invest in companies that rely solely on cheap money, but I don't see how the Fed following time honored Keynesian philosophy will result in some long term bear pressure on the whole economy... The world has long existed in periods of interest rates higher than 5%.",

Some things that do worry be is the past couple weeks rehypothecation and reverse repo's have been increasing hundreds of billions everyday and I believe last night it was close to 1/2 trillion. There is a huge liquidity issue, there is so much cash in the market that it's costing banks money to hold, they have too much cash, it's literally becoming a liability for them, and it's creating negative interest rates, which is unheard of.\n\nI believe Burry is shorting bonds in the repo market because a nasty impending crash. The repo market is the beating heart of the global financial market involving the largest banks, corporations, US Treasury and Fed. Out of all the things Burry could short, these ones scare the shit outta me.",

Right now 20yr treasuries could be going for $120. That means for every $100 you would get back at the end of the term, you paid $120. Of course there are technicalities (such as the price sitting between the max interest payout and the nominal amount), but the general behavior of bond prices are comparable to a stock. You can buy 100 20yr bonds at $120 each just like you could buy 100 shares of Apple at $120 each (just an example). He would be buying 20yr specifically because of its behavior compared to 10yr and 30yr. It\u2019s volatility would sit in between those.",

The most recent 13-F filing for Burry's Scion Capital shows he was short over $500 million in Tesla, and $170 million in long-term Treasuries via options at Q1 end.\r  \n**Why is Michael Burry Short Tesla?**\r  \nScion Capital's recent 13-F filings contained a surprising revelation \u2013 the fund is short hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Tesla stock (TSLA) via put options. Scion's founder, Dr. Michael Burry, has criticized Tesla\u2019s insane valuation in the past, but now he appears to be upping the ante and betting a significant portion of his fund that Tesla shares will fall sharply. It's clear that Tesla's stock valuation, after going up to over a $600 billion market cap in 2020, is not in any way justifiable by its underlying business. Wall Street sharks drove up the price to hustle billions of dollars from S&amp;P 500 index funds. They knew that index funds would be forced to buy Tesla shares from them, when Tesla (at the time the largest US company not in the S&amp;P 500) was eventually selected for inclusion in the index (and the higher they drove the stock, the more the index fund managers would have to pay). Scion's SEC filing also revealed large put option positions against long-term Treasuries (TLT).\r  \n**Why is Michael Burry Short Treasury Bonds?**\r  \nDr. Burry's second-largest position is a short bet against the iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT). The bet against Tesla seems highly risky. By comparison, shorting Treasuries seems like a no-brainer. The Yield on the 10-year Treasury note started the year at 0.93 percent per year (current Yield on U.S. 10 Year Treasury 1.57%). This is well below the 2.79% yield on the 10-year Treasury note in 2019. Especially since the Fed has said that they will let inflation run much higher than their target of 2.00%, so the market expects a jump in inflation. Burry specifically shorted the long end of the yield curve, which has greater downside, if yields continue to rise. Burry is cleaning up here again, with Treasury yields moving to the upside by a landslide and Treasury prices falling.",

You are counting on a bubble pop before you have paid more in rent than you would have in additional mortgage.  \n\nHousing supply is not overbuilt like in prior bubbles with low interest rates.  There are not houses out there.  The building material costs will come down some but not enough to create enough downward pressure on construction costs with the labor shortage in construction that began before Covid.  \n\nI wish you luck, but I think I would make sure you have your math right for your local real estate market long term.",

With the stimulus, lucrative rent assistance, and mortgage assistance I can't imagine that there will be a huge shock of forclosures of primary residences. What 'may' go is rental dynasties that were using poor housing stock with tenants hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nBut there have been enough winners in 2020 that those can get bought out for a future profit without much issue I think.\n\nThe only reason housing prices collapse is when rates go up, if inflation is real and persistent beyond reopening, or something massive changes that I can't forsee.",

During hunting season they just shoot any deer, fawn or any animal at that rate because they are so greedy. They shot a local man\u2019s goat because they are that cognitively impaired. I have seen them joy riding poor areas for footage to add to their YouTube channel or Instagram. I have seen them just walk right in a barn while milking as if they own the place. They truly disturb me as humans. Then they come and claim that they are helping business and we shouldn\u2019t complain...yea\n\nWhat bothers me is that geographical areas are a culture. Respect that culture.",

That said, covid definitely accelerated it. Both from people who lost work and can't afford to stay, but also wfh and people not spending on going out. Young people spend a crap ton at bars here. Its almost a social necessity for a lot of people (in their minds at least). Not going to the bars for a few months definitely made a lot of people who thought buying was out of reach realize it was possible. I've been ready to move for a while and this is a push to finally do it. Many of my friends have moved, some just to spots with more space in the boroughs, several to small towns. Most of them probably would've left within five years anyway, but I think without covid it would've taken a year or two more.",

As best I can tell it went like this:\n\n- virus created a ton of uncertainty, stocks go down\n\n- Fed lowered interest rates and began aggressive QE measures, which simultaneously made bonds less attractive and introduced a *lot* of free money into the supply. The only two places that made sense to put money was now stocks and real estate\n\n- this created something of an inflationary feedback loop, with people piling on because the price of everything in the market was going up so quickly that they needed to get in now before it went higher. We call this FOMO; the boomers who remember the \u201870\u2019s would call this inflation.\n\n- but, a lot of places that let go employees and shut down production were slower to start back up than they were to close, meaning the economy remained in recession\n\nThey say that in a true market panic, all correlates go to 1. Well, that happened here too, except after April 2020, everything panicked upward. Pick pretty much any US stock at random and you\u2019ll see the same thing: a quick dip March-April \u201820, and a rise back up and over previous levels from May onwards. \n\nThe problem is that we are still in a recession\u2014the stock market isn\u2019t the economy. So the Fed realizes this and knows it can\u2019t let off QE and low interest rates too soon, or else the market might crack again and bring down economic factors (such as employment and liquidity) with it.\n\nIn the beginning stages of the pandemic, demand went down for pretty much everything, so everyone stopped shipping supplies. Now people want to build things again, but it takes a while for the supplies to get shipped. Hence high demand, low supply, big price increases. To me, that is not inflation. That\u2019s just a Hiccup of reopening. Real inflation\u2014the upward FOMO panic\u2014already happened a year ago and is currently priced into the stock market.\n\nAgain all this is stuff I\u2019ve only learned in the last couple of months so I am in no way an authority on this, this is what I\u2019ve gathered from reading the opinions of many smarter folks than I. Anyone who wants to correct or contribute to this please do so because it means I\u2019ll get a better answer of what\u2019s Happening right now.",

Equities re-rating based on sector, rates and inflation does not drive inflation itself. The stock market is like the water in the tub, the tub itself is the bond market. Which sold off fast and hard this year giving us spikes in their yields a tell for inflation.

Fact is once the banks are released to really start taking properties again from home owners behind on their mortgages, it\u2019s gloves off. We will certainly see a glut of homes back onto the market driving down prices of new and existing homes across the nation. Am I the only one who remembers the \u201cforeclosure tours\u201d being hosted by real estate companies selling bank owned properties in states like Nevada, Florida, Texas, and California?  It\u2019s going to happen again and the folks who are buying right now will be sacked with enormous debt on houses they are upside down on. Even if they are low risk borrowers. Just my personal opinion and research lead me to these conclusions. I encourage all to do their research prior to making any financial decision.

            "comment": "One thing I can speak to is that the banking industry is indeed fearful of the current housing market.  I've heard bankers openly speculate about what will happen 2-3 years from now once the market has cooled from being red hot and the people buying now go to put their homes back on the market.  \n\nOne thing you may not be aware of is that it is becoming just accepted that in order to win a bid on a home you need to put in a price about 10-20% over asking.  This is happening on almost every home sold right now.  These houses are not being appraised for this amount and the banks are forcing waivers on home buyers that they will be responsible for this amount in any event. \n\nAs for manipulating the lumber market to control inventory, if that was their plan, they are not doing a good job.  Homebuilding has not slowed down significantly at all in my area.  It is a gold rush for the big residential developers right now.  Really only your small custom homebuilders are being affected by the lumber prices.  \n\nThe market is so hot that residential developers are building without contract right now.  This is extremely unprecedented.  The standard is for homes to be built under contract to limit risk to the developer.  But the contracts are actually a risk to the developers right now with the rising lumber prices.  They do not want to be tied to a price that will be less than their costs at the end of contract if lumber continues to shoot up.  So they are building their most efficient, profitable home models en masse, then when they are nearing completion and know their final costs, they will put the house on the market with a healthy mark-up. They too are still receiving bids over asking for these homes.  \n\nThis market is wild and no one I've talked to has ever seen anything like it, even before 2008.  It's a hard argument to say there isn't a bubble here, but at the same time the Fed pumped like dozens of trillions into the markets.   It's entirely likely that this is just the new normal with the doubled up money supply.  \n\nThere are also other reasons for lumber to be shooting up, and no it's not people all running out to Home Depot... I think that is honestly a simple explanation that only explains a very small part of the price.  I think the biggest issue is incentive changes in the timber industry itself.  Namely fuel pellets and how they encourage the growth and harvest of immature pulp wood, making it more profitable than growing mature lumber and pole timbers.",

The typical home sells in 17 days, a record low. Home prices are up a record amount, 24% year over year, to a record high. And still homes sell on average for 1.7% higher than the asking price, another record.\n\n&gt; But in two of America\u2019s largest cities, inventory has increased, in New York by 28%, in San Francisco by 77%. San Francisco hasn\u2019t had an inventory increase this large since 2008. And still in both markets, prices are increasing.\n\n&gt; In 2020, new-construction permits were *down* 13% in DC and New York, 40% in LA, 48% in Chicago, 50% in Seattle, 79% in San Francisco. Permits were *up* 25% in Miami, 56% in Vegas, 96% in Greenville, 122% in Detroit, 246% in Knoxville.\n\n&gt; Lumber prices are up 300%.\n\n&gt; In Redfin\u2019s annual survey of nearly 2,000 homebuyers, 63% reported having bid on a home they hadn\u2019t seen in person.\n\n&gt; For low-tax states, 4 people move in for every 1 who leaves. For Texas, this ratio is 5:1; for Florida, 7:1. Cites &amp; states have no leverage to raise taxes, after many promised new money for social justice; the federal government will have to fund long-term investments.\n\n&gt; The average housing budget for out-of-towners moving to Nashville was $720K, ~50% higher than locals\u2019 $485K budget. It used to be coastal elites who worried that every adult in the family had to win a career lottery, just to afford a home. Now that feeling may spread.\n\n&gt; it\u2019s not just income that\u2019s k-shaped, but mobility. 90% of people earning $100,000+ per year expect to be able to work virtually, compared to 10% of those earning $40,000 or less per year. The folks who need low-cost housing the most have the least flexibility to move.\n\n&gt; an investor recently said, with an ancient touch of awe but also greed, that one source of America\u2019s miraculous economic recovery was the bounty of \u201cthe land itself.\u201d We have more room to grow than we ever imagined.

The bulk prices they are getting are still higher than when they originally set the price of the houses. Their current discussion is, do they increase the selling prices to cover the higher costs?\n\nOther building materials are also raising in price as well.",

Well, except you. Is there anything supporting your claim?\n\nBanks have no interest in forced sales, it\u2019s quite literally the last thing they do when a client defaults. They will try just about everything prior to that. Allowing a period of interest only payments, wage garnishments, anything to cure it. It\u2019s expensive, it takes time, and they generally assume they will have to take a loss even with the sale. \n\nAnd the sales don\u2019t happen instantly. You would expect the sale to take place somewhere around nine plus months after the default. Thinking there will be an avalanche of homes on the market following June 30th is just... Wrong. \n\nSo no. Banks aren\u2019t conspiring against the lumber- and construction industries in order to get better prices for a large batch of forced sales in July. Jesus Christ.",

            "comment": "Big banks and institutions did not prop up lumber. Shortage of lumber was a result of sawmills closing down when lumber hit $250 due to it being unprofitable. A decrease in production.\n\nCovid-19 pandemic started around the same time causing a labor shortage which compounded the issue of lumber production. Then, the FED lowered rates to as low as anyone has seen to help the economy. Well, locking in all time low interest rates to build a house is keeping demand going for people buying homes but the lumber production hasn't caught up to demand.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter how high the price of homes are. It won't offset a liquidation if no one is buying cause prices are too high. People won't buy at higher levels if they cannot afford it even if prices are \"inflated by big banks.\" So that logic doesn't check out.\n\nIt would be easier and safer for banks to not take on excess risk than to prop up the market prices to theoretically absorb a price shock.",

While I\u2019m certain that The Big Banks can (and have) manipulated domestic material supply / prices, I personally doubt (to some extent) that they have enough control over international markets to coordinate something as large-scale and all-encompassing as what we\u2019re seeing now. I think it\u2019s more likely that we\u2019re facing the long term side effects of drastically decreased production due to the pandemic, various recent disruptions to international trade, and a global market that is grappling with unavoidable inflation. Just my two cents, though.",

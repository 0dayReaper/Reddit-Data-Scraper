            "comment": "401k mutual funds usually have equity in a broad range of companies. In general, if the economy goes up, then so do your shares and 401k. Ideally in the long run it grows over time and gives you a decent return for when you do retire. You should read the information pertaining to each fund offered by your employer's 401k and make your contributions as your see fit. Personally if it were my money, I would look into making my contributions to SSSYX, VIGAX, and VVIAX in no particular order. I don't really understand what SSGLX is investing in based on the information available through a quick Google search and I am not a fan of small cap funds (PRVIX).",

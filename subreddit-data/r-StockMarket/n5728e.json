I\u2019m able to use Coinbase but, Doge isn\u2019t on there. I have a feeling it\u2019s the same for a few other states as well. Also tried to get BitTorrent and Safemoon but, it\u2019s literally impossible/illegal in Texas. Therefore, since Robinhood is the only way to participate in Dogecoin, I will continue to use it. Especially with the way the stock market is performing right now. I\u2019d be negative by quite a bit if it wasn\u2019t for Doge. Holding onto my other stocks no matter what but, it\u2019s depressing to see good rated investments do badly across the board.",

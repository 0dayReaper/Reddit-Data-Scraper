However, once the value is transferred into a tangible federally-backed currency then any gains realized are subject to all the same tax codes as everything else.  The only industry that gets away with profiting off an intangible asset without having to pay taxes are churches.",

The federal government doesn't recognize it as a currency, which it is (was?) designed to operate as. \n\nThe \"federally-backed\" just means they recognize their own and other countries as currencies. All currency is some version of a fiat currency, with it's only value being the value that is placed in it but the users of said currency. There's nothing to tangible about it. The paper you get is the exact same thing as a number in a digital budget. ~~We could stop printing paper money and it wouldn't change the value of the dollar itself.~~ ETC it would change the value because idiot older generations would feel the dollar is worth less now even though nothing fundamental changed in the principle of the currency.\n\nNow I concede that crypto is volatile but in the case of currency, please point me to a historical example of a newly established currency that was not volatile.\n\nI am not a crypto enthusiast. But let's not pretend the dollar is special. People should still pay their taxes though.",

There is no basis of stability for crypto to build upon to ever leave initial volatility. Digital currencies will absolutely exist, but they are more likely to be digital extensions of current currencies working along the same monetary bases. Crypto needs to be standardized in a way that is fundamentally not possible with the current blockchain operational structure. \n\nIt\u2019s basically Dot Com Bubble 2.0.

I mean in the US we all use USD and it has value. We don't need to trade it against other currencies for it to have value. The way I see it, the fundamental basis for its value is the tax obligation. The government demands that we pay taxes in USD, which provides a baseline of demand, which is the source of the value. It has nothing to do with other currencies.

I personally am most sympathetic to the view of money as debt, and for that reason I am both fascinated by and skeptical of crypto, since there is no fundamental liability underlying it (like there is with regular fiat dollars). What do you think are the defining features of money? Can bitcoin and other cryptos be called money - regardless of their actual \"value\" or utility?",

The thing about cryptocurrency is that it's not backed by any particular government therefore only holds the value that people choose to give it, which is why it is extremely volatile. If as a collective whole people decided to just drop it because it's intrinsically worthless, it essentially becomes the same as putting money into avatar skins for a phone game app that becomes discontinued. There's absolutely nothing you can do to get that back and no recourse you can take to convert that into some other form of liquid or physical asset. \n\nBut to answer your question, in order to be money it has to be limited, accepted, and standardized (other things as well, but these are the ones that I think matter most). The fact that there are a multitude of cryptocurrencies running around with no real ability to control makes it to where it's more or less bartering rather than spending. In and of itself that's not really a bad thing, but calling it money is a major stretch.",

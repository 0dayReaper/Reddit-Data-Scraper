They are only making 1 M and Disney has bought 35% of that already in early access for development purposes. \n\nThey will sell out before they release and it is targeted for developers to build out the medium platform. Gen 3 will be the consumer targeted model. And it\u2019ll be cheaper and smaller form fitting.",

And since mr iger bought so many he wanted exclusive early adoption before any other competition. Disney imagineering has a ton of attractions and patents that are backed up that they can not put out due to the headset limitations. It actually makes a lot of sense why Disney and apple made a deal here. Disney parks and other products have a huge demand for that type of headset along with what the attractions are. Believe me at imagineering we tried with oculus and magic leaps, everything fell short and this was developed with imagineering demands in mind.\n\nAlso, note that covid has really changed the idea of sharing a head set and having them cleaned at the parks. There\u2019s going to be the park you enjoy now and the park you can enjoy with the apple head set.\n\nJust letting you know. That announce from Bob iger at the release is just a formality from how many head sets he already bought. So the idea that no one is going to buy them is already not valid. Bob iger bought them for imagineering",

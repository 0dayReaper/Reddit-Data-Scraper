    "postText": "Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood added to her\u00a0Coinbase\u00a0holding Tuesday, unfazed by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s charges against the crypto exchange.\n\nWood snapped up 329,773 shares of Coinbase for her\u00a0flagship\u00a0ARK Innovation ETF\u00a0in the previous session when the stock tumbled more than 12%. She also added 53,885 shares for\u00a0ARK Next Generation Internet ETF as well as another 35,666 shares for Ark Fintech Innovation ETF. Combined, these purchases were worth more than $21.6 million based on Coinbase\u2019s closing price of $51.61.\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase in New York federal court on Tuesday morning, alleging that the company was acting as an unregistered broker and exchange and demanding that the company be \u201cpermanently restrained and enjoined\u201d from continuing to do so.\n\nTuesday\u2019s sell-off trimmed Coinbase\u2019s 2023 gains to about 45%. The stock rebounded in 2023 after an abysmal 2022 that saw an 86% decline.\n\nThe crypto exchange is now ARKK\u2019s sixth biggest holding with a 5.35% weighting. The innovation investor has been periodically adding to her Coinbase bet this year.\n\nWood has been sticking with\u00a0her bold call on bitcoin\u00a0despite the regulatory crackdown in the crypto industry. The ARK Invest chief sees the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency hitting about $1.3 million by 2030. Bitcoin trades below $27,000 currently.\n\nThe longtime crypto bull believes the price of bitcoin will surge if companies and institutional investors diversify their cash holdings with digital currencies.\n\nWood previously said the collapse of FTX is bullish for the industry as it would push the crypto space to be more transparent.\n\nThe SEC also sued Binance and its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, this week, alleging that they worked to attract U.S. customers to its unregulated international exchange, commingled investor funds with their own and violated securities laws.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/07/cathie-wood-hikes-her-coinbase-stake-by-more-than-20-million-during-sec-fueled-plunge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/07/cathie-wood-hikes-her-coinbase-stake-by-more-than-20-million-during-sec-fueled-plunge.html)\n\nArk Invest\u2019s (ARKK) Cathie Wood added 329,773 shares of Coinbase worth around $20 million yesterday when the stock tumbled more than 12% on SEC's charges against the crypto exchange. What are your thoughts on this move by Cathie Wood?",

I tried to get customer support to figure it out, but they don't have a phone center. \n\nThrough weeks of email they just gave me the run around and tried to blame it on fluctuating exchange rates, while also advertising that once you initiate a trade you have 30 seconds or a minute or something where they'll hold the quoted price while you enter the details. \n\nTheir exchange system was also designed (at the time, I haven't used them in ages) to be as confusing as possible inasmuch as there was no fiat conversion once you got into the actual trading screen. So, under time pressure you had to do the math on 1000.099573 Xcrypto to 473.009838 Ycrypto then convert to dollars if you wanted to figure out what the trade was actually going to be. \n\nI never put a lot of money in so I didn't lose much, but still, if I'm exchanging $25 of Bitcoin for $25 of Ripple, for example, once the exchange is done, I expect to see $25 ripple minus a 1.5% fee at the end, not $13 ripple, minus a 1.5% fee.\n\nMaybe I'm too dumb for crypto, which is what the \"customer support\" essentially tried to gaslight me into believing, but if it's that much of a hassle to trade literally anything and I leave feeling as if I got hustled, I don't want to deal with it anyway and they can fuck right off.",

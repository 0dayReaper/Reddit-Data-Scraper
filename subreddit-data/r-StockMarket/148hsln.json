I lost too much money picking my own stocks so I stick to something like what you have.",

This way, you smooth out any of the s&amp;p gyrations. (You already have s&amp;p 500 and whole market fund as the bulk of your investments, so perhaps leaving it alone could be a good idea)\n\nIf you are pessimistic that a recession is coming and you need to generate cash, maybe try a 6% preferred shares , although the tax on the dividend is gonna bite. Preferred shares are almost always around $25 a share and should give a yield of 5-7% annual. Eg. MS-PE or WFC-P. But I would suggest reading up on the intricacies of preferred share investing. \n\nIf you are speculative, bet on black.",

I will eventually get a hang of it. I see my dividends are being invested back into the pot. Does that mean that\u2019s my money to keep even if things go down? So many questions lmao sorry!",

His philosophy was that  rather than buy specific stocks why not buy the indexes. Eg. S&amp;P 500 returned 12-15% compounded annually. And instead of buying it one time, spread your purchases over time from your monthly savings into the indexes. \n\nYou can read more about him here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle\n\n(If this is a sound investment philosophy, then why aren\u2019t more people into it? Well there are, but people are people and everyone thinks they can beat the market aka S&amp;P 500 )",

Everyone seems to remember MRVL and MCHP even though they are \"tiny\" and semi-significant.\n\nYet barely anyone remembers Texas Instruments with 154B MC and Analog Devices with 91.5B MC. Both are cheaper on TTM PE than most of the companies on this list.",

I'm not saying they should be &lt;22, but 50 and 60s is astronomical if you expect any type of long term return in these equities. Have you sat around and done the calculation for their market cap on their \"outlook\" or what people think they will have to buy right now and get a consistent &gt;12% basic S&amp;P 500 return? For 5 yrs, for 10 yrs? We're talking about multiple trillions. I'm sorry but buying into half of these right now is just setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nThat's not taking a single bit of margin of safety into consideration, a potential long term bear market with every single economic metric off the charts, or a potential deep/hard recession in the next 6-12 months that getting more and more into reality. Hell, the Q's and the top 7 equities are floating our entire market at the moment and those are trading with a consistent RSI of &gt;70 for weeks &amp; months &amp; years charts. Look at the S&amp;P 500 to GDP calculations and valuations. We're talking about the longest running over valuation since 2017 to now. The height of 2000 \"bubble\" was around 55% \"overvalued\".. Right now on those same projections and calculations, we're &gt;75% \"overvalued\". I'm not saying that growth equities have to run at Value Investor fundamentals, but if you don't think this is a bubble already based on YoY numbers and the large amount of negative economic projections then you are in the wrong forum. You lost your way from the WSB group haha!\n\n\\*On a side note, this is not a personal attack my friend. I consider us both fighters for money and I do wish the best to both of us and may we all do well in our investments and endeavors.",

Not necessarily just the individual segments. Although the individual segments may be the proposition for growth, it's not the only part of the company. \n\nEssentially, you'll need to deep dive into each of these companies to properly compare them.\n\nEven better, do you properly understand the business? For example, do you know what a wafer is vs. a microchip or the history of microchips and their use in the market? Do you fully understand and appreciate the technology?

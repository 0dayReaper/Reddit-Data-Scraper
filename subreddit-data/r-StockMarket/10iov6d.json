Here is the response:   \nThe meme shows four kids playing with toy cars. The first kid had the inside info, which means he knew something important about the market that others didn\u2019t. Maybe he heard a rumor that a big company was going to buy a lot of Bitcoin, or that a new law was going to make crypto more popular. He used this information to buy some crypto before the price went up, and then sold it when it was high. He made a lot of profit.  \nThe second kid in blue used a stop loss, which is a tool that helps you limit your losses if the price goes down2. He set a price at which he would automatically sell his crypto if it reached that level. For example, if he bought Bitcoin at $50,000 and set his stop loss at $45,000, he would sell his Bitcoin if it dropped below $45,000. This way he would only lose $5,000 instead of more.  \nThe last two kids are future WSB members, which is a reference to r/wallstreetbets , a subreddit where people gamble on risky stocks and options. They didn\u2019t use any strategy or logic when buying crypto; they just followed the hype and bought whatever was popular or trending. They didn\u2019t care about the risks or the fundamentals; they just wanted to make quick money by following memes and influencers. They probably lost most of their money when the market crashed.  \n\n\nSource: [Investing in cryptocurrency](https://blog.coinjupiter.com/factors-to-consider-before-investing-in-crypto/)",

My physical AU/AG is my best performing asset class so far. Had I bought crypto. I would be not doing well. The other thing AU/AG and BTC.X have in common. You don't hold it. You don't own it. I like the Scrooge McDuck feel I get from having a fair amount of physical gold and silver. It's about 25-33% of my portfolio. Low cost index fund investing through a 401k,  is about 45% and the remaining amount is between a Roth IRA and a Brokerage. Crypto mining stocks are about as far as I can go with BTC.X. Asset allocation, position sizing. Only invest what you're willing to lose",

So the instant drop is more accurate in this video, it can go up as quick as it goes down, and it frequently does. \n\nThere's also no daily limit to crypto transactions and the market is open 24/7 so \"day trading\" is very popular. After a while you get greedy though, and start making $20,000 bets instead of $500 bets that doge coin for example, will go up 5% by the end of the day, because you've seen it happen many times before. \n\nYou've done this before with $500 and made an easy $25, so why not do it with $20,000 and make $1000 in one day. You try it, and succeed. After making $1000 in a day, it's hard to never try it again. And then one day, you put $20,000 in and make $8000 in one day because it unexpectedly spikes. \n\nNow you think you're a pro, and you now also have $28,000 to \"invest\"/gamble. So you put that $28,000 in, and the stonk unexpectedly drops 20% over night, you think it'll raise back up by tommorow morning though, so you go to bed and wake up to see that it dropped another 30%. \n\nIt hurts like hell, but you can't sell, otherwise you'd lose $14,000 in a matter of 30 hours. You pray that it'll go back up, but now it only keeps on going down. \n\nIt has now been 7 months and you're now down 75% and have \"$28,000\" tied up in crypto that you won't touch for the foreseeable future. \n\nEven after all this, you still believe that you'll get your $28,000 back someday, and most likely even more if you don't sell it for a very long time, because you've seen this as a trend in past crypto times. \n\nThis is how crypto gamblers become crypto investors. Aka this is how I cope with my fuck up",

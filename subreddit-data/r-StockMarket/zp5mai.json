It turns out yeah they're just a car company that produces an incredibly small volume of cars each year. No wonder why theyre dropping like a lead balloon. Did people really think other car companies can't provide their own elective vehicles?",

I'm not saying I agree with that, but I think it was at least one of the reasons people were speculating on Tesla.",

Their businesses will only become more valuable as an asset. Elon, knowing this, was able to get people to ignore the real discrepancies between Tesla balance sheets and Tesla market prices.\n\nNow, people have alternatives. Other car manufacturers are committing to transition fully to electric. And they don\u2019t have manufacturing issues and delays to the extent that Tesla does. Tesla might grow, but that doesn\u2019t make its current price a fundamentally good buy.",

                    "comment": "&gt;noob question - why does Musk's purchase of Twitter affect Tesla?\n\nPart of it is the financing. Elon Musk pledged like 90 million Tesla shares to finance the deal. I believe it's one of the largest debt against shares to pay for another company.  But that company also has a history of bleeding money. On top of that, Twitter's business model is an advertising model and Elon's first order of business has been to drive off prominent advertisers. \n\nPart of it is Tesla also has an identity-based loyalty. That is, people who buy their cars do it based on their perceived shared values and what the brand represents. But, those same people may stop forgiving the bad quality, wonky delays in ordering, bad service, etc., if they believe their \"tech genius\" of Musk is being too distracted. Part of the identity has been forged by people who are enamored by Musk himself. \n\nBut, Twitter's ownership is showing a much different side of Elon. Elon has been criticizing Democrats (those buying electric vehicles are 2:1 in favor of Democrats), is turning Twitter into a far-right haven, etc.\n\nPart of it is going to be uncoupled from Twitter, but just headwinds against Tesla in general. I think a fairly large part of those who speculated for Tesla, or wanted to value Tesla less like a traditional automaker and more like a tech company, may pull out now that we know full self driving is likely not ever going to happen. That combined with the fact that traditional auto makers are all going to be flooding the market with EVs in the next decade.",

    "postText": "1) Here are the brief stats on Home Depot Earnings Report\n\nYOY Revenue % decline: 4.2%\n\nYOY Net income % decline: 8.5%\n\nYOY EPS % decline: 6.6%\n\n2) Guidance: they mentioned full 2023 EPS was expected to be down 7 to 13% of 2022 EPS\n\n3) Home Depot cited declining lumber prices as a reason for its revenue decline. Here is an image to show how lumber prices have fallen: [https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png)\n\nThe units are USD per 1000 Board ft\n\nGenerally, when lumber prices fall, it's a sign of poor economic health. When looking at lumber companies, some have mentioned a decline in single-family starts as a reason for their decline in revenue. Companies like Boise Cascade have reported revenue declines of 34% YOY and companies like Weyerhauser reported a 71% decline in revenue YOY.\n\n4) The Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIn this spreadsheet, the first tab shows historic quarterly revenue and the %yoy increase or decrease. Here you can see that there are really only a few years where Home Depot reported a negative quarter YOY decline\n\nTo the right, I have TTM and FEPS. TTM stands for trailing 12 months which is the 4 most recent quarters of EPS added together. FEPS stands for Forward EPS which I was able to calculate using their 2023 EPS guidance. For this calculation, I multiplied 2022 EPS by 90% to represent the mid between the 7% to 13% decline in EPS for this year.\n\nHistoric EPS on the conservative side tends to be around 15 to 17 as found on MACRO Trends. Currently, we are around 17 PE using TTM EPS. Using FEPS, we are around 19 PE. Personally, I think we're a bit overpriced. Below that, I show the current dividend yield. In the Next tab over, I show their dividend history and how their dividend has grown over time. Home Depot is really well known for its amazing dividend growth. \n\nI forecast different price points based on either PE multiples or technical supports and show what dividend yield will look like currently, 1 year out, and 2 years out assuming a 10% yearly dividend growth forecast.\n\nHere are the technicals for HD to go along with the spreadsheet: [https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png)\n\nThe blue line is an anchored VWAP from the all-time highs.\n\nIf you are interested in Home Depot stock, this may help you decide where fair value is and what your future dividend gains may look like. Also keep in mind if we see another housing boom with interest rate cuts, companies like Home Depot are likely to benefit yet again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you all enjoyed\\~",

Economy is tightening, rate hikes and higher prices means less spending in renovations and capital preservation. Less people are buying houses now.\n\nIt\u2019s not rocket science. \n\nPerhaps I\u2019m missing something but that\u2019s the way I see it. Demand should recover eventually, perhaps in 2024. Short term, I\u2019m not seeing a price recovery.\n\nMore than happy to hear if my thought process is flawed.",

Eventually when the rates fall and people refinance, we'll see more shuffling and demand should pick up. For now, just look for opportunities on these cyclical stocks and pay attention to dividend yields. Treasuries are great, but they don't offer up growth in dividend payments like HD does.",

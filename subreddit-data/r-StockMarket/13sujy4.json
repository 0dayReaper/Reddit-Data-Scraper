    "postText": "Congratulations if you are one of the lucky few who aped in at new all time highs this week in NVDA in the middle of an otherwise deep bear market! You have provided great exit liquidity for those of us who bought last year and are now selling for 100% + gains. Thank you for your service. \n\nConsidering the market has been propped up by five mega cap stocks and a singular sector (semiconductors) due to AI mania, I\u2019ll be protecting capital over the summer while the regards in Washington force a default due to their own incompetence. Have a great weekend all!",

If I had to guess she probably sold because NVDA fundamentally is over priced based on their previous estimates.  Their new Q estimates are better but still don\u2019t justify its market cap.   I am not a Woods fan but most people continue to believe NVDA is overpriced.   It will take a few more Q reports to show the truth now.",

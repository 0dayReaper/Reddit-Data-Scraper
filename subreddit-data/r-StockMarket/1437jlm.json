    "postText": "You might have noticed that in yesterday\u2019s trading session, Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) was down -12.09%.\u00a0\n\nWhat accounts for the sudden drop in stock price? As it turns out, the SEC announced that they\u2019re moving to sue the crypto exchange for running an \u201cunregistered securities exchange\u201d. Interestingly, this news follows an announcement that the SEC is going after another crypto exchange, Binance, for a similar issue.\u00a0\n\nSo what\u2019s the bigger picture here? It seems that the crackdown on Coinbase is part of a larger crackdown in the crypto world. The whole idea of crypto as a medium of exchange is that it circumvents any type of government regulation. However, it is apparent that this will have to change if the industry is to survive.\u00a0\n\nAre you going to buy the dip on Coinbase? What are your thoughts on the Crypto industry as a whole?",

They were the only one to embrace SEC scrutiny when they registered as a public company.\n\nMore likely change that binance and other crypto exchanges that aren\u2019t registered are doing something not so great\n\nI\u2019m selling some puts at open",

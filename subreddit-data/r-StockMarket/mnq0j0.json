Remember that citadel the market maker processes trillions in securities transactions a year. They\u2019re bound to make mistakes. When you actually go and read the violations a lot of them are for small things like labeling a transaction wrong, or an employee using their personal cell phone to call someone while on the NYSE floor. Some of the violations are because of software and coding glitches. Some are more egregious like not routing orders correctly or failing to give the best price for a large order. But what all this shows us is just how heavily regulated the securities market is and that FINRA is doing its job. 60 violations in 14 years is actually not that much. Especially when at least half of them are because of things like employee error.\n\nFrom my experiences working with people I\u2019ve come to realize that humans make a lot more mistakes than we realize. Even the most professional of humans working the most professional of jobs. I\u2019ve seen surgeons leave instruments inside patients. Engineers stress test a bridge in the middle of the day and it collapses. \n\nThe dude who wrote that DD and all his other DDs are based off of grand conspiracies that the entire market is about to fall apart. All of his posts look like that Charlie from it\u2019s always sunny meme.",

They just don\u2019t understand what 330,000,000 people looks like and how it functions.\nOn Friday alone GME had a volume of 9.35 million shares traded. That\u2019s one security on one day of the year. Estimations put the total volume on the NYSE at 2billion-6billion a day. Then there is the options market. Then there is the futures market. Then there is the bond market. It\u2019s estimated that citadel handles 1/3 of all stock trades and 25% of the options market. With that much volume violations are bound to happen. I am actually kind of shocked that they don\u2019t have more violations.\n\nI\u2019m not citadel fan, I am neutral towards them but I do understand that they provide a very necessary service and function to the streamlined flow of the markets. I am literally waking up in the morning and pushing buttons on my phone and buying securities while in bed. A combination of multiple companies and organizations allow this to happen with citadel being one of them; it doesn\u2019t just happen on its own. \n\nOne negative thing about citadel: The market maker and hedge fund need to be completely separated. It creates a huge conflict of interest having a hedge fund possibly being able to see things about order flow that no one else can see. But then again I don\u2019t really know if there are regulations in place to prevent this.",

As I said, my company fucks up, we're gone. Someone else comes in and finishes the job. We definitely aren't going to get to fuck up 60 times and still keep the gig. Also, the \"other people are doing it so it's ok\" response is not an answer. Rules are in place for a reason, and when one group can violate them at a whim with no actual repercussions, you better believe they will abuse the fuck out of it. The sheer number of repeat violations is proof of that. \n\nWhen a fine can be rolled into the cost of doing business, it's no longer a fine. IDGAF if the whole market needs to get shut down and reorganized, this shit is inexcusable, and to act like it's no big deal is just adding to the problem.",

But nowadays the sub is just filled with BS made up stories how surely it will still go up. \"Ya this new ceo will make the company go up x10\" or \"those new shares are good for the stock price\" \"this new product line will change everything\". The fact is holding GME at its current value is only interesting if the short squeeze will happen. Then you might make some money on it. If it doesn't then the current share price is way to high. The company has to increase their profits or grow 1000% to earn it's current valuation. That isn't realistic in a short time period. and let's be honest all these people are just on it for the quick money.",

The price of GME hasn\u2019t been based on the strict earnings, assets and management of the companies for a long time now. It\u2019s a battle between large hedge funds wanted to drive it into the ground like they did Toys R Us and an army of retail investors who are saying no. I do think the company is in a much stronger position now than in the last few years for sure. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think I can evaluate the share price like it\u2019s any other retail stock. If I was building a value stock portfolio I wouldn\u2019t include it, but it\u2019s fun to speculate on. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt the resolve of the WSB apes, but I also don\u2019t have full confidence that large institutions will play fair and take their L. So I\u2019ve stayed out of GME and threw some lunch money at AMC for kicks. My AMC shares are something I am 100% ok with losing but it\u2019s fun to watch.  \n\nTL;DR I think there\u2019s a lot of different perspectives to utilizing the market whether it\u2019s value investing, day trading, options trading, big growth speculation or simple dividend collecting. Each stock will be better and worse for different strategies.",

But last I\u2019ve seen is they still call it a brick-and-mortar store and some guy known for \u2018dog food\u201d is on the board. Why they insist on that tired argument no one can really say. Maybe if they took an objective view and got out of a 2019 way of thinking they\u2019d see its potential. But, it\u2019s the stock market and even the \u201cprofessional\u201d traders are wrong most times. All speculative or else we\u2019d all be ungodly wealthy out doing ungodly wealthy hobbies and not posting on Reddit. So who can really say? I think it\u2019s worth the price currently, sure.",

The business model has changed from what it was in 2019 and what seems to be what everyone that opposes GME seems to be hanging their hat on. \n\n* It\u2019s making the walk-in stores more of a meeting place for gamers that will also include PC build kiosks, VR gaming capacity, knowledgeable staff to assist with product information, along with some of the items they have exclusive rights to in the $159B annual gaming industry.   \n\n* Stores will also act as a shipping hub for same day shipping orders assisted by Doordash.   \n\n* E-commerce for those that may not feel the need to go into physical store but rather order items online. Some like a physical copy too though and you can order console bundles online (Imagine once the global microchip shortage subsides and consoles are a plenty). Collectible items ordered through here. Exclusive gaming rights and other downloads. This part of the business model is what is really going to allow the company to adapt to things given the success of Amazon Prime, STEAM, VR gaming, etc.\n\nI\u2018m likely missing some other changes the company has in the works but hopefully the recent hires make a lot more sense to you now. Either way, as you can see, it\u2019s no longer just a \u201cbox store in a mall being run by a guy known for success in dog food. Derp\u201d Business models change. They adapt in order to stay relevant. And as you can also see, the company has a pretty good 2-3 generations backing it. And likely why you hear the Boomers pundits confused by an evolving tech world. They don\u2019t understand bc they don\u2019t really care about video games so probably why you hear them with tired outdated arguments as these are the same people that struggle with their smart phone apps acting like they don\u2019t understand how any of this makes sense.

And GameStop has only made moves to prove they are looking to be the \"Amazon of gaming\", including offering PC parts. As with all stocks, it is a risk, and I am not one who threw everything I had at it, only what I was willing to lose. But if you are dabbling in stocks, why not at least pick up a couple of shares of the most exciting thing to happen to the stock market, possibly ever, and hold to see what happens?",

GameStop just started streaming on Twitch and they have been active on Twitter, they can capture a young market if this all plays out the way people are expecting. \n\nOne other thing that actually provides a chance at least competing with Amazon is their next day/same day shipping. Some GameStops offer same day shipping, mine is next day. They also offer free delivery on orders over $35. \n\nLike I said, there is risk involved, but that is the stock market.

Besides quite a few companies offer it, it\u2019s a feature of modern day shipping. In my opinion they don\u2019t have a USP. \n\nMore people now know about GME, absolutely, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate to an increase in sales. \n\nIt looks like a fresh start for a company, certainly. Hopefully they can make it work. However we need to consider that at current price (ignoring the chance of a squeeze) GME is trading at around 40x the price of one year ago. Does offering same day delivery and streaming on twitch suggest 40x growth in revenues or profits? I would suggest not. \n\nI can\u2019t say what you or anyone should do with your money, but this is my reasoning why I won\u2019t buy GME and I think others should consider it too.",

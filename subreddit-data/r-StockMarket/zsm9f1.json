Pay $25 million fine.\n\nKick off the opioid epidemic by bribing doctors and using illegal sales tactics and kill 50,000 people with an additional $700 billion in economic damages and net $10 billion in personal wealth in the process? $6 billion dollar fine.\n\nRun Theranos and defraud wealthy investors? A decade in jail.\n\nSo to me, this really all comes down to who she defrauded.  If a lot of rich people lost their shirts in this, she's fucked.

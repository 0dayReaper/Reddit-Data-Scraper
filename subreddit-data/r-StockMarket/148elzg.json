The growth of the market over the past 100 years has been based on oil. It will keep going up until we hit fundamental biophysical limitations of our planet. End of oil. Resource and energy shortages. Climate change. Energy crisis spurred by end of oil and attempt to electrify and keep current economy, but at lower energy density.\n\nI.e. this looks \"good\" because we've collectively mined our earth, not just resources, but ecology (trees, animals, soils). We are heat junkies who are burning our house down for heat, and saying we've never been more cozy. Meanwhile, winter is coming.",

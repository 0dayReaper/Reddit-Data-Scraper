High div is great but remember that any dividend payout is profit that the business isn't reinvesting back into itself. So it may be wise to go low dividend too\n\nRight with you on the 1k Road my freind and I wish you the best luck for the future",

Amazon isn\u2019t going away anytime soon and it will likely rally past its 2021 high by next year. AWS is gaining massive traction and they just announced they are launching a telecom service to compete with Verizon, t-mobile and Att. I could go on and on but the point is Amazon is not just an online marketplace they put their money into different revenue streams constantly.",

You can just look at their history of business they got into to give you an idea how successful they are to adapting and taking over business areas. As far as their space ventures, if it wasn\u2019t for world governments giving them contracts I would be very concerned about it. Kind of like how when Virgin decided to get into space tourism and everyone knows how that went. Once their drone program goes live for deliveries (they have been working on this for like 5 years now) it will boost them because now they don\u2019t need human drivers for packages. That being said, I think the drone tech won\u2019t be realistic for at least 10 more years. The thing about growth stocks is they are only growing and have high valuation if investors think the company in the future will be way more profitable. Amazon checks all those boxes!",

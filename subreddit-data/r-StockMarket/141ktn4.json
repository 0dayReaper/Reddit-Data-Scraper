    "postText": "Had to sell RIOT and CCJ today. Up 160% and 33% respectively.\n\nBought XLE.\n\nI knew that OPEC would cut since last week. It may help create a floor. The real rationale is that the war consumes \\~6million barrels more a day than supply. This crunch is expected, not just by me but other major oil trading firms, to hit the market by about August and September.\n\nNo one is expecting crazy returns from oil so I'll probably sell covered calls as soon as I'm up 5% or 10%.\n\nI'll sell credit put spreads underneath (leverage the long) until it starts to move upward. I'll fight those levered longs as low as it goes, taking more profit by adding buying power and time as needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is how you make money**",

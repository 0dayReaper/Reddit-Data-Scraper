Decentralized in the sense that the \u201ccurrency\u201d could be generated by anyone with the right resources, but completely pigeonholed into exchanges and virtual banking institutions due to its value still being measured with fiat currency.  Crypto outside exchanges and other financial institutions doesn\u2019t really require regulation because it\u2019s value is deemed by the holder and the buyer.  Once crypto becomes interwoven with fiat currency through financial institutions, it becomes a financial asset tied to market values.   That does require regulation simply due to the impact it can have on a much wider population of stakeholders.  However, the value of cryptocurrency is by design, 100% speculative and not backed by anything.  So injecting to into financial markets as a tradable asset secured and backed by a centralized institution literally defeats the entire purpose of crypto in the first place.  \n\nSo what the fuck is she taking about?",

Crypto is tied to meaningless calculations and values in a list that just say who has what. If a hack came out that make all crypto worth zero tomorrow, nothing would change for nearly anybody. I suppose the black market would need a new way to do commerce, or would have to go back to sacks of US dollars.",

If there was a massive stock market crash for irrational reasons, their value would go down too and a lot of them would get swept up in hostile takeovers. A lot of them will end up going out of business because of their inability to security financing with their new company valuations. \n\nIf crypto goes poof, pundits just have one less thing to talk about.",

Focus on your banking system and currency before you start trynna control crypto, however it\u2019s probably their only way out at this point, they fucked the dollar and there\u2019s nothing to fall back on (expect crypto ofc), probably just concerned about BRICS plans to over throw the USD, which at this point I would even mind.",

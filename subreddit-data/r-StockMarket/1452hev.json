    "postText": "It's a serious question. I've been thinking this for a while now. The past few years I've just been buying and holding because I can't trade worth shit. I literally almost never win. Buy high, sell low, that describes about 85% of my trades. And the trades I do win on are very small wins while the losing trades are almost always huge.\n\nIn a market where the odds of going up are higher than going down, you have to be a special kind of regarded to consistently end up on the wrong side.\n\nProblem is, the stock market is not truly random. It's not blackjack. People are buying or selling. Funds are buying and selling. It moves based on market psychology but trader psychology must be different in order to lose more than win, as most traders do. But maybe we can say there is a lot more randomness in the short term.\n\nThe interesting thing is that in order to end up on the wrong side so often, there has to be something somewhere deep in the subconscious that is causing me to trade in or out at the wrong time. If you're winning 85%, you aren't just lucky. You \\*know\\* when to trade in and out.\n\nConversely, if you lose 85% of the time, you ALSO know when to trade in or out. It \\*can't\\* be chance. You DO know. Your brain is responding to signals. The only problem is that the conscious mind is doing the opposite. lol. But right or wrong, if it's 85% of the time, then deep in your brain, it knows what to do. It's the conscious mind that gets in the way.\n\nAnd it's not just me. It seems the vast majority do the same thing.\n\nMy first thought was maybe I have a bias where I just remember the loses more than the wins, but my account balance is proof that whether I'm remembering correctly or not, the end result is a lot more losses. lol\n\nI've tried doing a George Costanza, but that is impossible. You can't reverse yourself because your mind fills with doubt. \"Oh, I want to buy now, so I shouldn't buy now. OK, now I would never buy this high, so let's buy now! Oh shit, it's way down, I should sell. No don't sell, it's a trick! Oh shit, it went down another 30%. I need to cut losses and sell. Wtf? News came out and it jumped 40%?\" etc etc etc\n\nIt seems that buying and selling when you feel is right is actually wrong and trying to do the opposite is also wrong (and leads to being committed in an asylum).\n\nBut again, if you're getting 85% wrong, you ARE beating the odds, and something is causing you to make bad trades that consistently.\n\nSo what is it? What, exactly, is happening to cause people to lose more than chance could ever explain?",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re going to trade you have to be willing to take short term losses. For instance if you wanted to rotate currently between safety picks (XLP, XLV, XLU) and growth stocks (IWM, XLK, XLC) you\u2019re never going to be able to time the bottom perfectly. Most traders get to afraid to buy into a hole and so they end up chasing tops. If you want to trade you need to have an understanding of why rotations happen, some signs they are getting extreme in a direction, as well as just some basic macro information about different sectors. Also a lot of people get to greedy, myself included. For instance right now I\u2019m sitting on Lilly with a 35% increase from when I bought a few months ago. I realize I should sell and just take profits, but it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s up like that because that\u2019s a lot of house money you\u2019re playing with. The best traders can turn that emotion off.",

            "comment": "You are trying to make money quickly. You do not understand fear and greed which is natural since we don\u2019t realize it ourselves. Greed is what usually starts us with optimism and hope. Fear is what causes us to start thinking \u201c what if \u2026\u201d.  You also don\u2019t understand that the markets run daily on news and the world news. Government reports run the markets daily often with sometimes \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d enter the markets which make a good day turn into a bad day or a bad day into an up day.  Unless you are first or buying and holding you must wait for the moment to buy or sell.  You can not buy in a situation where fear or greed dissipates so quickly. That\u2019s why we have bear markets and bull markets.  The majority leads those markets every time. Right now we have equal weights of both. Trust me. Bad news will take these markets down fast as they are going up somewhat cautiously. Just a few areas are producing good results. Even oil, which everyone said was going up is not performing the way it should. Everyone is cautious. Be patient and stop trying to make money so quickly. There will be a time when you can actually figure out the correct direction that the markets will head, for at least a few years. Good luck",

You can enter low but stil lose if the stock comes back to ur price and lower and u dont play defense. Or the next time the same situation happens, you'll decide to play defense and exit at ur entry price but then the stock rockets up. \n\nYou can enter high chasing a stock which is common and known as FOMO.

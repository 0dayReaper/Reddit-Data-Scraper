If you bought Danaher at the same time you would\u2019ve made 2300x your money. What did Danaher make back then? Water pumps. Or what about Microsoft if you had held it from IPO to today? You would\u2019ve made 3300x your money. Excellent! But if you had bought Monster Energy at the same time you would\u2019ve made 5700x your money. More recently, if you had bought Meta IPO in 2012 you would\u2019ve made 6x your money. Pretty good, until you consider you would\u2019ve made 10x had you bought Dominoes at the same time. Point is, you never know which stocks will outperform and which stocks will won\u2019t. Would be good to be a bit more humble.",

Many of those claims are indeed scammy and overpromising on performance that will never be delivered. They are intended to sell AI-related products and reports or pump up stock (and companies have been doing this themselves by tacking AI onto their products, even if they don't really fit or there are dubious copyright issues.)\n\nThe problem - as has been repeatedly demonstrated - is that even ChatGPT 4 often just makes things up. You can find situations that it is completely unfamiliar with and it ends up confidently guessing something wrong.\n\nWhile it is useful for solving certain types of people-facing problems, you also need to recognize that it has limits and there are things it cannot do. That is where the scams are.",

And citing them demonstrates an exceedingly limited understanding of the technology. AI technologies will most definitely, within the next decade, lead to us needing to address certain aspects of our economy because of the breadth of tasks that I, as a single developer, can now fairly easily automate in a few months if you give me a salary and a $10,000 GPU. Stuff that would have taken me a year or more in the past (and that's assuming that it was possible at all).",

True it's not a lot of money, but I have a feeling most of the \"worrywarts\" on here have less than $5000 in their \"portfolios \".\n\nI was an idiot and never cared until I was about 38 and blew everything I made. \n\nHouse is small and almost paid off at $900 a month mortgage. So that's my only plus in life.\n\nPlus my Nana passed at 92 and left me about $100k .\n\n\n\nI mean. Sorry but if you're 25 and have less than $10k. You shouldn't even be on Herr. You should just be in an index and upping your savings rate and getting on with life.\n\nI plan on working as long as I can and then may never be able to ever retire from some part time job.\n\nI'll most likely die at work unfortunately.\n\nI mean a 25 year old worried about losing 50% of $10000 needs to evaluate some things. \n\n$50000 today is peanuts!\n\nUntil you even hit $120k, you shouldn't even be bitching. You should be furthering your career, moving out of moms basement, and working your azz off!\n\nCause believe me, once you hit 40, life is A LOT harder!",

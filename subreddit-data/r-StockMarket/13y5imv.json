    "postText": "I gave up a while ago trying to use collars and protective puts. The strategies made no sense to me at some point, the nuances of which I forgot some time ago. Basically I stopped seeing value in them.\n\nThe likely reason is that let's say you are afraid your stock would go down so you pay $5 for a protective put. The stock goes down $5 as you thought and then stays there and your put expires worthless because everyone thought the same thing which is why the puts were worth $5 in the f\\*\\*king first place. You paid $5 for no protection and raised your cost basis by $5.\n\nDo this enough times and you end up breaking even at best meaning you just held your stock to the bottom anyway, and at worst you ended up paying MORE for the pleasure of losing money.\n\nI make about 50 trades a month so ... I have a lot more personal experience with two things I think most people take for granted:\n\n* Scalability\n* Compoundabilty\n\nNobody should really care if you have different experiences in an account where in your entire lifetime you've traded less than I probably do in a single week.\n\nYes I realize anecdotes are not \"valid\" - but good luck getting my results from your backtesting and paper trade practicing.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe collar is just a screwy version of the protective put, where you think if you get a zero cost you have improved protection but the same rules above apply only now you cap your gains - usually so that you are called away at a break even price or it hits the put and stalls and you get little protection and noting much really changed so why did you put the trade on in the first place.\n\nIn my experience over thousands of trades...if you want to protect equity just sell out of the position.\n\nBut this isn't a thread about protection - it's a thread about making money.\n\nIf I want to stay in the trade what I've found works better is:\n\n1. Be properly sized so that you don't get liquidated\n2. Layer in short puts under your underlying if it drops. This is effectively DCA'ing and lowering cost basis.\n3. If the stock price is recovering just sell more puts until you reach your adjusted cost basis. This prevents you from \"Selling the hole\" and closing the trade for an inevitable loss if you try to lower cost basis through covered calls.\n4. When you have sufficient gains (above adjusted cost basis); only then sell covered calls.\n5. Stop selling puts in this case because you're just exposing yourself to violating step #1 above. Selling puts is like adding to the trade, and in this case step #1 is \"be properly sized so you don't get liquidated.\"\n\nIf you're hanging out there sitting on all your buying power in credit put spreads on something like AAPL at a strike like $170 because you were following steps 3 through 4 and didn't let the puts expire and close out that side...\n\nDon't cry to me when the stock falls significantly in the money and you have no buying power to manage the trades for a profit.\n\nStep 1.\n\nBE PROPERLY SIZED.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nAnyway.\n\nI don't care you think I'm cocky. This is the best damn strategy anyone will probably ever tell you. I'm giving it to you for free.\n\nThere's some mathematical reasons this is what works and collars, protective puts, iron condors, butterflies, your moms sock drawer and jade lizards and all that other stuff out there inevitably doesn't, I just don't know anymore how to teach this stuff. I've tried.\n\nOh and to you Theta Gang gurus. Don't ever Wheel, it just ends up boxing you in to a pinned-price that is usually your break even and you might as well just have held shares. Don't believe me? Get back to me when you retire.\n\nIt comes down to the results:\n\n* It's scalable\n* It's compoundable\n* Almost nothing else is\n\nThree rules to live and die by.\n\nRule #1. If it's not a buy it's a sell and if it's good enough to sell it's good enough to short.\n\nNo I don't care if you think that's a stupid rule (as some do). It's from one of the greatest traders to ever live, who made the equivalent of $1billion in today's money trading, lost it all, and made it all back. So until you do that you don't really get to come up with your own rules now do you?\n\nThe next rule is by another legend.\n\nRule #2. You don't know how big, small, really is.\n\nBE PROPERLY SIZED.\n\nRule #3. Never lose your position.\n\nIf you aren't able to lower your cost basis then you're not making money. If you can't scale or compound it, you aren't making money.\n\nWhat I described above works...I guess I can write another 10 pages on why it works. But it just works. You lower cost basis. You survive draw downs. You can scale, you can compound.\n\nYOU MAKE MONEY.\n\nIt's simple....making money is easy. If it's hard, you're doing it wrong.",

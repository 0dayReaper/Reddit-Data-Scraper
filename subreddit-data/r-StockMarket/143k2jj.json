But if it does I guess just don't care and HODL.\n\nFunny story from the 1970s, I think 1973:\n\n\"August was a disaster, every day was down. How could it get worse than that? Then September came, and every day in September closed below the previous day. My God.\"",

Most of the people who are laughing their way to the bank bought early or are taking a wild risk. You could get rich, or completely wiped out in this market, it's not for beginners. Just read as much as you can, invest conservatively until you understand the risks and potential upside of your plays. That's my opinion, lots will tell you I'm wrong and they may be right about that... nobody knows.",

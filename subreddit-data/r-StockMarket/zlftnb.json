Guess he's smart enough to get himself into trouble, too dumb to get himself out of it. Or maybe he's just a narcissist. \n\n\nWhatever it is, at least he'll face judgement for his crimes.",

The difference is SBF pretty much thought the Bahamas would be a safe haven plus donating to polticans would keep safe from the feds prosecuting him.  What the truth is guys having been running online crypto casinos, sportsbooks gambling operations for years and still being shutdown by the feds. \n\n I don't even think al Capone or other mob guys gave this much money to polticans. Of course they didn't have to.",

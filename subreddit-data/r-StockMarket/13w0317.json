    "postText": "Nvidia graphics cards are at the heart of the hardware that runs AI technology such as ChatGPT and with this increased interest in AI their stocks have shot right up.\n\nRecently I have been seeing some amazing things done with Photoshops new AI features in the beta and with this new obsession with AI I was wondering if anyone thought about jumping in on Adobe stocks because this feature is gonna be widely used in photo editing around the world to be sure and as it gets better even in movie editing. Adobe products are essential in many major businesses already and because of a recent downtrend it could possibly be a good time to invest now before people catch on.",

It\u2019s the company that makes a produce an end user uses, is the company that takes the big share of the profit. Nvidia will do well but the companies that build on top of there gpu will be the big winners.",

Specifically with the new AI generative fill is quite impressive. If they can build this type of functionality into Adobe Premiere it could cause a home SFX boom. \n\nPurely speculative but possible because I see this new generation of AI as a similar point in time with when the Internet was first on the scene. We had some concepts of what it could be but I think we were way off from what it actually became.",

A lot of the big tech companies are building their own AI chips. There will probably be a big market for Nvidia in the small cap / private sector, I'm just not very optimistic that in the long run it will be big tech clouds.\n\nAI tech is moving very fast right now. The next 6 weeks could change what we think right now about it. Maybe someone finds a way to train models super efficiently. Would be great for humanity, bad for some companies...",

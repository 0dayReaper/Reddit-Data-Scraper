    "postText": "I\u2019m a 23 year old business owner with around 50k in my investment portfolio. I\u2019m in the early stages of my business and will be needing access to my portfolio often for down payments and other purchases as it is most of my savings. I\u2019m really scared of the upcoming recession and don\u2019t want to loose everything I\u2019ve built over the past few years and not have access to it when I need it most for my business. Should I pull out my whole portfolio for the time being? And reinvest after the market takes its big drop to try to secure some future gains? Let me know your thoughts, thank you!",

If the market averages say 8% that means your 50kmwill double every 10 years    If you can do better in your business which you should give the additional risk, then use it there.  Else sell or close your business",

So if this $50k is needed \"often for down payments and other purposes\" it needs to be in the bank or a cash like instrument like a brokerage money market account.  The only money you should have invested should be long term money with needs that don't happen for 5 years or more and hopefully 10 years out.",

I would not recommend using more than 15-30% of the current value so you don't get into a situation of being over extended if things drop.\n\nbut if you did the stop losses, then you can adjust and move forward too.",

Of course, you could always get short term lines of credit to fund purchases and down payments without liquidating, that\u2019s another option.",

I didn't have nearly as much.  Not saying it can't be done for less but it gets harder to move the same way percentage wise.  Anyway I know he gets a ton of hate and he deserves some, but he can be right about some things and brings up the occasion good point.  I like to listen to as many views as possible personally.\n\nEdit: I also personally have no sympathy for anyone who buys stocks based on the advice of anyone on TV or the internet.  Do your own research make your own decisions and you'll be that much better than 50% of the people out there who think this is a casino.",

The quality ones will breakout even higher. I do believe HYLN to be one of the golden nuggets. I havent done enough DD on the others but I\u2019ve spent many hours on HYLN and I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve never been wrong about a high conviction investment I\u2019ve made before. Sure I\u2019ve gotten in too early and felt pain. But I\u2019ve never been wrong. That\u2019s why I\u2019m holding 1,000 HYLN strong. I also like the fact that the CEO and team at HYLN hold a large percentage of the outstanding shares. There\u2019s really not that many shares out there. I\u2019m very comfortable.",

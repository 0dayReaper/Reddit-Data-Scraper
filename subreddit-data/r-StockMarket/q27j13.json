Not the flavor. It reminds me of a time when my parents didn\u2019t age a year every time I see them and relatives weren\u2019t dropping like flies. It reminds me of a time when friends weren\u2019t devastated by decades long relationships vanishing in an instant because someone got drunk and tboned a car. It reminds me of a time before every blood test comes back with some new fucking bullshit that I don\u2019t understand but scares the shit out of me because the doctor just says \u201ctake more of this, now take less of this, hmm, guess you\u2019ll just have to live with that, NEXT.\u201d \n\nIt reminds me when my immediate happiness was the only thing I had to worry about, and that\u2019s why I sit in a gross parking lot by the dumpster once a week and shove cheap beef in my face. \n\nIt\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not even tasty, but god dammit I will fight for that fake bullshit beef flavor. \n\nI should stop drinking and go to bed.",

Colleges and Universities around the nation decided that instead of helping prepare young people for the real world they would do the opposite by raise tuition fees as high as they could without attracting too much attention and giving the students who have no jobs a soul crushing debt to carry with them. \n\nI did a quick search. For 2020 and 2021 30 percent took on loans for education with the average being around over 38k per student with at least 5.7% of that already 90 days past due.\n\nThis is not a political statement. I'm not even sure if the colleges were being greedy or not. All I do know is that an 18 year old kid has zero idea how horrible debt is and how incredibly hard it is to pay it off. Yet they're being allowed to sign for them with no job just a hope and a prayer. \n\nIf the news is stock related please don't be about my space stocks!!",

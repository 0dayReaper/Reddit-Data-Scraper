    "postText": "**Hi team.**\n\n**I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.\n\n**My current investments are the following:**\n\n* 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.)\n* My home (Paid off).\n* 2 Stocks (NIO &amp; Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share.\n* My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).\n\nI have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).\n\nMy monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).\n\nI know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.\n\nSo, I've heard the term \"mutual funds\" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms \"HYSA and Money market funds\". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).\n\nSo now, I plan to change how I manage my money.\n\n**What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**\n\n1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.\n2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.\n\n**What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**\n\n1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.\n2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account.\n3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF).\n4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.\n\nSo, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy?\n2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.\n\nP.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.\n\nI appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.",

The complex is not easier to buy and sell and you\u2019re less likely to touch it.  The etf, having the same value and risk is easier to buy and sell so you\u2019re more tempted to do so.",

MM funds are a good alternative as well but with big enough dollars the 50bps+ you get for T-bills makes a difference. Tax loss harvesting your NIO position could be a good play as well. Just wait 31 days before buying again. Finding some more high growth or high income private investments outside of just real estate could be helpful to diversify your portfolio.",

Thank you u/Braxton2727. \n\n**Regarding zero-coupon T-Bills:**  \nI have no idea what that is; I'll research it now. Thank you, Braxton. (I tried doing a quick research about this before submitting this comment, but I guess it's not as simple as I thought, so i'll check on this.).   \n\n\n\\------------  \n**Regarding T-Bills with a positive coupon % and a maturity date:**  \nI do understand what a T-Bill with a positive coupon and a maturity date is (**I GUESS**). \n\n**For example**, I just logged into my Fidelity account and found multiple options. Here's one:\n\n  \n**\"UNITED STATES TREAS BDS 6.25000% 08/15/2023 6.250 08/15/2023\".**\n\nThis one means that the APY for a year is 6.25%, right? If I hold it from June 2023 to August 2023, I won't get 6.25% as this is for a year, but what I'll earn from the investment is 6.250(coupon)/12 (months in a year) \\* 3 (active months of holding) = My earnings % from locking that t-bill with that coupon and holding it until 08/15/2023, correct?\n\n  \nSo, I'll be getting 1.56% of my total investment if I get that T-Bill for the remaining 3 months of maturity, right?\n\n  \nIf I'm wrong with what I said, **I'd really appreciate your correction,** as I'm trying to learn.  \n\\------------  \n**Regarding MM Funds:**  \nMM funds were easy for me to understand. Starting Tuesday, I'll be transferring everything I have and everything I collect every month to an MMF, instead of having it in my Wells Fargo account. Once I get familiar with T-Bills, I'll start purchasing some with a portion of my MM Funds.  \n\\------------  \n**Tax loss harvesting:**  \nI've read about it, and I plan to realize my losses for this next 2023. But why do I need to wait 31 days before purchasing it again?  \n\\------------  \n**Finding more high-growth or high-income private investments besides real estate:**  \nAny ideas?",

When I mentioned in one of those comments that \"I'd never be able to buy a house with NIO,\" I meant to say \"home.\" *I don't like to brag on Reddit (I actually* ***hate people that brags about money***\\*), but\\* ***I've sent you proof***\\*, including the current value of my Wells Fargo checking account as your comment might discourage others from helping.\\*\n\nAt 26, I started purchasing rental properties but didn't own the place where I lived in. I was renting a one-bedroom apartment for $1,300 in Miami, FL (it made financial sense as it was extremely cheap). In June 2022, my landlord increased my rent from $1,300 to $1,800, which prompted me to take the savings from my checking account and purchase a modest condo for $180,000 in cash. That's where I started living. My original idea when considering buying my own home back then wasn't to get a modest condo for me to live in, but rather to acquire a really nice home, worth a lot more than $180,000. But because i hated the idea of paying that amount in rent, i bought a \"decent/fine\" place to live in and stop paying rent. I've always lived a frugal lifestyle. As mentioned in the post, i still drive a car that doesn't even have the A/C working so i mostly use my girlfriend's car. lol. In my favor, i don't really drive much, maybe once a week for groceries, but that's it.",

            "comment": "For newcommers in stock market investments, the common recommendations is to start with a ETF - one large enough (Vanguard)  - check on your broker account if there is a core list with zero fees (I found it for me and I buy monthly with 25% of income on same ETF again and again).  One with dividend distribution is great, as you can reinvest the dividends now or to access the dividends. This is lower risk than picking stocks.\n\nI would study the idea to buy with mortgages. I know the interests are big now but are still smaller than inflation, and think there is the possibility to refinance once the interests are going down (I did this during the covid and I have a such a small interest). The idea is the rent to cover the mortgage and if you have any extra savings and no other idea what to do with money, pay faster the mortgage.  I have a few properties (smaller than you, far away smaller than you, my income is like 10% from Rentals but one day loans will finish one after the other ...) and my only regret is to not start using this tool earlier. You already have 100k in savings, you can use a part for a pay down and closing costs for a new home and add a mortgage now.  In the next year you can save another 100k and do it again etc.\n\nI know you are focused in rentals as you are good on it, but I would not totally dismiss the idea to invest in 401K + ROTH as are taxed deductible money - but postpone it. Until then read or maybe speak with a tax advisor, there are some tricks to access this money earlier without fees, learn how to  rollover from a 401(k) plan to Roth Ira, how much money from Roth you can access, how much taxes you will pay on the dividends, but definitely you have to split your saving monthly money into your a big Emergency Fund (as you have 4 big properties and things can go broken /vacancy / renovations between tenants) , the brokerage account, money for a new real estate and the pension plans.\n\nIn the meantime, read some books on how to pick a Company that match your vision: how to interpret the graphics of the stock price, to look at their vision and investments, understand the P/E, volatility, read their financial periodically reports, how much loans they have, exposure, their competitors etc etc -  and definitely build a  strategy, asset allocations, diversification of the portfolio in different industries, how much of portfolio to put in one stock, how much of portfolio to put in one industry, how much of portfolio to put in a country etc etc.  This takes time so I finally add to my portfolio   a new stock each 2-3 months.",

I split my monthly income to: 30% mortgage, 25% savings, and the left over food /child / holidays/bills etc. The extra bonus are 100% saved - normally with these I buy stocks or use for paydown for a new real estates.\n2. VUSA is paying dividends (I prefer VOO as is accumulation - I am lazy).  Edit to add VWRL , too. There is a site, justetf. com where you can filter the ETFs by the owner, distributing or accumulation, TER, size, markets exposure etc",

Extra protection and Tax benifits.\n\nBut like I said see a Financial Advisor, thats what they're there for, you have the money, do what the rich do, build people around you, stop trying to do everything yourself.\n\nJust sayin \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I plan on trying that, but it would likely mean investing 95% of everything I make back into the business. So for now, what I'm trying to do is to build a strong enough safety net before investing heavily in business growth.\n\n&gt;And hope you have these properties under a business which is part of a trust?\n\nNot a trust, but a regular LLC. I should have done it through a trust.\n\n&gt;But like I said see a Financial Advisor\n\nI've probably consulted with 2-3 financial advisors, but they never really recommended much. I've learned more on my own than from their suggestions. It's not easy to find a good financial advisor. If I had a reliable one, I wouldn't have posted this on Reddit, haha.",

Ask for the pros and cons of these options and what they advise, thats what a good advisor should do.\n\nOr ask friends or make friends that have your kind of income and assets who they use. The more you earn the better advice you can get, money talks. These kind of advisors want be adverising they have their target market of that higher percentile. You can't just go to the guy around the corner near the Chicken shop Lol.\n\nGood luck.",

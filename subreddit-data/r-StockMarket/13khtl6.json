Many politicians didn't want to fund any imperialistic ambition. \n\nSeems like a completely different country.",

The threat of violent reaction by a population means something. Whether you deny that or not doesn't change that reality.\n\nAlso, the death rate and murder rate means nothing in the discussion of 2A. 2A is about our rights. Murder rate is about our culture.",

Russians love shooting guns perhaps even more than Americans.  Did Russia's widespread gun ownership prevent Putin's dictatorship?\n\nDid gun ownership prevent Trump supporters from storming the Capitol and overthrowing the government?\n\nIf an American president happened to refuse to relinquish power, incited his supporters to rise up, convinced every single American general to side with him, and then take control, do you believe that American citizens with guns can do anything to stop this?  The US Army has helicopters, tanks, and sophisticated military equipment.  Do you think guns would stop their takeover?\n\nPalestinians have no problem procuring guns.  Even Palestinian teenagers carry guns.  Has this prevented Israel from completely subjugating them?\n\n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, the death and murder rate is relevant to a discussion of the 2nd Amendment.  If a right significantly increases the death and murder rate, then we need to think about changing it.\n\nMurder is not about culture.  It's about poor critical thinking.  Humans are dumb and emotional.  Actually, about 30% of the population is astoundingly stupid.  They make poor, impulsive decisions.  For example, a penniless person with limited options will use a gun to steal, not thinking things through.  Or, a [road-rage driver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saQ72NZtrS0&amp;t=1s) will shoot at another car for merely cutting him off.  Or, consider the [shootings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GylQTGBH4E) in the last month that simply dealt with innocent people just going up to a person's door or accidentally driving up to the wrong house to ask for directions.\n\nNo background check can screen out for stupidity or impulsiveness.  [Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaWtmSGJ5vE) at this cop who shot and almost killed an innocent teenager.  The cop did this even despite his rigorous training.  You can't cure stupidity.\n\n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou give our Founding Fathers too much credit.  They may have graduated from top colleges but their classes probably had the same rigor as today's high school.  More importantly, do you believe that our Founding Fathers were infallible?  They could anticipate all the needs of modern society?  Or, do you believe that our best and brightest haven't learned anything in the past 250 years?\n\nSome Americans' blind devotion to the Constitution is no different than their blind devotion to the Bible.  It isn't based on reason.",

I remember when people were freaking out as the total debt reached 7 trillion a long time ago, but there were no consequences because there are never consequences when it\u2019s the govt themselves making up the limits it can go to. If you told someone back then that by 2023 the US debt will be over 31 trillion then it would be unbelievable, yet here we are. In 20 years we\u2019ll be pushing 100 trillion and it won\u2019t even matter",

Russia has been doing the same thing. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal with China to trade oil in yuans, while India has been buying russian oil in rubles and rupees for months. Those countries have very little need for USD anymore. Most countries in South America have been trying to escape the USD's hegemony for 30 years, and now that El Salvador has succeeded, many others will soon take action. Argentina is talking of adopting Bitcoin just like they did. Brazil is building a partnership with Russia, China, South Africa and India to use the chinese yuan as international settlement currency (the BRICS system). Most of Africa is also fed up with the dollar, with many of the countries over there turning to China for international trade, while their populations are adopting Bitcoin at the fastest pace on the planet. The United States will default on their international debt eventually, because hyperinflation will destroy the value of the dollar. No one wants to be there when it happens and all the smart kids are escaping the boat before it sinks.",

The US dollar is involved in approximately 90% of international FX transactions. China is at like 3 percent.\n\nExplain to me how a bunch of 2nd and 3rd tier countries are going to come together to overthrow the US dollar. China and India are not even political allies. \nSaudi Arabia?? They only have regional power because the US gives them weapons.\n\nWhat are these BRIC countries going to back their  currencies against. The faith of their Governments? Highly doubt that. China would first have to open up their banking sector to the world. That ain\u2019t gonna happen anytime soon.\n\nThe US dollar is stronger than ever and will only continue to strengthen. Especially now that China has no allies that are economic powerhouses. \n\nStop being such reactionary on topics you have no business discussing. I suggest you read a book first instead of listening to the fear mongering from cable news.",

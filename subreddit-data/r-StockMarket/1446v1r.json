It's the same basic frameworks you're analyzing, it's just different customers.  If he had made it to their advisory board, his advice might very well have been \"you guys are likely dealing with securities and need to get appropriate licenses and registrations now or you're taking a huge regulatory risk.\"  Once you pick one of those, are you never again allowed to change to any other job?  Sure, maybe something shady went on; I'm not saying that's impossible.  My read of it is this filing by the companies is designed 100% to get exactly these headlines and move public sentiment, and has nothing to do with the actual legal merits of the case.",

That isn't the same as speaking officially and categorically as a representative of the organisation. It always strikes me as incredibly weird that these things are presented in the style of some informal chat.\n\nRegardless though, in the statement, he says that some cryptos are securities and some aren't, and heavily implies that the ones that aren't are larger caps. However it's notable that even in a prepared statement like this, there is zero exploration of what criteria might be used to assess this quality. There are zero examples because he doesn't want to be liable for speaking to any one crypto, just like he wouldn't in congress.\n\nHe mentions the Howey test, but he doesn't for one moment explore how decentralised an endeavour has to be, to be considered \"not a security\". Do the devs have to be anonymous? Does there have to be multiple client teams? Does the token distribution have to be sufficiently spread out? Does it depend on the consensus mechanism used?\n\nI think this debate tends to get bogged down in semantics so let's strip it back to the SECs purpose for existing - investor protection. I don't think they're trying to achieve this goal in good faith. I think they're trying to take square peg (crypto) and fit into a round hole (existing equities law), and they're making zero effort to understand how it might be different or describe to others how to quantify those differences (which would be the really valuable thing).\n\nThe public lose the most money when they don't understand what they're investing and get caught up in hype. Only the con-men themselves want that. The SEC is not doing a good job of helping steer the public away from fraudulent investments because they've tarred the whole industry with the same brush. They're not doing their job and that's why no significant project is interacting with them.",

If complying with the SEC guarantees their future operation, then yes they probably want to comply, depending on just how much compliance would affect their bottom line.\n\nAs many people have pointed out, Coinbase are one of the more conservative exchanges out there. If they were going to engage in all the activities you allege, I highly doubt they'd have IPOed at all, and invited all that extra scrutiny and control from the US.",

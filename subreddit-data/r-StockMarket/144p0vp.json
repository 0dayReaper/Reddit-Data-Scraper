    "postText": "Sauber Motorsport Group investment\n\nHow do I invest in Sauber Motorsport Group? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just dumb but I can\u2019t find any way to invest in them. Is it just not possible to invest in them from the US? Is it possible to use Charles Schwab for this? I\u2019m a big motorsports fan so I like to try and invest in motorsports related companies. With Audi joining Sauber in Formula 1 I expect good things to happen with the company. I am new to investing so I don\u2019t know a whole lot so I could very well be missing something that\u2019s blatantly obvious to most people.",

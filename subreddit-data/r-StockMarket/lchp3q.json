It has the real potential to absolutely diversify, have new channels to market and skyrocket. \n\nPrime example is Aston Martin (listed on the UK index). It got shorted to shitsville, bought out by a billionaire, and NOW LOOK AT THE PRICE! \n\nGME is much the same.... Watch and wait. I've been buying more daily on the way down to today's price.

That's the full amount plus almost half.

It\u2019s like calling IBM \u201cInternational Biz\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nFor whatever reason, TSMC just isn\u2019t in the popular consciousness despite being the clear world leader in chip fabrication.\n\nThey make literally all the chips for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Google\u2019s TPU\u2019s\u2026 And their only competition for leading node is Samsung, sorta.",

Do your in-depth research of the companies, listen to some of there quarterly business calls. Look at the rate of return history. Dividends if they have it. Focus on the ones you like most and make the most sense to you. \n\nJust keep what your doing and you\u2019ll be good long term. Do your own research and never go on the words of others especially on YouTube. There are exceptions on people you can listen to but they are few and far between. The good one are boring to watch.\n\nEdit grammar",

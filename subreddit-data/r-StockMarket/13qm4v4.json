I am surprised their marketing team got the OK for this ad which I saw on my Reddit feed. It looks very desperate which is not a good thing/sign for any company whatsoever, lol.",

There\u2019s definitely more appropriate channels to push this narrative, I don\u2019t believe social media was the right approach, sometimes certain actions are more detrimental then beneficial. But I know what you mean, sometimes it is what it is, the problem is that investors and shareholders would see this issue right away which would make them more pessimistic more then ever. This was not a good move in my opinion. I was surprised to have seen it on my Reddit feed lol",

Inflation and the consequent rising rates impact a lot of people so those with reach use what they can to try and lower consumption so the rates can go back down.  Corporate profits aren't getting nearly the headlines as public consumption because that's not the narrative that corporations want spread around.  Jpow wants the consumption to shrink so they can go back to lower rates which would theoretically boost the financial markets again and the general public is more susceptible to these narratives so that's where the effort is spent.",

Statistically speaking, if unemployment goes up one percent, ten billion dollars of credit card debt will be at risk.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the fucking credit card debt.\n\nWhy does everybody ignore that we are more indebted than at any other point in history, and it\u2019s because of the pervasive hubris about our economy? \n\nAnybody who has joined the workforce after 2011 has never experienced an actual job shortage, and so they\u2019re happy as a pig in shit to have $1000 in the bank and $5000 of monthly payments without any regard to interest accrual.\n\nMaybe, just MAYBE, the recession was written in stone back in early 2021 when the Fed put their collective thumbs up their asses and did nothing, and now we are just arguing over the minutia of how we will get there.\n\nWe are in the \u201cdenial\u201d stage, aka the \u201cnew normal\u201d stage in the market cycle.",

Not only that, but some level of economic struggle is completely acceptable. 50% of people living pay check to paycheck is acceptable. To say the working class has been exuberant at any point in the last 40 years would be wildly inaccurate. The working class has not seen an increase in quality or fulfillment in life in at least 40 years. And those at the bottom have lost quality of life. This compound interest, wealth breeds wealth, wage slavery, winner take all system we have is the problem. We need to nationalize about half the economy to create economic stability. We have boom busts because our economy is unregulated and for profit companies don\u2019t give a shit about anything other than satisfying shareholders. Google just had record profits and then laid off thousands of people. I\u2019m sorry,  this monopoly game system we have is the problem. Compound interest is the real problem. We shouldn\u2019t be charging interest. The two primary factors that lead to inflation are interest rates and greed. This system is dystopian. We\u2019ve decided some people are better and more valuable than others to such an extent that we believe some should be living and dying on the streets. Children should be without fathers, living in hostile environments that do not allow growth. You\u2019re missing the forest for the trees.",

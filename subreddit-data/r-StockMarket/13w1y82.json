    "postText": "*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and I am a \ud83e\udd2a. Do your own DD*\n\nDid you know that Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI and Michael Klein, the sponsor who brought LCID public have a SPAC? That SPAC is ALCC. \n\nALCC has an initial deadline of 7/8, though that could easily be extended to Oct with an LOI where they may not disclose who the merging partner would be (if any). Given how awful the SPAC market has been the past couple of years, it is also possible they don\u2019t make a deal and close up shop, or that an LOI is done but a deal falls through between now and Oct.\n\nSince this is a Pre-DA SPAC, the NAV is estimated to be around $10.20. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $10.70 that would mean there is a few % of some downside risk, but this could be one of the best risk/reward in the market right now while the NAV floor is in place.\n\nJudging by my interpretation of their Q1 10Q (do your own DD I am no expert) it looks like they spent $1.1 million in Q1 which leads me to believe they may be nearing a deal, which would make sense given the proximity of the deadline. \n\nGiven that Altman is the hottest CEO in tech right now and a VC himself, and that of all the SPAC sponsors Michael Klein has one of the best track records for closing deals, I personally have faith they will close a deal. And if it\u2019s anything AI with Altman\u2019s name attached I think it could moon!\n\nThis SPAC does not have warrants or options which may disappoint many of you degen gamblers, but may help them make a desirable deal with less dilution. If you are in cash and unsure of where to park it and are okay losing a few %, this may be a worthy cash park for the next few months with limited downside and a potentially explosive upside.\n\n*Note I am long ALCC and have been for months. Which probably means we\u2019re screwed*",

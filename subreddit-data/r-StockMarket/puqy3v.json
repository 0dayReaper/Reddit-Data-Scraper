It's safe to say that he's going to jail after this. They are just seeing how he handles to determine when to arrest him and how long the sentence is. Enron didn't have assets, it was a Ponzi scheme. Evergrande has enough property and land to sell to pay off its debts. They thought they were too big to fail when Chinese gov started regulated loans, debts and housing. You still don't have these regulations in America.",

I get that people don\u2019t want to lose their job but you have to draw a line somewhere and it\u2019s wayyyy before you\u2019re taking money out of a bank to give to your company.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019ve been trying to keep my eye on the AI space recently since it\u2019s been really blowing up with Chat GPT and Google Bard becoming part of so many ppls everyday lives. Including mine. People like Elon Musk recently have been talking about how important AI is going to be in the future and how much it\u2019s going to change everything going forward. Because of this I wanted to see if I could find any cool apps or software's that utilize Chat GPT or Google Bard pretty much because I think this type of app/tech is going to be the future.\n\nThat\u2019s when I came across Bubblr Inc (now called Ethical Web AI) in a PR that was talking about their new app that is suppose to revolutionize user experience with the integration of ChatGPT. However, that PR came out in April and since then I haven\u2019t seen much from them I terms of updates on them or the app. I think the basis of their app is to get rid of all the paid ads on google and give the user direct access to sites that best match their search criteria. This is honestly what sold me on the app because there\u2019s nothing more annoying to me than clicking on the first couple links on google and finding stuff that really doesn\u2019t help me out what so ever. It seem that they released the app to beta testers back in April so hopefully I can get some news on that asap. If anyone has heard anything about their app or updates that I may have missed on them please let me know.\n\nThis is just a company that I have on my watchlist as I really like the idea of their product and what they stand for. I\u2019m really excited about testing the app out when it releases and seeing the true difference when it comes to it and just using google to search for things.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other other companies that are using Chat GPT or Google Bard in their mobile apps? Would love to check them out and see if I can learn more about them. Appreciate it everyone!",

It looks like it got p&amp;d back in February and has been dying ever since\n\n27k average volume shoots up to 109k today. You gonna tell me this isn't you and some friends trying to pull something? Weird as hell that out of all the days you could have recommended this, you chose the day volume suddenly increases 4x.",

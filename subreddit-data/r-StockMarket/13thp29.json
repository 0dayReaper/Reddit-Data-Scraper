            "comment": "u/TheyKeepBanningMeVPN is exactly right...   first step is understanding what is in each of the numbers.   Free Cash Flow, EBITDA, Cash Flow from Operations are ALL non-GAAP measures.    What does that mean?  It means that, though labeled identically, almost every company calculates these measures differently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are going to examine the financials of any public company closely (EVERYONE should, yet few do), you need to read their 10K's (the annual reports) for full descriptions of how their businesses work.  Here is OPEN's latest: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001801169/000180116923000024/open-20221231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001801169/000180116923000024/open-20221231.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat filing clearly goes through exactly how their model works (its the section called \"Our Business Model\" on pg.6).    Their primary source of revenue (amongst others) is purchasing homes from sellers, then reselling them to buyers.   MEANING,  they (ideally) operate with a large amount of inventory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the case of OPEN, as u/TheyKeepBanningMeVPN has pointed out (available elsewhere in the 10k), \"T*he Cash flow from operations is based on the company's net income, which includes non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization.  These expenses are deducted in calculating net income but do not involve an immediate outflow of cash.*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs several other responders have posted,  the \"Cash from Investing\" gain suggests they sold assets.   Its not really PP&amp;E (It's property in definition, but not in the sense that PP&amp;E is used for companies in sectors besides real-estate) as someone suggested...   its inventory they hold as a natural course of business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOPEN buys homes every day.  They depreciate them quarterly, as well as subtract relevant holding/improvement expenses (\"Operations\").  Eventually they SELL them, creating actual cash inflow (\"Cash from Investing\").   To finance their inventories they have an additional offsetting line (\"Cash from Financing\").     The idea of having all three lines is so you can monitor how the company manages each, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's actually more complicated than that but...     hope this basic idea helps.",

            "comment": "\t1.\tNon-Cash Expenses: The cash flow from operations is based on the company\u2019s net income, which includes non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. These expenses are deducted in calculating net income but do not involve an immediate outflow of cash. Therefore, if a company has significant non-cash expenses, it can result in negative cash from operations while still generating positive free cash flow.\n\t2.\tWorking Capital Adjustments: Changes in working capital, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory levels, can impact the cash flow from operations. For example, if a company has aggressive sales growth, it may extend credit terms to customers, resulting in increased accounts receivable and a negative impact on cash flow from operations. However, if the company is still collecting the outstanding receivables and managing its inventory efficiently, it can generate positive free cash flow.\n\t3.\tTiming Differences: Cash flow from operations reflects the actual cash received and paid during a specific period. However, revenue recognition and expense payment timing can create disparities. For instance, if a company receives advance payments from customers or defers certain expenses to a later period, it can lead to negative cash from operations in the short term but positive free cash flow overall.\n\n- chatgpt aka google it next time",

Also, interest payments (shown as a reduction of CF from operations) is usually excluded from a FCF calculation as the interest payments go toward debt holders.",

The company lost money but there were non-cash charges in expenses most likely that got added back when evaluating true cash flow.   The other thing you evaluate in this section is changes in working capital assets or liabilities.   An increase in Accounts Receivable or Inventory suck cash, similar to a reduction in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses.   So, you take the cash flow produced from the income statement plus or minus the cash flow from changes in working capital assets and liabilities.",

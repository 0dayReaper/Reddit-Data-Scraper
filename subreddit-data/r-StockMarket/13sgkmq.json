I\u2019m looking for long term and maybe do some short term once I have funds to play with on the side. Is there a better app, should I look into mutual funds? Any advice would help . Currently have it setup to invest $25 every Monday on VOO and SCHD",

I would avoid those. \n\nVOO is good, but you may want to diversify into smaller cap stocks or overseas. If you want to do solely ETFs; $IWM, $IJR (both small cap); $IEFA, $EFA (developed international); and $EEM, $VWO (developing international) may want to be some others you might want to look into as a hedge.",

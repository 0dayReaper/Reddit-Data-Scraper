On my flight back to NJ 5 days later, my flight was only at 1/5 capacity; I had a whole row of 6 seats to myself.  This route is the only non-stop from NJ to John Wayne (SNA) in CA; I have never seen it NOT at capacity in the 6 years I've flown this route.  Travel is going to grind to a halt. Hotels are going to be vacant. Restaurants are going to be closed. Retail stores are going to see decreased foot traffic. Uber and Lyft volume are down. My daughter's school just announced a two week closure. Parents are going to have to call out of work and use their PTO. The point: people are going to lose jobs and lose income and this is going to dry up consumer spending.  \n\nEconomic activity is going to contract, but the worst part is that we have a slim social safety net for tens of millions of Americans and that net is about to be stretched to its limits. People are going to lose their income. People are going to lose their cars. People are going to lose their homes. My wife works in a school and she is telling me how heartbreaking it was discussing how they are going to feed the kids that are on free and reduced lunch programs. Yes, they are planning on how to feed these kids for the next two weeks as we go into a shutdown.\n\nDenmark and other EU countries are announcing aid packages for their workers knowing that the slowed economic activity is going to absolutely push many low and even middle income people to the limits.  The US has no plan to help average Americans; not healthcare wise, not economically, not anything.  Average Americans are basically being told \"Sorry, you're on your own.\"\n\nYou may feel OK with a nice rainy day fund and a few thousand dollars -- maybe tens or hundreds of thousands in savings -- but a big, big chunk of your fellow Americans are about to be fucked.\n\nWouldn't you think Netflix should be up? Everyone's going to be at home! NO! NFLX is the first non-essential people are going to cut once they start running out of money. As money dries up, every non-essential is going to get cut to the core. That's why the entire market is contracting: everyone is anticipating that consumer spending and economic activity is going to completely and utterly dry up in the next few months. In my 38 year lifetime, I've never seen any situation like this. There has never been a situation where large portions of the American population working hourly jobs are going to be out of work for potentially weeks if not months.\n\nThe economic fallout of this event is going to be absolutely crippling. If you are optimistic, you are dead ass wrong. If we were handling this like Taiwan or South Korea, I would be somewhat optimistic that we could contain this and get back to a normal pace by Q3. Hint: we are not handling this like Taiwan or South Korea. In 1-2 weeks, we will probably be tracking the same curve as Italy.",

Actually, the original post was a reply to a poster who was \"optimistic\" after the last breaker tripped (just some context).\n\nThe US is \"only\" a few days in at this point.  So I expect the worst of the economic impact to be in the coming weeks as more economic activity shuts down.  At some point, businesses are going to go under.  \n\nI am anticipating that airlines and probably some automakers are going to need bailouts.  Who's going to be car shopping when everything is under lockdown?  \n\nThen layoffs are going to start *en masse* and there is no plan right now to save the Average American; the whole idea of bailing out the Average American is antithetical to the Republican approach to economic policy making.  Will they swallow their pride?  Don't see any evidence of it given how Devin Nunes is still telling people it's safe and fine to go out.",

There is absolutely no need for middlemen to manage healthcare payments; it's a pool of money paid by policy holders and then distributed on an as-needed basis for the benefit of the policy holders.  That pretty much sounds like taxes to me; might as well fold it into our tax system and call it Medicare for All.\n* We'll potentially see some long term carbon emissions decrease out of this as more companies realized \"Hey, wait, we *can* go remote for a large number of our employees\"; this is long overdue.  The event is forcing many companies to finally develop policies and procedures for remote work.\n* Hopefully, the FCC wakes the fuck up and sees that affordable, fast Internet access is a basic utility.  My kids are doing online courses, but what about kids who don't have access to high speed Internet?  Everyone should have access to cheap, high speed Internet in this age.\n\nVery doubtful on other types of policy changes that we need because there is just too much ignorance in general.",

Which means no matter how much liquidity the Fed pumps in, or how low the Federal Funds Rate is: businesses will freeze hiring and expansion, further driving down employment, which will further decimate spending which is, basically, the **only** thing driving the US economy.

Many will try, a few will make lucky guesses, and most will get it wrong and come out worse than if they had taken a less risky approach.\n\nI have a certain amount of cash I decided to invest when the market started to go south. I invested 25% of that on March 11 when the market was \\~20% down from its high, and then I invested 30% on March 17 when the market was \\~30% down, and I'm still holding on to nearly half of what I want to invest in case it goes lower. I would probably put the last 45% in if the market got to around 40% down from its high. And if it continued to go lower after that, I might even decide to invest more. And all of this is money I plan to keep invested for at least 10 years anyways.\n\nThis approach isn't going to beat the few that get lucky, time the market perfectly, and go all in at the exact bottom, but I think it will beat most people who are attempting to do that. Some will / have already gone all in because they thought it couldn't possibly keep going down, and many others will be 100% sure it's going to get worse all the way up until they realize the market has mostly recovered and they were too late.",

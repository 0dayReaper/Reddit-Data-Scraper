    "postText": "I am a newb investor. I\u2019ve bought several stocks and have done fairly well. Mainly because of this group and some of the people in it. \n\nHowever I have one stock that has plummeted 60%. I purchased approximately $2000 of shares and it\u2019s down to the $800 range. It feels shitty but I\u2019m trying to dig myself out of this hole. \n\nSo my question to the group is if I have a gain one day of $80. Should I take it that day? Or should I hold on to all the shares for the long run? Or should i just get out now? It shouldn\u2019t effect my average price per share. \n\nI would certainly appreciate some productive and informative feedback on the topic. I am still learning.",

Their stock has gone up a lot in the last year and I think it has great potential to continue.  They had a great first quarter report this year.  This is my opinion because even though we are opening up schools and business more, I still think parents are going to buy their kids sports equipment so they can play at home.  I think especially for young children parents won't spend a lot of money on expensive league play (that might have cancellations when a child on the team gets Covid) or going to the indoor play yards (like Peter Piper Pizza, DB's, jump parks).  I think they will buy basketball nets and trampolines and pools, etc. for their own backyard.  Even if they bought somethings last year, they need new shoes and the next size soccer ball this year.  Dick's Sporting goods also did well last year, but BGFV is a lower priced stock.  BGFV is a budget friendly sporting goods store.  Not saying this because it is going to sky rocket this week.  I'm just saying I think through the rest of this year maybe it will go up because it has great potential to grow it's sales so much.  It's on a dip so that's why I'm buying this week.",

An investor can also stick with a share of a great company for a long time to allow gains to accumulate, rather than trading on shorter bets.\n\nI'm a diversified buy and hold investor(e.g. I sell minimally) and have had a ~15-16% annualized yield over last 10 years, doing very little, except finding good companies, and selling on rare mistakes and companies which are fundamentally changed from what I liked.\n\nTaking no action can sometimes involve much more patience, but it is an alternative for folks who haven't had a great experience with active trading. Either way, I'd suggest reviewing performance of a strategy on an annualized basis against a relevant benchmarj e.g. major index funds.\n\nThe market has been on a bender, so just about any strategy can make money at the moment, but this too shall pass.",

Anything less doesn't make me particularly proud. I've been fortunate enough to beat the index over several years. At present, I believe the way to do it is through what I call the small and midcap market consolidation hypothesis. I honestly believe small to midcap American and Canadian companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Enthusiast Gaming (EGLX), AcuityAds (ATY), Flexible Solutions (FSI), Kelso (KIQ), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, Liquid Media (YVR), PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly over the next few years.",

He\u2019s the same guy who, along with another friend, advised me to buy Apple when it was at $14 (I finally bought in at $19, and he gave me grief for buying only 10 shares; I still kick myself for not putting my entire savings in, but those 10 shares did become nearly 500 after a series of splits and sales; not bad for my FIRST investment, eh?). I think selling at 2% gain is nuts, but because he was so right about Apple, I keep wondering...\n\nI highly suspect he\u2019s a millionaire, if not in cash, almost certainly in assets, so his 2% probably goes a longer way than my 10%. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think I should use 2% as my objective. I am starting to eyeball my 10+% non-dividend holdings, since it was recommended I trim my list (I thought diversifying was good; apparently I am too diversified).",

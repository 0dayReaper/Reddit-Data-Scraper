Use the buy and hold strategy and just hold it, were coming out of a downturn so you should have some return. Forget some random stocks like you used to be into. Just stick to apple if your new and dont know what your doing",

Your theme is growth, value, dividends etc. your spine is what holds your \u201cbook\u201d or portfolio together. Blue chips are this. Apple, msft, google, amazon, united health, chevron, mcdonalds and on and on. You need safe stocks in different sectors first then when you wanna get cute and sprinkle in some growth or longshot go ahead. Truth be told you need money to invest and consistent money so you can dollar cost adjust when your blue chips go down and dive in when the market tanks.",

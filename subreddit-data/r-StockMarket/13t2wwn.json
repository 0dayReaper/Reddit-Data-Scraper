My whole thought rationale is that the tech names have already ran up, and the depressed stocks are due for a rebalancing however, it just seems like they just keep knocking them down, for I\u2019ve decided to put the majority of my money into an index fun obviously I\u2019m not gonna sell out of any of these losing positions just because I\u2019m down so much",

Also, if you think the fundamental of the company has changed, sell them out at a loss, rather than sinking together with it. I can\u2019t give any advice on the stocks that you mentioned as I am not familiar with them. As travel business is booming, I hope the airline would recover? Also, the ford, I dun know if they are making some competitive EV and selling well? AMC is not my thing, it\u2019s just a meme stock. Otherwise, you should monitor stocks like TSMC. Consider buying tsmc if it goes below 90. I am also checking AMD, if it goes below 100, I will load them up. Hope you recover fellow redditor.",

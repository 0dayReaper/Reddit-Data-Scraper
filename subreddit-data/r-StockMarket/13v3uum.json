People will try and blame everybody and everything else for it as well except the party that controls fiscal policy.  The reality is that politicians are the ones most directly responsible for stagflation and inflation. I\u2019ll stand by for the shills now that want to defend congressmen when congress has about a 19% approval rating.",

Basically they overstay their welcome, have to do basically nothing to keep their job so long as their name is next to an r or d and live in the right district or state, but only represent a slim majority of actual constituents, so it's really no wonder they have a very low approval rating.\n\nPlus both right and left wing media spends 24/7 making sure every insignificant move the other side makes is dramatized and vilified.  This reality is so predictable.",

If you read the 3 financial documents like income statement, balance sheet, you will see these companies are struggling trying to turn profits still despite being massive companies you and I OP have likely both heard of and or use regularly. I definitely would look into r/valueinvesting and learn more about reading and understand the 3 financial documents. Companies like google and meta much more profitable. Amazon has massive cash flow but over 60b in capital expenditures last year so they\u2019re not as profitable but it\u2019s ok to me cuz they\u2019re avoiding taxes reinvesting into the business. Their reinvestment is how stuff like AWS was created. Also you\u2019re doing a decent job of buy low so keep doing that",

However, I think that private labels will gain more market share and Amazon will continue to grow.\n\nThose two factors are something to keep in mind. Do I think PG will fail? Nah. But it can suffer.\n\nDollar general I\u2019m not familiar with, which is why I\u2019m inclined to slash. A similar retailer that may be a good bet is Kroger. They have a growing private label, great stores, happy employees and continue to expand.\n\nHaving Amazon covers many bases of PG and DOL. Adding something like Kroger provides some exposure to food retailing which should do well.",

It's called paying the tuition.\n\nYour homework is to not think you're a trading god and to avoid blowing yourself up when the next drop comes.\n\nIf everyone had money during dips to buy the dip then there'd be no dips. Chances are you too won't have any money to buy anything when the next dip comes. Eventually you'll find your gains wither over time. You just happened to get started near the bottom of a big rally. You could have bought dog shjt and made money.\n\nI think most your picks are crap. META, AAPL, SNAP are all garbage.\n\nI think AAPL and MSFT will be the biggest disappointment for the next 20 years. They are gigantic P/E bubbles with no where to grow.\n\nAmzn might be an exception because it will benefit from automation. Etc.",

This isn't 2011 when only 10% of the world had smart phones. Now 90% of that market is saturated.\n\nAPPL isn't MCD. It isn't even PM or BTI. It's definitely not XOM or UNP.\n\nAPPL has returned only a fraction of its earnings to shareholders, same with MSFT. Almost \\*\\*ALL\\*\\* their earnings has gone to buying new debt.\n\nIf you want to pay 30x earnings for a walking credit card that's maxed out...be my guest.

So it's actually paid out 114% of earnings to shareholders, and new debt is only 20% of earnings.\n\nAnd Apple doesn't need to grow earnings or revenues at a high rate to continue to offer market beating returns. It just needs to continue to serve it's existing markets well and continue its excellent capital allocation policy. Revenues grew less than 10% a year over the last decade and didn't stop Cook from producing excellent returns.",

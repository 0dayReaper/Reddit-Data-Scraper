More people you have on your platform the better.\n\nHardware gives you control.\n\nHonestly Facebook should release new phone hardware and and OS to compete with apple(they've done it before but failed, better to try again to spite apple). And stop developing on apple products. Apple is nothing without the community of developers making and supporting shit on there garbage hardware.",

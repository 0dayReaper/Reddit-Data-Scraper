    "postText": "P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain. \u00a0While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is\n\n**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com\n\nMassive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)\n\nWhile senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d7d039f7948ea29b46d42ef4c395b4ef2fcf1d8\n\nA total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy\u2019s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (&lt;5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)\n\n**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&amp;P500 returns during the same period.\u00a0\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One Month\n\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One Quarter\n\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnijwbqwsay61.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f18cb38c4e61bfb6ecb62d0dfb98efaa1492c2a2\n\nAt this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95cl91nwsay61.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=276e4b6ad6f81b849c3de25339986c663ada1e3c\n\nIf you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f36fc9af7105988486b65821cbbae02fedbb987\n\nBrian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f645ae27bb275de952a4026a882cb1c1d387d8f1\n\nThese are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.\n\nBut even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c929141f7b4f11056b6c59b3a14cb2c1ab8b9b80\n\nJohn Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=acd8e04b8e2b99c5c05002b795af850b322a182d\n\nThe top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.\n\nFinally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0d453de46a9a418ea854517dee9143fe335e7f19\n\nAs expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.\n\n1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession\n2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.\n3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k \u2013 $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can\u2019t be proven from the data and is left to the reader\u2019s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.\n\nWhichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!\n\nLink to Google Sheet containing all the analysis and trades: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rg5jMYG-X4I7cidQylzCNc_UpJZGNhGrjAt7g0QkXYs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt; There are two chambers in the legislative branch: Senate and House. Not all of these people are \u201csenators\u201d as you describe. \n\nI mistakenly classified all of the trades under the broad term of Senators! This is a mixture of trades done by both houses. So please keep this in mind while reading the post. Apologies again as politics is not really my strong suit. ",

Not sure where you got the 12% number, but that would be very good. \n\nSecond, according to a quick google search, studies by both Vanguard and Russell investments show a good FA can increase returns for investors by 3-3.5%. A sizable return for average investors.\n\nThe issue here is that Senators are not average investors. They have access to teams of advisors with potential insider knowledge. It seems clear from this study that they are getting a big benefit from their position in government, but they may not be acting in any corrupt or fraudulent manner. It could be a simple fact that they are incredibly tuned into economies and markets.",

Do you mean as someone that wants to sit back and earn your living from the profit you get out of investing in the same stock as Pelosi, or do you mean from the perspective of being a citizen that has to live in this country with the rest of us and may not want to have legislators skip on doing their job and just give Microsoft whatever they want because we are all invested in that stock?\n\nBecause as a citizen, you should probably want your elected lawmakers to pass sensible legislation regardless of who is being legislated.",

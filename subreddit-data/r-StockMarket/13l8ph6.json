    "postText": "Michael Burry, a well-known contrarian investor, has made significant investments in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. ($BABA) and JD.com Inc. ($JD), despite the cautious sentiment toward Chinese stocks. Burry's contrarian approach suggests he sees a valuation gap and potential for a rebound in the Chinese market.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Burry is a contrarian investor who follows Benjamin Graham's value investing philosophy, emphasizing buying stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value. He gained fame for predicting the 2008 financial crisis by identifying unsustainable practices in the subprime mortgage market.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Burry's investment strategy focuses on buying assets at a significant discount to their intrinsic value. He seeks a wide margin of safety and believes that volatility is an undervalued quality.\n\ud83c\udfe6 Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, increased its holdings in Alibaba and JD.com during the first quarter. The firm now holds 100,000 shares of Alibaba and 250,000 shares of JD.com, making them its two largest positions.\n\ud83d\udc02 While Burry is bullish on Chinese tech giants, other hedge funds, like Bridgewater Associates, have reduced their Chinese holdings. The shifting sentiments reflect the changing dynamics in the Chinese market and concerns over economic recovery, geopolitical tensions, and disappointing growth.\n\ud83c\udf10 Burry's investments in China and banks align with his reputation for taking positions that go against prevailing market sentiment. He seeks undervalued opportunities and looks for attractive investments during times of market turmoil.\n\u23f0 The duration and outlook of Burry's investment in China remain unclear. While he may be betting on a rebound in the Chinese market, the specifics depend on future market conditions and developments.\n\ud83e\udd14 Burry's investments raise questions about his long-term outlook and whether these holdings are part of a larger strategy or a short-term trade. However, his actions demonstrate his unique investment style and ability to navigate challenging market conditions.",

In Nov when META was under $90 it was an out-of-date social media platform with a crazy CEO who will drive them down into collapse, now at $250 it\u2019s once again part of the tech future. Narratives change quickly, and they change AFTER the stock price movement. The trick is to be early, by the time the narratives change you\u2019re already left in the dust",

Like BABA, I wasn't sure why he bet on it when the company decided to add more expenses for hiring 6 CEO's for the new divisions. Whereas I doubled on JD before Burry did, it's because of the overseas merchants are providing a positive outlook on China and their exports increased which brings more revenue for JD. Check A2 milk Australia and Singapore companies (ports and Temasek). Temasek is a Singaporean state own company that doubled down on JD as well as they know the the distributions and demand side as well.",

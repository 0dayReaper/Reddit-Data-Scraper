                    "comment": "Retail investors (a.k.a the normal guys like you and me) are increasing exposure to riskier assets, in other words they are bullish. This is measured with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey, the spread in the chart represents the difference between bullish and bearish people. For example if 60% is bullish and 40% is bearish then the spread is 20%.\n\nIn the other hand,  insiders (a.k.a executives and top shareholders) with far more knowledge and information are reducing exposure to their own companies (not buying more stocks or just selling) .\n\nThe point is, insiders are bearish while retail investors are bullish. Do insiders know something we dont?",

There's a lot of \"buying the top\" energy happening.",

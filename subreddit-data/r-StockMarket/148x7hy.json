    "postText": "On June 26 Genius Brands will be added to the Russell Microcap Index and will also start trading on the N.Y.S.E. under the name Kartoon Studio with the trading symbol \"TOON\".\n\nThe shorts need more than 3,000,000 shares to cover\njust as the company is launching an extensive marketing campaign to support the recent launch of \"Shaq's Garage\" on Pluto T.V.\n\nExpecting C.E.O., Andy Heyward, to announce some major merchandising deals featuring Shaq.\n\nThe current share price under $3 substantially undervalues the company considering the various assets that it owns.\n\nIt also has potential as a buyout target at a multiple of the current share price.\n\nExpecting a continued uptrend in the share price as shorts cover and institutional invested buy as the Russell Microcap Index rebalances.",

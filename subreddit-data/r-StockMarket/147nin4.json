It simply looks like the fed doesn\u2019t know what they should do so they have been trying to postpone or even avoid any big decisions at the cost of prolonged inflation. People seem to do fine as unemployment rate remains low.",

Puts aren\u2019t in the system at the moment, people are piling into calls, and \u201ceveryone\u201d expects a pause. If the Fed hikes sooooo much liquidity is taken out of the market in a matter of days.",

Buying single companies obviously doesn\u2019t mean you know what you\u2019re doing, there\u2019s almost no barrier to entry.\n\nAnd again, the shares he already sank his money into are worth more. Stock prices fluctuate, bubbles rise and pop, companies turn things around, sometimes they get acquired. $24 in cash won\u2019t just become more than $24. The stocks may never go up, the company could fold, but the odds of his $24 rising to more than $24 are infinitely more than the odds of cash multiplying. Holding gives the better odds, no question. Also it\u2019s not the same as if he hadn\u2019t bought yet, because before he sold, the money was in those stocks, he had already absorbed the entirety of the downside of the risk, the worst that could happen now is that he loses the rest of his measly $24, so it already got as bad as it could, but those losses weren\u2019t real until he cashed out, and only then did he truly lose. There was practically nowhere to go but up, from that point. That\u2019s not mentally the same as risking \u201cnew\u201d money.",

So, if the stock he\u2019s holding now doesn\u2019t have as good a growth prospect as other stocks, then he\u2019s better off selling the $24 worth of stock and buying something else. \n\nI\u2019m not saying if he had never bought and still has $1800 to spare, I\u2019m saying if he didn\u2019t own these shares right now and has $24 to spare. \n\n$24 worth of shares and $24 cash are 1 button click away from each other. If he had this stock on his watch list and saw it fall 98% and decided this is a good entry and bought $24 worth of stock, then he is in the exact same situation he is in now. He holds $24 worth of a stock that\u2019s fallen 98%. \n\nThe question is what has the best upside. If he think the stock will recover at a rate that beats the market then yes he should hold, if not then he should sell. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to see this with bigger sums of money so let\u2019s use larger numbers but the same 98% drop. Say that OP invested $100B into ABC stock, then some time later the investment was worth $2B. Should he hold $2B worth of this stock or should he sell and move the money into a better investment. \n\nAccount size only matters on an emotional level, the financial decisions you make should be based on the maths. A 98% loss sucks, of course, but that\u2019s not a reason to weather out a 99% or 100% loss. Money held in stocks, can just as easily as cash, be moved to other stocks, so it is prudent to treat it as such.",

I did turn on the options section but I looked at the prices and I turned it off immediately so I don\u2019t know if they start your account as a margin account or if you turn on the options if it switches to a margin account. Point being I just looked it up if your account is a margin account Robinhood can lend out your shares without notice or compensation to the account holder. I have an update, my friend and I looked on his robinhood account and I am pretty damn sure when you start an account with them they make it a margin account which is dirty because they can loan your shares out and I am thinking this goes for crypto too. You may only own 20 shares of a stock well if others own that same stock they can pool from many others to get the 100 shares to loan out and make money without the owners of said stock. So everyone you have been warned with robinhood they are using shares from unsuspecting clients to make money with no compensation to the share owner.",

So many other brokerages out their with so many better features that can only better your experience playing in the stock world. So I repeat please move outta their ASAP!!",

That\u2019s ok though cause we won the lawsuit even though they still get to operate and already made it perfectly clear that it could happen again simply cause they lied blaming it on everything but their own fucked up corrupted motive to protect shitadel!! Trust me when I say this, THEY HAVE EVERY INTENT TO DO IT AGAIN!!! But to each their own, if anyone is willing to gamble on them being in your corner when the your holding a royal flush well with all respect to anyone in that situation with ROBBIN THE HOOD, you get what you deserve specially after being warned. It\u2019s  out their all the corruption their involved in so with that being said and like they also say you play with fire, YOU GONNA GET BURNED or in this case fried to a crisp!

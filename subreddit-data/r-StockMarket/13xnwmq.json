The tech companies most valuable today aren't valuable because they market cutting edge hardware, but because they figured out how to use technology as the infrastructure to deliver a valuable consumer experience. The value is not the highway, train track, or airport, it's in the stuff that passes through those. \n\nI agree that AI as a product in itself will probably have a rapid rise and fall in value, and the serious value will happen once AI becomes the technological background, as the internet did.",

The price adjusted to account for the fact that it was being vastly under-valued. But people don't see beyond ChatGPT and so they go \"okay, NVIDIA's sugar coating its projections. It'll increase but it would take some sort of paradigm shift for it to increase that much and I don't see that happening as a result of ChatGPT. I mean, yea, it's cool, but what can it really do that's of value to businesses?\"\n\nThese people are completely ignoring the actual motivator of the increase in demand for GPUs: locally-hosted open-source AIs. Google's leaked memo states that they expect to be outpaced by open-source models (which is currently happening). By the end of the year, the best LLMs on the market will be open source and capable of being run on in-house machines without using the internet. This enables companies to use them without worrying about confidentiality. These models are not simply turn key solutions but rather the starting point that you can customize via \"fine-tuning\" (amongst other things) on whatever dataset you have without sacrificing confidentiality.\n\nAnd that's just addressing the \"ChatGPT-like LLMs\". There is a vast variety of other models that are specialized to perform various tasks. They require fewer resources to run but are only good at doing a certain thing (e.g. classification, sentiment analysis, keyword generation, embeddings, etc). However, if you're running specialized models, you're probably running several of them and piping them together in order to accomplish a larger overall task. There's thousands of such models and it seems I don't go a week without hearing about yet another record-breaking model being released. *That* is what's driving this. ChatGPT and MidJourney and all of that are the tip of a very large iceberg. Most of the rest of it is [in here](https://huggingface.co/models).\n\nThe catch to all of this, though, is that in order to run these, you need a very large GPU (far beyond what a gamer would be expected to buy).\n\nAnd yet, I see basically zero users in this subreddit ever making even a reference to any of this. I see far more references to the completely irrelevant crypto/NFT stuff. It's not over-valued; people are staring at the tip of the iceberg going \"that's all? what a hype!\".",

                    "comment": "The value will increase exponentially and it won't take decades for it to hit the singularity. People who are unfamiliar with what's going on beneath the surface here are perpetually comparing this to crypto/NFT/the dot com bubble. It seems this is the hallmark of the uninformed; they know nothing about it so all they can do it make claims based on historical behaviors vaguely related to it that they *do* know about. I hadn't even considered comparing this to any of those things because it's fundamentally different than each of them. It's like basing your baseball bet on what happened this year in hockey just because \"they're both sports, right?\"\n\nWhat we're seeing here is unprecedented and NVIDIA's current price is *still* an under-reaction. The iPhone pales in comparison. The internet pales in comparison. Both in terms of magnitude and in terms of immediate, unexpected, exponential growth. We weren't expecting this level of AI to occur for another 10 years, at least. And this unexpected development is still developing... very very quickly. The end of the year is going to come around and NVIDIA will be even more valuable and everyone in here will be going \"ah... another crypto boom, huh?\" because they never understood that this isn't a response to ChatGPT and MidJourney.\n\nWe're a year or two away from automating away the dev work that I used to do (where I created a SaaS that made about $20k/month for over five years). I spent years creating that system. If I had to start all over with the tech that's been available to me for the past ~2 years? I could do it in under a year. If I had the tech we currently have? It'd take me maybe 6 months. If I had the tech that, at this rate, we'll have by the end of the year? It'd take me a month.\n\nBut it's \"all just an over-reation\" to NVIDIA's primary customer base changing from \"hardcore gamers\" to \"every company of a certain size in America that has the need for internal tools through which to understand and reason about large amounts of data\". There's *no possible way* they became 3x more valuable as a result of that, right?\n\nKeep waiting for that correction (spoiler: it's not coming)",

In the 90s, those chips were huge. Processors were marketed like cars, with TV ads touting their catchy names and performance stats. But fast forward only a few years, and none of that mattered to consumers, because processing power had outpaced what consumers actually needed, and the internet had made the idea of a self-contained computer experience obsolete. And nowadays, consumers don't think about processors. \n\nThis is where AI will go, too. It's an exciting product right now, but once it takes hold, the real value will be the consumer experiences that it enables. Whether the underlying technology is objectively the best will cease to matter.",

When the fantasy of what could have been creeps into your head, reason tends to go out the window and regret fills that void. Thinking \"what could have been...\" is, I imagine, one of the leading causes of regret, and most of those regrettable decisions seemed reasonable at the time.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, had it not been for that $800 transaction, Ron Wayne still probably would have 10% of Apple. Dilution, the desire to look in gains permanently, and many other factors would mean he probably wouldn't be worth $247B right now. But the point still remains even controlling for that.",

Having more faith in my own judgments would have made me a lot of money lol. plus with only two companies in the gpu market i didn't think AMD would go down. \nFunny thing is i did the same mistake with Nvidia just a few years later they were crushed at 160\u20ac value but half a year later the rally started and kept going until now. \nMaybe ill make the same mistakes again. my watchlistd are full of stocks i picked with some research and intent, all green, always and yet last year is the first year i actually made a return. getting nervous is the enemy of investments",

A lot of the people on the sub (tho not a majority, which I guess is pretty representative of the population as a whole) actually have pretty okay jobs like engineers or bankers. I was on that sub a decent amount a little over a year ago (was working as a coax design engineer for Comcast for reference), and eventually unsubbed after I noticed an increase in aggressiveness and negativity which wasn\u2019t helping me. Most of the crazy shit that comes out of there is like 10% of the user base, about the same as the crazies in any sub, but they are the voices that get traction because it\u2019s easy to mock lol.",

If you aren't upset, you sure seem to have a bug up your butt. \n\n&gt;I would never move back, I love it here. \n\nCool. Now imagine if whenever you live has rising housing costs and high cost of living that outpaces normal 9-5 wages. Now imagine someone whining tonyou \"just go back home where it's cheap\"\n\n\n&gt;You sound like you\u2019re in your early twenties dude.\n\nI wish \n\n&gt;It\u2019s not wild to imagine the parents of adults today are anywhere between late 50\u2019s to early 70\u2019s\n\nEither you aren't very good at math or your writing comprehension isn't very good. It's all good, as an immigrant, it's highly likely English is it your first language so I commend you",

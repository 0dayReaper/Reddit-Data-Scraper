Some will be taken off the gate and parked on vacant ramp space. Some will stay on the gate overnight. Smaller airports, the planes will mostly just sit on the gate. That's how it works under normal circumstances,\n\nParking IS a huge issue right now. You can't just abandon a plane and leave it sitting on a gate for weeks in SNA, or some other small airport. There are still some flights operating, so that gate will be needed. There's also maintenance that still has to get done whether the plane is flying or not. So you need to park the planes where they can be worked on. A hub that normally sees 15-20 planes overnight might have 80 now.\n\nTo reduce operating costs, airlines are putting planes in long term storage so the maintenance is reduced to bare minimums until they're ready to put them back into service, and parking them at remote airports. Most large US carriers are operating somewhere around 30% of the flights as the same month last year, and most of those flights are at least 75% empty. You can't park that many planes without running into problems.\n\nTL;DR - Parking is actually quite an issue right now.",

The lion\u2019s share of the cash utilized in airline stock buybacks has come from these extra fees that they introduced which are mostly pure profit for them. Think baggage fees, \u201cpremium economy\u201d, change fees, upgrades, inflight wifi surcharge, etc. Most of these fees were not around 20 years ago; they are mostly recent additions. As I said they are mostly pure profit for the airlines. Rather than keep some of this cash or use it on investing in the fleet or the staff, they\u2019ve used it on buybacks to jack up their share prices. Unfortunately this means that they always ask for bailouts, and the US government always gives it to them.  \n\n\nThe bailout protects employees until September 30, but it looks like after that, United will be heading for massive layoffs unless global travel demand goes right back up to where it was. Hint: it won\u2019t. People take time to warm back up to travel, compared to other market activity, since travel is a much larger outlay than other purchases.",

It makes sense for the government to be an emergency lender, because no one else really can do that. My only qualm is that they don't charge enough for that service. \n\nMost airlines have good business, but didn't have the liquidity to survive 3-6 months without any revenue (like most businesses). All the need is financing. The government can issue a 10 year bond at almost 0% and fund airlines for 10%. That's a gain for the taxpayer. If they don't like the terms, go bankrupt.",

Apple had to close all its retail stores and will almost certainly delay multiple major launches this year. Facebook and Google are taking huge hits to ad revenue as companies pull back. None of them has had to lay people off, let alone come hat in hand to taxpayers asking for a bailout.\n\nYou're making an argument that a company can either do buybacks, pay dividends, and invest \\_OR\\_ it can stash some cash on the side, but not both. That's not true. And before you argue that these companies are unique, I can also point out Johnson and Johnson sitting on $20bn which I think is around 2 quarters of United Airlines revenue. United spent 80% of their cash flow on buybacks.  Maybe spend 50% on buybacks and stash some away so you can stay solvent. Ironically their stock price would probably be in better shape now if they were able to say \"our balance sheet is healthy,\" but....",

Then their assets, routes, etc. are purchased by the survivors who come out stronger. Well managed companies will be rewarded with higher valuations because they have intrinsic value. Companies that are reckless will be seen as just that, and punished for it in the market. But instead, we prop them up and stop them failing. Any company trying to do the right thing will struggle in good times as the reckless companies play games to prop up their price, and get no reward in bad times since everyone gets bailed out anyway. It totally breaks the free market idea that bad companies fail and good companies succeed.",

Everyone has to be irrationally greedy because if they don't they will fall behind in good times, and since everyone gets bailed out they don't gain any advantage in bad times.\n\nNow imagine there aren't bailouts.

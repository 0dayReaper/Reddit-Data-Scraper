    "postText": "I acted on my AAPL short idea. $192.5 short strike. Break even about $192.75. Defined risk. Long strike @ $197.5\n\nExpiry JUN16\n\nI don't think AAPL will sustain a push above previous all time high. I respect it could challenge the ATH and get pretty aggressive, so I chose a credit spread as opposed to opening any kind of debit with a Stop Loss. I chose a pretty high strike at more buying power to leverage into it because I'm conservative.\n\nIf I were a betting man I'd just do a synthetic short around $184 and keep a tight stop loss on it and bet that AAPL doesn't even significantly breach the ATH.",

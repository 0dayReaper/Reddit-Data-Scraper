I'm simply here to inform.\n\n1) The q's have hit 2 standard deviations from the weekly expected move and have hit RSI levels of 70+ with all mega-cap tech stocks in the overbought territory. We also saw a strong near 2% move the other day likely because people were shorting on the 50% fib and were forced to cover (aka squeezed).\n\nExpected moves: [https://i.postimg.cc/tTnBscjn/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tTnBscjn/image.png)\n\nQQQ RSI/fibs: [https://i.postimg.cc/xCLKDVQ5/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCLKDVQ5/image.png)\n\n2) Stocks like Goog have very high rsi and have had a 3 standard deviation move last week and a 2 standard deviation move this week. We've also managed to hit two fib levels to the upside in a matter of days.\n\nExpected moves last week (3 standard deviations on goog): [https://i.postimg.cc/GtWwBDVd/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GtWwBDVd/image.png)\n\nGoog RSI/fibs: [https://i.postimg.cc/J0BSWnng/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J0BSWnng/image.png)\n\n3) Weekly MACD on DXY looks like it's starting to cross bullish. Notice how in the past, the first crossover tends to be a fakeout and the second crossover is the real move. Stocks have also had divergence from the dollar. As the dollar has been appreciating so have stocks. THe same holds true for the 10-year treasury yield. \n\nWeekly MACD DXY: [https://i.postimg.cc/T3X1F5wz/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T3X1F5wz/image.png)\n\n4) Large unfilled upside gaps on VXN (nasdaq volatility) and VIX. We're also below macro level trendline support on both\n\nVXN GAP: [https://i.postimg.cc/xCg4m4p0/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCg4m4p0/image.png)\n\nVXN  Chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/ZY21x1KR/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZY21x1KR/image.png)\n\nVIX GAP: [https://i.postimg.cc/BnqNTgDb/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BnqNTgDb/image.png)\n\nVIX Chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/sXpZ0FCr/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sXpZ0FCr/image.png)\n\n5) Low Market Breath with rising indicies: [https://i.postimg.cc/5NZbjXFs/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/5NZbjXFs/image.png)\n\n6) Stocks like aapl are in a massive rising wedge and have not necessarily seen a correction on the move\n\nAAPL Chart: [https://i.postimg.cc/mrK5y9Bn/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrK5y9Bn/image.png)\n\n7)  We're seeing conditions that favor a rotation in the markets. Megacap tech is getting overvalued whereas other parts of the market is becomming more fair value. My personal thoughts is that the gains on these stocks are being frontloaded in the first 2 quarters and likely the back half where everyone keeps saying earnings will be better will likely have a rotation. Earlier this year, they were saying the first half would be bad and of course the inverse happened.\n\nS&amp;P 500 heatmap 1 month view: [https://i.postimg.cc/bw7x69S1/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bw7x69S1/image.png)\n\nS&amp;P 500 heatmap 3 month view: [https://i.postimg.cc/154Dsjpp/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/154Dsjpp/image.png)\n\nS&amp;P 500 heatmap 6 month view: [https://i.postimg.cc/GmwtV7z3/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmwtV7z3/image.png)",

Even with VIX down the moves are still big, it's a hidden volatility or for whatever reason the VIX isn't reflecting it.\n\nDollar wrecking ball is definitely incoming. DXY looks like a megabull, cup and handle pattern is almost completed. This pattern was common in the 80s when post-inflationary recessions hit. Looks exactly the same.",

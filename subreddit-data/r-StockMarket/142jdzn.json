I made a post about its particulars.  \n\n\nI say you got ONE shot for DPST to hit $140 (the old $14).\n\nYou might get that shot sometime July/August.\n\nIf it doesn't hit it...you're going to almost certainly lose the trade. I'd stay in the trade until DPST tests $135. It'll probably test that range.",

Options can be risky, especially with a smaller amount of money. It's important to think about the risks involved and decide if it matches your financial situation and how much risk you can handle.  \nThe timing of your investment is important. It seems like you bought the options before the recent Debt ceiling concerns came up. Events like this can have a big impact on the value of options and the things they're based on.  \nOptions have their own value, regardless of what the underlying thing does. If nobody wants to buy the options at the price you paid, you might end up losing money. The value of options depends on different things, like the price of what they're based on.  \nBased on what you noticed about DPST, it looks like you bought the options before it dropped by 35%. Market changes and unexpected things can affect options trades and sometimes lead to unexpected losses.  \nRemember that there are many factors involved, and it's important to consider the risks of options trading. Things like Delta and other Greeks can affect how much options are worth and how profitable they are. Keeping a close eye on them is important for managing your positions well.",

            "comment": "Ok I looked at DPST a little more carefully because something didn't make sense.\n\nDPST made a reverse split. Your cost basis was apparently $6.60 and you bought a call for $14.\n\nThe prices are now 1/10 reverse split or $66 is your cost basis, and $140 is your call strike.\n\nDPST is a 3x ETF - there's a small possibility it reaches $140. It only has to reached $140.20 for you to break even. For $100 I'd just stay in the trade at least until DPST tests $135.\n\n  \nIf it fails $135 then it's doubtful it'll come back by Sept.\n\nYou only got one shot at this. Banks will get bad going into Sept / OCT",

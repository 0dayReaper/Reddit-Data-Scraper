If a community/ township needs money, can't raise property taxes, they just up the amount of traffic stops (commercial vehicle enforcement is lucrative and serves a feel good safety ideal) and presto. Coffers filled. But, hey, it's not a TAX. Someone is always paying is the moral of the comparison",

The only lack of understanding of basic economics would be yours and the previous replier. Kick rocks\n\n\"The Fed\u2019s lending program to help banks pay depositors is backed by $25 billion of taxpayer funds that would cover any losses on the loans. But the Fed says it\u2019s unlikely that the money will be needed because the loans will be backed by Treasury bonds and other safe securities as collateral.\"\n\neconomists say the banks\u2019 customers still stand to benefit from government support.\n\n\u201cSaying that the taxpayer won\u2019t pay anything ignores the fact that providing insurance to somebody who didn\u2019t pay for insurance is a gift,\u201d said Anil Kashyap, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of what happened.\u201d",

It has nothing to do with FDIC.\n\nOn Thursday, the Fed provided the first glimpse of the scale of the response: It said banks had borrowed about $300 billion in emergency funding in the past week, with nearly half that amount going to holding companies for the two failed banks to pay depositors. \n\nTaxpayer backed loans to failed banks. I wonder what the return will be? When will it be paid back?\n\nIf I loan you 5k because you screwed up financially and you pay me back one year later with zero interest then I am on the hook for that loss, that is likely the situation with a lot of these loans. The taxpayer funds are being used for this, not FDIC. I don't know how many times I have to reiterate this, you guys are thick.",

They said they would make sure all of SVB\u2019s depositors would have access to their funds by the next day, not just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. Also on Sunday, New York regulators shut down Signature Bank, which had gotten into crypto, and the federal government said its depositors\u2019 funds would be guaranteed as well. The Fed said it was also going to open up a facility to make funding available for other financial institutions in the form of one-year loans to try to limit contagion across the banking sector and to stave off other bank runs, like what happened with SVB. Essentially, the Fed wants to boost confidence so people don\u2019t panic and try to withdraw all their money all at once.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s lending program to help banks pay depositors is backed by $25 billion of taxpayer funds that would cover any losses on the loans.",

Obviously.\n\nReason was that a few people asked around January if the sub is getting more quiet and I provided screenshots of [Subredditstats](https://subredditstats.com/), which indeed show declining-everything (comments, posts etc you name it).\n\nMy post got removed and I asked for clarification on why. And well eventually this quote came up.\n\nIt is really up to you if you want to embrace whatever this sub evolved to in two years.\n\nI highly recommend you not to. This is financial advice.",

Seems to work and the bad actors might pay a fine that is definitely way cheaper than having to pay what they owe on paper.\n\nEven if for some reason hedgefunds and MMs alone can\u2019t stop the MOASS, then there\u2019s the government that\u2019s always ready to step in. You\u2019re literally posting about it right now. And in this case they don\u2019t even have to pump trillions in to stop it, they can just simply give SHFs a one-time pass when it comes to having to cover whatever meme stock is the catalyst, and the average American will not care because now the market and their pensions are saved from collapse.\n\nSo there\u2019s your counter DD, and it\u2019s called factoring in reality. Jesus Christ the cognitive dissonance on the average meme stock bagholder is unreal.",

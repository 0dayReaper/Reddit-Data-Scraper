Fundamentals will always trump technical analysis on the basis on investing, theres no disagreement there. But to say technicals dont work, especially for intraday trading, is simply wrong.

            "comment": "So, from a \"if this, then that\" prospective (clearly implied by the line to the right of the blue boxes in the diagram), is there a way to back test these patterns to determine their \"then that\" correlation? (I'm fine with a correlation of 0 as long as that's where the evidence takes us)\n\nIf there is an easy way to do this, my next question is:  what time frame has the highest correlation for this type of technical analysis?\n\nAnd for everyone accusing technical analysis of being \"astrology for money\", would you go to the bank if the news paper astrology said \"to day is a good day to deposit money\" for all the astrological signs?  (the point is that it might be random, but if people have been conditioned to act on the randomness, there are very real outcomes).  And, in theory, I would suspect that if you limit correlation analysis to periods of high volume, you're like to find something on either side of zero.",

There are some prices particular to every stock, relevant to other metrics, that become resistance up or down or form a range. That kind of \"soft\" data should never be used alone.\n\nIf you combine financial sheets with what the market seems to believe you can see an objective correlation.\n\nActively trading in the market can and does beat passive investing. People thinking otherwise repeat it like a mantra with the extreme being buy and hold total market index from birth to death for \"maximum gains\". If you are picking stocks and trying to buy dips and sell rallies then you need to understand what the business is capable of and why there is (buy or low) the volume for that stock. You also need to be in control of your emotions instead of letting them lead you. If you hold 30% of your portfolio in a stock after a rally and then sell half or more of that then you should not be feeling any emotions if there is more upwards movement after you get out. If you actively trade then some use of margin is necessary even if you are conservative about how much you use. \n\nYour absolute bear outlook for active investing is having 0% cash 0% debt. While a fully bullish outlook will see a healthy use of margin up to the risk tolerance of the individual who owns the money.\n\nTA is used after you have  grasp of fundamentals, on active trading, and in addition to not in spite of what the fundamentals are telling you. A good earnings report that tells you this business is going to be doing well in the macroenvironment over the next several years should never be ignored because your TA says otherwise.",

It is not fine to just tell everyone \"probably won't, and even if you do, is the time you spent actually worth it.\"\n\nYou could say that about CEO salaries, you probably won't ever have one but if you do is it worth the publicity?

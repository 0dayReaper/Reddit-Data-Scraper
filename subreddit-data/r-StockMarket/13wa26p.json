    "postText": "NVIDIA ($NVDA) is now trading at 37 times its revenue (P/S) and 202 times its earnings (P/E)! Now's the right time to remember what Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems told Bloomberg just after the dot-com collapse\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5h1nfnqf43b1.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a0eef2d03b6c7889ba6c50b2a152d16333849d9e\n\nCall it irony or foreshadowing, Sun Microsystem's campaign was \"We put the dot in dot com\". At its peak in 2000, the company was valued at $200 billion. By 2001, the stock price had dropped by 80% and Oracle bought Sun for $7B in 2010. A 96% drop from its peak valuation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q2llffuf43b1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cf074215982610ff6a69de3d07e2431c3d12bd59\n\nIf history is any guide, buying growth stocks that trade at 10x sales provides significantly lower returns than the broad market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyqg6r2vf43b1.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e4bcdaee9d91924619fcab2eb517d7936f9bd0d\n\nIf your aim is to outperform the market, you have a much better chance with value investing. Warren Buffett once showcased a group of investors who used the simple principle of buying value stocks with a significant margin of safety to beat the market for decades running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogzm2htvf43b1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=87ad061854a61670e8b8dad0c6275c211fa8f767\n\nValue Investing tends to outperform the market over long periods of time. The catch is that there would be significant time periods in which you will underperform the market (e.g. 2010-2021).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzilg5pwf43b1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=62d1340b948beea15c7a1192588a09535d2fa7a0\n\nBuffett goes on to highlight that Value Investing has nothing to do with brain power and everything to do with the right mental fortitude.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4pqxkfxf43b1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=32ca1ee3a235c84f305dfbe1d2e911ea4fc8d7e5",

They have a tonne of orders in for their product and they are way ahead of the competition in a massively growing field.\n\nIve seen big funds calulating that at future earnings in 5 years time their current P/E is 1.5. So if the P/E held they would make a lot of money on NVDA at the se prices.\n\nAdd to this NVDA is decoupled from the company ita a bet on AI at this point. Just like BTC and block chain. BTC didnt do anything that wasnt done better by something else. But it was the embodiment of investing in block chain technology.\n\nIn saying all that I am not buying NVDA at the current price.",

I think the market is still in this mindset, and either 1) there will be a rude awakening and realisation that money is no longer that cheap, and reality still matters (if Fed follows through with what they say) or 2) We're back to money printing, hype bonanza, and even more inequality",

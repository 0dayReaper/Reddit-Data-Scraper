                    "comment": "What's really crazy, and a lot of people don't realize, is that ETF's that follow the index like SPY and VOO use liquidity as part of their weighting system, meaning stocks with larger floats make up a disproportionately large allocation. This allows issuers and AP's to sell larger volumes which is critical since fees are so low on these compared to mutual funds.\n\nThis is interesting for a few reason: if a mega cap does a large buyback or insiders buy a lot of stock for example, the ETF issuers will actually have to reduce the allocation - which is arguably bad for ETF holders. It's even more apparent in the case of insider selling which forces the ETF to *increase* allocation. If insiders have a valid reason for the sell-off the last thing you want is to be the one buying their bags.\n\nBut more importantly, it increases the weighting of the *already-huge*, largest cap tickers. Basically, these ETFs are more concentrated in a few stocks than most people realize and yet, they are touted as being highly diverse and safe. It's scary to me how similar it is to housing - everyone seems to believe it's guaranteed to go up over time, and literally everyone has their money in these things. Seriously go ask any friend what their retirement fund is held in and it's going to be mostly SPY, VOO, or a target date fund that holds similar concentrations of the huge, top stocks (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, GOOG, TSLA, AMZN, etc).\n\nThat's not diversity.",

The most common is a 25% leverage, which means if you invest 100$ they borrow 25$ and invest 125$ in your name. Stock rise, decline and dividends are 25% more. There are also fees to pay for borrowing or course (these will be included in the management fee for that ETF). \n\n3x leverage is extreme. Tech is already very volatile. So it's not for the fain of heart. When it goes down, it will go down 3x times more as well.",

Put you cash in a high interest saving account ETFs, and slowly add to your positions. You don't need a lot of ETFs, but I recommend a major position into the US market (like S&amp;P500 or total market) and some secondary position in international (Dev. Countries Ex. US).\n\nVery important, what are your goals? How long do you have? Will you need the cash soon? Because that style of investing is Growth and it's for the long term. Learn to know about yourself, how do you react when your investment go down, when you have to sell,... Maybe dividend investing would be more suited for you depending on your personality and needs.",

If you can select arbitrary start points you can select the slope of perceived gains. \n\nIt occurred to me because meta is in there and i bought the dip on meta.\n\nMeta had this huge covid income surge that swelled it's price followed by a \"let's spend billions on vr that nobody wants\" (dip) followed by a \"thats dumb let's not do that\" which resulted in gains. The percentage gain to now can be manipulated a lot by just moving a month or two.  \n\nWhen your list is down to 5 stocks, and one of them is already noted to have that issue, how you selected your start point matters allot to interpretation.\n\nWas it selected to maximize the percieved gains of those 5 stocks?

    "postText": "Hello there! So, when it comes to trading, I'm a complete noob. I've recently been watching YouTube videos about support and resistance (S&amp;R) levels. \n\nUsing Heikin-Ashi candlestick charts and a 4-hour timeframe, I've been analyzing Uber's performance. I now want to know if my levels of support and resistance\u00a0for Uber are accurate. \n\nIf someone with experience could look over my analysis, I would be extremely grateful. Please feel free to make suggestions or criticisms. My ears are open! In this fascinating field, I'm eager to learn and hone my abilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odv3nl584d4b1.png?width=1375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49bbbce855937cdeaf8cfd1ca4a578546222c746\n\nAlso, if you have any other tips, feel free to share them...",

I use a **fixed range volume profile** tool and set it on groups of candles that look like the stop losses haven't been triggered by a more recent lower candle. Stop losses are often around 10% below the prices where the purchases were made.\n\nYou can take your sample chart and test it on groups of candles so you can see where later dips stopped, presumably because most stop losses are gone.\n\nPay attention to trend lines and check the short interest and short volumes. A stock isn't going to rebound much if there is a large short interest or the short volumes on green candles are high.\n\nNever bet your last dollar. You can make a comeback with a dollar but when you are broke, you just get to watch the other kids play.",

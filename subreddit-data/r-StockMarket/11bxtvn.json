To harvest it resources and keep specific genes/DNA Read some Sumerian text. Who determines the first pharaohs of Egypt? The sphinx is much older then we initially thought. Those structures were here long before us. We were placed here. We carved our own images and text in to these structures. There are no records of how they were built. That\u2019s because we didn\u2019t build them. Mars was habitable at one point. Once the sun expanded and burnt off its atmosphere and water and used up that planets resources. They placed us here on earth as we entered the godly locks zone. We were genetically engineered between a few different species of animals and with limited intelligence in their own likeness. There is a missing link between ape and man. This is where hybrid engineering comes into play. Think moles, apes and gods from the sky (Anunnaki) we are left to our own accord to some degree. Higher level, we are a farm of genetics and harvesters\u2026 in a glass prison. This system is put into place so we don\u2019t think to much and work day to day towards their goals.

So the answer to your question is probably \"We don't know\" (not sure exactly which 2.2 trillion op is referring too. It's possible they're referring to the 2.3 trillion Rumsfeld told congress they couldn't track on September 10th 2001, (date is probably a coincidence. ...probably) in which case there's a good answer on [ask historians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pldkd4/what_happened_to_the_23trillion_rumsfeld/hcaubgi/) .\n\nso it would be more accurate to say there's 2.2 trillion we don't know if it's missing or not. (which is still a problem). And while congress hasn't turned a blind eye to it as OP suggests there's not much they've done about it besides telling us to do better. It's not like they've done any radical like cut our budget. What would happen to their precious pork then?",

            "comment": "I read an article recently about how they are planning on making high end gaming headsets again. Like $299+ \n\nA long time ago when I worked at GameStop they were known for having the best headsets. With some going for $899+. Their quality fell off and the market space got very competitive over the last 15 years. So possibly related to that? The profit margins for GameStop were huge on those things. I can only imagine what it was for the company itself. \n\nIt could also be someone from WSB that's just making a random dumb play. \n\nI have some shares that I got near the bottom. Nothing worth really talking about. But I'm bullish on the company .",

A black swan event occurs, and instantly the stock trades at $80. Your helpful stop kicks in because the stock is below $180, and now you have instantly sold at $80 and lost more than half your money. \n\nAlternatively, you could set a stop-limit to have a price at which it triggers, and then a lower price at which it doesn't trigger, so you avoid the catastrophic sale mentioned in the example above. except now you're still stuck holding the stock after it went from $200 to $80.\n\nTo put it simply: no, sometimes you're just toast.",

Viktor Yanukovych was Ukraine's president at one point but he was clearly a Russian puppet. The people of Ukraine ran him off after a corrupt election which is why Russia started invading Crimea. Soviet Union ultimately disbanded in Russia because people got fed up with it and revolted. Sitting still and giving the government more power to abuse you will never work.",

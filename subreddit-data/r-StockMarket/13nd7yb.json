I\u2019ll show you with two scenarios, in scenario B, they will buy a \u201cbook\u201d for 10 dollars and deduct it as a business expense.\n\n\nScenario A:\n\nRevenue : 100\n\nExpenses: 50\n\nIncome before tax: 50\n\nTax: (50*tax rate) [say it\u2019s .2]\n\nProfit: 40\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nScenario B\n\nRevenue : 100\n\nExpenses: 60 (because they bought the book)\n\n\nIncome before tax: 40\n\nTax: (40*tax rate) [say it\u2019s .2]\n\nProfit: 32 \n\n\nSo the owner of the company doesn\u2019t get more profit, they make less. All the book does as a \u201ctax deductible/ write off\u201d is increase their expenses and thus lower the company\u2019s profit and total tax paid (because they had higher expenses). It\u2019s only useful in the sense that you can reinvest in the business with pretax money (buy a new plant to expand your business). This is exactly the point of deductions because the government will inevitably earn more as the company expands its operations. Thus tax deductions incentivize growth, because this means tax revenues will grow as well.",

Ultimately in the short term the company reduces its tax liability by writing off an expense, but the purpose of the write of is that the government wants to incentivize certain business expenses.

The statement is not true if a law changes such that an existing expense becomes a tax write off. \"Tax write offs\" do \"save money\" when the thing that changes is what gets classified as a write off, rather than the variable being total expenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original point being made in comments above expressed a comedic fear that a law might change such that an existing expense (ie, buying the book) might no longer be classified as a write-off, meaning the tax advantage would go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully that makes sense.

If you pulled out equity from your house via a heloc loan, would you want the government to tax your loan? No because the 20k heloc you pull from your house is transferring 20k from equity in your house into 20k of cash via a loan. Your net worth has not changed and you have not created an economic gain. In fact, you will lose money due to the interest cost associated with the loan. \n\nAlso this system only works in very low interest rate environments and In environments where your confident your assets will increase in value.

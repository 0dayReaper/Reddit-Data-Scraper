It might have been 600,000 before closing some oil deals; now it's 520,000.\n\nThere was a time when it was 350,000.\n\nOr much less.

You play it and level up.\n\nThe levels are generally:\n\nCash &gt; margin &gt; options (different levels) &gt; futures.\n\nEach of those levels are tools that get used differently so you use shares like you are now, you use margin, you use options, etc. All of them gets used.\n\nWhen you're in a phase where your account drawdowns are small enough that you can make it up with savings, you be more aggressive on accessing and learning each level.\n\nSo for most people I think of savings about $1,000 or $500 per month so somewhere around $36,000 and $18,000 over 3 years.\n\nSo people love to hate me for this but I might have a typical drawdown ... typical...of $40,000 to $80,000.\n\nThe reason I point that out is imagine if you lost $80,000 tomorrow. I mean gone. It's not \"oh my stocks will come back\".\n\nThat's when your account gets too big to be financed by your job; that's when you are moving into the mid-tier of investing.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubject on Debt:\n\nYou want as MUCH debt as you can afford. All of it. Give me more of it. I have like 2 mortgage payments in margin alone. Like my margin costs right now are \\~$8,000/month or such.\n\nThat represents \\~10% of my comfortable investment income. That's how I determine how much I can afford.\n\nThis works at any scale so for instance $22/hr you'd probably want a $381/month margin payment at these rates.\n\nI can't truly pick out where you want your margin level to be or why but that's comparative.\n\nThere's so many reasons why this is superior but the number one reason is competitive advantage. Use the house as an analogy.\n\nWhen you go to buy a property you're bidding on the property and someone else also bids. The seller sells to the highest bidder.\n\nThe highest bidder gets the house, the loser gets nothing.\n\nSince the house represents future cash flow the highest bidder gets future income, the loser gets...nothing.\n\nWho can bid more on a house; all things being equal? The person in cash? Or the person who has the same cash and accesses debt financing?\n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nIn stocks. It works exactly the same way, but it's hard for people to understand why they always lose.\n\nThey lose because they want to buy low and sell high.\n\nBut someone like me with debt financing buys higher than they can, and sells lower than they can. Because I can out bid them and still make money.\n\nSo the cash person waits for better prices and never gets them, and then when they finally see those prices, to someone like me that stock looks like complete dog shjt and there's a reason it's trading at such a good deal.\n\nThink of a starving man. A starving man might eat a moldy rotting carcass covered in flies. With debt financing I'm good at fat...I can wait until the choicest meats come along.\n\nIt's this psychology that drives everything in the markets. It's the principle reason I compare sheep to warriors. If you want to be a warrior you're going to have to learn how WE whales think...because how we think determines success.",

But you're not really going to learn the markets when everything's all quiet and happy.\n\nFor now you should master steady savings rate and treat that as the buying power replenishment needed to finance a business.\n\nJust think of a portfolio as a business; it has a store, it has items on the shelves. You buy the items at a cost and sell it for more than cost. You have expenses. At the end of the day everything needs to result in profit or you go out of business.\n\nIn your business, when you have no customers do you just go on vacation and spend money on your credit card while looters come in and ransack the place and you whistle past the graveyard? Nope. But that's what all these fools who say \"time in the market &gt;&gt; than timing the market\" like to think.\n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nSomething practical you can do is build a proper position. Find some shares you want and track its cost basis. On Tradingview it might look something like this:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZ9KJhql/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZ9KJhql/)  \n\n\nThe orange line represents a hypothetical cost basis adjusting per the current dividend rate. I didn't buy UNP there I actually shorted it and made a quick killing; fyi the yellow box is my preferred buy zone. I'll wait for that.\n\nBrokerages won't adjust your cost basis so YOU will need a method to do the work.\n\nI use tradingview to keep track of a lot of variables. Someday I can go over what kind of tracking I do.\n\nBut for owning shares this is the most basic.\n\nLet's take the same view and hypothetically I bought where the orange line was, and bought again where the price is at the recent lows.\n\n$191 let's say.\n\n200+191 / 2 = 195.5 my new cost basis. In this example the Brokerage will adjust that for you. This is a basic DCA tactic. My orange line now looks like this:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/uPvqfDft/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uPvqfDft/)\n\nHere's what I want you to start to get used to seeing quite clearly.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZJIRDJMV/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZJIRDJMV/)\n\nWhen should I buy HRZN? What price is good? I actually gave you quite useful tool to determine this. It's relative in a way. Remember there are different tools.\n\nWe are at the mercy of a cash entry, we use debt, options and futures to change our fate.\n\nBut when creating a position it's all the same; it's like cash.\n\nIf I created a position that traces back to the bottom orange lines which are around COVID time period then I'd probably NEVER buy again except when price is within a striking distance of the orange line.. Which is rarely.\n\nI'd never have bought at that highest orange line because when you draw it and extend it out you quickly see price would rarely ever beat it.\n\nBuying when you're above the orange line...the adjusted cost basis is called:\n\n**Leveraging a trade.**\n\nIt's why they never get anywhere their whole lives and just earn 9% average and retire at 65 like everyone else.\n\nYou could have put $100,000 in AMZN at IPO, forgot about it, and have $19,000,000 today at $100,000 cost.\n\nOr you could keep putting money in the whole way up and when it pulls back 30% like it did this year... you could have $20,000,000 today but at $4,000,000 in cost or something like that.\n\nWhat's better? 19 / 0.1?\n\nOr 20 / 4?\n\nRaising the cost basis is what you want to avoid. So you buy whenever the price is below your \"orange line\".\n\nLet's zoom in on HRZN.\n\nWhere do you think I sold in this image?\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/mbYT2dD6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/mbYT2dD6/)\n\nI'll show you:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/LJhz1UVB/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LJhz1UVB/)\n\nGreen arrow.\n\nWhy? Because it's above my orange line. I'm profitable. Because of many other things too.\n\nHow do you think I sold? Deep ITM Covered Calls. Why?\n\nI want to cover the entire gain above that orange line.\n\nThese aren't the tools I'm suggesting you start diving into; just building a narrative for you to start to think about.\n\nSo to summarize.\n\n* When you buy a stock. Draw an orange line at your cost basis.\n* Slant the orange line if it pays dividends.\n* Only buy below the orange line.\n* Unless you want to leverage a trade never buy above the orange line.\n* Leveraging a trade has uses but it'll just cost you more in the long run (19:0.1 vs 20:4 aka 5:1).\n* If one trade is above the orange line let it ride; move on to something else or sell it depending on buying power.\n\nLastly that brings me to an introduction of debt and why you use it.\n\nLet's say you bought $100,000 of something and it pays you $10,000 a year in cash flow.\n\nLet's say at the end of the year it is worth $110,000. What is your buying power?\n\nIt's $110,000 equity + $10,000 in cash.\n\nWith debt financing you can now buy $20,000 additional something....anything you want. A stock that's in the toilet. A car. Lemons. gold...blah blah.\n\nThe debt financing lets you utilize your gains without selling them following the rule:  \n**Never lose your position**\n\nAnd when you do that; you get to choose when to sell something and continue to operate your business buying things cheap. You don't have to cut gains so you can buy the next cheap item to sell that. You are more in control of the timing than someone on cash who if they see a great deal needs to raise money from SOMEWHERE.\n\nOver time...if you have cash flow. \n\nWell as an example I bought $XLE on debt 2 weeks ago.\n\nI paid off all the shares in cash flow from trades over the last 2 weeks. I own the shares at effectively $0 cost basis.\n\nMost people count their job as cash flow. They pay for their stocks with their job. Which is why they work until they die.\n\nI pay for my stocks with investment income. That's my job....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I know this is ALSO a lot to take in so hopefully the bullet points helps you with the basic entry part. Get good at accounting your actual cost basis (not blindly whatever the brokerage tells you) and making your decisions based on that; then focus on getting good at FOLLOWING THE RULE of always lowering your cost basis.\n\nI lowered my XLE cost basis to $0. If I were buying with job income I'd never buy another share of XLE in my life...but I'm buying with investment income. That's different and can be saved for another day.",

Well that\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to buy more, cheaper.   Then in 2065 you\u2019ll start selling it all.\n\nGiven that the total market return (including reinvesting dividends which doesn\u2019t show up on the price history) averages around 9% per year in the long run, you\u2019d expect to sell it for around 30x that price or $6753.",

The only thing he can actually claim is being in the right place at the right time from being born to wealthy parents to starting a worthless company that got bought by Compaq in the middle of the first tech bubble to getting acquired by PayPal then Ebay shortly thereafter, then using that money to fund Tesla before forcing out Tesla's true co-founders.\n\nMusk isn't stupid, but he is no fucking genius and his executive decisions have consistently and repeatedly demonstrated that.  If anything, with the opportunities he's had I see more squandered potential than I do actual success due to his unfortunate preoccupation with believing in his own mythos.  Musk's most reliable and valuable asset is and always has been leading a charmed life, which only narrowly beats out his lack of scruples about treating the people that work with and for him like trash.\n\nBut go on, be a follower.  Choose heroes.  Eventually you'll get exploited enough that you'll understand why you shouldn't have any of those.",

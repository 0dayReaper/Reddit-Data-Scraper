    "postText": "Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.\n\nNvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.\n\nHere are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRevenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected\n\nAdj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected\n\nGaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected\n\nData center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected\n\nShares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions \u2014 accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.",

Can VR grow without graphic cards? Wouldn't server be needed to allow multiple end users to be in the same VR session?\n\nAgain, i am no expert, but to me, social media standalones are dying because the true revenue source is ads. We are flooded with ads now of days, so at some point, there is less value there. \n\nSo if Meta wants VR and whatever else, graphic cards and servers are needed to make that a reality. \nAnd NDVA products need to be purchased again and again as thing change. Sort of like an infinity money glitch lol\n\nAnd I could be completely off base, just typing out loud",

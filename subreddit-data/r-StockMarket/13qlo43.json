    "postText": "Small caps (IWM) surged at yesterday's open, but their big brothers SPY and QQQ failed to join the party, struggling to break free from sideways movement for the first three hours.\n\nEventually, they succumbed to selling pressure as debt talks once again hit a stalemate. The subsequent decline gained momentum, impacting all indices and sectors except for energy, which received a boost from hawkish remarks by the Saudi oil minister.\n\nIn the pre-market, US equity futures are trending downward, reflecting a negative sentiment ahead of the release of FOMC meeting minutes later today. Overnight, China experienced significant weakness due to renewed concerns about Covid, while Europe is facing challenges with lagging business confidence, surging food inflation, and the ongoing debt talks. The market is growing increasingly apprehensive and eagerly awaits progress on the debt ceiling issue. Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak this morning, and given her tendency to sound the alarm on default risks, it's unlikely we have any chance of a substantial rebound until after the FOMC minutes are released later this afternoon.\n\nI post these daily, so lmk if you like them!

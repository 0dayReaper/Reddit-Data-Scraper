    "postText": "Sen. Josh Hawley has introduced a bill that would ban members of Congress from trading and owning stocks, using the name of his legislation to take a jab at Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n\nHawley on Tuesday introduced the Pelosi Act \u2014\u00a0or the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act \u2014 renewing a legislative push to curtail stock trading by lawmakers that has failed over the last few years.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress and their spouses shouldn\u2019t be using their position to get rich on the stock market,\u201d Hawley tweeted in announcing his bill.\n\nThe GOP senator previously introduced legislation last year seeking to ban lawmakers and their spouses from holding stocks or making new transactions while in office.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Pelosi\u2019s office for comment.\n\nHawley, like a number of other Republicans, has focused on the former Speaker and her family in pushing to ban stock trading by members of Congress.\n\nLast year Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul Pelosi, sold millions of dollars worth of shares of a computer chipmaker as the House prepared to vote on a bill focused on domestic chip manufacturing. A spokesman for Pelosi said at the time that he sold the shares at a loss.\n\nMembers of both parties signaled interest in legislation barring stock trades after then-Sen. Richard Burr, who at the time was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, unloaded stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently closed a probe of his trading activities without taking action.\n\nLawmakers have yet to be able to come up with a plan that garners enough support from both sides of the aisle to get a bill through Congress. Democrats in 2022 scrapped a plan to vote on such legislation before the midterm elections, even after Pelosi reversed course and expressed openness to colleagues voting for stock trading reform.\n\nAlong with Hawley\u2019s bill, a bipartisan duo in the House has introduced a bill this year on the topic. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Chip Roy introduced the Trust in Congress Act this month, marking the third time the pair have introduced the legislation.\n\nSource: [https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3828504-hawley-introduces-pelosi-act-banning-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks/](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3828504-hawley-introduces-pelosi-act-banning-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks/)\n\nSenator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill called \"Pelosi Act\" that would ban congress members from trading stocks. Do you think the bill will get enough votes to pass this time?",

If Hawley was serious about stopping this, he wouldn\u2019t have used a former high ranking policy members name, especially because both sides abuse the market. While Pelosi may be the most famous right now, I bet on sheer numbers (given the typical backgrounds of Rep &amp; Dems) that Republicans have probably abused their power with stock trading far more than Dems (purely speculation). \n\nHe knows Dems won\u2019t back the bill with the trolling title, which of course Hawley and the party will grandstand about once it happens. They (Dems) will likely counter with something more appropriate and the Republicans will refuse, making the naming of the bill somehow the most important point.\n\nAt the end it won\u2019t pass, or it will with heavy concessions to the point where it\u2019s almost unenforceable. \n\nThe problem with Dems is they know their base is pinning for this and will lambast the people who go against it. Republicans base care about this, but it will be no party members death if it doesn\u2019t get passed. So although Rep drafted the bill (with a troll name specifically to create pushback by Dems) they fully expect to leverage the backlash Dems receive to add riders for things they know Dems would typically not vote for.\n\nThis is the best and worst thing about the Democratic Party. Their base (for the most part) holds them accountable, example: Sinema will never see a seat w/Dems again after her term is done. The downside is it allows Republicans to manipulate them by proposing Legislation the Dem base is thirsty for and then sandbagging it to get more provisions/riders to advance their platform.\n\nThe Dems are like hostage negotiators when a criminal takes a hostage and has the hostage negotiation tactics Bible right next to him. Everything they do is predictable because their voting base is so predictable. If Dems had any hair on their peaches they would just accept the Bill name and then push it back on Republicans to get a bill passed that they likely really didn\u2019t want to.",

Even if we assume he had zero inside knowledge from Congress you'd expect him to outperform considerably over the years investing in things like MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, etc.\n\nWhat would be more persuasive is if there was a particular single case that could be looked at to determine if there was any likelihood of insider knowledge that his wife might have given him.  The examples I have seen--like the voting on the CHIPS Act--have not been particularly persuasive though.  If you pay attention to Congress then you'd know what bills are being discussed and a lot of the bill's content (a lot of the hearings are even public), when they are being voted on, and the likely outcome of any vote before it is made.  That would actually be part of Mr. Pelosi's job to know these things.\n\nBut a law of some kind is really needed because of cases like Senator Burr where it seems 100% clear that he abused his knowledge he gained through secret hearings to financially benefit himself, and yet the SEC chose to do nothing.

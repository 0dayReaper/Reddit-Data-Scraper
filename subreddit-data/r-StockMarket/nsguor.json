I read on an internet chat room or website that a specific security has a large number of fails; are these sources reliable?\n\n&gt; Investors can and should verify the number of failures to deliver in a specific security by checking publicly available data on failures to deliver. The Commission publishes on its website failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month. For current failures to deliver information, see\u00a0http://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/failsdata.htm.\n\n&gt; Investors should always be cautious that issuers, promoters, or shareholders may be seeking to stimulate buying interest by making false, misleading or unfounded statements in internet chat rooms or other such forums about alleged large \u201cnaked\u201d short positions in some smaller issuers. Some individuals may encourage other investors to buy these issuers\u2019 securities by claiming that there will be an imminent short squeeze, in which the alleged \u201cnaked\u201d short sellers will be forced to cover open short positions at increasing prices. These claims in fact may be false.\n\n&gt; Modified: 4/8/2015\n\n\nSo the meme stock phenomenon is not new?",

Now whether they are accountable is certainly questionable. Who is supposed to check that stuff? The SEC? And that\u2019s why we are here. Make some money and trap these bastards with their hands in the cookie jar, so they can pay their tiny fines and lie through their lawyers about how they are innocent. The system is rigged, so we might as well take care of them our own way. The value of a stock comes from its buyers.

Has anyone ever looked at the fundamentals of almost any tech company, bio pharma, EV, cannabis,  you wouldn't touch half of them based on fundamentals.  The system is rigged and the retail investor is there to keep the boat floating while Wall Street reaps huge profits by fucking retail with all kinds of illegal trading actions.  Just take a look at how many firms are assessed fines for illegal trading, it will make your head spin, and to them it's just the cost of doing business. The SEC, FINRA, DTTC are all a joke. Wall Street is self regulated by these entities, let that sink in, self regulated. Who do you think manages the non-profit FINRA investments? The companies they \"regulate\".",

He\u2019s saying you can\u2019t go after shorts even though they are shorting with shares they don\u2019t have but yet can\u2019t go after them for cheating. What a dork make sense when you talk. Did they short a shorty amc theater company. Yes but did they cheat and use naked shares to do it. Yes. So there\u2019s gotta be judgement day on both angles. Technically and fundamentally amc should be shorted to the ground. But they didn\u2019t need to cheat to do it. Only way amc sticks around is if investors pay for it. Which is retarded.",

I am explaining how he's actually intimately with this issue.\n\nBy the way, I did factor in COVID when I stated that Trump's spending was irresponsible.  Look at [this](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/federal-budget-receipts-and-outlays).  Trump cut taxes and increased spending *before* COVID hit in 2020.  He did this in both 2018 and 2019 when the economy was booming.  Trump spent more money than Obama even though Obama had to combat the Great Recession.\n\nAny Economics textbook will tell you that when the economy is booming, a president is supposed to raise taxes and cut spending so that in times of recession, he can do the opposite in order to stimulate the economy.  Trump ignored his economic advisors because he simply doesn't care.  It's documented that he literally said, \"Yeah, but I won't be here\" to his advisors.  He really is that insane.\n\nThe fact that he cut taxes on the most wealthy and increased spending led to the deficit (and the debt) skyrocketing once COVID hit.  He ended up with the honor of literally increasing the debt by more than any other US president except for Washington and Lincoln (who both contended with civil wars).  Trump really took crazy to a new level.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I agree that President Biden's spending plan is outrageous.  I believe we should literally cut spending by half even despite COVID's damage to the supply chain.  I am desperately hoping that the liberals will find someone else to run, someone more responsible and intelligent.  But, if the option is between a mediocre president and a maniac, I think the choice is obvious.\n\nHowever, I do unequivocally agree with Biden that we need to increase the taxes on the wealthy.  The wealthy *literally* have all the cash.  The money supply is *literally* in their bank accounts.  So, taxing the bottom 80% is pointless because they literally don't have much money to tax.\n\nWealth inequality is at a 100-year all-time high.  This means literally that most of the cash in the money supply is being diverted into the wealthy's bank accounts.  The top 10% own 70% of the wealth.  The top 1% own 33% of all the wealth.  I don't think people really appreciate what this means.  1% of our population owns a *third* of *everything*.  Take a look outside.  This means that for every third house, the 1% effectively owns it instead of you and I.  Another way is to look at the map of the US.  The 1% owns an entire third of the entire US.  Or, the bottom 50% of the people have to all fit in 1% of the map.  It's really insane.  So, when Trump cut taxes on the wealthy, he literally widened this gap (obviously, for his own benefit).\n\nI don't think most people understand how the economy works.  GDP is like a fixed pie because it only grows about 2-3% a year.  So, *when someone makes more money, it necessarily means that someone makes less*.  Yes, a person working may create small net gains for society but most of their profits actually come from taking money from someone else.  So when Jeff Bezos made $100 billion, he may have made a better company but the increased productivity accounts for a small fraction of his company.  Most of the value actually came from consolidating profits from many other retail companies like Walmart, Best Buy, and Michaels.  His gain was other people's loss.\n\nPeople incorrectly believe that capitalism's purpose is to ensure property rights.  Or, that free markets will always lead to the best outcome.  I disagree.  Capitalism's purpose is to create a system that maximizes the happiness of all members of society.  It just happens that free markets lead to this.  In other words, it's not only about fairness.  It's also about tweaking the economy and taxes so that everyone is working efficiently and happily even if it leads to some unfairness.",

I don't believe for a second most of them actually believe the bullshit they're spewing. Except maybe MTG who is a psychopath. \n\nDebates over the debt ceiling are not new. What's new is the idea that we would fuck over every single citizen of the United States to make a point about federal spending. Do you really think that's the best way to reduce spending? \n\nCompromise goes both ways. The fact republicans are refusing to look at closing certain tax loopholes or raising taxes should be a red flag that someones not negotiating in good faith or willing to actually address the problem. We spent too much so we need to cut spending and raise taxes. That simple.",

You can always cut spending and rely on taxes to reduce the debt. \n\nJust like in Singapore, Finland, Switzerland, Japan, and China. Their governments are not in deficit, and they slowly accumulate wealth. \n\nInstead, Democrats are trying to print money to spend on their social security programs that are encouraging people to remain homeless and not work- which causes the crazy inflation you see now. And the \u201camazing\u201d job market- because ppl that do not find jobs are not considered unemployed. \n\nSpending has limits, whether you like it or not, and at a certain point becomes unsustainable. America is way past that limit, and is experiencing the consequences of going past that limit. \n\nThat being said, republicans have their pet projects that they have to cut as well. \n\nBut cutting spending is unpopular in US, cause the average US voter is like the deadbeat in the family that doesn\u2019t plan ahead. \n\nThat\u2019s why California has failed to build any High Speed Rail, when Europe, Japan, and China have surpassed US. \n\nThat\u2019s why the transportation system in US is miles behind every other developed country, such as China, japan, Korea, UK, and France. \n\nUS is just so dysfunctional, because of an inability to find middle ground ON BOTH SIDES.

The reason they don\u2019t want to cut that umbilical cord is because they rely on the black vote to get into power.\n\nIt\u2019s twisted but it\u2019s true. Then they gas light the shit out of the libs with the help of CNN, and the cycle continues.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating how many young libs actually believe the Republican Party were the pro slavery party back. The extent of the gas lighting of useful idiots is off the chart. Tell most libs that Lincoln was a Republican and they think you\u2019re spouting \u2018Russian disinformation\u2019. The number they\u2019ve done on young minds is off the chart. Even the Nazis would stand in awe of todays leftist propaganda.",

It was the Democratic party. You're missing a few key facts though. In 1964 the parties started to flip, the proof is all around you. The fact that while Republicans used to be in the north now they are all in the South. Southern heritage in no longer a Democratic thing its a Republican thing. While most black people used to support the Republicans they mostly support the Democrats now. I think the push back you're getting from some liberals is that Lincoln would 100% be a Democrat if he was alive today. Btw there is plenty of ignorance to go around. If you think it's only young liberals you're biased and not paying attention.",

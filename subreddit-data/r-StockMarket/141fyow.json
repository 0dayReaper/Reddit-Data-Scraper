    "postText": " Hey lads, hope yall had a great weekend and had a chance to just chill out and relax. Mine was super busy but still fun (not so much relaxing lol). Anyway, recently I\u2019ve been super into space after finally getting around to watching Interstellar\u2026 I know im super late but my gf finally got me to sit down and watch it with her lool and it honestly opened up this obsession for me. I\u2019ve been binging space docs, youtube videos, and even the conspiracies of the moon landing etc. Anyone kind of go through the same phase after watching a movie or even Interstellar lol?\n\nYou know the obsession is real when you start looking to see if there\u2019s any cool companies in the space industry worth investing in. Does anyone know any good ones? I obvs really like SpaceX (the idea of space tourism is crazy to me) but they\u2019re private and the only way I could see myself investing in them is through a private equity company who already has an investment in them. After doing a little more research into the space space lmao, I really narrowed it down to SpaceX and wanted to see if I could find an investment company who has a good amount invested into them.\n\nAfter doing some research I found a company that had a really good (early) investment into SpaceX. The company is called Stack Capital who are a company who invests in growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I had mixed emotions about this because I\u2019ve never invested into a company like this before. So I wasn\u2019t sure what I should do. They seem to have a solid leadership team with a bunch of experience which is making me feel a bit a better about everything tho. It seems they invested **$5M USD back in 2021**, which is actually a month after Inspiration4 sent four private citizens to orbit including Jared Isaacman (the first all private crew). I\u2019m hoping one day that space travel becomes more normalized through companies like SpaceX so I can get up there and see how crazy it is for myself lool.\n\nSo like I said I\u2019m really wanting to invest into this sector especially SpaceX and this company seems to have one of the best investments that I could find into them. Anyone know of any other companies with a similar investment on them? I\u2019m not sure how I feel about investing into a company like this either so I could really use some other ppls experiences on this so please let me know if you\u2019ve had positive or negative experiences with companies like Stack.\n\n[Portfolio Presentation](https://www.stackcapitalgroup.com/presentation)",

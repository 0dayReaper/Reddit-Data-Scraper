Earnings, medicament releases, etc. I was making bank with sentiment trading and only stopped because my money is tied in Gamestop right now.\n\nIt's a matter of risk reward. Lots of people here love to self congratulate for being smart long term investors who will eventually achieve financial freedom, but the basic strategy doesn't make sense. The profits from investing or trading are = investment x time x potential. And potential = risk. When you have a lot of money, you can afford to avoid risk. When you have little money and avoid risk, then all you have left is time. Hence the 50 years of waiting.\n\nMany people choose the low time, high risk way instead. It just has the problem that you can easily lose it all over and over again. So you start small, and gradually go up as you develop your strategy. Most people just try to rush it, blow their accounts and give up, though, which the 50 years waiting crowd takes as an argument of why you should avoid risk.",

American workers are some of the most productive workers in the world, yet so many millions don\u2019t even have the money to invest. Why?\n\nWhen you\u2019re barely making it, it\u2019s certainly not because of government taxes. You don\u2019t pay that much in taxes. It\u2019s because of the employer *tax* on your productivity.\n\nThe whole idea that you have to make money off other people\u2019s labor in order to not be destitute in retirement is a sham.\n\nWhen the Boomers were entering the workforce, a high school education was all you needed to buy a house and feed a small family on one income because companies paid living wages back then. We are much more productive now, but we make much less in real terms. Why? Where is all of that actual extra money going?",

I suggest everyone spend some time in a Medicaid funded facility as a visitor or volunteer. If that doesn't motivate you to save your money then nothing will. It's absolutely hell on those places.

My portfolio consists of stocks yielding over 10% in dividend income, but the real money comes from selling weekly puts and calls, naked or otherwise on stocks like TSLA, MRNA, and yes AMC.  AMC has huge premiums at $70 strike.  When it comes to options, the money to be made comes from selling, not buying.  I had lunch with the President of thinkorswim in 2006, and he told me that the sellers win over 85% of the time.  Of course, this requires your attention almost 100% in the event some news comes out that goes against you, but being retired I love having something to keep me interested.\n\nMy profits on selling calls and puts or credit spreads is running about 150% of what I need to live on, so the extra dividends are reinvested to give me more margin to play with.",

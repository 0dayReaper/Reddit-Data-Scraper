    "postText": "We've seen for the last 15 years that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has waned in relevance, when compared to the SPX and Nasdaq indicies in terms of being representative of the market, as tech and high growth stocks took an increasingly large portion of total stock market cap.  I spent a few years in wealth management and even mentioning the Dow was like mentioning an ancient, obsolete thing. \n\nIn today's market, the Dow might be the most relevant it's been in a generation, as the market becomes completely bifurcated between stocks that represent the incoming era of automation (this year's proxy buzzword being \"AI\"), and stocks that represent, essentially, everything else. Today's premarket action is a strong example of this, as NVDA's earnings are pulling up everything related to AI/automation, bringing up SPX/Nasdaq futures, while the rest of the market remains tepid, uncertain, and beholden to anxieties related to the debt ceiling, inflation, recession, etc. We truly have a have and have-not market.",

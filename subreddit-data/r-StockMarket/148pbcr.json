No, my job is to allocate assets to the asset classes that have the highest probability of success given macro economic data.\n\nThe whole doomed thing is a misinterpretation of reality.  If you expect a credit crisis due to bank failures you would allocate way less to equities and more to assets that do well in deflationary recessions.  Long term bonds, gold, etc.  and also raise a ton of liquidity that pays 5% in money markets currently to be used for discounted opportunities.",

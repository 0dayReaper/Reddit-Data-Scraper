This however is not a good thing when shares outstanding increase because you're either directly diluting investors and increasing cash position or you're financing debt with convertible equity, or you're paying staff with equity and saving cash on payroll expenses. \n\nCash Flow:\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/k5K0gRCc/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/k5K0gRCc/image.png)\n\nBasically, they are cash flow positive and this is because of noncash expenses that are treated as expenses following GAAP procedures. There are many companies that have negative GAAP EPS however when you adjust for noncash expenses, they have positive adjusted EPS. My personal take on these companies is not favorable because oftentimes they dilute their investors through heavy stock-based compensation programs. A company with Positive GAAP EPS is much easier to value and one that is repurchasing its shares to where shares outstanding is not growing is even better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're asking why it's down, a better question would be why it's up around 50% in 1 month.",

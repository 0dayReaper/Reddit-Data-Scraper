            "comment": "Any fool investing in MCD's now deserves what is coming.\r  \n\r  \nI stopped at two of them three Sundays ago to try to order three egg biscuits for breakfast.\r  \n\r  \nSat in the first one's drive through line for seven minutes, then at the speaker for five - nobody was taking orders. I drove around and waited at for the car ahead of me to get its change (that took a LONG time). Most people kept leaving the line to give up on it, but I got to the window and ordered. Except that I didn't ... \"we don't have egg biscuits\" is what I was told. What he meant was that there wasn't a button for that, or that he couldn't find one - so he was just going to charge me for bacon egg and cheese biscuits and then throw away the bacon and cheese, but of course charge me $13.XX for the privilege. He even checked with the manager, and that was the best they could come up with for one of the most common items they sell.\r  \n\r  \nSo I left, and made it to another McD's before breakfast ended. This time I walked in. I was NOT ready for what I walked in to, though. Eight of the most unhappy people - who had already ordered - were waiting for their food. Then I looked around me; the tables that had people in them ALSO had no food.\r  \n\r  \nThe service and quality of McD's has dropped off like a rock into a lake. I wasted 45 minutes across two McD's and ended up with no food to show for it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's has to be losing clients left and right. Nobody in their right mind would wait 20 minutes for McD's food AFTER having had to wait 10 minutes, or more, to order it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's old promise of \"If you don't get your order in five minutes or less, your order is free\" promise is gone.",

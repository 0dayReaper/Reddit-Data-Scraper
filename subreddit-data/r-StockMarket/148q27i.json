If one had bought and hold the return would be x1811.398x with a harmonic mean return of 9.43858%.\n\n\nThe years labeled as panics had returns of:\n\n\n1965: 12.45%\n\n\n1981: -4.91%\n\n\n1999: 21.04%\n\n\n2019: 31.49%.\n\n\nThe annual returns on \u201cB\u201d years are\n\n\n1953: -0.99%\n\n\n1962: -8.73%\n\n\n1972: 18.98%\n\n\n1980: 32.42%\n\n\n1989: 31.69%\n\n\n1999: 21.04%\n\n\n2007: 5.49%\n\n\n2016: 11.96%\n\n\nThe years where the index had returns lower than -5% were 1962 (a sell year,) 1969 (a buy year,) 1973 (an unmarked non- invest year,) 1974 (an unmarked non- invest year,) 1977 (an unmarked non- invest year,) 2001, (an unmarked non- invest year,) 2008 (an unmarked non- invest year,) and 2022 (an unmarked non- invest year.) \n\n\nThe years with returns above 30% were 1954 (an unmarked non- invest year,) 1955 (an unmarked non- invest year,) 1958 (a buy year,) 1980 (a sell year,) 1985 (a buy year,) 1989 (a sell year,) 1991 (an unmarked, non-invest year,) 1995 (an unmarked, non- invest year,) 1997 (an unmarked invested year,) 2013 (an unmarked invest year,) 2018 (a panic year.)\n\n\nFollowing this rule one would have historically (since beginning in 1951 with my data,) one would have achieved a higher mean annual return, however a staggeringly lower overall return with the number of years non- invested.\n\n\nThe years listed as panics include only one down year and none of the major crashes which occurred historically.\n\n\nThose are my numbers.",

            "comment": "Even if it's accurate (and it isn't), it ignores oil.\n\nThe end of oil is coming, and any forward looking projections that ignore this fact are going to be wrong. I.e. one day pretty soon, the make belief world that economists base the economy off of is going to come crashing down, and us engineers and ecologists will be standing there saying \"duh\".\n\nReports like the IESO pathways to decarbonization try to paint a picture of what a replacement economy of green power looks like, and as an engineer of 20 years in the power industry, let me tell you, it's Pie in the sky. Maybe if we started building nuclear 10-15 years ago. Maybe if we started mining for solar in earnest 10-15 years ago, but we didn't.\n\nThat's also not even touching climate change ecological impacts, food distruption impacts from both climate change and loss of topsoil, geopolitical conflicts from the above plus water due to the above, extinction crisis, etc. We're just facing down the loaded barrel of about 12 existential threats, ignoring them all, thinking they will just all go away, and accelerating our impact on them.\n\nOur entire economy is tied to energy, and the energy party is less than a decade from being over, and we no longer have the time to do what we needed to start doing 2 decades ago.\n\nFor anyone who wants more info on all these, check out my post history where you can find my youtube channel. Also check out the great simplification which is a terrific science based podcast on what we are facing.",

It might be slightly more expensive or less convenient but we can manage that as well.  We have been able to do it for decades if we needed to, and our abilities aren\u2019t going backwards.  \n\nOur problem has always been political and cultural - we either prioritize things like trillion dollar wars or don\u2019t allow nuclear power plants to be built.  Those are artificial barriers and once the bubble of comfort that we are used to is threatened or popped it will be amazing how fast we kick into gear and make things happen.",

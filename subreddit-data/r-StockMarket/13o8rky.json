            "comment": "Despite the market being what it is, there are still plenty of intrinsically valuable stocks out there that have some great potential. \n\nThis is a classic Graham/Buffet Value Investing approach, so let's get into it:\n\n**Column K: Debt to Equity Ratio** \n\nTotal Liabilities/Total Shareholders Equity\n\nIdeally below 1, absolutely below 2 (depends on sector, banks are an exception as deposits are liabilities)\n\n**Column L: Price to Book Ratio**\n\nPretty straightforward. Market Cap/Shareholder's Equity. Ideally less than 1, certainly less than 1.5\n\n**Column Q: Average Annual Earnings Per Share, Previous 3 years**\n\n**Column R: Stock Price/Column Q**\n\nShould be less than 15. Higher the number, the less that share earns compared to what you pay for it\n\n**Column S: Column L x Column R**\n\nMultiplying the highest tolerable P/B (1.5) by highest tolerable P/E (15). Just a way to couple them together. This number being less than 22.5 can excuse a P/E over 15 or P/B over 1.5\n\n**Target Price**\n\nTake columns L, R, and S, solve for Price, take the average of the 3. That's the average price when P/B = 1.5, P/E = 15, and the multiple = 22.5 (i.e. when a stock goes from undervalued to overvalued)\n\n**Margin**\n\nPercent difference between current and target price. Anything above 50% is strong buy, 25-50% is weak buy, -10 to +25% is hold (maybe look for some LEAPS), and less than -25% is strong sell. \n\nI do have some sells and strong sells in there because I like the companies and have made money on them before, but now they're so overpriced.\n\nTL/DR: a little fun doing fundamental analysis, sharing my picks. Enjoy and discuss!",

We have just gone through an unprecedented decade of money printing and interest rate suppression, which has a direct impact on stocks. Why would you hold through such an obvious and predictable bubble popping? It could take decades for the stock market to recover and it could well be after your lifetime. Buy and hold doesn\u2019t work when the markets and money are artificially manipulated by the government.",

Do you think demand will fall off a cliff or what exactly would turn this into a recessionary force?\n\n&gt;high inflation\n\nI believe the worry here is stagnation, not recession, but if you believe it is recessionary, how?\n\n&gt;impending war with China and Russia\n\nThis is not likely to be a hot war, it also look like China has pulled back from any rash decision based on what Russia is going through. China very well could use supply chains as an attack vector, but in the long run this will push people to look away from China, and I think they know they need to play ball with the rest of the world otherwise their debt's will collapse them. Russia is a loose cannon and who knows how their warmongering will go. These are more wildcards than anything in my book.\n\n&gt;highest debt on record across the board\n\nIt has actually been getting paid off a bit recently, but it really doesn't matter as the US controls the world currency. We cannot default and could borrow a significant amount more from where we are and be just fine. This is why the USD continuing to be the world currency is very important for the well-being of the United States. The USD is also getting quite a bit stronger when compared to other currencies these days.\n\n&gt;COVID, trillions in government spending\n\nThis one is kind of repetitive/redundant, see above. One thing I will add, the government spending on infrastructure will help with all these issues and is likely to increase US production capabilities, not deter from it.\n\n&gt;Major companies are about to close shop or cut back significantly. \n\nThere are the loud folks like Elon Musk saying this kind of thing, but the reality is most companies are still hiring and in need of many more people. There are about 2 jobs for every person looking for work. In an ideal situation, we want these job openings to be cut back to help tackle inflation/fight wage-price spiral\n\nPlease enlighten me on where you land on any of this. I would love to know your take, as for me I just don't see it, at worst maybe a small recession could happen if the Fed goes too far, but that doesn't seem likely either with how cautious and methodical they're moving.",

The fact that you didn't relate the way the Fed fighting inflation with the impending housing crisis is already very weird.\n\nI will try to answer one since other still not completely confirmed yet so it can be said to be not objective if I answer the other ones. \n\nThe recession might happen this Q2, and there are high chance it will happen on Q3. You can check link below that growth of GDP estimate already at 0% for this Q2 and it supposed to be very accurate and this is when rate was so low. If we are still above 0% then very likely Q3 would be below 0% especially with rising interest rate and high inflation. \n\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow",

From my view the housing issue is a lack of inventory and I do not see how this causes a crash, feel free to explain as I would love to hear your views on it. \n\nThe thing is we have a lot of foam on top and the Fed is doing what they are supposed to by taking it down to reality.  They are slowing growth and causing it to go sideways, not a significant decline like people are suggesting. It is important to keep things in perspective as well, and we are just finally back to pre-pandemic fed rates, which are still very very low rates. \n\nIt seems like the suggestion most people have for the cause of recession is that inflation will cause a decline. I think inflation will be with us until late 24 - early 25 and then be pretty close to normal again (maybe closer to 3% instead of 2% tho). It is a complex issue and each sector has their own inflationary pressures, but this will be when chips start getting produced at higher rates and should bring down things such as vehicles, machinery, ect. This will be alongside infrastructure improvements which are already well in the works which will only make supply chains more efficient and thusly lower costs further. \n\nTo put a pin on it, I am not denying the chance for a small recession, I just think most folks are way overblown on the degree it will be. I think if there is one, we are probably a good bit through it already. Feel free to respond how you will, I like to hear differing opinions because everybody has bias and I am definitely not immune.",

The scenario I thought of (which not necessary true) was the Fed policy made people race to buy houses especially using mortgage with low interest rate.

Now they will raise rate to fight inflation that in turn will raise the interest for the mortgage while a lot people would be layoff  or wage couldn't keep up with the increase of interest that they need to pay (keep in mind expend is also increasing because of inflation). This in turn would result in a lot of foreclosures. \n\nOf course, if the one who monopolize the housing are companies it would be a different story since there was news of blackrock buying homes (which actually unethical and US should have done exponential taxes for owning multiple properties to avoid monopoly).\n\nAnyway that's are just what if condition, we could only know further if the mortgage delinquency is increasing and as I said the data has not shown enough definitive signal.",

It'll cause large movements, Add the large short position in just about every stock that also adds buy pressure, the initial rebound will make many miss large part of the sales. That'll cause fomo back in.\n\nHowever if they do it too early we will probably see dead cats as the macroeconomy outlook still looks like its not about to peak.\n\nI'd argue however that its a pretty good time to atleast begin dcaing and building a position into some stocks",

I lost a bunch of people a lot of money, and they're after me.\n\nIn 2021 my posts would get thousands of upvotes and would regularly appear in /r/all . There were many comments like 'I love [my user name] posts!' and 'Time to open up my wallet'.\n\nIn Jan things were starting to look down. I told them fear not , by June the market will be up 30-40%. They trusted me.\n\nIn Feb, things were down even more. I promised them things are going back up, and in fact for every 100 points the S and P 500 drops, I'll lower my pants 1 cm. If my pants gets low enough, I'll have to register as a sex offender for indecent exposure.\n\nWell, it kept lowering and lowering. Soon, I needed to shave off my pubes, and only hangout at beaches. Eventually, I was 1 cm away from showing shaft.\n\nThat's when I imagined my life as a sex offender, panicked, and bailed out of the pledge.\n\nPeople were UPSET. A riot broke out in my announcement post. I got so upset I deleted my whole wallstreetbets post history.\n\nBut they still remembered by user name and tracked me down. Under random comments I get replies like 'WHEN ARE YOU GOINT TO SHOW SHAFT? HUH? HUH?!?'\n\nIt was so bad, I considered sending a report to the reddit admins to end the bullying. I had the message all typed out and everything but before I hit 'send' I decided no, I'm not a coward.\n\nIf I can convince them to give me one more chance, and make them all their money back, all will be right.\n\nI did a ton of research, and figured out that the best and fastest way is to go all in on bitcoin.\n\nI just woke up this morning and it tanked to 21k\n\nI logged onto the account I use for wallstreetbets and saw it has thousands of inbox replies and immediately logged out.\n\nI'm fucked.",

They are too afraid, because this is all the money that they have. They can't buy, because they are out of money.\n\nThis patronizing is just weird. It just ignores the fact that so many people, don't really have too much disposable money to invest for the long term. The money that they can afford to invest, is the money that they need in next 1-2 years.\n\nWhen the need hits, they have to sell. These are the people who end up putting money in risky or even crazy assets like penny stocks, meme stocks, ponji shitcoins, and even in lottery tickets because they don't have the liberty to invest their money and forget about it for few years. They are desperate, because they are poor.\n\nI am fortunate enough to be able to buy aggressively with a market crash, because even if I see 40% loss on my portfolio, I know it's notional, because upto a reasonable level of risk, I will not need that money for next many years.\n\nBut let's not pretend everyone has that choice. Pay people better than what they are being paid so that they don't have to live paycheck to paycheck, instead of making it look like, they are making these bad choices intentionally.",

Bought a long term call on AMD and crashed even though I bought it well and the time value halved.  GDP contraction during an inflationary spike doesn't equal inflation control, it induces a recession.  Wait until prices start to drop and everyone goes back to the store and takes back the stuff they just bought on sale.  Record inventory everywhere.  Wish I'd bought SQQQ when it was around 12 not too long ago.  Even our currency stopped the gain after the rate hike and is correcting.  Oh here's more interest buy our wreckord otay, I'm Buhweet.\n\nEven money is losing money as it's losing local value.

However why are there a lack of buyers? Because of the fear generated by all the talking heads on financial news. Then comes the selling from weak hands putting additional pressure. And hedge funds are running out of room to stash their profits from shorting the market. It's a shame because even though some stocks were overpriced, a lot were not and all are being punished. You can say it's over done and be right and buy the dip until you run out of money, once the tidal wave of fear selling has started there's nothing you can or should do until the wave is passed and the general feeling is numbness. Then you buy.",

Usually first one is screening with an in house recruiter, second one is with the manager, and last one is with the manager + director of the department for a mock phone call. All it takes is a small amount of social competency. Turnover is so unbelievably high for these type of sales roles too so that definitely plays a part into why they're not cut loose super quickly, I think it has a lot to do with sunk-cost fallacy after spending a month ramping up and training a new employee that they will give them at least a few months of runway before really cracking down on them.",

The 2008 crisis (pay attention to the term, it wasn't a recession, it was a crisis) wasn't predicted by fed, and I guess this is true for every crisis (not recession) in the whole US history",

A rate hike pause will just test the spending sentiment and concrete current consumer prices as bottom, which allows room for price hikes... if inflation surges on a pause, then we're screwed. In my opinion, we're just compressing the spring instead of breaking it. Wages will never catch up to inflation and these rates are never going down.

Personally, in our current situation, I lean towards the former. The personal savings rate in April was 4.1% which is well over half of the rate we were seeing prior to the pandemic (roughly 8.5 - 9%), plus we saw a fairly significant drop from the 4.5% reading in March.",

Core CPI has been around for decades, so I'm not sure what you're talking about with this whole \"narrative\" thing.\n\n\n2. It's reported right next to the headline number, so IDK what you mean by \"actual\" CPI number\n\n\n3. Gas is included in headline CPI and is the main reason it's down from the 9.1% peak. It's not included in Core but housing is. Do you even know what you're criticising here?",

If I were in his shoes, I would still hike to try and push stubborn inflation lower and I would jump it more than expected. If he only raises rates slightly it will not have the dramatic effect necessary to get it to 2%. What will happen with a slight raise is that Saudi/OPEC will lower production again to try and keep that stubborn core inflation around. This is a game of chess we are watching play out with moves and counter moves.",

Food costs are slowing down month over month but if you take the 3 months as a proxy, we should be around target next year. So apparently, energy didn\u2019t cause food prices to skyrocket\n\nThe problem is in core excluding food and energy, is around 5.3% YoY and was 5.5% last year around the same time, so it is not really slowing down.\n\nIf you combine all items minus Energy, I think YoY should be around 5.8% relative to 6-6.5% last year.\n\nOne of the biggest myths around is that shelter is cooling down because its lagging and yet its coming at 8% YoY vs 5.8% last year. Shelter is below peak last year, but by no mean cooling down or flat\n\nYou can make from the data whatever you want, but inflation not going down, its just sticky relative to last year. Literally core been flat for 3 months around 5%, if you go back to 2019, which is a good proxy, it was ranging between 2.2 and 2, which is the Feds target\n\n\nAlso a random rant, medical services is not on decline. I have no clue how the read is coming on negative for physicians and hospitals or flat to PY.\n\nservices are definitely going as up as commodities (prescriptions).  I would love meet any human being who is paying for medical services this year as much as last year or the same. Also, airlines fares (3)%?  Yeah if you play Spirit",

There's certain analysts who originally said you could only read core since it was stable, and now those same people are championing reductions in headline. Same people switch from YoY to MoM and vice versa when its convenient, or cite a supposed lag in housing disinflation (citing Zillow, not CPI) while never mentioning the lag on the way up. \n\nGreat genuine post man.

Headline CPI, which includes food, is up 18-19%. \n\nAlso, do you know that you can [review the weights](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm#RIData) for the CPI calculations?\n\nThe BLS weights [shelter as 34% of the total CPI basket](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2022.xlsx).\n\nSo 34% of the headline CPI basket has increased 24% since 2020. That doesn't seem at all out of whack for a top-line number of 18-19%.",

In Reddit seems that there are no more posts about the profits made by buying the index, I mean there are a lot of traders who are not inside the market.  Well seems that just less than 5% of traders are making money in the market. In December year over year CPI chart was changing direction, now inflation has decreased a lot and the stock market is in the moon. Everyone should be very happy and everyone should have a portfolio with a huge amount of profits, but seems that a few made it. The problem is that in any corner there are bad news, pessimistic points of view about what is going to happen. There are a lot of people who is spending more money, getting more debt. I did not invest because the news, the economic projection, etc make me feel that if I put money in the market, the market will sink down again, that was my worse decision since the beginning of this year. My mind was brainwashed with a lot of garbage by news, economic indicators, insiders, etc, etc. I should have learn technical analysis and avoid reacting to the news and everyone who is saying that the stock market will go down. The recession until now has never arrived!",

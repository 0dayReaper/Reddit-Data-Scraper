I know it\u2019s maybe a tad aggressive and very tech focused but at my age I believe that\u2019s maybe a good thing. Happy to hear others thoughts though. Also, Argo was a disaster I know. Luckily only went in small. TIA.",

I actually trimmed my MSFT which I regret now but felt it was too large relative to the portfolio. I am planning on adding more to ETFs now while just keep a close eye on the stocks. Hoping I outperform of course but time will tell",

Currently no stop losses set, may review this in order to catch reversals but don't want to be too tradey. I generally just invest what I save each month, anywhere from 500-1500 usually. I need to sit down and decide a minimum each month and commit to that. I like the thought on the 4 adds, some necessities to balance out my tech. I did used to have national grid but sold at 50% profit and was a good call. Will maybe add XLU or similar and REIT. Thanks!",

I\u2019m saying there is no way for them to know.  \n\nThey didn\u2019t make decisions last month for June and Julys interest rate hikes because the data is not available yet.  Just because they hinted at slowing down doesn\u2019t mean they are going to stop hiking.  We have a habit as humans of being over predictive because it is settling.\n\nMy whole point behind the original reply is they didn\u2019t say they were going to stop hiking, if anything the jobs reports suggest they are going to hike at least one more time, but it would be foolish of us to try and predict that.",

Of course, crushing the economy would kill that, and that appears to be what the Fed is going to do, but at the same time how can they maintain 2% unemployment (give or take a little)? It's impossible to crush the economy without U rising to 5, 9, 13% and the Fed then would have to bring interest rates down to cure that problem they made.\n\nThis is not a good sequence and the law driving the Fed probably has to change to improve things.",

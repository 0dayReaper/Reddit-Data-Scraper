A growing company should be spending money and taking on debt. Instead, they've just made huge cuts. Their sales and revenue have absolutely crashed. They are pulling out of most European countries and closing shops in the USA too. They haven't invested properly in e commerce. Their NFT market is very poor and has declined so much that they never bother mentioning it at earnings. They've fired most of the Devs. \n\nI really don't see any vision or roadmap for them to grow. They've got a dying business model based on physical game copies. It's not a growth model unless you actually spend money to grow, which they haven't yet.",

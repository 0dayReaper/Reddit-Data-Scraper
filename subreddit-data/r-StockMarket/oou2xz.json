Especially since Amazon has squeezed margins and put competition out of business. Because of the high stock price they were able to find years of losses until competition started falling apart. Now they offer companies a platform to sell on but Amazon gains all of the customers, Amazon gets the CRM data. Amazon learns what sells and then cuts out the middleman. Cool they employ a lot of people but how many did they put out of business in the process? How much have they abused privacy with opt out features on their smart speakers. Cool, you saved 5% on your toilet paper but nobody understand the real cost to society.",

Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft).   \n\n2. Reduced the total carbon foot print of the US. It\u2019s a lot cheaper for people to order online rather than drive a 2-ton vehicle across the earth everytime they need to buy a carton of milk or a fleshlight.   \n\n3. Has given people a lot of their time back that they would\u2019ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.   \nSpends 1 billion every year to help advance space travel via Blue Origin.   \n\n4. Has employed over 2 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $15.  \nYeah he has 150bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \\~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon\u2019s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars).  \n\n\nLastly, the federal government has a budget of 4 trillion dollars per YEAR. If we forced Amazon\u2019s founder to redistribute his wealth it would be enough to run the country for 2 weeks at best. Overall him accumulating \\~180 bn over a lifetime is a very small price to pay for the value Amazon and potentially Blue Origin has provided and will provide in the future.",

He hasn\u2019t even made an effort to seem like he cares about his employees, let alone actually look after them.\n\nI\u2019m glad people are going to space, I think it\u2019s giving future generations something to strive for and benefits science and humanity at large, and will likely lead a lot more people into pursuing STEM careers, but that doesn\u2019t mean these people are necessarily role models that deserve un-checked admiration.",

I don't mean that its superior in delivery either. For instance there was a company that made tripods very efficiently and because of the way online shopping is, the only way they could realistically sell their product was through the Amazon Marketplace. Amazon let them sell products through the marketplace until they made a tripod based entirely on its design, then manipulated the market place to showing their product first and shoving the old product to the bottom of the list, so nobody saw it. Bam, Amazon sells their tripods and the other company is out of business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also are famous for hostile takeovers, they buy up a bunch of a company, not enough to do much but look at how they work intrinsically and then replicate that and put the up and comer out of business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Amazons big moneymaker is their webservice, AWS. You actually can't really use the internet without using them, and further, when you search for a product there's no way amazon's store doesn't come up first, because they control the distribution of information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also sell a ton of fake products, with no consequence. counterfeit, broken, or misleading items are sold there in a way that would put other businesses under, but because they aren't really a store (somehow) they don't need to regulate their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmazon is proof that with enough money, you don't actually need to compete, you can just buy your way to success. Its important to remember amazon wasn't the first or best company to do the things that made it successful, it merely survived the Dot Com crash, and by being one of the few companies that wasn't panic sold into extinction, it just cornered a market it didn't really have before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd on top of ALL OF THAT, Bezos isn't the one making these day to day decisions other that saying \"make me a streaming service\" or \"I want to be a video game company too\" and then others make it happen. Bezos highlights a problem we've been having since our anti-trust laws have been destroyed. (in the past, an online store would also not be able to control how people shop for items because that would get too close to a monopoly, but because of chipping away at these laws, amazon has been able to increase its foothold into every market by not even allowing competition to grow)",

He's literally called an asshole by many notable heroes several times in the movies.\n\nJeff Bezos is an asshole, but he's unfortunately not a fictional character. I'm not going to applaud his stunt to visit space any more than Elon's to shoot a car up there.\n\nYes, a side effect of their egos may be positive in the same way our space race with Russia was... But don't ask me to applaud the cold War. Jeff doesn't deserve an ounce of acclaim, the people working for him do. He didn't send his best workers into space, though... He sent himself.",

To me (not knowing any better, having not watched the show in years, and giving zero fucks about cryptocurrency) it makes whoever wrote the title look really pathetic. I'm not saying they ARE pathetic, just that this is how they look to unknowledgeable outsiders.\n\nEdit: Having now read the article, it - the article - is not worth anybody's time to read. \n\n&gt; At this point, it is unclear what led to the Dogecoin sell-off following Elon Musk's appearance on SNL. According to CNN, perhaps investors want the Tesla boss to say something more motivating for the digital currency. \n\nSo the two things may not even be related, and the whole thing is click bait for some lucky article author.",

Other features will be added regularly.\nWe're rolling out the beta experience to all iOS users over a 6-week period beginning April 28, 2021. We're starting with customers who don't trade on margin, trade options, or do extended-hours trading (all classic app features will still be available and users can seamlessly navigate between beta and classic anytime).\nTo be added, keep your Fidelity Mobile\u00ae app updated and look for an opt-in button in the More menu. An Android version is coming this summer.\u201d",

When no one is buying and every stop loss, leveraged long, and bot needs to sell to exit positions at the exact same time. By the time you click the sell button on the screen you're last in line for selling.  On any platform. \n\nYou can blame the platform and the same shit will happen to you next time or you can try to learn from this.\n\nEdit: I know some ppl may say but RH was down so that's why I couldn't even get my sell in. From my experience with the same on other platforms like Coinbase you may get your your sell order in during a dump but it may only go through minutes or hours later once the sells before you are processed and by the time the price may be shockingly low and you won't be able to retract your sell. I've learned from my mistakes and  sharing, now am quite happy HODLing until I use my crypto as crypto.",

Seriously, go calculate how much yields would have to increase from here in order for the 10 year treasury to decline 25%. \n\nAnd since the debt ceiling thing is expected to be a short term phenomenon, long term fixed income should be less volatile than short term fixed income. Rotating out of equities and into long term treasuries is a reasonable way to hedge until this blows over. \n\nIf you honestly believe that the US government will default on a 10 year loan in the next 6 months, then that means that the financial system is screwed. In that scenario, it won\u2019t matter what assets you\u2019re in because they\u2019ll all likely be worthless.",

If you stop paying your debts, people won't see you as a reliable borrower and your costs to borrow will be higher. It's oversimplified, but the effect is the same. Just with more zeroes",

I would get the WSJ daily e-mails about 10 topics (usually the same 10 in all three e-mails, every day)  The only relevant bit of news I would say I used out of those newsletters were the stocks reporting earnings that day.  Barron's is just advertising mixed with opinion pieces.  The WSJ page itself does not set itself apart from any other major news outlet.  And again, opinion mixed with advertising.  I just don't find value from it.\n\nI've replaced the WSJ with 1440 newsletter.  Still deciding if it's worth it.  Same with [https://ground.news](https://ground.news) and [justthenews.com](https://justthenews.com) \n\nI also like [https://www.youtube.com/@NobodySpecialFinance](https://www.youtube.com/@NobodySpecialFinance)\n\nJust baby steps but I don't see much value in traditional news outlets currently.",

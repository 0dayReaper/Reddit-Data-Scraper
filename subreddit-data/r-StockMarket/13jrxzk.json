One, bc I care as much about celebrities as the care about me. Two, she would put Michael Jackson to shame with her number of plastic surgeries. \n\nAlso, this sub sucks. Few and far in between the memes meant to discourage and denigrate household investors are there actually anything with substance about the markets.",

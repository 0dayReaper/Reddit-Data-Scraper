    "postText": "Hi guys. So earlier today I sold AMD. Im new to investing and regret my decision. I was at work and let the emotions get the best of me. I did make profit. Right now I have 1k to invest. Any advice on where to put it, where I can expect a decent return in less than a year? Right now I have 40 shares in ford, 2.5 in Crisp, and 2 in COP which I\u2019m not feeling to confident that everything won\u2019t go well. (I could be wrong)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m constantly monitoring the market and news to see what\u2019s going on but obviously I miss things. I would love everyone\u2019s input.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t invest until you have exactly 25k, I\u2019m just saying focus more on getting to 25k not from investing but from working and adding to the portfolio. Not alot of people can invest 1k and make 25k off that investment. Almost anyone with a decent job can save 25k with in a few years if not more.",

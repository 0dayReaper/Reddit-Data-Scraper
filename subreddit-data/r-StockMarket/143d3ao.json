It all comes down to a the simple question whether you believe that future performance of a stock is somehow embedded or encoded in it's past movements. TA is highly subjective and hampered by personal biases and cognitive fallacies. Also, there is no broad scientific evidence or consent that supports the effectiveness of TA.",

A pullback to the 222 area would be a potential spot to add.\n\nThat said, market is very extended here and due for a pullback, so TSLA might have to wait. Gravity may win in the short-term.",

Now they are great cars but with bigger companies tossing their hats in the ring weither or not Tesla has a good car people back what people know. With GM, Ford, now Dodge having their own EV's on the market or heading to the market you'll be damn sure to see more people driving those. Tesla was hyped and the market cap was pushed due to the lack of other \"good\" options but with bigger names in the bunch they arent the top dog in EV's. Never to be forgotten though, I feel they have a place in garage's around the world but there's other options that meet Tesla's standards.",

I see more Mach E Mustangs than I do Tesla's at least in my area, not to mention how many Tesla's you see being traded in for a gas cars. All I'm saying is within a matter of a few years big name companies have changed paths from never going EV to now pushing for a full fleet of EV's. Tesla has had a good run on there own without compeitors but in a game that most car companies have been playing since they began? It's all about pushing out the next top model thats better than the rest and Tesla's EV truck looks like a dumbster on wheels and hasn't hit the market yet, and now we see Ford a company mainly known for its Trucks has an EV Truck Tesla is sure to be left behind unless they up the game and push models out and redesign. People will get bored of the same old interior the same old look and body lines that's what drive new sales in cars. Ford, GM, and Dodge have an edge over Tesla as the way I see it beyond the look of the cars they live to kill the competition.",

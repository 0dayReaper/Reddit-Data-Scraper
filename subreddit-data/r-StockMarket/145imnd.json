    "postText": "In pioneering a transformative approach to lithium extraction from oil field brines, Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF) achieved a ground-breaking milestone in commercial lithium extraction from oilfield brines through its innovative IES-300 DLE technology, showcasing unprecedented success during its pilot project and demonstrating the commercial viability of its innovative IES-300 DLE technology.\n\nOperating within a simulated commercial environment, VLT demonstrated the capability to achieve remarkable lithium recoveries of 90% from concentrations as low as 34 mg/L as well as 97% recoveries using 120 mg/L concentrations while maintaining operating costs below CAD$4,000 per tonne.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6ugflvfh25b1.png?width=1984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3922219634867cc6d95828816a95aa6440017aec\n\nA noteworthy achievement was proving that VLT's DLE technology can maintain 90% lithium recoveries in concentrations as low as 34 mg/L while still maintaining commercial economics. This is an achievement yet to be reported by other producers and has the potential to revolutionize the lithium extraction industry. Plus, this positions VLT to produce commercially from any major oilfield in North America that has \\~50mg/L lithium. \n\nWith this, VLT is poised to lead the way in North America as the first commercial producer of lithium from oilfield brines. VLT is set to achieve this milestone at its Rainbow Lake Property in the second half of 2024, following the release of its PEA later this summer. \n\nThe recent release of an initial resource report at Rainbow Lake further adds to VLT's momentum, revealing a substantial lithium resource of 4.3 million tonnes with concentrations reaching up to 121mg/L. These findings lay a solid foundation for VLT to progress toward its PEA as the company prepares to advance its operations and capitalize on this abundant resource.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdfajyunh25b1.png?width=1750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a6ebbe225d9bf96f0d87475030023211adcd6a0\n\nFor further insight into the significance of VLT's pilot project results, check out this Emerging Market Report for an in-depth analysis: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/06/2682681/0/en/Emerging-Markets-Report-A-Revolution-Inside-a-Revolution.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/06/2682681/0/en/Emerging-Markets-Report-A-Revolution-Inside-a-Revolution.html)\n\nPosted on behalf of Volt Lithium Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

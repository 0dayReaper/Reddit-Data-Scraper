    "postText": "Today, a broad decline in technology stocks led U.S. stocks lower, while U.S. Treasuries fell after the Bank of Canada unexpectedly raised interest rates, fueling bets that Federal Reserve tightening is not over. The tech-dominated Nasdaq fell more than 1%, after large tech companies had pushed the S&amp;P 500 to the edge of the bull market before today's pullback. Policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields rose more than 8 basis points to 4.56% as traders increased bets on a 25 basis point U.S. rate hike in July. Sigma, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the market is still widely expected to raise interest rates for a longer period of time in order to fight inflation, which is bound to put pressure on technology stocks. The Fed and the ECB will make decisions next week, with the Fed hinting it may skip a rate hike in June before resuming it later.",

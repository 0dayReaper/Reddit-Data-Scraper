Get the same vibes today as back then. Bull market or not, small cap underperformed the main index for a while now, just like in 2000. If you pick sound and solid small cap companies, they will most likely outperform the market just because they are underlooked because they dont have anything to do with AI.",

While CNN gets more traffic (thus, sells more advertising) from the title of this indicator, it SHOULD be called \u201cThe Bull and Bear Index\u201d.\n\nMeaning\u2026.  This index tracks the MOMENTUM of the overall market.   When the indicator is on \u201cFear\u201d it means that the stock market is experiencing positive momentum (prices rising above moving avg, volatility dropping, breadth improving, call buying, \u201cjunk bond\u201d buying).\n\nRight now the market is \u201cbullish\u201d for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAfter experiencing a 20% down year last year, and seeing incredible levels of pessimism in the market in January/February, the fact we have positive momentum is, amazing.\n\n\nIf a train pulled out of a station, would you use the speedometer to decide when you applied the brakes?  Or would you look out the front window??",

Index funds periodically rebalance to add winners and losers without you needing to analyze individual companies. \n\nThat said, my single stock pick gamble at the moment is 140 shares of GOOGL and that comprises 5% of my total portfolio. I like to gamble with maximum of 5% at any given time. \n\nThe rest of my stock exposure comes primarily from S&amp;P 500 (FXAIX), Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), total international stock index (VXUS).",

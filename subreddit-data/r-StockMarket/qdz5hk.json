Your stock could go up to 150 and nothing happens, but if it drops all the way down to 80 then it will automatically sell your shares at 90$ so you only lose that 10$ per share.  \n\nA TRAILING stop loss (anyone correct me if I'm wrong) but is the same thing, but when your stock would go up to 150$ your stop loss also goes up to say 140$ because its 10$ under the current price. \n\nSo if the price then drops to 80$ then it will auto-sell your shares at 140$ instead of 90$ like the first scenario since it's a TRAILING stop-loss and not just a regular one.",

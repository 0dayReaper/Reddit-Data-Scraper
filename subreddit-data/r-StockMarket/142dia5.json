    "postText": "Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company\u2019s share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?\n\nOne bright spot has been the company\u2019s increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian\u2019s future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring.\u00a0\n\nHowever, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn\u2019t establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market.\u00a0\n\nI believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.",

Simultaneously the EV market by now has way more players, including the ones who have been making cars for a 100 years. The low hanging fruit are gone, and despite what Tesla told people, they're not in software they're in automotive. Looking at any kind of lists of who sells most EVs, I don't see Rivian on them.\n\nBut you know, you never know..? Something for that risky part of your portfolio? In any case, I think that's why the momentum is gone at the moment.",

The fact they were briefly valued about 100x their actual value by the market at one point isn't Rivian's fault.  If their run rate continues at only the same amount of sakes as their most recent quarter, they are trading at about 5.3 times their sales.\n\nTheir profitability may be held back by accounting tricks rather than actual cash burn... How much is depreciation annually on new factories, btw?  How much are they paying in stock options that count against the balance sheet but don't actually cost money?  \n\nI haven't researched them, but they are finally making progress.  Rivian's market cap may not be particularly overheated at this point.\n\nI saw one in Syracuse NY yesterday, my first sighting of a Rivian vehicle other than their website. Syracuse is not a hotbed of electric vehicles.\n\nTheir sales are 2.9% of Tesla's, their market cap is 1.9% of Tesla's... Other than Tesla fanboys buying stock because reasons, why is Tesla's valuation so much higher? If they correct and meet in the middle, Rivian will be worth 25% more than it's worth right now, with no material improvement in execution.  Rivian seems to be headed in the right direction.\n\nI'm thinking about buying in...",

They're trying to scare investors into selling before interest rates start getting cut and they go into a deeper hole they have no way of getting out of. When in doubt go long if you wrong you can hold till market recovers. Go short and you better be right about another crash coming or you're fucked. There no crashing coming imo, some ppl made bad choices now they're praying for one to save them\n\nYou just need to look at how the market reacted to rate cuts in the middle of a pandemic and complete economical shut down  to realize if it cares more about rates or economy. It's all about rates especially when economy is doing well as it is",

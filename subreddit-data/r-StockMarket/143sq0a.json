But those networks would only have dozens of nodes, vs the hundreds of thousands or more they have now, making them not very powerful.\n\nThe AI we saw in the 80's was completely different, and were really just very sophisticated if/then trees and pre-computed data.  This is the type of AI behind deep blue.\n**edit**: This type of AI is known as an \"Expert System\".\n\nThe 80's to early 90's also saw renewed interest in neural network type AI, but computing power still wasn't sufficient for doing anything \"intelligent\".  This era did lead to a lot of advancements in machine vision and I think bill readers in vending machines still use very small neural networks to recognize bill's.\n\nThis brings us to now, the third generation of  neural network style AI.  There will probably need to be a 4th and 5th generation before anything like actual intelligence arises.",

Earnings multiples are so stretched that there's NO WHERE to grow in the tech world. It's another SPAC bubble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecall that since the 80s/90s it took 14 years to get your money back in the crash of 2000. If you expect the Tech sector to continue as it did in the past with the \"communication spin-off craze\" then this is the top and it'll die on the AI hill.",

It chops its text up into fixed length tokens, usually partial words and often including spaces, symbols, and punctuation.\n\nBut, from an investment point of view, this technology has reached a point where it is clearly going to be disruptive, massively so for some business.  Missing out is a risk.\n\nGenerative AI is already replacing writers and artists and it will only get more capable and replace more jobs.  AI's impact on search in general, and of course Google in particular, will also be huge.  Google has been trying to be more of an answer engine vs a search engine for a long time.  AI presents opportunities for both Google and their competitors.\n\nI also think you have the shareholder relationship backwards here.  If talking about AI makes your share price go up, that's pressure *from* investors on the company to focus more on AI.  And for the most part, I don't think companies are lying about AI, just being \"very optimistic\" in the way they always are about new technology investments.",

Some people are better at identifying what patterns they have previously seen apply best to what they are currently doing.\n\nComputers follow instructions, what is currently being described as AI is mostly just better instructions ran on a better computer pulling data from a larger data set expressed in a better way.\n\nIf the instructions tell a computer to detect patterns it can do that quite well. It will only interpret the patterns as we instructed it to.",

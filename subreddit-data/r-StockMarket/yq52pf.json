Can't have stock go up in a company that doesn't have stock. Also , yes, there is a reason why social media doesn't do what claims he will. They can't. *if* he allowed free speech then advertisers would flee. But he won't. He already banned a comedian for making fun of him. You accidentally agreed with me though when you said it would make millions. He paid 44 billion for it. You need a lot more than millions to make it worth it.",

If you are serious about what you wrote you might want to reread it. Your argument is simplistic at best, roads are needed even in places where the infrastructure isn't solely focussed on cars. \nIf not for cars, then for bikes or other means of transport to at the very least bridge the gap to places like train stations. \n\nNot to mention that we needed roads before cars were a thing. So, just to make it work in your head, replace \"roads\" for \"infrastructure\" and you are good to go. It doesn't matter if you are talking about roads, tram tracks, train tracks, etc all of it needs to be paid for. Heck, even dirt roads need to be maintained to some degree for you and your horse carriage to be able to travel. \n\nThat's why it was just an example, a perfectly fine example for everyone who is able to see it as that and expand on the context.",

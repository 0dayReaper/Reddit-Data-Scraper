They keep building though.\n\n\"It comes from a different budget.\" Then why are you slicing everything else to cover new interest rates and to maintain profit margins to entice bond purchases to help fund these projects? \n\nHealthcare construction is booming, but a lot of hospitals are screwing their workers to keep the projects rolling. They refuse to look at the post-covid economic reality and adjust their push for expansion. We're going to see more people leaving healthcare as conditions get worse. Another subsection will switch to traveling positions if possible because of the better pay and freedom. That in turn will drive up cost in a market that is already short staffed presently.",

When your several million homes short it makes it difficult for prices to come down. Especially when the cost of labor and materials are so high for new construction. \n\nThe really troubling thing IMO longer term for housing is that while the fed is busy patting itself on the back for slowing the housing market, the rates being this high curbs new construction. Which long term is what we badly, badly need to keep prices from continuing to rise over the next 10 years. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest things that bothers me about the stance the fed has taken. Short term, it\u2019s great. Longer term I\u2019m afraid we are going to look back on it and not view it as quite as much of a win. \n\nWe badly, badly need inflation to continue to fall and for the fed to get to a point it can start cutting rates. I can\u2019t let myself think about it too much because it makes me angry how much of this mess was created by the fed ignoring inflation and the lockdowns destroying supply chains. We did so much during the pandemic that was just so dumb.",

The market has been pinned or trading in a range as everyone has bought PUTS or downside protection do to fear of a market crash.  If there was a crash all these folks would make millions sell their puts and then buy more stock, but due to hedging on the other side the market doesn't crash.\nSo a watched market doesn't crash. Knowledge is Vol dampening ect ect.\n\nIf you expect housing or stocks to crash you take actions to prepare.  If you take actions so do other people.  These actions have a direct impact on markets.\n\nIn housing people are hoping for a crash or at least lower prices are saving up lots of cash for down payments to scope up deals.  (This was not happening in 2008 as that was due to too much credit not too much cash).  This buildup of cash on the sidelines will dampen the volitility in housing if we ever get an event that causing forced selling \n\nForced selling in housing or stocks is the only thing that causing prices to dramatically decrease.  In stocks it's called margin calls in houses its called foreclosure.  Margin calls are immediate.... foreclosure take a year plus.  \n\nA housing crash or correction if one is going to happen will take much longer than people think.  We could have a recession with no housing crash due to the banking reforms that increased down payments and pretty much got ride of toxic loans.  If you want a crash you wanted people to take out 0 down adjustable rate loans at the top.  Instead we had 20% down at 3% fixed \n\nHousing is in a tough spot.",

You might see lower growth rates - down 2% per year from 6% per year - for example, but not anywhere close to what might feel helpful. \n\nAnother way to think about it might be rents escalated at say 10% per year for 3 years and are expected to soften 5% over the next 12 months. That\u2019s not really relief. \n\nBasically, the MF is softening up a bit. Going from red hot to hot. \n\nI would say that landlords are getting pinched a bit by higher property taxes and higher utility costs and maintenance and repairs.",

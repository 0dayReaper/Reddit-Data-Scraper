It\u2019s so fast it made my head spin. Itll be out in a year, and it\u2019ll be way better, so at some point people will hold off on the current system unless they deeply discount it\u2026 meanwhile their graphics card memory has been dedicated to data centers so they\u2019re kinda limited compared to amd. I guess the new system uses hbm3 so maybe nvidia will go back to 16gb graphics cards.\n\nI just wonder if there will be a lapse of sales between the units, and if the 4000 series will sell slowly until it\u2019s memory is increased?\n\nShould I sell it?",

As more businesses become aware of the ways in which existing open-source LLMs can be utilized in-house for purposes that extend beyond chat and image generation (not to mention the ongoing progress of the capabilities of the thousands of open-source models).... demand for GPUs will continue to increase at an unprecedented rate.\n\nIt seems 90% (at least) of the comments on here indicate surface level knowledge and knee-jerk reactions on the basis of very limited knowledge while hardly ever demonstrating knowledge of the advancements that are going on behind the scenes.",

If it produces any bugs, see if GPT-4 can figure out what they are (but I would suggest fixing them yourself, for the experience). Copilot's good but I think they might be using davinci or GPT-3 or perhaps even codex (which is now deprecated by OpenAI). Take a look at projects like AutoGPT (there's a few others but I forget all their names), which goes beyond coding AIs.\n\nAlso, you should look into vector databases (probably want to use something like pinecone to start), what embedding are, and how to use them. They're very powerful tools. You'll probably also want to take a look at langchain (learn how it actually functions; not just how to use it). Take a look at this [\"langchain-mini\"](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/05/04/langchain-mini.html) blog post; it does a good job of explaining the basics of how these function without having to understand the full langchain codebase, with all its bells and whistles cluttering things up (but if you're going to use one of those; definitely use the one with the bells and whistles). LlamaIndex is also useful in certain situations but don't assume it's necessary. You'll also want to become familiar with the work that's going on at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) and research the recent history and current state of the evolution of the models hosted on there. Oh, you'll also want to learn prompt engineering (not just writing something but understanding stuff like... first example that comes to mind is that you should never use the word \"photorealistic\" when generating an image).\n\nOh, and [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) provides low-to-no-code executable environments for popular local AI models.\n\nBest of luck. Hit me up in DMs (not chat, preferably) if you have questions.\n\nedit: Oh! And look into how the length of the token buffer restricts the amount of context. This is vital and is the main reason for the use of a vector database (beyond simply cutting costs/execution time)... otherwise, you could (theoretically) just toss gigabytes of context into each query. The main skill with building around LLMs is a matter of managing context. In some systems, I use lesser AIs to help me compress and sanitize context data.",

It moves heat to places where you have more room for fans and such. I'd prefer a really powerful fan directly on the GPU over a system of liquid that moves the problem to a different location. In both scenarios, you're ultimately limited by your ability to *dissipate* heat (not transport it).",

They know how to read financial statements and ask questions that allow them to fill in cell B13 on their Excel models - but often the questions they ask suggest they're focusing in the \"wrong\" area, while the answers they're given are so lacking in specificity that even if the question was spot-on, it doesn't inform an insightful answer.  \n\nDo your own research.  And if you're not willing to go deep on any one company, go broad on many - index funds or mutual funds to spread risk.   And if you do invest in singular companies/stocks just be prepared for the inevitable highs and lows that follow as you try to outsmart the market.  \n\nCramer was also hot on Theranos and we all know how that ended.   No-one, not even it's A-list celebrity board members, knew what the heck was going on....",

So in the instance of curing HIV the temporary knockdown of the gene is more beneficial than a deletion as the virus enters cells via the CCR5 Delta 32 receptor. \n\nAlso Novartis is using their propiertry SiRNA for their work in end stage liver disease. So liver transplants likely won't be needed in the future. \n\nNow if you could also modulate response of a gene via a drug through RNA ie dial it up dial it down then it would open up a world of possibility for medications and even life extension... I emailed them they stated they are at 70 to 95 percent knockdown levels so I asked if they could go to 100 percent and the said essentially it is dependant on the requirements and they can go higher. So for me this means they are at 100 or close to 100 percent knockdown. 95 percent knockdown is the difference between a drug that keeps HIV in control and 100 percent knockdown a drug that cures HIV.  I think these are the guys who will get there first. \n\nhttps://www.alnylam.com/",

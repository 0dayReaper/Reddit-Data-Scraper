Yes, selling the top and buying the bottom on either would've been great; but how do you time that? If you've got a decent retirement account set up, you're already likely doing better than the market, without any of the risk of trying to time it.",

Having worked in the startup space how it works is a handful of companies compete building the same product.  Most of the companies are working towards having such a good IP that they will be bought up by a larger company like Apple.  Some of them decide to build and sell their own products and create a new space, like Nest.\n\nThere is always some new tech with some group of companies racing towards the finish line.  What we're seeing in the EV and self driving space is one of those races.\n\nIn comparison, the dot com bubble wasn't a race between companies, it was most companies in the first world saying, \"We need an internet presence.\"  It was a revolution that was large scale.  The dot com bubble was closer to the invention of the telephone than what we're seeing today.",

The biggest issue is you don't really realize where you are in the \"dip\" at any point until it's actually long over.  The market will do fake out rises where 2 days in a row it goes up and we're thinking, \"awesome, that was the bottom, time to buy in..\" nope. Down another 15% the next week. And then another 10% the next week.. It's just about being able to not panic and sell when it's gone down a ton.  I have to look away from the market during these times to not fall into that pit of despair.",

No one was talking about the stock market.  It wasn't hyped up.  I was called crazy for saying there would be a crash.  That's what tops of bubbles are like.  2008 surprised many people, quite a bit more than 2020 did.  Likewise 99 did too.  In 99 there was 20 years of rise.  A lot of people had worked 15-20 years, were 5-10 years away from retirement and had no clue what a recession even was.  They may have heard about it in a history class or their parents talking about it, but it just wasn't a concept.",

But you have to pay the piper with price disconnect when growth finally comes back. \n\nHold onto your shorts, economy and supply chains are gearing up like I\u2019ve not seen in my 13 year working career in middle market banking . Manufacturing pipelines are strong, commodities and other inputs are scarce and prices are rising. It will be a challenging but high growth year, it\u2019s just a matter of how much value the currency allows to be created vs inflated away. We shall see. \n\nI\u2019ve shifted a large portion of my portfolio into large cap value. I may be missing out leaving the NASDAQ and mid/small cap behind but i am ok with that.",

It was because we had too much capital chasing too little opportunities too soon in an environment that the cost of the technology is too high relative to the cost of technology feasibility. The fact that we\u2019re seeing the market broadening out to different sectors outside the tech market suggests that the market not doing what it did back in the day. In fact the market is sane for the such moves because we\u2019re actually seeing commodity prices going up rapidly especially the best economy indicator that we have that is copper. All this means is that we\u2019re actually seeing the market on a great recovery track and is actually on a fire recovery. We also see the same signal from the yield increase in the 2-5 years bond market. The market is leading the FED as we see the rate going up despite FEDs effort to keep it low. This is a very bullish sign for the economy. This money rotation will be a short term flight IMO and ultimately money will be coming back to chase after growth that is what tech offers. At this point, you\u2019ve already missed the opportunity to chase after commodity wave and is actually better off to buy the dip of tech stock and wait for that rebound that will be coming soon.",

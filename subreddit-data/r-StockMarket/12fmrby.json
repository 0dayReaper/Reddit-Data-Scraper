NOT THE CASE!!! The quality you see on the shelf can rarely be matched by at home grows in the garden or garage. Compare it to at home brew kits for beer. Yeah it's a novel idea and a cute project, but if you want the good stuff, you go buy it.  Message me for pics if you wanna see what I do with 30000 square feet.",

I found they stay away with a perimeter spray of vinegar and a few rotten chicken legs near the garden area. A bit of lavender in the vicinity can help to. They won't get near it. Apparently, lavender scent can stick with a deer for quite a while, imparing its ability to smell predators. The chicken legs alert them to food in the area that predators may come in search of... this approach has kept the deer away recently after battling them for a few years... they love the young plants...",

That doesn't mean better weed doesn't exist or can't be grown... but we grow some of the dankest cabage on the shelf guaranteed...\n\nAlso... like 3 out of every 100 people I know actually know how to do or are willing to do simple gardening... green is available right down the road nearly all over the state.",

Gambling will happen anyways so why not just allow casinos everywhere and tax them? Well there are obvious downsides to casinos with the whole addiction thing. I think there's probably a good balance between government allowed behavior (drugs, alcohol, gambling) vs illegal activity. Ultimately I think it comes down to the population in question which is why I think drugs should not be prosecuted or managed at the federal level but should be a state and local issue. A big city legalizing all drugs could have a very different effect on society and culture than a rural community. I don't think a blanket statement works well on either ends of the spectrum.",

If the laws do nothing, why would repealing them do anything?\n\nI explained that to you you knucklehead. The laws do plenty, but none of it good and not what was intended. It literally says in the paragraph you quoted \"repeal them all the time when keeping them is **more of a problem than repealing them**.\" \n\nChrist, you can't even fucking read.\n\n&gt;That's funny from the dishonest druggy desperately trying to equate apples to oranges for his agenda.\n\nThat's funny from a cement for brains mouth breather adhering to the doctrine of willful ignorance to just become more stupid with every passing moment.

Because they are an 'illegal' business in the eyes of the Feds, they cannot claim expenses like normal businesses can, so they are taxed not on profit but on gross.   So the IRS is making tons of money off of legal mj as it stands.  \n\nThe second thing to consider is the billions it rakes in through CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURES.  \n\nIf you don't know what CAF is, you need to look it up.   Basically its the government using any excuse to steal money from citizens.    Billions of dollars in seized assets are taken from people every year.   Finding money and weed together in the same place, gives them an excuse to claim you are a dealer and steal your money, even if they don't charge you for it. \n\nDumb drug laws have always been a way to oppress people.   There is more to the resistance of legalizing drugs to meet the eye.\n\nWhen California was trying to legalize, you wouldn't believe the lobby groups that were coming out to oppose it.  Private prisons, prison guard unions, the companies that supply goods and services to prisons,  defense lawyer groups,  bail bondsmen,  phone companies (calls from prison are a huge profit center),  etc etc ..   Locking people up for weed is big business and there were a lot of people afraid to lose their gravy train.",

Drugs convictions are an easy way to make people who don't vote for you unable to vote.\n\nI agree that probably overall they would make more money if they made it legal and taxed it.   The problem is that you have to pry the revenue from all the people who benefit  from it being illegal.   The problem is similar with transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy.

Her math basically suggested that not only would it balance the budget (this was the Clinton administration when the budget was not nearly as fucked as it is now) but would have generated revenues enough to establish social programs for drug addiction, and had enough to double the department of education with extra left over. Mind you my mom was a rural midwestern christian girl, she\u2019d maybe smoked one joint in her life this was purely a matter of math, and her professor who \u201chated the premise\u201d still gave her an A+. Nowadays I don\u2019t think the math works out simply because the debt is like 10x\n\nThat\u2019s all, story time over.",

    "postText": "My investment thesis is to buy companies growing both sales and earnings at a high rate while also being cheap when looking at forward multiples. Lets say a stock is expensive by LTM standards but due to growth it is just 6x 2025 expected earnings. As long as that growth is projected  to continue well into 2027 and beyond, by the time 2025 arrives that 6 p/e will double or triple, giving you a fantastic return.\n\nThe main thing I like to see is analyst estimates of &gt;20% growth on top &amp; bottom line for the next 3 years or so. However, every screener I've ever come across only looks at the current year forward estimates. If you just look at the last twelve months and current year forward growth you would've thought Oil &amp; Gas companies were SaaS stocks in 2022. I'm trying to avoid companies who don't expect long term growth. With my paid subscription to Seeking Alpha I'm able to to look at several years ahead of future estimates if I go to each individual stocks page. That can be an extremely time consuming process as there are over 5,000 stocks. I'm sure there is some ai tool that could pour through these pages but my knowledge is limited. Even though i have a subscription, the fact that it's behind a pay wall makes its a bit more difficult than just asking Bard or ChatGPT to look at this site. Any thoughts?",

In general AI really is just automation.\n\nYou would have to use a model like BERT and then train it with example data of what you want to look for. It can take that and then look for similar articles.\n\nMaybe Google supervised text classification using BERT. If you already know python then it doesn't seem too hard. You will need to do the legwork of fetching and parsing articles though",

That would make you a 33% return as of now or around $350. And that would be only if you bought at the exact right moment when it was 28. Prior to this date the majority owner's of doge were gifted the coin or were creators of it so there was little value in it and the monetary trades were in the 10k per week range. I made money on doge, but it's not the huge winner most people are making it out to be. It may not be going to the moon but it's hype sure is.",

Consider the following transactions:\n\n26.01.2021 Buy 100 AAPL at $143  \n29.01.2021 Sell 100 AAPL at $131  \n04.02.2021 Buy 100 AAPL at $137\n\nNow even though the taxpayer has made a loss of $120 they can not use it as a deduction because they have subsequently repurchased the same security within the 31 days where the wash sale rule applies, however  the cost basis on the shares held are adjusted for the loss. So if the taxpayer decides to sell their shares:\n\n30.04.2021 Sell 100 AAPL at $131\n\nand does not repurchase shares in the same company (or enter into a options contract that the IRS considers to be equivalent) within 31 days (in either direction)  of the last trade in the security then they can write off any losses incurred. So in this case since the initial loss was $12 per share, the cost basis is $137 + $12 = $149, and when they are sold for $131 each a loss of $180 can be written off from other gains.\n\nSo it isn't as bad as you think.\n\nStill I take a pass on day trading and would advise most people to do the same. The stress, the paperwork, the mountain of scams and bullshit it's just not worth it.",

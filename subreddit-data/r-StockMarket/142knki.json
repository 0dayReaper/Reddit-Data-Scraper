    "postText": "In my experience here is what happens most often:\n\n* Most of your losses come from when you're right but too early. In these cases a buy-and-hold will result in subpar market returns or net negatives.\n* Most of your gains come from when you're wrong but manage to survive.\n\nThe subject of this thread is more on the latter.\n\nI've simply found that being properly positioned size allows for my high probability trades to win. Most high probability trades have ended up going against me over time; most reach a defined risk, a max loss. And most of them (80% ++ ) inevitably reach a max gain, or a target price.\n\nI think we'll be wrong most of the time in the market, so being able to profit from it has become the best winning strategy in my life. I've made fortunes being wrong, but outlasting *\"The other guy.\"*\n\nAs a result I have more buying power to win, and more buying power to win means more high probability trades where I can afford to be wrong, out last the other guy, and inevitably make much more money from them.\n\nFor me there is a \"stop loss\" somewhere, but the position size is the first line of defense, DCA is the second line of defense. The position size rarely fails and when it does, the DCA almost never fails.\n\nThese strategies cannot work if you are too big; and as the legendary Tom Soznoff said:\n\n***You don't know how little, big, really is.***",

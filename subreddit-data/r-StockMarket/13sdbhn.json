    "postText": "Context, the share cancellation is part of a self-proclaimed strategy to build shareholder value, and does not signify any sort of reduction or stagnation in operations.\n\nFor example, say a company has authorized shares totaling 201,000,000, outstanding shares totaling 187,300,000, and company leadership officially announces their intention to acquire and retire 117,000,000 of their common shares. Does management simply file some paperwork, and presto, the share count is reduced, or are they actually going into the market and buying back stock of their own company?",

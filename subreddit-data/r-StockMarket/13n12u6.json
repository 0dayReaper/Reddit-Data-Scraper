    "postText": "NEW YORK\u2014Calling it a desirable low-risk, high-yield option, financial experts reportedly recommended Thursday that Americans invest in businesses the government will bail out anytime they fuck up.\n\n\u201cWe strongly encourage people to put their money in a secure corporation whose solvency the government will rush in to maintain whenever they make a stupid, negligent decision resulting in a complete collapse that sends markets into a tailspin,\u201d said Charles Scwabb financial advisor Jackie Bohlmann, adding that businesses like banks, mortgage finance institutions, airlines, automotive manufacturers, or any other too-big-to-fail companies that can count on a bailout when their avarice leads to massive failures that threaten the entire national economy are a smart and safe investment. \u201cWe suggest padding your portfolio with a handful of businesses able to fuck up so badly that the government awards them emergency loans financed by taxpayers to address their impending cash shortages. These are especially profitable if you can also invest long-term by sitting on the board of directors and paying yourself a $140,000 bonus just hours before regulators move in to perform damage control on failing business.\u201d\n\nBohlmann added that people shouldn\u2019t fear the higher interest rates for any government financial aid in such a crisis because those loans will most likely be forgiven so that executives may have the capital needed to start the lucrative investment cycle all over again.",

It's not zero, but I'm sure their creditors were not generally pleased about the situation.",

It might get skipped for some reason.

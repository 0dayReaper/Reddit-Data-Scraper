So treasuries are \"money\"; are liquidity.\n\nHaving more of them cannot possibly reduce liquidity.\n\nThe author of the statement is either openly misleading or is confused about what happens when someone takes money from equity and moves it into treasuries; etc.\n\nThey MAYBE are trying to say \"money will move from equities into treasuries and this will cause prices to go down.\"\n\nBut often time a rise in treasuries just goes back to equity as leveraged positions. 30% treasuries = 60% equity positions.",

This flood of Treasuries could lead to a decline in liquidity.  \nA decline in liquidity could make it more difficult for investors to buy and sell assets, which could lead to higher volatility and wider bid-ask spreads.  \nThis could impact asset prices across the board, as investors may be less willing to take on risk in a less liquid market.  \nJPMorgan Chase has warned that the government's massive borrowing program could lead to a decline in liquidity of up to $1 trillion. This would be the largest liquidity drain in history, and it could have a significant impact on asset prices.  \nThe government's borrowing program could also lead to higher interest rates. As the government borrows more money, it will need to offer higher interest rates in order to attract investors. This could lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could slow economic growth.",

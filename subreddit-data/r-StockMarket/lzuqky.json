It's a game of incomplete information, not random. It's also a game of disinformation. The reason so many think it's random is because to **them** it is. \n\nIMO the biggest problem is that the game is rigged so heavily against you that you're at the mercy of those who control it. \n\nYou can't make the most educated decision because the information you're getting is outdated or could be an outright lie. \n\n\nImagine if have AA and they have 72o.\n\nFlop comes and 2 weeks later and you're told it's A6Q but it's actually 772. \ud83d\ude32 Not sure if that makes complete sense but you get the idea. \n\n&gt;Genuinely, no retail investor should buy an individual stock. It\u2019s pure gambling, which is an entertainment rather than a successful long term solution.\n\nTo go back to the poker analogy I think for the vast majority the best idea is to ETF it and forget it but like poker those who win consistently aren't **just** really lucky. Absolutely luck does play a role of course but if you study and put in the time to actually learn the game the odds of success rise considerably. Everyone thinks poker is just all luck too but it's just not. I can understand why people think the market is random but I don't agree, not completely.",

Obviously some of those did not fare well at the top of the market but if you look back their initial recommendation then the stock did perform well. TMF holds for the long run but sometimes I feel they are too optimistic and they keep on piling regardless of current valuation. I find they hold some of their picks for too long when they do not perform well. TMF is smoking hopium. Some of their recommendation will go up 5 fold but they will hold the stock while it slide to eventually sell at the purchase price 5-7 years later. I feel they fall in love with some of their picks. They should hire a sell side analyst to counter balance the TMF bulls",

The problem with MF isn't their stock picks its that their buy an hold strategy doesn't do well in a downturn and their portfolio is tech and growth heavy which are getting slammed.  Go look at each of those stocks over the last 3 years.  All were huge winners even after this months blood bath.  \n\nWhen I buy a stock I set a stop loss of 7 percent from entry. If it goes up 10 percent I move the stop loss up making a guaranteed profit.  \n\nWhen shop hit 100x in my portfolio I doubled down.  I actually believe in investing as a stock rises. I don't dollar cost average down.  I'm just never going to keep throwing money down a hole on a falling knife. I have done it before and lost my ass. I am guessing you have as well. \n\nIt might magically rise in 6 months or maybe never who knows. I will take the 93 percent left and put it on stock that has good fundamentals, and positive buying pressure on higher volume in a sector that's currently green.  \n\nIf I get a 50 percent return on a stock I move the stop loss to 15 percent.  The most I am every going to loose from a stocks all time high is 15 percent. \n\nFinviz is the bomb. It can show you were the big guns are putting their money.  \n\nhttps://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec&amp;st=w4\n\nYeah a lot of boomer stocks but stocks don't go up on just solid fundamentals. They go up on demand and higher volume.  Increases or decreases on low or no volume are usually meaningless. You got to move where the Whales are feeding to profit sometimes. The last 3 years have been to easy. \n\nYou want your portfolio to go green rebalance out of tech until the tech bloodbath is over. I got 20 percent cash waiting on the bottom.  There are going to be some big gains when tech rebounds but until then I am buying xom, cop, tsn, cmi, leg until those stocks stop loss out like my tech stocks did 3 weeks ago after the most incredible stock run of my lifetime.",

Yahoo finance is really good at showing you which stocks have bullish charts and their charts are real time with a huge number of chart tools that are easy to use.\n\nThere is just a huge amount of info on finviz.

I am targeting 10 to 20 percent gains with no more than 7 percent loss on my initial position. If I make 10 good picks and 5 bad ones I sell the bad and take new positions or double a position that is overperforming. \n\nTrading on emotion is a loosing game. Making money isn't about winning on all my pics and hanging on to a dead cat in hopes that it comes alive and makes my initial guess correct.  That's ego trading.  I fuck up and pic shit that doesn't work out. Stop losses takes the emotion out of it and the human desire to be right.  \n\nI like to look at my portfolio and see all green. I don't have time to mickey mouse around with stocks that have dropped to support levels from an initial position. If a stock is up 100 percent then sometimes I will look at support levels and technical analysis to determine my exit strategy.  It's easier to do when at stock has a potential realized gain than a new position that hasn't met my mark for upward momentum.\n\nI am looking at momentum trades. Stocks that have good fundamentals, good earnings, a couple of gap ups on heavier than average volume. I'm targeting at least 20 percent return.  \n\nI manage 60 percent of my own money and keep 40 percent in a mutual fund with solid 1,5, and 10 year returns (FDGRX). If I miss the bottom on this correction the mutual fund will catch it while I rebalance back into tech positions.  \n\nI love tech. Tech is the future and big ideas make big money.",

You are pulling the trigger on a stock that you fully believe has broke out above a previous trading range. In my thinking if you have done your DD a 7 percent drop is a sign that something Is wrong in your analysis. \n\nOnce your up 15 percent if you want to use price alerts and think it out before you pull the trigger then that's understandable to stop and ask why. \n\nIf the stock decrease Is on low volume then it doesn't concern me as much as a stock decrease over several days on elevated volume.  When the Whales move out of a stock it shows up as positive or negative volume. Volume is a tell on what's really happening. It's a measure of investor sentiment. It's your oh fuck everybody is moving out or into a stock signal. \n\nWe have all seen funky shit happen to stock prices after hours on low volume.  Then at 9:30am the stock does a complete reverse. \n\nHere is explanation of what I am trying to do.\n\nhttps://www.incrediblecharts.com/technical/breakout_model.php\n\nLook at the yahoo chart.  It shows the stock in a bottom trading position and then you see it break out above 3$ on higher volume and confirm its broke out by continuing to increase in price.\n\n Once you have entered a trade you are adjusting your stop loss as it increases. \n\n This chart is exactly what I am looking for in a stock. If you  look at stocks that have had great runs in the last 3 years they look really similar. Then when the stock reaches 60$ the momentum changes and you stop out for a huge gain. \n\nI could be emotional about it and say my beloved yahoo will go back up and then throw more money on it as it falls or I can do the smart thing.  Sell it and ask why did it drop. \n\nThe answer is that yahoo was a shit company with a weak marketing strategy and people jumped on the bandwagon and made the stock overvalued until the tech crash in 2001 after that it was headed back down to 8$ before Verizon bought it.  \n\nAnything in that last paragraph sound familiar to today? Tesla trades at a price of 955 x earnings.  Even after the recent stock price drop.. That's just a totally stupid valuation.",

If you hold a 1k losing stock for 2 years and you get a 50 percent increase you made $500 dollars for two years of your time.  \n\nIf you sold at a 7 percent loss and reinvested in a 5 bagger over two years you would have made $4650 dollars over the same period.  \n\nI have done that enough times to know what the right play is. \n\nListen buy and hold is a great investment strategy. I keep 40 percent of my money in mutual funds for that reason but you have to realize the market is changing every day and you have to have a strategy that works in uncertain times.  Having money that moves with the market is the answer. Momentum trading works. \n\nI like gambling I play around with lottery ticket stocks but it's never more money than I can afford to lose. Same way I play poker at the casino.  Take $200 dollars to play $1/$2 dollar Texas Holdem and if I loose it all no big deal. I have won 1k at the table before but I have lost the 200 bucks a few times as well. If you win a little more than you lose you are doing good.  Maybe get on a streak and win 10k some time.",

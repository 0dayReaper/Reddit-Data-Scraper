However, it does matter to keep in mind that those individuals got to live comfortably for their time period and be able to afford multiple children - often on a single income.  My grandparents grew up in Southern California after moving from the midwest.  It was an absolutely amazing prospect for them.  My grandfather got injured during training for WWII so never got the full benefits of a GI but still was able to have a living on a 9th grade education.  He drove beer trucks locally for a living, afforded a modest house for 5 children.\n\nHis children, my parents and aunts/uncles grew up with some of the best public education in the country.  They were able to go to college, practically for free.  All while living in a prosperous, growing city.\n\nThey still didn't need an education to make a living.  Baby boomers in general could still get by.  In a nice location, with a skill usually but my dad never finished college and retired by 50 years old.  He is close to 70 and his retirement pension is *still* paying him more than I earn on a full college educated salary.\n\nIt's absolutely insane how quickly things changed for the worse.  Two generations and now I get to struggle with issues they never had to face.",

It's uncertain where your starting information would have started - probably the following year when the index was first published. \n\nIndices were not published for investibility but instead as economic data. To synthesize the S&amp;P500 yourself (as no mutual fund would do it for you until the late 70s and no etf would exist until the early 90s) would have required a huge outlay in 1956 (well in excess of $7450) as the index is float/cap weighted, not price weighted. At least with the Dow Jones Industrial Average you could buy 30 stocks and hold the basket yourself.\n\nThe DJIA would not be a truly 'passive' investment - if you wanted to maintain the index matching - you'd still need to update the basket periodically over the years when it changes as well as for corporate changes and splits, etc. It might be a fund kind of research project, although not one I plan on doing right now, to go through and track the 1956 basket until the present to see how that investment came out. I'm sure it would be a much better investment than gold or the house of course.",

Now mortgage rates are not gonna fall any time soon to those levels we saw a year and a half ago but it is almost certain to happen within this decade. The fed has to bring down rates at some point to bolster our economy right? And when that happens with a combination of shortage of millions of SFHs, the prices are gonna skyrocket to greater highs.....\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

    "postText": "Why the high-flying tech is considerably 'OVERBOUGHT' !\n\nThe dark side of AI is being questioned ever more and every day. It's going to be either a 'slow churn' from here or possibly a river with many abysus's-  If you stare into the abyss long enough- it will start staring back at you. Forgot who wrote that - perhaps Nietche.\n\nStocks doubling in a four-month period are especially in danger, and the aggressive ring'ing of the AI bell is sure to moderate downward.\n\nI would believe that the best competitive position ( and I've been trading for 36 years) will be realized for those 'who take the money and run'. Not a lot of room left on this particular 'runway' - at least for the NEAR TERM.\n\nHere's to a dancing GOD and have a great weekend! Hope you've been on the winning side.\n\nSTONEHENGE555",

But for the last few weeks I have been trading in and out of tech making modest profits and some small losses as I just cannot commit comfortably at these prices.  The rest of the market is getting slaughtered alter tech is sky rocketing because \u201cAI\u201d.  I can\u2019t help but feel something is in the water, but who knows.  Maybe this stupidity will continue and we lose out on massive gains.  I sold all my tech positions tonight making a small profit and grateful that I now am about 40% cash.  See what happens",

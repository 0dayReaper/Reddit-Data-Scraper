Or what do you expect the following years?\n\nNo restrictions/limits needed in this discussion, but you can add them. Would also be good to add your location/continent. For example for Western Europe anything that has to do with electricity has been growing enormously the last year and a half due to regulations (electrification of car industry - EU setting an average CO\u00b2 emmissions the car makers have to make) and the war in Ukraine. Heat pumps, electric cars, home batteries, electric car chagers, solar panels,... all have been exploding in demand. \n\nWhat do you see as important the upcoming period and how would it be profitable to play into it?",

            "comment": "I apologize in advance. \n\nLong comment to follow, blame it on the adderall:\n- Overall, I feel as though the elections will dictate most things stock market related, so I'm limiting my long-term strategy to a few energy and high dividened holds, while the remaining cash is sidelined/short term invested until after elections. \n- Volitility is going to drive the market, likely all the way into elections. VIX might be a good play but i dont follow it enough to know.\n- Extremely short-term, I'm talking as early as tomorrow (Monday), large amounts of equity are going to leave certain sectors of the market. Why you ask? I'll tell you why\n\n\nThe S&amp;P (which has been carried by tech, tech entering overbought territory) just missed closing above ~4293 Friday, which would have signaled \"officially\" exiting the bear market. \n- In the US Treasury, they're selling high yield 3/6mo bonds on Monday/Tuesday to raise funds (government poor, needz monies). \n- This years bullish run, and especially the past week, is due for a heavy pullback. With bonds going on sale Monday/Tueday, this would be a great opportunity to pull out money from overbought sectors and rotate into a low risk high yield investment. \n- The tech sector (being overbought) will likely take the brunt of a pullback. AI has great long-term potential, but it will surely receive negative media in the very near term. Not to mention other bearish catalysts imo (apple reveal this week).\n- I would expect ETFs, specifically QQQ,  to have a moderate pullback. Hovwever, instead of giving back 100% of its gains, it will [possibly] land in an area of consolidation. And to do so, consumer/basic goods stocks need to be bullish. This also follows the  sector rotation of capital.\n- Entering this week, consumer/basic goods stocks seem to have already pulled back from highs, so I can see them consolidating a bit in June or even continuing bullish to correct for the tech pullback. \n- Short term, I'm loading into Pepsi. Aside from aligning with everything above, they're financially stable, have a solid dividened, just finished a pullback from a bullish channel breakout high, and lastly, multiple technical indicators are turning bullish. 50% fib retracement bounce, daily RSI bounce off 28 (previous low within channel), weekly RSI right in the middle of channel, MACD/TSI/VI curling bullish. \n\n\n\nTLDR: ILOVETITTIES. Elections will dictate the long term market, short term market will come down a bit (mostly in tech), consumer-&gt;basic goods-&gt;energy-&gt;small cap will start seeing money rotate in. And my blood is 70% mtn dew so I'm long on Pepsi.",

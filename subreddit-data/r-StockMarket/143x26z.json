    "postText": "Many of you probably already know this but blackrock and vanguard are the 2 largest holders of basically all major companies. This is in large part because of retail investors using their etfs such as VOO and Ishares etfs for blackrock. Being such massive holders in these companies is problematic because they hold leverage over the companies that they own and can control everything. Does anyone else have a problem with this or is it just me? If anyone questions their massive positions in companies, just look up a few in your portfolio and see who the top 2 institutional investors are. I bet they are vanguard and blackrock.",

I gladly pay my 0.03% fee on VTI in exchange for the time I save by not buying and rebalancing ~4,000 different stocks myself. If that's too expensive though, Fidelity does offer completely free index funds.",

Measuring the federal deficit solely by how positive or negative it is lacks perspective because the federal budget changes and grows as well as GDP and all those other metrics. When put into perspective, your numbers are wrong and bad.\n\nhttps://www.thebalancemoney.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296\n\nHere's a breakdown of your \"facts.\"\n\nStarting off, Congress is who ultimately authorizes spending and budgets, not the president. See Trump throwing a hissy fit over trillion dollar pandemic period legislation including billions for pet projects and going to other countries.\n\nSecond, \"Biden\" only lowered the deficit so much because of an end to pandemic era legislation items that lowered government spending. So yeah, he lowered the deficit, however it was shit that was ultimately temporary to begin with.\n\nFrom the article: \"At the end of fiscal year 2020, the debt was $26.9 trillion. Trump added $6.7 trillion to the debt between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2020, a 33.1% increase, largely due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 recession.\"\n\n\"President Obama added about $8.6 trillion, about a 74% increase, to the national debt at the end of President Bush\u2019s last budget in 2009.\"\n\nAt the end of Trump's last fiscal year the federal debt was 26.9 trillion dollars. Currently, it is 31.45 trillion which means the debt has grown 4.55 trillion.\n\nIn my opinion this website gives far better perspective and way more important numbers.\n\nhttps://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/federal-budget-receipts-and-outlays\n\nThis shows the actual budgets vs the actual income of the government and if you scroll down to the bottom you can see that during bidens presidency the (estimated) receipts, outlays, and deficits have all grown massively.\n\nSo the government is not only bringing in astronomically more money, it is spending astronomically more as well. This to me says there are definitely areas we could be making huge cuts to, especially when those changes happened in just 4 years.",

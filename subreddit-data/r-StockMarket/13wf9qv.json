Everyone gets carried away with the market at some point.\n\nIf I was you, and I wasn't trading on borrowed money, I would take the hit on the chin and accept that you fucked up but it cant really get much worse than it is at present. Hell, some of the stocks are at levels that could be pretty good buy points. But some also aren't. I would just stop looking at them for a couple of months.\n\nUse the break to invest in yourself. Learn some basic TA, which can help you to not step on so many landmines. Look at a simple Bollinger band. 20 period. If the monthly close price isn't above the center line and the line isn't trending up then the stock isn't something you should be investing in. Simple momentum. There's plenty of other TA if you want to get a bit trickier. Just remember to KISS. And don't take advice on individual stocks from anyone. How do you know they aren't looking to unload their stocks onto you....  Best of luck.",

Before the pandemic, a number of these stocks were great medium to long term performers while Tesla\u2019s balance sheet issues were sufficient enough to cause people to cast doubt on its future as a public company. \n\nYou have 2 major issues. One is understanding why you own certain names. For example, relative to 2020-21 when nearly everyone was wfh, will there be more usage of zoom\u2019s core product in 2023? How can online dating grow on top of pandemic numbers as people continue to go out in person? The second issue is duplication. There\u2019s no reason to own tsm and intc, bmbl and mtch, cloudflare and crowdstrike, etc at the same time. Pick one and keep it moving. \n\nImo some of these names will come back in 5 years. Others won\u2019t. Therefore do a whittling down process to eliminate duplication, get rid of 1/2-2/3 of the portfolio, and keep ko and tsla.",

Dollar-cost averaging that to a lower cost basis is going to take ages with little certainty for the future or reward. \n\nIf you really want to pick individual stocks some tips: check if companies actually make money, check if they are in a hype bubble (like AI now the new big thing is, but Blockchain had that spot a few years ago), and switch up your choices of industry. \n\nOr just yolo it all on 0DTE option gambles and become a prized member of the WSB wall of shame.\n\nAlso do your own research and don't follow what Reddit says too much.",

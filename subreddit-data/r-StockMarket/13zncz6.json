    "postText": "Hello all I just have a quick question as a beginner and on the rules of not allowed more then. 3 trades.\n\nI thought it was 3 trades in general but I searched up and it said of the same stock.\n\nSo If i bought a options on 31st of SPY then bought TSLA option on 2nd of June and then sold both on the Following Monday 5th of June. Would that count as 4 trades and be flagged for de activated? Or because it\u2019s not the same stock i\u2019m fine with 2 trades on spy and 2 trades on TSLA?\n\nI know I don\u2019t understand this concept good enough and people might bash me but I\u2019m just trying to get a answer here not a lecture thanks",

Most brokerages don\u2019t let you do more than 3 day trades in a given amount of time, meaning you can\u2019t buy and sell a position (a stock) in the same day.\n\nIf your buy TSLA at 9am then sell it at 1pm that would be 1 day trade.\n\nIdk for sure I would need to know what brokerage this is and what restrictions they place on its traders. There shouldn\u2019t be any restrictions on simply on how many trades you make other than day trades. (Might depend on country I can only speak for the US)\n\nI\u2019ve sold 3 positions and bought 3 new positions or more several times with no warning or restriction",

Regardless, what it means is you are not allowed to trade any security in the same day more than 3 times.   If you do, most brokerages will classify you as a \u201cday trader\u201d and adjust your profile accordingly.    In most cases you will be forced to higher limits on margin trading.",

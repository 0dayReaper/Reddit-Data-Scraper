    "postText": "Yesterday, the markets experienced notable volatility, albeit within a relatively narrow range. Risk sentiment seemed to be in favor, as small and micro-cap stocks demonstrated strong outperformance. On the other hand, mega-caps played their part in boosting the Nasdaq higher, with META leading the charge despite being hit with a record-breaking fine from the EU. Nonetheless, the lingering concern over debt ceiling talks continued to exert pressure on stocks, as yesterday's discussions failed to yield any significant results.\n\nIn after-hours trading last night, the markets initially displayed positive momentum but retraced during the pre-market session this morning before gradually clawing their way back up. Small caps, as represented by the IWM, have been outperforming their larger counterparts and currently stand as the sole index in the green this morning. However, all major sectors are presently in the red, save for energy, which stands out with a noteworthy gain of nearly 1% as crude oil prices advance.\n\nGiven the prevailing market environment, we should anticipate further volatility throughout the day. The market remains highly responsive to news events, with the release of crucial PMI data scheduled for 9:45 AM and ongoing updates regarding the debt talks likely to capture attention throughout the day.\n\nLet me know if you like these posts!",

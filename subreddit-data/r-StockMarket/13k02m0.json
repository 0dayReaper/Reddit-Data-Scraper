They make it look like our money in banks is liquid but behind the scenes it very much isn't liquid. \n\nMaybe it's time to tell people that \"no, you can't have all of your money, now. You have to wait until we can liquidate some capital\". \n\nMake banks actual investments instead of everyone pretending they're just a vault. People will gravitate toward good banks and away from bad ones with the understanding that over a certain amount of money, maybe the fdic limit, you have to wait for your money to liquidate. In exchange for the legal right for a bank to say \"no, you can't have your money\", bank should be required to give a substantial portion of the interest they make to depositors. If the fed rate is 1% and they sell a loan at 5% interest, maybe the depositors could get 2% and the bank 2%.",

The only way the theory gets off the ground is if they get a large influx in liquid capital, which there is not as much out there as you think there is. Just look at the current rate of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. Also hardly anyone is going to put in more than $250k without some sort of insurance plan.

It's that CEOs/management take on so much more risk in order to increase earnings and earn bonuses, get pay raises, and get higher compensation from stock options.  This is usually fine, but sometimes that risk bites everyone in the ass and the execs walk away from the smoking ruins with 8-10 figures of net worth while others are left holding the bag and/or footing the bill to fix things.",

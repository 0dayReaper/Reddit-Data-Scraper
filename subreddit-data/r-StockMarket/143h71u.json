I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible for the market to remain irrational and continue to rally.  Just make sure you have enough cash to cover your expenses for 12 months and any other things (like a car crapping out).\n\nWorst case scenario you gain 4-5% interest on your money, and if things do hit the fan you will be prepared.\n\nIf you want to cash out a little extra for potential buying opportunities, my guess is sometime late this year/early next year the opportunities will start rolling.",

Some people are aiming for a 600 valuation. Other deep learning systems are far behind it would seem.

Being fully invested is a nice idea, and it's true that invested money is better than cash, but like everything in life, it's far from being all white or all black. I just read a bunch and watched webinars on the different philosophies being the role of cash in a portfolio (and what to do with an emergency fund). Not sure how to phrase this in English but the risk/benefit curve of cash versus bonds in a portfolio is showing that bonds are better than cash right now (the added risk of bounds is not proportional to their benefits when compared to cash, the safety of cash is taking awaycmore benefits than people think). Anyway... It all depends on when and how much you would need cash, and are you willing to take risks of having to sell something at a loss in case you need it.\n\nI personally have 10k in emergency fund, invested in 2 HISA ETFs (one is Canadian T-Bill) and 1 Common HISA Fund. But even though it's super safe while giving me a good yield, it's still getting eaten away by inflation and could provide a better return somewhere else. I could invest part of it in a low risk defensive asset, and some of it in higher risk assets. I don't expect employment to be a problem before I reach retirement (even if there's a global recession). So I decided I'm gonna invest 5k over the next 12 months or so. Even after I'm done, I would still have cash to invest or get me out of trouble.\n\nA lot of words to say I believe you should always have cash in a form or another, for emegencey and/or investment opportunities, but cash should be kept at a minimum. It's all about risk assessment.",

I normally buy shares with margin and then sell calls against them for 10-15% above my cost basis so I make 10-15% profit plus any premium. The companies that don\u2019t recover and interest are paid for entirely from those that do recover and the premium from the calls. \n\nAnd having new income to throw in is also key. My job is recession proof and thus even in a downturn I can contribute 3-6k monthly to my retirement accounts/brokerage accounts. I also have a few side gigs that would allow me to contribute a few hundred a month even if I did somehow lose my job. \u201cChicken feed\u201d it may be, but you\u2019re now purchasing double the shares you were with that same \u201cchicken feed\u201d a week ago now that shares are 50% off",

His work is entirely technical in nature but he knows what he\u2019s doing. Called the October 2022 bottom, and at that time suggested we\u2019d top again around 4300-4500SPX. He also called the start of the major oil run, and has called silver/gold tops and bottoms within dollars. It\u2019s all based on technicals and his are astoundingly accurate. Well, everyone is now saying the bear is over, new bull, etc.. what seems more likely?\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is I trust his work and I\u2019ve seen the accuracy firsthand. But if people don\u2019t care to listen, at LEAST use stop losses and proper risk management.\n\nAll that said, seven stocks have been the major mover to SPX4300. Sector rotation can keep certain companies afloat or even see major moves higher. Case in point I\u2019m still long some symbols but I wouldn\u2019t touch AI or any of the top S&amp;P market cap companies, and if you\u2019re in something like VOO, all I can say is be careful.",

(To be clear, still in a small bubble, but people seem to be okay with it). Inflation started to come back down and people realized the world will normalize, and started to pile back in.  The market is just human behavior, 20-year moving averages and sector based P/E ratios. (I.e. - the average P/E ratio of the tech sector pre-covid was 20-25).  If you consider these things, it's pretty easy to see when the market is bubbled or priced well again.  It'll continue onwards, less aggressive than before (since interest rates are higher), but it's going to continue upwards until the next big thing, at which point we buy again at more discounts.  Onwards and upwards.  FIRE'd under 40.",

Fed always cut rates before a recession and right now they are still in hiking mode.  June 2006 interest rates were the same as they are today after the market had a correction then once the effects of high cost of lending made its way to the balance sheet- all hell broke loose to floor in 2008. I agree this is a bubble but it does not continue upward from here without popping first.  Bear market of 2000 and 2008 took 5 years to fully recover. There will be more blood to spill before this returns to a bull market",

As for the ES non-commercials a multi-year low doesn't necessarily equate to a decline in the market (see my caveat of the last reply). In April and May 2020 the shorts were at multi-year lows and that was followed by a huge rally to all time record highs. They t multi-year lows Sept. of last year just before October kicked off an ongoing rally that's going into its 8th month. Oct, 2011 saw heavy short presence and that didn't end well either. I'm not saying that it's all one way or the other, I'm saying it's nuanced.",

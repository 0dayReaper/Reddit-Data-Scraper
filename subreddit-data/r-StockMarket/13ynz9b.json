    "postText": "If I could forecast what a stock's SI will be next reporting period and determine what the average price movement is for that short interest forecast, I could potentially profit from this using options if I buy at the right time with the right expiration.\n\nAnyone try something like this? Or is this not practical to do?\n\n**Here's an Example:**\n\n&gt;I run a regression analysis on $BABA. It shows that it's SI is bound to increase starting next reporting period. If I can determine what the average price movement is around what the average SI increase is, I could buy puts before the reporting starts with an expiration sometime after. Once it's SI goes up and the price of $BABA goes down, the value of my put option should go up.",

I lean heavily for price to rise in BABA.",

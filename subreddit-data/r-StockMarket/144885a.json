Everyone that's smarter than a rock has been aware that quantitative easing (money printing) creates more monetary supply. MV = PQ. We created more M, gave it to people that were most likely to spend it (V).... so very clearly, we should expect P(rices) and/or Q(uantity) to increase. We see this every time government wants to \"help.\" Government-backed student loans, mandating \"affordable\" health care, and telling banks to lend subprime borrowers all created their own bubbles... yet, here we are thinking saying \"but, nothing is the same as anything else, therefore it will definitely not cause inflation in my fantasy world.\" Corporate profits are a symptom, bad monetary policy is the root cause. Greed has always been a thing, so we have to look to see what the catalyst was that allowed this to happen.",

When the hippies aged and bought houses and got jobs with healthcare, some of them turned out to be conservatives. Once they got \"theirs\" they slammed the door on the next generation. They are the boomers of today. \n\nI grew up watching the hippies being liberals. People I know went from liberal to conservative when their fortunes changed. It wasn't a slow change. It was shocking how fast they changed. It was almost as if parking a new car in their garage made the difference.\n\nDon't go all anti-boomer about this. Half the the boomers are still liberals.",

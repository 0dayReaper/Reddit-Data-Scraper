Just because they\u2019ve slowed down doesn\u2019t mean the pain or risk is over. Between 1 month T bills at almost 6% and/or just parking in VMFXX for the time being. The best this banks are offering is like 4.25% or so outside of CDs, and who wants to do a CD right now!?",

Regional banks generally don't offer brokered CDs (which can be traded on a secondary market), which are offering higher yields than negotiated CDs right now. If your savings account is tutoring next to nothing, and your bank is offering 3-month CDs at a 4.8% annualized yield, but your broker can offer them at 5.25%, and both CDs are fully FDIC insured, it only makes sense to move parked cash to your broker and buy CDs through her/him. \n\nThat dynamic has caused a number of regional banks to become more poorly capitalized, leaving them with less money to lend and putting increased pressure on their profit margins, which in turn makes it that much harder for them to compete, both on the rates they're charging on new loans they do manage to write AND on the yields they're offering on newly issues CDs and other interest-paying products. Most institutions that haven't been horribly mismanaged (like SIVB was) will likely ultimately come out relatively unscathed, but if a given institution has a relatively high percentage of it's deposits uninsured, there's a greater chance that depositors will start rapidly pulling their deposits and running as soon as they think they're at an increased risk.\n\nI think the market is still barreling toward another significant correction that'll happen before the year ends though...",

How the market chooses to argue and speculate what these things are worth right now is somewhat irrelevant to the companies who are actually building things. BTC, ETH, and several others will be part of someone\u2019s rothIRA in the future. Whether an investor has the patience to hold while it all gets sorted out or buy later is up to them.

Too many think it's a way to get rich quick and sadly they loose .  But I in my personal opinion will stick with crypto and my other investments before I ever go back to banks ever again.

The bank is a useless middleman that just takes your money and bets it to make more money with it. Banks all operate on the most extensive ponzi scheme ever created, and it is all funded by your money that you give them. You can do everything now that used to require a bank, without the bank. Btw, you don't even understand what you're trying to argue about. Nice shilling attempt tho.",

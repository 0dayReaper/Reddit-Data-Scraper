I don\u2019t even know which brokerage calls it SIP. \n\nI would think that a robo advisor would be the only time it\u2019s \u201cstrategic\u201d so it seems like an odd term if you\u2019re literally just setting up to buy the same index automatically when you\u2019re paid.\n\nEdit: Is this a term outside of the US?

The investment amount is deducted automatically from the investor's bank account and invested in the chosen investment vehicle.\n\nSIP is a popular investment option for investors who want to invest in the stock market but do not have the time, expertise, or resources to actively manage their investments. It allows investors to invest small amounts of money regularly, which can help to generate higher returns over the long term, as the benefits of compounding get accumulated.\n\nSIP is a disciplined approach to investing and helps investors in avoiding the temptation to make lump-sum investments when the markets are high. It takes advantage of the cost averaging effect, which means that investors buy more units of securities when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high.\n\nOverall, SIP is a convenient and effective way for investors to accumulate wealth over the long run and achieve their financial goals. It is important, however, for investors to have a sound understanding of their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation, before investing in any mutual fund or ETFs through SIP",

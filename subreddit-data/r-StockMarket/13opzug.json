    "postText": "SPY finally breaking through this long-term resistance band, trading well above the AVWAP from ATH (teal), 200 ema (orange), and the AVWAP from October low (blue). Algo is giving a long signal on the daily. Very High Momentum indicator (top lines) is deep green. We're primed for a move higher this week. Let's see if we get some follow through. Good luck everyone!",

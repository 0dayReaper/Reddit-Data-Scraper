    "postText": "  The US House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to pass a bill to suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit through January 1, 2025, as lawmakers race to prevent [a catastrophic default](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/24/economy/american-uncertainty-debt-ceiling-standoff/index.html).\n\nThe bill will next need to be passed by the Senate before it can be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. In the Senate, any one lawmaker can delay a swift vote and it is not yet clear when a final vote will take place.\n\nThe timeframe to pass the bill through Congress is extremely tight and there is little room for error, putting enormous pressure on leadership in both parties.\n\nLawmakers are racing the clock to avert a first-ever default ahead of June 5, the date the Treasury Department has said [it will no longer be able to pay all of the nation\u2019s obligations](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/politics/janet-yellen-debt-ceiling-default/index.html) in full and on time, a scenario that could trigger global economic catastrophe.\n\nThe debt limit bill faced backlash from the far right and the far left, but in the end it passed the House by a wide margin with significant bipartisan support.\n\nThe final tally for the vote was 314 to 117. There were 149 Republicans and 165 Democrats who voted for the bill and 71 Republicans and 46 Democrats who voted against it.\n\nSuspending the debt limit through 2025 takes the threat of default off table until after the presidential election. In addition to addressing the debt limit, the bill [caps non-defense spending,](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/politics/whats-in-the-debt-ceiling-deal) expands work requirements for some food stamp recipients and claws back some Covid-19 relief funds, among other policy provisions.",

Whois in Putin\u2019s or Trump\u2019s (same thing really) payroll and has gotten paid much much more than what the have in stocks,  and promise of an offshore retirement?\n\nWho will it be?",

            "comment": "Im pretty sure Yellin said they found more money to push the default day to the 15th. If we do default all the Iraqi Dinar/ Vietnamese dong people were right. If we cant pay our debtors especially overseas one they will loose trust in America. This will lead to a spiraling crash in americas dollar. If this happens anything pegged to the dollar will collapse in relative velocity of the devaluation of the dollar. We could also see currencies such as the Vietnamese dong and iraqi dinar get a revalue. It could literally happen overnight since FOREX goes on 24/7.\n\nI suggest just getting 1 million in dinar and 1 million in Vietnamese dong.",

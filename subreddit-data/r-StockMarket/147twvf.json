I reallocated from a long term / growth oriented portfolio to an income oriented one. Basically I exchanged the higher overall &amp; much more volatile performance of long term investments for the lower but more consistent performance of dividend oriented stocks and ETFs such as HTGC, MAIN, JEPIX/JEPI, etc.\n\nAs a result when the broad market crapped itself lightly in 2018, severely toileted in early 2020, and dropped drastically in 2022 my income was unaffected. Had I been holding broad market indexes or individual growth stocks I'd have been screwed. And even with the recent jump in the market I'd still be far behind where I am.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the economy evolves constantly. The companies worth investing in 30, 20, even 10 years ago are often not the companies to hold today or in the future. As an example, in the last 30 years 27 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been replaced.\n\nMy point to all of this is that there are plenty of valid reasons not to \"hold forever\".",

And I think it's a reasonable approach for a lot of folks.\n\nI'm definitely a lot more cautious than I was when I was earning money. For instance I had cash available to invest during the 2020 Covid meltdown but I didn't have the balls to buy the dip (plunge?) despite having seen the market crap itself and recover I-don't-know-how-many-times since 1980. Not having a bunch of earned income coming in had way more effect on my risk tolerance than I thought it would. Probably a good thing.\n\nWhen I'm 70 or so I'll probably move into even more conservative (and lower performing) investments. We could live out our lives with a decent lifestyle if we just put everything in a cardboard box in the basement, even if the long term inflation rate is 3.5%. So really investing serves more as a buffer builder, lifestyle enhancer and to provide a bit of money to pass on to our daughter than anything else.",

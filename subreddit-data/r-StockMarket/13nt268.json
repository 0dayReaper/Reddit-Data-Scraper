Meadows is a gutless piece of shit who jumped up higher than he ever deserved after being in the HFC. The only person who has thus far surprised me after being a member of the HFC is Mick Mulvaney, and I'm not sure how to feel about that. He was such an ignorant asshole during the Obama years, but he's grown past that and really changed. I guess he really did learn more to realize the bs he was peddling before as a member of the House. Because it sure as hell was hard to find a spine anywhere in the last admin to say anything to the contrary of the Boss.",

Moreover, the idea that they have to pass legislation when Dem votes was seen as anathema to them. Since the Trump era they've radicalized more, and brought the threshold down to put forward a motion to vacate the chair, i.e. remove the Speaker, which McCarthy granted to get his Speakership over 15 votes. \n\nIf he moves forward on legislation that is palatable to Dems that is seen a sa betrayal to the HFC and the other members of the right flank in the caucus who aren't part of the HFC, then he will have that motion brought up. He will only be able to survive if he gets Dem votes in such a case, which is also a tough sell given his history since January 6, 2021. McCarthy is seen as part of the overall problem with political rhetoric today - blatant lies and an unwillingness to tell their base the truth in order to maximize their ability to win seats and govern, as a minority party in America due to gerrymandered safe districts that depend on their ever more radicalized base to choose their representative in the primaries.\n\nSo, very hopeful thinking on your part that really undervalues the politics of the House GOP caucus of today, all of which has been building up ever since the 2010 midterms. It was just abated by having a Republican in the WH during 2017-9 while they held onto their majority that they gerrymandered with the 2010 Census (and the GOP having won big in the 2010 midterms to control the redistricting process in a majority of States). It's why 2020 was so important to them to fuck with the Census during both a pandemic *and* a Presidential election year.",

I gotta hand it to Republicans - they are amazing at destroying the fiscal bedrock of this country for 40 years, through \"compromise\" or one-party control, and even more amazing at being able to pass all that debt and fiscal irresponsibility off unto Democrats.\n\nAt least Dems actually invest in projects that have a money multiplier to the economy and tax base consistently.

He will need Dem votes to stay, which I would be loathe to ever grant him if I were in the House, given all he has done by his backpedaling and silence to damage this democracy since even before January 6, 2021. Even if you could sway some Dems to vote for him or vote present to lower the bar, it would be poison for McCarthy within that conference. He would either have to abandon a lot of his positions to move center to govern as a part of a coalition government in the House, which would be the death knell for them in 2024 for certain with their base, or he's betting on Biden to try and raise the debt ceiling via the 14th Amendment to find a scapegoat and protect his position.

The Treasury isn't equipped to not pay bills on time. It'll be chaos. Social Security checks being sent 1, 2, 3 days late. Military retirees not getting their pay. Billions of dollars in late payments. Lawsuits by people who aren't getting paid.\n\nAnd the financial markets will go crazy.",

This circumstance provides that opportunity. It\u2019s already killing the markets across the globe. I\u2019ve invested a number of put options in anticipation of the worst. The eventual economic distress will also allow for sweeping changes to our current financial system. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a fed-issued digital currency come out of this in the next 24-months. They\u2019re really just waiting on the justification to be accepted. Crisis allows for all manner of actions to be accepted (see the past few years for more details). I\u2019m planning for short positions in a few key sectors to hedge against hyperinflation. I think we\u2019ll see quite a bit of turbulence in the precious metal market over the next 12-months. I\u2019m betting on a major dip in silver before a record-breaking pump. 2021 definitely had that 2007 feel and 2023 feels likes 2008/2009. Anyone tracking consumer debt, consumer spending, volatility in banking, and a hyper-inflated real estate market can see the easy correlation. It\u2019s pretty nuts to me that a number of talking heads are playing it down. The \u201cReal estate is going to keep going up\u201d theory needs to be better contextualized. Let\u2019s think about the elasticity of the average renter\u2019s/buyer\u2019s budget. Is quadrupling rent feasible when bankruptcy fillings soar?",

Lots of debate on this, very similar to loan forgiveness.  Maybe the next question is, passed it is passed does the government just keep printing money, continuing inflation. I find the economics fascinating, just never studied it enough.",

The US at this point is moving so much money they now need a bigger credit limit. Failure to raise the limit will cause nothing to happen in the short term.",

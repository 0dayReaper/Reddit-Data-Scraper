    "postText": "Hi all, I'm looking for some input on what to do regarding INTC shares currently in my portfolio. I'm still pretty new to investing (August will be 1 year in the market) and I still don't know much regarding a lot of the details that go into a company's valuation. When I first started investing, I picked up INTC shares for multiple reasons, a number of which are probably not the brightest. This was right around the time of the CHIPs Act which gave me some confidence in Intel as a longer-term holding, and as a student without a full-time job, the idea that my investment would have reasonably frequent dividend payouts to feed back into my portfolio seemed enticing. However, as I'm sure most people here know, Intel was anything but a good investment. I'm down a little over 14%, translating to roughly $124 in value lost. While I've tried to balance things out and diversify (and make more informed decisions), Intel continues to drag my portfolio down. I've been contemplating just cutting losses and pulling out entirely so my deficit doesn't continue to grow, but I wanted to see if anyone had any input before I did so. Does anyone see Intel making any sort of real comeback in 5-10 years' time, or is the consensus that Intel's poor business choices and ineffective leadership have stunted it to the point that it is going to be eternally stuck behind its competition? To simplify, does anyone think it's worth holding onto my position, or should I bail before the ship takes on any more water? Thanks in advance!",

(Not just in Taiwan, CHIPS act, etc).\n* Look at insider buying.  The INTC insiders are buying a lot of their own stock.\n* Actually have made inroads in graphics (new the new ARC cards)\n* Is going to try the foundry route.\n\nYour time frame is 5-10 years.  Most of the steps above will lead to improvements, but will be a few years to get there.  I imagine that most people will just avoid INTC for the next few years as it will be dead in the water till it starts showing improvement.  Then everyone will pile back, but you might miss some of the rebound.",

I just don't know. I like their processors more than AMD. I think they'll remain competitive but they're going to continue facing stiff competition from AMD in servers and more and more ARM processors are taking over everything other than desktops and servers and may, in 5-10 years even get into desktops themselves. \n\nIf you think it has a future, stick it out. If you want something safer and more secure, jump ship to an ETF like VOO and get a little bit of intel there, plus over 500 other companies, AMD included, to help it out a bit.",

They are backed by the US government to build state of the art foundries, as part of a national industrial strategy.\n\nEven NVIDA's CEO said that Intel would probably manufacture chips for other companies quite soon. Also, Intel still has interesting products for laptops and PCs, and their Arc GPU  is not bad at all. Some reviewers said it's a little bit better than NVIDIA in the same price range (in the 200 USD).\n\nAnd if all hell breaks loose between China and Taiwan, Intel will be in an extremely favourable position. Warren Buffet even dumped TSMC because he estimated that the geopolitical tensions were too great for his liking.\n\nAll in all, Intel is not a great stock now, but it still has some interesting potential in the near future. And I believe that reducing your position in Intel without completely liquidating all your assets could be a possibility. Just as a way of diversifying.",

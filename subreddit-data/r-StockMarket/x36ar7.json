There is more. \n\nYou can just Google ... \"Congressional stock trade tracker\" ... that should get you lots of resources.\n\nIt's difficult to track - because the reporting is all self reported. It's not automatically reported from their brokerage.  So there's dudes like Russian Rand Paul. And q-anon Trailer Queen - I forget her name she like space lazers and pipebombs- the Republicans who asked for Presidential pardons - they all hide their vaccine long stock trades for a year while he's bashing vaccines in public and doing Witch hunts on Dr. Fauci - for cultural purposes. And there's no penalty- it's like the exact same legal repercussions as a 100 dollar parking ticket.\n\nThat's what I would change - make it a requirement of the broker.  Not the Congress person. To report trades.\n\nAnd just restrict Congress to index trading.  Simple.",

That's why she lost in Georgia.  Same thing with the other Georgia Senator - Perdue - he was trading more than he was sitting in the Senate.  \n\nRepublicans literally lost the Senate majority because those 2 Georgia Republican Senators were too busy trading stocks. That's why they lost those weird January 5th elections. \n\nThere's Republican Party politicians who do more stock trades than I do.  And I really do a lot.\n\nBut it's totally insane that MAGA Republicans lied about Death To America. That's psychotic. That's what Hannibal Lecter would do.",

That's a different topic altogether.\n\nWhatever restrictions the Executive Branch is doing on Nvidia's AI chip sales- don't have anything to do with the Legislative Branch.\n\nNancy Pelosi does not trade stocks. She doesn't have time for that-she is the Speaker of the House. Way too busy for stocks. Paul Pelosi has a hedge fund since before most wall street bets guys were going peepee in pampers- Paul's best trade lately was Roblox - a video game thingy.  That's certainly can't even remotely be related to Congress.  \n\nThis Nvidia trade was -I thought it was- a call options exercise from over a year long trade by the looks of it. Nvidia is a mainstream stock,  not some fringe pork belly futures. This Nvidia trade doesn't even look to be that great of a trade. Does he even beat the SPY index? \n\nJoe Biden has never owned a stock in his entire career and he's from the state with the most Fortune 500 companies. Delaware has more corporations than people. Never traded any stocks that's why people like him and why he got re-elected so many times. All his taxes are public records since 1973 - 50 years of public scrutiny. Bro. \n\nNot every politician is corrupt just because you don't like them. That's why Fox Ewes tells you to hate them.\n\nPeople get way too distracted by social culture issues and don't put enough energy towards supporting politicians who actually do fight corporate corruption and Congressional Fraud and Governmentfraud prevention. We don't give enough support to make anything happen in the United States Senate. That's the millstone hanging from everyone's neck. \n\nThe only politicians in Congress who don't take money from corporations and corporate donors is AOC and several progressive politicians like AOC. \n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse. Katie Porter. Ron Wyden. Those are some ones on the good guys team.   \n\nWhether you like it or not - whether you like them or not- they're the only ones who put Humans ahead of corporations. \n\nThe only way to get corruption reforms, elections and voting reforms, and restore basic Civil Rights for women is to get a Senate majority. \n\nAll of these types of issues that people want - have already passed Bipartisan Bills in the House of Representatives over the past decade.  A thousand Bipartisan bills have passed in the House of Representatives and it only takes 1 email from any Republicans to force a 60-yes vote just to get a senate floor debate. Not even a vote-Republicans just won't even allow any debate. That's Conservativism 101-don't allow debate in the first place.\n\nConservatism is simply put: Loyalty to Elitists.",

The DnC blocking the truth about Bidens criminal son is an absolute obstruction of the election. Just think if it was reversed and it was Trumps laptop instead...  start at least trying to be unbiased for 5 seconds..I know its hard...you can do it...",

He never even bought a house in DC- he commuted by train every day. \n\nBiden wrote a book about Being Friends With Obama.\n\nThat's what made him all that money. Sometimes there is Political Donor groups that buy books to give away to folks.  That could be a part of his books sales-probably is a part. But many people are saying it was also a good book that told a unique story. Different than other books about Obama...\n\nLots of people wrote boring books about Obama, right? That's easy to do.  Anyone could do that - from newspapers and whatever. Everyone focuses on the first president with only 1 white parent. Right? \n\nBut Nobody else wrote a book about being friends with Obama.  So Joe's book had a different type of human interest.  And more real customers than other books about Obama.  Because it was just more interesting and authentic original comments and ideas.  Than other boring biography books. He was friends with Obama for 8 years and stuff. And vice presidents are practically invisible- so nobody heard from him during Vice presidency. \n\nNobody even knows what vice presidents do!! Lol",

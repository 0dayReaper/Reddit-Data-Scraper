    "postText": "OPEC has not yet invited journalists from Reuters, Bloomberg and Dow Jones News to cover this weekend's ministerial meeting in Vienna, which is expected to discuss future oil policy, sources said. No reason was reportedly given by OPEC, but it has invited journalists from other publishers. According to market speculation, this may be the result of the agencies previously reporting on some of the Saudi energy minister's comments and infuriating the market, with officials later accusing the news agencies of taking them out of context. An OPEC source said that journalists would not be able to enter the OPEC ministerial meeting secretariat or attend the press conference at the end of the meeting if they were not invited.",

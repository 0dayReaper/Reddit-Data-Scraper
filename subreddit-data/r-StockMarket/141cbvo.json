Not only that on the surface, but the moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans basically just told the extremists from both parties to fuck off and got the deal done together.\n\nIs the actual deal good or ultimately solve anything? No.  But the dynamic of inter party fighting and bipartisan agreement in the face of their party mates gives me a sliver of hope that we have exhausted the novelty of the extreme representatives and hopefully we are moving back toward a more centrist view, at least to some degree.\n\nIf we ever hope to get the deficit and total debt under control, it is going to take a lot of bipartisan agreement.",

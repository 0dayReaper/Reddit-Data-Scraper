Tech companies want the same thing. \n\nMicrosoft was quite literally sued for monopolizing for adding internet explorer to windows, choking Netscape. Microsoft doesn't make computer, but they make the OS, the active directory, the server OS, and the office word processor, spreadsheets. They dominate business with a near monopoly.\n\nAnd it's not like economy of scale doesn't exist. It is objectively more efficient, except until their is no competition and they can start doing less work and charging more to match where the companies marginal return and marginal costs meet. At that point the government can demand a \"fair price\" where demand and supply actually meet.",

Why? because it's not fucking free to host/maintain this portion of the platform.\n\nIf Twitter Blue isn't as successful as they need it to be? That 20% will absolutely become 30%.\n\nIn the same way, Apple's app store is a fucking platform to sell your items. It's not free to run and will never be free to use. They aren't even taxing *everyone* like other platforms are... just those who make over $1m annually from the sale of their app on the app store. \n\nIf you sell a good/service on another companies platform you're going to pay a 'tax'. Every single one does this. Whether it be through rev share or up front in points if you sell a good. \n\nI just don't get it. If anything, Apple is rather generous by not charging the first $1m you make annually.",

There is a moralistic and ethical difference of saying, \"anonymous users that purchase hemorrhoid cream are more likely to purchase bran muffins, if some person purchases one, they should be offered the other.\" vs \"Jon Doe from Central Manhattan, husband of Jane Doe and father of Sam just purchased hemorrhoid cream, because Jane is also a baker, you should sell her bran muffins to give to her butt hurt husband\". Ultimately, the latter is what people chose to do for their products.\n\nTwitter doesn't provide enough value to be a premium, subscription based application in my opinion. Many apps don't provide that level of value... but until anonymized advertising becomes a whole lot more popular and people are more widely accepting that anonymized advertising is a better way to go than the current method, we're going to see a lot of apps trying to go the subscription route.",

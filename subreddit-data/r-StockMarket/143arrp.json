How do they do that? \nBy selling T-Bills! \nHow do you get investors to drop stocks and flock into t-bills? \nBad economic news, more turmoil, nuke fears from Russia, talks about global meltdowns, etc. Therefore sparking fear among investors and forcing them into t-bills like herding sheep into a stable.\n\nOf course it will hurt stocks.

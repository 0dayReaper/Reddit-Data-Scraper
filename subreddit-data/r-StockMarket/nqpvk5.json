The national exchange halts shit all the time for various reasons. One of which is when a security goes up or down way to fast. They pause trading for 5 minutes to allow everyone time to reposition and avoid a wave of margin calls that trigger more margin calls. It's to prevent a flash crash that could wipe billions from retail as well as hedged retirement funds. The Robinhood fuckery is all about blocking specific actions like letting you sell, but not buy a security. I think there were 5 halts on AMC all together throughout the day.",

When the price of a stock shoots up, more people want to buy the stock at the strike price, since it\u2019s below the current price, ans the option appreciates. If you have a $10 AMC call, you own the right to buy 100 shares of AMC at $10 - if the price is $60, someone can buy that contract and instantly turn around and sell those 100 shares (that they bought at $10) for $60, meaning they make serious cash. There are other things like implied volatility and expirations, but that\u2019s the basic gist. Put options are the same, but owning the right to sell at a strike price - that\u2019s why the contract value goes up when the stock price drops",

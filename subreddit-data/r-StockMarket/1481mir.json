    "postText": "I was give a sum of stock options granted by my employer as a bonus last year. Half of these have vested, but the market value says $0 in E*Trade. I\u2019m trying to understand what the potential value of these options are in this context. Since the stock has dropped since they were initially granted last year, I believe the options are currently underwater.\n\nIf I were to exercise them below the exercise price, would I have to actually pay the difference and lose all the shares? Or would I get all of the shares for their currently market value and just pay the difference? Also, what could the potential value be if I hold onto them until the market value is (ideally) above the exercise price?\n\nI\u2019m struggling to understand why this would be considered a bonus if a stock option is just a \u201ccoupon\u201d to buy shares at a certain price.",

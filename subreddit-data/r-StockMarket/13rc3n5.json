    "postText": "My two cents tell me that the ECB does not really care about economic growth or collapse in this case. It will keep hiking and following the Fed despite clear differences between American and European economic resilience. \n\nThe Fed might pause in June (even if it\u2019s temporarily) to assess the economic climate as per the latest FOMC transcripts. \n\nECB is a toxic cocktail for Europe and fundamentally politically driven.",

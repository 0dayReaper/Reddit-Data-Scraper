With dividends included S&amp;P 500 has returned 669%.\n\nThis doesn't seem so bad for gold still until you realise 20 years is a massively cherry picked stat in favour of gold considering it had just lost value for the last 20 years prior to that. If we go back 50 years gold has returned 2528% or 346% in real terms after removing inflation.\n\nMeanwhile over the last 50 years the s&amp;p500 has returned 14000% or 1918% in real terms.\n\nSo if you'd invested the equivalent of todays 100k 50 years ago you'd have turned that into $346k over 50 years by investing in gold, not bad.\n\nIf you'd put that same equivalent to todays 100k into the S&amp;P500 50 years ago you'd have $1.9 million",

The recent downturn had different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions. Nonetheless, the committee concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warranted the designation of this episode as a recession, even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions.\"\n\nhttps://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021",

You\u2019re right that 2 quarters is the traditional shorthand definition.

Why would they do that, you might ask? Either because they\u2019re short real estate/commodities etc and want to take advantage per$onally, or they have some link to a preferred political outcome or regime change ($$$$).

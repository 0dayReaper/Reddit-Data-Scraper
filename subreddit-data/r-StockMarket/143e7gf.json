    "postText": "Hello, first time making a post here.  I\u2019ve been following Bt shareprice for sometime now. I noticed that at its peak this year and around 160p it dropped down to 140p. Turns out they announce 55k job cuts. \nFirst question - how can cutting jobs (saving money) affect the share price in such a dramatic way?\n\nI\u2019ve noticed today it\u2019s bounced back all the way up to 150p in a day. I can\u2019t find anything online that suggests why this is, maybe an article will come out tomorrow about it. \nSecond question - does anyone know why this nearly 10% increase today occurred? \n\nFrom BTs history (apart from some very silly mistakes), they\u2019re are easily worth more than the current share price, so anything under 200p has got to be a bargain for the long term investor. Yes I\u2019m writing a lot more just so that I can get my main question out which is:\n\nDoes anyone know why the shareprice went up so much today and appears to still be climbing.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "When a company announces job cuts, it can have a significant impact on its share price, often in a negative way. Investors might interpret this move as a sign of financial distress or operational challenges within the company. Job cuts can imply that the company is struggling to control costs or facing difficulties in its business, which can make investors nervous and lead to a drop in the share price.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the sudden bounce-back in BT's share price, it's a tricky one to pinpoint without more information. Reddit can't always provide real-time explanations for every market fluctuation, especially when news hasn't caught up yet. It could be due to various factors such as positive market sentiment, speculative buying, or some undisclosed news that hasn't made its way to the public yet. Sometimes, stock movements remain a mystery until further information emerges or analysts offer their insights.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you mentioned that BT's historical performance suggests it's worth more than the current share price, which is an interesting observation. However, it's essential to remember that the stock market is influenced by numerous factors beyond a company's performance, such as market trends, investor sentiment, and even global events. Evaluating a company's true worth requires a comprehensive analysis of its financials, competitive landscape, and industry dynamics.",

Although Reddit doesn\u2019t have all the answers, today it pulled through :)\n\nOne reason I believe it\u2019s worth more than current price is due to the the Openreach leg of BT group alone, their main \u2018downside\u2019 within the last couple of years has been investing alot of money into a complete fibre infrastructure across the U.K. it takes a hit short term, but this investment will surely have a good impact in the future after all installation costs have been complete due to the very low/no maintenance cost that fibre brings, compared to the legacy copper infrastructure currently being removed. It will be a long term investment, 5-10 years, but I could easily see it climbing to \u00a34-\u00a35 after they complete their infrastructure. \n\nI will look further into their competition now I think. Thanks again.",

The transition from legacy copper infrastructure to fiber is a big move for BT, and it does come with upfront costs. If BT successfully completes their fiber infrastructure and the market recognizes its value, it could indeed have a positive impact on their future prospects.",

            "comment": "Telecommunications companies tend to have tons of debt due to needing to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, BT Group also has a big pension deficit and the UK economy is considered to be facing significant challenges, hence why you will find a lot of UK companies being very undervalued.\n\nPersonally I would be wary of telecom companies in general and only invest in them if you feel really confident in them.",

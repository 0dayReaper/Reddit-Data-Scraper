    "postText": "Big plans coming for Amazon. For such an industry leader, revenues will be boosted due to AI implementation and expansion investments made in India. \n\nNot only their shopping platform but the use of Alexa I believe will be in most households within 10 years. A chatbot able to communicate with its user and answer any question instantly. So a way better and upgraded version of the Alexa there is now. \n\nThey just offer endless utility for other things as well such as their super popular streaming service Amazon Video, and their cloud computing services for businesses. \n\nFor such a good price at $118 due to the recent hit they took, I\u2019m buying. \n\nAlways love to hear your thoughts and feedback!",

But before taking a position on Amazon, I would ask myself, to know if I'm paying a fair price:\n\n* Will Amazon benefit more from AI than his competitors? Compared to Microsoft Azure for example (and there are many others)?\n* Why would most households want to buy Alexa? Many people are fed up with large corporations intruding in their lives. Will most household want to have such a device in their home?\n* For those who want that, will Alexa really be so superior to alternatives, such as those from Google and Apple?\n* Will Prime Video benefit more from AI than Netflix, Disney or anyone else in the streaming business?\n* It seems households will be spending less for consumers goods in the coming months, because of rising interest rates. How will that impact Amazon?\n* Will AWS growth remain as strong as is has been in the current economic context?\n* How well will Amazon compete with Alibaba in India?\n\nIf I had a positive answer for all the questions above, I would go ahead. If not, maybe I would wait to see if the stocks goes back in the 90-100$ range, or commit less money for a position on Amazon.",

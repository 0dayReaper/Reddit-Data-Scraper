Rules:

Search Before Posting: Please [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/search) before posting to help us cut down on repetitive posts. If you are new to the markets, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/search?q=getting+started&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) or see our resources in the sidebar.

No Self Promotion: Self promotion means sharing content that you could personally or indirectly benefit from. For example:

- Promoting your Discord server, YouTube channel, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, personal subreddit, etc

- Selling trading services, chat room access, educational content, DVDs, books, etc

- Driving traffic to your website, mobile app, etc 

- Posting referral links for "free shares", sign up links, surveys, requests for beta testers, etc

Self promotion may result in a permanent ban

No Spam: In general, if you have to ask "is this spam?" - it's spam. Spam includes but is not limited to:

- lazy or low effort posts
- copying and pasting the same post across multiple subs
- Posting the same thing multiple times in the same sub
- clickbait, self promotion, referral links, surveys, and anything else that could be regarded as shady or unwelcome.

Violating spam rules may result in a permanent ban.

Absolutely NO Harassment: Well-reasoned arguments and disagreements are welcomed.

Harassment and personal attacks are not. We have a zero tolerance policy for this rule. Harassment includes but is not limited to ad-hominem attacks, racism, discrimination, sexual harassment, hateful/violent language, slurs, and in general just being an asshole. If you are being harassed, report it to us or Reddit admins. If you are harassing someone, you will be permanently and immediately banned and reported to Reddit admins.

No Pump &amp; Dumps/Low Volume Stocks: Avoid sharing content involving low-volume stocks (less than 500k shares average daily volume), OTC stocks, penny stocks/microcaps (&lt; $200 mil Market Cap) and other market instruments that could be easily influenced by a large amount of exposure. Do not attempt to manipulate the market using our subreddit or push any sort of personal agenda with regard to trading.

Flair Meme Posts!: This subreddit's purpose is to analyze, discuss, and participate in stock market related areas. Jokes, images and memes might not add much quality. You can post memes, but be sure to flair them. You may face a ban if your memes are terrible.

No Low Effort Posts: If posting a link, we ask that you provide some commentary behind the link unless the title is self-explanatory and significant. Any text post that is just a copy and paste of the article content will also be considered low-effort. A post that is just an image without any comment or explanation will also be considered low-effort. Posting your positions, or P&amp;L, without market or risk commentary will be considered low-effort.

Memes only on weekends: Please only keep memes to weekends, we will remove them if posted on a weekday.

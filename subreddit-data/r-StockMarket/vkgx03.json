On top of that Burrey initially inquired about options in shorting crypto; shortly before it hit ATH. He never ended up taking short positions against Bitcoin; but given the current rate of collapse in crypto, I imagine he strongly regrets not taking any of those short positions.",

I also don't understand the value of decentralization - maybe because I don't understand the appeal of it. A real currency is backed by a real government that has some accountability for it and mechanisms to protect and elevate it. You can disagree how they go about things, but there is something there there, whereas in crypto there is no responsible party at all (from what I understand). Why would that be more appealing in any way?",

There will only ever be 21mil bitcoin created and they\u2019re coded to be released in certain intervals as to not cause inflation. To create new bitcoins they must be \u201cmined\u201d which must be a nod to when money was gold and silver. Work must be done, time and resources spent to increase the supply vs a few politicians deciding to push the button on the printer. Every country has a different currency where as bitcoin is borderless. I suppose it is only backed by trust and paper money is backed by militaries. Bitcoin was created in response to the financial crisis of 08? Predatory lending, then bailouts. Politicians and banks escape Scott free while taxpayers foot the bill and ordinary citizens are crushed. I believe bitcoin was created to be immune to the whims of politicians and central bankers and to give People an alternative to place their money and faith in. I often hear bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d bc it\u2019s not efficient as a currency and neither is gold. But it\u2019s an alternative to stocks, bonds and other fiat backed assets. The debate as to whether bitcoin is better than gold is a whole other topic.",

Distributors like tikitek issue tickets with a serial, and couple that serial with a purchaser ID. Afaik, to resell tickets in a lot of cases, festivals for example, the new owner will need to have the ticket name/ID changed in order to utilise it on site. The ticket serialisation in combination with the ticket holder name/ID provides the same function as a key pair that proves ownership of an NFT. (Unless I misunderstand the process) I can\u2019t think of any extra security being provided simply by requiring a device and key pair to provide entry. Nor would the infrastructure (for lack of better word, blockchain) for these processes. In both circumstances they would be privately maintained by the ticket issuer. A physical copy of a ticket, serialised and coupled with an owner name/id might be less secure to lose than if you lost your phone/device for example; but assuming the ticket checking is done correctly, you would also have to misplace an ID, which ultimately would have little likelihood of matching whoever found it. Furthermore some issuers have a lost ticket process to counteract theft, by reissuing the same ticket with a new serial so that the missing ticket would bounce. I can\u2019t see a single advantage that a massive distributer like a ticket company would have to tearing down existing and legacy back ends to essentially provide the same exact service.\n\nIf I am wrong (and I expect I must be with the sheer amount of interest in the NFT zone) feel free to jump on me and tell me where I lack the understanding!",

Someone in here was calling crypto a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d the other day. \n\n\nYou find me one person that actually made a lot of money selling beanie babies second hand. They were \u201cvaluable\u201d in price only via books that were made assigning value to them. There was no clearinghouse for people to buy beanie babies second hand. There wasn\u2019t people actually paying these assigned \u201cvalues\u201d. Meanwhile bored apes are still selling for 100k+ to this day on OpenSea which has only made it easier for the last year to get into NFT\u2019s. \n\nI expect to be downvoted and have no intelligent conversation take place after making this comment but I\u2019d love to hear from people either positive or negative who actually are knowledgeable on the topic",

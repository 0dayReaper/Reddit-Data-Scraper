It's the reason why rich people almost never sell any shares, and therefore don't generate a taxable event. They use their shares as collateral, and banks lend money against it with very, very little interest. This is how millionaires and billionaires fund their lives while only having a 50k salary or whatever they claim on their taxes. They definitely aren't paying their fair share, and the historical wealth transfer that took place during Covid has only made things worse.\n\nOf course the govt won't actually do this because they probably participate in securities based lending themselves, as well as insider trading and all the other bs. If they combined more regulation (or an outright ban) on securities based lending + a ban on publicly elected officials holding individual stocks, that would change things a lot.

Does below check out?\n\nSo let's say you take out a loan on $1,000 (trying to make numbers simple).  5% interest rate, as it is secured, over 10 years would make payments $11 per month &amp; be a cost of $273 in interest over the life (i used an online Amortization Calculator).\n\nNow, if they actually receive a 5% return then the first year you made $50 and your payments were $132 (i'll ignore the tax deduction for the $48 portion of that which is interest).  Because of compounding returns, you will have $1,628.89 by the end of the 10 years. It will have costed you $1,273. So you have made $355.89 (plus the tax credit for interest paid).\n\nMultiply this by 100x or 1,000x or 100,000x and those returns aren't anything to joke about. If you are able to beat the 5% returns then things can get much bigger. If you are stuck with only 2.45% compounding returns, then you basically breakeven (plus tax credit benefit).\n\nSo if you are able to withstand the cashflow difficulties in the front end of the loan, it is pretty much a no brainer.\n\nI think the math checks out (sorry for being a nerd).  That is pretty wild and i hadn't thought about it like this until i read your comment.",

Sorry im sitting here and bugging you with notifications as i nerd out.\n\nIt's a 35% return on the loan if you can match your interest rate over a 10 year note (3.5% yearly).  If you then look at the initial $1,000 that you are using as collateral, you have a 62.8% return (no interest cost on the investes collateral).\n\nWith all this combined you have turned your expected 6.28% avg yearly return into 9.78%.  That's a 56% increase in return.\n\nNow, here is where i guess I've messed up. We are assuming they they are using a portion of the loan to fund their lifestyle. So after doing the math, they would be able to live off of ~21.6% of the loan and still breakeven (with added tax deductions) if they were able to get average returns equal to the 5% interest rate.\n\nWith this in mind, the loan would only get the lifestyle paid for in the year it is taken (because there's no additional payout in subsequent years without taking another loan).  So they would essentially be limited to take out a loan equal to their net worth divided by the length of the loan. In this case, 10 years. So if you use this example and want to live off $50,000 a year... You would need to have a net worth of $2,314,814 for you to be able take out a secured loan each year without having your net worth drop.\n\nIn comparison, Elon Musk has an estimate net worth of $292.6 billion. Business insider estimates that 88.7% of that worth is in stocks/businesses. This means that in the example of 5% interest over 10 years, with a 5% return, Elon would be able to live off of 5.6 billion ($5,605,981,920) each year by simply taking out a loan. It would also allow his net worth to stay at its current level while having that level of lifestyle (and gaining tax deduction for interest payments on loans).\n\n...Pretty wild...",

Or in many of their cases (the ultra wealthy), banks loan to them because they have enough assets that they could theoretically liquidate to pay off the debt, so they don\u2019t need to put up any collateral, ie \u2018they\u2019re good for it.\u2019 They obviously have assets as well as direct access to people that run the banks and underwrite the loans. \n\nSo what happens is you have a billionaire. They borrow money from a financial institution. They put up stocks as collateral, or more likely, because they have such a high net worth, a bank will just grant them a loan. Later they take out a slightly larger loan to cover the previous loan and other expenses. This is possible because even if they didn\u2019t put up any collateral, their net worth has increased due to the value of their assets increasing, and it can justify the larger loan. Rinse and repeat. And loans are not counted as income and therefor, untaxed money. And the assets (usually stocks, etc) are not taxed unless they cash out. \n\nSo then it comes time to pay up when they reach the end of their life span. Lenders can take money from the deceased\u2019s estate, but billionaires, due to being wealthy, receive ridiculously low interest rates on loans, and are at worst having their estate pay back the amount borrowed. And in most parts of the US, creditors have only a 3-6 month window that they are legally able to collect a debt from a deceased person\u2019s estate. I can absolutely see a group of soon to be extremely wealth heirs running down the clock on that one. Regardless, they were constantly cycling loans to cover the previous ones, so these loans never accrue much interest anyways. Largely those assets will pass on to the heir(s). And if the assets are transferred to heirs before death, a creditor may be SOL. \n\nAnd that last point is key: gifting or passing on a stock through inheritance or a \u201cgift\u201d absolves the receiver of any long term capital gains tax liability. They get to start off at zero. In the event someone that inherits/is given the stock, their tax burden is basically $0 if they decide to sell it immediately. And since the asset is no longer in the hands of the soon to be deceased, it will not be a part of their estate and protected from creditors. \n\nBut most likely, receivers of these assets won\u2019t sell them immediately. They\u2019ll most likely continue the cycle of \u201cbuy, borrow, die.\u201d",

And that house has appreciated in value over the last year, correct? Your home rose in value by 8% in 2020. That means your $250k house increased in value by $20k. So, how about we tax you on that $20k you \u201cmade\u201d?\n\nThe inevitable answer: but I didn\u2019t actually make $20k! **Ex-fucking-actly you dense fuck.**\n\nTaxing business owners and investors on unrealized capital gains is exactly the same as taxing everyday people on the appreciation in their home value. Just because the shit you own is worth more money doesn\u2019t mean that you actually have that money. If you do that to small-to-medium size business owners, and specially those that are privately held, they will run out of money quick and in a hurry. You will drive them into bankruptcy.

It isn\u2019t a gain until you sell folks.\n\nImagine making widgets in which you have a full inventory and you haven\u2019t sold them yet. Suddenly the government comes to your business and says \u201csay you got a lot of widgets,\u201d we\u2019re going to charge you 30% of the value of each.\u201d Your profit margin is 10%. What would that do to your widget business? \n\nNow let\u2019s stay you own $1,000,000 in stock of a company. You make 10% gains that year. The government comes in and says \u201cwe know you haven\u2019t sold but you owe us 30% of your gains.\u201d Now you\u2019re forced to sell part of your stake in the company to pay taxes. You made money but you have less shares and therefore less ownership. So your ownership goes down continuously. What will this do to the capital markets?\n\nThere is a very very good reason it is not a realized gain until you sell folks. \n\nSome will argue that they can borrow against their equity in a company \u2026 which any business owner can do, publicly traded or not. In fact you can borrow against the equity of your home. So what? Do you pay taxes on your purchases? Can you use that money to start your own business? Will that business be taxed? Will that businesses purchases be taxed? See where we\u2019re going here?\n\nI doubt the critics here actually own property \u2026 but the should certainly get out of the stock market as they have absolutely no clue what they\u2019re buying \ud83d\ude09",

Why don't YOU come up with an idea, earn billions, and then pay as much taxes as you want? Don't patronize a company for doing what's best for them. They don't owe the government anything.

There is no value in a society for anyone to have that amount of wealth. You can still incentive just as well and have a reasonable upper limit of what should be obtainable.\n\nAnd if you really think a capatalist society gives everyone an equal chance, then I don't think there is any point in discussing things because that is just objectively false.",

Is there any proper way to tax this? It's just like if I bought 2 houses and after few years if the prices of the houses increase. Should I pay taxes on the increased value? &amp; how do you fairly tax the capital gains?",

Who wants conspiracies? \n\nDon't fall into the trap of shady shit being dismissed by being labelled a conspiracy theory. It wasn't always a derogatory term and the fact that it has become one is in itself is partially in the realm of conspiracy. Worry about evidence and build the most logical picture you can with it. Most people instantly throw away perfectly valid evidence and even stop entertaining the thought once that term gets inserted. Imagine if I could pick your pocket and then when you started presenting evidence I could just say \"nice conspiracy theory, where's your tin foil hat?\" and you immediately back down because you're more worried about how you're perceived than the fact that I took your wallet. What kind of power is that to be able to call anyone who speaks against you crazy and have the general public join you in dismissing that person! Imagine all the scumbag shit you could do if you were so inclined!\n\n\n\nedit- Conspiracies aren't exclusive to America in the slightest btw. Any group from any country can conspire to do some shit.",

A short can drive the price down, but when the short position closes, the same shares must be bought back driving the price up again. All things equal and without other market participants, the price would have been back at the original level after a short and the trader would have a loss of fees.\n\nHe's blaming price decrease to hedges shorting, but he's forgetting about people just selling and overestimating the power of a single market participant (or collusion of). \n\nHe's correct in saying that some might purposefully be selling off or shorting a big size in an attempt to trigger panic selling and then buy back/close shorts at a lower price. But this is a risky practice, it's the inverse bet of buying a big amount expecting to trigger mania (\"fomo\") or short squeeze and selling at higher price (see GME). These practises are not illegal because it is expected that other market participants will eventually bring back the price at a reasonable level (higher if the short/selloff was too aggressive, lower if the buys were too). Most orders actually try to avoid any market impact (price movements) by algorithms.",

One after the other, first one went at 100. Next is at 99.99, then 99.98 etc. etc\n\nHe goes on to say back in his day, when shorting stock, you couldn't do that. You could never under bid the last price.\n\nSo if the last sold share was at 100. You had to try to sell your short stock at 100.01. If it was above the price you want to sell, you had to wait until it dropped. Not drop it yourself by selling shares, with a bot, mind you, faster than any human could do it, one after the other after other and on and on and on until you drop the price to where you want it.\n\nThat's what I believe he's saying.",

And then 2 short hedge funds attempt this mythical ladder attack and agree to sell a bunch of shares back and forth to each other.\n\n1 million shares at 99.99 from a to b\nThen 1 million shares back from b to a at 99.98.\n\nIn theory I can see how that could be used to make the price look like it's crashing....but\n\nThose orders still go out to the market, they can't bypass the market.  (Correct me if I I am wrong)\n\nSo at any point in time during the descent if a person who actually likes the stock comes along and says I want to buy the stock and hodl it, their buy order would take from the shares that the hedge funds are trying to bounce off each other.  Then that's less shares for them again.\n\nWhat do I have wrong here?",

But in a dumb way, that is one of the answers as to why bitcoins have value. ANYTHING is valuable as long as you can trade it for something else valuable. The speculators create a demand for bitcoin so if you have some, you could sell it to them for something you want like traditional money. To be fair, a much more healthy and sustainable demand would be if people actually started spending bitcoin for goods and services. And that is the \"real\" reason bitcoin is worth something - the technology allows for these coins to be transferred back and forth in a secure way to back commerce. A merchant would accept it because they could pay their operating costs with it. And a person would accept it as pay because they could pay for their lifestyle with it.",

If you buy $500 worth of stock you now must have an additional **$1500** in your account to back it up or the slimy brokers issue you a margin call. This a dirty game played by the brokerage houses when they want to keep people from trading and keeps small traders who don't have the capital from purchasing stock and forces traders to sell their positions if they don't have 300% of the money they put up to buy their shares. This is criminal because why should anyone be forced to put up an extra 300% when a stock is bought outright with cash?! If the stock goes down all you can lose is what you put up. There are no margin calls when you did not buy using margin. Margin is borrowed money from the brokerage house. WTF",

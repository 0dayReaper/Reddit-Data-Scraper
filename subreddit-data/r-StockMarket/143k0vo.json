I\u2019m looking at the monthly on NVDA and I\u2019m seeing what looks like a pretty classic head and shoulders pattern. Could we be seeing a possible short term reversal for NVDA? Would now be a good time to enter a quick short position to try and capture this possible reversal?",

            "comment": "That's not a head and shoulders. First of all TA requires candles, because the wicks and bodies are just as important.\n\nThis is what you're looking at on the monthly: Also your \"monthly\" is just the last month. You're looking at daily price still.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/)\n\nOn the daily this is called a tower.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/)\n\nIt could signal reversal, but it could just be a pause and more upward.\n\nTech Analysis is more about target price and risk management than about predicting direction. How much risk does it have to do the opposite of what you think, and how much reward could be expected if it does what you think.\n\nBulkowski's patterns are very good for their target pricing. Most patterns are 50/50 on which direction they go, and they have 4 ways of getting there.\n\n1. Go your way\n2. Go against you.\n3. Go your way but then bust and reverse direction\n4. Go against you then bust and go your way.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/)\n\nThis gap is a significant problem for bulls, gaps are usually filled. Traders know this. So they won't be buying. Only stooges buy something that gaps like this which is why the stock stalled. Retail is buying, traders are out, institutions likely aren't involved.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/)\n\nOn a 4 hour this is a triple bottom. I am short AAPL for similar reasons. NVDA was more irrational because of the gap so I played AAPL instead.\n\nNVDA will likely fail the triple bottom and fill the gap. That's the trade I'd play if I weren't already playing it in AAPL and I'm also short SPY.\n\nI'm also long TLT and GLD so there's a bit of \"counter trend\" in my portfolio already so no need to go for NVDA.",

They\u2019ve had a huge FOMO run and a slight pullback is in my opinion likely due to valuation alone (I don\u2019t have any short positions though).\n\nTechnical analysis is largely nonsense imo. Not all the time but\u2026 you can analyze a chart 1000 different ways and extrapolate whatever meaning you really want.",

When you actually see them there's no doubt about them. What you marked is a \"jumbled mess\".\n\nThe head and shoulders was invalidated by today's trading.\n\nThe neckline can't be broken. The neckline would be where the vallies are making the lowest lows of the head and shoulders.\n\nThe peaks that make the shoulders have to be a certain height above the neckline - I forget what as it's generally irrelevant.\n\nAs I said before:\n\n* TA is hardly predictive, it gives guidelines on how much risk to reward and that's useful enough.\n* But TA itself is usually a 50/50 crapshoot on where it goes.",

If used properly, it can help tilt probabilities in your favor, which over time may be enough to provide a profitable strategy.\n\nThat said, one could make a case for H&amp;S pattern on NVDA 30-minute chart, but it's far from perfect. The left shoulder lasts only one day, the head two days, the right shoulder 5 days long so far.\n\nIf NVDA closes below the earnings gap 366.35 for more than a day or two then it can start to get dicey. Until then, this is not a stock I would short. It has huge institutional support, despite the fact that it is grossly overvalued.",

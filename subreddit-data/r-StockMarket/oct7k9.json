They both knew since the 70's at the latest, they both hobbled renewables (solar was going strong in the 80's until Oil got Reagan to kill the subsidy, if it were't for them we'd be 100% renewable years ago) and shifted the blame to the consumer, who has very little choice in production, so they could have giant yachts.)",

Say we got a moon base going already and a meteor kills earth, how long realistically do you think a few hundred people (generous amount) on the moon will survive? Even if they do, what does that mean? Are they going to be able to build new ships on the moon? Where does that infrastructure come from? Are all the elements required for growth and further survival going to be available on the moon? Any answer that doesn't allow for those factors is just dooming the human race anyway, its just dragging it out. I think the only true answer is generational ships and we are so far away from being able to achieve that and even then, we'd need to hedge our bets in terms of sending multiple ships to different planets.",

I highly recommend you watch this informative [video](https://youtu.be/NtQkz0aRDe8) and start at 1:38 to get a clearer picture of what will need to be done just to colonize the moon.\n\nIf we\u2019re talking about colonizing other planets like Mars then it will take double the time because of the vast distances between these planets.\n\nAnd think about it, the European kingdoms back then spent over 200 years colonizing the New World from the 1500\u2019s to the 1700\u2019s. And it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700 s that a new nation was born from that colonization.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to colonize Mars or the moon but it will definitely, absolutely 100% take more than 100 years to colonize the moon and Mars to the point where we are receiving exports of consumer goods from Mars and the Moon.",

Steam engines weren\u2019t invented until 100 years AFTER the 13 colonies were established. If we start now on colonizing Mars and it takes us 300 years and then a dark energy engine or high powered fusion engine gets invented then yeah it\u2019ll probably be a shorter time to colonize Jupiter\u2019s moons. But to travel outside the solar system going between 50%-99% the speed of light will still take thousands of years to travel across our galaxy.\n\nElon Musk said it best when he said it would probably take humanity one MILLION years to fully colonize our galaxy. Which is very reasonable IMO",

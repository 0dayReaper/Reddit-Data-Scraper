    "postText": "Hello and thanks for the advice and anything in the comments.\n\nSo basically Today I bought TSLA Calls when TSLA was at 230.10 \n\n\\- I sold for $300 profit and was happy, the sale happened around 231 I believe.\n\nIm happy I close my computer go to the gym and eat, Im at peace. However I look at close and its at 237 after hours, I sit there looking at potentially over 5k profit I could of had and Idk how to feel rn. Like dam man that's a tough one to take on the chin especially as a 20yr with 4k in the robin hood account I feel very rough right now.\n\nI know there's millions of other opportunities but how do I forget this and just be happy I took healthy profit and move on... How do I stop this from making me money hungry and chasing tomorrow?",

But you have literally no way of knowing where that bet is and when to make it.\n\nNo one knows what the stock market will do least of all investors. If you made gains know you are doing better than about 80% of retail investors. I would suggest not to shoot for the top 1% of winners as that usually just means you got lucky more than anything. Dont try to time the market. Be happy you made a good move and feel good about, never feel bad that you didn\u2019t make the perfect move (almost no one will).",

Learn to scale out of positions if you think they still have room to run.\n\nAbove all you didn\u2019t lose money so be happy about that. Work on being a consistent winner first and refining your edge (this usually takes years) Don\u2019t worry about maximizing winners. Just win.",

If it\u2019s $600, you made 50% and it wasn\u2019t excellent. \n\nBased on that, I\u2019ll say feel lucky cause you went gambling and got home with $300. It could have been $0",

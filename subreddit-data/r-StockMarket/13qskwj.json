    "postText": "Hello! \nI work at Starbucks and they give us grants every year. I login to my fidelity account and am totally lost. If I wanted to get money right now from this, would I get $1775.61, $1363.52, or $412.09?\n\nI guess I\u2019m confused about the difference between total value, total grant value, and stock plan account? \n\nAnd if I wanted to sell some shares, how would I? I literally have absolutely no clue when it comes to any of this, I just need some money right now and I know I (potentially?) have some in SBUX stock! Thanks a ton!",

Happy pay day!\n\nFeel free to come back to me if you have further questions after that.",

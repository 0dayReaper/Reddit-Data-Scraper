VT and VTI will largely overlap in terms of US exposure as well. \n\nI\u2019ll also say that if you\u2019re interested in small cap exposure in particular, it\u2019s my opinion you can do better than the Russell 2000. I like Avantis funds for their quality screens. If you are looking to invest in all equity markets with a tilt to small caps, then there are few simpler ways than to just buy AVGE. The custodial accounts I have for my kids hold just that one ETF.",

Know what you don't know and stay humble or life will almost certainly remind you of that principle in a harsh way. Be extremely skeptical of anyone, and I mean anyone, who tells you with confidence that the markets will react in any specific way. Even if you knew what the headlines would be on any given day, you have no idea how a market will react to them (even if you think you do). Keep your emotions in check, always buying low and selling high. Easier said than done. As a general rule, remember that people have a tendency to drastically overreact to both positive and negative news \u2014 don't be one of these people; always remain disciplined.\n\nAvoid credit card debt (pay them off monthly at a minimum, but I recommend doing so daily), don't ever go to law school, and invest heavily while young so that you can stop working while everyone else your age can't fathom doing so. Don't try to get rich quick; the opposite is vastly more likely to happen. The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest. Avoid hype and the subsequent, inevitable bubbles that creates \u2014 many rockets launch, but few make it to the moon and many crash and burn on their way there.\n\nI've personally ignored most of the above at various points in my life and made all of the mistakes. Hopefully after reading this you can avoid them! That said, even if you make some or all of these mistakes, I'm living proof you can adopt a new financial mindset and radically change your situation by making intelligent and reasoned short term decisions that aggregate to help build the foundation for the life you desire to have. \ud83d\ude0e",

Too many people get frozen or panic sell if they see they are down.  Buying when it is off requires great strength to go against the grain and yet it is fact of investing.  Remember this.",

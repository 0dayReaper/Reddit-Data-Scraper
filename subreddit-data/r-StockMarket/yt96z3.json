Only Elon and some insiders will have any real clue as to how the company is performing. I suspect Elon wants to promote the idea of Twitter being on the verge of bankruptcy. He'll look like a genius in a few years when financials are released for an IPO and the company is profitable.\n\nIt won't take a genius to make Twitter profitable. The company's problem has always been its bloated workforce and the billions spent on R&amp;D. What were they developing? The platform has barely changed.\n\nElon will do what he always does and make a spectacle of things. Tons of people are jumping into Twitter to watch the \"train wreak\" which will only increase the value of their ad space. Doesn't matter that some companies have pulled out, eyes balls are worth money, the ad space will be booked.\n\nThe company is operating leaner and more users are interacting with the platform. In the long run this will pay off for Twitter.",

The Russian economy is nearly 1/20th the size of the U.S. economy.  So, think about U.S. investors losing nearly $2.5 *trillion* in one day. The only reason it isn\u2019t more than that is because trading on the Russian markets has been suspended for at least the next week. Unless something drastic changes soon, their markets will reopen to a total collapse. \n\nIt very well could be 1991 2.0 and the end of Putin\u2019s rein as Russia\u2019s truly powerful seek regime change.",

                    "comment": "It's a very complex situation and I may be wrong about some or all of this, but I think these are his motives:\n\nFirst there's the economic reasons. Under the USSR, Ukraine was one of the most important food producers. Much of Russia is not usable for farmland and as it stands currently, much of Russia's food comes from foreign imports. This will allow them to lessen their reliance on the west, giving them more political freedom.\n\nUkraine has multiple ports that open directly into the Black Sea, giving Russia much more potential to totally control the area, allowing them to project their military power further south. It will also help with important trade accessibility.\n\nMuch of Europe consists of a relatively flat area that gradually fans out until you reach the Ural Mountains in Russia. A huge, flat border is very hard to defend in the event of a war with NATO. By taking Ukraine, they are significantly reducing the areas needing defending. A similar thing was achieved in the Cold War with the Warsaw Pact. I believe that if Russia succeeds, they may try to take Moldova soon after the the same reason.\n\nAnother reason, though I'm a little less sure about this one, is that it will allow them to directly threaten NATO at the Polish border.\n\nThen of course there are the ego-driven reasons. Putin seems intent on getting his name in the history books one way or another. Rebuilding the USSR would be an effective way to do so, though he obviously underestimated the global response to such ambitions.",

Putin went all-in with this and now they're sort of all-in with him because as soon as Putin's iron fist is gone, chances are the next Navalny will have overwhelming support of the people, with extra pressure from the west which will probably encourage a regime change in order to lift sanctions (those affecting the people, not the oligarchs), and the oligarchs would be screwed there as well.  \n\nSo they're sticking with with him for now but I suppose we'll see how the repression of political dissent goes once the policemen's paycheques are no longer worth anything. \n\nThere also appears to be war crimes being commited so if Putin falls, maybe the enablers could stand trial in some way?  I'm just guessing.  In any case I would think some of them are making plans to just disappear somewhere with whatever part of their fortune they can salvage.",

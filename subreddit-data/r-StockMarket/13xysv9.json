    "postText": "I'm time stamping my trade idea. It's a gentleman's bet, I got no money on it. Never financial advice, all that dumb shjt.\n\nAAPL short to $158 - $154 price target. Stop Loss = $184\n\nI won't explain my work specifically. It's rooted in linear regression and a one time framing which is a pit trading term. I doubt many here know what any of that is.\n\nBasically one time framing is a liquidity driven phenomenon as old as 1870s so ... 150+ year track record. It's defined loosely as ever bar (frame) closes higher than previously, no more than two bars close same price or lower. When it closes same price or lower it half backs.\n\nThe linear regression confirms this half back as the daily linear regression is the bottom slanted green arrow. The price is in alignment with the 200day.\n\nThe confluences are too great to ignore.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/e6EE6F4I/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/e6EE6F4I/)",

That should go without saying. But if you won't buy it now if creating a new position, then it's a sell. Because everyone else will be thinking the same thing.\n\nIf you think you're going to sell every blown-off top then you're like 99% of the rest of the investors who retire at 75 in a retirement home saying \"well the markets are hard\".\n\nI'm telling you how to make the markets easy and you flat out reject it.

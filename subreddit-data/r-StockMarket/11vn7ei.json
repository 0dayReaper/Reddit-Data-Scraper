This number is largely due to being unable to integrate 2500-5000 different ledgers into a fully accountable system of one of the biggest financial entities in the country. \n\nIronically this could be blamed on every project going out to bid and the lowest bidder getting the project in an effort to increase government accountability. Now, in their effort to be accountable, nothing is accountable. \n\nIronic.\n\nBut really any entity with 5000 accounting systems is FUCKED.\n\nEdit: here's the article where they did an audit to see how many accounting systems they had and they could only guess it was 2500-5000.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-brokenfixes-specialrepor/special-report-why-the-pentagons-accounting-fixes-end-up-broken-idUKBRE9BM0HM20131223",

There is no-one but congress with the authority to do anything different.  This is the way it HAS to be according to the rules.  Noone could reasonably bid on being ALL of the pentagons accounting software.  The bid couldn't even happen because companies would bid negative or 0 values and basically pay the government huge sums of money just to guarantee the much more lucrative future service work. The contract is so big it would have to basically go to congress, or it would never pass.  Weaponized good intentions gone so horribly horribly wrong they're blatantly incompetent in their result.  Thats government though often times.",

The taxes give the money value, and thus allow the government to spend.\n\nThe point is that the money is in the hands of the government.

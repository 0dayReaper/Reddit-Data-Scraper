Even though they're not profitable yet, the potential in this sector is immense and Immix Biopharma is staking its claim. Sometimes, it's these bold moves that pay off big time. Found an article on em that I wanted to post about and see what everyone thinks. I broke it down into a summary, some points I thought that should be highlighted and a TLDR.\n\n**Summarized Article:**\n\nImmix Biopharma is a company that's spending money to make money \u2013 in business-speak, that's called \"burning cash\". As of March 2023, they have about 17 months worth of cash left. That may seem like a lot, but in the business world, it's not that long, and people are watching to see what happens when the money runs out. The thing is, this is pretty common in the biotech sector, where companies have to spend a lot on research and development before they can make any profit.\n\n**Highlighted Main Points**\n\n* Immix Biopharma has a \"cash runway\" of 17 months, meaning it has enough cash to keep operating at its current spending rate for that long.\n* The company's cash burn rate has increased by 184% over the past year, indicating that it's investing heavily in its growth.\n* Immix Biopharma might need to issue new shares or take on debt to raise more cash for its operations, which could dilute existing shareholders' stake in the company.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nImmix Biopharma's cash burn rate is increasing, indicating heavy investment in its growth, but it has a relatively comfortable 17 months of cash runway left. However, it may need to raise more funds in the future, which could mean issuing new shares. Despite these risks, the potential upside in the biotech sector could make it all worthwhile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/think-immix-biopharma-nasdaq-immx-123147718.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/think-immix-biopharma-nasdaq-immx-123147718.html)",

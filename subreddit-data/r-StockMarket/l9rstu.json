So they have a vested interest in manipulating the market into falling prices (for example by restricting demand -buying stocks- while enabling supply -selling stocks-).",

Lets make a statement that they will regret restricting us. We arent done. AMC to the moon this week, gme still has a push but gme should start cooling down and slowly easing money into AMC.

    "postText": " \n\n&gt;Liquidity is inversely proportional to risk and liquidity is proportional to the agreed upon price.  \n**Everything must be:**\n\n* Scalable\n* Compoundable\n\nSome realities are that many trading strategies are just wrong. They are breakevens because they violate fundamental rules of how money is made. For instance:\n\nHedging doesn't work because no one is going to pay you for less risk. Two soldiers in a trench. \"Hey man I'll pay you to stay here while I go over the top and check things out.\"\n\nNothing in life work that way and neither does the market.\n\nSo hedging CANNOT make money. Its existence is a flawed concept.\n\nHedging offloads risk, you're paying someone to take risk for you which increases your liquidity because maybe you have liquidity problems.\n\nThe fact sometimes you appear to make money from a hedging trade such as buying puts lowering your cost basis on an underlying is an illusion.\n\nYou'd have just saved more money had you sold the underlying.\n\nHow to add risk to your portfolio is to be the liquidity provider. People need liquidity and you surrender some of your buying power at a premium to give them that liquidity.\n\nI'll expand on that more soon. There are specific trades at specific prices that are liquidity provisions.",

You\u2019ll make more money if things go south than the premium you paid to offload that risk, thus making it a positive hedge and not a break-even hedge. \n\nSecondly, adding risk to your portfolio is quite a loaded concept. There are so many sources of risk and reward structures, that\u2019s it\u2019s impossible to limit it to being a liquidity provider or simply a \u201clender\u201d of some sorts.\n\nLastly, what overall point are you trying to make?",

I don't disagree that you can absolutely make money doing almost anything in the market...\n\nThat's why the market is so \"hard\". People make money doing something that can absolutely not scale or compound and get blown up or reduced back to average returns. \n\nSecond I'd say the point I want to eventually make is to show how to actually evaluate risk and that risk has little to do with standard deviation and variance and beta and instead has more to do with liquidity. \n\nThird I eventually want an easy way to explain what liquidity actually is to a layperson, in a way that is practical to use because it will improve trading and investing for anyone who gets it",

It's relationship to risk to me is less interesting than price and liquidity relationships. For many years now I've seen too much that price seeks out a liquidity zone to ignore it. \n\nI feel I've found a way to generally map it for any underlying. And for some time had to work on what an appropriate position size looks like to access that liquidity zone because if you're too leveraged it can get pretty ugly and waiting for the zone to be reached can be pretty costly in time.\n\nThat is to say if you just wait for it...you probably average out to break even which is why it exists in the first place.\n\nTo consistently reach profit you have to use your excess liquidity to give to others who have too little and are willing to pay for it.\n\nThat space in price and time would be the slope of a sin wave. Not the inflection points.\n\nA lot of people try to time tops and bottoms and fail for that reason. Money is made in the slope not in the inflection points. I been through it all so been trying to explain why after surviving long enough I've found something genuinely superior to a lot of it.\n\nI don't think I'm the first or even first to try to describe it. Big money lives in the slope. I just am trying to describe it in a more practical way",

They are hedging out all the systematic/market risk and just letting their factors and idiosyncratic risk drive returns. That is true alpha. The goal is not to beat the benchmark, it's to produce uncorrelated absolute returns.\n\nRegarding your comments about providing liquidity, yes this is correct. You get rewarded for making trades that others do not want to take, which in many instances is providing liquidity at in-opportune times. This is a good way to harvest risk premia, but obviously it doesn't feel \"safe\" or \"comfortable\" to make these trades which is exactly why you get compensated for doing it.",

To pull it up by the roots, and get rid of it.\u201d\n\nIn November, John Thune, the number two Senate Republican in leadership, declared that Social Security and Medicare benefits should be slashed.\n\nFlorida Senator Rick Scott is championing a plan to put Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security on the chopping block every five years, which would put the health and economic security of 63 million Medicare beneficiaries, 69 million Medicaid beneficiaries and 65 million Social Security beneficiaries at risk. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin proposed sunsetting these laws every year.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee \u2013 which includes a majority of House Republicans \u2013 released a formal budget that, according to Politico, included \u201craising the eligibility ages for each program, along with withholding payments for individuals who retire early or had a certain income, and privatized funding for Social Security to lower income taxes.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2015, most House Republicans, including Speaker McCarthy, Rep. Scalise, and a host of others in current leadership, voted to raise the retirement age to 70, which would cut Social Security benefits for tens of millions of seniors who paid into the system for years.\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/09/fact-sheet-congressional-republicans-many-proposals-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare-and-increase-prescription-drug-prices-and-health-care-premiums/",

On the other hand, if they sent a bill to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for killing medicare, medicaide, or social security, I would side with the veto and blame congress. \n\nIf congress refused to send something to his desk it would have been the rabble rousers in congress who kept it from happening who got the blame from me. Like it really just comes down to the circumstances at the time with regards to who gets the blame, at least that's how it is for me.",

And Biden\u2019s administration spending was related to the pandemic as well so are you not taking that into account for Biden too? \n\nIf you just examine the debt before Covid in the Trump administration:\n\n\u201cWhen Trump took office in January 2017, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting that federal budget deficits would be 2% to 3% of our gross domestic product during Trump\u2019s term. Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019.\n\nThere were multiple culprits. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, especially the sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, took a big bite out of federal revenue. The CBO estimated in 2018 that the tax cut would increase deficits by about $1.9 trillion over 11 years.\n\nBy early 2019, the national debt had climbed to $22 trillion. Trump\u2019s budget proposal for 2020 called it a \u201cgrave threat to our economic and societal prosperity\u201d and asserted that the U.S. was experiencing a \u201cnational debt crisis.\u201d However, that same budget proposal included substantial growth in the national debt.\n\nBy the end of 2019, the debt had risen to $23.2 trillion and more federal officials were sounding the alarm. \u201cNot since World War II has the country seen deficits during times of low unemployment that are as large as those that we project \u2014 nor, in the past century, has it experienced large deficits for as long as we project,\u201d Phillip Swagel, director of the CBO, said in January 2020.\n\nWeeks later, COVID-19 erupted\u2026\u201d\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump/amp",

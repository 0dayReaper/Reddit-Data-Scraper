The 2 percent inflation number was never empirically or theoretically justified, it was basically just a number pulled right out of thin air by some central bankers (from Australia or around there) who were late to a meeting to fill in a slide. Long term deflation of course isn't desirable, though short term deflation can and sometimes has to happen in certain sectors if they get inflated by bubbles--when rent, housing and groceries become unaffordable such prices of basics do have to come down. \n\nHowever, the amount of \"useful\" inflation beyond stable prices has never been empirically tied to 2%. That's more of a rule of thumb lacking anything better, but traditional econ had that number at under one percent, or at least some stable number to make sure wages and cost of living stayed manageable for most Americans. In fact if wages *don't* rise with inflation (and that's a particular problem for the United States with such low unionization levels), then even relatively low levels of inflation are much more destabilizing and contribute to social unrest. (We're seeing a lot of homelessness and stores getting stolen from or shoplifted now as prices rise beyond wages) If there isn't a reliable way to raise incomes with inflation, then even modest increases in inflation beyond stable prices (ie. even below 2 percent) can cause serious trouble, and due to the severe inflation over the past 3 years, even 2% inflation in the US on top of that would be troublesome, saying the very least.",

There is no real economic reason for the US stock market to have such a massive valuation. The only thing that has it pumping is the removal of government borrowing limits. Someone is going to be left holding the bag, when the bill comes due. Buy yeah 1-2% is good. 0% would be good.

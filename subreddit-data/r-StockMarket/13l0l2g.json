P/B 1.25, debt to equity 0.87, average annual EPS over the last 3 years is $3.94, current price is 7.5x that so you're not really overpaying compared to what that share earns. It's actually a pretty healthy looking stock, and will be a huge player in chips if this whole US/China/Taiwan thing boils over",

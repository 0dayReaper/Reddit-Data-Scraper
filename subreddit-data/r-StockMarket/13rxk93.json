    "postText": " It is my personal opinion that markets are not truly \"efficient\" as we are told. I feel certain elite and high-privilege circles most probably have better inside tracks to information. I would guess these include congress (yes I know that they have to file disclosures but its usually long after their trades) and perhaps hedge funds.\n\nTo the extent this is true, can dark pools shed any light on trades worth looking at? For example, if there is enormous money flowing to any particular stock, is it worth diving deeper into that stock and, while not blindly copying the move, at least looking at it a bit further? Outside of dark pools, is there other trading activity that is hidden from the public? Is the data that is offered by paid subscriptions that shows dark pool activity even reliable and accurate? Or is some data hid from that too?",

We\u2019re relying on participants to accurately report information, the very same participants who are routinely caught and fined for being unethical and not following the rules.  One thing is for sure, you will never glean any useful information from dark pool reporting. It\u2019s ridiculous that dark pool trading is still allowed, and I hope the proposed SEC rules to bring transparency to the situation are adopted.",

But I believe volume already includes dark pool trades. \n\nI know that's not specifically what you're asking but any large money flowing into a stock should show by proxy on volume anyway regardless of what route it's taking.\n\nWhat specifically about the dark pool trade is it you'd be interested in? Who made the trade to see if some large pension fund were taking a position for example?",

ATS traffic (which is what darkpools are) must first pass through the Trade Reporting Facility (TRF) which will then pass the trade report over to the SIP (which publishes the tape). Means it\u2019s a bit latent relative to trading on the lit markets (in non-human timescales).\n\nNot all TRF volume though is the ATSs. There\u2019s also broker-to-broker negotiated trades that will present eventually on the SIP. These are often specifically listed as non-printable because they are not activity that participants in the market could have interacted with.",

Some market participants have access to what\u2019s going on there.  If there is anything compelling bullish or bearish, it will spill onto the main tape as algos or traders take advantage.  I don\u2019t think there is any edge there for retail traders/investors.  Also, I think the volume shows up at the end of the day in the public volume data.",

    "postText": "Tell me if this makes sense: I want to invest in company XYZ because I expect the company to do well for the next 10+ years. At the same time, I know that short-term volatility is a bitch.\n\nOne solution would be to just buy the stock now and hold onto it. That's how most people buy for the buy-and-hold part of the strategy.\n\nAnother idea that I was considering: what if i buy a call option for 6 or 12 months out? If the company does well, I get to pay the strike price for the stock. If it doesn't and I still feel good about the company, I can get another call option. \n\nI was wondering if this strategy is common. Does it have a name? Has anyone used this technique? If so, what was your experience like? The reason I ask is because I'm looking at my portfolio and notice big swings in different directions for stocks I've bought in the past year: +4.5%, -8%, -39%, -33%, +8%, +12%, etc. I still think each of them are going to do well for the next 10ish years so I don't intend to get rid of them. But, I could be holding the winners and just be out a little for the losers. I'm sure I'm missing a LOT. That's why I'm asking. If this was such an easy strategy, why haven't other investors been doing this for decades?",

OP was correct with protective puts. \n\n-Buying protective puts(PP) set a \"floor price\" of what you will sell for while theoretically keeping your profits unlimited(-PP premium) or  \"no ceiling\". \nExample: ABC @ 10/share x 100shares = 1,000$ invested. 9$ pp @ .5x1 purchased. Total 1050. Price rises to 11$, put expires worthless and profit is 50$. You still own 100 shares. Alternatively, price goes down to 9$. Put gets exercised @ 1$, limiting loss to 50$. 1050-(10$ strike*100shares). Doesn't get exercised, sell for @ 1 for a net gain of 50$, limiting loss to 100$ since you still have shares @ 9$ + 50net profit on option. \n\n-Selling Covered calls(CC) set a \"ceiling\" of your profits by capping gains and limiting loss. \nExample: Same stock above. You sell/write x1 $11c @ .5, collecting 50$ premium. Price goes to up but option doesnt get exercised - you keep premium +shares. Goes up ALOT ($12) and get exercised - 11/share*100 (+50$ premium)=1150. You lose 50$ technically because the price is 12/share.\n\nMarried protective puts/covered calls are essentially the same thing, just both shares and options purchased at the same date.",

Just buy it at $100. \n\nThough this point is mostly coming from you saying if they do well you can buy it at the strike. Meaning you're keeping the cash back to do that. Normally you'd do this to leverage your cash. Either investing the same amount you would buying for pure leverage or say 25% of what you would so you can spend the other 75% on other leaps. Then instead of exercising you just cash in and if you're still confident just roll it.\n\nKeeping the cash back to exercise sort of defeats the point in my opinion even if you buy ITM.",

Of course, I have never seriously looked into options prior to this idea and don't fully understand how they work, so I'm sure it DOES matter lol. I'm just saying, I don't have a preference. I'm not trying to gamble, I'm trying to maximize the upside on companies that I like while minimizing the downside.\n\nOver the past year or so, I bought CVS, UBER, VZ, and PG. They are all companies I felt would do very well for the following 10+ years. My perspective of these companies haven't changed. I still want to own them, but they are -33%, +15%, -38%, and +9% respectively. Now, had I used calls options, I would now own UBER and PG, but I wouldn't be down 33% and 38% on the other two stocks. \n\nThe way you describe it, it sounds like people use calls to leverage their bets. I don't think this is what I'm aiming for. I suppose I am doing that a little just by the nature of options. But, mostly I'm just trying to protect to the downside while still knowing I'll have the stock if it pops. If I'm not misunderstanding how options work, a 12-month call option can act like an insurance policy for the stocks I want to buy. Or am I just a dummy?",

Which yes is better in that scenario.\n\nBut if you do end up buying I still wouldn't want to buy OTM in that case as say you go 10% out.. well you're also 10% down on that position plus the price of the contract compared to if you had just purchased it.\n\nPersonally I'd probably ITM with a delta around 70%. So it's still cheaper than stock and max losses are still lower. But obviously that will cost more so if you have a reason to be very confident in the stock you could go ATM instead. \n\nBut why buy the stock? You can just cash in for the difference instead and roll if you want if you're going to continue the strategy anyway. Then you don't need to waste money keeping it back to buy. \n\nAn alternative you can do is decide what range you're happy to buy in and sell a put at the top end and buy one at the bottom end. Then you actually make money on the contract instead. But of course that's for more stable stocks because if it flies up well you didn't own it and lost out.\n\nLots of options with options. But I'd never exercise unless I was using them for insurance. I.e. just buying the stock then buying a put to cap my max losses at the strike. Which if you really want to own the stock is another option for you. To just use them as they were intended.",

The option premium is the cost of stock price volatility that may or may not happen. To profit, the price has to move more than was assumed by the volatility.\n\nThis means that even if the stock goes up a decent amount over that year, you can still lose money. \n\nFor example, let's look at the APPL Jan '25 180 call. At expiration, the breakeven price is $210. If on that day, AAPL is anywhere under $210, you lose over $3000. Holding the stock, you'd be up $3000. AAPL has to be up 17% just for you to break even. And because you're sacrificing the premium by holding to expiration, there is no point at which you profit more by exercising the option than simply holding the stock. \n\nThus, even with a long dated call, you are still counting on the stock outperforming significantly in the meantime and selling before expiration.

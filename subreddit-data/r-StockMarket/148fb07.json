Being that I\u2019m somewhat on the \u201cyounger side\u201d, I\u2019m taking an aggressive stance with my portfolio. \n\nI realize that a few things overlap: VTI, VUG etc. should I keep these holdings or cash out and diversify into something else? When I buy something, I like to commit to it and never sell but I\u2019m in it for the long game. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub for this question. If not, what community should I be asking?",

VOO isn\u2019t one holding its 500, and the same goes for a lot of your other positions. Your account is already pretty much as diversified as you can make it while keeping it all in stocks.",

You could literally sell all your VOO, SPY, (which are both S&amp;P 500) and VUG, put that money in VTI (total stock market index), and it would most likely net you about the same return. The S&amp;P 500 makes up 84% of VTI anyway. Personally, the majority of my money is in VTI, followed by VXUS, and I supplement different industries I want to go heavy in/trade with blue chip stocks. You don\u2019t necessarily have to sell to adjust your portfolio if you don\u2019t want to take tax hits/realize losses, but figure out a plan and stick to it.",

The return w/ 28 non tech blue chip stocks is more predictable.\n\nVUG has many that you already own.  It had a return of -33.15% last year. Expect more growth coming?",

You\u2019re just paying different expense ratios.\n\nVUG and QQQ very similar.\n\nVFIFX basically combines all your other ETFs. So you have an etf that reflects your ETFs.\n\nWhat you do from here depends on what your goal and interests are. Do you want to stock pick, stay in ETFs, particular sectors you\u2019re interested in?",

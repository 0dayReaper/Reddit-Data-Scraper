I put in the order to transfer 28 GME shares from Robinhood to Fidelity yesterday about 10:00 AM and those shares were transferred and in my Fidelity account in less than 24 hours from when i placed the order. I still have the .47 (half share) on Robinhood. Most of my shares are on TDA. \nI was pleasantly surprised how fast my transfer went through.",

RH is a joke, never was a real broker and actually made things worse for retail investors.  Now because nobody charges what were already puny commissions, there is more day trading, your order flow goes through Citadel and other market makers and there is less transparency.  I'd prefer to go back to my $5 per trade rather than have my order flow slowed down and sold to company I've never heard of before.",

Webulls UI on mobile is way tougher to comprehend though, however it is better than some others (TDA in specific) I like TDA for their reports and screeners... Webull has a ton of useful features as well, just understanding and getting used to where everything is is the hard part.",

Specifically, law requires brokers to keep both your cash and securities in separate accounts to those of the brokerage firm. This is the first layer of protection. The second layer is an insurance policy offered by the US govt (but only for US customers) which covers up to roughly $250,000.\n\nHowever, if you have over this amount *and* if your broker is breaking the law by mixing customer assets with firm assets, then it is feasible for the customer to suffer loss.

I wonder why so many people want to give RH their non-refundable money.\n\nGuess what, nothing bad happens when you keep using them. You buy the same stocks and options at the same prices, and your account is SPIC insured.\n\nWho cares what shady crap RH is up to, What global company do you know of hasn't done anything shady or illegal? Remember when Microsoft was put on trial for having a monopoly? Now they're bigger than ever, and nobody cares about their past.\n\nTLDR - smooth brains getting played to transfer accounts for basically no reason at all except redditt hype.",

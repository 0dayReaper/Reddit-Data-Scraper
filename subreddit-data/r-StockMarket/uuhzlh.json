We might not have cheap labor like developing markets, but China is becoming increasingly expensive and insular, and India has another two decades or so to go.",

Of course all that is priced in since it was once worth as much as ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell combines.",

It\u2019s since dropped to 90 with the market crash. \n\nSo all you\u2019ve done is prove the 1,398 was actually a pretty fair P/E for a company growing at the rate tesla was. It was growing so fast it crushed that P/E through nothing but massive growth in profits. And the growth is only going to continue for the next 5+ years so an elevated P/E makes perfect sense.

Speaking of Amazon, Amazon went public in 1994 at $1.50/ share, within months of IPO it went to its all time low of $1.32 having lost 12% since IPO. Then went up to $113 during dot com bubble in 1999. After bubble burst it went down 95%, down to $5.51 in 2001. Then rallied a few hundred percent, then fell 85%. $1,000 worth of Amazon IPO stock in 1997 would be worth over  $1million today. Investing in growth stocks is always terrifying, that\u2019s why people don\u2019t invest with margin (borrowed money), &amp; do invest for long long term, knowing almost none will be as successful as Amazon &amp; many will go bust. Amazon had a stock split in 1998, Jan 1999, &amp; Sep 1999. 3 Stock splits 2-3 yrs before the bubble burst in 2001. (That\u2019s why it makes me nervous to hear Tesla is about to do another stock split &amp; Elon selling his shares to pay taxes, &amp; selling billions worth of Tesla stock to buy Twitter, &amp; board member selling just cus, &amp; Apple coming out with a full driving car by 2025).",

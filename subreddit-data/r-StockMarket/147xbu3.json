    "postText": "Few months ago, Warren Buffet said that he had made some investments in Japan. He has been investing in few leading Japanese big corporations such as  **Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui, and Sumitomo Corp.**  This is interesting since I always read before that he suggested to invest in the heartland of the USA, and he also said the invest in SP500 with low management fee is the best way to invest. \n\nAnd today, listening to a video clip on CNBC, the analyst said that Nikkei has performed better than SP500 for the last few months, to be specific YTD SP500 is up 12% vs Japan Nikkei 24%. In the video clip, the analyst also mentioned that US will be entering a cardboard recession, so basically the layoffs/headcount reductions/hiring freeze has hit a certain sector, but it will spread out to other sectors as well. He also mentioned as some of the European countries have entered recession in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023. I remembered reading the news that Germany and UK have entered a recession, though it is a mild one. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/)\n\nTherefore, I am curious how you think about investment in Japan Nikkei. It is good for diversification standpoint, and it would be nice if the economy is indeed growing stronger than the US. \n\nThanks!",

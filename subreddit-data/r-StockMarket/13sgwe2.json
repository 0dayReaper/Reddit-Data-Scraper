    "postText": "Yesterday I was looking at the Lottery.com stock, LTRY. It was sitting around the high 20 cents low 30 cents and I saw it\u2019s peaks were in the 40 cents range all the way up to the 70 cent range, so I went ahead and bought in.\n\nTHIS MORNING, it tanks. Drops down roughly 60% down to about 10 cents and delisted. So from here, now what?\n\nDo we often see growth after a delist? From my understanding a delisted stock is just it becoming private? Are the numbers on Robinhood for price per share accurate? Does anyone here have any strong opinions on Lottery stock? Is there a website where I can see delisted stock share prices?\n\nI understand it\u2019s a really, REALLY, volatile stock and a huge loss is just part of the game. However I\u2019ve never dealt with owning a stock when it delists.\n\nDoes anyone know why it dumped so hard today? I know it\u2019s been sketchy in the past with very few workers and an odd stream of revenue, but I haven\u2019t found any news on why it would delist and tank so hard. Any help or advice would be awesome! Thank you",

People are just trying to get out while they can given the delisting.\n\nAlso, a delisting does not mean that a company is going private. The shares just trade OTC. The company does not meet the requirement to be listed on NASDAQ",

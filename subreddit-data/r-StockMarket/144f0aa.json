As far as I know, none of the larger charging station offerings are as flexible for rural areas, farmers with Deere and other electric tractors and equipment, and things like National and State Parks.  They have the California State Parks as a customer.\n\nThey can deliver a truckload of equipment to a small parking lot and set it up in one day without any engineering and without losing a parking space.  It could be miles from the electrical grid.  It is solar with no batteries (though batteries may be in the future).",

Also, they have patent protection that others would have to license or get around by investing in R&amp;D.  They can deliver and install a unit in one day for about the cost of engineering for a competitor's unit.",

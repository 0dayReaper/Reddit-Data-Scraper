Because if you don\u2019t have the time needed for studying in detail and following companies and their fundamentals, you better just drop all of them and allocate all your capital in the S&amp;P500 (that, by the way, performs better than VTI.. and VTI holdings are about 80% S&amp;P500 holdings anyway..) I would just dollar cost average SPY or VOO (VOO has a lower expense ratio) and you have about 10% average annually, without even caring about what the stock market is doing",

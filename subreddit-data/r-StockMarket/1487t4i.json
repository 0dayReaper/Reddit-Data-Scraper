    "postText": "Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood is known for investing in disruptive innovation. The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.\n\nSpeaking of AI stocks, it\u2019s hard to ignore what **Nvidia Corp.** ($NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 165% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation at one point.\n\nArk Invest\u2019s flagship fund **Ark Innovation ETF** ($ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia \u201cwill do well over time.\u201d But she sees a new group of stocks that will \u201cbenefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid.\u201d\n\nThe keyword is software.\n\n\u201cIn our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS \\[software as a service\\] providers will generate $8 in revenue,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it.\u201d\n\nThe super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here\u2019s a look at the trio and another company she calls \u201cthe biggest artificial intelligence play.\u201d\n\n## UiPath Inc. ($PATH)\n\nUiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the company\u2019s revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.\n\nThe stock has surged 47% year to date, but it hasn\u2019t always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.\n\nWood\u2019s Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,865,375 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $517.28 million, UiPath is the fourth-largest holding at Ark.\n\n## Twilio Inc. ($TWLO)\n\nTwilio\u2019s cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.\n\nIn the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.\n\nIn its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence \u201cwill be a material accelerant over time for Twilio\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nArk Innovation ETF holds 4,680,705 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $303.54 million.\n\n## Teladoc Health Inc. ($TDOC)\n\nWood\u2019s flagship fund also owns $301.07 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.\n\nThe company\u2019s platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.\n\nAt the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.\n\nIn 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.\n\nWhile the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc\u2019s first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.\n\nThe stock, however, wasn\u2019t able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $24.30 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ark-invests-cathie-wood-betting-162436150.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ark-invests-cathie-wood-betting-162436150.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

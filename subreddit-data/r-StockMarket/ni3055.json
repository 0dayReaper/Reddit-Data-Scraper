We saw what happened with those using Puts--couldn't have happened to a better set of people.  Shoulda sold short 1000 AMC at 14 and covered it at 12.5.  But there are other ways to make money from more deserving people.  Someone bot 50 GME from me at 227--I covered for him 5 days later at 195.  Buying GME at 227 is ridiculous--the floor is 157 right now.  Next earnings statement is around June 8-I need entertainment that day..",

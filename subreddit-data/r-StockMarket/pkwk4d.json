You only had one choice of carrier (AT&amp;T) that required an expensive plan ($85/month for each line IIRC). And it wasn't clear that consumers would pony up $500 for a phone when they were used to paying $200 or less.

Microsoft had always been the bad apple (pardon the pun) in that area and were always slated for it by the open source community. And Apple came along with something with an even higher wall, but the garden of eden behind those walls. Master stroke. Windows Phone wasn\u2019t even bad, but getting developers to make the apps for it, which Microsoft threw money at, was painfully slow. In the end, that was what killed Windows Phone.",

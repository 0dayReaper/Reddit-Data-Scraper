Yes, trump is a corrupt and awful person. But no way he'd get away with everything that's gone down since day one if the admin and senate didn't support and protect him - rather than uphold their moral/ethical duties to the constitution and people of this country.",

It is a type of\u00a0political repression, and one of the means which is used to\u00a0politically cleanse populations, with another means being\u00a0forced migration. It may be compared to\u00a0genocide\u00a0or\u00a0ethnic cleansing, both of which involve the killing of people based on their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group rather than their adherence to a particular political\u00a0ideology. Social scientists\u00a0Barbara Harff\u00a0and Ted R. Gurr both use the term politicide to describe the killing of groups of people who are targeted not because of their shared ethnic or communal traits (the types of groups which are covered by the\u00a0CPPCG), but because of \"their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups.\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politicide\n\n*Like genocide and ethnic cleansing, politicide is classified as a crime against humanity.",

It's crippling not just for social mobility, but overall economic productivity, like we're seeing right now with the rich hoarding their wealth and demanding bailouts, while the rest of us face eviction, illness, and even death ...just so they don't have to pay a few more dollars in taxes. *Thanks, GOP, Fox News!*",

Trump and friends obviously know nothing about dealing with a pandemic, of course, but as a President you have access to the top experts in the world. He could have let them handle it and just got out of the fucking way, and be sitting at 50% approval right now. \n\nGranted, I would still oppose him and vote against him. But the \"rally around the flag\" effect is real. Look at GWB after 9/11. All he had to do was stand on some rubble and display the most basic empathy and he soared to 86% approval (though I wasn\u2019t one of them, since I never did subscribe to supply-side economics). \n\nBut Trump can\u2019t not be Trump. He has to self-sabotage anything that comes his way. This is why when people talk about the polls and say it\u2019s too early and he could still turn it around, I remain skeptical. He would need something truly outrageous to happen for a boost now, like a UFO invasion. But we saw how he handled a global pandemic so it\u2019s a safe bet he\u2019d fuck that up too. I can just hear him saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Galactic Emperor Glurg, and he assures me his people are not harvesting Americans to eat as food, despite what the fake news media is reporting.\u201d",

Either he was actively trying to sabotage his reputation, or he's so fundamentally self obsessed and idiotic that he truly believed everything he spouted. And I think we all know it's the latter. Had he handled the response to this virus responsibly, I think it's safe to say that his election would have been secured. But Trump couldn't stand the answers coming from someone else, because that implies that he doesn't have all of the answers so someone else is smarter than he is. And rather than take advice from professionals, he just shouted it all as fake news. \n\nI won't be able to fully relax until he's out of the WH, but I'm feeling pretty confident that he's going to get destroyed come November. I've lost a lot of faith in the US, but not all. But if he does get re-elected... That small bit of faith will be gone. People joked about moving to different countries when he first got elected, but if he gets elected again, then as soon as it's possible I am gone.",

Special agents with the FBI\u2019s public corruption squad began questioning witnesses this week, according to sources, zeroing in on whether the payments constitute bribes in exchange for securing permits or other favors from the mayor for Location Ventures\u2019 mixed-use project in Coconut Grove.\n&gt; \n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article276193691.html",

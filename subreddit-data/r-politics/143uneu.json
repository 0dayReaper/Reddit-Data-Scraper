Conservative political thought it not moving forward, it is rocking backwards, stuck.  Imagine a truck with big splashy wheels stuck in the mud, digging itself deeper into the muck and mud.  It rocks backwards and then rolls back to it's initial spot but only deeper. It can get unstuck with the help of others pulling it out of the mud.  The thing is, the truck driver has to allow the tow cable to be put on the front. Many conservatives are too proud and stuck in their old ways to except help from someone ahead of them because of their foolish pride. So they stay stuck in the mud.  For conservatives and especially right wing states like WV, AL, MS, SC, ID, etc they stay stuck for decades.  They then blame identify politics on the reasons why they are stuck.  It's not our fault, it's the (Insert minority group of the moment).",

And he's going to be able to weather that for a while.\n\nWhy wouldn't the Dems vote to remove him?  Because it's the wrong message.  He just helped avert default by making major compromises and being bipartisan.  Turning around and using the first opportunity to remove him is backstabbing on that effort.  Dems do that and the next GOP Speaker will be one who, in the events a week ago, wouldn't compromise to avoid a default.\n\nKeeping McCarthy around and struggling for control as long as possible is in the Dems best interests.  They just have to tell the press that it's \"The GOP majority's fight, let them vote on removal if they want it done.\"  Then they sit back and eat popcorn.\n\nThe longer this goes on with him in charge and incapable of leading, the better it is for the Dems.  Because it always ends with him resigning/removed and GOP eventually going through enough voting rounds to put someone else in that seat, someone worse, and then focusing back on being performative and fighting Dems.  The longer that takes to get to that eventuality, the better.\n\nIn the end, he'd resign if it became apparent that even his most ardent supporters were going to vote to remove (and they'd tell him beforehand), rather than be removed.",

The House and Senate would both be struggles for Dems to pass anything unilaterally -  Manchin and Sinema's stances have seen to that in the Senate.\n\nThey would be on blast from the Right for having the White House, Speakership, and a majority in the Senate, but not being able to get anything done.  That just hurts them in 2024.  They need more seats to make anything happen but that's not how the public would view it.\n\nThe simple fact is that bipartisanship is the only way must pass stuff is going to pass, Speakership or not.  And otherwise the chamber will be fairly useless with this divide.  They can't simply depend upon absences to pass legislation.\n\nThe risks of removing McCarthy are too great (if the GOP puts an even further right person in to appease the Freedom Caucus), all for a Speakership that would require the majority to be not present to even vote in the Speaker, and continue to need that to pass most anything.",

They sit on their hands and tell reporters that it's a \"GOP Speaker, GOP majority that installed him, let them fight it out.\"\n\nThe far right KNOWS this is the case and that's why they *haven't* called for a vote to remove him.  They don't have the votes unless Dems vote to remove him as well - the GOP would have to nearly unanimously vote to remove him.  But he has too many of the GOP in the House behind him, and there's going to be a lot of political pressure put on those 11 members of the GOP causing this trouble.\n\nThey know they can't remove him, and that attempting and failing would erode their own power a lot.  So they're playing stupid games that puts them in the spotlight instead of highlighting, with a removal vote, how most of the House is behind him still.\n\nThey'll play their games but eventually the news will cycle and they'll quiet down - especially as the pressure mounts from the donors to stop infighting and get back to performative politics against the Dems.  Because that's all most anything in the House is for the next 18 months, a performance for the polls.  If they keep infighting, it hurts them in 2024.\n\nIf it went on too long, he'd be forced to resign once his most ardent supports told him they were willing to vote to remove.  And, likely, that's how this all ends for his Speakership, but we're a long way from there.",

The younger generations are tired of school shootings, an economic system rigged against them, and a general culture which embraces self-satisfied cruelty.\nThe final legacy of the boomer generation will be them crying out in rage when the liberals take control nearly everywhere, screaming dire warnings that everything the left wants to do will ruin the country, dying angry and ignored, and being studied by future historians trying to understand how an entire generation of people got to be so selfish, spoiled, ignorant, and shortsighted.",

I remain hopeful that, for those independents who voted for Trump, his presidency served as a vaccine of sorts against voting for openly corrupt authoritarian fascists. I know his base still loves him. There are folks in his base who could watch Trump personally murder their kids and still vote for him the next day, certain that he must have had a good reason. But I am hopeful that those who had been merely fed up with the tendency towards analysis-to-the-point-it-becomes-indistinguishable-from-inaction from the democratic party, I am hopeful most of those folks are seeing that the alternative to democratic leadership is nothing but trainwrecks, both figurative and literal.\n\nWe'll see.",

They think that paralyzing Congress and creating chaos are good policies that will somehow help them in their fight to destroy democracy. In the end, though, that particular stance will bite them in the ass. As their constiuents will soon be tired of their antics and vote them out of office.",

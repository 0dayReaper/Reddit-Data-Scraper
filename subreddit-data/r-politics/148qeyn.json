Been seeing shit about jury nullification and posts/memes like \"IT TAKES ALL 12\" and instructions on how to answer if called for jury duty so they aren't disqualified for a few days now.",

The centerpiece will be \u201cjury nullification\u201d as alluded by item 5. The only way trump gets a hung jury (and thus what trump can spin as \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d) is if a true MAGA (or low-information \u201ccentrist\u201d that gets flipped to MAGa by the trial) gets on the jury.",

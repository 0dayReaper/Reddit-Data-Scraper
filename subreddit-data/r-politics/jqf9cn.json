When pressed most lower and middle class white people will agree that the concept of white privilege exists if you never used the word white privilege. They don\u2019t feel privileged so they balk at the term. \n\nEDIT:Hell, the spokesman for White Middle America in the Obama Years, Bill O\u2019Reily, [once conceded to John Stewart that the concept is valid](https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/16/6987475/jon-stewart-bill-oreilly-white-privilege), he just didn\u2019t like the term. \n\nBlack Lives Matter is another one that was so easily countered with \u201call lives matter\u201d I agree with the BLM movement. And I think they\u2019ve made great strides in the last year explaining that the term isn\u2019t anti white. But when they started it was very easy to paint them as anti white and the same people who don\u2019t feel privileged balked at the idea when, if you talk to them about BLMs ideas without mentioning BLM, many agree. \n\nDefund the police is easily countered because it sounds crazy extreme to people who, mostly, trust the police. But again, when pressed with the ideas of the movement, many agree that redeploying and updating/changing policing would be a good thing. \n\nThe left needs to market itself better. Their ideas are crazy popular. Faux News showed their poll results that nearly 70% of respondents want left wing policies when presented with a choice.",

Essentially, show them how we can do better without making them feel like they are giving up their values. One strategy for doing this is sympathizing with the fact that police officers are asked to do too much: we ask them to not only investigate and address crimes, but also put them as the first line of defense against social issues in our society (e.g., addiction, homelessness, severe mental illness) whereas they are not equipped professionals prepared to address these kinds of complicated issues. We can then suggest that professionals who do have that training may be better equipped to take over many of these kinds of interventions.\n\nUltimately, though, a challenge to that is that even if we reallocate resources, systemic racism will still be prevalent in policing--these strategies address but don't eliminate the problem. Accountability for racist structures and practices is going to be the only thing that rids policing of that ill.",

The majority of those transplants came from places outside of the South.\n\nAtlanta is changing, the state is changing. There's an established political machine here that disenfranchises blacks and uses gerrymandering to control the legislatures, but I really think this could be the end of red Georgia, so long as the economic opportunities here that have made it such a magnet city don't get grossly mismanaged by Democrats, who honestly put a lot of their states deep in debt without even helping the people they claim to be fighting for",

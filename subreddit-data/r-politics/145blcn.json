As long as Russia needs fund for it's boondoggle in Ukraine it's going to be pushing out as much oil as possible at discounted rates to India and China, two of the largest importers. The cartel can't cartel effectively under that circumstance.",

Been winning so much I'm tired of it. \n\nThis on top of the fact that $3.50/gallon is the new normal now.

In the context of children, there are only two common uses of the word : preying on them literally (ie. to kill them) and preying on them sexually. The second is more common than the first.\n\nApparently, you now claim you didn't mean either. Okay, but it is not the fault of other people if you use a word in a non-standard way. After all, if I said someone was a \"child predator\", would you think they hunt children to kill them, try to convince children they're a different gender or try to sexually assault children?",

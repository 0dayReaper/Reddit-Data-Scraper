It is *the intended* mechanism to deal with Constitutional concerns or changes. Not the Judiciary or the Executive, but the Legislature.    \n \nMy personal opinion is that such an effort is dead in the water considering **current** politics.      \n\nThat *could* change in the future like you say. I just don't think the Nation will depolarize enough for that anytime soon.      \n\nI see enough Gen Z getting into guns to not be too concerned about a massive generational shift there. The CoD - Gun range pipeline is still in full flow. The Boomer Fudds are dying out though, and the new blood coming up has no love affair with antique wood and steel - it's all ARs, AKs, MP7s and similar modern guns. AWBs in particular will likely struggle harder than ever to get enough support going forward. Pew polling on the topic seems to suggest that already happening.\n\nBut back to your point about politics changing with the times.        \n\nAt one point politics made it possible to prohibit alcohol through an amendment.         \nThirteen years later politics had changed enough to undo prohibition through another amendment. Considering the bar to clear, that was a sea change in politics.     \n\nIn 1994 there was just about enough political juice in the tank to pass the AWB for a ten year duration.       \nBy 2004 there wasn't remotely enough to renew it for another 10 years or make it permanent. \n\nThere hasn't been enough political juice in the tank to make a proper go at passing it again since. But to be fair, there also has not been enough juice in the tank to roll back the NFA either. So in this matter we are near deadlocked politically. Not enough to swing things decisively one way or the other.       \n\nPublic opinion does indeed change, and not always in the direction some people want it to. Maybe this next time that'll be me. Maybe it'll be You.\n\nLet Gavin try his luck, we'll see if it holds or folds.",

You must look at the definition at the time of ratification.\n\nThe following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n\n1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n\n1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n\n1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n\n1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n\n1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n\n1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n\nThe phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. \n\nThis is confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n &gt; 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2\u201353.\n\n &gt;     (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n\n &gt;     (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n\n&gt;       (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n\n &gt;     (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n\n&gt;      (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.",

The intent was to codify the preexisting right to keep and bear arms and forbid the government from regulating arms.\n\n&gt;Like, what action should be taken when there's no regulation to the necessary militia?\n\nOffering training and selling military arms to The People. Well regulated meant well equipped and properly functioning. The government is forbidden from regulating or restricting The People from keeping and bearing arms.\n\nThe Framers expected your parents to teach you.\n\n&gt;\u201cA militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves\u2026and include, according to the past and general usage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms\u2026 \"To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.\"\n- Richard Henry Lee, Federal Farmer No. 18, January 25, 1782\n\n&gt;\"[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\"\n- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28, January 10, 1788",

                    "comment": "&gt;It's in there already:\n&gt;\n&gt;\"well regulated\"\n\nThis is a common misconception so I can understand the confusion around it.\n\nYou're referencing the prefatory clause (A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State), which is merely a stated reason and is not actionable. \n\nThe operative clause, on the other hand, is the actionable part of the amendment (the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed).\n\nWell regulated does NOT mean government oversight. You must look at the definition at the time of ratification.\n\nThe following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n\n1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n\n1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n\n1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n\n1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n\n1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n\n1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n\nThe phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. \n\nThis is confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n &gt; 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2\u201353.\n\n &gt;     (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n\n &gt;     (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n\n&gt;       (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n\n &gt;     (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n\n&gt;      (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.",

                    "comment": "&gt; This is a direct result of their unwillingness to come to the table in the last 3-4 decades.\n\nLet's examine this claim for a moment. Four decades ago would be 1983. In 1986, the [machine gun registry was closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act#Ban_on_new_automatic_firearms), effectively banning machine guns from average gun owners. \n\nIf we examine your claim for three decades, it would be 1993. The 1990's had several huge gun control laws that you may have heard of. All of them had buy-in from gun owners at one level or another.\n\nFirst, we have the [1994 Brady Background Check bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act). This may be familiar to you as the law that established the NICS background check system and mandated background checks at gun stores. It was passed with the support of the NRA, and the compromise to get it passed was that private sales would be exempt from the system as Democrats didn't want to allow ordinary citizens to access the system and limited access to gun stores only.\n\nAnd then we had the [1994 Assault Weapon Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban). This was passed with the compromise that it would be in place for ten years and then we would examine the results and pass it again in 2004 if it had merit.\n\nIn 2013, Republicans proposed the [Coburn Amendment](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/18/177825289/coburn-proposal-would-make-buyer-prove-ability-to-buy-guns) as a response to the [Manchin-Toomey Universal Background Check bill](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/04/10/176779165/friends-and-neighbors-exception-part-of-deal-on-gun-checks). It was killed in committee by Harry Reid (D). If you're confused about what that means, let me translate it. We would have universal background checks today but for the Democrats' stubbornness and belief in their ability to ram through their proposal.\n\nThe only common theme in the last 4 decades of gun control is Democrats either refusing to compromise with gun owners or reneging on their compromises. In light of that, gun owners stopped coming to the table.",

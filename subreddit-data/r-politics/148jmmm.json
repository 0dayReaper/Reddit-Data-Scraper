The GOP turns around and says the Dems are evil, woke, and trying to destroy democracy.\n\nThis was the crux of what I was going after.  The Democratic Party can't make any meaningful progress in legislation when even solidly moderate policy they propose has be defended against accusations fabricated simply for the sake of making a scene.  This also poisons any serious debate that would result in more solidly built legislation:  it's hard to talk about the economic impacts of an agriculture policy after you just had to spend all day explaining that a certain safety regulation regarding animal handling doesn't cause women to have abortions.\n\nDemocrats do not want this situation to exist.  They'd much prefer a rational conservative party that doesn't make up bullshit to get people hot and bothered and pretend it is normal politics.  \n\nThe reason this situation does exist is because the Constitution was not amended in time to address the major changes in our political landscape that came with mass media and easy access to transportation.  The Constitutional protections intended to protect individual states from being bullied by the majority have now been used to create a bloc entity for the GOP that is able to impose its will upon a majority of the US population that does not want the GOP in charge.  \n\nThis is why I am quite terse when I see \"both sides\" crap.  Only one side has been opaquely manipulating our political system in a way that the Constitution never intended, and saying that the Democratic Party wishes for the situation that exists only to hurt them to continue is crap.",

It's up to potential candidates to make their own decision to run.  The \"reasonable alternatives\" have all decided not to because 1) they would not win the nomination  2) their efforts would be a waste of time and resources and 3) any effort would undermine the chances for the eventual nominee (Biden).\n\nSo what we have currently is Biden and a handful of misfits like Steve Bannon's RFK Jr.",

And this is the problem with the neo liberals in the Dem party. They sit there and have a good chortle over someone like MTG thinking her stupidity is her weakness. But they don't understand her base. I don't think many of these chortling democrats understand how much power MTG has managed to grab within her party.\n\nHow many people here in 2015-2016 thought Trump didn't have a chance?\n\nThere's far too many people in the Democratic Party who just refuse to acknowledge potential problems. Trump should have been taken out in the primary. I think the Pussy Grabbing Tape if released before it came down to Cruz and Trump that would have ended Trump then and there. Why? Because at that point Republicans had plenty of people to hang their hat on. by the time the tape came out Trump was their only option against Hillary\n\nRFK Jr is gaining ground. And it's clear he is because you compare him to Marianne Williamson you're not seeing the same buzz. Now I get the media doesn't like Marianne Williamson she would make the rich and corporations pay their fair share in taxes. That's the biggest sin a politician can make. But RFK Jr doesn't inherently appeal to the media either they could just as easily ignore him too. Biden is after all the perfect candidate for the wealthy and corporations. He'll do all the things Republicans would do economically but without the hate and bigotry.\n\nSo here is RFK Jr who is appealing to the \"celebrity left\". That is helping grow his profile. And i know many of the knee jerk reactions will be \"no nuh it's not a concern\" but the concern isn't that RFK Jr will win the primary necessarily. But I will say the buzz around RFK Jr's candidacy is a concern.",

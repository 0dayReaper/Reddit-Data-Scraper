[But according to their part 6 of the latest version of their TOS](https://legal.parler.com/documents/useragreement.pdf) states that you must submit a SSN and/or tax Identification number if you want to redeem Virtual Items for cash. \n\nWith that being said, this section under their [private policy](https://legal.parler.com/documents/privacypolicy.pdf) is gold:\n\n&gt; Information We Collect\n&gt; \n&gt; We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various\n&gt; sources, as described below.\n&gt; \n&gt; A. Information You Provide to Us.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Registration and Profile Information**. When you sign up for an account, we may collect\n&gt; information such as your name, email address, display name, and profile photo.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **Verification Information.** If you choose to go through the verification process, we may ask for\n&gt; information that can be used to verify your identity, such as scans of your government-issued\n&gt; photo identification. When your government-issued photo identification information is no\n&gt; longer necessary to verify your identity, we delete the scans (front and back). We retain only an anonymized hash corresponding to the information the identification document contains, in\n&gt; order to prevent identity theft and impostor accounts. No personally identifiable information\n&gt; from your identification document can be retrieved from the stored hash. In addition to the\n&gt; identification information, we ask for you to take a selfie. We retain the selfie to prevent the\n&gt; creation of impostor accounts, but we store them securely, in encrypted form.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Influencer Network Information.** Unlike other platforms, Parler allows you to monetize your\n&gt; content, following, and goodwill. As part of that, the law requires us to collect certain pieces of\n&gt; personally identifiable information. Specifically, in addition to identification information (see\n&gt; above under \u201cverification\u201d for our collection and treatment of identifying information), we\n&gt; collect information on form W-9 as required by the IRS. We are required to do this in order to\n&gt; facilitate the receipt by you of payments earned on Parler. However, we store that information\n&gt; in secure, encrypted form. We never share it, sell it, or use it in any way other than for purposes\n&gt; of legal compliance.\n\nEdit 2: Alright, final edit of the night for me but there is just one more thing that I've found in their private policy which is just. ['Chief kiss' perfection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1UtRnGn5hc) \n\nFrom their private policy under the section called \"How We Share the Information We Collect\" we have this gem:\n\n&gt; **As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.** We may access, preserve, and disclose your\n&gt; information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law\n&gt; enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your\n&gt; requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of\n&gt; doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or\n&gt; through our Services.",

A private entity like reddit, Twitter or Facebook has no requirement to give anyone a soapbox, or allow any speech they do not approve of to remain on their platform.\n\nThe first amendment also doesn\u2019t protect you from the social consequences of your speech. If you shout threats at your employer you can and will be fired. If you shout racial slurs in a restaurant you can be kicked out. If you say offensive things to someone on the bus then everyone is allowed to think you\u2019re an asshole.\n\nThe first amendment also isn\u2019t absolute. There are several exceptions to your first amendment protection, including but not limited to \u201cincitement\u201d (compelling people to commit a crime...like raiding the U.S. Capitol building), false statements of fact, obscenity, and transmitting threats.\n\nMany things written online would fail to qualify as free speech under all of these conditions. And always remember, just because you can say something doesn\u2019t mean you should. Just because something needs to be said doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said by you. And just because something needs to be said by you doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said right now. Try not to be assholes to one another.",

They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\u201d\nShortly thereafter, the President tweeted:\n\u201cTo all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\u201d\nDue to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President\u2019s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks. After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.\nAssessment\nWe assessed the two Tweets referenced above under our Glorification of Violence policy, which aims to prevent the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts and determined that they were highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nThis determination is based on a number of factors, including:\nPresident Trump\u2019s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an \u201corderly transition\u201d on January 20th.\nThe second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a \u201csafe\u201d target, as he will not be attending\n\n\nThe second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a \u201csafe\u201d target, as he will not be attending\n\nThis is chilling as fuck.

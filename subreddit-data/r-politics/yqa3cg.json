The Dems are somehow managing to hold seats that were expected to go Republican, the Dems have gained some seats, and Republicans are doing much worse than expected. The Dems might hold the Senate and have made the House too close to call. This should've been unthinkable.\n\nSome Trump-backed big name candidates are struggling too. Mastriano lost the Governor's race and is refusing to concede. Oz lost his senate race. Kari Lake is losing pretty badly in Arizona and is pushing election conspiracies. While non-backed Trump candidates did well eg. De Santis in Florida and Kemp in Georgia.",

It is the people who must protect democracy and freedom above all, even if our institutions fail. The Supreme Court is still stacked illegitimately. \n\nWe must remain vigilant. We must not forget that politics cannot be turned off for so many that the democrats are allies towards (due to race, sexuality, relationships, gender, identity, and so much more). We must not forget that the past eight years since Trump picked up his vulgar campaigns has exposed the rot in our country and the outright danger these groups that cannot turn off politics are in from their own neighbors. KKK resurgences in rural communities, nazi proud boy torch marches, protestors being plowed through where a woman was killed, violences against people specifically targetted for their race, immigration status, sexuality, or religion. And of course January 6th.\n\nWe must never forget if we want our country to withstand the next two decades, let alone trying to envision it in the next century.",

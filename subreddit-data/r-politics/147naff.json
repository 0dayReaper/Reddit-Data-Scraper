This is absurd for a lot of reasons (the primary one being why the *hell* would you want to automatically declassify things like the US's military vulnerabilities) but it's also irrelevant. Under the Espionage Act, all the prosecutors have to prove is that the documents contained national defense information - their classification status is moot. In fact, the Espionage Act predates the modern classification system entirely.\n\nSo, they can whine about the status of the documents until blue in the face and it won't make a difference with the charges the orange shitgibbon is facing. They instead need to argue that documents detailing US vulnerabilities and attack responses are somehow *not* national defense documents, and good luck with that. The hurdle this presents might be why he lost his legal team and is struggling to find a replacement. This could also just be a delay tactic - thinking they can't have a trial until he has lawyers. But fuck that, they should just give him a public defender if he can't find a new team.",

Under the Constitution, the president\u2019s clemency power extends to all federal criminal offenses \u2013 except impeachment. (It should be noted that the president\u2019s clemency power does not extend to a civil, state, or local offense. This begs the question of whether a Presidential pardon means that the recipient is acknowledging that he or she is guilty of their original charge(s).\n\n&gt;In the 1833 case of\u00a0United States v.\u00a0Wilson, the Supreme Court ruled that a pardon could be rejected by the convict. Due to the findings in the 1925 case,\u00a0Burdick v. United States, it seems as though accepting a pardon is, in fact, admitting guilt. In\u00a0Burdick\u00a0the appellant was offered a pardon but declined it, also refusing to testify in criminal court. The opinion of the case given by the justices seemed to uncover that 1) a pardon can be given before a conviction and sentence; 2) a pardon can be refused, and 3) acceptance of a pardon implies acceptance of guilt.\u00a0",

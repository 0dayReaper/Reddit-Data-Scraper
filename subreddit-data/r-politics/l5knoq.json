Biden's platform wasn't as ambitious as some others, but it was always a true representation of his administration.\n\nThere exists a space in between Joe Manchin and Bernie Sanders, where center-left politicians make progress and right injustices and improve society without necessarily addressing the base causes of the country's ills with sweeping transformative change. And there are legitimately people, like Joe Biden, who do truly believe in that philosophy and are going to follow through given power. \n\nIt's not my first choice, but it's a hell of a lot better world to live in than the one we've had for the last 4 years. I don't know whether the people who spent a year demonizing Biden are accelerationists, obstinate, or intentionally trying to eliminate the center-left to poison pill Democratic primary voters to accept their candidates because they aren't compelling enough on their own. Regardless, Biden is going to keep following through on promises.",

Who could care if he did X because by the time you learn about it Y already happened and Z is currently going on?",

I dont typically share the story but I will because I think it matters. \n\nMy husband had a cousin who was a heroin addict. He had recently had a brain surgery and had been prescribed pain pills. She called him once, crying, saying that she was withdrawing and begged him to help her. So he did. - sidenote, he had his concealed carry permit and a gun on him when he met up with her. \n\nWhat he didn't know was that she had just been busted for heroin and had offered to become a CI to avoid jail. She was wearing a wire when he met with her. He sold her 6 of his pills. Yes, that was a crime and he has never tried to deny that, but he felt bad for his cousin. \n\nFast forward... He was arrested by the feds (having the gun on him made it a federal crime). Mandatory minimum of 5 years, no exceptions. Plus 21 months for distribution of oxycodone. \n\nMy husband, who was not a drug dealer, had zero criminal history (not so much as a speeding ticket), and was a hardworking family man received 81 months in prison (fed time requires you do 85% before release). \n\nHe sold his cousin 6 pills, 1 time, and went to prison for 5 and a half years, and will be on paper for 6 years. That is our current criminal justice system. \n\nSome will probably say that he got what he deserved, and they are absolutely entitled to that opinion. Although.. Someone can be convicted of voluntary manslaughter and be out in 2 years.",

I'm truly sorry sir\"\n\nLook, I am in no way advocating for it, but when you hear a judge say something like this, it starts to make sense why so many people resort to riots and violence in defiance of our criminal justice system.\n\nThink about it. It's part of the criminal justice system for a judge to explain that they don't think you deserve the punishment they are giving, yet they are going to give that punishment anyways and there's nothing you can do about it. A piece of paper determines your fate, not the person in the chair whos job it is to judge you. \n\nAgain, not advocating for anything, but god damn it's hard to say the riots in the summer were in any way wrong.",

They just straight up neglected her and treated her scornfully. She lay there dead for hours. Medication assisted treatment should be easier to get than street stuff.

I've seen women who've had mastectomies refused meds, hip surgery with only Tylenol, etc. It's gotten to the point where people are having liver issues because too much Tylenol-type pills are toxic. The doctors are scared to rx because the Feds are coming after them. Only now are some pushing back, they're starting to realize they went too far and millions of people are needlessly suffering. OD's haven't gone down, they're probably up as people turn to 'alternative' procurement methods. Then get busted by over-zealous cops and sentenced to ridiculous terms in prison. It's messed up.

The system is set up to incarcerate, which has major ramifications for even those that get out (such as 10+% of Florida\u2019s electorate being felony disenfranchised (nonviolent drug possession can be a felony) in 2016, over 6 million disenfranchised across the states).\n\nThere has been a 500% increase in the prison population over the last 40 years, while US general pop has risen ~40%. All evidence shows that the bulk of this change is not due to any change in crime, but to changes in law.\n\n&gt;\tSince the official beginning of the War on Drugs in the 1980s, the number of people incarcerated for drug offenses in the U.S. skyrocketed from 40,900 in 1980 to 452,964 in 2017. Today, there are more people behind bars for a drug offense than the number of people who were in prison or jail for any crime in 1980. The number of people sentenced to prison for property and violent crimes has also increased even during periods when crime rates have declined.\n\nhttps://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/",

For a country that can't go 2 seconds without changing about freedom, or bragging about being free or bitching about their freedom being taken away sure don't seem to think other people's freedom matter. Prison is punishment by taking freedom away. If anyone's ever been kept in one place, forced on someone else's schedule, not being able to decide what to do or where to go, you would know that having that done is incredibly punishing. People bitching about being locked down at home, imagine that times ten for years at a time.\n\nThese people are in prison, and making it a horrible experience doesn't make anyone better. That's what prison is, seperation from society, but what happens till they leave? It's supposed to be a place where rehabilitation can and should take place, but making every minute excessively painful on some misguided assumption that just being locked up is not enough. These people have to be helped, otherwise you're just releasing better criminals, and you don't help someone by being someone they need to resist.",

They'll say \"Look at these moron Republicans who want fewer abortions but oppose birth control and support abstinence-only education.\" Or \"Look at these hypocritical 'pro-life' activists who don't care about children in cages.\" And you know what, I think they have a *great* point on both of those, and there are plenty of people who exhibit the stupid behavior they describe. But guess what - I'm pro-birth control, I hate the detention centers (I'm quite pro-immigration), but I *still* think second and third trimester abortion should almost always be illegal. I agree with how poorly the mainstream Republican party approaches the issue of abortion, but I'll never agree with the Democrats on it either. It's that way on a bunch of issues.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do? Fundamentally I agree with many (this has gotten a little hazier under Trump) GOP positions, but I desire a much more moderate approach both policy-wise and rhetorically. Not to speak for Romney, but I imagine it's the same dilemma for him. It's a choice between a badly-behaving party that largely agrees with you and a better-behaving party that fundamentally does not welcome your worldview. Since he has real power and influence, he's decided to stay in Republican party and point it in his direction. If the GOP were full of Mitt Romneys you'd still disagree with it, but it's hard to argue that change wouldn't be good for America. I don't know if Romney's efforts will make a difference, but it's heartening to me at least to see him try.\n\nFor the record I do think personality and decency matters which is why I'm voting for Biden in 2020. I also have kind of given up on having a national Republican party I can be proud of for awhile. But I know there are some local and state-level Republicans who represent my views well in a decent way so I'm not gonna completely abandon them.",

They don't happen very often and they are mostly due to heartbreaking medical situations. Once you get past 24 weeks, if I'm recalling correctly, you really can only get an abortion in 3 places in the US. Like, 3 clinics. It costs about $8-10k dollars to get one done and that doesn't include cost of travel. It takes several days and is really rough on the body. Etc. Basically, nobody gets a 3rd trimester abortion cuz they decided, \"nah, I don't feel like being a mom.\" It's super expensive, extremely hard to obtain, and terrible on the body. Generally, they're performed for grief-stricken parents who have a horrific medical diagnosis. Like, a baby that will be crushed to death during birth by a fragile bone disorder is one example I can think of from the forum I belonged to when I was pregnant with my youngest and we were considering a medical termination due to her medical condition. I really can't stress how awful it is to be in the position of seeking an abortion past 16 weeks.\n\nSo... it is nearly always like taking someone off life support. Sometimes you do have \"gray diagnoses,\" which is like, we know the baby is really, really, really in bad shape, but we don't know if they'll die a few weeks after birth, live for a few years through a lot of suffering, or through treatment and surgery eventually achieve a good life/health. We had a gray diagnosis with my child, we wrestled with what to do because the worst outcomes were horrifying. I do not judge any parent in such a position, it is the most awful thing you will have to do.",

This causes the outrage that a child's life has been taken for the sake of *her* convenience, and we get to oppose abortion and vilify women simultaneously.\n\nThe reality is, if the right-wing wants to claim \"abortion is murder\", then almost all abortions in the third trimester (not sure about the stats in the second, but I assume it's similar) would carry with it a case for self-defence.",

There were a couple of occasions where i voted for individuals of another party where I felt they represented well on key issues of the time but otherwise was reasonably consistent. Since emigrating to the US I cant align with the GOP with what I consider an extremist right wing agenda. Here I seem to align better with center left candidates who are fairly fiscally conservative and socially liberal. From my perspective the \"far left\" in US are just normal left wing. Biden is more of a European conservative.",

European conservative figures (like Bismarck) made their policies based on keeping social stability and stopping revolutionary upsurges. I mean, Kaiser Wilhelm's early reign was one of social reform and expanding welfare, much of it remains in Germany today. \n\nTrade unions applied great pressure in the late 19th century. Bismarck was worried by the increasingly popular Social Democrats and cribbed off their policies to stunt their growth.\n\nAmerican \"conservatives\" only preserve individual freedom. European conservatives preserve social stability (good working conditions, sickness provision, social insurance, strong union organisation, restriction of work weeks).\n\nMany welfare states in Europe were created by conservatives. Workingmen's compensation in the UK came from Benjamin Disraeli (Tory PM) and he also legalised trade unions which lead to dramatic growth of British union membership.",

What about blue lives?\" (This was in response to Chris Rock saying black lives matters during the oscars in 2016)\n\nOr, in response to my oldest-brother saying \"You ever notice how the more rights *other people* get, the less rights white people get\" my dad said \"You're absolutely correct.\"\n\nHe recently messaged my twin who talks politics with him (I don't cause it just turns into a shit show every time and I hate it), saying he finally understands the white privilege thing. He talked about how George Floyd should still be alive and those cops should be in prison. When my twin told me this, my jaw fucking dropped. We never would have expected him to say something like that.\n\nAnd, I get *why* he was always against the idea of white privilege. He had a really really shitty life growing up. He had a hard childhood, and hard young adult years. He worked his fucking ass off with the odds stacked against him to get where he is now. He dropped out of college to support my mom and my oldest brother, and worked a fuck ton to support us throughout my childhood. The hospital bill for my birth was like 250,000 due to some wild complications when I was born and he had no help through it. When he saw White Privilege, he saw people saying his life was easy cause he was white. That his success wasn't his own.\n\nHe's finally seeing that it isn't that. It's honestly all thanks to these nationwide protests. Everyone doing protesting, or even supporting the protests in other ways should be fucking proud of themselves. They changed my fathers mind and I'm sure they are changing other people's minds, too.",

These are differences in moral values, differences that for some reason became politicized (maybe someone with a better grasp of politics/history in the USA can explain why).  \n\nI agree that severing relationships over political beliefs may be a bit much depending on what those differences are, but severing relationships over such huge differences in moral values isn\u2019t surprising. I think that\u2019s why so many people have such a visceral hatred for Trump. It\u2019s not because he has different political beliefs, it\u2019s because he represents all the wrong virtues while lacking all the virtues that many of us value, like honesty, integrity, courage, kindness, respect, reticence/restraint, self-reflection, accountability, judiciousness, etc. I could go on and on. And I know we\u2019re not talking about Trump here, but I do think he\u2019s worth mentioning because conservative Republicans seem to be unable to disagree with him in any meaningful way. So when Trump says protesters and BLM are in the wrong, then so do his supporters. I mean, you didn\u2019t even have to say your dad is a trump supporter but I can assume he is based off of his feelings about BLM. Was I right?\n\nI know I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain a relationship with someone with such a different set of moral values. Does that make me a snowflake? Maybe, but I think it just means I\u2019m not interested in being friends with someone who thinks that those who are protesting have no right to be angry about anything.",

The Republican party had just spent 4 years obstructing a president during the worst recession since the Great Depression.

McConnell was very clear that during a huge recession, his priority was to make sure Obama wasn't reelected. Compare that to this massive recession where not only have Dems worked with Republicans to pass aid packages, but they've wanted to go further than Republicans did to fix their own damn mess. \n\nIt was a big deal in 2012 whether or not that level of cynicism was rewarded. It just turned out that it took 4 more years for their cynicism to be rewarded, but still.",

Many times I\u2019ve had to explain to my white Friends why I couldn\u2019t go somewhere that they wanted until finally I did and then THEY saw how I was treated differently. It wasn\u2019t blatant but it was subtle and it was subtle enough for them to catch on. Ive had white friends calling me crying this week and that was painful in itself.  Not all people are bad and judgmental and I live by treating people by their own individual actions and seeing Mitt Romney standing with this country, photo op or not speaks volumes to me. He will be ostracized and demonized by his party, but he has a black grandson and he has to do his part to make sure his innocent grandson will not have to be automatically judged by his skin. I am proud of mitt just like I am proud of everyone peacefully protesting. This is a powerful and defining moment in history and while mitts colleagues are silent, he is on the right side of history and I will firmly recognize that.\n\nThis  is a human rights issue and Mitt stood up and marched.

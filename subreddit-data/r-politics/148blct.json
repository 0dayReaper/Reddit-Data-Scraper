But these guys have been a big part of the movement for the last century.  Donald Trump is a physical manifestation of the base republican voter in the same way that Hillary Clinton and Liz Warren are manifestations of the democrat base.\n\n&gt; Now that he's an electoral liability\n\nHe's a national liability in large part because he's lost popularity across the Midwest.  But Democrats are always one shit nomination away from making a guy like Trump viable again.\n\nMeanwhile, in states like Florida and Texas, he continues to be a major driver of party participation and support.  Guys like Ron DeSantis, Wesley Hunt, and Tommy Tubberville owe their stratospheric rise to Trump's support.  If you're in a Republican Primary, you *need* Trump's endorsement.  Otherwise, you simply don't have a base to build a campaign on.",

Karamo denied these allegations, saying they were an attempt by her ex-husband to \"exploit the fact that [she is] a public figure, using it as leverage to change the custody agreement he became dissatisfied with\". Kristina and Adom had divorced in 2014.\n\nKaramo believes that demonic possession is real and may be transferred through sexual relations. She has also said that abortion is child sacrifice and a satanic practice, that pop stars such as Beyonce, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish are tools of Satan recruiting their followers into paganism, and that yoga is a ritual to summon demons.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say Adom dodged a fucking bullet there, and the Michigan GOP, well, I guess they voted her in.",

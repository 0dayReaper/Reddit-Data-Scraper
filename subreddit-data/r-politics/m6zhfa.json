Because it isn't socialism in the traditional sense of this money goes to the government, but more this corpo-socialism, which I think is an idea that is fairly easy to get people on board with. I mean in these companies, these workers are helping them make that much money and they deserve a piece of that pie. How anyone could say any different is crazy to me. I mean the whole idea of \"you work hard and you get paid what you earn\" is central to so many conservative minded people, but they refuse to accept that CEOs and these high up people aren't actually *earning* any of that money, ie they likely aren't working that much more than a lot of the lower employees in terms of actual hours.",

The government restricted wages that could be paid as a wartime act. So companies competed to hire labor by offering ever increasing fringe benefits. The IRS later clairifed that these could be used as a tax deduction for businesses and that basically sealed the deal. There's a good series of podcasts from This American Life on this.

The decision was based on studies that claimed energy savings would be a result. In reality, energy use went up somewhat and parents complained about their children waling to school or waiting at the bus stop in total darkness. Daylight savings time was reinstated. Unfortunately, although times have changed substantially in the past 40 - 50 years, our geriatric Congress has not seen fit to properly observe the conditions in which we now live. The need for daylight savings time has come to an end, IMHO.",

The gauge of the tracks themselves is 4 foot 8 inches but the rolling stock itself is wider than the tracks are. If you have longer cars the width decreases to account for that so maybe that's what they're talking about but it isn't so much rated by the track gauge as the AAR plate the route can accommodate.",

People in a constant panic because they were scheduled to work over and didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs.\n\nWalmart itself was so weird. I was trained to be a cashier. I worked a register. Then one day they said I\u2019m doing stocking. I literally had no idea wtf to do, so when I stocked something wrong I got wrote up. A few days later I was working in the gun section and getting harassed by customers for not knowing about guns.

And I don\u2019t work \u201chere\u201d. I\u2019m \u201chere\u201d because my management sucks dick and can\u2019t schedule properly. \n\nThese motherfuckers had 19 year old me pulling cash from the drawers, counting it, writing down how much I pulled, and walking $1000s of dollars to the time safe.. like wtf? I was a delinquent kid and you\u2019re trusting me, by myself, with that much money and the ability to alter records? Don\u2019t be surprised that I pocketed some small bills and just flubbed the records.\n\nI eventually started getting frustrated when I made it very clear from the beginning that I go to night school and cannot work nights.. then they moved me to nights. I walked out after that. Turned out they lied and said I was fired for insubordination so I couldn\u2019t collect unemployment.. which I wasn\u2019t going to do anyway because I planned on finishing my current semester in 2 weeks and joining the military since I was too lazy to do anything else.",

If everyone took a higher paying job or quit their current job in protest how would those businesses continue to exist now that they have no employees? This is the side of the problem Conservatives cover their eyes and plug their ears when you bring up. Because it forces them to face the reality that those jobs only exist because they are exploiting vulnerable members of society. They are not sustainable without treating their employees like indentured servants. If a business is not sustainable while paying living wages to it's employees the owner is a failure, they suck at business, they should go work at McDonalds, not exploit other people to compensate for their pathetic failure, all while looking down on those same people in spite of their own failures. /endrant",

Using this they are required to include all forms of compensation, stock, company cars, company paid for perks such as CC membership, personal use of the corporate jet, etc. this would capture everything.  However the median employee number number can be gamed a bit by including or not including items. \n\nAt my prior employer I did this calculation on good faith, but a competitor was including the employer cost of healthcare in the median employee, which also allowed you to add it to the CEO pay.  However increasing the median employee by $10,000, which made up about 20% of their total comp had a significant downward push on the ratio as you were now dividing $5 million by 50,000 rather than 40,000. Which drove the ratio from 125:1 down to 100:1. Still high, but looks better to the media and shareholders.",

The unrealized gains aren\u2019t taxed, the income prior to any gains or losses is taxed.\n\nAt least that is what happens when I am given restricted stock. If I am gifted 10 units, 3 or 4 are taken out as taxes before the stock vests.",

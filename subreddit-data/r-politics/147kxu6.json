They were so deeply traumatized they both basically dropped out of politics entirely.\n\nRepublicans cannot compromise on anything.  Knee-jerk intransigent about every little goddamn thing.  When there's a Democratic Speaker they're all united in lock step.  As soon as they take control of the house it suddenly turns into a prison riot and the warden responsible for taking control of this prison riot is now Kevin McCarthy and he will not succeed.  He's going to get disemboweled by his own people before this is over.  Boehner wisely nope'd out before it got to that point and Ryan was strong-armed into taking the roll against his wishes and better judgement.\n\ntl;dr  Being GOP Speaker is a suicide mission.  Always has been.  McCarthy was an idiot for wanting this to be his clown show.",

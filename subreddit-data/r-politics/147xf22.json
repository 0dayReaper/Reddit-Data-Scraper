As in, the lawyer who he tried to have break the law for him, provided full and complete details of that effort to federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump also had a separate lawyer, Lawyer 3, sign a legal certification stating that she had reviewed all confidential documents that had been transferred to Maro Lago and had surrendered all confidential documents to the federal authorities. Trump knew having her sign that document was an act of fraud, because he had previously instructed the removal of boxes to hide them from his lawyers who were to review the documents.\n\nSo yeah, if I'm a lawyer with half a mind of preservation, I wouldn't get near this moron with a ten foot pole.\n\nEveryone should really read the indictment, the meat of it is probably about 20 pages double spaced, and it is spicy and we'll outlined.",

Because her earlier handling of this case went well outside the judicial norm and was roundly criticized by the Court of Appeals, reasonable observers of this case could question her impartiality. Federal law has a way to deal with this challenge: Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a judge \u201cshall disqualify himself [or herself] in any proceeding in which his [or her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Judge Cannon\u2019s situation clearly fits that test, and she is obligated to recuse herself in Trump\u2019s case.\n\n&gt; To be clear, our concern is not that Judge Cannon is a Trump appointee. The conflict of interest is that she has already issued unusual and profoundly wrong decisions favoring the defendant in this case that have been severely criticized and overturned, again by conservative or Trump-appointed judges.\n\n&gt; But what if Judge Cannon does not recuse herself? One possibility that should be explored is for the chief judge of the district court, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga, to reassign the case pursuant to the court\u2019s power under federal law to \u201cassign \u2026 cases so far as [local] rules and orders do not otherwise prescribe.\u201d Nothing in the Southern District of Florida\u2019s local rules or internal operating procedures is to the contrary. Those local procedures provide for Judge Cannon and her colleagues to agree to transfer the case to another judge. The chief judge should have a vigorous discussion with her under that provision. If Judge Cannon demurs, though, the rules are silent about what happens next and so the federal statute comes into play for the chief judge to reassign the case. She too can point to logistical concerns, including the security ones, in reassigning it to a judge in Miami\u2014 saving face for Judge Cannon.\n\n&gt; Under binding 11th Circuit precedents a case should be reassigned to a different judge if, among other reasons, the original judge would have \u201cdifficulty\u201d setting aside her previous views and findings and reassignment would not result in a waste of judicial resources. Those factors clearly weigh in favor of reassignment here, due to the difficulties that Judge Cannon will likely face in diverging from her previous unorthodox and wrongful rulings benefiting Trump.\n\n&gt; This is the path that appears most likely to be pursued if Judge Cannon is to be removed, because her approach thus far suggests that it unlikely that the judge will recuse herself. \n\n&gt; DOJ might choose to make the case in a recusal motion that it would be better for her and everyone concerned if she stepped aside. In just about any other high-profile criminal case, if a trial judge were to err in the direction of excessive leniency favoring a criminal defendant in a preliminary hearing and were reversed on appeal, law-and-order conservatives would be the first to say that trial judge had a conflict and should be removed. That judge\u2019s reputation would be on trial. Impartiality would be too dubious. The same is true here.",

I\u2019m betting they wait for now until she makes such a move then the request will come. DOJ and from what I\u2019ve seen, Jack Smith for that matter, are tactical in their moves and I don\u2019t see them rushing for a change when it hasn\u2019t been warranted (in this particular case, yet, please don\u2019t barrage me with what she did prior I\u2019m well aware and have been closely following this).",

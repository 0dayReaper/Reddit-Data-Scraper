What I am trying to discover is this, why does this Act give power over the Executive to a bureaucracy in the first place? And does Congress have the authority to make the Executive submit?",

A law created by congress and is signed in to law by the executive branch becomes law and future executive branch leadership can\u2019t just dismiss it and say \u2018the law doesn\u2019t apply to me\u2019. A sitting president does enjoy a lot of immunities but a former president is absolutely subject to the law. Being president isn\u2019t a magic ticket to being able to do any illegal thing you want after. When you say \u2018does congress have the authority to make the executive submit\u2019 that is not what is happening here. What is happening here is \u2018is a former president subject to the laws of the United States?\u2019. That\u2019s the question that will be answered in court with this case. We don\u2019t exactly know the answer because it\u2019s never been attempted before. Most former presidents don\u2019t haphazardly break the law so brazenly like Trump likes doing.",

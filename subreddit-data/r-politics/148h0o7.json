There may, however, be sketch artists, and theirs would be the only images from the actual courtroom appearance.\n\n&gt; There\u2019s also a prohibition on reporters bringing electronic devices into the courthouse, so there won\u2019t be live updates by tweet or text. That rule is usually up to to each federal judge, but an order has been issued in this case specifically imposing restrictions for Trump\u2019s initial hearing.",

All we have to do is to take a look at the Trump blueprint for being Teflon coated against lawsuits. Donald Trump and his businesses were involved in over 4,000 legal cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including battles with casino patrons, million-dollar real estate lawsuits, personal defamation lawsuits, and over 100 business tax disputes. Trump has spent a lifetime learning 'delay, postpone, request a continuance, and appeal' techniques to drag out court cases and to have them end in his favor or seem to get buried and forgotten somewhere. Is it any wonder this man feels justified in breaking the law? When has he ever been held accountable?",

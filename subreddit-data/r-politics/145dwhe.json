My elderly boomer neighbor spends dozens of hours a week in front of the TV, staring at the propaganda spewing shitbags from Fox. He started to babble to me some nonsense about LGBTQ evils. I asked if he personally knows a trans. person?  Nope.  Has he ever seen an actual trans. person, to his knowledge? Nope. Does he know of a relative, friend, or fellow church member that had ever interacted with a trans. person? Nope.\n\n So, you are essentially allowing these propagandists to rot your brain, and trick you into fearing someone that as far as you know is as real as the Easter Bunny.  You are being taught to hate somebody, and harm them, since you are told that they are evil and working hard to harm you, but they have never done a damn thing to you, in your seventy years of being an adult, and have neither harmed nor even interacted with hundreds of people you know, right?  \n\nYea, my friend, you are really walking aside Jesus on this issue, eh?",

I mean\u2026whole reason this dude even BECAME president in the first place is because the FBI announced in the worst way possible that they were re-opening their investigation into Hilary. \n\nSo, she\u2019s been investigated. Ad nauseam. And it was found that while she did do some things that weren\u2019t proper procedure, it was hard to find any criminal intent in her actions and that it likely was a result of just being a bit of an idiot around digital security. And that they wouldn\u2019t bring charges because they don\u2019t think any prosecutor would be willing to bring charges against her based on such a relatively small mistake lacking in criminal intent. \n\nWhich very much goes to the point that what Trump is being indicted for VERY MUCH carries the element of criminal intent. He willfully disobeyed repeated requests and orders to return the documents. Repeatedly. He moved the documents around to keep their location hidden from those trying to retrieve them. He bragged on tape that he knew they were still classified and that he knew he no longer had the power to declassify them. Some documents, like the one being referenced in that tape recording, STILL haven\u2019t been recovered and no one knows where they are. \n\nIt\u2019s night and fucking day and the only people who won\u2019t acknowledge as much are those who are operating in willful bad faith.",

Sadly, he had everything funnel through his co-defendant, who I'm sure will look for any means to lessen his sentence by cooperating now.

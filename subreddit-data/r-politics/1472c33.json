Before the Nazis came to power, it was second only to Paris when it came to the arts. Film, stage, music, painting, etc. As such, it attracted a large LBGTQ, crowd. They were the first to suffer when the Nazis took power.",

She would prefer that no one know that she is going to the restroom to empty and clean/change her bag. It's honestly no one's business but hers.\n\nBut people demand that it be their business when she walks into the handicap stall (so she can clean up with the sink in the stall instead of having to clean herself at the bathroom lobby sinks), and when she takes a little longer than others in the stall, and when it appears through the viewports in the doors that she is not sitting down but standing up at the sink. (She has been accused of using drugs during bag changes.)\n\nShe feels her dignity has been completely stripped from her, and the way she has been treated for her condition is quite frankly horrendous and unacceptable.\n\nSingle-user ADA-approved restrooms, available to everyone, complete with infant changing stations, should be the norm. Have 3 or 4 in every establishment. Maybe even have extra sinks outside the restrooms (for those who are just going to wash their hands before eating, as an example). \n\nMake the reason for changing to single-user rooms ADA-based (making all rooms ADA accessible) and offer monetary assistance to businesses to remodel their restrooms. The side benefit is that the restrooms are gender-neutral, able to be used by everyone.",

They used \u201cor\u201d rather than \u201cand\u201d in the sex education section \u2014 leading to big implications over how it's interpreted.\n\n&gt;As a result, districts can choose one of two bans in the section, according to the guidance. Districts can choose between prohibiting all mention of gender identity and sexual orientation across all grades or waiting to discuss human sexuality until sixth grade, education department officials said.",

Bills, particularly Republican ones, but it's the case with lots of Democrat sponsored bills as well, are written by lobbyists working for big money doners and think tanks. They're then given to a politician who has the main points of the bill summarized for them by aides, or maybe just the lobbyists themselves, and then taken to the \\[insert political body here\\] to be voted on. Much of the time politicians don't even know whats in the bills they stick their names on, they're constantly getting caught with their pants down, but they never suffer consequences because it rarely makes the news.",

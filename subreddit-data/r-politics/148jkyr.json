You merely deflected to a subjective opinion on whether or not Armslist is a patriot, whatever that means. The facts are that your subjective opinion has no bearing on the law, and the law states that Armslist is not liable for what its users do. This is very similar to the idea that Facebook isn't liable for what its users post on the site. Any illegal actions are the responsibility of the user and no one else.",

See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The obvious alternative explanation for the disclaimers is that they operate as \u201cat your own risk\u201d provisions. These provisions no more endorse illegal activity than a \u201cswim at your own risk\u201d sign placed at a hotel pool endorses using the pool to drown another. In fact, armslist.com\u2019s terms of use require users to certify that they \u201cwill not use Armslist.com for any illegal purpose.\u201d Bauer\u2019s claim for aiding and abetting tortious conduct therefore fails.",

You argue that those amendments only apply in the context that they were passed (very strict originalism/original meaning). Which is exactly what they're doing.\n\nThat, and by trying to find loopholes in the qualifying part of that clause:\n\n&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to the jurisdiction thereof**\n\nThere is a ton written about that bolded part. In the past, it was used to exclude members of Native American tribes from gaining citizenship. Conservative lawyers have, and still do, argue that it excludes migrants and even goes as far as excluding anyone who would owe allegiance to another country.\n\nTo think they wont try anything just because it's in the Constitution is ignoring a lot of the (legal) arguments they are trying to make.",

They cant even define that with natural born US citizens less they falsely assume that it is automatically to the US.  Best one can do is define \"Owing\" in that context being a function of dedication to the nation one is living in at a given moment. Which is something that republicans tend to fail at as proven by their policy positions, beliefs about government, and attempts to overthrow shit when people they don't like win elections.\n\nAt best this line of argumentation by them is just another attempt to create means by which people they don't like can be marginalized, dehumanized and abused/exploited in the process.",

Essentially everyone born on the countries soil acquires citizenship.\n\nIus sanguinis is the more commonly used principle; a child has the right to the nationality of either one of their parents. Sometimes the child only has the right to the parents citizenship (1 generation), sometimes of more generations.\n\nIus soli is often combined with some form of ius sanguinis (a child born to a US citizen in a foreign country does not automatically get the citizenship, but can easily acquire one with minor restrictions); it would be unfair to exclude a child born during holidays.",

Infiltrating the highest position of power allows the subversive elements to exert significant control over the decision-making processes and shape the direction of the country according to their ideology.\n\nHere's how such a scenario might unfold:\n\nInfiltration: The subversive elements would work covertly to place individuals sympathetic to their cause in key positions within the political establishment, including the presidency. This could involve manipulation, blackmail, or grooming of individuals who show vulnerability or ideological alignment with the subversive agenda.\n\nManipulation of Policies: Once the president is infiltrated, the subversives would begin influencing policies and decision-making processes in line with their ideology. They may advocate for measures that undermine the societal values, erode democratic principles, or promote policies that further the subversive agenda.\n\nExploiting Divisions: The infiltrated president would leverage their position to exploit existing divisions within society. They might emphasize identity politics, exacerbate social, economic, or racial tensions, or fuel partisan rivalries to create a sense of turmoil and discord. This would contribute to the destabilization of the targeted society.\n\nPromoting Propaganda: The infiltrated president would have access to significant media and communication channels, which they would use to disseminate propaganda that supports the subversive agenda. They would manipulate public opinion, shape the narrative, and suppress dissenting voices or opposing viewpoints to maintain control over the information flow.\n\nConsolidating Power: The infiltrated president, along with their subversive allies, would seek to consolidate power by weakening or co-opting key institutions that serve as checks and balances. They may manipulate the judiciary, limit freedom of the press, or undermine the opposition, aiming to establish an authoritarian regime that supports their ideological goals.\n\nRepression and Control: As the subversive elements solidify their control, they would suppress dissent and opposition, employing tactics such as censorship, surveillance, and intimidation. The goal would be to stifle any resistance to their rule and maintain a tight grip on power.\n\nIn this scenario, the president's infiltration becomes a powerful tool for the subversives to advance their agenda and fundamentally transform the targeted society. By leveraging the president's authority, access to resources, and influence, the subversive elements can implement policies and shape the narrative in a way that aligns with their ideological objectives, ultimately leading to the erosion of democratic principles and the consolidation of their power.",

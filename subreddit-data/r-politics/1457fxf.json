You wouldn't want to run a ton of candidates still, but it could easily be possible to, say, have a Trump Republican and a moderate one both run in the general.

The Wall Street Journal recently quoted Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, who said Biden was up by 39 points with such voters.\n\nUnless there is ranked-choice voting in all states, a third candidate will always hurt the Democrats more than the Republicans. If Jill Stein hadn't siphoned votes away from HRC in 2016, the women in the country would still have rights over their bodies. If 540 or so Ralph Nader voters had voted for Al Gore, we would be 20 years ahead on protecting the climate and millions wouldn't have died or been maimed trying to find the elusive WMDs. People need to look at history and realize that this virtue-signaling with their votes in the general elections have serious consequences.

If these 3rd parties were being honest about wanting to offer options and make a difference they would put efforts in winning local and state level elections first and foremost.

You and I could debate all day the merits of a lack of distinction, but it's not relevant here.\n\nHowever, if you see a distinction between Trump and Biden and prefer one over the other, voting third party is essentially giving up your choice between the two. Those two are the most likely to win by an astronomical margin. We have a better chance under the current voting system of being hit by an asteroid during a full moon than we do of a third party actually winning. The system is rigged against a third party.\n\nIf you want options, get people into local offices that espouse ranked choice or similar voting systems. Get rid of FPTP. Get rid of the 'winner take all' electoral system. Then, and only then, will you have the option to choose a third party without sacrificing the better of the two major candidates losing due to the spoiler effect.",

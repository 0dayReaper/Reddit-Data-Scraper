And the strategically misleading intel being funneled to Russia could be regarding invading Ukraine being easy, only taking a few weeks tops\u2026 *all while secretly strengthening Ukraine\u2019s military.* Trump\u2019s first impeachment was over him trying to withhold military aid to Ukraine.",

Only, once this leak is confirmed, keep sending more false intel through the known sources. \n\nThis already happens, often.",

There were a lot of other Republican officials very close to trump who did the same just after Jan 6th.  \n\nYes, they never should have enabled trump or went along with his lunacy, and maybe it was self preservation or trying to avoid culpability. Irregardless, I am happy Bill Barr did not play Trumps game with the 2020 election. At the end of the day, he probably could have, but I do believe he understood the danger of that and backed down.  \n\nIdk how we start holding Republican officials accountable for blind support of Donald Trump, but I feel like that is where we need to start.",

These scumbags who aren\u2019t fit to run a hot dog stand? He gave them jobs in his PRESIDENTIAL administration. Not some little side hustle, the literal White House. Some of the most important and powerful positions on Earth. Trump gave them to people who (evidently) were total pieces of shit, because he\u2019s too dumb to tell they weren\u2019t good people.\n\nOr, his other excuse to deflect when people spill the beans on him: They begged him, crying, groveling on the floor. Which tells us that all you have to do to be given a position of huge authority in his administration was cry and beg.\n\nWhat a great defense of Trump. He\u2019s stupid and gullible enough to fill his administration with people just waiting to stab him in the back, but that\u2019s somehow not his fault. We should totally entrust the most powerful office on the planet to a man who evidently can\u2019t help but get hustled at every turn.",

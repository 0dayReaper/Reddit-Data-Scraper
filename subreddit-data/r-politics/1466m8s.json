And based on the lopsided court opinion, neither did most of the Supreme Court (of course Clarence Thomas disagreed, he's really just the worst).",

In a footnote he even mentioned gender identity shouldn't make a person be able to be fired. \n\nHis background is terrible and he's been involved in terrible decisions.

It's been extremely effective in many places, just never in the US.\n\n&gt;Pretending to our selves the only option is \u201cjust don\u2019t do drugs kids\u201d is always going to fail.\n\nI used to think this way, until we got 10 years of 'harm reduction' style policies that have caused untold harm in the communities where they were implemented and have left virtually all of them worse off than they were a decade ago.\n\nTo use the other guy's example of Portland.  Do you look at those people shooting up in the streets and shitting in front of restaurants and think they'd really be worse off if they were imprisoned?\n\nIf drug policy is a spectrum, on the far end of the spectrum you'd have places like Portland and Seattle, the US War on Drugs of the 80s-2000s somewhere in the middle (harsh policies but selective/lax/poor enforcement), and on the opposite far end you'd have places like Tokyo and Singapore, who are super harsh on drug users, and have shown that having extremely punitive drug laws and saying \"just don't do drugs\" is possible.  \n\nSo, if we agree that Portland-style drug policy is a failure, and the War on Drugs was obviously a failure, then it seems to me the logical step is to move to Japan-style drug policy.\n\nUnless your argument also includes an element of \"we should just be allowed to do drugs because they're fun\" (which they are), and think the impact on society is minimal or not worth discussing.  But the US currently ranks #1 in the world in illicit drug use by a wide margin, and is in the top 10 in Opioid use (and is #1 in opioid use by far among developed nations- or #2 if you count Russia as a developed nation).  But if the conversation is \"how to we stamp out drug use\", there are verifiable and repeatable ways to do it.\n\nEDIT:  [Source for these numbers.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/drug-use-by-country)",

Are you claiming that those policies don't work at all and should never be implemented or are there specific ones that do work but aren't being implemented or can't be implemented? What harm have they caused? \n\nYes, they'd be worse off in prison. \n\nPortland and Seattle have the most lax drug policy in the world? Wow! That's quite a claim! I would think most people would consider Portugal to be on the far end of the spectrum considering they've decriminalized all drugs. What parameters are you using to make that determination? \n\nSo, Tokyo and Singapore have more punitive drug laws, and where's the evidence that they work? What's the flip side of those laws? Do they cause harm at all? If so, what harm and in what numbers? How do they differ from American laws or Portland/Seattle laws?\n\nAnd, you're claiming that Tokyo and Singapore have the harshest drug laws? Not a place like the Philippines? Or Saudi Arabia?\n\nYou haven't proven that Portland style policies have been a failure but even if they are, you've presented a false choice. There are no other choices besides what Portland does and what Singapore does?\n\nWhere's the proof that they are repeatable?",

Amsterdam, etc. That\u2019ll give you something to think about on the legalization end. \n\nAnd as for the idea that anyone is \u201cbetter off in prison\u201d. Seriously, that\u2019s some twisted empathy. Not to mention it\u2019s crazily expensive keeping people incarcerated. \n\nYou seems to be missing the missing the point, we need rules that provide alternatives to jumping people _before_ they fall into the hole.

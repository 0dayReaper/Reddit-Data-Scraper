Do you look at those people shooting up in the streets and shitting in front of restaurants and think they'd really be worse off if they were imprisoned?\n\nIf drug policy is a spectrum, on the far end of the spectrum you'd have places like Portland and Seattle, the US War on Drugs of the 80s-2000s somewhere in the middle (harsh policies but selective/lax/poor enforcement), and on the opposite far end you'd have places like Tokyo and Singapore, who are super harsh on drug users, and have shown that having extremely punitive drug laws and saying \"just don't do drugs\" is possible.  \n\nSo, if we agree that Portland-style drug policy is a failure, and the War on Drugs was obviously a failure, then it seems to me the logical step is to move to Japan-style drug policy.\n\nUnless your argument also includes an element of \"we should just be allowed to do drugs because they're fun\" (which they are), and think the impact on society is minimal or not worth discussing.  But the US currently ranks #1 in the world in illicit drug use by a wide margin, and is in the top 10 in Opioid use (and is #1 in opioid use by far among developed nations- or #2 if you count Russia as a developed nation).  But if the conversation is \"how to we stamp out drug use\", there are verifiable and repeatable ways to do it.\n\nEDIT:  [Source for these numbers.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/drug-use-by-country)",

I would think most people would consider Portugal to be on the far end of the spectrum considering they've decriminalized all drugs. What parameters are you using to make that determination? \n\nSo, Tokyo and Singapore have more punitive drug laws, and where's the evidence that they work? What's the flip side of those laws? Do they cause harm at all? If so, what harm and in what numbers? How do they differ from American laws or Portland/Seattle laws?\n\nAnd, you're claiming that Tokyo and Singapore have the harshest drug laws? Not a place like the Philippines? Or Saudi Arabia?\n\nYou haven't proven that Portland style policies have been a failure but even if they are, you've presented a false choice.

It\u2019s not a simple spectrum.\n\nI agree that there are cultural differences and that what works in some places doesn't work in others.  But ultimately what will need to happen to fix the drug epidemic in the US is a change in the culture. It would probably take a full generation at least to effect this change, but we spent 2+ generations on the failed war on drugs, and are closing in on a generation of failed harm reduction policies.  If anything is going to reverse the trend in the US, it's going to have to be a massive undertaking that takes decades.\n\nAlso, as an aside, Japan's suicide rate is no longer \"exceptionally high\" compared to the US.  In fact, for people under 35, the US suicide rate is actually considerably higher than Japan's, and it gets worse the younger you go. For people ages 15-24, Japan has a suicide rate of 8.6 per 100,000, while the US has a rate of 13.8 per 100k- *almost twice as high*.\n\nPer the WHO, [the US suicide rate as of 2019 is actually higher overall than Japan's.](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en)  \n\n&gt;And as for the idea that anyone is \u201cbetter off in prison\u201d. Seriously, that\u2019s some twisted empathy.\n\nI don't think so.  Would you argue that Jordan Neely would not have been better off in prison?  These people need help, and sure the US prison system is not way to get help, but it gets them off the streets and dries them out if nothing else. In decriminalizing this type of stuff we've essentially just abandoned a lot of these people, many of whom are a danger to themselves and others, to just fend for themselves. I don't buy that just leaving people like Jordan Neely on the streets is anything resembling compassion.  If anything it is just a total abdication of the basic responsibilities of the state.\n\nI actually think bringing back institutions would be the best way to address these problems, so the people actually would be getting proper help, but if you're familiar with the history of mental institutions in the US you know that that's a slippery slope in its own right.  \n\n&gt;You seems to be missing the missing the point, we need rules that provide alternatives to jumping people before they fall into the hole. You can\u2019t do that if you if you keep banning everything.\n\nI totally understand what you're getting at, but I do not think introducing people to 'safe, legal, regulated hard drugs' would do anything but have a negative effect on society and produce more addicts who switch to illegal drugs once they can no longer get the legal ones.\n\nHell, that's pretty much exactly what happened with the opioid crisis.  It took less than a decade to spiral from Oxycontin- a legal drug available only by prescription from a Doctor (meaning it was given out only after a medical professional deemed it both safe and appropriate) to where we are now with Fentanyl.  That's pretty much the textbook example of what someone who calls for 'safe, legal, regulated hard drugs' could ask for, and it was a disaster.",

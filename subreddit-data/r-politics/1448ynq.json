            "comment": "&gt; Multiple lawyers working for Trump, however, told me there is no meaningful coordination across the groups. There are no standing meetings or calls \u2014 a common feature of large defense teams handling complex matters on behalf of a single client \u2014 to provide updates or compare notes among the groups. **Even today, some of the lawyers working on Trump\u2019s most important matters have never met or even spoken to one another,** and they have little insight into what\u2019s happening in the proceedings they aren\u2019t directly working on. \u201cYou do what you do, then we all convene later and find out later what everyone else has done,\u201d as one of them put it.\n\nOoof\n\n&gt; Some of the lawyers I spoke with acknowledged how strange it is that an ostensibly wealthy former U.S. president finds himself with such a professionally and geographically fractured group, but they cited a variety of explanations, all having to do with Trump himself. One reason, they said, is that Trump is cheap and has apparently been reluctant to spend the sort of money his legal circumstances would seem to demand.\n\nSounds about right.",

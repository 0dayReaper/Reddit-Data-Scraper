There are a lot of US citizens who want a better country, but our insane political situation is making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything.  I can\u2019t guarantee that outside pressure will directly contribute to change, but maybe a reminder that the world is still watching us will tip the scales.  Thanks again, and we love you.",

They and all the other migrant-sending countries got a lot of pats on the back from international humanitarian organizations for being so progressive when it comes to immigration and refugees/asylum seekers. However when push comes to shove we see things like the detention center fire, and their pitiful numbers of accepted asylum applications. \n\nBarely hear a peep about how they are flouting their own laws, from all the organizations that constantly sue the U.S. any time we try and implement a more restrictive fix of our border problems. In fact I don\u2019t think I have **ever** even seen the Cartagena Declaration and Mexico\u2019s obligations from codifying it into their laws be mentioned by anyone in the media in the past 5 years.",

Their policies are wildly unpopular. They do nothing to help their voters lives materially.\n\nFascism lite was their strategy for a while ala Gerrymandering, voter suppression etc, - but even lite fascism isn't enough anymore.\n\nFascism trades \"Improving the material lives of their constituents\" for \"Defeating ***the enemy***\"\n\nIt's a destructive method of gaining votes. There must always be An Enemy. \n\nBut propping up an enemy so you can destroy them ***is preferable to them and their rich masters*** than *actually* sacrificing a portion of their immense wealth so that the people on the whole may prosper.\n\n\"Win by any absolutely means necessary, in the sole name of protecting the wealth of the wealthy.\"\n\nThey do not care about religion, except that it's a convenient way to score a lot of votes. They do not care about freedom, except when it's convenient to secure votes. \n\nWhen they have the votes, they give more money to the wealthy over and over and over. They never give anything to the working class. In fact - they often take away from the working class by weakening social safety nets. \n\nThey toss red meat to the base in the form of religious laws and attacking \"The Enemy\" and that's about all they actually \"Do\" - and those \"benefits\" are merely a circus to distract them from the fact that Every. Single. One. of their financial laws hurts their voter base.",

They want white women to have more babies, and they want women of color to be impoverished and trapped with more impoverished children they can't afford.  The problem is that they don't know fucking anything about how pregnancy even works; from how dangerous it is to how asininely common miscarriages and missed periods are. Our healthcare for people with female anatomy is already abysmal.  Ask anyone with ovarian cysts or a uterine disorder how long it took them to actually get screened. This was never about babies or women. Crime rates go up when abortion is restricted.  They can use that too. \n\nThis is just eugenics, drawing from the Great Replacement hogwash that so many federalist society nutjobs believe. The cruelty is the point.",

(Make you watch shiny happy people) \n\nFor Kids:\n\n* Make sure they know that their parents do not own them\n* Make sure they know there are laws that protect them even from their parents \n* Make sure they know what resources are available if they ever need help and how to reach those resources.   \n\nThis would solve most of these \"culture war\" issues in a generation or two at max, maybe in under a decade.   \n\nIf women seeking an abortion can be forced to get a stick shoved up them and be told lies about medicine, then I don't see what this would be against acceptable practices.",

This is how genocide starts. There\u2019s no gas chambers yet, but it shouldn\u2019t need to get that far before we try to stop it.\n\nHate crimes for reasons of gender identity have been on the rise (actually *all* hate crimes have been on the rise). They are often underreported on top of that, especially for trans and gender nonconforming people. And this doesn\u2019t consider at all the fact that trans people have very high rates of suicide, due to hostility from society around them.\n\nThe best time to stop a genocide is before it starts. We shouldn\u2019t need to get to the level of gas chambers before we act. We are seeing the seeds of genocide sprout here, we need to cut it off before (more) people die.\n\nAs for hard numbers, the FBI recorded 266 hate crimes for gender identity, and 188 \u201cmultiple bias\u201d hate crimes. Nobody knows exactly how many trans people die due to suicide because most death investigators don\u2019t collect data on sexuality or gender identity, but an estimated 40% of trans people have attempted suicide and 80% have considered it.

It\u2019s literally how those laws can be repealed. \n\nThe president can\u2019t just repeal them one-by-one via by execute order. :(\n\nNow, can/should more be done??? **YES**, absolutely, unequivocally. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s disinformatively misleading to claim Biden and his administration have done/are doing nothing (see below). \n\nFrom the article: \n\n&gt; As part of Thursday\u2019s announcement, **the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights will appoint a new coordinator specifically tasked with combating book bans enacted at the state and local level**.\n\n&gt; In March, the American Library Association released data documenting 1,269 demands to censor library books and resources in 2022, marking the highest number of attempted book bans since the association began compiling the data more than 20 years ago. \u2026 **Almost a third of the bans were the result of NEWLY ENACTED STATE LAWS, according to the report, which found bans were most prevalent in five states: Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah and South Carolina**.\n\n\u2026 \n\n&gt; The administration is **ALSO** expected to unveil **a new Department of Homeland Security-led partnership with the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services** to provide \u201cdedicated safety training and resources,\u201d (**and**) an expanded DOJ LGBTQ working group, (**and**) new advisories **from HHS** to help mental health providers care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, **AND** initiatives to protect LGBTQ youth in foster care **AND** combat youth homelessness in the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u2026\n\n&gt; In his first month in office, **Biden signed an executive order REPEALING a ban on most transgender Americans joining the military**, while in December, **he SIGNED INTO LAW the Respect for Marriage Act codifying federal protections for same-sex and interracial couples**.\n\n\u2026\n\n\n&gt; In 2021, Biden became the **first** US president to ever issue a presidential proclamation to mark International Transgender Day of Visibility.\n\n&gt; During last year\u2019s Pride Month celebrations, **the president issued an EXECUTIVE ORDER which included actions to address legislative efforts in states** across the country, **protecting children from conversion therapy, safeguarding programs to prevent youth suicide **AND** a new initiative to protect foster youth**.\n\n&gt; And in April, **the administration proposed a new FEDERAL RULE CHANGE** that would allow for schools to enforce some restrictions on transgender student athletes, but **opposes policies that \u201ccategorically\u201d ban those students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender**. The reaction from LGBTQ advocates was mixed, with some groups saying the proposed guidance doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nMore at link.\n\ne:\n\nmoar sauce per DOJ\u2019s role\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-challenges-tennessee-law-bans-critical-medically-necessary-care\n\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ocr/lgbtqi/index.html\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/civil-rights-division-and-lgbt-rightsr",

Can't tell you how happy I am he's going to public school next year.\n\nIt's not going to guarantee his problems are solved, but he might finally get tested and he'll have more variety in groups of kids, aka a chance to fit in with somebody. I had a rough time in school, but even as a bit of an outcast there was always someone I could talk to and befriend. I couldn't imagine tacking autism onto that as well, so I feel for the kid no matter what school he goes to. Anyway sorry for the tangent.",

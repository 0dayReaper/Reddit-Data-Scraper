In other words, the indictment itself is selecting for the most egregious examples of criminality, so the pattern you see in those documents is more likely to be the pattern of what the investigators viewed as egregious, rather than the pattern of what Trump wanted to do with all these boxes.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean I think he *wasn't* selling them.

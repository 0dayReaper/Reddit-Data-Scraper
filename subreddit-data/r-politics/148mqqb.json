This lead to repealed the independent commission measure, allowing for gerrymandering by the party in power to take place in Missouri.

If you have a state that is 40% black, but the black people are evenly spread out, a \"fair\" map would have zero districts with a black majority.\n\nYou have to take into context the fact that for many years, the lines were drawn explicitly to prevent black districts from happening. \n\nEven in Alabama's case, without that context, a single black majority district probably looks fair, because the black people are mostly concentrated along the \"fertile soil belt\" that was worked by slaves in the 1800s. So you can draw a district that encompasses that, it is maybe 60% black, and the rest of the districts never rise above 40% black people, with some well under 30%. Looks fair, right? Except that across the entire state, 27% of the population is black, and they have 7 congressional districts, so 1/7 is 14%, 2/7 is 28%. To get to that 2nd potential district, you need to draw some funkier lines.\n\nSo what is \"fair\" there?",

And since so many maps are gerrymandered, it'd probably spit out a gerrymandered map.\n\nThat's one of the problems we're having right now. A lot of algorithms are trained on 'flawed' data - police AI's/algorithms are messed up not because people of color are more likely to commit crimes, but they're more likely to be arrested for it. So to the AI training off the arrest records, it thinks people of color are more likely to offend. And there you go, racist AI. Or people are more likely to give a white man a loan/mortgage/etc, so the AI/algorithm thinks a white man should get one over others because there's more acceptances for it and boom, racist AI.\n\n\nSorry for the ramble - I'm in an English course atm and my term paper is about the ethics of AI, this is something I talked about in it.

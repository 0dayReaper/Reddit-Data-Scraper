Once someone demonstrates they are not operating in good faith, you don't give them a do-over with no oversight.\n\nThe judge should have given them a deadline where they needed a map approved by X date, otherwise an independent group/computer program would draw the map. Or don't even give them the second chance and immediately gone the independent commission route.",

If you have a state that is 40% black, but the black people are evenly spread out, a \"fair\" map would have zero districts with a black majority.\n\nYou have to take into context the fact that for many years, the lines were drawn explicitly to prevent black districts from happening. \n\nEven in Alabama's case, without that context, a single black majority district probably looks fair, because the black people are mostly concentrated along the \"fertile soil belt\" that was worked by slaves in the 1800s. So you can draw a district that encompasses that, it is maybe 60% black, and the rest of the districts never rise above 40% black people, with some well under 30%. Looks fair, right? Except that across the entire state, 27% of the population is black, and they have 7 congressional districts, so 1/7 is 14%, 2/7 is 28%. To get to that 2nd potential district, you need to draw some funkier lines.\n\nSo what is \"fair\" there?",

Jim Trusty.\n\nIt gets better though:\n\nThe morning the indictment was to be unsealed, Trusty was on TV saying Trump was innocent.\n\nImmediately after the indictment was unsealed...  Trusty quit.\n\n&gt; Two lawyers who represented Donald Trump in the months before the former president was indicted on federal charges over his handling of classified documents quit working for him Friday morning.\n\n&gt; The attorneys, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, did not explain in detail why they had resigned, other than to say in a joint statement that \u201cthis is a logical moment\u201d to do so given his indictment Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami.\n\n&gt; [--CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/trump-lawyers-quit-classified-documents-case.html)\n\nSeeing proof that your client is guilty as hell IS, indeed, a logical moment to GTFO.  I'm guessing he noped out of there as soon as he saw the toilet pic.\n\nG.O.P. = Grand Old Potty",

I still have this gnawing doubt that I'm a fraud and someone is going to figure it out and I'll wind up begging for food and yet I see this people who worship Trump and somehow they own houses, own big trucks. I realize it may be all debt financed but how they are not \"economically anxious.\"  And perhaps they are and worshipping Trump just fills that gnawing void so that can look down on others when they crash and burn because at least they aren't \\[fill in whatever minority group MAGA has decided to hate this month\\].  I was raised with an overinflated sense of responsibility - definitely the source of my ulcers, so I tend to internalize and blame all my difficulties in my life on my own failings. I recognize it's not healthy and am working on that, but dang if part of me doesn't just long to be stupid and happy.",

Reading anything you mentioned is (likely) *literally* not *possible* for them.\n\n\nMaybe someone needs to make picture books for his supporters that explain the indictments etc? You know, for the good of the country.\n\nSide note, given the fact that it's been reported repeatedly that trump wouldn't read briefings, that his staff/advisors resorted to essentially photo filled power points to brief him (even 1 Page summaries apparently proved to be to much for most topics) it's debatable if the *former president of the United States* is capable of reading above the 4th grade level. Now, whether this would be due to lack of education, intelligence or a result of cognitive decline, is not clear. I will say that Trump spoke much more clearly in interviews when he was younger.",

But he is happy to use them as cannon fodder.\n\nThis is what drives me crazy about democrats. They should be out there highlighting that Trump left all the Jan 6th insurrectionists out to dry. He didn't spend one cent to help them. He could have even pardoned them all before he left office.\n\nHe did nothing.\n\nWill that soak into every MAGA mind? Of course not, but this is the off ramp you give them. Trump betrayed them. They can turn on him and can convince themselves they weren't just stupid.",

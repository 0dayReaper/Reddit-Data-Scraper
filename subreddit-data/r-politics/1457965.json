I just think they have a bad relationship with fiction and reality.\n\nThis also probably explains why they are so heavily invested in conspiratorial thinking and fall for some of the most stupid scams and stories.",

Usually it's corruption in the police we're \"supposed to respect\", or the systems meant to act as a safety net fail to help.\n\nFirst Blood, isn't a hurrah kill super villains movie it's a movie exposing the government's failure to care for traumatized vets who come home to a country that hates the way they fought.\n\nFrank Castle isn't taking the law into his hands because he feels like it.. It's because his family was gunned down by mobsters and the law ignored it. He wants to create a world where he's thrown in jail along with the rest of the criminals.\n\nBut these elements are ignored in favor of guns are cool and killing is rad.",

Millions of people are behind bars, wearing ankle bracelets, are no longer employable, etc. Thousands are killed on our streets by law enforcement for not cooperating sufficiently. Our legal system is tireless in its pursuit of criminals, **when those criminals are poor people**. \n\nIt is disgusting!

RICO has a much better opportunity of working in Georgia when there were multiple players trying to get to the same goal via several ways.  Guiliani was off doing XYZ, Meadows was involved, Trump was obviously involved, all the fake electors were involved, lindsay graham, and many others, I'm assuming like John Eastman.  It's a different kind of conspiracy, the documents conspiracy (so far) is more like the hushmoney conspiracy where Individual-1 is named as a co-conspirator, that's how conspiracy is being used here.  \n\nIf he's still working for Trump and has been represented by Trump's lawyers and lied multiple times to the FBI about the documents flat out I think he's a \"true believer\", especially because he's still working for Trump.  I have no doubt that Trump will try and throw him under the bus, but most of the illegality is surrounding Trump here, Nauta was only co conspiring tohide the documents, they weren't in his position, and he wasn't disceminating them or a part of keeping them from NARA.  He conspired in obstruction of justice.  \n\nI think there's another witness that was working alongside Nauta that is referenced in text conversations that is probably the witness.  I think Nauta is probably dead to rights and, like I said, is used as a charging anchor, so that if they charge him or Trump with anything it'll have to be similar in sentencing.",

As you know, I\u2019m very doing business and I have a lot of documents. Nobody has more documents than me. That\u2019s what people are saying, \u2018Trump, nobody in the history of the world has had more documents than you.\u2019 And he must have snuck those documents out of the White House. I believe he\u2019s a foreigner, look at the guys name. Is he from Mexico? He\u2019s gotta be from Mexico. Anyways, I barely know him. He was a low level aide that I believe I briefly met. Actually, I think I fired him. Nobody secures documents better than me so if I had them, you would have never known. But Walt had them, and I believe he was trying to sell them to Hunter Biden. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, he may be a spy for the Biden crime family. I\u2019m not saying that, people are saying that. But I wish him a lot of luck and if he had those documents he should be punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d",

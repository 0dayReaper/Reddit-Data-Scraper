That being said tolerating the Saudis was conditional on its uneasy allegiance to the US in the great power game. Since they've become more closely aligned to the Russians and Chinese I'm fire with either dirty tricks or an iron fisted approach to the Saudis. If progressives want a confrontation with the Saudis then they should be clear eyed that confrontation means hurting people not moralizing. Antagonizing a powerful country you don't intend to hurt greviously is purely an act of self-harm benefiting no one. \n\n The Saudi royals don't care if US sanctions reduce their 50 billion dollar fortune becomes 38 billion dollars. Economic warfare works by making truck drivers and waiters food insecure and crushing their dreams of prosperity. I am realist that believes the long term prosperity of my family  community and humanity as home requires a confrontation with the rising authortarian powers that will lead to immense harm to a very large amount of people but is preferable to the alternative of a world under the boot of fascists.",

            "comment": "Half a dozen comments and not a damn one of them appears to have read the article. \n\nThe premise of the article is that when US agencies wargame out a conflict with China over Taiwan  they frequently run into the same outcome.   \n\nThat outcome is that China launches a flash invasion of Taiwan along with pre-emptive strikes on US assets in the Region. the US begins striking back and providing aid to Tawain.  However,  30-60 days in, the US Has significantly depleted its stores of advanced weapons, and the conflict is reduced to a Stalemate, with a siege of Taiwan that is only broken by moving the war into a traditional military conflict that is more akin to what is occurring in Ukraine right now and that will result in high casualties and high cost of material. \n\nThe article quotes several different senior US military leaders to establish the premise that they believe the US is unprepared in a military industrial fashion for such a war, because the US has adapted to a lean, highly technological military at the same time it has lost most of its domestic industrial capacity. \n \nThat is, when we get into a war where we might actually lose dozens of ships and airplanes and tanks and need to replace them ASAP, or produce hundreds or even thousands of new guided missiles, shells and other smart weapons a month.  Where do the replacements come from and how fast can we build them?? \n\nThese leaders see this as a major weakness in the United States in the possibility that the US has to move into a war where we can't rely on stealth aircraft and smart weapons to gain a clear advantage in a quick fashion and start having to contemplate a war where battles will result in casualty counts in the thousands and the need to replace hundreds of destroyed vehicles and aircraft. \n\nThe authors of the article describe a thorny problem where to even begin to rebuild some of the domestic manufacturing capacity, there have to be trained workers that aren't present.  And that even if the military budget were greatly increased, in the event of a major war with China, we'd run into base level problems sourcing steel and ceramics and semiconductors and the baseline skilled labor necessary to build all of those things.  They fear that constructing that baseline capacity comes with a timeline of decades, and if a war came up by surprise, it would be far too late. \n\nThe counterpoint is that this is functionally an article describing the desires of the leaders of the military industrial complex.    Because in  light of budget fights,  they are fraid that cutting the military budget in a real fashion might come onto the table.   And while it is a non-trivial chance of a broad military conflict with china in coming decades,   a national project to ensure that the US builds and maintains significant technological and dual purpose industrial capacity within the domestic economy would be a boon to the whole military industrial complex.",

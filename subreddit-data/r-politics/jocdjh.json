Idk how people can justify that move when they can't yell about \"China\"\n\nEdit: There's too many replies from overnight to reply to, but my opinion is just because something isn't perfect doesn't necessarily make walking away the better option. People talking about establishing a US version have an unrealistic opinion of our global standing and capabilities, imho. I'm not saying the WHO is perfect but you don't get to make decision's or improvements when you walk away. WHO is very established and capable. Complaining China has too much influence then giving the whole thing to them is self defeating.",

                            "comment": "Just so we all understand how much money the US contributed:\n\n\u201cFor the two-year cycle of 2018 and 2019, U.S. contributions accounted for about 20% of the WHO's total budget. The money comes in two streams. The U.S. contribution to the pool of assessed fees is $237 million. That's 22% of the total assessed fees, the largest share of any nation.\u201d\n\nJust this election has cost  both parties $14 billion. In the bigger scheme of things, the US contribution is a drop in the ocean and hardly even worth batting an eyelid over. You spend $20 billion on air conditioning your troops in Afghanistan alone. It was an incredibly petty and selfish move. It\u2019s disgusting that it even happened and all that\u2019s going to happen is the rest of the planet will have to make up for the US contribution, you\u2019ll just not be a part of it anymore. For $237 million?! It hardly seems worth it. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2011/06/25/137414737/among-the-costs-of-war-20b-in-air-conditioning?t=1604566631817\n\nEdit: \n\nSo another poster commented, correctly, that the US contribution was close to a billion however, the extra $656 million was pledged, so it\u2019s a voluntary donation. \n\nHere\u2019s the full article: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/15/834666123/trump-and-who-how-much-does-the-u-s-give-whats-the-impact-of-a-halt-in-funding\n\n\u201cThe money comes in two streams. The U.S. contribution to the pool of assessed fees is $237 million. That's 22% of the total assessed fees, the largest share of any nation. By comparison, China contributes 12% of this pool of monies, and some low-income countries pay 0.1%.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. pledged more than $656 million for specific programs, according to the WHO's program budget portal. These voluntary contributions were earmarked for programs including polio eradication, health and nutrition services, vaccine-preventable diseases, tuberculosis, HIV \u2014 and preventing and controlling outbreaks.\u201d",

Murdoch has [himself admitted](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/business-spectator/news-story/foxtel-and-the-nbn--threat-or-opportunity-/2918252bb02cad6005e6d5047bd5776c), that he is threatened by Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\nAnd if you don't think Murdoch was involved in the LNP's decision, just remember the fact that the LNP made the announcement that they would be trashing the NBN [at Murdoch's Fox HQ in Sydney, rather than at Parliament in Canberra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2QUvcShNzg). It's pretty damning, if you ask me.",

It's not by chance that his personal attorney brought forth a case against his opponent's son to be litigated in the court of public opinion with no evidence barely a month before the election.\n\nYou're correct that it's chaotic.

I've been tracking all the numbers across the remaining states.\n\nThis afternoon I had Biden needing to take 63% of the remaining vote in GA...and as of the latest counts, he only needs 56% of the remaining ballots. Every one of the lowest reported counties I'm seeing here on the map is a very heavy blue district.\n\nThere's close to 68,500 votes remaining in several blue counties that are only 84-86% reported, and with Biden leads of +17, +24, +37, +71 points in them.\n\nHe's only down by 23,000 in the entire state right now.\n\n***Edit: Just finished my code here to scrape the reported county data from the web, and it looks like Biden is set to close the gap by around 35,000 votes in GA. That will give him the state.***\n\nThen you've got another three huge blue counties that are 96-97% reported, ~47,000 votes left to go with Biden leading those places +14, +18, +46 points.\n\n____________\n\nI think he will take PA too. When PA was 80% reported, Biden needed to get 66.7% of the remaining votes to win the state. Now PA is 89% reported and Biden only needs 60.7% of the remaining votes. The vast majority of those left overs are in Philadelphia county and Allegheny county which have so far voted 80% and 58% Biden.\n\n___________\n\nThis is where Trump's dumbass strategy of telling his supporters to ONLY vote in person is going to eat his ass alive. He's basically ensured that the only possible changes in vote totals as this goes on are going to be changes that make him look worse and worse. There isn't going to be a single state at this point where his % actually increases now as the votes all get counted and tallied...and in fact there's clearly another two states he might very well lose.\n\nI really think that GA and PA will turn blue based on all the numbers I'm compiling here.\n\nNorth Carolina probably won't flip though. Biden would need 64% of the remaining votes which would be a +28pt lead. He's down by 76K, and looking at the least reported 20 counties here...he'll pick up ~103K and Trump will pick up 66K. It's not gonna happen.",

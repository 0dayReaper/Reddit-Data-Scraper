Jury nullification has nothing to do with whether or not the jury is acting in good faith or not. \n\nJury nullification means a not guilty verdict by a jury cannot be overturned by a judge. That\u2019s it. A judge can overturn a guilty verdict, they cannot overturn a not guilty verdict.\n\nThe specific scenario being painted in this thread would be acting in bad faith but remember a jury verdict requires unanimity.",

Last time Trump did some judge-shopping by filing outside of his home jurisdiction. This time she was assigned because she had previous familiarity with the case. She really can't do much for Trump at the arraignment. Her job is to read the charges, ask Trump how he pleads, and determine if there will be pre-trial detention. She can't really do any favors for Trump except for that last bit and the DOJ is likely not even going to ask for it. If she is assigned as the trial judge, the DOJ can very easily move to have her replaced with a judge that the defendant did not personally appoint to the bench.",

If it is within her power (and maybe even if it's not) to cause a delay or create a procedural out for Trump, recent history makes me lean towards betting that she'll go for it. That's just my opinion on it though and I get how serious the indictments look for Trump and that, on paper, the current phase should just be a series of mundane prodedural steps.\n\nEdit: I also believe the DOJ most probably has ways to remedy almost anything inappropriate that Cannon try to pull, but she should be no where near this case.",

There is a pending Supreme Court ruling on just that.\n\nHowever, what we know, for a fact based on the indictment and the evidence therein, is this should be in ANY court a complete slam dunk. So I look at it 2 ways:\n\n1 - This should absolutely result in a conviction. In the middle of MAGA country. With a MAGA judge. This kills any argument of bias.\n\n2 - If 1 doesn't happen, any sane person will know why. And my hope is there is enough sanity left that keeps him from ever holding office again.\n\nIn terms of simply delaying it till after the election - bad idea. This would be a huge anchor around the entire republican field up until then Nov. 2024. We ALREADY have R leadership calling for violence. Trump's absolute best bet is for a fast trial and be found not guilty. But I think it will be even harder to find one juror who wouldn't be adamant to convict that finding one that won't. So next best case is a mistrial and it gets retried.",

Delays are 100% coming so they may as well just taken the steps that are good for them. \n\nSeparately Judge Cannon has already shown poor judgement and has a history that compromises integrity. She literally is on record as a pro-Trump activist. It is ludicrous that she would be allowed anywhere near this case. The DOJ isn't making a case against her for the sake of optics.

There's an argument a crime involving documents taken from DC to Florida can be tried in either state. It's even possible they could bring related but separate charges for the same documents in DC if need be. And they also didn't charge for every document, so there are charges for other documents they can definitely bring elsewhere.\n\n&gt;The optics do not matter. This is a legal proceeding. DOJ exposes themselves to actually being biased when they preoccupy themselves with the arguments of pundits and partisans.\n\nWhere they have and exercise discretion, optics *do* matter. Charging these crimes in Florida isn't some absurd idea, like if they had done it in Hawaii or some other place with no nexus to the crimes alleged. The documents were stored in Florida, seized in Florida, shown to others in Florida, moved around like a shell game to avoid being returned in Florida. It's maybe not true that the case *had* to be tried in Florida, but there's no argument it *couldn't* be tried in Florida, either. So if it looks good *and* it undermines some of Trump's anticipated fuckery, *and* it's proper, why *shouldn't* DOJ do it?",

Sadly, there isn't anything in the Florida indictment that mentions listening devices or other warrants for electronics. \n\nIt seems like such a dumb move for the Special Counsel to not do a no-knock warrant to search Bedminster. I would think they would have done *something*, at least from an intelligence perspective, to stop him. But no, the Saudis paid Kushner $2B for..something.",

That if successful with a conviction, the DOJ can loop in the entirety of the crimes / documents to enhance the sentence.\n\n5.  That even if they draw \u201cloose Cannon\u201d as trial judge, there\u2019s some procedure in place to fast track appellate rulings during the trial.  The DOJ doesn\u2019t have to wait until the end of the trial to file appeals.  This happened during the special master proceedings and Cannon was overruled every time.",

The idea, I believe, is that if they do the trial here, with these people, then it will look as non-biased as they can make it and that it\u2019ll show how indisputable and airtight their case is if even these people admit that it is. They are confident that the evidence is so good that it will sway even them. Problem is, it has been shown time and time again that the MAGA crowd is fine denying reality and sticking to their guns no matter how obviously wrong they are. And that\u2019s because they know that Trump committed crimes and just don\u2019t care because they like him. When Judge Cannon demanded a Special Master last year she basically outright admitted that she knew it didn\u2019t make sense but she didn\u2019t care. That should tell you all you need to know about what she\u2019s gonna do here. It doesn\u2019t matter how airtight the case is, these people are too detached from reality to change their minds.",

They care about Big D\\*ck Energy - the \"Ultimate Alpha Male\" image.  And that is where Trump has them hoodwinked.\n\nIt needs to be yelled out and spelled out by everyone, Trump is a loser.  He managed to squander his \"jump start\" money from his dad, which was a cool $400M, giving him 5 bankruptcies - everything he's touched has gone bust, forcing him to do a Reality TV show as a list ditch effort to keep on grifting.\n\nHe had no clue what he was doing as POTUS, the only thing he understood was how to grift, and he makes for a piss poor criminal as well!  His attempt to steal national defense information was just down right bafoonish, and he deserves to be made a laughing stock for it.\n\nMake him a laughing stock and the MAGA will slink away with their tails tucked in.",

That man has indirectly killed hundreds of thousands of Americans by waging a culture war against the CDC. He openly prefers Putin and Kim Jong-Un. He'd rather leave NATO than to support Ukraine. He has been proven, ahead of his trial, that he willfully and knowingly took nuclear secrets.\n\n\nAnd yet the GOP won't abandon him. While certainly a lot fewer in numbers, you still have complete ignoramuses under every political article who genuinely believe he is innocent, that this is just a witch hunt. What in the ever-loving fuck is needed to break this cult?",

In that case, if Trump is in prison, you would need to convince &lt;5% of Trump voters on average that he cannot be President from prison (yes, I know that's not in the Constitution), cannot win a general election from prison and trust that DeSantis will pardon Trump. \n\n-----\n\nThis debate about being in prison prior to March 2024 is kind of mute anyway if the Appellate Court chooses not to replace Judge Cannon. It's not a certanty. I fully expect Cannon to delay the trial until November 2024 at the earliest, despite the fact that 6 months is plenty of time and the prosecution is only asking for 21 days to make their case. The only way I see Cannon making an earlier court date is if she was planning to seat a jury and then immediately rule in favor of Trump.",

If they are brazen enough to attack journalists on camera, with thousands of witnesses, I can't even imagine how many videos there are of police misconduct against protesters.

I get to choose if I am going to protest or stay out of it. I'm not forced to deal with the reality of prejudices.\n\nThere are a number of my peers who clutch their pearls and fret at the screens, shocked at the outrageous acts they aren't having to endure. These people aren't technically racist and certainly aren't violent; but by merit of their silence and/or inaction they are complicit.\n\n*That* is what needs to change. We can't fix these systemic and cultural failings if we keep settling for the metaphorical devil that we know. The complacent majority is enabling the corruption in exchange for business as usual. Entitled people rise up *with firearms in hand* demanding that their conveniences be uninterrupted; yet when their neighbors' neighbors are openly oppressed and fucking *killed* the rhetoric instantly switches to \"hey, let's all calm down.\"\n\nAmerica's mission statement is diversity. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Most of us see that as an ongoing pursuit -- an ideal to expand and refine until everyone is safe and full of opportunity.\n\nIt's the vile, selfish, short-sighted assholes mixed into our population who poison, exploit, and corrode our good faith and hard-fought social progress. *They* give our country a bad name. *They* are the domestic threat. *They* thrive on the worst of humanity's vulnerabilities and pat themselves on the back when they profit from it.\n\nThe insulated people like myself must use the power of our privilege to defend the oppressed. We cannot remain silent nor inactive. We don't need to resort to violence to overcome the rot, but we *do* need to exercise the peaceful powers we have to create constructive pressure.\n\nAmerica is supposedly the richest country in the world. There's no reason for our resources to be allocated away from making EVERY citizen's life better instead of.... This.",

And whether we directly participated in that or were simply a member of a culture that at one time normalized that behavior, it shaped us. We can\u2019t undo that level of dehumanizing in one or two generations. I believe Black Lives Matter is a movement to rehumanize black citizens. All lives matter, but not all lives need to be pulled back into moral inclusion. Not all people were subjected to the psychological process of demonizing and being made less than human so we could justify the inhumane practice of slavery.",

Then they were emancipated, but it still took a civil war and several years for everyone to be nominally free. The people who needed slaves to make and keep their money found other ways to keep the same system under a different name - for a while, it was share cropping. Now that we're not super agricultural anymore, it's prison work programs. \n\nOur police system's roots were in slave catching. Even northern cities' cops were required at points to capture and send back escaped slaves. Now they just round people up for whatever they think they can make stick, whether it be true or not, and stick them in cages to make license plates and other assorted goods.\n\nIt's about the money, in the end. People who can't get their labor's worth out of a product are great for the people who want to extract more money than they can actually make themselves.",

The program also targeted the Ku Klux Klan in 1964.[8]\n\n&gt; **In 1971 in San Diego, the FBI financed, armed, and controlled an extreme right-wing group of former members of the Minutemen anti-communist para-military organization, transforming it into a group called the Secret Army Organization that targeted groups, activists, and leaders involved in the Anti-War Movement, using both intimidation and violent acts.[9][10][11]**\n\n&gt; The FBI has used covert operations against domestic political groups since its inception; however, covert operations under the official COINTELPRO label took place between 1956 and 1971.[12] COINTELPRO tactics are still used to this day and have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare; smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media; harassment; wrongful imprisonment; and illegal violence, including assassination.[13][14][15][16] The FBI's stated motivation was \"protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order\".[17]\n\n&gt; **Beginning in 1969, leaders of the Black Panther Party were targeted by the COINTELPRO and \"neutralized\" by being assassinated, imprisoned, publicly humiliated or falsely charged with crimes. Some of the Black Panthers affected included Fred Hampton, Mark Clark, Zayd Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu-Jamal,[18] and Marshall Conway. Common tactics used by COINTELPRO were perjury, witness harassment, witness intimidation, and withholding of evidence.[19][20][21]**\n\n&gt; FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover issued directives governing COINTELPRO, ordering FBI agents to \"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize\" the activities of these movements and especially their leaders.[22][23] Under Hoover, the agent in charge of COINTELPRO was William C. Sullivan.[24] Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy personally authorized some of the programs.[25] Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of Martin Luther King's phones \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\",[26] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[27]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\n\nModern:\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2020/01/20/political-surveillance-police-activists-tennessee/\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2018/03/19/black-lives-matter-fbi-surveillance/",

And Hampton wasn't the only person they murdered that night. [From the wikipedia article on Fred Hampton:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton#1969_raid_and_death)\n\n&gt;The FBI, determined to prevent any enhancement of the BPP leadership's effectiveness, decided to set up an arms raid on Hampton's Chicago apartment. Informant William O'Neal provided them with detailed information about Hampton's apartment, including the layout of furniture and the bed in which Hampton and his girlfriend slept. An augmented, 14-man team of the SAO (Special Prosecutions Unit) was organized for a pre-dawn raid; they were armed with a search warrant for illegal weapons.[\n...\nO'Neal had slipped the barbiturate sleep agent secobarbitol into a drink that Hampton consumed during the dinner, in order to sedate Hampton so he would not awaken during the subsequent raid. O'Neal left at this point, and, at about 1:30 a.m., December 4, Hampton fell asleep mid-sentence talking to his mother on the telephone.[21][22][23][24] Although Hampton was not known to take drugs, Cook County chemist Eleanor Berman would report that she ran two separate tests which each showed evidence of barbiturates in Hampton's blood. An FBI chemist would later fail to find similar traces, but Berman stood by her findings. \n...\nAt 4:00 a.m., the heavily armed police team arrived at the site, divided into two teams, eight for the front of the building and six for the rear. At 4:45 a.m., they stormed into the apartment. Mark Clark, sitting in the front room of the apartment with a shotgun in his lap, was on security duty. The police shot him in the chest, killing him instantly.[28] An alternative account said that Clark answered the door and police immediately shot him. Either way, Clark's gun discharged once into the ceiling.[29] This single round was fired when he suffered a reflexive death-convulsion after being shot. This was the only shot fired by the Panthers.[11][30][31]\nHampton, drugged by barbiturates, was sleeping on a mattress in the bedroom with his fianc\u00e9e, Deborah Johnson, who was nine months pregnant with their child.[28] She was forcibly removed from the room by the police officers while Hampton still lay unconscious in bed.[32] Then, the raiding team fired at the head of the south bedroom. Hampton was wounded in the shoulder by the shooting.\nFellow Black Panther Harold Bell said that he heard the following exchange:\n\"That's Fred Hampton.\"\n\"Is he dead?... Bring him out.\"\n\"He's barely alive.\"\n\"He'll make it.\"[33]\nThe injured Panthers said they heard two shots. According to Hampton's supporters, the shots were fired point blank at Hampton's head.[34] According to Deborah Johnson, an officer then said:\n\"He's good and dead now.\"[3\n\nThe other Panthers present were wounded, arrested, and charged. All of those charges were later dropped. \n\nFred Hampton was assassinated.",

Got to see some fuck wad bring a bow to a protest only to draw AND shoot it into the crowd and proceed to get the fuck beat out of him... then turn around and go to fox news and cry about the evil anti-fa. THEN we got to see a vid capture of cops setting up bricks to preemptively blame protesters for violence when they went to go and start blasting. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9e8-apENs normally don't suggest watching a 3ish hour show about this sort of thing.

In order to be a LEO, you must possess that license. The inspector body in #1 can revoke the license.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Refocus police resources on training &amp; de-escalation instead of purchasing military equipment and require encourage LEOs to be from the community they police.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Adopt the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d doctrine for lethal force as implemented in other states. Use of force is automatically investigated by #1.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060Codify into law the requirement for police to have positive control over the evidence chain of custody. If the chain of custody is lost for evidence, the investigative body in #1 can hold the LEO/LE liable.\n\nThese 5 demands are the minimum necessary for trust in our police to return.

The two worst times he was at point blank range and tried to get my face, but he got my neck because I turned away.  The second time he tried to sneak to my side and get me, but I still turned.  The second time he put the canister in either in my hair while spraying or it malfunctioned because it stopped spraying mist and just gurgled out liquid all over my neck and upper back.  That first night, I was covered in mace and pepperball residue.  I wasn't aware that water activates the chemicals.  I was already burning when I got home, but I have never screamed and cried like that before.  I wasn't able to finish cleaning myself before the pain became too much.  My entire body was on fire for some amount of time that was inconceivable to me during the process.  I was too scared to shower for another 48 hours or so.  I still didn't get it all off then.  My elbows still had residue last night and burned when I showered.  \n\nI never once made an aggressive move towards the cops.  I have been brutally punished for nothing.  Many of you know me in person.  Please take my word that the first three nights were filled with pointless police brutality.  This is why we're protesting.\"",

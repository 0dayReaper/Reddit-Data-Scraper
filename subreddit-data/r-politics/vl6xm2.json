There have been many claims that Clarence can still be impartial, including among conservatives. This is bullshit, because Ginni is directly involved in matters relating to the Supreme Court. Republicans will also say \"Well that's not true.\"\n\nWell then [why did Ginni feel the need to apologize to the SCOTUS clerks?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ginni-thomas-apology-clarence-thomas-clerks-trump-rally/2021/02/02/a9818cce-6496-11eb-8c64-9595888caa15_story.html)\n\n&gt; Conservative political activist Virginia Thomas told her husband Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s former law clerks that she was sorry for a rift that developed among them **after her election advocacy of President Donald Trump and endorsement of the Jan. 6 rally in D.C.** that resulted in violence and death at the Capitol.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI owe you all an apology. **I have likely imposed on you my lifetime passions,**\u201d Thomas, who goes by Ginni, recently wrote to a private Thomas Clerk World email list of her husband\u2019s staff over his three decades on the bench.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cMy passions and beliefs are likely shared with the bulk of you, but certainly not all. And sometimes the smallest matters can divide loved ones for too long. Let\u2019s pledge to not let politics divide THIS family, and learn to speak more gently and knowingly across the divide.\u201d\n\nShe actively admitted that she's imposing her personal beliefs on SCOTUS clerks and has been for *several decades*. And she's been doing this from a position which she was neither elected nor appointed, and she's been doing it covertly. Now she is trying to cover it all up and pretend it's not incredibly wrong by playing \"let's all just be friends/we're a family\" card after an *attempted coup which she actively supported and espoused*.\n\n***BUT WAIT! THERE IS MORE:***\n\nAlso, for those not already aware, Supreme Court clerkships are almost *always* a fast-track to becoming a Judge, and is simply a matter of major prestige for lawyers in general. Of all the Federal Judges out there, especially Circuit Courts, a significant number of them had a clerkship at SCOTUS.\n\nTurns out, [Clarence's clerks have been funneled upwards more than *any other judge's*.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/clarence-thomas-trump/593596/) And it was done during Trump's administration.\n\n&gt; Numbers are the first evidence of the sizable Thomas effect. He has had more of his former clerks nominated to federal judgeships under Trump than any other justice, past or present: 10, compared with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s seven and Scalia\u2019s five. Roughly one-fifth of Thomas\u2019s former clerks either are in the Trump administration or have been nominated to the federal bench by the president. The clerks whom Thomas trained, has mentored, and actively stays in touch with are taking up lifetime appointments, and on the whole, they are quite young: Allison Jones Rushing, who now sits on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, is just in her mid-30s.\n\nIt's abundantly clear that Clarence and Ginni Thomas have been directly influencing our entire legal system without **any** recourse or redress from the American public, and they've been doing it with the specific intent of corrupting it to the advantage of one political party and their agenda.\n\nAnd as if that's not enough, they have been doing it covertly, and Ginni, when caught with her hand in the cookie jar, is trying to paint herself as totally innocent while Republicans and Clarence have been pretending that there's nothing wrong with it and that Clarence can still be objective.",

His opponent is a famous football player with giant name recognition.\n\nHerschel Walker may be a famous football player, but he's not necessarily a beloved celebrity in Georgia or even among Black Georgians. Walker has been known for saying some really wackadoodle shit for quite a long time, while Warnock is a respected pastor known for being a champion of social justice issues.\n\nI think the Republican Party is being quite cynical if they think name recognition and Walker being Black will pull enough Black voters from the Democratic party to garner a Republican win. I'm not a political strategest, but this seems to be what they're attempting.",

These are things like *Brown v. Board of Education.* Or the 1803 case of *Marbury v. Madison*. \n\nThen when she was asked if she considered Roe to be a super-precedent **she explicitly said no**, and cited the uncomfortable fact that politicians across the country have been calling for its over-turn since the moment it was it was decided.\n\n[Source: CSPAN  (Video on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1316086827279945728)",

Heck they can even say they have no current plans to overturn Roe vs Wade and change their mind 5 seconds after being confirmed.\n\nThis is why liberal senators kept pressing them to elaborate on Roe v Wade and why they kept repeating the same generic lines about the \"law of the land\" the senators and nominees know its meaningless statement of fact without any opinion but technically half-answers the question.\n\nThis is a total non-starter.

Republicans will likely lose election after election unless they cheat, and they have reached that point already, with gerrymandering and everything they tried to do last presidential election. And when that happens, the people will take to the streets and reform the constitution. We\u2019re close to that point imo. History has seen revolutions like this happen countless times. Democracies must renew themselves to stay healthy, and the US is way overdue with its broken and antiquated political system.",

The Court would be more balanced, but it would still be just as political, and everything could be undone when the next justice drops dead.",

Roe vs Wade was horribly justified from a legal sense in the 1973 decision and as a result it makes perfect sense for the current court to overturn it. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion even specifically pointed out that the case should have been derived from the 9th amendment rather than the shaky grounds upon which it was argued. It's a miracle that the 1973 court decided as it did back then. \n\nOne should ask AOC and the rest of congress why \\*they\\* don't do the right thing and pass a constitutional amendment enumerating an individual's body as a right explicitly enumerated under the constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court didn't make a law. It's the congressional branch that has failed to make that law and it is they we should be looking to blame at least as much.",

So you'd have to have (*edit: admissible*) evidence of what they believed. That might be tough when it comes to opinions or personal beliefs versus quantifiable facts.",

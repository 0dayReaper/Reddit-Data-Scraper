We produce enough food, have plenty of energy, plenty of water, and plenty of housing.  The problem with each is that we have commercialized the resources, and artificially inflated their value.  Localized shortages, like the water shortage in the midwest, are manufactured problems that are a direct result of unregulated capitalistic exploitation of what should have been shared resources.  \n\nThe actual shortage is people.  Young people aren't reproducing fast enough to support the old people who stop being productive.  And again, we have sufficient resources to care for everyone, but we have commercialized aging itself, and the systems we have in place to support retirees are based on the idea of infinite population growth.  Add to that the cartoonishly evil approach to immigration that has been implemented, and we run the risk of actually shrinking the population.",

They don't realize that there is just as much political fighting within the parties as there is between the parties - especially dems, since they are a big tent party who represent almost everyone who isn't a conservative white Christian. \n\nPeople also don't seem to realize that politicians have to serve their voters enough to get re-elected. If Manchin turned into a progressive, he'd lose his next election and a very conservative Republican would take over. In WV, he absolutely has to side with conservatives on a number of issues. A Republican would be way worse. \n\nFurther, people blame the other politicians in the party for someone like Sinema - despite the voters being the ones who chose her. Because of all the Bernie/Hillary disinfo and propaganda, people think that the DNC chooses who gets to run (of course they have influence but ultimately the voters choose). \n\nOn top of all that, people don't realize that even when a party has a small majority they have to do all kinds of shit to placate the other side for various reasons. Most people don't even know how the minority party can hold a bill hostage in committee or slow judicial or cabinet appointments down to a crawl. \n\nVoter ignorance is the real reason we don't have better politicians, too. If we all knew everything about the process and the things being voted on, there would not be much disagreement. On most issues there is a pretty clear \"best path\" to take. Only on some things like abortion does it get really muddy, and even then it's not that murky - we've seen what works and what doesn't here and abroad for centuries. It's just a \"moral\" issue, but people don't even understand *that* part of it. \n\nMost issues are like climate change. We know for a fact that climate change is real and man made, and we even know exactly how to stop/limit it. But folks think that since there is a lot of debate about it online, it must be up in the air. That the facts aren't all in and it's just a matter of opinion or speculation. \n\nI hate to sound elitist, but I've come to find out from talking to people that the VAST majority of voters are almost completely ignorant about almost everything when it comes to politics. And I freely admit that even I don't know nearly as much as I should, despite it being a kind of obsession of mine.",

It would be produced and sold whether there is a pipeline or not. The pipeline just means that trains and trucks won't have to burn diesel to move it. \n\n2. LNG is the cleanest fossil fuel there is. It does not really compete with things like solar energy. It competes with gasoline and diesel, so more LNG would mean less gasoline and diesel, not fewer solar panels or windmills.\n\n3. It won't affect the price of LNG by any significant amount anyway, since this pipeline will just move like 0.5% of the world's LNG from West Virginia to Virginia. \n\n4. There is literally no way to get a carbon tax from this. This is like saying that they should just attach M4A to the next budget reconciliation bill or something - it's just jibberish. It's on the level of when Trump said as president he'd just repeal the 14th amendment.\n\nSo you see, this pipeline will only have the effect of lowering carbon emissions.

And the debt ceiling deal is a good example of why. Austerity just isn't that popular. \n\nAs for whether we could have make this tax credit permanent? Idk, the media did everything it could to normalize Manchin for blocking it. Hard to believe some other Democrat would mind being called a \"moderate\" for taking Manchin's spot here.",

I'd like to believe if Manchin knew he would be framed as a radical high tax liberal who puts foreign investors ahead of Americans, he wouldn't have gone as far to the dark side. But when he can be rewarded by even so called liberal media and called \"moderate\" for putting foreigners ahead of Americans, sure he is going to do that.",

This year is running about half as much as last year.  I've heard the same from other small biz friends.  It helped take the edge off life for many people and allowed them to support their local economies and beyond. We also recieved our portion for our own two children which of course was nice.",

So what if someone wants to dress up as the opposite gender and put on a show? It\u2019s not hurting anyone, if you don\u2019t want to watch then don\u2019t, doesn\u2019t mean no one should be allowed to.\n\nI don\u2019t like Brussel sprouts, doesn\u2019t mean I think they should be illegal, I\u2019m straight, doesn\u2019t mean I think people should only be allowed to be straight.

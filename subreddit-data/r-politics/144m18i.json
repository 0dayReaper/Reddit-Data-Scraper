An awful lot of men are, either consciously or subconsciously, aware of male privilege, as evidenced by their aversion to gender equality.

Shit's stressful enough without making up a tangled web of a persecution conspiracy to blame when a woman is better than a man at something.\n\nIt's fucking weird to just assume that men automatically deserve to reign. Why the fuck are men deciding women's rights? Like y'all are just children who aren't responsible enough to make your own decisions? Fucking weird and gross. I bet they treat their wives and girlfriends like pets, and they see nothing wrong with that.",

K is *really* looking forwards to get off of spiro.\n   - K will likely be depressed heavily for a month or two afterwards while rebalancing hormones. she might need a small amount of testosterone gel every few days to stay healthy.\n      - ovaries produce testosterone! as do adrenal glands. unfortunately she doesn't have ovaries and adrenal glands don't produce more than a fraction of what ovaries do.\n\nI really, really hope she can get this surgery: unfortunately, she was fired (she was going to quit soon as the project already had over 100% staff turnover) and is having more difficulty than she should finding a new job with health insurance.",

I don\u2019t disagree with the first half, that Black folks have had it the worst in America, it\u2019s undeniable. But, when we let our pain fester, anyone can be seduced by bigotry.",

My wife and I were hanging out with a bunch of lesbian friends who we'd only ever known to be open-minded and accepting when the topic of bisexuality came up, and without skipping a beat half of them started talking about how much they hate bisexual people, with more genuine disdain in their voices than I'd ever heard before from them about anything. Being from the South, it felt exactly like when white racists think they're in a safe space with you and drop their masks.\n\nThe LGBTQ community is generally one of the most accepting and wonderful communities that I've known, but having to come to terms with the idea that even the groups most victimised by bigots have their own bigotry was a hard pill to swallow as a young idealist. I've come to realise that the parts of the community I like the most by far are the ally and ally-embracing parts, as most people there bond over acceptance and love rather than individual identity.",

                            "comment": "&gt;...After forty years of studying Cather, I came to the conclusion that she was born intersex. This meant that she had no choice when it came to her gender identity; that decision was made for her at birth. The main difference between transgender and intersex people lies in the issue of \u201cbodily autonomy.\u201d Some of the same surgeries most often sought by (and sometimes denied to) transgender individuals are forced on intersex babies and children, mainly to fit a doctor's pre-conceived notion of how they should look. These early surgeries often make necessary more and more intricate medical treatment as a result of the hormonal and reconstructive alterations that have been done to their bodies.  Some intersex people end up not having language for their body parts, accounting for Willa Cather\u2019s fear that her organs would never measure up, if she were to \u201cundergo a searching physical examination.\u201d\n\n&gt;I believe a Civil War doctor named William S. Love surgically altered the firstborn infant of Virginia and Charles Cather, the baby who had first been called \u201cWillie,\u201d in honor of men named William on both sides of the family. This fact might have been completely obscured by fear and secrecy in the family, especially after the child grew up and became a famous author, but for the courage of a woman named Mildred Bennett, who chose to write the truth, as close as she could get to it, in her landmark biography, The World of Willa Cather, published in 1951.\n\n&gt;Bennett, as well as every other Cather biographer for the first forty years after Cather\u2019s death in 1947, was consigned to writing about her subject in stilted terms, certainly never broaching the subject of gender identity, and only gradually coming to terms with what appeared to be Cather\u2019s sexual orientation, as a \u201cwoman-loving woman,\u201d in the language of my generation. Mildred Bennett never allowed herself, during the entire decade of our friendship, to say what people in Red Cloud, Nebraska, called Cather. \n\n&gt;Spelled phonetically, the word was first presented to me as \u201cmorpheedite.\u201d I mulled it over for decades after Mildred\u2019s death in 1989, until Willa Cather\u2019s letters began to be published in 2013.\n\n&gt;By 2018, I had followed enough tendrils that I could begin to weave the tapestry of Cather\u2019s life in a new pattern. I drew on the lives of transgender people as well as intersex individuals in doing my research, because I found it fascinating to study how gender identity can fluctuate, over a lifetime. This was certainly true of Willa Cather, and it fully informed the \u201clessons\u201d she learned in life, valuable ways of being that I hope will be a comfort to current and future generations of \u201cwomen-loving women,\u201d as well as intersex and transgender people whose identity may be more challenging to define. For example, I came to believe that Cather was not what I called in the book \u201ca garden-variety lesbian,\u201d but that her identity was more complex than that. Certainly, she loved women, but because in her early life, up to and through puberty, she identified mostly as male, her response to feminine beauty has puzzled her readers and critics for decades.\n\n&gt;To read novels such as My Antonia and short stories from \u201cTommy, the Unsentimental\u201d to \u201cThe Old Beauty,\u201d is to begin your own journey with Willa Cather and the fascinating ways in which her experiments in gender identification and sexual orientation played out in her work. It must have been painfully confusing at times, to be \u201cWillie\u201d and then \u201cWilella,\u201d (a name her mother realized would never stick, by the time her child was fourteen months old, probably as a result of the surgery Dr. Love had performed). Virginia Cather changed it immediately to \u201cWilla\u201d The self-assigned name became fully \u201cWilliam\u201d during college, but after being embarrassed by bullying on the University of Nebraska campus, Cather went back to the familiar, signing her letters \u201cWillie\u201d and preferring to be called that early name all the rest of her life by those who knew her best.\n\n&gt;She may have settled into \u201cWilla\u201d as her pseudonym, more or less, after identifying strongly with the great \u201cGeorges\u201d of literature, especially George Sand, whose image she kept over her mantle throughout her life. Clearly, she had been defined and designed as a girl, by Dr. Love, and by each succeeding doctor in her life (she and her mother were exceedingly close to Dr. Love in Virginia and to Dr. McKeeby in Red Cloud) and by the medical teams who worked on her \u201ccondition\u201d at the Mayo Clinic. Her letters show at least two extended visits to the famous research facility in Rochester, Minnesota, one sometime in 1912-15, and the other in 1928.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201025100735/https://www.bettyjeansteinshouerbooks.com/blog/no-willa-cather-was-not-transgender",

Cather was \"claimed\" by lesbian historians who glossed over Cather's love affair with a man and literary oeuvre that included writing about gay male love as well as heterosexual romances. Sometimes historians get a little to eager to see a pattern and are blinded by their own biases while the truth is a bit more complicated. Btw Cather's crossdressing is well known to literary historians. \n\nUnfortunately there's also a history of lesbian scholars \"claiming\" any gender non conforming woman, passing woman (including cis heterosexuals), female to male transsexual (including a doctor who was an early HRT patient and explicitly trans), and butch (of whom many simply do not identify as women or with the gender binary) as lesbians. And that's just not the case that all those people are lesbians, but now when more thorough or balanced scholarship is done you still have people defending that older narrative to the death.",

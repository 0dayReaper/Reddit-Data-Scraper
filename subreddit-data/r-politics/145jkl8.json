Did you read the last few paragraphs?\n\n&gt;For months, advocates have criticized the Biden administration for opting to use more limited emergency authority under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROES) Act of 2003 instead of invoking the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cancel federal student loan debt, which is carried by more than 40 million people in the U.S.\n\nFollowed by\n\n\n&gt;In June 2021, more than a year before Biden unveiled his debt relief plan, the Debt Collective released a draft executive order that would cancel all outstanding federal student loan debt using Higher Education Act authority.\n\n&gt;\"President Biden can cancel all federal student loan debt with a simple executive order. So, we wrote the entire executive order for him,\" the group said at the time. \"It's not a magic trick. With the flick of his pen, he can make all federal student loan debt disappear.\"\n\n\nSo he's trying to use an act passed by Congress. Not an executive order. So if this fails he can still whip out an EO",

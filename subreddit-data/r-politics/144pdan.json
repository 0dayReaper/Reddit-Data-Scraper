She eventually discusses anti-vaxxers, Qanon, and Trump fanatics.\n\nThe short version is that for people like your friend, being a Trump supporter and an anti-vaxxer is their identity and source of validation. Letting go of those beliefs and leaving those communities means also letting go of how they see themselves and subjecting themselves to rejection and ridicule. Nobody wants to feel lost, wrong, and unwanted. Pushing folks to stop being part of \"cult-like\" groups won't work unless those folks have some other source of community and validation to fall back on -- a support network of some kind, like their old friends or family.",

Then there was the DOJ peacefully searching Mar-a-lago in June 2022. Trump still didn't give everything back at this point.

            "comment": "Special Counsel Jack Smith's classified documents investigation into former president Trump has lead to the federal indictment of a president for the first time in American history. So how did we get here?\n\nBelow are the sequence of events in chronological order following the lawful search warrant to recover classified materials from Mar-A-Lago. The Department of Justice is investigating Trump for mishandling hundreds of classified documents.\n\n1. Federal Judge Reinhart - A federal magistrate judge in South Florida who signed off on the Mar-a-Lago search warrant as the Justice Department investigates Trump mishandling classified documents.^[[1]](https://globalnews.ca/news/9048549/fbi-obtain-search-warrant-trump-mar-a-lago/)\n\n2. District Judge Cannon - A lower court judge appointed by Trump. Trump's lawyers used her to delay the Department of Justice investigation of Trump mishandling classified documents. She made very questionable decisions including ordering a stay (stop) on the investigation and appointing a special master to review all the documents.^[[2]](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/20/how-judge-aileen-cannon-broke-with-conservatives-00057647)\n\n3. Special Master Judge Dearie - A Reagan appointed  judge from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He also served as a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) from 2012 to 2019. Judge Dearie is known as a very fair judge and is historically respected by both Republicans and Democrats. Trump's team and the DoJ provided Judge Cannon with a shortlist of judges to be the Special Master, however they  only agreed on Judge Dearie.^[[3]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62893028) Judge Dearie questioned the authority of District Court Judge Cannon and demanded to see evidence of Trump's outlandish allegations such as the FBI  planting evidence.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/special-master-trump-privilege.html)\n\n4. 11^th Circuit Court of Appeals - Has jurisdiction over Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. A panel of 3 judges, including 2 Trump appointees, ruled in favour of the Justice Department and forced the lower court of Judge Cannon to reverse her decision on stopping/staying the investigation. The 11^th Circuit stayed portions of Judge Cannon's rulings, paving the way for the Justice Department to continue their investigation into Trump mishandling classified documents.^[[5]](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-grants-dojs-request-partial-stay-judges/story?id=90296433) Furthermore, the 11^th Circuit ordered the end of the Special Master review of the documents, removing a hurdle that hindered the Justice Department's criminal investigation of Trump.^[[6]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-appeals-court-halts-special-master-review-of-trumps-mar-a-lago-documents) The judicial decision handed down by the Appeals Court, pay particular attention to pages 20 and 21. The 11^th Circuit said that District Judge Cannon was completely wrong and that no one, including a former President, is above the law.^[[7]](https://lawandcrime.com/trump/the-answer-is-no-conservative-11th-circuit-panel-including-two-judges-trump-appointed-puts-a-stop-to-special-masters-mar-a-lago-review/)\n\n5. Following the ruling by the conservative leaning Federal Appeals Court, Trump appointed District Court Judge Cannon ended the special master review, paving the way for the investigation into the former president mishandling highly classified documents to continue.^[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/trump-special-master-case.html)\n\n________\n\n\n1) [Global News - FBI followed this checklist to obtain search warrant for Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago](https://globalnews.ca/news/9048549/fbi-obtain-search-warrant-trump-mar-a-lago/)\n\n2) [Politico - How Judge Cannon broke with conservatives in Trump documents case](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/20/how-judge-aileen-cannon-broke-with-conservatives-00057647)\n\n3) [BBC - Raymond Dearie: Who is the special master reviewing seized Trump files?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62893028)\n\n4) [New York Times - In Documents Review, Special Master Tells Trump Team to Back Up Privilege Claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/special-master-trump-privilege.html)\n\n4) [ABC - DOJ can continue Trump classified docs investigation without special master: Appeals court](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-grants-dojs-request-partial-stay-judges/story?id=90296433)\n\n6) [PBS - Federal appeals court halts special master review of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-lago documents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-appeals-court-halts-special-master-review-of-trumps-mar-a-lago-documents)\n\n7) [Law and Crime - \u2018The Answer Is No\u2019: Conservative 11th Circuit Panel, Including Two Judges Trump Appointed, Puts a Stop to Special Master\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Review](https://lawandcrime.com/trump/the-answer-is-no-conservative-11th-circuit-panel-including-two-judges-trump-appointed-puts-a-stop-to-special-masters-mar-a-lago-review/)\n\n8) [New York Times - Special Master\u2019s Review in Trump Case Ends as Appeal Court\u2019s Ruling Takes Effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/trump-special-master-case.html)",

Let's not forget that the infamous Access Hollywood video was played during his deposition and he, pretty much, doubles down on the notion that rich and famous people should be able to freely commit sexual assault. \n\nJune 8th, 2023: Federal Prosecutors have indicted Trump for the misappropriation -IE: Theft- of classified Federal documents. \n\nSo, take all of these facts and keep in mind that *Trump is STILL the front runner for the Republican Primaries*.\n\nWhat.

Afterwards, he may be facing both the DOJ and Fulton County.\n\nIt's possible we could see someone running as the GOP nominee while facing three separate criminal trials. ..Possibly someone running for the GOP nominee as a convict.\n\nDesantis could catch up in polling, or the RNC could try to make a move to oust him, but this is all playing with fire. I could see someone like Trump threatening a third party, which he has [publicly suggested](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-2024-third-party-b2253265.html) already.",

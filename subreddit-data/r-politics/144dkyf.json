Yes that's tied to a purchase, but unless there's already a dark web site that can take those numbers and show the full receipt, you're not gonna get A LOT of info out of it. \n\nHow could you target one person if you could go hypothetically to the ATF's website, type in your zip code, and see all the registration numbers of guns in that zip code? If it was just a flat number, people would complain about that number being faked.",

The first step in understanding how to tackle gun violence in the US is to KNOW, not GUESS how many guns there are. Have a digital list of known gun registration numbers that can degrade over time would help, because then we can extrapolate more accurately a number of how many guns there are.",

Now we're probably NEVER gonna know the exact number, but knowing the number of legally obtained firearms in each zip code would at least help understanding how many guns could be in America.",

Once the gun is obtained either by police shooting the assailant dead or the assailant committing suicide after the attack, it would be useful to be able to cross check who owned the gun before it got to the assailant, and where it was purchased. Giving officers a useful tool to clamp down on a not insignificant source of guns used in crime. Now they can more easily cross reference who is supposed to own the firearm and where it was obtained, giving more people pause to not store them incorrectly. And I know you're going to talk about illegally obtained and manufactured guns, or guns with those identifiers scratched off, but the same principle applies to car owners whose car got stolen and the thief changed the license plate assuming they didn't just scrap it for parts. Or how you'll say \"well if they took it from family, the first thing the cops would do is just ask the parents\", but other people in this thread have made the poor argument about people using a hypothetical publicly accessible gun owner database as a shopping list for guns, assuming someone was both lucky and dumb enough to go into a stranger's home and steal the stranger's gun, now the police can reference said database and find the original owner. This is an area where it's more preventative where it's telling people now there's a tool to make cop's a little bit easier to find you, if your gun ended up being used in a crime if you weren't the one committing it, hopefully giving people more of a reason to store guns properly.",

It's very dangerous regardless to try and rob a house a perosn NEVER has been in before, hence why it's far more rare than someone's nephew stealing $100 from their aunt/uncle since they'd have SOME idea where that money is.\n\n&gt; Also, people would use this kind of a system the other way around.

Apparently they do NOT address it, because, literally, MORE PEOPLE ARE MUDERED BY GUNS IN CALIFORNIA THAN TEXAS.\n\nYOUR argument is that \"it's worth it\" for the drastically different laws, it offers safety and protection. I've now laid out what that actual safety and protection is. With Maths.  What the drastically different vastly stricter gun laws actually gets us, what this proposed amendment ACTUALLY does, if we extrapolate Texas Vs California, is an actual potential reduction of \\~0.1 murders per 100,000 people.\n\nI wholly understand it seems worth it to you, but as someone who lives with these laws and actually risks getting put in prison over these laws because, shocker, I decided I wanted to responsibly own and secure firearms, reducing \\~0.13 murders per 100,000 population doesn't seem like a really good gain for The Risk Of Felony Conviction For Noncomplaince With Complicated Arcane Laws.",

They should make it clear with broad language that the federal and state governments shall have the ability to regulate individual gun ownership and use with the interests of the security of a free state and the safety of its people in mind. (Maybe I am on the wrong track about this?)\n\nBut the idea of opening us up to a constitutional convention sounds insane to me. We'll open it up hoping to ban guns and wind up with Gilead from the Handmaid's Tale.",

None of this crap with red states forcing blue cities to give up their gun laws.  (This is in keeping with historical precedent, BTW.  Firearms permitted in the countryside were banned within many historical American cities.)\n\n\"Reasonable limits\" is kinda vague.  I really want something about arms appropriate to the location.

Among other benefits these countries typically have\n\n- better labor laws preventing companies from exploiting individuals and provide living wages\n- Free or cheap Healthcare versus uncapped costs which bankrupt otherwise successful people\n- Free or heavily discounted educations allowing each person to reach their full potential versus ballooning costs that take decades to pay back\n- Strong social safety nets so there's less fear of tomorrow\n\n\nBut whenever we talk about the problems in the US, the issue is always \"guns\".

And they will act as one voting block on this issue. The first of them entered politics with the 2022 midterms. In the next 8 years, they are likely to make up a huge section of candidates and voters. They are more politically active and informed than any prior generation. And an enormous reason for that is because almost every one of them knows someone who was killed by gun violence. \n\nThe old figures that showed people getting more conservative with age have already reversed. Each generation since the baby boomers has been more liberal than the last and now surveys are showing that they are becoming *more* liberal with age. \n\nThe age of the GOP is over.

But it\u2019s still probably extremely ineffective at doing so, and I don\u2019t agree with it as a primary method of reducing gun violence, for a number of reasons. \n\nI don\u2019t know what exactly training requirements do to counteract gun violence on any significant level further than the existing laws around them. Criminal negligence is still a thing. Accidental discharges and kids grabbing guns are incidents that do occur too often, but they\u2019re still fairly rare as a count of total gun deaths. I do believe gun owners should be regularly familiar with their firearms, and responsible in the manner they carry, operate, and store them. But the level of training required for that isn\u2019t much, and is usually pretty obvious: don\u2019t point at things you don\u2019t intend to shoot, don\u2019t let children use them, etc. \n\nRed flag laws are such a supremely difficult thing to deal with on the basis that an unjust government could easily use them to strip people of their rights without due process based on improper classifications of mental health concerns, etc. They sound good in theory, but rough in practice. \n\nWhat constitutes a red flag? The Nashville school shooter that was trans, do we classify that case as a red flag? Most trans people don\u2019t want to shoot up schools full of kids. But many trans people have gone through depression, gender dysphoria, feelings of societal outcast, etc. that could easily be deemed by a hostile government as enough to strip someone\u2019s rights. What about a mother being abused by her husband? She\u2019s got postpartum depression, maybe, and her husband red flags her, kills her because she can\u2019t defend herself. \n\nThere\u2019s also just the baseline issue of expanding the police force to actually be able to enforce the laws on the books already, plus the investigations and paperwork for universal background checks, red flag laws, etc. To pass all this and have it be effective means a massively increased police force and ultimately, likely a lot more people in jail at least in the short term.",

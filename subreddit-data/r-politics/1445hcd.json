Because overall, without the added funding, the reach of any candidate suffers. So while there are voters who will drink swamp water off the radioactive roads in Florida, financial backers who pull out will have a greater effect on DeSantis on a national level. The campaign road seems short on the calendar but in the final months of even the primaries extra cash to spend can be pivotal when it comes to loading up on advertising, and rallies etc.\n\nWhich brings me to my argument there should be limits to campaign fundraising. The obscene amounts of money these politicians raise do nothing for society as a whole, and that angers me.",

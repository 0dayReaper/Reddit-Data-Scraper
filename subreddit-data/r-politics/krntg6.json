It wasn\u2019t just Trump\u2019s insanity, or Mitch and the 2000 checks, or the insanity of the GOP... it was the casual conservative member allowing themselves to be seduced by false prophets. It was the collective disgust of everyone around these conservatives that has propelled the success of Stacey Abrams and the New Democratic Party. \n\nSo, thanks for your help on this guys!",

From what I understand of it, the race was decided by about 100 votes.  There are 300 some votes being challenged that didn't have the date on the outside envelope which they supposedly are supposed to have.  It was already decided by the PA Supreme Court that they are valid and I think it is now at the federal level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty well established that states run their elections, but if that is what the rule is and they didn't, I'm curious to see what they rule.  Also, you would think they could have asked for an expedited hearing so the apparent winner wouldn't be withheld from being sworn in.  Or, I'd imagine there'd be some provision that if the court rules against him and he loses the election, they could just remove him anyways, so they should just go ahead and seat him.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crazier part was that the senate voted to remove the dem Lt. Gov from presiding over the session.  I don't know how these kind of things work, but that seems weird.  Like if 50 republicans and Joe Manchin randomly voted to remove Kamala Harris at some point from overseeing the Senate.  Things are wild right now",

If what you're saying is true, the polls would have been favorable for dems from the beginning. After watching polls and tracking political elections for a few years it's become incredibly clear to me that the voting population has a narrow focus and very short memory, so something like denied $2,000 checks at the right time is enough to swing an election.\n\nPolls: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/?cid=rrpromo",

He's probably one of the most successful Senate Majority Leaders of all time. \n\nHim not willing to bring the $2k feels like a ploy to protect Republican Senators who would vote it down and expose them to bigger losses in 2022. I also think he thought he would hold GA, or was okay with the risk, knowing that midterms usually swing against the sitting party. As successful a Majority Leader he is, he's an even better minority opposition leader. \n\nEdit: It's incredibly likely that the stimulus would've passed the Senate, but I think part of Mitch's deal to be Senate Majority Leader is to only bring legislation to the floor of the Senate that has consensus among the GOP. Since they were split on it, he wasn't going to bring it to the floor to pass with Democrat help.",

            "comment": "The Democrats should just go hog fucking wild. Offer Manchin something super cozy in exchange for his seat, I don't care. They have two years to offer an extremely stark contrast against Trump's presidency. If they get a lot of meaningful change done, the vacuum left in Trump's absence might actually persuade some of his supporters to realize \"oh wow, I really was conned, my life really *is* significantly better under Democratic leadership.\" I can only think that's the case because Trump had a ton of support from non-voters who aren't necessarily Republicans. So they won't default to automatically voting for Republican in 2022 or 2024.\n\nThe things that the Democrats offer have to really be meaningful for the working class, though. If poor Mississippians finally feel like their lives are improving, they can be won over. If the focus is only on things that appeal mainly to big-city voters, the Republicans will win big again. It's not that I don't support things like trans protections, for example, and I think meaningful positive change is needed there, but I hope that at some point, there's a realization that so many of Trump's voters weren't conservative or Republican, they were desperate and struggling lower-class workers who have felt abandoned. Some of them have never met a trans person in their life. That's not to dismiss the fight for trans rights by any means, but those Trump voters *can* be won over, despite what it may seem, by having someone fight for their economic interests and give them a leg up. Now is the time to just fucking go for it and try to win back some of the voters that Trump really let down.",

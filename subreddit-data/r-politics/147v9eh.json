The other side of dragging it out is it delays giving Biden a win economically - which is a win politically as most folks vote by how they\u2019re doing and how they think they\u2019ll do financially.\n\nThe thing is, payments have stopped. Interest has stopped too, but mostly payments have stopped. When payments start again, that\u2019ll be less money for consumer spending which is really the barometer of economic health these days if we\u2019re being honest (not debt, not income, not savings, or property values)\u2026\n\nIt will take a few months but when the rust starts forming on the consumer market machine, stocks will plummet and the recession which has poked its little gopher head out the last 11 months will finally be acknowledged by Hot Dog vendors and happy hours\n\nStocks drop, gas gets a little cheaper, lots more people laid off, some foreclosures on houses where rent got redonkulous with 6% interest rates on mortgages and Quantitive Easing is back on the menu.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the future that conservatives could either inherit OR blame on Biden depending on how the elections play out. \n\nNow, on the other end. If they wipe the debt. There isn\u2019t even major commercial banking companies going under.  Maybe the State of Missouri (folks behind MOHELA) gets a bailout check and they shuffle half of them over to Frannie or Freddie. So the focus economically will be on those who\u2019s debt is now forgiven.\n\nWell, it\u2019s very similar to the last 11 months, but not really.  It\u2019s not like ALL student loans are being forgiven.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cwe\u2019re gonna add Kevin Durant to the Warriors\u201d cap boom situation. We aren\u2019t gonna super charge the economy should this actually go through.\n\nIt\u2019s a political win though, and with no more shocks to the system, the \u201csoft landing\u201d probably finishes and Biden can not only coast in his second term, he can sell the American public on handing the reigns of a stable economy with a shrinking defect, rising wages, to a nation that\u2019s not had 12 years of Democratic control since FDR and Truman.\n\nI think Newsom makes his move then and America finally makes its first actual step Left for a long ass time. In 2028 I don\u2019t know if that means trying to build bullet trains, a public healthcare option, or actually taking on guns.",

If you live in a community property state then a spouse may be on the hook for certain marital debts. If states have necessaries statutes then there may be certain debts that could potentially be passed on. \n\nAlways best to consult a lawyer before doing anything.

I know people who are closer to paying theirs off need the forgiveness,  but for someone like me who's over 150k in debt, the freeze on interest accruing would've made a way bigger difference for me. If I have to pay interest on my Stafford loans I might be able to get them forgiven in another ten years through PSLF, but otherwise it will take me decades to pay it off, and who knows if I'll ever retire.",

This is how it was in the Soviet Union. I prefer the American system, because it lets you go to college later in life and even if you weren't the best at high school because some people mature later. I just think people should make better decisions when picking colleges, like attending in-state public colleges. Many states already have good scholarship programs that cover your whole tuition if you were a high achiever. NY even covers all New Yorkers tuition if they make under a certain amount and are willing to work in the state for however many years you received the scholarship.",

You have dick heads who will argue we shouldn\u2019t get help, that\u2019s cool. Now when you have millions of people leave jobs to find better employment and pay for these ever ballooning bills I don\u2019t want those same morons to ask WhY DoEs NoBOdY WaNTs To WoRk AnYMore. People are like \u201cthink of the added debt over the next decade\u201d. My guys it\u2019s 400 billion over 10 years! Whereas we\u2019ve had presidents add TRILLIONS of debt in 4 years! Seriously anyone that hides behind the whole \u201cbut the national debt\u201d clearly needs to get their heads out their asses. \n\nI cannot blame those that will become the WAVE of defaults and bankruptcies that will be done within the 6-12 months after restarting. My debts are mixed private and public, my private was never frozen during covid so for 3 years I was paying the bill. Now that public is coming online I\u2019ll most likely need a part time on top of my 9-5. I would spend a little here and there you know maybe new shoes for running or everyday wear, or going to the movies with my friends or eating out at a restaurant. Nowadays when the loan comes back online I\u2019m probably doing little to none of that going forward. I\u2019ve also, ended my streaming apps, to plug any \u201choles\u201d in my pay. I\u2019m considering to even stop having health insurance to save hundreds per month that way, just for it to then go to my loans. \n\nFuck this dark timeline we live in. I really hope the next generation learns from us and cripple the college for profit industry. Run them into the ground and force many of their doors to shutter. Let\u2019s do the reverse this coming generation do trades or join the service and get your 4 years then bounce. This is beyond fucking moronic and the fact that people don\u2019t care about essentially 50 million people getting ready to be struggling more than they already are I don\u2019t want to hear shit, when they complain why American credit cards go up or why more and more bills are being missed or why there\u2019s a slow growing homeless population. There was plenty of time to help, you\u2019ve dragged your heels and seeing how backwards the court is you\u2019ll probably win your decision, all because \u201cyou had to suffer and so should we\u201d. Fuck off to anyone that gets pleasure in seeing their fellow peers enter more struggles all because some arbitrary number of 1s and 0s scare them.",

The SC is going to strike down forgiveness, so Biden will provide no relief and stupidly make himself the president that restarted payments. \n\nIf Trump declared a national emergency to get money for his wall, Biden could do the same over inflation and no increase in wages. The SC could strike it down after half a year, and he could try something else to keep stalling. During the campaign, this could be an issue that would get students to vote for reps and senators to codify forgiveness and meaningful reform. Make the SC the bad guys. Don't let them make you the impotent fool. You want to convince young people to keep voting blue as they grow older, not disillusion them. This is an important voting block for the future.\n\nThat's a better strategy than doing fuck all and making students not want to vote and sit out as a protest. We need them.",

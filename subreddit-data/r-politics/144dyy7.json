They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural,and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them,because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d\n\n\\--Pastor Dave Barnhart",

The narrative is being pushed that terrorists caused them to scale back the displays. they\u2019re not giving in to terrorists, but rather their consumer base who simply said, \u201cno. this isn\u2019t for me\u201d. I think it would be worse in the eyes of the left if target leadership said that the reason they are pulling pride displays is because of the massive consumer boycott. It looks far better to the left if they had to pull the displays because they were concerned for their employee safety due to terroristic threats. Why do you guys think all of these companies scaled back their twitter logos to not be pride inclusive this month? You see pride flags every other year before\u2026. Why are companies not doing the simple act of having pride logos for the month of June? They did it for the last 7 years consistently. Why not now?",

This sounds slightly morbid but I don\u2019t think we will see any significant swing towards more progressive ideals until the baby boomer generation of politicians either retires, or passes away. They are holding on to their seats for as long as possible, and because they had so many more opportunities when they were younger than we do now, they see the world in a different light. There are exceptions to that, of course, but besides Bernie, even the democratic politicians that I do highly approve of seem to be detached from the reality that we live in as average citizens. \n\nBiden has really given me hope, as many of the EOs he\u2019s issued are quite progressive in nature, but I think it\u2019s more important and more reflective of the populace to see those changes come from Congress.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve thought more about what I\u2019ve said here, and I\u2019ve changed m my tune a bit. As long as someone isn\u2019t showing signs of cognitive decline, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to completely rule out baby boomer politicians. Obviously someone like Feinstein is an example of someone absolutely needing to step down. But it wasn\u2019t fair of me to completely be against a certain demographic holding office just because of their age. While young blood is needed and welcomed, we still need our established politicians like Sanders, Pelosi, and Biden to guide these younger politicians into leadership roles. I still have mixed views on the matter, but I did want to add this to my original outlook.",

And presumably these officers had families who could help them through depression or PTSD. They had access to medical care. They could've taken a leave of absence. No one in the nation -- in the world -- blamed any officers who weren't clearly treasonous for what happened.\n\nIt just seems very, very odd to me. In the past few years alone, there have been riots, mass murders, innocent people killed by cops... and none of the cops involved, as far as I know, have killed themselves. Not even after children were killed. The officials who guarded the cages of children didn't kill themselves. Police who witnessed the murder of George Floyd didn't kill themselves.\n\nThis is highly unusual. I hope the families speak out, if only to prevent it from happening again.",

I strongly believe that if the mob had been black many more would've been killed or at least immediately arrested. I think it's not perceiving that whites are dangerous -- it's basic racism -- that contributed to the problem.\n\nBut this was an organized plot, led by Trump and other politicians and officials on his side. In addition, there were organized sub-factions within the mob. The police on the ground could do very little.\n\nIt just strikes me as extraordinary that 2 officers killed themselves in the wake of something that was so clearly not their fault. Resigning, taking a leave of absence, experiencing depression, seeking therapy -- all those things I could understand. But so quickly turning to suicide is almost incomprehensible to me. Not just one officer, but two. And no congresspeople were hurt, so it isn't like they felt guilt that they had caused injuries or deaths of civilians.\n\nObviously, the explanation that they felt they had failed makes sense but don't you find this odd?",

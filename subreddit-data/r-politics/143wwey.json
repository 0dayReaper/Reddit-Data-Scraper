That's why I was confused with your stance: Lying down with dogs isn't gonna get you the results you want.\n\n&gt;But that won't happen will it, after all the Democrats already had their chance with their big \"Jan. 6th commission\" which didn't investigate much other than to publicize that Trump is a bad guy.\n\nI mean, Congress did their part with all the info and data they gathered, reported, and turned over. But I think you seem to be of the impression that Congress has any actual power to press charges or arrest people; all they can do is refer their reports to respective law enforcement.\n\nThere's a lot of criticism to be had about the FBI taking its sweet time bringing down justice on people higher in the food chain of Jan. 6th, but what you're advocating for feels either misguided, disingenuous, or simply confused...",

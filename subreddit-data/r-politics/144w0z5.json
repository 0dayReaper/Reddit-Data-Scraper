Toward the end of it, one of the guests who previously left, came back looking for her purse.  \n\nWhile searching, you could hear her whispering to her husband loud enough for everyone else to hear that she can't believe one of her \"friends\" would steal her purse.

She never directly accused anybody.  She was just generally pissy to everyone.  \n\nI learned later that she found her purse in the glove compartment of the golf cart.  She forgot that she put it there.  She did not come back to the party and apologize to anybody.",

And the main purpose of the bill is to deter people from coming and to tighten the enforcement in the future.\" \n\n&gt;[At a different event he said:] \"This bill is 100 percent supposed to scare you,\" Roth said. \"I'm a farmer and the farmers are mad as hell. We are losing employees that are already starting to move to Georgia and other states. It's urgent that you talk to all your other people and convince them that you have resources, state representatives, other people that can explain the bill to you.\"\n\nWords fail me.

I think certain industries (construction, yard work, agriculture) have an outsized dependency on illegal immigrant labour. More specifically in the southern states, I would imagine. If you waved a wand and stopped it, prices would go up for those goods / services, and there would be a knock-on effect into other goods / services / industries. it would be good for American workers, I agree. When I dig in and look at the estimates of illegal workers in the US, compared to the working population, that\u2019s what makes me think the impact would be overall small\n\nThose estimates are most likely not very accurate, and the people doing the estimating are politically motivated, so sure - my thesis could be based on flawed assumptions\n\nNAFTA, which I think in many ways is designed to help combat illegal immigration, has (IMO) a much larger contribution - like 50x or 100x\n\nBut your point is taken - to discard illegal immigration entirely is disingenuous",

Torkington, for example, the government successfully argued that the case should be reassigned. The 11th Circuit ruled that the offending judge \u201chas demonstrated great difficulty in putting aside his prior conclusions about the merits of this prosecution and that reassignment is necessary to preserve the appearance of impartiality.\u201d\n\n&gt;United States v. Martin. As it happens, it was handled by MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance when she was a federal prosecutor in Alabama, which is also covered by the 11th Circuit. The judge in Martin was reversed multiple times on the issue of the defendant\u2019s sentence. The appeals court cited that repeat issue in the criminal case as well as the judge\u2019s imposition of skewed sentences in other cases.\n\n&gt;United States v. Gupta, referring to Martin and Torkington, respectively: \u201cReassignment is necessary when a district judge adheres to erroneous views after multiple remands\u201d or when a judge questions the wisdom of the law they have to apply and challenges the government\u2019s decision to prosecute a particular defendant.\n\nNot solutions, still wary, but is not unheard of... especially with Cannons already shaky history with Trump relates rulings.",

Quotes from possible witnesses, in this indictment, but for things that happened at Bedminster. \n\nAnd still documents that have not been recovered.\n\nPeople keep saying Jack Smith also has DC as the venue for Jan 6th crimes, which he also is investigating. \n\nIt seems to reason the Special Counsel's Team is not done with Bedminster and if further evidence of obstruction and concealment comes out during the 11th circuit Florida, that could be how they move from Florida to New Jersey. I can only imagine there are reasons of establishing statements and defense in Florida, which will then contradict anything Trump can say in defense of whatever is at or went to New Jersey.",

The one judge who has already proven herself a sycophant somehow ends up with the biggest case in history on her desk? How is she in anyway qualified for this? Or have the clearance?\n\nWe will jump through all the hoops and go through the motions of \"having a trial\" when we all know she is just going to throw the case in his favor one way or another. That mock trial is supposed to be our justice apparently, not the ACTUAL consequences. It is supposed to be enough to placate the public. There will be zero consequences.\n\nMark my words: this is how Trump will slip through the cracks and escape justice once again. He won't be able to be tried again with a fair judge, as that would be double jeopardy. He won't have any consequences, and all our faithful and very honest leaders will claim that we had a real trial, and this was the results and we'll just have to live with it I guess, shucks. Now they will focus on \\[insert newest crisis\\] going forward instead. (So you should too)\n\n/tinfoil hat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore any trial starts, and whether the case is reassigned to a new judge or not, let me ask you this: For everything he has done, and all the damning evidence against him, what would you do if Trump got sentenced to like... 6 months house arrest? There could be no re-trial, there would be no more advocating for justice- that's it, end of story: 6 months at Mar-a-lago, no visitors, limited internet/social media. How would you feel if that was the ballpark we were looking at, or something pretty similar?\n\nPeople thinking he will get 10-20 years (or more) in prison are just caught up in the moment. It absolutely should be that, it should be a lot more. I wish it would be that... I promise you it won't be.",

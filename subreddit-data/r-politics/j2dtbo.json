Trump was a child on stage like he always is and his supporters just ate that shit up like it was crack. I really hope the next \"debate\" is better because at this point the issues have nothing to do with this ACTUAL \"political\" **THEATRE**.",

Biden did his fair share of stupid interjecting too, and as usual, benefits most from shutting the hell up.\n\nThe jabs felt good to hear, but that's not what we need. We need clear debate, one side clearly expressing their thoughts uninterrupted, and having the other side actually having to take the points in and form a rebuttal in a clear and concise manner. That did not happen tonight and it was embarrassing for everyone involved and everyone watching. It was an hour and a half of children bickering, while one of them threw a tantrum, and it was just... awful all around. The Moderator needs a killswitch on the mics to prevent this shit.",

So then we talked MLB stats.  I mentioned that Dodger Stadium was a polling place this year.  He told me he probably just wasn't going to vote this year.\n\nI suppose that's the best I can hope for, in this case.",

Another 31% are a PIAAC level 1 or below - approximately a 3rd to 4th grade education level. And Trump specifically tries to appeal to the least educated of Americans. \n\nSo yes, many of them are stupid. Many have backwards views, and their actions and words are condemnable. But we also have to recognize the root of this problem: an education system that historically and presently fails a majority of Americans. It fails to give them the literacy to competently understand the issues, so they follow the one person who speaks at their level. \n\nTrump didn't happen in a vaccum, and we will continue to have more like him unless we seriously commit to reforming education.",

Ok this is really fucking spooky.\n\nWhen I first got into politics a decade or so ago, the first topic I really gravitated towards was foreign policy. The Iraq war (and later Libya and Syria) really bothered me because of all the civilian deaths and chaos they caused in the Middle East. I later came to find out one of my coworkers was an Iraqi refugee, so I asked him about it. He described the first nights of the war, and what happened when the government collapsed. It was rioting and looting on a scale the US has never seen. He described hiding out in a family friend's barn for the first night, and how both his parents cars were stolen and his house robbed, while the sounds of explosions rang off in the distance (tomahawk missiles). Religous extremist groups tore down the country within days. Make no mistake about it, this is how the US takes control of countries. It's called \"destabilization\" for a reason. \n\nI felt so much empathy for my refugee coworker and remember thinking \"How would Americans feel if China or Russia came over here, armed the KKK to the teeth, collapsed our government, then told them to go take over?\" Obviously, the KKK and other white supremacists are already armed to the teeth ('murica), but what if current events are all part of Russia's plan? What if they're taking a page from our own foreign policy handbook and using the election conspiracies to light the fuse? This seems like a very real possibility the more I think about it.",

But super left people all want climate to be addressed more than \"oh we'll rake some leaves\" and lower costs on new vehicles with all their \"computers\". Biden's plan is a million times better than Trump's and any left leaning person who understands the basics of climate change (after hearing Trump's response, I don't think he does), they will side with Biden.\n\nTrump thinks left voters are all as gullible and emotionally-driven as his supporters because the Republican party has to be in lock step with their stances because it's the only thing keeping them together.",

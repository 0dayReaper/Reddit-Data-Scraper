In order to win they need to attack Trump, which is pretty easy to do, but they won\u2019t, even when they have all the ammo in the world, because they need/want his base. So they mill around aimlessly throwing the occasional mild jab and end up looking weak and weird and gormless as they avoid going for the throat. It leaves them with nothing to talk about but *policy* and Republicans just have nothing there. So they shoot themselves in the thumbs over and over until Trump wins because he doesn\u2019t care and attacks them at will.",

Ultimately, I don't think his run is necessarily about capturing support/momentum to outright beat Trump.\n\nIt seems quite evident that Pence, DeSantis, and Christie have essentially signed up to take on Trump as a team.   The idea being that they all do what they can individually to whittle away at Trump's support and then line up behind a clear favorite at the right time in hopes to take him down.\n\nPence and Christie have enough name recognition to effectively freeze the field.  It's going to be damn near impossible for any \"dark horse\" to find a solid 3rd place finish in any of the early states with the former president, his former VP, and two of the most well-known and recognizable figures in the GOP all on the ballot.\n\nPoint being, this is how you keep the field small and build *pointed* contrast between Trump and each of the other candidates individually rather than letting him muddy the waters against a huge field that can easily be blanketly dismissed as \"not Trump\".",

It's certainly the most glaring example of how Trump is perceived by most of the GOP power-brokers.\n\nIt may not mean much to primary voters right this second, but is a crystal clear message to donors and activists across the country, which can significantly shape perception.\n\nAdditionally, it keeps J6 squarely in the spotlight of the campaign, given the whole, ya know \"Hang Mike Pence\" thing.\n\nIt also places Trump's blatant hypocrisy front and center.  No matter how much he tries to spin it, the guy who he chose to be his VP is running against him and there's no \"alternative fact\" that can muddy the water of that one simple truth.  It's kind of like an American version of a vote of no-confidence.\n\nHell, even the softball narrative that \"he can only serve one more term and we need an 8-year strategy\" is a fundamental move to break the grip Trump has on the GOP.",

While he didn't *want* Trump in 2016, he didn't go full HAM against him.  Now, it's both a political necessity *and* personal.\n\nTo your point about the field... there hasn't been a major party primary with this kind of name recognition between the top candidates... maybe ever?  1912, I guess?  So, it's going to be highly unlikely that many people will be willing to take on the former president, his VP, and the most well-known GOP governor.  It would be almost impossible to eat in to the support needed to make waves in the early primary states, and we're just 7 months away from voting.",

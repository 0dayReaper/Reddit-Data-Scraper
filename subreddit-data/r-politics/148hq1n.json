Antipsychotics block dopamine in the Mesolimbic pathway. Mushrooms act as an exogenous analog to seratonin, not dopamine and act on a different part of the brain. Psilocybin binds seratonin 2a receptors in the medial frontal cortex. The next day you feel good because you excited neuronal pathways by putting more gas into the system, pathways that had not been turned on in a while will remain on after things settle and the substance leaves your system. It\u2019s an entropy thing and has to do with activating formerly inactive pathways, unlike antipsychotics which block pathways. While activating vs blocking pathways seems opposite, they work on different neurotransmitters in different parts of the brain. \n\nYou compared an apple to a steak.",

CB1 and CB2 receptors have nothing to do with ADHD and those are the receptors that interact with THC, CBD, and other phytocannabinoids. The endocannabinoid system is primarily involved with\n\n&gt;  Sleep, temperature control, pain control, inflammatory and immune responses, and eating \n\n- *Harvard.edu*\n\nThis is why smoking weed makes you hungry and sleepy. Because those are functions controlled by your endocannabinoid system.  \n\n\nOverstimulation of the endocannabinoid system can actually disrupt memory and focus. These would actually worsen symptoms of ADHD rather than treat it.\n\n\n&gt; Memory impairment from marijuana use occurs because THC alters how the hippocampus, a brain area responsible for memory formation, processes information. Most of the evidence supporting this assertion comes from animal studies.\n\n- *nih.gov*\n\n\nStimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin increase dopamine in the reward/motivation centers of the brain making it easier for synapses related to executive functioning to occur. The inability to initiate these synapses without medication is more or less the basis for ADHD to begin with.\n\n\n&gt; Although ADHD is a multifactorial disorder, disrupted dopamine (DA) neurotransmission plays an important role in its pathophysiology. In addition, polymorphisms in the dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) are associated with the disorder (Misener et al. 2004). MPH and d-AMP both enhance DA signaling in the brain. MPH increases DA by blocking dopamine transporters (DATs) and AMP by releasing DA from the nerve terminal using the DAT as carrier (Kuczenski and Segal 1997).\n\n- *ncbi.gov*\n\n\nSo, yes, amphetamines would do a significantly better job at treating ADHD than weed. Your doctor is right and weed is doing nothing for your ADHD other than placebo. Amphetamines interact with D1 receptors associated with ADHD and no active chemical in cannabis even works within that *system*.\n\n\n\n\nI fucking love weed too, but let's not kid ourselves. The known medical applications of weed are pain, inflammation, appetite, and sleep. The rest is hearsay/bullshit.",

While I wouldn't throw the first punch, or hit girls or people smaller than me, (with some failure there) I would often seek the most violent reaction first. \"They hit me first.\" being the justification for kicking someone down a flight of stairs, or taking the bat they swung at me and breaking their arm, or breaking every finger on someone's hand... it was the 80s... adults didn't help you when you asked for help, they told you to deal with it yourself, and then punished you for it. So I have the guilt of all that shit on me...   \n\n\n  \nSee... I can apply \"They didn't know any better\" readily. But I cant apply \"I didn't know any better\". On my last trip I kinda belittled myself for 6 hours. Showing myself all the times I had learned different lessons, and remembering that I actively chose to be as vicious as I could be in order to get a reputation that said leave me alone. Every instance right before doing something awful part of me said no... and I decide to ignore that.  \n\n\nI know this is not true for all... but I consider mushrooms walking into the tree of insight... You take in what you carry. But its more than that... The effects are long term... and they make you empathize more with others.",

They can make you stable and steady*.\n\nTherapy, especially evidence-based and carried out with fidelity CAN provide a lot of healing, but can only help you go so far. (I\u2019ve been in therapy off and on\u2014mostly on\u2014for 35 years.)\n\nFor me, psilocybin is *true* healing. The insights you have feel like the actual truth. It makes you focused only on the here and now. Any negative thoughts just flowed over me and didn\u2019t bother me at all. I was actually able to have a LOT more objectivity than I\u2019ve ever had. Just being in the moment is easier said than done, but with mushrooms, it\u2019s absurdly easy. And so nice! People who are using it as therapy don\u2019t just sit around tripping balls.\n\n*SSRIs work with the same chemical processes psilocybin does. So if you\u2019re on an SSRI, it takes a higher dose of mushrooms for it to work. I\u2019ve made the decision, with my psychiatrist, to VERY slowly taper down on my SSRI to half the dose I was taking (that\u2019ll take another three weeks or so\u2014been doing it three weeks already).",

When you snort a line of coke, it floods your brain with feel-good chemicals and when the high wears off, you want more. Hallucinogens are a lot more of a mixed bag, trips have ups and downs and can be pretty exhausting.

Every town is classic New England with a Main Street, a beach, or a farm with ice cream if it\u2019s inland. Very suburbia if you\u2019re not in Providence. Roads are absolutely terrible and the salt during the winter is killer on cars. Taxes are high. Public Education isn\u2019t as good as it should be, it lacks compared to the rest of the region. Lots of pharmaceutical and insurance companies here, plus CVS so there\u2019s plenty of jobs in those areas. \n\nLove the summer and fall, spring is fine, and winter isn\u2019t as bad as other New England states. A lot more diverse than it used to be. My town was 97% white when I was growing up, but now there\u2019s large Colombian and Nigerian populations throughout the state. It\u2019s very Catholic because of the Italians, Portuguese, and Irish. Super liberal, even my town which normally elects a couple of republicans to local offices went all blue last election. \n\nThe beach for me is the biggest draw. I can\u2019t imagine not living near the ocean. Sailing and fishing is big, the seafood is great, and the Italian restaurants on federal hill are top tier. \n\nPeople from CT and MA try to shit on RI cause it looks like we\u2019re all townies but they\u2019re basically all the same outside the cities.",

From that experience I realized I didn\u2019t have much going for me and life has been an upward trajectory since.  It was probably the only trip I\u2019ve had where I closed my eyes and meditated while peaking but I certainly didn\u2019t go into for medicinal reasons (I didn\u2019t think it would do anything).  To be fair I didn\u2019t immediately stop using that day it was probably 3 months later but that was 15 years ago and I reflect on that experience often.",

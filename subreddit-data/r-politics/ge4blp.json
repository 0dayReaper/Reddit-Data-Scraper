They got dealt a 2-7 off suit but the chips are already down and what else are they going to do? He\u2019s their guy so whatever he does has to be right. They can\u2019t fold because that\u2019s basically the end of their tournament life. If they nut up and admit that trump makes *any* mistakes then they\u2019ve lost everything because it\u2019s an admission that their entire ideology is a lie and their morality is corrupted.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take for them to hit rock bottom and admit trump was a colossal mistake. He will definitely not be the president on that day and he probably won\u2019t even be alive. But the simplest prediction is that these people will silently go to their graves knowing he was the worst president in our nation\u2019s history yet they will act the whole way through like he fought for the every man against the evils of big government when he did the exact opposite of both of those things.",

They told every generation of black folks to either fuck off or wait. And I\u2019ve been waiting for white Americans to show me that they at least care or think of us as Americans. They don\u2019t! We are dying and they are  begging to put more of our lives at risk. \n\nIf we look at trumps tweets around liberating different states and their role in leading to the right pushing to reopen, we see that these dates coincide with the release of information that people of color are disproportionately affected. They hate us. At the very least they\u2019re ambivalent. So, I have to leave. Being black in America is like being stateless. America doesn\u2019t respect the rights of blacks like they do whites. Capitalism exacerbated negative outcomes. No one else in the world wants black folks and the world believes the same American propaganda that white folks put out about us. Blacks get excluded from programs, the little property we do own is devalued, and typically we bear the brunt of trauma when bad things happen in this country. We\u2019ve been used in medical research against our will, we weren\u2019t allowed participation in the homestead act and the housing act, we didn\u2019t get the GI bill. Mass incarceration and redlining and gerrymandering strip us out our rights. Then my own country uses propaganda to scare white folks that don\u2019t even know any black folks. I\u2019m still trying to find a country that I can contribute to and feel like a complete citizen.",

The House and Senate are supposed to jealously guard every ounce of independence that they have from the executive branch, since that's what gives them power; and the judiciary is supposed to jealously guard every ounce of independence that they have from both other branches, since that's what gives them power.\n\nWhat the founders simply did not foresee, and could not have foreseen, was the current state of affairs in which Congress, the White House, and the judiciary are all simply treated as three departments of the same partisan corporation - means to an end rather than ends unto themselves.  None of this would be happening if Congress actually wanted to have as much power vested in themselves as possible and actually demanded that an executive branch that overstepped its boundaries be punished.  The way in which both Congress and the SCOTUS have willingly acquiesced to their own irrelevance in the face of the growing singular power vested in the executive branch is ultimately what's broken everything in America.",

Dr. Bright says BARDA estimated the US would need between 650 - 850 million needles &amp; syringes, but currently only had 15 million (~2%) on hand. Worse, he says it will probably take close to 2 YEARS to get the required amount produced.*\n\nAnd, yet, we haven\u2019t begun to address that aspect. A lot of good it will do to have a vaccine if we don\u2019t have the syringes and needles to administer it.\n\n**Source:** [Dr. Bright\u2019s Complaint](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/vaccine-expert-files-whistleblower-complaint-claims-trump-admin-illegally-retaliated-against-him/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)\n\n**Screenshot:** https://imgur.com/a/c9LCX1S",

I wanted Bernie over Biden. I wanted several candidates more than Biden. Nonetheless:\n\n2020 is SO much bigger than Biden\n\nA 2020 Trump Presidency would mean:\n\nA conservative judiciary the rest of your life. A likely 7-2 SCOTUS, and another massive chunk of lifetime federal judge appointments.\n\nThis means unfavorable rulings for: climate change, abortion, gerrymandering, executive power, executive oversight, Congressional authority, civil rights, immigration issues (children in cages), and so, so much more. You can basically say goodbye to this for decades to come with a Trump Presidency. Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency.\n\nIt would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America's King.\n\nIt would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.\n\nThe continued isolation of America on the world stage. Every country on the planet besides NK, Saudi Arabia, and Russia does. not. trust. us. anymore. We are a mockery on the world stage in everything we do. The most corrupt cabinet in history. William Barr, Betsy DeVos, Mnuchin, Wheeler, Pence. It's like a super team of unqualified, horrendous people with enormous conflicts of interest. Every position is basically hired to deconstruct the agency they work for. The intelligence community is being flat-out purged for loyalists. A continuing WAR against climate change efforts and science. Undoubtedly the biggest issue humanity, including our children, grandchildren, and beyond will face.\n\nNo matter what your criticisms of Biden are,\n\nLet's remember who Trump is:\n\n-Trump defrauded the government of $400 million dollars.\n\n-Trump ran a fraudulent charity (one that supported veterans and children with cancer) and university.\n\n-Trump cheated on his third wife with a porn star and illegally paid her to keep quiet before an election.\n\n-Trump committed at least 5 felony instances of Obstruction of Justice., including trying to get Mueller (the man investigating him) fired... twice.\n\n-Trump was impeached for Obstruction of Congress and Abuse of Power.\n\n-Trump killed a top general of a hostile nation that posed no imminent threat.\n\n-Trump has over twenty sexual misconduct/assault allegations.\n\n-Trump tried to lie about a hurricane by extending a forecast with a fucking sharpie on a map because he couldn't admit he made a mistake on twitter.\n\n-Trump doesn't believe in climate change.\n\n-Trump thinks windmills cause cancer and raking prevents forest fires\n\n.-Trump is a stable genius - The \"nuclear\" quote - Another classic\n\n-Trump's only \"political experience\" prior to becoming President was fueling a racist conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya.\n\n-Trump told a group of minority Congresswomen (3 of which born in America) to \"go back\" to the countries they came from.\n\n-Trump got on the stage at Helsinki to tell the world he trusts Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies.\n\n-Trump is purging the intelligence community and replacing the positions with unqualified sycophants.\n\n-Trump is exploiting a public health crisis for personal gain, and using the cover to remove oversight.\n\nAt the end of the day, we have a choice to make in November as reasonable adults and Americans.",

Trump don't take shit from anyone &amp; that's just like me. \n\nWell I do take unemployment, but that's just until Trump repairs the damage done by Obama. Oh, I'm a farmer in Iowa so I've also taken subsidies from the govt the past couple of years. This is to make up the lost profit from our tariff war with China. And we're winning! But my farm is going to foreclose in 6 months if I don't start making more money. \n\nBut I believe when Trump isn't golfing or staying on Twitter in the middle of an Adderall binge, he's going to protect us all. And by all I mean, white, high school graduate, racist, homophobic, Christian, kill all the libs, dipshits who protest science, medical professionals, and cops, people.",

We're one sane election away from joining the 21st century, and one insane, populist, cristo-nationalist election away from authoritarianism/fascism. \n\nIt's kind of like the debt crisis, I don't know why anyone would want to deal with the US unless they have to anymore. Any deal that one administration negotiates an insane administration can undo, and in fact go in the opposite direction on.\n\nThe US right now is basically the nation-state manifestation of a paranoid schizophrenic with multiple personality disorder. You can rationalize, deal and live with one personality, but the other one might try to knife you when you aren't looking and laugh about it.",

Bush estranged our allies with the Iraq War, when Obama said \"America is back, we'll never do that again\" our allies fell over themselves applauding and even gave Obama a Nobel Peace Prize (for not being Bush).\n\nAfter Trump, when Biden said \"America is back, we're never doing that again\" the credibility is just not there. We ***might*** do that again. Our allies cannot count on us to never \"go Trump.\" I think there would be a lot more disunity in the West right now if it weren't for the Russian invasion. That forced Europe back into the US-led paradigm. You can even see that some european leaders like Macron don't want it very much but they have no choice at present.",

If they don't do something soon, the idiots actually will take over. It can get so much worse. RCV or approval voting would be a way to short circuit many crazies.

It's to fan the flames of Trump's Magic that has worked so well for him with votes - make these (hopefully few) jurors *resonate* with the *supposed* injustice Trump is enduring.\n\nTrouble is... well... although \"Trump Lawyer\" can make snide comments throughout the trial, they really only get opening and closing statements here.\n\nThe strategy is relatively clear and works well enough in social media and TV/radio filter bubbles.\n\nBut... it's going to get **overwhelmed** during the meticulous never ending clear portrayal of how specific the laws are, how blatantly Trump violated them and how exceedingly and explicitly clear it is that Trump knew what he was doing and absolutely expected impartial treatment (i.e. to be above the law... the very law he signed).",

[It's not a coincidence that Jared Kushner got $2 billion USD from Saudi Arabia after Trump left the Whitehouse](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-04-11/how-did-jared-kushner-get-2-billion-from-the-saudis#xj4y7vzkg).\n\nI like how Trump supporters ignore how corrupt Trump and his family are though, especially when the son in law of the president was also working in the Whitehouse.  Trump is the most corrupt president in US history, but Trump supporters simply ignore his corruption. SMH.",

(2) he ensures Kushner is a paid accomplice, meaning he is A LOT less likely to sing to the feds.\n\nAlso, there is no deal that gets made without other people and intermediaries- especially when it comes to Trump. He couldn\u2019t be the initial receiver of those funds because of the emoluments clause, and it would arouse too much suspicion even if he received them directly after his term ended.",

                    "comment": "At this point it doesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t care that he is the most corrupt politician (not only the most corrupt president) in American history, they don\u2019t have any sound arguments or platform to defend him outside of fear and rage and rejecting facts, and their rulers are actively rejecting democracy to their supporters\u2019 delight. \n\nThe republican powers that be know they are doomed and outnumbered, this is the last gasp of a dying party, which makes them desperate and dangerous. Since admitting mistakes and aligning their platform with their constituents is viewed as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d, they are forced to double down on defending corruption. Not to mention most of republican leadership is so obviously compromised (Russia still hasn\u2019t released details from their RNC hack, supported many chaos agents and dark money being exposed, and since the republicans all seem to parrot Russian talking propaganda incessantly when it makes ZERO sense, in addition to meadows flipping potentially implicating congress members/senators), they shirked their duty when they chose not to impeach him twice, and now the chickens have come home to roost. \n\nHowever, his supporters don\u2019t give a shit. They simply want to have people to look down on, they need an enemy/boogeyman, that\u2019s their idea of what society is. Their enemy can\u2019t be abortion anymore, so now they go deeper and it\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t follow their cultish beliefs/fox news/oan/news max talking points. \n\nThey sincerely believe that they are the ruling class or will be if they support him enthusiastically, so any level of corruption, even fucking espionage and potentially selling state secrets/high treason isn\u2019t enough to move them off of their position, as long as they think that they are included in the ruling/privileged class that will be able to get away with it!\n\nSo no matter what happens, they will say it\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201cliberal conspiracy\u201d and disregard any evidence, and many know it is all complete bullshit. The republican leadership will fall in line (the loudest voices were part of the coup attempt) as they have skin in the game. And many MAGA citizens will support any lie from their leaders as long as it justifies their racism, fear, misogyny and homophobia, just look at the deflection and misdirection from them - Anna Paulina Luna (Ran saying she was Jewish when her family were literal Nazis) saying some witness against Joe Biden \u201cfears for his life\u201d even after their investigation admitted there were no facts or anything criminal, Jim Jordan/many congress members attempting to influence state investigations against him, calls from his allys to defund FBI and DOJ, the woman that accused Biden of sexual assault taking asylum in Russia, etc., \n\nThey don\u2019t care that their public supporters are compromised chaos agents, don\u2019t care about espionage, don\u2019t care about treason, as long as they believe they will \u201crule\u201d over lesser people, and \u201cthe right people are hurting\u201d e.g. immigrants, black people, lgbtq community, Jews, etc., they will actively support corruption and fascism because they believe they will get to BE the ones in power (fascists) and \u201ccorrect\u201d society! And the media, instead of reporting this, is like, \u201cTrump or Desantis??? Who will be the republican candidate!?!!\u201d Lol\n\nJack smith doesn\u2019t seem to be fucking around tho, meadows flipped, and it all looks like everything we have known for years is coming to a head. Fuck his supporters, fuck the media and moderates \u201cboth sidesing\u201d this shit,  fuck people defending treason, fuck the delusional cult followers, fuck the compromised Supreme Court conservatives, fuck the chaos agents in the house and fuck the federalist society, fuck citizens United, fuck legal bribery and lobbying, and if Garland doesn\u2019t make an example here with all of this egregious evidence (federalist society member), fuck him too. They are flailing because they are finished in the next 5-7 years and they know it. But so does Gen Z and Millennials. \n\nI\u2019m drunk and high, ranted too long. Don\u2019t care. Fuck em all.",

He is running for president again. He has repeatedly shown his disregard for the Constitution and his willingness to place his own personal interests above those of the country.\n\n\u2026..\n\n&gt;That is why we must frame the nature of the crimes with which the former president is being charged so carefully. We dare not numb ourselves to why they are important, numb ourselves to the anger and outrage we should be feeling or to the sense of danger that the likely defendant carries with him should the cases prove unsuccessful or, God forbid, their verdicts are subsequently nullified by an American electorate that failed to understand the scale and gravity of the crimes Trump committed repeatedly, often before our very eyes.\n\n\nArticle continues\u2026.",

In this, the aim is to claim that everything he took was personal effects/mementos and if anything sensitive or classified slipped in well oopsie, they were just boxes of things etc.\n\nThere is, I think, a real likelihood Trump ('s associates) specifically tried to hide their criminal activity through a scheme like this, attempting to mix in classified materials with more benign general records and the likes.\n\nThe additional thrust \"boxes\" over \"documents\" is that it is broadly true that taking boxes of mementos and personal effects is normal behavior and he can pin any other President with having done the same thing. Obfuscate how and why what he did was different.\n\nThis is a flimsy defense, to be sure, but the sticking point for any charges will likely be based on if they can establish intent or a specific scheme/conspiracy. \n\nIt has been rumored that conspiracy charges are in the mix, and given that Meadows and possibly others have flipped, I would assume the case will be made primarily on the strength of testimony along with the literal seized evidence.\n\nI think it is safe to say the DOJ wouldn't press charges if they weren't extremely confident of the outcome, but who knows, dumb as it all is, until we see otherwise Trump *is* effectively immune from legal recourse and as much as this is likely the end for him as a free man, wouldn't be at all surprised if he worms out of it somehow, either.",

While Friday\u2019s indictment does not address these issues, we know from media reports that the special counsel is still actively investigating them. And if that investigation uncovers unlawful misconduct then additional indictments will likely follow.",

We have 37 felony charges right now in FL, but this is likely only the first indictment in what could turn into a relentless drumbeat of charges against Trump from the special council investigation.   Sure, the current charges could potentially be enough to see him in prison (or more likely house arrest) for the rest of his life, but they haven't touched on any of the January 6th stuff or election interference, or wire fraud from his blatant fundraising grifts.  \n\nMy confident prediction is that these are only the first of many charges we're going to see rolled out, and once everything is said and done, Trump will be remembered by history as an absolute prolific criminal who also was president at some point.",

This sort of evidence is exactly what prosecutors would want to have in a case as high-profile and politically charged as this one. \n\n&gt;But it takes time and effort for investigators to collect this evidence and assemble the case necessary to secure an indictment. At the same time, the fact that Trump is a leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination is no doubt putting pressure on the special counsel and his team to move quickly and maximize the chances that any charges are resolved before the election takes place. In this context, it would arguably make sense for the special counsel to move forward with an indictment for the charges for which they have the strongest evidence first, even as they continue to investigate and build the case for additional prosecutorial steps down the line.",

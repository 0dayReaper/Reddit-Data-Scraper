Rich people and politicians who need money. There's supply and demand. Even if you ban bribery the demand is there. \n\nWe used to have 90% tax rate on the rich but that didn't stop the bribery because 10% of 200 billion is 20 billion and most elections need just a few million to make a big difference.  \n\nThe only option is to make it illegal to own so much wealth. But putting a ceiling doesn't do anything about the people who already have billions. You still haven't fixed the problem. You have to forcefully confiscate their wealth on top of the ban and ban people. The easier way would be to reshape the system so that money goes to workers instead of shareholders, CEOs, and owners.",

It creates a system where the national party effectively picks the candidates during a primary. The old guard democrats are awful in this way. They operate like a geriatric country club determined to take their power to the grave while young, progressive candidates and voters are antagonized instead of utilized. Then the general election is decided by donors and a gun to our heads (e.g., Trump).",

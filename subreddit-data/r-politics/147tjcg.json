Any disaster or tragedy is the only thing that can get these people fully erect because their nihilism/inhumanity is *total*. Even going back to the Las Vegas mass-shooting some years back, I remember talking with some asshole Republican whose best contribution about that was something along the lines of 'oh well.

That is the in group right now. White males who think like them. But when that is all that is left, there isn't an outgroup trying to oppress them any more so they have to divide that in-group into smaller groups. They do that already. Because it's white Christian males, that think like them. A Muslim who is white and thinks like them don't count. \n\nAfter they \"win\" It will be certain white Christian males that think like them. The group keeps getting smaller, till they are truly a minority of one, and as such don't exist after a bit.",

They did not prosecute Clinton because there was nothing found to be criminally negligent, and it was not worth going after her/her team for something that would boil down to politically motivated. It was obvious that Clinton wasn't doing things in a malicious light.  \n\nHer and her team *did* mishandle classified information. Someone on her team *should've* lost their access/been subjected to remedial training/lost their job. Their saving grace was that previously-mentioned lack of maliciousness and lack of evidence that any of the information had been compromised. They did *not* follow established rules and regulations. \n\nThe reason(s) Trump is cooked is because there is **overwhelming** evidence to suggest all of the above. The egregious nature of all of it is why there will be hell to pay.  \n\nShould Clinton have faced more scrutiny? Maybe. Maybe not. Her team of handlers that were moving that information around for her and overseeing the storage and processing of that information? **YES**. That said, she lost the election in no small part to the smear that came from it. Whether that's a good or bad thing, I'm not interested in the convo.",

Maybe even be elected again!\n\nThis is because he belongs to the class of \u201cthose\u201d people. The legal system does not apply to elites in this country. Trump could straight up whip out a Glock, on live TV, put it to someone\u2019s head, pull the trigger\u2026 and absolutely nothing would happen to him. He\u2019d never see a jail cell, even if he committed blatant murder on live TV in front of the entire country. \n\nIt took Epstein raping *hundreds* of young girls over a decade+ long period with the FBI having mountains of evidence to get \u201cjail\u201d. And *even then* he was allowed to leave jail during the day. He only had to show up there to sleep more or less.\n\nThere are tons of cases of rich elites blatantly murdering someone (usually killing someone while DUI), and nothing happens. Hell it became a huge international problem when a US diplomat did exactly that in the UK and killed a 19 year old kid. They came here and\u2026? You guessed it, nothing happened to them.\n\nThe justice system in this country only applies to the working/slave caste. If you\u2019re part of the elite, it\u2019s the land of the free. You can rape kids, do drugs, engage in blatant corruption, or murder people with absolutely zero consequences. The sad part is there are literal mountains of corpses that these people have left behind. Example: pharma execs caused a huge portion of the population to get addicted to opiates and now we have more than 100,000 people PER YEAR die to overdoses due to opiate addiction. That\u2019s an entire fucking city that dies every year. The pharma execs were found to be responsible. Yet, zero consequences. They killed hundreds of thousands of people. Imagine a handful of people in Canada caused the entire of city Ottawa to die to drug addiction over the period of a decade, and then nothing happens to them. \n\n&gt;\tThat tells me not only is your justice system broken, but your democracy is also lost.\n\nWe\u2019re beyond fixing at this point. Most Americans are afraid and in complete despair. Grifter politicians latch onto that fear and despair and name scapegoats (immigrants, LGBT, \u201cwoke\u201d liberals, etc.) in order to seize power.\n\nThe average American just trying to survive out here has known that for a long, long time. Been this way for decades. It\u2019s just accelerating now because we just tipped over the edge and are now collapsing.",

Over 60% of Americans support leaving trans people and gay people the fuck alone. Over half support climate legislation and fair voting laws and universal healthcare. \n\n\nThey're screaming and trashing because they are being told by their incredibly effective propaganda that inclusiveness means they will *lose* their privileges. It's all great replacement bullshit and it's capitalizing on fear. Most people don't buy that shit. \n\nBut our news is also run like sports and what even we see on news skews reality since sensationalist journalism became the norm.

One, the 'real' government, is full of blonde haired blue eyed good ol' boys who conveniently run the parts of the government they DO like (i.e. the military, DHS, ICE), and the other is the 'bad' government, ran by ~~jews~~ err, uhh, 'degenerates' and liberals, who conveniently run the parts of the government they don't like (i.e. the IRS, Social Security, the Post Office, FBI, etc.)\n\nThey legitimately think the 'real' government, who just so happens to be the gun wielding part, is champing at the bit to arrest and execute the 'bad' Government, and just need the go ahead by the US population. So in their head, they think if the stomp and cry enough in public the 'real' government will join them and coup the 'bad' one.",

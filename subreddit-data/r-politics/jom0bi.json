It\u2019s close to the White House and very convenient.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s also next door to 1627 I St. NW, which happens to house the Washington bureau of the New York Times.\n\n&gt;Sitting at the next table, according to the Times, was Kenneth Vogel, one of Washington\u2019s most skillful investigative reporters. Vogel is a former reporter for Politico, which is based in Virginia, who arrived at the Times just in time for the Russia investigation and, as it turned out, just in time for lunch.\n\n&gt;Vogel overheard the lawyers talking about White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II and Jared Kushner, president Trump\u2019s son-in-law, as well as the infamous Trump Tower meeting. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/09/18/trump-lawyers-spill-beans-after-terrible-restaurant-choice-next-to-nyt/",

This is pure shenanigans from Trump and his enablers. Trump and his enablers are proactively doing everything they can to alter the outcome DURING the goddamn election.\n\nPresident Trump had already set the future expectations for current and future voters that our democratic institutions are unreliable for this election and later elections. I do think Trump's presidency is consequential in our times. Regardless of whether he wins or loses, I guarantee that Trump's future predecessors will act on these sets of behaviors and erode our democracy further. The man who holds the highest position of office had legitimized authoritarian tendencies for future presidents.\n\nThis is unprecedented, as painfully obvious I can spell it out here.",

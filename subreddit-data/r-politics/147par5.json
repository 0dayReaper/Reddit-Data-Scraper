Then by taking out exclusive ticketing contracts with the majority of major venues, Ticketmaster had basically cornered the ticketing market in the United States by 1993. As Pearl Jam would soon prove, if you refused to work with the company or the venues they had exclusive ticketing deals with, you were basically dead in the water.\n\nIn an attempt to circumvent Ticketmaster, Pearl Jam tried to set up its own tour by utilizing outdoors spaces where Ticketmaster had no jurisdiction. They also tried to set up certain concerts as benefits since the Ticketmaster contracts with certain venues allowed charities and non-profits to do their own ticketing. Despite the band\u2019s best efforts, the tour became a logistical nightmare. Eventually, Pearl Jam canceled the tour \u201cin protest,\u201d but in truth, it became impossible to pull off at the level that Pearl Jam was at without working with Ticketmaster, which according to the band, proved Ticketmaster was truly a monopoly.\n\nDespite the Vs. tour being a disaster, the situation significantly helped raise awareness about the issue. Investigative journalist Chuck Philips continued to stay on the story, and was able to obtain copies of the contracts venues were forced to sign with Ticketmaster, and a legal monograph was drafted that concluded, \u201cThe pervasiveness of Ticketmaster\u2019s exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d\n\nMost notably, a United States House of Representatives subcommittee opened an investigation, and on June 30th, 1994, Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament came to Capitol Hill to testify in front of the committee. It caused quite a stir in both the national news, as well as entertainment news when two grunge rockers dressed in grunge attire appeared before Congress, giggling initially as they were sworn in by the subcommittee.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.savingcountrymusic.com/mad-at-ticketmaster-pearl-jam-has-you-beat-by-28-years/",

My understanding has been that artists don\u2019t make any more money on the resale tickets - Ticketmaster double dips on fees so maybe she\u2019s benefitting in that way, but if someone purchases a ticket for $200 and then resells it for $1000, they\u2019re profiting $800 minus whatever the fees are. That\u2019s not Taylor Swift making an extra $800 on that ticket so I don\u2019t understand what the benefit is for an artist to allow resale like that. \n\nI\u2019m not defending Taylor Swift here, I heard Ed Sheeran and other artists don\u2019t allow their tickets to be resold higher than face value and if they can do it, she can do it. I just think we\u2019re talking about different things here.",

By the time my slot was open, more than half the arena was on resale sites at 200%+ cost and the site kept timing out. Then I tried getting Guns n Roses tickets last week and it kept telling me I was a bot. When they finally let me on 20 mins later, there was barely any original tickets left and tons were already on official Ticketmaster resale. I\u2019d rather take time off work to sit in line than deal with this crap. There\u2019s got to be SOMETHING they could do.",

It would take a massive coalition of top-earning artists to topple the ticketmaster monopoly on the open market and they'd also need the next generation of hot up-and-coming artists on board or else ticketmaster just says \"ok then just retire and we'll work with your replacements\".\n\nThe government could finally break them up... but politicians care next to nothing about this issue with only a few exceptions and mostly for twitter clout not anything actionable.",

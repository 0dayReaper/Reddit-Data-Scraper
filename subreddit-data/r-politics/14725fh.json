He also flipped a district in 2018 that was considered un-flippable when he first dove into a primary field of 8+ candidates. The field included some serious locals and one out of state guy with Clinton money behind him. He\u2019s been through the fire, and is frankly a better and more experienced politician than Beto at this point.",

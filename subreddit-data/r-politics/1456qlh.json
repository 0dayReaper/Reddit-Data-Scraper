We lived this every day and our local government had no interest in addressing the growing problem.  We finally had enough and sold our home. \nI loved being in Portland for more than 30 years.  I don't have all the answers but please give some courtesy to the home/property owners who deal with the flip side of mass camping.",

It\u2019s not heartless in and of itself. \n\nI was homeless for a little over three years in my late teens/early twenties. I saw a lot of people like me trying to find a way out while flying under the radar but I also saw a ton of people who were openly antagonistic to property owners. Those people cause a lot of damage and trouble. \n\nUnfortunately it seems every policy is much more weighted to the latter and good people with hard luck get swept up in the response. I don\u2019t see what good this will really do, especially with likely very selective enforcement. \n\nIt makes me feel like a selfish hypocrite but one of my first moves once I escaped that life was to get to a place with no homeless because it\u2019s scary even when you\u2019re one of them. Few people can deal with that day in and day out.",

Normally I don\u2019t talk about it. \n\nIt started with family who figured out I was gay. Shortly after I got the boot I was introduced to opiates, which seemed to make the entire situation much more bearable but of course made things so much worse. Just dug further into the hole for a few years, first couch surfing then car camping then full on street homeless. I decided no one was going to pull me out so I\u2019d do what it took. \n\nI started sex work and selling certain products that I already had access to from my addiction, and started making attempts to get clean. I made enough to get an apartment which then allowed me to get a job, and built from there. Once I had some slight stability I escaped to a flyover state and got out of cities. \n\nGot clean, got better and better jobs and quit all illegal work, got a car, then ended up married somehow to another formerly homeless guy and stumbled my way into a big house and yard with dogs and a nicer car. \n\nNow I\u2019m fat and in the type of job and environment where people would just laugh and call bullshit if they knew my history. I\u2019m boring as fuck and follow all laws, don\u2019t even speed or drink. This is ten years clean in a couple months. I even reconciled with my mother.",

It almost seems like it\u2019s too far gone. These people can\u2019t make their own decisions, whether it\u2019s due to mental illness or addiction or both. About a month ago, a woman gave birth to a baby on a sidewalk in San Francisco. The baby literally plopped out of her on to the cold dirty cement. The woman was a complete mess. Totally fucked up. It\u2019s people like her that clearly cannot make the decisions for themselves. For the sake of her and her baby, she should have been admitted to some sort of in patient treatment where she couldn\u2019t leave. And I\u2019m not sure you can make an argument where living in the gutters would be a better outcome for her and her baby, that likely isn\u2019t even in her custody any more. Go ahead and search for the video on Reddit, you\u2019ll find it quickly. \n\nWhen it comes to shelter beds, there are a shitload of them available in the Bay Area, CA. A family member works for a shelter network in the South Bay. They perform outreach daily trying to get the homeless to come to the number of shelters they operate. They visit the encampments under the overpasses, the parks, and even the MASSIVE encampments that people set up along the creeks and storm drains. They offer beds, treatment resources, and therapy for free. All you have to do is commit to being sober. Guess what most say? \u201cFuck off.\u201d A staggering amount of the homeless in the Bay Area are completely fine with their way of life. They can get high and drunk without a care in the world and live by their own rules. If that means they live in a tent in Downtown San Jose, so be it. They literally do not care. Clearly a sign of severe mental illness because nobody in their right mind should be find living like that. But they\u2019re all basically allowed to live that way, so it brings us back to the question of wtf do we do? These people are killing themselves. How do you help people who refuse it?",

Want them to leave? dont be accommodating. Allow the ones who actually want help and to get their lives back on track to be helped but the majority who dont need to be treated poorly. Thats the tough fucked up news no one wants to hear",

Have you tried finding a public restroom in those cities? Why are there no public restrooms? We started ripping them out during gay panic when people were scaremongering that they were being used as gay sex dens that spread AIDS, then the rest went away to War On Drugs so no nefarious druggies would use them to shoot up. Of course, as noted now they use them on the streets. Big improvement.\n\nEverything that is happening right now is the result of bad policies and the solution isn't going to be making One Good Wish. It's build a lot of toilets, it's have more trash cans, it's safe injection sites, it's build more housing, it's fill empty houses, etc etc etc.",

Within the week they are either set on fire or covered in shit smeared all over them. They put up specific areas for people to go and they turn into 3rd world countries. Feces and needles everywhere. \n\nThey do put more toilets and trash cans, they all end up on fire. They have safe injection sites and they turn into gross ass areas. Its not the responsibility of the city to provide housing for free to homeless people. There are no empty houses, portland real estate is one of the hottest inthe country and there is no inventory right now. \n\n\nYes this is a problem. But the problem is the poeple on drugs. They need to be removed from the city and treated. Where? I dont know but allowing them free reign in the city while providing zero tax dollars to the city isnt the answer. The way it works now is the entire city of portland is paying for the homeless to have TONS of services provided to them for free. How do they respond? destroying everything in sight, camping and using the bathroom in public areas, and stealing from local businesses who are literally paying extra taxes to support them. \n\n\nIts sad for them and their situatiuon is fucked up, but the average citizen is not to blame and shouldnt be on the hook to fix their problems for them. They should be given the resources to fix their problem themselves. Sadly a majority just flat out do not want to improve their lives. They just want more drugs. Why work when you can get fucked up and hang out all day?",

If you haven\u2019t been there, it\u2019s hard to describe how badly Portland is on its ass right now. The encampments are everywhere and petty crime is rampant. I left, along with a lot of people I know, because the city, particularly the downtown I used to love, is a mess and will take years to come back.  All the policies so far have been accommodating towards the homeless, but you have to counterbalance that with maintenance of a functioning, livable city. And solutions like \u201cend capitalism\u201d are a waste of time to debate, because they just won\u2019t happen, so you can stop proposing ridiculousness.",

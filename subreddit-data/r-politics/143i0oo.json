Not just barracks, and flag officer housing...\n\n&gt;And I doubt this shit is happening at schools on the base, the military doesn\u2019t fuck around like that and will get on their parents asses.\n\nBullying is a common thing in those schools too. Less you are referring to something other than DoD run K-12 ones. School cultures much as on post command cultures at times reflect what goes on in the surrounding community over all. For better, and for worse. So, if the community surrounding the military installation is horrible, and toxic it leaks in to on post stuff too. Not to even mention how in service some commands, and installations seem to be magnets for the worst possible assholes one can run in to. \n\n\nSource: am an Army retiree... \n\n&gt; I image this is happening all off line where they don\u2019t press their jurisdiction as much (not directly but they have ways to make your life miserable).\n\nNo offense, but this sentence makes little sense... what are you trying to say?",

I think this is one area where republicans really didn\u2019t think through the ramifications of supporting abortion prohibition without exceptions. While the majority of pro-birth politicians said they supported vaguely defined exceptions, there were more than a few that supported bans without exceptions. And their dedication to avoiding nuanced discussions of abortion in favor of painting the stereotype of promiscuous women getting multiple abortions as their chosen form of birth control meant that it never occurred to their base that the ban might actually affect them. But pregnancy complications don\u2019t discriminate along party line. Any woman can develop an ectopic pregnancy, placenta accreta, incomplete abortion (miscarriage), eclampsia, fetal demise, or have a fetus with anencephaly, or any myriad of other conditions that aren\u2019t conducive to life. And there are very few women willing to die or lose their future fertility for a baby that won\u2019t survive or have a meaningful survival. Military members aren\u2019t going to want to roll the dice with their lives or their spouse\u2019s lives because they get stationed in a state that bans abortions. I do wonder though, military installations have federal jurisdiction, so would a military hospital be able to perform abortions or would they be bound by state laws? Anyways, this is just my perspective as a veteran.",

Reduce that popular acceptance and they become less vocal and less abusive. \n\n2) Money &gt; Ideology nine times out of ten.\n\nWhile a super simplified example, faced with the threat of their economy going directly into the sewer, even bigots will keep their shitty ideas to themselves.

When you cast a woman as a man (*The Year of Living Dangerously*) I think you're changing sex, but maintaining gender. James Barry, the British  Inspector General (Brigadier equivalent)  of hospitals was found in his autopsy to be a woman. Does this mean he changed his gender without changing his sex. Or was he trans-sex?  \nThis is all too confusing, and I agree with the guy who conducted Barry's autopsy ' I don't give a fuck'. (in Victorian English)",

It is the families of military people that are being bullied by the locals within these red states.  The military family has to move to protect their children.  \n\nIt is NOT the military family going around bullying people.  You'd be surprised how LGBTQ friendly our modern military is.  You must remember that the majority of the services are made up of young people under 40.  They tend to be very diverse and actually pretty progressive.  \n\nIt's a real danger to unit readiness that those stationed in red states are having to deal with the loss of rights for either themselves or their families.  Imagine being in the military and having a transgender child right now, stationed in Florida.  That kid is suddenly a 2nd class citizen, denied rights to healthcare needed for them and you are stuck.  You can't just pick up and move because you have to be where the military sends you.  It is gut wrenching.  Or being a woman  in the military who, just because your in Texas, you suddenly just lost the right to get an abortion and have lost domain over your own body and reproduction.  But you can't just leave because your rights and life are in jeopardy.  Its just fucking shitty!",

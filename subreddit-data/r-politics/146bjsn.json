Haha ... as if \"Smith\" is such a famous surname not because it's extremely common ... but because it's some kind of \"fake\" Hollywood last name, like the \"555\" prefix to a phone number.\n\nIt's a little piece of evidence demonstrating how little he's had to handle his own affairs in the real world throughout his life -- he may have realized that he'd known many real \"Smith\"s through the years, and that it was not just a default-sounding last name. Sometimes, things sound plain and common BECAUSE they are actually common.",

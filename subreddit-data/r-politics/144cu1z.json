            "comment": "Right idea, wrong approach. The Article V Constitutional Convention is  disaster waiting to happen.\n\nHe is proposing an Article V Constitutional Convention. From the Governor's official site:\r  \n\r  \n\"Passage of the 28th Amendment will require a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also known as an Article V Convention or amendatory convention. Working in partnership with members of the California State Senate and Assembly, California will be the first state in the nation to call for such a convention with a joint resolution being introduced by California State Senator Aisha Wahab and Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer. The Governor will work with grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation to fight for the passage of similar resolutions in other state legislatures to ensure the convening of a constitutional convention limited to this subject. 33 other states, in addition to California, would need to take action to convene such a convention.\"\r  \n\r  \nThere are literally no rules for actions that can be taken once a Convention is convened. Republicans have been pushing for it for a while now because they want to completely re-write the Constitution to their beliefs (ban on abortion, ban on any gun laws, ban on LGBTQ+ existence, ban on vaccinations, repeal of Social Security and Medicare, etc., etc., etc. ). There is nothing in the Constitution that limits the Amendments to be considered by an Article V convention to a single subject. Once convened it becomes a free for all. The lack of rules and procedures for a Constitutional Convention is one of the reasons it has never been successful since the first one.\r  \n\r  \nArticle V, U.S. Constitution\r  \n\r  \nArticle V\r  \n\r  \n\"The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate\"\r  \n\r  \n.An interesting read by the Congressional Research Service:\r  \n\r  \n[https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42589/15#:\\~:text=The%20second%2C%20generally%20referred%20to,the%20Constitution%20to%20convene%20one](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42589/15#:~:text=The%20second%2C%20generally%20referred%20to,the%20Constitution%20to%20convene%20one).",

It isn't even about constitutionality.  Bruen is barely a year old if that but federal universal background checks have been failing to get passed for well over a decade or so, well before the SCOTUS got stacked by the GOP, because they can't even get the votes in the house and senate.  Fewer votes than needed to amend the constitution.",

No, did you actually read *Heller*? The dissent rightly stated that the correct ruling should have been \"Hey Dick, you already have a right to bear arms, what you're seeking is the right to possess a specific type of firearm that DC has banned. That's not a 2A question, that's a property right question, however *if* you can prove that *this* particular firearm is necessary for self protection, DC ought to let you have it.\" There was no need for the majority to go any further than that. \n\n3.

They're probably in better shape than some of the guns we took over to Afghanistan and Iraq. But I'd be willing to learn how to change a barrel out and clean the bcg up. Maybe fix the coating on the uppers and such. \n\n2. What arms were legal for dick heller to actually own in DC at the time? Inoperable rifles, inoperable shotguns, and revolvers registered 30 years prior?  Creating artificial scarcity to make sure no one of average wealth can afford something for self-defense. Looks really interesting when you consider dick was a security guard for judges. I can see why the court voted the way it did. It'd be kind of weird to have security that walks around with guns you want banned for the average person... \n\n3. Researchers getting paid by an anti gun lobby claim 1/6 of gun homicides are prevented by waiting 3 days? That's what they're claiming here? That those homicides won't happen at after 72 hours? Less than 10% of state inmates that possessed a handgun at the time of their arrest even purchased guns from a FFL. Store, pawn shop, or gun show. So I don't see how a 3 day wait on background checks save 17%. \n\n4. Yeah, you're the reason we won't comply with a Registry. You have an extremist view in that you are willing to ban all guns from civilian ownership. So no, we're good. We won't be giving politicians that share your opinion data on where to send the cops when they decide that something their security guards carry is too dangerous for me to own.",

                    "comment": "Is it, though? \n\n&gt; Raise the minimum age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21. \n\nAmerican standards for the legal age of adulthood are all over the place. You can drive cars at 16, can sign up for the military at 17, can vote at 18, can take out $100k in debt at 18, but you can\u2019t drink a beer, smoke a cigarette, go on a solo cruise (in most cases), or own a gun until 21? I\u2019d agree that it focuses in on the right age range for a significant chunk of shootings: young adult male perps, but I\u2019m unsure of what percentage of these incidents are the result of someone legally purchasing a gun at 18 and then committing a crime with that legally purchased gun. [This](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf) data suggests that only about 10% of guns used in crime across all prisoners were purchased at a retail source to begin with. \n\n&gt; mandate universal background checks, \n\nThe data linked above is relevant here, too. In what situations would these universal background checks apply under the \u201cobtained from individual\u201d column, which is the source of about 25% of guns used in crime? All transfers, whether they\u2019re purchases, rentals, trades, or \u201cborrowing\u201d the gun? To properly enforce this, you\u2019d need so many more heads and hands involved, likely a national database, and a significant expansion of the police force to actually sift through the transfer paperwork and investigate individual transfers that seem to be invalid. \n\n&gt; impose a waiting period on gun purchases \n\nThis is problematic for several reasons, although I don\u2019t fully disagree with some level of short term delay. How long is the period? Days? Weeks? Months? Does it apply to purchases, or all transfers? What about scenarios in which an individual has a near-immediate need for a firearm? Does this *actually* prevent sizable numbers of gun homicides, or just a very small portion of \u201cheat of the moment\u201d scenarios? Certainly people can just plan things in advance to counteract the waiting periods then, right? I just don\u2019t see this having a significant impact on crime reduction, so unless it did have that effect with demonstrable proof, it seems like just another \u201charmless\u201d restriction that actually has no tangible effect on gun violence. \n\n&gt; and ban civilians from buying assault weapons.\n\nWhat\u2019s an assault weapon? Why do they need to be banned instead of having alternative options put in place before banning? Most gun deaths are suicides. Most guns used in gun homicides are handguns, not rifles. Most gun homicides are not the result of mass shootings. Most mass shootings are not school shootings. What are we actually talking about combatting here with this proposal, and how effective will this proposal be at countering said issue?",

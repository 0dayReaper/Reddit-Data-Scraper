They're gonna lock this fucker up. 100% he squeals on Jared, which will have Ivana squealing on daddy, which will have Eric squealing on Ivana, which will make Donald throw Eric under the bus. As usual, Don Jr will be ignored and forgotten. So rich, I love this timeline.",

If you\u2019re planning on taking a deal you negotiate that and at some future hearing change your plea to guilty. \n\nA not guilty plea can be changed to guilty at any time pretty much. But the reverse is not true.",

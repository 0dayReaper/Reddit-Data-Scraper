Can you think of a better use of taxpayer dollars than a (probably) illegal political stunt which doesn\u2019t even happen in the taxpayer\u2019s state?   I mean it even has the added benefit of actively hurting people AND businesses in the state as it is scaring migrant people out of the state, which is screwing industries like construction, food service, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and any business that relies on housekeeping/maintenance/facilities.  It\u2019s like the holy grail use of tax payer money!  It helps DeSantis at the expense of everyone else and it\u2019s illegal, so when that it pointed out, he gets to play the victim!",

It's up to the market to decide\n\n&gt;They inherited it and they spent years finding ways to continue avoiding paying taxes on said billions by hiding them in other countries. \n\nNothing wrong within inheritance. If you want to argue merely for increasing tax enforcement in order to fight tax avoidance/evasion, I'm down with that. Don't need to attack the existence of billionaires to do that\n\nAlso [most billionaires don't get that way by inheriting](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/70-of-billionaires-are-self-made-and-only-30-legacy-11679479214477.html)\n\n&gt;They are literally taking advantage of other people's work and doing nothing real in return for it\n\nAre we... against the mere idea of private control of the means of production here? Or do I misunderstand?\n\n&gt;That's when it gets a bit harder to justify.\n\nPeople don't need to justify their wealth, because we have freedoms. People don't need to justify their use of freedoms, except in cases where clear harm is done in the action\n\n&gt;Face it, billionaires are the only socially acceptable hoarders\n\nYou don't need to be a billionaire in order to hoard\n\nBut also. Socially acceptable? It's pretty socially acceptable for middle class homeowners to hoard wealth by supporting policy that has government artificially restricting supply in order to boost property values\n\n&gt;and we pretend that their form of hoarding is normal and to be lauded.\n\nI don't care about lauding it. Just in the same way as one can defend free speech even if it means the freedom to say horrible things we disagree with, one can defend economic freedoms without caring about judgement of how the freedoms are used",

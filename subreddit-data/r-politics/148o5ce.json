The spending caps were the centerpiece of a hard-fought compromise the GOP leader reached with the White House to avert a catastrophic debt default.   \nDemocrats balked at McCarthy\u2019s move to abandon the deal.  \n\u201cIf we disregard the law of the land, we all but guarantee a government shutdown,\u201d Representative Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said.",

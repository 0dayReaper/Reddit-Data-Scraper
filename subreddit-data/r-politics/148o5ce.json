The spending caps were the centerpiece of a hard-fought compromise the GOP leader reached with the White House to avert a catastrophic debt default.   \nDemocrats balked at McCarthy\u2019s move to abandon the deal.  \n\u201cIf we disregard the law of the land, we all but guarantee a government shutdown,\u201d Representative Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said.",

The Transportation and Housing departments would be hit by a 25% cut.\n\n&gt;Defense spending, which would see a 3% spending increase over current year levels, would be spared. That could ultimately mean a $150 billion cut to non-defense accounts.  \n...  \nHouse Republicans are also eyeing some controversial targets for cuts, including defunding the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into former president Donald Trump. Trump is to be arraigned Tuesday on 37 federal counts pertaining to his mishandling of classified information.\n\nHow will this affect the economy?\n\n&gt;The $120 billion cut proposed by Republicans would slightly slow the economy in a period when it\u2019s already vulnerable, modestly increasing the risk that it tips into recession.",

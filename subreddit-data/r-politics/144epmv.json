But also helped with Operation Warp Speed and was incredibly proud of that. And as you pointed out, even got boo'd for touting it. And then yeah, injecting bleach and light into your lungs, and of, course ivermectin and the other shit. He was pretty anti-mask as well.\n\nThere was also listening to Kushner about letting it run rampant in blue states because they weren't voting for him anyway.\n\nIf he had literally just done nothing, it would still have turned out better.\n\nBut DeSantis, yeah. He was purely against anything that may have actually been helpful.",

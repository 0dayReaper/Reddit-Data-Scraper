The work requirements don't \\[fully\\] go into effect until 2025, which means \\[some\\] people will *not* lose benefits immediately. ~~I'm unsure of the timing of~~ \\[T\\]he exemptions for veterans and homeless people, ~~whether that is immediate or also not until 2025, but, worst case, neither~~ go into effect immediately\\[.\\] ~~and nothing changes at all until 2025, which means it can be repealed and undone before a single person loses any benefits at all~~ \\[I\\]f we elect a Democratic trifecta in 2024\\[,\\] ~~And, of course,~~ they can repeal the increased work requirements while leaving the new exemptions in place. ~~Best case,~~ \\[T\\]the most vulnerable people, the homeless, immediately get an exemption and are helped now, ~~and~~ \\[while\\] the people who lose benefits won't \\[all\\] lose them until 2025\\[.\\] ~~if at all.~~\n\n&gt;A decision was made to sacrifice these people.\n\nIgnoring the timing, and the potential for repeal ~~before anyone even loses anything,~~ the alternative was to sacrifice homeless people and veterans instead, and it would've been a larger sacrifice. Everything involves trade-offs, and while it's unfortunate to have to have anyone lose benefits, if someone must, this seems like a good deal that helps more people than it harms. And, again, elect a Democratic trifecta in 2024 and the cuts can be repealed\\[.\\] ~~before anyone loses anything.~~\n\nEdit to correct my misunderstanding of the bill, and to add:\n\nElections have consequences. If people don't like having to sacrifice anything or anyone, 2022 voters shouldn't have elected a GOP House majority, and none of this would've been necessary in the first place.",

The law would gradually phase in those workers by age, starting with those age 50 from **90 days after the law is enacted** and eventually expanding to include 53- and 54-year-olds in 2024.",

I went to the text of the [actual bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/text?s=1&amp;r=1#toc-H3DCA90B8E547408584D6AAC25BA7A4C6), itself, to confirm which is correct. Mea culpa.\n\nI still say it's a net benefit, just not by as much as I previously thought. The increased work requirements are phased in over the next few years, whereas the exemptions for homeless people and veterans are immediate. And a default would've meant the entire program was in jeopardy immediately, for all recipients, not just those 50-54.\n\nAnd I stand by my second paragraph, that, while I would most prefer not to have any cuts, that wasn't a realistic possibility after 2022 voters elected a GOP House, and if someone must lose benefits, this seems like it's probably the least bad way to do it. Anyone 50-54 who is or becomes homeless will be covered by the new exemption, and anyone 50-54 who's a veteran will be covered by the new exemption as well, and anyone who is or becomes disabled will remain covered by the existing exemption.\n\nAnd it will be possible to repeal the cuts if we elect a Democratic trifecta in 2024. And, of course, to leave in place the exemptions for the homeless and veterans.",

That's an easy choice, because it avoids immediate harm and leaves open the possibility of avoiding delayed harm as well. And avoiding the immediate harm was more urgent, more important, and increases the chances of being able to avoid the delayed harm.\n\nTake the counter case: we default, enter a global recession, millions lose their jobs at the same time the government can no longer provide aid, and the GOP blames it all on Biden and Democrats. Consequently, whoever the GOP nominee ends up being wins with a Republican trifecta, and instead of the modest cuts agreed to now, they make huge cuts, or even eliminate programs. We get immediate extreme harm they can blame on Biden *and* delayed extreme harm.\n\nThat's why more Democrats voted for it than Republicans, because Republicans were trying to sabotage Democrats, and Democrats weren't. Some Republicans even admitted the whole point was to hurt Biden's and Democrats' electoral chances. Because they only care about power.\n\nEven if I'm wrong and they don't repeal the cuts, that's still a better outcome than the alternative Republicans wanted. If you're worried they won't follow through, get to work electing more Democrats so they have bigger margins and more possibility to pick up a vote to make up for losing someone else's. Politics is the art of the possible, and larger margins increase the universe of what's possible.",

There are a lot of things in \"the literal text of the fucking Constitution.\" But can you tell me all of them are met? We have issues with religion, peaceful assembly, guns, searches and seizures, takings, bail, cruel and unusual punishment, a right to vote mentioned five(!) times (14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments), etc. The [Apportionment Clause](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27#xiv2), also in the 14th Amendment, says:\n\n&gt;But when the right to vote at any election . . . is denied to any of the . . . inhabitants of such State, being . . . of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such . . . citizens shall bear to the whole number of . . . citizens . . . of age in such State.\n\nOr the [Disqualification Clause](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27#xiv3), also in the 14th Amendment, says:\n\n&gt;No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nThe only portion of the 14th that's enforced at all is section 1, and that's hit or miss anyway. The Citizenship Clause seems pretty well-followed, but the Privileges or Immunities, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses all leave much to be desired.\n\n&gt;I don't want leaders who will cower in fear and never act under the mindset of \"well SCOTUS might rule against us!\". That's a fucking pathetic mindset and if that is the way we're going to go might as well hand the fascists the keys to power now and save us all the delay.\n\nIt's more complicated than that. An adverse ruling doesn't just harm us now, it's harms us indefinitely, since it'll be another precedent we have to deal with. And even if you end up with a favorable ruling, it can still be chaotic in the interim. If Biden had asserted the debt limit were unconstitutional, it would've been challenged, and the markets could've go into a tailspin, we could've ended up in a recession, millions could've been laid off, etc.\n\nIf SCOTUS ultimately ruled in his favor, great, but the damage would already have been done. And then Biden would still have needed to negotiate a budget while in a terrible economic situation, and the GOP would be screaming about his aUtHoRiTaRiAn PoWeR gRaB the whole time. He'd have had a much weaker hand than he does now. So great, maybe he ultimately wins the fight over the debt limit, but he gets creamed in the 2024 election because of the global recession, because voters blame him for it, and they blame him for what surely would be a much worse budget than we'll end up with now. Is that what you call winning?\n\n&gt;I don't want leaders who will cower in fear and never act\n\nAnd I don't want leaders who will take unnecessary risks with small potential upsides and huge potential downsides just so they can say they're doing something.\n\n&gt;That's a fucking pathetic mindset and if that is the way we're going to go might as well hand the fascists the keys to power now and save us all the delay.\n\nExactly. Discretion is the better part of valor. Don't just hand the fascists the keys to power because you're impatient and want to do something.",

Biden could've made that case but he decided to gamble that McCarthy would never be able to pass anything. Than he pivoted to the message that a bipartisan solution was the only option. Biden can make deals (this deal, while bad, isn't as bad as the one Obama made in 2011) but he can't reframe an issue to the public with his oratory skills. If he could do that then he would've hammered the GOP and told the country he was invoking the 14th rather than negotiate with terrorists.",

Nor did they cover how wasteful military spending is or the amount it benefits foreign investors in military contractors. \n\nWhy are Republicans trying to start a recession, and put the American economy last and foreigners first?  That's a legitimate question the media can't or won't ask any Republican who demanded these cuts while blindly increasing the deficit to give handouts to Corporations with foreign investors",

What is wrong with 50-54 year old able-bodied people without children being required to work 20hrs/week, volunteer, or spend that amount of time in a program that helps them find work in order to receive SNAP assistance? The exemptions seem fair. I'm a left-leaning independent, but I am struggling to see the problem with this requirement being extended to this range. It is already in place for those under 50. Is the argument that we shouldn't have this in place for all able-bodied people without children no matter their age?  I don't want to argue it. I'm really seeking out the reasons people believe this is bad policy.",

For example, when you increase red tape, it is known that many will fall through the cracks, not answering the forms on time, making mistakes on the forms...and will be denied benefits they need and otherwise deserve. In this case, another example of it being cruel is that it is very difficult to find work when that old. Employers prefer younger workers....so many will not meet the qualification to receive help but will still need to eat...",

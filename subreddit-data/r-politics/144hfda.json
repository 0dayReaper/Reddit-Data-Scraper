That cost the state millions, including monies paid to pr firms who were hired and fired at a speed that makes me seriously doubt they did anything for the hundreds of thousands they were paid. He started his own, state-ran news service (JustIN) which didn't amount to more than a short lived website due to public outrage. Without public debate, cut funding for public schools in order to send loans to charter schools. Then blamed those public schools for having below average test scores. Denied and overly politicized Syrian refugees. Ignored infrastructure to the point roads and bridges crumbled and caused closures that lasted months. Ensured state departments only had the bare minimum staffs required by law. All these things were accomplished in 2015 alone. He was governor from 2013-2017, just imagine all the horrible things he managed to accomplish in all those other years. From the bottom of my heart, fuck mike pence.",

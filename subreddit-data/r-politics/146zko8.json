And despite the opposing party still pushing for the investigation and arrest of this person there continues to be zero ***tangible evidence*** of any wrong doing.\n\nThe other was investigated, there are mountains of evidence, the investigation was obstructed multiple times, and during that investigation they found enough to bring 37 federal charges. And despite the opposing party calling for the investigation and arrest of this person the evidence *continues* to pile up...like boxes of classified materials in an unsecured bathroom and video!\n\nNow - one of two things is happening here. Either:\n\n1. There is a shadowy cabal of well connected and wealthy people that has implanted itself at the highest level of government and their soul purpose is to take down the now former president. They did this so masterfully in the 2020 election that despite numerous lawsuits claiming that the election was stolen not a shred of evidence could be produced because this highly complex organization erased all of their tracks so completely its like they were never there at all and are able to fabricate and plant that amount of evidence without *any* witness or leaks.\n\n\\- or -\n\n2) Trump, through the last 6 years of being a national embarrassment on a global scale, and one of the leakiest administrations I can recall in my life, as well as the ensuing devolution of our country as a paragon of freedom and equality literally split by the GOPs hate filled march towards fascism with their latest boogieman to rile up their supporters - and it will be remembered as a point of shame in our country. Having now been the subject of multiple investigations - leading to dozens of federal indictments, including hard evidence that not only did he know the items were *still classified* but that he showed it to random people, after all the lies he's been caught in again and again, somehow they can still look at Trump and think 'yep, this is a witch hunt.'",

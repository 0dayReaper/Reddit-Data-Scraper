At the Hamburg State Archive, I read about H. Bode, who often went out in public dressed as a woman and dated men. Under the Weimar Republic, she held a transvestite certificate. Nazi police went after her for \u201ccross-dressing\u201d and for having sex with men. They considered her male, so her relationships were homosexual and illegal. They sent her to the concentration camp Buchenwald, where she was murdered.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Liddy Bacroff of Hamburg also had a transvestite pass under the Republic. She made her living selling sex to male clients. After 1933, the police went after her. They wrote that she was \u201cfundamentally a transvestite\u201d and a \u201cmorals criminal of the worst sort.\u201d She too was sent to a camp, Mauthausen, and murdered.\n\nSource: [https://theconversation.com/historians-are-learning-more-about-how-the-nazis-targeted-trans-people-205622](https://theconversation.com/historians-are-learning-more-about-how-the-nazis-targeted-trans-people-205622)\n\nThis hate MUST be condemned as the anti-American divisive rhetoric that it is.",

I would argue that the creator of Minecraft became a billionaire ethically by basically creating and selling something massively popular. Pity he turned out to be a racist piece of shit anyway. \n\nBut a theoretical similar person could become a billionaire and even remain one ethically as long as the excess gains beyond a reasonable life of luxury were dedicated to social good. Even without giving them up immediately, they could be placed in a trust, invested to support good causes, and/or be strategically allocated to build a self-perpetuating engine of good works. \n\nNo one who has ever become a billionaire has been this kind of person though, to my knowledge. At best, we have horrible humans trying to whitewash their names and achieve pseudo-immortality by creating foundations or having university buildings named after them.",

But some quick back-of-the-envelope math shows that this is much harder than it sounds.\n\nI'm going to use Senate elections as an example. In 2020, the Republican in Wyoming won 198,100 to 72,766. So we need to find (to use TFG's terminology) 125,335 votes.\n\nIn California in 2020, 70.88% of eligible voters turned out for the Presidential election and 63.48% voted for Biden, with 34.32% voting for Trump. (There was no Senate election, so this won't be apples-to-apples). So this is almost exactly 45% of eligible voters voted for a Democrat, while 24.33% voted for the Republican.\n\nIf you take exactly these numbers, to reach a net 125,335 votes for the Democrat in Wyoming, you'd need to transplant 606,365 voters, more than doubling the state's population.\n\nObviously these numbers wouldn't be exact. Perhaps the people moving for this purpose would be more motivated to vote, and perhaps they'd be more blue than your average Californian. On the other hand, perhaps they'd be younger and far less likely to vote than your average Californian.\n\nI still think it would be a good long-term plan for Democrats to try to \"seed\" these low population states with younger, more liberal people, but it certainly wouldn't show an immediate effect. That complicates things quite a bit, because we're talking decades before these people who move would be able to start seeing the kind of society they want to build.",

I\u2019m here to try to keep Missouri from further losing its left-leaning voters; we used to be a purple state in the 90s, and it can be done again. But not if we leave.\n\nThat said, I empathize with the trans folks and their families who feel the need to leave in wake of the recent anti-trans legislation. Even more of a reason for us allies to stay and fight for them while they get someplace safe.",

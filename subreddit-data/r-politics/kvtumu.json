First for being the Confederate flag, and second for breaking the \"No seals on flags\" rule.\n\nAlso, before people comment, \"deface\" is a neutral term in vexillology. It just means adding another element to a flag to distinguish it, like how so many flags in Commonwealth realms are \"Union Jack in the canton, plus distinguishing element in the field\"\n\nEDIT: The [First National Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861%E2%80%931863%29.svg/255px-Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861%E2%80%931863%29.svg.png) is different from the [battle flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Confederate_Rebel_Flag.svg/220px-Confederate_Rebel_Flag.svg.png). The latter is actually an elongated version of the actual, square flag the army marched to in battle. The former was the equivalent to things like the Star-Spangled Banner or the Union Jack.",

If you remove the ring of stars and text, I would rank it up there as one of the absolute best state flags in the country. But currently, it's one of too many state flags that contain seals and/or text. (Oregon is still the worst, though, because it has two distinct sides)",

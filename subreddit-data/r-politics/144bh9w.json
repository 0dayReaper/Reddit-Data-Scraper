It was the Supreme Court that swooped in with a 5-4 decision to stay that order, keeping the racially discriminatory map for the 2022 election.\n\nI guess Brett Kavanaugh still has some shame and Robert\u2019s convinced him to flip back now. Although he gets very little credit for doing so now *after* the 2022 election. \n\n[Here\u2019s a great podcast episode](https://www.fivefourpod.com/episodes/merrill-v-milligan/) reviewing the earlier opinion of the district court. It was such a blatant violation of the Voting Rights Act that the two Trump appointed judges on the 3 panel court agreed that Alabama should redraw it.",

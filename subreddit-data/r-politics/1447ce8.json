            "comment": "&gt;Trump has also reportedly received a letter from the Justice Department. It told him that he is under federal investigation, another key sign that an indictment could be forthcoming. The purpose of such letters is to give the recipient the opportunity to provide evidence or testify to a grand jury in their defense after the prosecution has questioned other key witnesses and figures connected to the investigation.\n\nWould love to hear what his attorneys will produce and argue. \"Our client has been treated unfairly.

If he were to get house arrest how would that be a deterrent? It would say you could steal Gov secrets and sell them to Adversaries and all you\u2019ll have to do is wear an ankle bracelet for a few months. \n\nDon\u2019t see that happening at all if convicted at trial and I would certainly expect DOJ to go with the standard sentencing minimums.\n\nEdit: spelling",

There is a lot of precedent for anyone who is known to the general public at all getting away with either no consequences or barely a slap on the wrist, even when publicly available evidence is clear and damning. It would be a pleasant surprise if they did turn that around, but also if they did it in only this case, and for example, continue to allow public officials to invest in industries that they regulate, effectively insider trading... It wouldn't look like a fair system. And I'm not just talking about Pelosi there, it seems like a common practice, senators don't get paid enough to become millionaires so fast.",

It\u2019s all about buttery males!*\n\nSir, I'm asking if you plead guilty or not guilty?\n\n*Look, having nuclear\u2014my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart \u2014you know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I\u2019m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world\u2014it\u2019s true!\u2014but when you\u2019re a conservative Republican they try\u2014oh, do they do a number\u2014that\u2019s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune\u2014you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged\u2014but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me\u2014it would have been so easy, and it\u2019s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what\u2019s going to happen and he was right\u2014who would have thought?), but when you look at what\u2019s going on with the four prisoners\u2014now it used to be three, now it\u2019s four\u2014but when it was three and even now, I would have said it\u2019s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don\u2019t, they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it\u2019s gonna take them about another 150 years\u2014but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.*\n\nI need a one or two word answer. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?\n\n*Take a look at some of the court rulings against the Obama administration. They talked about inhumane treatment. I read them; I looked at them. They\u2019re all over the place. Inhumane treatment. They were treating them terribly. We have a situation where some of these places, they're really running them well. And I give a lot of credit to Secretary Nielsen and all of the people that have worked this. It's the nicest that people have seen. But it's still something that shouldn't be taking place. My wife, our First Lady, is down now at the border because it really bothered her to be looking at this and to seeing it, as it bothered me, as it bothered everybody at this table. We're all bothered by it. But we need two to tango.* \n\nWill you please instruct your client, the defendant, to plead guilty or not guilty?\n\n*Well, the FBI told us they\u2019ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. Here there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn\u2019t know the location. They didn\u2019t know the time. They didn\u2019t know the year. They didn\u2019t know anything. And it\u2019s like, where do you go? Also, it\u2019s not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden he said, they don\u2019t do this. And he said it very clearly. So I think when you really look at it all, it\u2019s not going to change any of the Democrats, they\u2019re obstructionists. They\u2019re actually con artists, because they know how quality this man is, and they have destroyed a man\u2019s reputation. And they want to destroy it even and I think people are going to see that in the mid terms. What they have done to this family, what they have done to these children. These beautiful children of his. And what they have done to his wife.*\n\nYour honor, I believe my client pleads Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Defect or Deficiency. Obviously.",

Checkmate lib.\u201d\n\nWell, he\u2019ll have been arrested twice after this, with a few more coming down the pipeline. Like it or not, these are consequences and a deterrent for future Presidents. The most important indictment on that front is for J6. We don\u2019t want another wannabe dictator to look at Trump\u2019s lack of consequences as a reason to try a coup themselves.",

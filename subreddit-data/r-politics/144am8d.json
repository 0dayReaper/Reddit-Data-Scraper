But I\u2019ll still play ball, but this is as far as I go with the convo as this debate style (as seen on TV!) is what\u2019s wrong with both sides of the isle. As a staunch democrat, I agree. They\u2019re pretty bad and the worst of what American politics has to offer. Anyone who asks for a blanket pardon for their hypocrisy should be removed from office. The clear and blatant insider trading that Nancy P and her husband were engaged in is unforgivable, and politicians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to conduct that kid of financial transaction as they\u2019re public servants. But saying Biden is unable to speak is fucking dumb. He speaks softly and carries a big stick that idiots on both sides don\u2019t realize are making them gape with clown makeup on while asking their constituents \u201cam I pretty now\u201d; it\u2019s a fucking wonderful show.\n\nSo, now that I played ball and answered your question, would you care to answer what I asked earlier in the thread? And, if not a direct a answer, an \u201cin good-faith debate\u201d style response would be sincerely well received.\n\nEdit - corrected tense, spacing, follow up question, and punctuation.",

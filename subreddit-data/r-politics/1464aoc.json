It's a moving and inspiring scene, but whoever thought you could just lift that monologue and drop it on a political ad is a fucking idiot.",

Of course, Goebbels and Hitler knew how to penetrate through to the instincts of their audiences; but in the deeper sense they derived their whole existence from these audiences. Certainly the masses roared to the beat set by Hitler's and Goebbels' baton; yet they were not the true conductors. The mob determined the theme. To compensate for misery, insecurity, unemployment, and hopelessness, this anonymous assemblage wallowed for hours at a time in obsessions, savagery and license. The personal unhappiness caused by the breakdown of the economy was replaced by a frenzy that demanded victims. By lashing out at their opponents and vilifying the Jews, they gave expression and direction to fierce primal passions.\"\n- Albert Speer, Inside the Third Reich",

If you read the fine, very small print at the bottom, it says only 5% of your donation goes towards the legal fees or whatever the email/donation page is for. The other 95% he can do whatever he wants with. \n\nFor a man with so much money, I find it sickening that he begs for money from some of the poorest in the country. Not to mention, one of those sites set up recurring payments without the donors' knowledge.\n\nThis is a cult, and it is designed to keep the people uninformed and in a state of panic that they'll do whatever he asks for fear their leader will crumble if they don't. The sad reality is that this isn't a political witch hunt, and he will likely crumble. There are still open investigations against him, and he just lost his last two decent lawyers.\n\nBased on the evidence discussed in the current indictment, I don't see him finding a way out that won't incite the cult. There was a study released that states as many as 12 million Americans believe that using violence to get Trump back in the WH is acceptable.",

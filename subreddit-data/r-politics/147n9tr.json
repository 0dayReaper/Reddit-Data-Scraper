There were something like a dozen judges eligible for this case but like 8 of them had full caseloads and two of the remaining judges work primarily in neighboring districts so it really came down to like a 50/50 shot that it would end up with her. If she doesn't recuse herself, they can file a motion to switch judges and the appeals judges would likely grant it",

The court also chided her for stopping federal investigators from using the files seized from Mar-a-Lago, saying there was no justification for treating Mr. Trump differently from any other target of a search warrant.\"\n\n\nThat last statement highlighted that she already showed favoritism towards Trump (regardless of reason) and would be grounds for recusal.\n\nI don't see her keeping the case, but I also never expected Trump to win in 2016.  So, what the hell do I know.",

If Trump gets elected while actually being prosecuted, this country deserves what it will get. Full on fascism and a god emperor that will never leave. The fact that this is a possible scenario is enough to disprove American exceptionalism.",

I used to be an appellate chief in the 11th Circuit (where Florida is) and I litigated a few appeals where we asked the court of appeals to order a judge to recuse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Altho a judge's behavior in court generally doesn't form the basis for recusal, the 11th Circuit has ordered \"reassignment\" where a judge leans so heavily for a defendant they call their objectivity in the eyes of the public into question. (US v. Martin)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is persuasive authority that Judge Cannon must step aside if the case falls to her as a permanent assignment. Her court &amp; certainly the 11th won't tolerate the damage it would do to their credibility if she failed to voluntarily recuse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is not clear Cannon is permanently assigned to the case. If she is, it's extremely unlikely it stays with her and as a last resort, DOJ will challenge her participation and win.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1667166126881619969](https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1667166126881619969)",

That avoided a potential legal fight over venue, but it carried the risk that the case would be assigned to Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump and who has issued a series of rulings unusually favorable to him.

There is an [absolutely scathing ruling](https://www.lawfareblog.com/11th-circuit-vacates-cannons-order-appoint-special-master-mar-lago-investigation) from the 11th circuit on this exact same case; detailing how she interfered with the DOJ, overstepped her authority, and was *not impartial. And if appealed, it will go to the same circuit (although probably a different panel). That's everything you could possibly hope for to win an appeal to replace her.\n\nBut that's IF they need to appeal and if she doesn't recuse. I think it's still 50/50. But it gets more difficult to do the further they get into pre-trial, so I anticipate some early posturing to force her into making statements.",

Plenty of conservatives are done with him, and it\u2019s really hard to win a US presidential election if you don\u2019t turn out your own party AND a lot of independents.

Even if it doesn't happen as quickly as we'd like, that strategy will be diminishing returns for them. They will continue to bleed support one way or another, even if it isn't as much as some of us wish it was.

This broad discretion is rarely used, because it allows a judge to substitute their own judgment for that of the jury. But it does exist and, more important for our purposes, it is completely unreviewable. For reasons of double jeopardy, if a judge dismisses a case at the close of the prosecutor\u2019s presentation, that\u2019s the end of it.

That level of fatal.  \n\nThe state cannot appeal that dismissal because the state cannot fuck up the trial and then ask for a second chance. \n\nBut that rule is so narrow and if a judge used that rule to dismiss a case as part of a corrupt bargain, you would probably see some sort of extraordinary relief being sought by the government.\n\nThere are so many other ways that a judge who is in the tank for Trump could affect the proceedings with minimal risk of an appeal that that is just really unlikely to happen. \n\nIf the case stays in front of Judge cannon, here is what I do think is fairly likely. \n\n1.  The timing of the case will be bent in whatever manner seems favorable to trump.  It is likely to get dragged out.\n\n 2.   Defense Counsel motions, no matter how outwardly silly, will be treated with absolute seriousness.  The government will be given the full statutory time to respond and the judge will schedule Hearing in the due course of time. \n\n3.  The thumb will be on the scale as far as the admissibility of evidence. She may let Trump make arguments in the defense that other judges with bar from being in front of the jury. It's possible she may keep the prosecutor from making similar arguments. \n\nAnything above is up to the discretion of the judge. So it's difficult to appeal. \n\nFinally, the nightmare scenario is that Trump is convicted and she simply holds a sentencing Hearing and lets trump off with nearly no punishment. \n\nThat is appealable, but caselaw establishes a LOT of discretion for judges to deviate from sentencing guidelines.",

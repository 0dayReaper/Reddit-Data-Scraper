I know it'd be convenient circlejerk but these people aren't THAT stupid, even they know when something is utterly crazy and even they can't deny it or circle around it (abortion pill, section 230, voting rights recently, etc.) Even with this judge being who it is, there are so many eyes on her and so much pressure that I doubt there's any chance she does anything crazy lol",

While there is a 70-day clock ticking, that clock stops every time she decides to grant a delay. Every time she makes a dubious ruling that the prosecution then has to appeal, that causes a delay. She does not have to delay much for this case to be pushed into the 2024 election cycle which would delay it further and if Trump then gets elected - the case gets dismissed.\n\nAside from delays, she determines which evidence is allowed and which is not. So she may rule that the notes from Trump's former lawyer, Evan Corcoran, which he was forced to turn over are inadmissible (and other important evidence). Not only can this weaken the prosecution's case if these types of rulings are allowed to stand but even if they get overturned by a higher court each time the prosecution has to appeal her rulings the case is delayed.\n\nShe controls the clock, and time, in the end, may save Trump from prison.",

She has infinite tools at her disposal to thwart the prosecution at nearly every turn. Big swings, like tossing out the whole case\u2014a very real possibility in her courtroom of chaos\u2014can be appealed and overturned. But at every step, there are opportunities for sabotage. Cannon can try to rig voir dire to help the defense stack the jury with Trump supporters. She can exclude evidence and testimony that\u2019s especially damning to Trump. She can disqualify witnesses who are favorable to the prosecution. She can sustain the defense\u2019s frivolous objections and overrule the prosecution\u2019s meritorious ones. She can direct a verdict of acquittal to render the jury superfluous. She can declare a mistrial prematurely for any number of reasons, including lengthy juror deliberations, and stretch out various deadlines to run out the clock. Many of these procedural moves could not be appealed until the proceedings have drawn to a close; appeals courts do not referee every little dispute in a jury trial as they happen. Cannon will be in control.\"\n\nOk ok I know this is Slate. But still.",

She\u2019s part of the machine they\u2019ve been building: loyal judges designed to give them wins in the courts.  Be it redistributing, abortion, social security or whatever issue they want to take up.  They packed the courts pretty well under Trump and they\u2019ve been handing out controversial wins.   \n\nCannon\u2019s last go at things was an embarrassment for her, but she\u2019s got a lifetime appointment, so what does she care?  \n\nTrump doesn\u2019t need to win his case, he just needs to run the clock out, something he\u2019s proven to be pretty good at.  If he\u2019s re-elected, he can order his case dismissed: mission accomplished.  Trump firing two of his attorneys is another delay tactic that\u2019ll allow his next attorneys to reasonably argue for time to get caught up on the case\u2014Trump is still entitled to a fair trial, right?  \n\nIt would be nice to see the courts speed this up, but that\u2019s not going to happen, is it?  Why would Aileen do that?  She should recuse herself, but she\u2019s not going to.  She\u2019s right where she wants to be.  Buckle up folks, this going to be a horror show.  I can\u2019t believe those above her even allowed her name to be part of the pool of judges in the running to oversee this case, but here we are.  \n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see the law bend over backwards again and again for Trump.  They all know what he\u2019s doing, and while he continues to gaslight the situation, they keep giving him space to stir things up.  Why won\u2019t they tell him and his attorneys that they\u2019re stuck with one another until the case is over?  The evidence that\u2019s been made public looks like a knockout, but what happens if Aileen picks a bunch of sketchy jurors?  The State appeals and Trump wins extra time to push the next trial past the 2024 election.  \n\nLifetime appointments should be looking pretty stupid to Americans right about now.  Clarence Thomas and Aileen Cannon are the inept standouts at the moment.  Trump\u2019s other appointments are keeping their heads down.  \n\nTrump\u2019s unexpected win in 2016 went to the GOP\u2019s heads and they went into overdrive, packing the courts with as many Federalists Society members as they could and they might be wishing they hadn\u2019t now as their most recent appointees might haven given up the game.",

Box count in the indictment shows some went to Bedminster and never came back.  Reporting states the document referred to in the audio is missing (hence why it wasn't charged as disseminating, its not one of the 31).  People have been openly wondering why Bedminster hasn't been searched.\n\nGov't has Trump in Miami on Tue, good chance to raid Bedminster.   \n\nThe gov't walking out with more documents that Nauta can be charged with conspiracy on, a whole separate set of charges, as he's being arraigned on these is a serious power play.  Perhaps Nauta is concerned they can place him in Ivana's vicinity last July?",

Freyd, PhD:   \n\n&gt;DARVO refers to a reaction perpetrators of wrong doing, particularly sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\" The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim -- or the whistle blower -- into an alleged offender. This occurs, for instance, when an actually guilty perpetrator assumes the role of \"falsely accused\" and attacks the accuser's credibility and blames the accuser of being the perpetrator of a false accusation.",

It was done for political reasons.\u201dWhat are those political reasons? Trump claimed the timing of his indictment was to \u201ccover up a massive crime\u201d perpetrated by Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to do a distraction,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably come up with a jaywalking charge on Hunter in the future, a very small charge, so they can say it was fair.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, complained about the last presidential election, which he decidedly lost. \u201cIf you look at the disaster of the 2020 election, with all the things that have been found that the courts don\u2019t want to work on, they don\u2019t want to discuss,\u201d Trump said before adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll make America great again.\u201d\n\nRead more at: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-calls-for-protests-indictment-roger-stone-1234768826/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-calls-for-protests-indictment-roger-stone-1234768826/)",

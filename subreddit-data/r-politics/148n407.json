It says libraries will lose their funding if they remove books from the shelf based on someone\u2019s personal or partisan disapproval.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cHere in Illinois, we don\u2019t hide from the truth, we embrace it,\u201d said Pritzker in a statement. \u201cYoung people shouldn\u2019t be kept from learning about the realities of our world; I want them to become critical thinkers, exposed to ideas that they disagree with, proud of what our nation has overcome, and thoughtful about what comes next.\u201d*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cEveryone deserves to see themselves reflected in the books they read, the art they see, the history they learn. In Illinois, we are showing the nation what it really looks like to stand up for liberty.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYay! Way to go, Illinois! This is how you step up and shut down Moms for Christian nationalism!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA society without the freedom to read is not a free society at all!",

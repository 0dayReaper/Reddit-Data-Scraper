It says libraries will lose their funding if they remove books from the shelf based on someone\u2019s personal or partisan disapproval.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cHere in Illinois, we don\u2019t hide from the truth, we embrace it,\u201d said Pritzker in a statement. \u201cYoung people shouldn\u2019t be kept from learning about the realities of our world; I want them to become critical thinkers, exposed to ideas that they disagree with, proud of what our nation has overcome, and thoughtful about what comes next.\u201d*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cEveryone deserves to see themselves reflected in the books they read, the art they see, the history they learn. In Illinois, we are showing the nation what it really looks like to stand up for liberty.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYay! Way to go, Illinois! This is how you step up and shut down Moms for Christian nationalism!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA society without the freedom to read is not a free society at all!",

We were one of the first states to shut things down during COVID, we have declared ourselves a safe haven for women seeking an abortion and now this among other things. We aren't without our faults and sadly I live in the southern part of the state but I'm thankful for the forward acting government we have had in place the last few years",

There was a guy that would stand in an empty parking lot here in IL near STL and hand them out. I tried to converse with him one time on why he dislikes him but couldn't honestly make a coherent sentence. I think he was mentally ill talking about being in the military and flying planes and yeah I just left him to it. \n\nI might not agree with him totally but he's exactly what a leader should be and has been a leader since day 1. I'd vote for him for governor or consider voting for him for President.",

Like a lot of rural america in my opinion the people are kind, they are outgoing, its a fairly safe area but the minute someone brings up Democrats or politics their heads spin and they can't help themselves from being ignorant. That being said the schools here are great, they let the kids express themselves, my daughters Civics teacher was open and honest about Trump being indicted and what it means and what the next steps are. No \"he's innocent\" or \"its a witch hunt\" or \"its fine\". He talked about how historical this was and things of that nature. I'm happy here but man if you mention Biden or Democrats or JB on the Facebook town page, people lose their damn minds. Not all but its easily 2/3 vs 1/3 when that situation arises.",

Cost of living is going up but it is still really reasonable. It's not that crowded. Could use a few more restaurants.\n\nI grew up about 30 miles south.

I've never lived anywhere else, so taxes are, just what they are to me, and I get a somewhat larger sized refund at the end of the tax year.  \n\n\nThere is pockets of cultures, my area is very Hispanic, and where I was from in Central had a lot of Asian exchange students. There are plenty of food options in larger cities, and from what I have seen, not as much... vitriol against people in them. A few crazy literal neighbors, but most people are too busy existing to really do much. Like when COVID was a problem, most people in my area just wore a mask and lived with it, a minority of them refused and threw unexplainable fits or wore the mesh masks.   \n\n\nThe area can be pretty, but I will say other states are prettier to me. We have Starved Rock. We have the Cahokia mounds. We have little things like Rockhome Gardens. Apple orchards, pumpkin farms, if you don't mind driving a little bit. I don't like the cold, but nothing specific to this state makes me want to leave.",

Hairy palms from masturbation. Can't get pregnant in a hot tub. VERY wrong info about where the damn clit is. Just mindblowingly stupid. \n\nPut the books in the library and let the kids learn the truth about their bodies and what they may experience. It's not forceful to put it there and let them check it out of they so choose.\n\nMy parents didn't give me the sex talk. I learned everything from either word of mouth from other 13 year olds, or from my brother's hidden porno videos.\n\nThe porn videos were far more educational, honestly. But also definitely not how I should have learned about anatomy.",

I know we traditionally think of conservatives for their book burning and it's warranted, but I also feel contempt for liberals that want to restrict the flow of information in the name of disinfo and misinfo campaigns. Libraries have traditionally been a place where you can check out anything you are interested in reading. You can check out a Quaran or the Bible, you can check out the Biography or Malcolm X or a copy of some god awful Bill O'Reilly book (there are too many lol). Would love to see this kind of legislation in other states and an extension of it applied to online information.  Not all books are created equal, but people tend to disagree on what is true and worthy of distribution all the time so you need to keep it all free and open. Let people come to conclusions on their own and engage in discourse. It's an extension of the values of the enlightenment and ultimately democracy.",

It's a form of censorship, since K-12 students usually don't gain exposure to many books outside of the classroom.\n\nI'm currently an undergraduate student, and I'm doubtful that they can be applied to the college level since college students can usually just buy whatever books they want.\n\nAside from schools, I don't think \"book bans\" really affected anywhere else, as States can't just ban eBooks or books from private corporations (i.e. bookstores, publishers, or authors) due to the 1st amendment.",

He hired a partisan postmaster general close to the election who immediately set about dismantling sorting machines which undermined post office potential to process mail quickly.  Trump then told his followers not to vote by mail-in.  \n\nSuddenly mail is delayed or getting lost in post offices in several states (including Georgia, a key battleground state).  150-300k mailin ballots were lost at post offices from a few states having been checked into the system but not delivered (I've seen both numbers as bounding estimates).  \n\nDejoy was then court ordered to scour the facilities in order to get those ballots delivered to the stations on time which was required for them to be legal votes in GA, not sure about other states.  Dejoy refused to comply stating he wouldn't be able to do that because it interfered with typical post office business and he would do it at 8 PM despite states like GA having a 7 PM cutoff.  Ballots were late and thus ruled not legal ballots, at least in GA, and currently have not been counted to my knowledge.  \n\nLater lawsuits may overturn that but this was a clear chain of republican command that managed to deny a ridiculous number of what should have been valid/legal votes.\n\nIn my mind that's a clear trail of partisan cheating beyond just traditional drawing districts funny or suppression tactics.",

At 9 he said four seasons at 11, then at 9:45am he changed it to four seasons landscaping at 11:30. If someone really did make a mistake, a simple call to the hotel would have been good assuming they were welcomed. After all, there was so much time left.  My guess is they announced it first before booking, then four seasons rejected them, and they wanted to save face and not back peddle to not show weakness.",

There's definitely fraud, but we're not going to show you any of it, but if you check out these super legit youtube videos you can SEE it for yourself.\n\nWell, they scheduled the conference for the Four Seasons in Philly. Now, the Four Seasons is a chain of high-quality hotels, so when the conference was announced, that's where people assumed they meant... Shortly thereafter, however, the campaign clarified that it was Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a very... quaint little shop between an Adult Bookstore and a crematorium, surrounded by razorwire, off the I95 in Philly. The speculation is, they announced the conference without actually checking with the Four Seasons Hotel, the hotel shot them down, so they found *a* Four Seasons for their press conference.\n\n[The jokes pretty much wrote themselves.](https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/1325132671140327427)",

It's idiots all the way down. \n\nThere is no endgame, just a fragile narcissist nearing the end of his rope, and the sycophants in his orbit trying to protect him. He's spent his whole life eating away at the lead his dad left him and now the grift is almost up and as we see his \"allies\" abandon him over the next 60 days, the reality that he's probably in legal and financial trouble are going to set in. His kids are probably so involved because they realize pops isn't leaving them nearly as much as they thought.",

By having it then parroted by pro-Trump news hosts on local radio networks and national news networks such as Fox (and also OANN and Breitbart), for his supporters you create the illusion that such acts actually occurred, without having any proof to do so. (They have videos and anecdotes and such which are \"proof\" which may later be debunked, but people have already been convinced, so it doesn't matter.) And because the \"fact\" fraud \"actually occurred\" is \"beyond doubt,\" you can then discredit the institutions that go against Trump as part of a deep state plot. Then you can do what you want.\n\nThis has been what he has done since Day 1 vs traditional media or the \"Mainstream Media.\" By creating \"alternative\" narratives and having them being parroted by Hannity et al (note this has been going on since before Trump, they just didn't have a figure they could coalesce around) they eroded trust in the press (partly this is also the press' fault to some degree) and then they could continue spouting falsehoods and lies whenever convenient for them because traditional fact-checking had lost all authority.\n\nNot saying he's going to be able to be as successful vs the courts but he's going to shake their, and Biden's, legitimacy.",

What are the Republicans saying happened? And why didn\u2019t it work in 2016?\n\nEdit to add: And if you send in millions of fraudulent ballots, where do you send them from? If you send them from the same post office, wouldn\u2019t they notice a few million extra pieces of mail coming from the same exact post office, which would be overwhelmed with extra work and at least a few GOP postal workers who would notice? Or did they manage to distribute them equally across the country to hundreds of different Democratic conspirators who mailed them in locally?\n\nEdit: Trump tweeted that he got 71 million legit votes, the most *legal* votes in US history. So that means that Biden and the Libs sent in at least 4 million fake votes and *evenly* distributed them somehow to all counties across the nation and somehow didn\u2019t duplicate mail-in ballots that were from legit Democratic voters.",

Intentional voter fraud is extremely rare, let alone enough to change the outcome of an election. Voter fraud is a serious issue, and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. That being said, you want to know who committed voter fraud? Donald Trump. He votes by mail as a \u201cresident\u201d of Florida. His Mar-A-Lago resort is his supposed residence. However, it\u2019s listed as a private club, and not a residence. He is not a legal resident of Florida, and intentionally votes in Florida. Donald Trump is one of the few cases of voter fraud. FYI",

It's been such a long standing rule that even George Washington's portrait in the house was painted without his sword. The members of congress pulling this shit are childish.\n\nEdit: Apparently this became an issue again in 2018 (after I left the hill). Decent read/history from [the washington post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-look-to-roll-back-little-known-rule-allowing-guns-in-the-capitol/2018/12/05/85966172-f71f-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html) if anyone was interested",

He struck Charles Sumner before he could even stand from his chair then proceeded to beat him to the brink of death while his goons stood by and threated to shoot anyone who intervened.  He was also extremely pro-slavery.\n\nIf there is any consolation he died only 8 months after the attack at age 37 from unexpectedly from a violent bout of croup.  The official telegram announcing his death stated \"He died a horrid death, and suffered intensely. He endeavored to tear his own throat open to get breath.\"",

Burlingame's speech led to Brooks issuing Burlingame with a challenge to a duel. Burlingame accepted, but **Brooks failed to turn up after being informed that Burlingame was an accomplished marksman**.",

She is beyond unqualified for her position and I'm perplexed as to how she could even get into this position.  In order to run she finally decided to get her GED after dropping out to raise her child at a young age (I applaud you young mom's, just not Lauren as her character is garbage). She has had multiple run ins with the law and has complete disregard for any kind of authority.  She refused to show up to any court hearings and there was a flyer sent around here in CO even showing those dates and convictions. She married a piece of shit pedo who exposed himself to several minors (there is irrefutable evidence of this and can be tracked down online) at the bowling alley in Rifle, CO.  Oh yeah...go eat at her restaurant and you'll for sure either catch Covid OR food poisoning as it's good at one thing - violations.",

And it hasn't been that good for the cops themselves either.\n\nUsing the Capitol police as an example, like you said, one week some of them are putting their lives on the line to protect Congress. Literally a week later they're getting berated, shoved, etc. just so some can take a political stance. \n\nDe-politicizing the police should go hand-in-hand with reforming the police. They're entitled absolutely to their own private political views.

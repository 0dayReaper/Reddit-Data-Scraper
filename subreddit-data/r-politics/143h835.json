They know their place as local politicans, and know it'd be dumb to run nationally.\n\nEDIT: apparently this ND fool just entered the race, lmao. Carry on, then.",

That did not satisfy Florida politicians. In 2003, the State Legislature passed a bill giving the governor, *Jeb Bush* at the time, the authority to prevent removal of the feeding tube. This legislation, later declared unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court, was called Terri\u2019s Law. (This is a common legislative tactic: identifying a bill by some unfortunate\u2019s name to enhance its emotional appeal. It is worth noting that first names and diminutives tend to be used when the person is a woman or a child.) Men are usually accorded greater dignity. Hence, we had the Brady Bill, a federal gun-control law named for James S. Brady, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s press secretary, who was shot in 1981. No one thought to call it Jim\u2019s Bill.) [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/us/from-private-ordeal-to-national-fight-the-case-of-terri-schiavo.html)\n\n&gt;The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of President George W. Bush, caused *a seven-year (1998 to 2005) delay* before Schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed.\n\nWhen the politics stops being about the people, but the politicians, and when every single member of the \"party of law and order\" chooses to ignore the law and the courts for a \"principled family-values stand\".\n\n&gt;The Schindlers insisted that the tube be kept in place. That, they said, is what their daughter would have wanted.",

(More so than it already was, Christianity in the US had much more diverse opinions than the current mainstream before this.)\n\nIt kind of implies to me that the root issue of the Republican platform has not actually changed since the southern strategy. Everything else is fluff designed to make people vote for people who will implement racist policies, and even after 50-60 years, and even though those issues have developed a life of their own, they are still subordinate to the original segregationist positions that birthed them.",

            "comment": "The Republicans are failing to realize just how fucked their party is.  In 2016, Trump bullied his way through a weak field to get the nomination.  At that point, a lot of independent voters ignored his eccentricities by believing in his ability as a businessman and not being a\" Washington insider\" and voted for him.  After that, they watched him burn down the nation for four years culminating in the Jan 6th insurrection.  After this incredibly bizarre time, no independents would ever vote for him again.  And they didn't in 2020.  Now, almost 3 years later, he has continued his election denial and is now facing the very real threat of felony convictions.  Not one person who is not a republican will ever vote for him again.\n\nMeanwhile, after his election, his casual racism and bold discrimination and bullying gave voice to the extreme sections of the party.  Moderate voices were drowned out and the radicals rallied to the Trump cult.  The party was bulldozed into submission to the demagogue.  Green, DeSantis and other extreme republicans took up his mantle and extolled the same hateful message.  Now the radicals are the face of the party.  And, it is turning off voters along all spectrums.  The republican image has been usurped.  It's no longer one that stands for fiscal responsibility and freedom from big government.  Now, most people see it as a party of hate and intrusion.  One that wants to control and dictate.  Moderates are walking away.  The leadership is in shambles.  They have alienated most of the country.  Unless they can find the moderate voice again and right this ship, their constituency will continue to shrink.  If all that is left is the radical element, they will cease to be relevant to the rest of the nation and will continue to lose elections in all but the most hardcore areas.  Nationally, they get crushed.  It's crisis time and they need moderate heads to get it back on track ASAP.",

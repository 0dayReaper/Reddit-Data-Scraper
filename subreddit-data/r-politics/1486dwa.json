My point is that if you pick jurors from West Palm Beach Florida and you instruct them to only return a guilty verdict if they are nearly 100% certain that Trump knowingly committed a crime there\u2019s a non zero chance that one Republican from that area is going to say, I\u2019m not convinced.\n\nEspecially when you factor in the likely Judge presiding over the trial is a demonstrated Trump supporter.",

Yeah even as a lawyer it would be tough and I\u2019ve empaneled lawyers three times (regrettably). I\u2019m hard headed.

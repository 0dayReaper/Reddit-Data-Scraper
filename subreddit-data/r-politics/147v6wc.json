Republicans took this opportunity and used politicians like Bernie sanders and aoc to paint a picture that democrats are socialist\u2026 and for most cubans all they gotta hear is the word \u201csocialism\u201d and you lost them. My family went from being fully democrat in 2008/2012 to me being the only one left voting democrat (its 6 of us). Do my family likes densatis? Nope\u2026 but they are voting against \u201csocialist democrats\u201d that will turn this country into another cuba\u2026",

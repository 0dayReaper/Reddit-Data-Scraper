Stuff like a public option or legalizing cannabis or school lunches, that's all moderate.  But at a federal level folks like Manchin or Lieberman get normalized for blocking popular reforms by corporate media.  Why was Lieberman called a \"moderate\" for blocking a public option that polled at 60% and instead supporting a tax mandate that polled at 30%?\n\nWhy is Manchin a \"moderate\" for raising taxes on 100 million Americans and their children but keeping massive tax cuts to global corporations with foreign investors?\n\nIt's the job of corporate media to reward folks like Manchin for siding with Republicans.",

Nobody ever stopped me from voting for the progressive candidate in a primary. Looks like nobody stopped the Minnesotans either.

Countless polls show progressive positions are overwhelmingly popular with Democratic voters. So no, your explanation doesn't check out.\n\nYour faith in the purity of the electoral system is inspiring, but everyone else recognizes the powerful role that money, corporate media bias, and a conservative party establishment have in primaries. One of the most common tactics for getting progressives to vote against their values is constant brainwashing about moderates being more electable.\n\nYour link shows that progressives in noncompetitive races lost seats that a corporate Democrat also would have lost. One of the gaslighting propaganda tactics corporate Dems love is to let progressives run in an noncompetitive seat everyone expects to lose anyway, and then use that as proof progressives can't win. That doesn't mean anything. There are plenty of examples to debunk your cherry-picking and confirmation bias.\n\n\u200b[Progressive candidates score crucial wins in midterm elections](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/09/democrats-progressive-candidates-races-wins-midterms-congress)\n\nReminder that the Congressional Progressive Caucus is still the largest Democratic caucus in Congress.",

How can they be overwhelmed by money? Why would someone who really cares about progressive policies vote for the less-progressive candidate just because they hear their name more? Has that ever happened to you?\n\n&gt;Your faith in the purity of the electoral system is inspiring\n\nAll I'm saying is that the candidate who gets the most votes wins. Are you saying that there's been electoral fraud?\n\n&gt;but everyone else recognizes the powerful role that money, corporate media bias, and a conservative party establishment have in primaries. \n\nYeah, because most people also recognize that progressive policies aren't as popular and motivating as the polls claim they are, because polls don't measure intensity of support very well. OR, if you're a progressive who can't accept that, you have to exist in this double-think zone where most voters desperately want progressive policies but are simultaniously very easily talked out of voting for them thanks to a few advertisements. \n\n&gt;Reminder that the Congressional Progressive Caucus is still the largest Democratic caucus in Congress.\n\nI thought progressives considered the Progressive Caucus to largely be a whitewashing sham? \n\nLook, the point is you can't have it both ways. Either progressive ideals are incredibly popular, or voters are ideologically flexible enough to be won over by a flashy marketing campaign from a moderate. Unless you're alleging massive continual voter fraud, these two ideas cannot exist simultaniously.",

They're completely incapable of winning in other way. They can't win on their own message because they have none. Their major donors force them to take positions wildly unpopular with most voters, and so, they run boring biography campaigns about nothing. Consequently, most of those corporate candidates lose in the next election when they're not boosted by a national wave.

The people who view 2010 the way you do are right wingers and moderates who pretend they are not right wingers. Democrats\u2019 major failing over the last half century has been to not focus on state and local party infrastructure the way Republicans have. In addition, race was very clearly a motivator to those right wingers. This clearly mobilized their base. (They tried to get this same energy last midterm with trans hate.) The moderate wing at the time, also had a bit of an issue with Obama starting with a contentious Clinton v. Obama primary. You can look up Clinton voters who actually decided to side with Republicans if you would like.\n\nIn opposition to your elementary analysis I present that, despite some instincts from him that I don\u2019t care for, Biden\u2019s administration has been considerably more progressive in multiple areas than Obama\u2019s.

This clearly mobilized their base.\n\nAnd it motivated the moderate suburban white voters who are basically \"the pendulum\" that determines national electoral outcomes.\n\n&gt;The moderate wing at the time, also had a bit of an issue with Obama starting with a contentious Clinton v. Obama primary. You can look up Clinton voters who actually decided to side with Republicans if you would like.\n\nIt wasn't particularly contentious. The \"PUMA\" thing lasted about two weeks and Obama absolutely crushed McCain with massive turnout from moderates. \n\n&gt;In opposition to your elementary analysis I present that, despite some instincts from him that I don\u2019t care for, Biden\u2019s administration has been considerably more progressive in multiple areas than Obama\u2019s.\n\nIt has been. The center of the party has been continually shifting left since the Bush era. \n\n&gt;Yet the mid term was not the monumental loss we saw in 2010.\n\nThis was mostly due to justified Trump-fear but also because Biden didn't do anything that could be as easily smeared as \"socialism\" as the ACA was.",

Local and state party infrastructure failures are far more responsible. It does not have to have anything to do with policy. Just because you say something X is the reason B happened, my refutation (which is backed up btw) does not have to be related to something x. It just has to explain B.\n\nI believe you when you say race motivated moderates, though I suspect we believe it motivated them differently.\n\nObama did win a bunch of moderates, but not as many as Clinton would have (Which kind of backs up my race comment a little.) as it is estimated 10% of her base either did not vote or voted for McCain.\n\nThe ACA was labeled as socialism by moderates and Republicans, sure, but Biden\u2019s administration has been mostly pro labor in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in decades from decades from democrat administrations. He is called a socialist/communist just as often as Obama ever was. He is also considered to have stolen the election by a considerable amount of people. Despite that, the mid terms were fine.\n\nYou point to progressivism as being the culprit of 2010, but you have nothing to back that up and recent history disproves your thesis.",

It's a narrative that corporate media pundits and the conservative party establishment maintain with confirmation bias.\n\nMost of the people who voted against McGovern are dead. That is such a zombie argument that needed to die so long ago. There are many other reasons he lost, including the conservative wing of the party actively sabotaging him. \n\nAnd Democrats have had someone run on a progressive platform more recently: Obama '08, which was the biggest Dem victory since LBJ ran on the progressive Great Society programs. Also note that Biden's efforts to reach Republican crossover voters was a complete failure. Trump increased his share of the Republican vote and his total voters. Modern elections are won by turnout, not appeals to swing voters, as Obama and Hillary so clearly demonstrated.",

Thus the members who did make up the legislature were more on board with sweeping laws for a variety of reasons.\n\nYou posted the article which is a great read, I'm not sure why you decided to reduce all the detail to 'huh they just stopped being lazy'.",

The Democratic party in Minnesota is known as the DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, a merge which happened some 80-100 years ago), which was much more pro-labor and *arguably* socialist. Floyd B. Olson, who was governor in the 1930s was part of said Farmer-Labor party and considered one of the best Minnesota governors. There are statues of him and a highway named after him. There were labor riots here in the 1930s, that many even within the state do not know - as it's not taught.\n\nA left-wing bias is interwoven in much of Minnesota culture. Perhaps, this mindset is due to the large population with a Scandinavian background, and those values persist through the generations. We have our MAGA types too, but not as loud or widespread as elsewhere in the country. Our Republican party is pretty pathetic.",

Ultimately, MN has been relatively well-governed and did not suffer rustbelt effects like wisconsin. the material realities seem more likely than some special \"scandinavianess\"",

When it comes to demographic differences, Wisconsin is heavily influenced by its German immigrant population, and Minnesota is heavily by its Scandinavian. Recently, unfortunate people have become politicians in Wisconsin, and that has set the state down an unfortunate path. After 9/11 or so, Wisconsin shifted right, but Minnesota did not - with the exception of Tim Pawlenty - who was the last Republican to win a statewide election - in 2008.\n\nMilwaukee had socialist mayors - there is a definite left-wing influence in Wisconsin. It, unfortunately, for those who are left-wing, is not part of the current Wisconsin political culture. Minnesota's past left-wing culture has survived, somewhat, largely (IMHO) due to the very fact that the Minnesota Democratic party is itself, left of the national DNC.",

He's kept it quiet, shrugged off the drama, did his job, and he's been a relatively good representative. I would love to have had more \"tax the rich\" policies and a bit more aggressive student debt cancelation, but all in all he's done well. Obama pulled some rather large controversial moves in his 2 terms but Biden hasn't so much yet.\n\nI rather wish he would just step down and endorse our next best candidate, but I'd most definitely vote for him again if there is not another democratic contender.  \n\n\nEdit:  \n\n\nJust to add, other notable things he's done is make a good push to jumpstart industry (and it's working), supporting Ukraine, and his administration is staying on top of technological advances instead of reacting to them as they develop (EVs, AI, etc).   \n\n\nI would really love to see someone push for a military budget audit.

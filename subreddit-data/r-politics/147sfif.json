Toxic gerrymandering, ballot box intimidation with fucking guns, cheating at the polls, gish-gallop glossolalia with no actual content. Intense self-incriminating projection just continually spewed on Fox, Breitbart, RT etc\n\nIt's Republicans doing all of that, contrary to Fox propaganda. They spend a lot of time lately pretending that Trump could declassify SCIF-grade documents on Iran/Russia/etc., when this is NOT the case. He cannot do that and even if he could there is a set process involved. Trump later admitted that he could not, in fact, declassify documents with his mind. He's been recorded admitting that. Still Jim Jordan is propping him up like a deflated pillow\n\nYou want Donald Trump to be crowned King of the US, have no term limits and be able to run for president from prison. That's 80% of registered GOP voters in a poll from earlier, because they know that if he runs for president while imprisoned, that's his last gasp before the door slams shut on him and all his kakistocratic fascism.\n\nAlso, it's curious to me that all of you seem to be equating the mishandling of official e-mails to what amounts to stealing thousands upon thousands of classified documents and US government secrets. To put that into perspective: If you, as a regular citizen, had done just a minute fraction of that; you would have been disappeared never to be heard from again. Period. No arraignment, no trial, no identity, no nothing.\n\nPS: Apparently, the minimum sentence for Trump if found guilty on all 37 charges is around 400 years in prison. Well deserved. I cannot think of a more comprehensively repugnant politician and I've been around for 50 years at this point and have seen a whole bunch of shit people in politics. He's not really a politician though, just like most of the GQP now. Have you seen his all-caps messages on Truth Social? Do they make you proud of your country? Yeah? Haha xD",

We're potentially talking about a President that from his actions could have ended up leaking national secrets, selling national secrets, trading them. People want to just wave off his actions as foolishness, but there's a long record of his buffoonery turning towards crime.\n\nHaving someone deal with their own appointed judge that then examines their criminality is frankly total bullshit. It shouldn't be about \"well the judge *might* feel pressure to rule fairly\"... Hell no. They shouldn't be in a spot where there's a HUGE conflict of interest possible.",

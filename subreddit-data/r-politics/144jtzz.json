Does the AI get smart and directly trigger WWIII or is it through the people's use of advanced, but not self aware AI to deceive and manipulate each other around false yet make-believable conflicts? Advanced AI in either case is the catalyst whether it's self aware or not.  People abusing AI tech in CONbination with our own sense of self preservation results in that trigger being pulled rather than the computer AI becoming self aware and doing it directly.   What I am saying:  The AI doesn't need to become self aware or have direct access to war materials when the people using the in control over our media/government/military forces can fill that 'self aware' role without the AI needing to 'develop' that characteristic.",

The danger from AI was never that some self aware AI would turn our own nuclear weapons against us and try to conquer the survivors with an army of terminators, like in the movies.  The real danger is that some idiot politician or general will  use unaware AI to manufacture false information so convincing that it starts a war that ends with humans nuking ourselves out of existence.",

They lost something like 30% of their operating budget and were told to figure it out. LSU didn't seem to feel the same hardships, it seemed. It was looking like I may not even be able to schedule some basic science shit like organic chemistry or physics during the next couple of semesters while they figured out how to keep the place open. I transferred to a private school because I was worried about budget problems getting in the way.   That's all i really remember about him is how he tried to strangle public education in a state that could really use some basic investment.",

Religion is dominating every aspect in this fycking state. Separation of church and state doesn't not exist in Louisiana. \n\n1 example is the jungle primaries from last year. Our DPEC wouldn't endorse 1 candidate. It was a shit show. We need a new generation in our dpec to make any difference.",

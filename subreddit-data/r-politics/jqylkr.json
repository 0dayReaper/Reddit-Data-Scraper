There is only water and no water. The population of people has fallen alongside with most great nations. The only sovereign nation that remains is oceania and Greenland. The wealthiest of people have all retreated away from the anarchy to antarctica in massive underground bunkers that elon musk built in 2018. Every day consists of rummaging through city after city after city in hopes of food and water, clothes, tools, batteries, baby wipes, and gasoline.\n\n\nEdit: I feel like I shouldn't have to explain this but since y'all keep saying something lol. \n\nI know there wouldn't be any celebrities in a world like this.

For example, in the state of Illinois, current regulations allow providers to store vaccines in regular refrigerators (it also requires temperature monitoring).  Pretty much every common vaccine can be stored safely at temperatures a common refrigerator/freezer can maintain and a regular refrigerator is about 1/3 - 1/4 the cost of a medical grade refrigerator and lots of offices do not have these.  This will delay distribution even further.",

Normally, I would say that there is nothing wrong with wanting to advance in your career.  But this guy is a whole different animal.  When he took over as governor of Indiana, he was gift-wrapped a booming state economy and very low unemployment.  So what was the first thing he did?  He asked the church and RNC what policies he should enact.  He handled the HIV outbreak here the exact same way he handled the COVID-19 \"taskforce\"...\n\n1. Ignore the advice of experts.\n2. Do nothing.\n3. Try to pray it away.\n4. Change course and half-heartedly follow what health experts told him to do from the get-go.\n5. Watch everything spiral.\n\nAlso take a look at how his Religious Freedom Restoration Act did here.  He was willing to risk having almost all big conferences (like Comic-Con) refuse to return.  Believe it or not, Indianapolis is one of the leading cities in the country in hosting major conferences...it's a big deal.  Also, many large corporations threatened to leave.  Pence did this, and doubled-down on it, just to allow a pizza place refuse to serve gay people.  \n\nTLDR: Mike Pence does not give a shit about anyone other than those who can further his career.",

And the fact that so many people split their tickets, still voting for the GOP that enabled him every step of the way in the House and Senate, even if they did pull for Biden, shows how so, so, so many people don't get that this problem isn't going to go away unless its addressed more fundamentally. There will be another Trump who tries to run in 2024 or 2028, how successful they are will be a different question, but the reality is, those people that voted for him haven't gone away, and neither have those politicians who supported him. If the next Trump is smarter, more competent, and capable of keeping his dog-whistles just a *little* bit out of the hearing range of the general public, America will be in for a very, very scary time.",

Its sad but so many people on both sides just think the other side is actively trying to ruin the country. We need to stop voting for just and R and D and actually educate ourselves and vote for candidates who want to implement policy we want. \n\nBiden was far from my first choice for candidate but even if you read from sources varying views it seems super obvious that Biden is the clear choice. Whenever I look for news I try to look on NPR/AP, FOX, as well as trying to just simply google information for myself just to get a good diversity of thought (FOX is nonsensical most of the time but they are the main right wing media). That just isn't something a huge majority of America do.\n\nIts crazy too cause it seems both sides feel like they're being lied to by the other but the most people will do to educate themselves is read opinions of people that agree with them. \n\nOne of the reasons I'm optimistic about Biden is that during the debate he admitted that the 1994 crime bill was a mistake. Politics is hard when people can't admit they're wrong and have biases.",

I wish more people saw that the country needs some maintenance too, stripping away functioning wheels of the government and ignoring those squeaky ones is going to lead to a catastrophic failure that will cost much more in the end.",

Think about it, common sense and folk wisdom are actually byproducts of how you are raised, and the culture you exist in as an adult. What they *are not* is positions you arrive at through careful study and logical reasoning.\n\nThis lack of respect for intellectualism is what makes the right so good at inculcating people who aren't used to thinking about things im a structured manner. It is incredibly easy to trick someone who isn't used to being lied to by institutions they trust virtually implicitly (their pastors, Fox News, the politicians their whole family voted for, etc).",

If Biden makes good on his promise to govern for all people, it may not be the dramatic shift to the left that people want but it could be enough that it shows Republicans that democrats aren't out to get them, at the very least. Unfortunately, the US isn't going to change overnight, or even in one presidential term. There needs to be a deprogramming of the fear mongering that has been so prevalent in the last 50 years.",

Keeping people scared and desperate probably also played into Moscow Mitch denying any financial assistance getting through the Senate. Hopefully the Dems really start messaging that should they regain the senate that they would quickly pass the stalled assistance legislation that Moscow Mitch has sitting on his desk.\n\nedit: spelling",

It's a genuinely worrying thought that this election was so close that in 4 years nothing is certain. Not least I think because I'd be surprised if Biden seems at the level he is now in 4 years and no one will want him to run again.",

Was the report about the congreswoman's panic button being removed confirmed?\n\nThe president specifically not mobilizing defense, then using rhetoric to inflame a mob, then a few guys who knew what they were doing plotted to use the mob to get inside.  Convinced it was their last chance, they planned on violently interrupting the count and hoping to be able to say that means constitutionally there never was a true outcome to the election.  And from there they fantasized on a seizure of power mirroring history's coups.",

They were on American soil and did it basically for the amusement of their superiors. The protestors had every right to be there and should have been afforded the same protections they would be granted anywhere else in this country. It went almost entirely without response, despite some being severely injured. Plus, the thugs were armed! It could have been a significant diplomatic incident if a protestor had tried to defend themselves more forcefully.\n\nIt doesn't rank even in the top 10 horrible things that Trump did or didn't do while in office, but it just irks me to no end. It sent a clear message to Turkey, and to every other country in the world, that you could walk all over Trump. He wasn't going to speak up or stop you. Want to murder a journalist? Go ahead. Want to poison an opposition leader? Feel free! You won't get so much as a slap on the wrist and a stern talking to. \n\nTo paraphrase Trump himself, \"When you're Turkish, they just let you do it.\"",

Just look at the past 4 years of concentration camps, dehumanizing immigrants, and straight up nazi slogans.\n\nThey oppose the anti-fascist movement because they side with the people antifa fights. I've sadly learned that much of my family totally supports fascism so long as it aligns with their fundamentalists Christian worldview. God is the ultimate authority, they choose to believe Trump is sent from god to be their dear leader, therefor anything he does is ultimately good and must be defended.\n\nI live in Trump Country, where the terrorists who invaded DC have open supporters. It's scary knowing that half the adults around me would lynch me if they thought it would keep Trump in power.\n\n\nI grew up wondering how anyone could ever support the Nazis, let alone an entire country. Now my own family has entered a cult of personality and supports concentration camps and the murder of innocent politicians. All Trump had to do was pander to them and dangle the promise of material wealth and power in front of them and now anyone who doesn't agree with them supports baby murder and the eating of children.",

So when you arrest someone you very rarely ever get to build a strong case against them when you have them detained, unless the suspect willingly or unwillingly fucks up. \n\nUsually when you're being investigated, you don't know how big of a file they've built up on you, what they're monitoring, and what they have against you, or when they've even been watching you. I had a co-worker that was investigated and arrested for insider trading years ago. They had a file on me and several other of my co-workers simply by association. They didn't have anything incriminating against us, but what our attorney told me was they had enough to verify if we collaborated with the guy they wanted, and if you were dumb enough to shoot yourself in your own foot even though they had nothing against you. For me it was only a couple of emails. \n\nWhile a lot of people probably do slip through the cracks, I really hope this investigation is through. I don't want to make this seem like some CSI shit because a lot of time investigators don't really have shit to proceed, but in this case you'd hope they can build a large profile of incriminating evidence against these people, and hit them when they're most vulnerable.",

Then he\u2019d claim he can\u2019t leave office until the emergency is over because there\u2019s no line of succession and the election was rigged. \n\nI don\u2019t know actually. Just come up with dumbest, most self serving thing you can think of and that\u2019s probably right.",

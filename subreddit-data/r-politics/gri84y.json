He ripped chunks of (ex-)wife's hair out and raped her just because she suggested a doctor that performed scalp reduction surgery (a barbaric and exceedingly painful procedure) when he freaked out in the 1980's over a minor regression of his hairline.\n\nEdit: The procedure Trump undertook, according to Ivanka, was called the Fleming/Mayer Flap, where a piece of the scalp is found with hair on and then it is cut on three sides to create said flap. This sliver of skin is then twisted, pulled and forced into a new position on the hairline where the faulty follicles are.\n\nYou are basically stretching the hairy part of your scalp over to the parts that have no hair.",

It would be more like if Trump's reaction to your sign was to let you continue to hold the sign, and send someone with another sign that said \"Find out more about this claim.\" That person then handed out pamphlets arguing against the claim.\n\nTrump is basically saying that would be violating your free speech and Mar-a-lago would deserve to be shut down if they didn't stop.",

Many conservative voters believe that if you value hard work then \u201cof course\u201d you would vote red. There are truly a plethora of right wing voters who believe that democrats do not work for a living and that \u201cworking\u201d is for republicans. Obviously that is an *asinine* assumption, but the fact is the propaganda pushes that out. For some republicans, this is truly the number one reason they vote red, because they believe that myth.\n\n\u201cMasculinity\u201d is also such a major part of the republican party in terms of the voting base. For some reason, many people view him as this \u201cmasculine alpha male\u201d which is really quite comical.\n\nUltimately it doesn\u2019t matter what Trump says or does (unless he starts capitulating to democrats).

Americans had had over 20 years of her on the political scene. Those who hated her loathed her, many having done so for years; these people could be found mostly on the right but across the political spectrum. Of those who liked her, relatively few loved her. She was an effective bureaucrat, is very smart, and would have made at least as good a President as Obama.\n\nFinally, Russia put a decisive thumb on the scale, to which we do not know the full extent.",

What those people lack isn\u2019t intelligence, but the ability to put themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes. \n\nAs an example, It\u2019s much easier to be xenophobic and villainize illegal immigrants than it is to think about why they\u2019re coming here - they just want a better life for them or their families. All the people who want to get rid of DACA don\u2019t realize that for a lot of these kids the US is just as much their home as someone born here. If you\u2019re brought here when you\u2019re little it\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever know just like a citizen.\n\nThe same logic can be stretched to many other issues like welfare or abortion.

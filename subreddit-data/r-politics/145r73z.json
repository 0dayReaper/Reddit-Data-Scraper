It shows how deeply the white MAGA crowd feels there is no circumstance that *THEY* could be found guilty of a crime. For them crime is something that bad people do (read minorities, people of color, immigrants). They can't be held accountable because they are good people and if they were then saying sorry and feeling guilty should be enough punishment.",

They determine if the person's actions are good or bad based on a set of principles, and that informs the conclusion about whether they are a good or bad person.\n\nA right-leaning person does the opposite.

It does not matter what you do, the only thing that determines if you are good or bad is who you are, i.e. your status in society, which group you belong to, your place in the hierarchy. And that is the sordid heart of identity politics: The conservatives with wealth and power are at the top of the hierarchy -as what is essentially today\u2019s aristocracy- because they are inherently good. Clearly their place at the top is their (either naturally occurring or divinely-ordained) reward. And conversely, the working class and the poor are in their positions because they are inherently bad, and they must be punished for it. With one exception in those who are lower on the ladder but who still support that hierarchy, and defend the aristocracy at the top. Those are tolerated, and they are also encouraged to oppress and punish whoever is further below them in the hierarchy. That cruelty is the point in itself; punish those who are inherently bad.",

The problem is, he prefers that outcome to the alternative, which for him means getting replaced as the leader of the Republicans/MAGAs/etc, and probably getting thrown right under the bus to rot in prison (among other things).

With a conviction in the Georgia case Trump could be stricken from the ballot in 2024 (or forever, not sure), but it\u2019s not clear if the federal case would be completed before the 2024 election. Now, my question here is not about state/national qualifications to run but rather a parties rules of who they choose to nominate. I remember questions as such going into the 2016 RNC convention on whether Trump was going to given the nomination or not. That lead me to believe that RNC leadership could ignore the votes cast for a nominee and pick their own to represent the Party. It looks as if these cases against Trump will be running concurrent with the primary season of 2024. Now, we have seen a surge in polling supporting Trump by republicans when he gets indicted so will that hold as the cases are publicly reported? As a result, he obtains the votes to be nominated. Will and can the RNC step in and choose someone else? It won\u2019t prevent Trump from running (he can claim an Independent) but it will prevent him from being elected. Sure, it also would prevent Republicans from winning but at this point in the race RNC leadership might be hard pressed by their donors to cut bait, suck up a lose and hope that conservative Democrats in Congress will vote to prevent major shifts in economic policy. I just don\u2019t see Trump disappearing (he needs the money) and I don\u2019t see the media shifting their Trump exposure (they need the money) so we\u2019re stuck with this hype moving forward. The political/elite class in this country has realized this and is trying to make a change of course w/o upsetting the economic status quo is what I can gather. Just prevent Trump from winning because if he does it would be a disaster for everyone and that includes the donors.",

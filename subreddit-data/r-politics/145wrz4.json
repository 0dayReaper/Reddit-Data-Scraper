Just straight up admitting information is secret and telling people with no security clearance to look at it. *While knowingly being recorded.*\n\nThis kinda shit would be too ridiculous for an Austin Powers movie.",

There is no allegation in the indictment that sensitive secured information was shared with any foreign national, let alone a citizen from an enemy combatant country.  Being utterly reckless in your handling and storing of such information is not unique. Rarely, under such circumstances, does it result in a criminal indictment as opposed to civil penalties and losing your security clearance.  What is overwhelming in the indictment is the obstruction story. That\u2019s where the danger lies for Trump (if the facts stay status quo).",

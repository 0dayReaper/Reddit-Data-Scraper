I don't care if you believe Russia should in fact be a key ally and there is genuinely nothing wrong with sharing this information with them.\n\nTHIS RIGHT FUCKING HERE:\n\n&gt;U.S. officials said that the National Security Council continues to prepare multi-page briefings for Trump to guide him through conversations with foreign leaders **but that he has insisted that the guidance be distilled to a single page of bullet points, and often ignores those.**\n\nIf you can't see the problem here and why this *child* is unfit to be leader of the most powerful country on Earth, there's something deeply wrong with you. It is abundantly clear that he is just not an intelligent person. Not even close. Daddy gave him everything so he's gotten to be rich his whole life, but he's a fucking imbecile. **HE CAN'T READ MORE THAN ONE PAGE OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD.** ",

He has yet to receive punishment. Decency? Honesty? The Constitution? Nothing matters anymore. US politics has become *trivial*, a game of pure partisan savagery where scoring points for your team and bending the rules to your benefits are all that matters. The greater good? Forget about it. Politics has become the Hunger Games.",

We will be more exposed to danger.

[Buzzfeed is reporting](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/trump-highly-classified-information-russians?utm_term=.eqjRDGWEJV#.wkpJ5vRN7G):\n\n&gt;Two US officials who were briefed on Trump\u2019s disclosures last week confirmed to BuzzFeed News the veracity of the Post report, with one official noting that \u201cit\u2019s far worse than what has already been reported.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind. Russian press was invited. American press was excluded. They probably had audio/video of this for a week over in the Kremlin. Our \"free\" press was kept in the dark until these leaks to WaPo.\n\nOk, one last edit - for the people telling me the WH/McMaster have denied and claimed it is false. McMaster just gave a 60 second press conference, denied sharing \"sources and methods,\" and left without taking any questions. WaPo didn't claim he gave \"sources and methods,\" it reported that he gave them the actual classified underlying Intel. Many IC commentators making their rounds on the news have been saying that with this information, Russia could easily determine their sources and methods.",

Specifically, the PRA allows for public access to Presidential records through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) beginning five years after the end of the Administration, but allows the President to invoke as many as six specific restrictions to public access for up to twelve years. The PRA also establishes procedures for Congress, courts, and subsequent administrations to obtain special access to records that remain closed to the public, following a 30\u2011day notice period to the former and current Presidents.",

Residency match is kinda like the NFL draft so you\u2019re contractually obligated to go wherever you match. And you apply for residencies a year in advance, so when I applied last year to some residency programs in Florida, it hadn\u2019t yet become the fascist hellscape it is currently (although it was clearly flirting with it). At this point, I\u2019ve got no choice but to go since no residency equals no practicing medicine.",

Also didn't that stat also use adults 18-19? And rely on the 2-3 years of the pandemic era? \n\n&gt;every other cause you mentioned has guidelines in place reduce the associated risks. \n\nYeah, most of those are passive and unobtrusive and still kill more kids than school shootings have. Like all they did was slap a warning label on buckets as part of the \"huge\" effort to reduce drownings of children and optional classes to take your kids to learn how to swim. \n\n&gt; Even cars\u2026 you can\u2019t take a car away from someone but you can enforce safety laws (seatbelts, speed limits, mandated license renewal, etc.).\n\nAnd still kill thousands by accident and with much greater frequency than school shootings. And most of those are just traffic violations that result in simple fines and licensing is only for access to public roads not a requirement to own or even purchase a car. \n\n&gt;How easy is it to obtain a drivers license compared to purchasing a weapon?\n\nFairly easy as I know of only a few crimes that actually can block you from getting a license. Past due child support and DUIs. And most of the country just keeps reupping your license without follow up training if it doesn't already have some ridiculous expiration date that goes decades into the future(showing how seriously we take deaths child or otherwise when it comes to cars).",

Imagine if the police could bust your door down whenever they wanted and search your house for contraband.\n\nGun control is unconstitutional.",

It's the desperate who see no other way out. Neither party cares because we need decades long solutions which doesn't work foe two year voting cycles.",

To say nothing of them accepting money ~~bribes~~ from all of their corporate sponsors which help preserve the status quo.

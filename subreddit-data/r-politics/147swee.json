I canvassed for a candidate in Texas a few years back and all I had to do was show up to an event and I got access to home addresses for all party members in the area (750k+ addresses). I didn't have to sign anything. As a data engineer, I was appalled at the lack of security.\n\nAs the rhetoric continues to ramp up and the party divide deepens, that data is going to become a major liability.",

If you know someone\u2019s first and last name and the city they live in you can probably find their registration and home address within about 5 min on google. I know people who stay registered as independent just for this reason. I did too, but I changed to democrat a couple years ago bc I wanted to vote in the primaries. \n\nYou can remove this info, or at least make it a little harder to find. Google a few variations of your name and address to find all the third party sites that post it. On those sites, find the page to have your info removed and submit the request. Back on google, click the 3 dots on each result and select \u201cremove result\u201d (might need a google account, you cannot just do this step, you MUST remove the record on the website or google will just find it again). Repeat google checks every couple days to see if they all go away and find any you missed. There\u2019s probably still a way to find it if someone really wanted to, but at least it\u2019s not a 2 minute google search.",

Cameras everywhere. Biometric scanning. We carry around a computer that is tracking your movement, what social media apps you use, media you ingest or put out, again what purchases you make, the assistants await your commands while taking in everything said and crunch it (easiest way to test this? Talk out loud within earshot of a smart speaker about something you need or want, talk about it in length. Don\u2019t google or search for it anywhere else, and notice in about a day to a week you start seeing targeted advertising\u2026), the texts we send to the calls we make. All mineable, all just more data points to consolidate, collate, and disseminate. So kind of very George Carlin esk I embrace this loss of anonymity. Sorry had this bit stored up for awhile\u2026",

And the Republican Party ALSO has people who have no problem with an Authoritarian Dictator like Trump having near total control to enforce oppressive laws so long as those laws don't appear harmful to themselves personally. \n\nIt's a dichotomy of the highest order, and they both vote for the same party, the party somehow manages to push both messages effectively. \n\nAnd your example about the democrats is kind of the same. \"Centrist Democrats\" are still trying to be fiscally conservative in economic policies, and consider themselves culturally liberal; except they brought us the Defense of Marriage Act and the Don't Ask Don't Tell ban on being openly gay in the military. Meanwhile these same Democrats are finding themselves working alongside AoC and Bernie Sanders who are not fiscally conservative; they're asking why we don't just forgive student loans and tax the corporations more alongside their pro LGBT+ track record.\n\nIt's not so much as a \"both sides\" thing in that I think it's pretty clear that if you favour the Republicans you're both okay with the end of democracy or the suffering of minorities for the sake of your own personal benefit. \n\nBut it's a \"both sides\" thing in the sense that both sides are a mess of opinions across their elected representatives and its so easy to point out hypocrisy because when there's only 2 sides there isn't really a chance to hold a nuanced opinion.",

From this article: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/01/railroad-workers-union-win-sick-leave\n\n&gt; But the unions representing workers who operate the trains day to day, such as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, have had far less success reaching agreement on paid sick days. \u201cThe railroads went to the non-operating crafts first and cut a deal with them,\u201d said Mark Wallace, first vice-president of the Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. \u201cIf a carman [who inspects and repairs railcars] has to call in sick and doesn\u2019t come to work, the train will still run. If the engineer or conductor has to call in sick, the train is probably not going to go that day.\u201d\n\nSome of the workers have been taken care of, but not all. There's nothing inconvenient I'm leaving out here, and this is the main problem. When you remove the opportunity to negotiate a sweeping change like this, you give companies the ability to do the bare minimum so they can turn around and proclaim how much they care while continuing to screw other people over. It could have been dealt with at the Federal level but it wasn't. And as we saw in this case and the debt ceiling deal, part of negotiation means throwing marginalized people (like those on food stamps) under the bus.",

Then in the general election we both vote D anyway unless its an NPA candidate in a local race that makes better sense. For instance, Im not a fan of Daniel Webster but Laura Loomer scared me, we didn't need a MTG or Florida Boebert, we have bad enough GOP ppl as it is.",

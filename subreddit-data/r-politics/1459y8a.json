It takes a 2/3 majority in the senate to remove a judge.  Unless the fbi has evidence of a bribe she isn\u2019t going anywhere.  The next Republican president will reward here with a promotion.   \n\nIt\u2019s insane.\n\nEdit: just came across this link which says the 11th circuit can force her to recuse.   After the scathing ruling by the 11th circuit I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll not let her preside over the case.  \n\nhttps://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1667166126881619969",

Her earlier actions were countered by the appellate court above hers, if I recall correctly.  And if you read the article, it is likely the appellate court would strike down anything particularly biased she does involving the case, and/or she would be asked to recuse herself by the prosecutors and her recusal would likely be granted.",

Her last ruling was struck down, unanimously by a Federal Appeals Court. She is already on the shit list and if she wants to play favorites, that shit won\u2019t fly. \n\nShe should dismiss herself from this case, but if she doesn\u2019t, every step she takes will be scrutinized due to pass precedent.",

Remember she was rebuked unanimously by the appeals court panel of judges\u2026 Her assignment of this docket totally looks like a set up.",

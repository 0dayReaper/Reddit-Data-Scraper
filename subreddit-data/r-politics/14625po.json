He didn't care about (or even understand) most policy and just promoted and signed whatever the R's put on his desk. And then the media would label it \"Trump \\[policy\\]\". His policy agenda (to the degree that it existed) for congress was never what made Trump uniquely dangerous as a political figure, and it's never what Romney and other anti-Trump R's claimed to have an issue with. So it's just silly to measure Romney's alignment to Trump by what positions Trump defaulted to on Senate votes.",

Their major sin is turning a blind eye to all the corruption Trump and his cronies did. But they never cared about corruption done by their own side anyway.\n\nTrump didn't and doesn't care about real policies. He has no desire to govern, just to enrich himself. So he has no real policy. Except for that stupid border wall. And even then it was all a grift.",

I think people forget just how much that photo op right before the 2012 election moved people towards Obama in what had looked like a decently close race. Mitt was painting himself as the centrist and conservative media was trying to paint Obama as this huge radical. The photo op killed that narrative along with the 47% comment. A huge part of Mitt\u2019s race was attempting to show people that Obama no longer wanted to be president, that he was burned out, and that Mitt \u201clooked\u201d more presidential whether that was a racist dog whistle or a criticism of Obama\u2019s ability to lead. Obama had a big presidential moment optically like a week or two before the election. \n\nPeople also forget that Trump didn\u2019t have any major endorsements early on and seemed like the same joke candidate he had been in previous primaries, then comes along one of the more popular and powerful republicans to throw a full throated support behind him, and then a lot of people followed.",

It was politically expedient for Christie to support him then, just as it\u2019s expedient for him to pretend to hate him now. \n\n\u201cChristie was one of the first top Republicans to back Trump in 2016 after the reality TV star emerged as the front-runner in the presidential race \u2014 and even helped the former president prepare to debate Joe Biden during the 2020 campaign.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2023/03/28/chris-christie-trump-support-2024",

That's not just campaign finance fuckery or even criminal conspiracy. As a result, the penalties, if convicted, are measured in decades in prison. The max of the max, 300+ yrs, would probably not happen. But the minimum of the minimum in the best possible sentencing outcome is still 3 years in prison. He's going to prison, if convicted.\n\n3. The political forces that are surrounding this are powerful. The money, the interested parties, for and against, all in the lead up to our 2024 election. The amount of ferocious tension that is building is serious for him but also for the country. I fear there will be violence.",

His approval rating hovered around 40% through two impeachments, it didn't matter what he did.   Biden's approval rating also hovers around 40%.     It doesn't matter what happens anymore, it is just if a person is red or blue.    It is all about which news sites a person pays attention to.  There is no objective reality, it is all subjective.  \n\nHe will delay the trial until after the election.    He will use the law to the fullest to make this thing take as long as possible, he only has to delay it about 18 months for it to not matter, and given that it has taken a 30 months from crime to indictment, and a 14 from grand jury to indictment it is reasonable to assume we are more than 18 months from conviction.  \n\nIf he does get convicted before the election, it might make some difference, but that is a big \"if\"   We can live in hope, but it is just a sliver.     He has very good attorneys who are well versed and practiced in delaying tactics.    He doesn't have to win, he just has to not lose for a time.\n\nIf he is convicted after the election and he does not win, it does not matter.  He is likely too old to run again in 2028.     There is little chance he can repeat these crimes if he loses the election.  \n\nIf he gets elected prior to conviction, his appointment for attorney general will have to continue the case.   If he is convicted while in office, there is little precedent for how sentencing might go.     There would be a lot of reluctance to jail a sitting president.  \n\nIt all hinges on if they can get a conviction before November next year.  Similar with the NY case.",

It could have been as simple as \"yup, I believe in rule of law and impartial justice... if Trump did X, he should face the consequences.\"\n\nThis... um... was done by very extremely few in the GOP.\n\nLegally, you can leave it to the courts.\n\nPolitically, long ago people should have **publicly** called on Trump to comply with these laws.  Rolling with Trump's nonsense during all of his tortured legal strategies dramatically undercut any legitimacy of these people.",

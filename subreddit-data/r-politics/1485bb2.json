You just need to rail against some make believe imaginary enemy loud enough to get people attention that you're loyal and you will be rewarded. There are a million examples but imagine a world where John Bolton's career wasn't over after the George W. Bush administration.",

It is an ideal however to aim for, as opposed to the conservative ideal, where political ideology trumps scientific fact or even achievement in a field and you get people like Rick Perry at the Energy Department replacing a nuclear physicist, and coal-lobbyists serving as the head of the EPA. The very nature of power doesn't preclude hiring competent or appropriate people, it's just authoritarianism values those qualities much less than loyalty.",

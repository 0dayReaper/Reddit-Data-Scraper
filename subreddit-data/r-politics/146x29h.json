He is taking advantage of the safeguards we still have to protect us, the average citizen, from being abused by the state. Creating easily accessible loopholes here would be a huge problem for individuals, especially those with sub-par representation. (Either from low pay or overwork.)\n\nThere needs to be a system to handle this, and technically there is one, but the bar to reach it is very high by design. Trump just had some moderately skilled lawyers for a long time, and the court have to give him some benefit of the doubt in court proceedings to maintain a fair system. (Bad people can be financially wronged too.) \n\nTrump has actually lost most of his legal battles. A significant portion of his misbehavior happens outside the courtroom entirely, and usually result in him quietly threatening people until the drop the case or him settling for undisclosed amounts and an NDA, which he then claims as a victory.\n\nThe big irony of his legal history is that he likely has spent WAY more money on this stuff than he has ever won from it. His weird habits with regard to his finances (not paying people, fighting over ridiculously small amounts of money, accepting tiny bribes) might be because he is constantly draining his liquid finances in these legal battles and other bad fiscal decisions.\n\nEven the case the other commentor linked, the 1973 housing lawsuit, Trump settled out of court for an undisclosed amount \"without admitting guilt\" and his counter suites were thrown out for \"not being worth the paper they were written on.\" He, of course, claimed this as a victory. Because he ALWAYS claims everything as a victory if he can.",

So now they\u2019re pulling more levers to speed up the process while still assuring that all his rights are protected.",

But if she is called out by her full circuit again she absolutely risks removal by impeachment, but again only after along string of wins.\n\nOn the other end, she can\u2019t save Trump single handedly. No matter she does Trump is still in enormous legal risk, plus 99% of the things she can do to help Trump improperly are reviewable by a higher Court who already don\u2019t like her bullshit.\n\nI\u2019m telling in the range of fascists outcomes, the most plausible is that this radical fascist does the most advantageous thing for herself.\n\nWe are right now at the early phases of the \u201cTrump consequences\u201d train. He has just started - literally for less than two months- started to get hit with his consequences from years of lawlessness. This train is going keep roaring for next 6-8 years minimum.\n\nBy the time it arrives at the station.. Trump will be represented by Jimmy McGill and will be complaining about the deep state to seven local fans.\n\nHonestly I understand why you are annoyed and hopeless but understand that the gears are turning very quickly and are about to mash up anyone who tries to stand in the way. \n\nThe fact that two really smart lawyers bailed is not surprising.",

Who knows how many other times he showed documents off, not to mention how they were left in insecure rooms.\n\nThese docs weren't meaningless. They aren't the president's daily schedule or what he ate or pictures of shaking hands. They are nuclear secrets, allied secrets, and adversary secrets. The sheer security risk is sooooo fucking huge that it's nearly incomprehensible.\n\nThe judiciary might try to throw the former president a bone or two, but they won't be able to do much because the entire administrative state is now fully against the largest security threat the US has ever faced. The DOJ, FBI, Homeland Security, Department of Energy, armed forces...basically every department/branch that handles classified materials knows he's a threat.\n\nSure the former president has evaded consequences before, but he's dead to rights on this one. Letting him go on a technicality or due to favoritism would destroy the US's credibility on the world stage.\n\nWill there still be some bullshit shenanigans? Absolutely. But this is not something that can be waived away casually. It's a big fucking deal.",

So he would still be sworn in from prison and could immediately pardon himself unless the House impeached him (again) and the Senate convicted him.",

I don\u2019t understand why he calls me that. He usually laughs when he mutters it. It doesn\u2019t make me feel good. So the con would go like this: I tell the butler that my Dad said I earned an extra cookie, and that  we should go to the chef and say we need 6 cookies - fresh chocolate chip - the big ones - you keep 2 and I\u2019ll keep 4. The butler was a diabetic, I found this out by sneaking into his medicine drawer in his quarters in the basement. He loved sugar. Me, I could take it or leave it, but I saw an opportunity, and I exploited the conditions, all set up by a few white lies that these employees of my family wouldn\u2019t question. At that point, I knew I was going to be successful, one way or another. \u201c",

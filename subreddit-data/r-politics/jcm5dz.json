There's still time to register in GA for the runoff even if someone wasn't registered for this election and the deadline is 12/7/2020. If someone turns 18 before January they can still register to vote for this election!\n\nhttps://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/welcome.do#no-back-button\n\nThe Fair Fight organization is headed by Stacey Abrams and could use our support.\n\nhttps://fairfight.com/",

Think of it this way, one of the things that got us in this mess was that Putin was extremely pissed because the Obama State Department led by Clinton put in place a series of sanctions that hit Putin's wallet personally, along with other oligarchs. \n\nIf Trump is over in Russia spouting off because Biden won, those sanctions will be restored and probably then some. If Trump is shown to have been the cause for actual terrorism in the US, you can imagine it ramping up even more. Trump's an asshole and no one likes him, what happens to him when he starts costing his host billions and can only offer diminishing influence in return?",

I doubt they'll delete the tweets but I'd bet they'd make them impossible to like or share again. Probably add some disclaimers.\n\nFrankly I'm expecting a massive cleansing of Trump supporters and the shit they've posted across all social media. Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they're going to be tripping over themselves to clean the toxic waste off their sites the moment it wouldn't be seen as politically bias to do so. Facebook specifically will crack down on misinformation like crazy. All to avoid the regulations that are (hopefully) coming from the new admin. Zuckerberg went in so hard for Trump to get special treatment, and it's about to backfire in spectacular fashion. Not to mention, advertisers will suddenly start having an issue with all this vile shit they've been making money off of for 5 years.\n\nI've never said this before and I'll never say this again but Murdoch was right: Americans of all political alignments are tired of him and his antics. They're over the train wreck. It isn't interesting anymore, it's just exhausting even for a lot the right. No one beyond his die hard supporters is going to give him any ratings or attention, and without that, he's not valuable enough to keep around anymore. The second he's out of the white house the spotlight goes off and the cleaning will begin.",

Put yourself in his shoes: If your goal is to continue the attack on the US, further create chaos drive the political divide, stir unrest, this could easily be accomplished by openly supporting Trump (provide refuge for Trump) and claim the US legal system mistreated him, that the US government is corrupt, and he was cheated. Trump voters/conservatives would lose further faith in the US government and systems, further radicalize them, and would find sympathy with Trump and view Putin more positively. \n\nTrump being the easily manipulated useful idiot that he is, would 100% go along with this. Plus he wants to avoid financial ruin and prison. So he really has no choice. \n\nThe icing on the cake will be the hard intelligence/national security secrets Trump would hand over. Despite him not really paying attention to intelligence reports or briefings, he still would certainly possess some level of classified/sensitive information about various things (US military readiness, national security, intelligence apparatus to some degree). You don't get a better asset than a former US President. \n\nPutin/Russia would absolutely love to have this information, and Trump would happily exchange it over for assurances of his freedom, resources, money, etc. Hell, Trump may even direct some of his staff (who flee with him) to gather more stuff to hand over. Odds are Putin is whispering this stuff into his ears right now, priming him to do so. The precedent has already been set as well. Yanukovych fled to Russia (and remains there now) when he was repudiated by Ukraine voters in 2014.",

The Congressional Review Act includes a procedure that allows for a minority of senators to discharge a proposed resolution from committee and force a vote on it. The resolution also isn't subject to filibuster, so it only needs a simple majority instead of needing to come up with 60 votes.\n\n&gt;The law provides that an agency must notify Congress whenever it issues a regulation, and a Member has 60 days to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval. (Excluded from this period are days when either the House or Senate is adjourned for more than three days.) In the Senate, such a resolution is not amendable, debate is limited to 10 hours, and it cannot be filibustered.\r  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Additionally, the CRA provides for special procedures to advance a joint resolution when it is stuck in committee in the Senate. When a joint resolution is introduced, it is referred to the committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter of the agency rule in question. In the Senate, if the committee has not reported the joint resolution 20 calendar days after the rule is submitted to Congress or it is published in the Federal register, it may be discharged if a group of 30 Senators present a petition. The provision of the Congressional Review Act allowing for the discharge petition affords the minority a significant advantage and allows them to move the joint resolution along when they normally wouldn\u2019t be able to do so.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2021/12/09/senate-passes-legislation-to-overturn-biden-administration-vaccine-mandate/",

He's electable, consistently hovering around 60% approval rating in like a R+20 state. He's folksy, down-to-earth, pretty much passes the \"I'd sit down and have a beer with him\" test. He's a farmer so can actually talk about agricultural and wildlife discussions in Congress that are important with Montanans. I mean c'mon just take one look at the guy with his flattop haircut, his entire aura is good. And on top of all that, he overwhelming votes for Democratic bills.\n\nHe takes these votes to maintain his moderate bona fides, or at least enough to anyone inspecting his record, because there's no way the veto would be overruled. It's similar to the amendment vote-a-rama that happens on budget reconciliation bills. The most recent one that comes to mind is the Inflation Reduction Act, where the GOP would put forward amendments for things they know make moderate Dems/Dems in red states look bad and they make the language such that it would only need 51 votes to successfully amend under budget recon rules. The Dems then vote down those amendments and immediately bring up basically the same amendment as the GOP but with language that subjects it to the 60-vote filibuster, so the 6-7 vulnerable Dems can still vote \"for\" the amendment and it would've worked if it wasn't for that meddling filibuster. It's all optics basically",

While Sinema ran as a progressive in her very blue district in AZ, she ran for Senate as a centrist (and beat Abboud, a progressive, in the primary). She shifted her politics to match the politics of the people she was representing, as AZ as a whole is still fairly center/center-right. In my opinion, I think the main reason Democrats have been barely winning here is that most of the Republican candidates have been Trump-aligned, and there is a pretty big anti-Trump sentiment here among Republican voters due to his attacks on McCain.\n\nSinema definitely has gone off the rails though and should be replaced with someone more like Mark Kelly. Even though he is also a centrist, he has been more consistent with his votes.",

Republicans are using it as a fail safe, becuase it would eliminate the authority should SCOTUS decide they do have the authority. \n\nThink of it like codifying Roe v Wade would make the SCOTUS opinion moot regardless of its decision.",

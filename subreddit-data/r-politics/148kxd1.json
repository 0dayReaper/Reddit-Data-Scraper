Experts and advocates say the progressives \u2014 some forming groups nationally and others in states and local communities \u2014 increasingly are in a strong position to push back.\r  \n\r  \nLiberal groups with names such as \u201cStop Moms for Liberty\u201d are campaigning for like-minded school board candidates, lobbying legislators and training parents to show up at school board meetings. They host Zooms and Facebook pages where parents can commiserate and strategize.\n\nThe burst of activity comes at a time when education activists enjoy enormous sway on the political right. When Moms for Liberty holds a national summit later this month, for instance, it will include speeches from at least four GOP presidential candidates, including former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\r  \n\r  \nIt took a while for many to engage, said Isabell Moore, public schools community organizer for Down Home NC, a North Carolina advocacy group.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMost of us are kind of just going about our daily lives, showing up for teacher appreciation day and volunteering for the PTA. Our public schools are a fact \u2014 we love them, we care about them,\" she said. There have always been parents involved, she said, but \u201cit was not \u2018til these attacks that the majority of everyday parents were like, 'We really need to jump in and take this to the next level.\u2019\u201d\r  \n\r  \nProgressive education advocacy ticked up last year and has been gaining steam since, says Sigal Ben-Porath, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who recently published \u201cCancel Wars,\u201d a book about cultural and free speech debates in education. First it was on the local level, and then with some larger national umbrella organizations.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere is a definite acceleration of organizations and mobilizing on the left in response to the book bans and the anti-LGBTQ efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is significantly on the rise.\u201d\n\n**Read more or skip the paywall with email registration: https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/06/12/progressive-education-activist-m4l/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_source=reddit.com**",

Yes the child is a person and with that come inalienable rights that are simply part of being human.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nParents DO have rights to oversee the health and well-being of that child because they are *responsible* for that child's care. Without those rights, there is no responsibility. Just as a divorced parent no longer has a say in how late the child stays up when they aren't at the legal guardian's house, or just as a parent stripped of their rights can't be charged with neglect of that same child.\n\nIt's interesting that people seem to think that we should simply treat children as adults when they are not yet there. There should be time for kids to be kids and not have to be burdened with those issues. Giving a child unrestricted rights also means that the child now carries with those rights all the responsibilities that come with them.",

The school system has them down as having such diagnoses, but they don't _understand_ them.  They continue to frame it as a \"maturity issue\" and saying \"they will grow out of it\",  waiting for us to medicate/train them into compliance at home.   \n\nLike, no folks.  That's not how this works.  Medication and therapy help in some ways, but the goal isn't compliance, it's education and long term well-being.   And no, they aren't going to \"grow out of it\" and it's not a \"maturity issue\".  \n\nMy rights as a parent are guaranteed by the state, and those rights mean I have a say in their education and can do things like demand that certain processes and accommodations are followed.  *Regardless* of the teachers/administrators personal hot take that autism doesn't exist, or ADHD is just a lack of discipline, or that they should get an F for late work because \"that's how the real world works (it's not)\"  or whatever.    \n\n\nNone of this is as simple as \"just give the parents complete power\" or \"just give the state complete power\".   But parental rights most certainly are, and should be, a thing.",

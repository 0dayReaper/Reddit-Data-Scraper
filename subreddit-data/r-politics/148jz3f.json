I'm at the cafeteria with one of them one day and there mashed potatos an gravy. He kept asking for more gravy, like he literally had more gravy than potatos an then had a hole nother tray compartment with just gravy. \n\nWe sit down and I was like \"So... you really like gravy huh?\"\n\nHe answered yes and asked me what it was. I explained it to him that is is mostly liquid fat and flower. His eyes got big and he said \"So it isn't healthy?\"\n\nAt which point I burst out laughing, like no dude it isn't. He thought it was like a type of soup and so it must be healthy. Him and his wife had been buying jars of gravy and eating them for supper. \n\nTo be fair the only thing stopping me from doing the same is fear of a heart attack or stroke.",

It was organized. There was buses bringing people in. Multiple organizations were bringing people in.\n\nOne of the big moments from the NY arraignment was that Trump supporters were fighting with Trump supporters because they thought the most outrageous characters were libs making fun of them. So you had a Qanon Shaman type character who the other Trump supporters thought was there to mock them. The guy claimed he was legit but even if he wasn't, the point is Trump supporters are wary of these events now.",

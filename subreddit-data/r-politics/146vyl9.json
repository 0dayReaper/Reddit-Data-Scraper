Had those individuals won those mid-term elections, the likelihood of them using their positions to ensure that Trump is declared the winner of the state in 2024 would be very high right now.  Some of them even ran on the promise that, if they were the state\u2019s SoS in 2024, they guaranteed Trump would be declared the winner.  How unAmerican is that?",

The danger in 2022 was that fascist elements could have legally taken control of many key levers of state government. That would have given them a lot of legal authority to will trump back into office, regardless of what voters thought. However, they failed miserably. 2022 was an epic win for Democracy and it is barely acknowledged in the deluge of doom that fills our screens to sell clicks.",

Biden's administration is fresh on everyone's mind, while Trump's botching of COVID response has faded from memory.\n\nAll this legal stuff? It should be damning. But in comparison the COVID response was just so much more a direct impact on people's lives and physical safety. Is it really an equivalent trade-off in motivating voters?",

I've yet to meet anyone who isn't a right wing knob slobber that doesn't think the documents thing is super bad. Biden having a similar (but much much much less serious) scenario took some of the heat off though which isn't good.",

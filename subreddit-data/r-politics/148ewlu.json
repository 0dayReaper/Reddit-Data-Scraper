From 2016 to 2020 the trump administration, the trump DOJ, and the trump FBI had ample time to investigate Hillary. Ample time to appoint a special prosecutor. Ample time to bring her to court. And they never even tried. My answer to republicans? If Hillary was equally guilty, why did you do nothing for 4 years? Why now scream about it only when an obviously guilty trump is going to trial?\n\nYeah. Answer that.",

Do you want a president who can't be trusted with a security clearance?!\"  Totally defendable truthful criticism.  Short enough for a commercial.  Can be repeated endlessly in interviews to tar the opponent, etc.  \n\nBut they had to pretend this was equivalent to Snowden and WikiLeaks.  It's BS.  But the weirdest part is that it was *unnecessary*.  The \"can't be trusted with a security clearance\" line is totally sufficient to rile up the faithful.  I can picture a crowd of MAGA's chanting, \"Can't be trusted!  Can't be trusted!\"  \n\nBut they had to go all the way to \"Lock get up!\"  I swear it's just become such habit to demonize their opponents that they no longer have any setting other than 11.",

Now Trump commands a fervent base of republican voters that the GOP needs in order to win.\n\nThe GOP built a problem for themselves. Dump trump and piss off a chunk of your voting base. Back Trump and alienate centrist republicans and independents.Thr GOP's policies are becoming less and less favorable to a larger and larger segment of voters in general so they need every vote they can get to win but now a conman has control of the party.",

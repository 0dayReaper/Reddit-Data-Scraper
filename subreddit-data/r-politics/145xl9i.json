What I *will* say is actually going to be emphasized in the form of a question:\n\nWhy is it that the current responses of your leadership in regards to this new set of indictments; is considered \"leaping into action\"?\n\nHere's why I ask: I *thought* Durham was supposed to \"bring the heat\" and finally drop the real charges against Democratic leadership that had been promised to *you*, the voter, for *years* now.\n\nI *thought* the Democrats who \"committed treason\" were headed straight to prison? I *thought* you had **absolute proof** of every last crime that was committed by Democrat leadership.\n\nSo.....**where are the charges?**\n\nBecause I will tell you this: If your Republican leadership is selling to you (again, the voter) the idea that they ***are*** putting REAL effort forth to \"bring down this criminal enterprise once and for all!\" then **how** did a \"*key witness\"* up and \"Vanish\" out of thin air? and most importantly: ***where are your federal charges?***\n\nAre you guys intentionally voting in people who *say* what you want to hear, but then are laughably incapable of following through? Yet, you *continue to trust that they even* ***can****?* and you SERIOUSLY have NO clouds of doubt hanging over you after Durham failed spectacularly? Bro, you all said it was going to unearth the \"crime of the century\". His investigation finished. Where are your indictments? Does this *not* get you to think about any of this?\n\nWe know where *our* indictments are. How about you guys? Where are they? Where? \n\nWhy is it that \"Democrats keep being one step ahead!\" when you always claim they are stupid, in denial and don't know how to exist without dying of starvation within the restrictions of real life?\n\nMy main question is: Why do you consider this to be \"leaping into action\" when **a failed investigation that yielded ZERO indictments** *doesn't raise ANY red flags to you that just maybe your approach, logic, rhetoric and lack of critical thinking are completely flawed from the absolute most basic-level of structure.* \n\nBut no, THIS is \"leaping into action\". **Impotent. The word is impotent.** Just like *Durham, eh?*",

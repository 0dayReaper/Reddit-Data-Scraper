It\u2019s cut off in a lot of pictures posted to create fake rage.\n\nUntil people stop wearing the American flag, eating off American flag plates, drinking out of coozies, printing Trump\u2019s name on it and waving it at rallies, turning it into an agenda for blue lives, turning the stripes into AR-15\u2019s, waving confederate flags on main street, and waving nazi flags at Disney World, then something as peaceful as hanging the Unity flag for a month of solidarity with fellow Americans shouldn\u2019t be up for debate.",

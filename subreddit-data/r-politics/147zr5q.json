All of their maps had the name Israel scratched out. They would not even acknowledge the existence of Israel. Then in 2020, UAE and Israel started formal diplomatic relations with the Abraham Accords. Myself along with many other Expats that spent time in UAE were blown away.",

They view themselves as oppressed victims, defenders of the faith, soldiers following orders, ..., anything but people with the freedom to choose because that would mean they are morally accountable for choosing to deliberately harm others. It's a classic case of \"bad faith\".\n\nThe actual thing they get worked up about and the supposed rationale doesn't matter in the slightest and to engage with them on it is pointless.

Oh well fuck them i guess, its not like sick children can vote.\n\nIts all so very obviously pandering to win a vote because he was told that is how to appeal to his base. Its like when big corporations release ads supporting this that or the other cause... The are using that to make you buy... not because they actually support that cause.",

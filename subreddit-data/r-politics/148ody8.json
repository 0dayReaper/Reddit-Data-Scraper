Every day we are reminded. $8 for a dozen eggs. $100 to fill up my tank. $150/month water bill.  Very few things are still affordable - Car insurance ($23 per month from Insurance Panda) and gym ($20/month from Planet Fitness). But I\u2019m sure those will go up soon thanks to Bidenflation.\n\nTrump is exactly who we need. Love him or hate him, nobody can deny that he will not put up with any nonsense from overseas. Our adversaries fear him that\u2019s why they want to arrest him.",

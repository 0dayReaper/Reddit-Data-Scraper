Instead, Mueller did not do that and he let Bill Barr obfuscate Mueller's report.\n\nThe thing that irked me the most was that when Mueller testified in Congress, he wouldn't even read his own report.

It was essentially an internal newsletter that pointed out Russia was actively trying to phish small town election officials.  It's something any of us could have guessed was happening given what we'd learned about Trump and Russia and Facebook/Cambridge Analytica's collusion in the 2016 election.  But it was something that Trump administration officials were denying left and right, and this leak showed them to be liars.\n\nAfter spending years helping our country by being trained to intercept and read several rare foreign languages, she was a bit put off seeing her commanders just brazenly lying and denying that Russia was actively trying to infiltrate elections across the country.\n\nSo she leaked the newsletter that confirmed it was happening.  No sources and methods, just confirmation of what we all suspected.  But it revealed the administration and top generals had been lying, seemingly just to preserve the big lie that Russia had no part in getting trump elected.\n\nShe admitted it within a hour of being interviewed, and got $2 million worth of legal defence from the news outlet that betrayed her. \n\nEven with the immediate confession and her years of valuable and unique service, she got a 5.5 year sentence.  She had a predictably awful prison experience, and her release conditions are draconian.\n\nThe true news story should be how soon before trump commences his 20 year federal prison term.",

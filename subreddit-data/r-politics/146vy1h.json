Statements a defendant makes supporting their own case out of court are considered \"self-serving hearsay\" and are not admissible in court.  This is not 'unfair' to a defendant, since if a defense really wants a defendant to testify in their own defense, they can call them to the stand, where they are under oath and subject to cross examination.\n\nParty-opponent statements are exempt from evidence rules that exclude hearsay, so any statement a defendant makes out of court that *harms* their defense is admissible evidence.  This is the same rule that allows out of court confessions to be admissible; and this is why a lawyer will advise their client to *keep their mouth shut.*",

His residence was raided in August 2022, so he was out of office only about 19 months by that point. This is still within his theoretical \"two year grace period.\" \n\nIt's not that nobody asked for them back for 2 years. It's that NARA asked for them back, the FBI demanded for them to be returned, and Trump refused. \n\nThe \"I was allowed to keep them for 2 years\" is his flimsy attempt at a legal defense. He's trying to claim that the DOJ just had to wait an additional 5 months and then they would have been legally fine. Of course, had the FBI waited 5 more months, Trump would be claiming that he gets 3 years to sort through things.\n\nTo go back to my analogy, it's as if I started speeding, two miles in an officer pulled me over, and I told the officer that he needed to wait 3 more miles before he was legally able to pull me over. I could argue this all I wanted, but there's no legal basis for my claim and I'd be forced to pay the speeding ticket.",

No, the indictment does not depend upon this at all.\n\nYes, Trump did not declassify any documents.  The documents recovered via the search warrant identified as classified remain as such.  No, nothing in the indictment depends upon the status of said documents.\n\nYes, the Presidential Records Act explicitly delineates between presidential records and personal records and the president is entitled to retain personal records.  None of that matters.  The indictment does not depend upon this.  Furthermore, an entire and very broad category is caveated out from this delineation.  That category may be summarized as \"things belonging to other departments\".  Even if these documents were declassified or were never classified, they do not and never did belong to Trump.\n\nIt's dangerous enough to perpetuate the sort of corruption whereby we maintain different standards based on wealth, power or party.  But there is a danger here the way these clowns are going about it.  By entertaining these tortuous, nonsensical legal arguments, we essentially negate these laws.\n\nFollowing these legal arguments from Team Trump would pretty neuter and negate the PRA and all these other laws regarding classified documents, including the one Trump signed himself.\n\nAnd... after all of that.  The obstruction charges **alone** are utterly damning.  If you are sure of your legal arguments, you do not need to lie and hide.\n\nOne **cannot** support Trump on this matter without shredding rule of law.",

It allows for good-faith negotiation with the National Archives. Yet the indictment assumes that Pres. Trump had no right to take any classified documents.  \nThis doesn\u2019t fit the spirit or letter of the PRA, which was written by Congress to recognize that such documents had previously been the property of former Presidents. If the Espionage Act means Presidents can\u2019t retain any classified documents, then the PRA is all but meaningless.

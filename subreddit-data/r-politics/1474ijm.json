It was shredding my mattress and just pooping everywhere. Turned out it was like a prize winning fancy racehorse and we were paranoid in the dream that we would be accused of horse theft. \n\nAnyway I had a lot more horse-in-not-horse place-anxiety dreams in those four years than ever in my life.",

If I dont hear about something, he's got it under control and isnt starting a war.\n\nIt's like letting your kids run around the neighborhood unsupervised until dinner.

He is old, but the other side of the coin is he had the experience in Congress needed to handle dipshits like McCarthy.

The guy is horrible, I don't know why just because Republicans are fascist pieces of shit you guys have this weird need to convince yourself Biden is done great guy with high goals for humanity.\n\nBiden is the guy that tried to cut social security 6 times, invented work requirements, penned the busing bills, the crack baby bill, the crack house bill. He's been personally involved in the biggest tax cuts for the wealthy, cowtails to corporations and the energy industry, and collapses under pressure. He gave people like Manchin and Republicans enduring they wanted with the infrastructure bill... Throwing away the bill that actially created jobs and relief for americans, and passed through one that was all corporate contracts, all well never publicly criticizing Manchin or sinema by name even once.\n\n\nAre dems better then Republicans? Sure they are... They have to pretend to care about their voters and what their voters want, but don't be mistaken, democrats are corpratists and center right wing at best, completely corrupt at worse. They work for their donors not us, and they show it over and over and over again. You should vote dem if it's the better option, but you should criticize Biden at every chance you get and call 9ut democrats MORE then Republicans.\n\nThe truth is Republicans are a terrible party playing with fascism that would have no chance of winning if democrats actualky tried. If they passed basic legislation that helped Americans when they had super majorities, Republicans would never ever win another election without a complete left swing of their party platform. Democrat incompetence allows the political elite to swing right by being so incredibly incompetent, and they are 100 percent paid opposition at this point, ushering in right wing policy their donors want and using Republicans as an excuse.\n\nIf that wasn't true they would of fired the parliamentarian, codified roe, and fought tooth and nail for every piece of legislation that helps americans. But they don't, and they never will, because they work for corporate America.",

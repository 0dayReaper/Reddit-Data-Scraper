Any win for him only boosts him up, and helps him overall, even if it has no real bearing on the numerous charges that could be filed against him....although if he gets off on a lot of these cases it may make it harder to get convictions on other cases, as people may start to see them as witch hunts.",

What a bunch of doomer BS since you cant complain about no charges anymore.\n\nWhile I appreciate your passion for the subject and the time it took you to reply, you completely missed the point. \n\nOf course Trump knows he lost. He thinks he lost because of voting machine glitches and lost votes, he doesn\u2019t *actually* think he lost. He thinks the system played him. \n\nTrump lost the election, that\u2019s for absolute certain. The reason he won anyway is because of the havoc he brought upon our nation. We haven\u2019t been this divided since the civil war. Trump has *33* allegations of rape, but there are still 75 million people who support him anyway. The reason Roe vs Wade fell is because of him. People learned that they could be outwardly racist (again) with no consequences. He staged a coup that almost succeeded. He literally brainwashed half a nation into thinking he\u2019s sent from god or something. He keeps copies of Hitlers speeches on his bedside table to read. He wanted to start a dictatorship, and openly admires the way people fear Putin.\n\nThe only thing comparable is when Reganomics and trickle down economics were introduced, and companies started making record profits while driving the prices up for basic goods that the common people started struggling to be able to afford. The ripple that Regan created is not only still in effect today, it\u2019s taken over our country as a whole. We\u2019ll see something similar with the Trump presidency, this is only the beginning. \n\nHe won from a phycological warfare position, warfare that\u2019ll last decades due to the divide and mistrust he sowed into our country.",

As a lawyer you get a client that will not listen to advice, reportedly has a history on deadbeating folks and then fires you for not being aggressive enough?",

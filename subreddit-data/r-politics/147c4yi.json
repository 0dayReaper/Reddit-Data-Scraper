We haven\u2019t been this divided since the civil war. Trump has *33* allegations of rape, but there are still 75 million people who support him anyway. The reason Roe vs Wade fell is because of him. People learned that they could be outwardly racist (again) with no consequences. He staged a coup that almost succeeded. He literally brainwashed half a nation into thinking he\u2019s sent from god or something. He keeps copies of Hitlers speeches on his bedside table to read. He wanted to start a dictatorship, and openly admires the way people fear Putin.\n\nThe only thing comparable is when Reganomics and trickle down economics were introduced, and companies started making record profits while driving the prices up for basic goods that the common people started struggling to be able to afford. The ripple that Regan created is not only still in effect today, it\u2019s taken over our country as a whole.

I used to like Dershowitz even if did not like who he defended. Everyone in America gets a defense. Everyone. Dems the rules. And I agree with his saying \u201c may a hundred guilty men go free before one innocent man\u201d in theory lol and also he uses the money to defend rich people to work pro bono to defend poor ones.  but this whole defending trump thing it seems he is more interested in being a talking head then actually defending trump also I kinda feel he has lost his way.",

It wasn\u2019t until later in life, before she passed, she admitted she didn\u2019t get a local because she was a smoker and couldn\u2019t smoke when her lips were numb. She chose pain so she could smoke. Crazy! Thankfully she quit smoking after 50+ years when she was 70. My dad would ask her if she was glad she quit smoking and she\u2019d say no, but she wasn\u2019t going back.",

Even on a simple root canal?\n\nNo. Powers are transferred during periods of incapacity. Novocain doesn't incapacitate a person. It's just a bad headline. We tend to use the term 'sedation' these days when we refer to dentistry where they use anything more than local anesthesia, but even this isn't that precise a term, because sedation dentistry can just mean you get a xanax and some local anesthesia, it can mean you get nitris, or it can mean they full on put you under with propofol.\n\nJust depends. Dentistry as a whole has gotten pretty good these days, and unless someone has an issue where local anesthetics don't work (pulpitis can cause this), even root canals are fairly painless. --I literally just had a tooth extracted today. Worst pain was from the 40 minutes of clenching gauze over the socket. This isn't news-worthy. Unless the dude was getting a dental abscess vented, it wasn't a thing of concern.",

My dentist explained it to me like this.  In a root canal, your tooth is essentially dead, the pulp/nerves underneath are dead or close to it.  He used a device that sends a low grade electric current to the tooth in varying charges.  (Google search calls it a pulp vitality tester)  If the patient can withstand a high charge, it shows the pulp/tooth is dead.  He used a very high setting and I barely felt it at all.  My tooth was dead.  For comparison he used the lowest setting on a nearby tooth.  I felt that!!!  Minus the discomfort of dental work in general, a local with a novocaine type numbing agents can be applied.",

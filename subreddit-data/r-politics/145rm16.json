He is ready to feed them a steady stream of delays from Judge Aileen Cannon until the dark money firehose understands that it's impossible to put a spin on a lot of this.  At some point they will start complaining that Smith is deliberately dragging his feet to keep this in the news for the whole election cycle.\n\nTrump is bad. But the problem will not be solved until we **follow the money**, and jack Smith has a plethora of \"Trump charges\" to waste to get at bigger and more shadowy fish.",

Would he offer up some good information in exchange for a lesser sentence?\n\nI saw him (Nauta) listed when reading some of the doc and was shocked to see someone else charged.  I was a bit surprised that he hadn't worked a deal.  Either he is that much of a Trump Puppet or Smith felt he didn't need the cooperation since everything was on tape.\n\nI'm gonna assume he's the type that's going to go down with the ship fully expecting that he'll be pardoned and then made a millionaire.  A brainwashed marching ant.\n\nThey'll both probably be throwing each other under the bus soon enough.",

The DOJ is giving him every opportunity to slow walk a possible conviction.  The case is in Florida, Trumps favorite judge has been assigned, and he has new lawyers that will want to move back any trial date so they can get up to speed on the case.  \n\nThere will be appeals and motions that will slow this case down by months, if not years.  Certainly past the 24 election where Trump and Republicans will do everything in their power to cheat and regain the oval office.  \n\nThe fact that there haven't been searches of Trump Tower and Bedminster prove the FBI and DOJ are slow walking this case.  \n\nI have zero faith in Jack Smith until Trump is behind bars along with his congressional enablers.

And secondly, I don't believe it matters if this doesn't wrap up before the election. Him being disqualified somehow would be nice, but there's no evidence that he's going to win the election anyway, trial or no.  If it's Biden v Trump then I have to believe Biden will win again.  Trump has gained no new significant support since the last time, and Biden may strike some as uninspiring or something along those lines but he's inarguably a stable, safe choice for president, especially when the alternative is Trump.  If he's the eventual nominee, people will show up to vote against him; these multiplying indictments are not endearing to anyone outside of his base.  \n Again, some new factors may arise as time goes on which could change things, and most of the above is only my opinion.  But Trump is in deep shit right now, literal issues of national security.  I know we're all a little jaded and/or cynical when it comes to him, but the circumstances surrounding Trump these days are not in his favor.  One of his lawyers was on Good Morning America yesterday, proclaiming his innocence and unfairness of the investigation, swearing his client will fight and prevail, and by noon the same day he resigned - it's really bad.",

The probability of a judge being assigned to the FBI raid case is 1 out of 23, and the probability of the same judge being assigned to the indictment of classified documents case is also 1 out of 23.\n\nSince we are interested in both events happening (the judge being assigned to both cases), we multiply the individual probabilities together:\n\nProbability of being assigned to both cases = Probability of FBI raid case \u00d7 Probability of indictment case\n\nProbability of being assigned to both cases = (1/23) \u00d7 (1/23) = 1/529 \u2248 0.00189 or approximately 0.189%\n\nTherefore, the probability of a judge being randomly assigned to both the FBI raid case involving Donald Trump and the recently announced indictment of classified documents, given a pool of 23 judges, is approximately 0.189%.",

To be honest, it is not much different elsewhere, only the extremes are softened by the legal codification of rights and responsibilities which restrict extreme wealth aggregation and require action on the part of the state to ensure basic tools for survival in the modern world, things like health care, education which is affordable or free, etc.\n\nThe problem is, passing laws in the USA are meaningless, because a) the extremely vague wording of the US basic law or Constitution leaves permanent points of argument and loopholes for overturning laws and b) states can ignore laws passed by the federal government. c) there is just too much sociopathy in the USA which is treated as a virtue instead of the disease which it is.",

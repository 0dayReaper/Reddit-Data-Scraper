I read the [actual letter](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/politics/senate-republicans-biden-letter-covid-relief/index.html), though, rather than jump to conclusions, and I'm curious...\n\n\"According to the U.S. Department of Education, as of last month, states have spent only $4.38 billion of the emergency 68 billion in K-12 funding provided last year . . . $7 billion was directed to governors to meet education needs in their states, of which only $1.5 billion has been spent.\"  So the republicans' issue is questioning why schools are being given $130 billion, when they're spending so little of what they already were granted.\n\nSo as a teacher, my question is... where is the unspent money going, and why aren't schools using it?  Is it tied up somewhere?  I mean, our school's HVAC system is older than me, I'm sure it could use an update.  We scavenged chromebooks for kids this year (still open in person, but wanted to go one-to-one in case that had to change and to reduce sharing computer carts), but some have keys missing, and plenty have seen better days.  I'd love to know who is holding the purse strings, because I'm 99% sure my district didn't get a piece of that pie.  We got money to cover 10 days of COVID leave for teachers, and I'm pretty sure that's it.\n\nI am nowhere near the republican end of the spectrum, but I can see how purportedly fiscal conservatives would blink at $130 billion when over $60 billion went unspent last time.  I'd be all for $130 billion being granted as long as school are actually getting it.  Anyone have more info on what's up with this?",

There\u2019s a whole lot more but that was the big ticket stuff. \n\nOne of the problems is they keep moving the goal posts on us. They originally told us it had to be spent last December. Then at the end of December it got extended to December 2021. At that point everything has already been committed. So the things you may have wanted to do but couldn\u2019t because of the time crunch, you now have time to but no more money to do it. \n\nThe other problem is the funds were broken up as different allocations that were given based on different District requirements. A good amount was for districts with a high percentage of low income students. However, preparing facilities to protect staff and students is not unique to low income districts. So some Districts weren\u2019t able to accomplish as much as others because of it.",

It is a coordinated attack on democracy itself today. The coup did not start on the 6th nor did it end there. The GOP hate voting.\n\nThe Republicans are trying to do through legislation what they failed to do through litigation. Their stacked  federal courts will let them.  \n\nThis means we must all vote more and not slip back into apathy. Vote in every local state and federal election and primary to remove the threat to our democracy. This year in 2021 vote and every year after that.\n\nPS. If your are a registered republican that values democracy change your registration",

I got into healthcare a few years ago because I wanted to help people and be a positive impact on the community. Now I can't even feel good about what I'm doing and I'm just in it for the paycheck.

They were also the key to GOP gerrymandering to dilute the urban vote in a lot of states without extraordinarily ugly districts. Suburbia is also growing and becoming more diverse and rural areas are shrinking. \n\nThe GOP has two choices here: abandon Trump now, get backlash from his base, regain credibility among suburban voters, and be in decent shape long-term; or continue to embrace Trump, solidify suburban voters against the GOP, keep their base fired up, and have potential benefits short-term before permanently being relegated to the minority.\n\nThey seem to be embracing the latter despite a lot of Republican politicians being really unhappy about it. They're all afraid of their primaries and not the generals, and the more extreme their challenges in the primary, the worse their chances in the general. They're refusing to rip the band-aid off now and are instead letting the wound fester.",

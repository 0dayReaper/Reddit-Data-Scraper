She said she was a \"great student with great grades,\" and \"dropped out of school\" to have her first child.\n\nSo how did she \"drop out to have a baby\" at 19, if she was a great student with great grades?\n\n&gt;But when it comes to her 17-year-old son Tyler, whose teenage girlfriend is pregnant, Ms Boebert took a more circumspect approach. In an interview on The Rubin Report on Thursday, host Dave Rubin asked the second-term congresswoman about how she regards the prospect of becoming a grandmother at the age of 36. \n&gt;\n&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lauren-boebert-son-teenage-pregnancy-b2312128.html\n\nChild's age, as aligned with:\n\n&gt;\u201cI didn\u2019t go through the typical education course,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a great student. I had great grades. I loved being there, but I was starting my family and had different priorities.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/lauren-boebert-defends-her-past-during-durango-visit/\n\n\n&gt;She also wrote that they did not break any Colorado laws while they were dating and that her mother approved of their relationship. The age of consent in Colorado is 17.\n&gt;\n&gt;In her memoir, Lauren Boebert says her husband didn't expose himself and simply \"acted like he was going to unzip his pants\" after having too much to drink. She adds that police were called after he threw a basket of fries at the owner of the bowling alley.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"He knew the truth \u2014 and the truth was, he didn't do what he was accused of,\" she writes. \"But the entire experience opened Jayson's eyes to the reality that he needed the alcohol and anger management classes that came with the plea deal.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/lauren-boebert-husband-kids-relationship-timeline-photos\n\nRight.  Because a guy who would expose himself to teens in a bowling alley would definitely wait for her to be 17, and clearly, any alcohol and anger management courses haven't worked out well for him, either.  Not for over twenty years, now.\n\nShe's all about rewriting the past of a girl gone wild, and \"family values\" that are in reality, all about hiding dysfunctional behavior.",

She's become the GOP's useful idiot, and she doesn't even know it. Though I think the GOP is beginning to regret pushing clowns like her, Margie Green, etc into the spotlight.

Boebert called the reporter a liar. To prove it, she would need to prove the claims against her are false, or the reporter clearly didn\u2019t do his research. However Boebert never pursued these claims. What this case is is the reporter accusing Boebert of slander, so he will need to prove that Boebert either knew he was telling the truth or didn\u2019t research her claims when calling him a liar.\n\nBasically Boebert could\u2019ve easily denied the claims, but by calling the reporter\u2019s honesty into question she now has to prove that he was knowingly dishonest or didn\u2019t properly research his claims. If he can show he did his due diligence in researching this story, he wins.",

It's not enough to say the story isn't true, you have to knowingly allege specific facts which you know to be wrong about the story and about the person making the story, that a reasonable person would believe that you would know.\n\nI haven't seen the allegations in this particular law suit, but _in general_ someone can deny that a story is true without opening themselves up to a defamation lawsuit.  She would have had to have make a specific allegation about this person, which a reasonable person would believe that she would know, and which she knew to be false or should have known was false.    And the plaintiff in the lawsuit _always_ has the burden of proof, which is why E Jean Carroll expended a tremendous amount of effort in the lawsuit proving that her story was true and that she wasn't a liar and that trump knew she wasn't a liar.",

He is awful and manifestly stupid in a way that demands careful, sustained effort on his part, but \"wow! that exhaustingly dumb escort from last night should be a Congressional representative\" feels more like a Paul Gosar or a Louie Gohmert kind of stupid. Cruz would probably have been more happy never to have to see or think about her ever again.\n\nIf we granted that the rest were nevertheless true, it seems more likely to me that someone else told Cruz that Boebert must run for office, however improbable the prospect, and that Cruz must help make it happen, because they were now in possession of compelling compromising evidence to ensure that both Cruz and Boebert did what they were told. Boebert is not the kind of person who just decides to do something like this on her own, and Cruz is not the kind of person to just offer someone help.",

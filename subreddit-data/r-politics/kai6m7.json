Look how great I've made America in only 4 years, something no one else could have done and look at how high the stock market is!!!! That's all because of me!!! Buy look at the china fake flu, it killed 3000 people yesterday while sleepy joe biden was hiding in his basement.  I personally discovered the new vaccine for this fake china flu that you don't need to wear a mask for because it's fake, and it won't kill you, but I made a vaccine anyways.  Bigly, tremendous",

Would there have been more attacks? Mass panic? Or would we have just not gotten into two horrible wars and had no TSA/DHS/ICE? That last part sounds pretty good. \n\nThen again, if it were Trump, he probably would've invited Bin Laden to the White House and put Muslims in camps, so maybe actually worse than Bush (hard to fathom, I know).",

Any time you call something \"the most\", you're setting yourself up for a counterargument unless you're coming with numbers to back up that claim (and maybe even then).\n\nEdit: actually, it seems like the Newsweek writer just looked at Der Spiegel's wiki page:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Spiegel\n\nThis page states it's the largest weekly news magazine in Europe. So at least now we know why they wrote the headline like that, but still. There's a difference between \"the weekly news magazine with the highest number of prints in Europe\" and \"Europe's biggest news magazine\". Note that the wiki page narrowed it down to weekly magazines, and looked at number of prints.",

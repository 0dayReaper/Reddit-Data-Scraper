You can even have multiple contradictory reasons, since hey, at least one of them must be correct! It's a technique known as \"Kettle Logic:\"\n\n&gt; Freud relates the story of a man who was accused by his neighbour of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition and the three arguments he offers.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. That he had returned the kettle undamaged\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. That it was already damaged when he borrowed it\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. That he had never borrowed it in the first place\n&gt;\n&gt;Though the three arguments are inconsistent, Freud notes that it is so much the better, as if even one is found to be true then the man must be acquitted.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle_logic",

And if I did, I returned the kettle undamaged! And if I returned it damaged, it was already damaged when I borrowed it! (Then you're ready to go back to the beginning). And by the way, I never borrowed it in the first place! \n\nViola, you can keep going around in circles. When someone starts tying to dispute one of the points, you immediately switch to the next point, and then back to the beginning.\n\nThis is a core feature of all kinds of denialist tactics, for example global warming: The Earth is NOT warming! And if it is, humans have absolutely nothing to do with it! And if they do have something to do with it, it's impossible to do anything about it! And if it is possible, it's too expensive! And by the way, the Earth is NOT warming!",

Very likely it was stuff like schedules or meeting notes - materials that accidentally get swept up when you're cleaning or when you're working for a zillion hours in a week and simply don't notice it. That's why the NARA didn't make a federal case out of those documents being missing - put simply, they *didn't even notice*.\n\nWhat FPOTUS took was material damaging to the national security of the United States of America. They *immediately* demanded it back - as soon as he left office he was notified the documents were missing and they needed them back. He said he didn't have anything, to the NARA, in a signed affidavit countersigned by his lawyers. The Federal government gave him time and time and time again to get them in order, until they finally turned it over to the FBI and they got a search warrant to go find them. And find them in his possession they did... except for the ones that they *know he took and still to this day hasn't turned over*.\n\nBoth the circumstances *and* the material matter in this case. If he'd just kept some of his work week schedules, the NARA might not have even called. He took items that cause material harm to the United States. And for that... he's going to prison.",

It usually involves a bunch of defense mechanisms going up. Trump is still in that stage.\n\nThe point where they have nowhere mentally left to run and have to*face* things is decompensation, when the defenses fall apart. I've seen narcissists hit this stage a couple of times; it requires a lot of time and effort and cognition. Usually has to be very systematic.\n\nSince his brain is mush, I don't think Trump is capable of the latter. He'll just go into a loop, cycling through the same handful of narcissistic defenses over and over, ignoring all outside inputs. Might as well be making baby noises to him, for all he'll understand.",

            "comment": "This is the downside of having a Trump loyalist preside over the case.  When Judge Dearie was the appointed special master over the documents last fall, he lowered the boom on this kind of theatrics.  Most people don\u2019t remember now, but when Trump made the public claim that documents were planted, Dearie ordered Trump\u2019s lawyers to sign an affidavit under oath about whether the they wished to contest the legitimacy of any of the documents the DOJ had seized.  He actually required them to print an inventory of the entire seizure and submit the inventory marked line by line whether they were admitting that document was in Trump\u2019s possession, or if they were asserting that document was planted.  That was the last day Trump ever claimed the documents were planted.\n\nThis would never happen under Cannon.  But we need this kind of \u201cstraight talk\u201d in this case.  We need judges like Dearie that will say \u201cMr. Trump, you claimed on Truth Social that the documents were planted.  I am *ordering you* to submit a written affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that corroborates the claims you made in public, or admits you were lying.  And I\u2019ll need that affidavit on my desk by COB tomorrow.  If you are going to say some shit at a rally on Monday, you better say it to me under oath on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nTrump was forced to submit an affidavit that said, under oath, that *he did not believe any documents were planted.*  All of this double-talk can so easily be stopped in its tracks.  If you believe it, swear to it, and if you don\u2019t believe it, admit that you made it up.",

And even if she does decide to forever lash herself to the mast of the sinking Trump ship, DOJ is going to do the same thing last time, namely appeal to a court that doesn't have donny's mushroom in their mouth. Plus there is real possibility of indictments in NJ and DC, and that is before you get to the Jan 6th stuff, the Georgia stuff, and so on. Cannon can't save him.",

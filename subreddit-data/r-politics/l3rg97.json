Although Illinois always goes blue because of Chicago, a majority of the state districts vote red\n\nWhen he took office, Republicans relentlessly tried to attack him as *\u201danother corrupt billionaire politician\u201d*. At first people were a bit weary of him (especially since Blagojevich) but when covid came, he stepped the fuck up like a champ\n\nHe handled it extremely well, and is continuing to do so. They tried to start some \u201cJB sucks\u201d campaign which flopped as the pandemic continued. So much so that by November, 4 counties just straight tried to secede from the state. He\u2019s by far one of the best governors in Illinois history and is making real change, hopefully more states will start to follow this pattern",

A lot of federal tax money is coming from those cities.\n\nApart from those rural regions contributing less, there's a shitton of federal help for them, for example: avalanche protection, subsidies for farmers in the mountains, tourism promotion, funding for national parks, financial compensation (four out of 7 net payers are small cantons with big cities, the other 3 net payers are tax havens benefiting from nearby cities), \"service publice\" which means some companies that get to provide stuff like public transportation have to provide this service in rural regions too, where its not exactly profitable.",

Republicans in rural areas desperately want it dismantled and sold off to become a private company because something something socialism, but the USPS is literally the only reason they _get_ mail because it's federally mandated that they service literally every registered address in the country no matter what. If it was up to a private company like UPS, FedEx, or DHL, they just wouldn't service anywhere 20 miles outside of a major hub. Hell, that's basically what those companies already do, because they pass everything like that off to the USPS.",

Of those 40,000 corporate returns, 44% had no tax liability and 88% paid less than 10k in taxes and 385 corporations paid 70% of all corporate taxes. \n\nYup. \n\nBut anyway, it's definitely the Indy metro area that funds the most of the state..",

All they have to do is tell them is that the benefits they're getting are either because of the Republicans or some kind of delayed benefit from Trump. If they can't find a way to make it seem like that, they'll try and play it off like it's actually bad. Or they'll do some of that good old fashioned turning the middle class on the lower class by saying \"hey why is that lazy black person getting what your getting? They shouldn't be allowed to have that.\"\n\n\nNever, **EVER** underestimate the power and effectiveness of this right wing propaganda and lies machine. It has been actively turning people against their own interests for decades, and the work it accomplished these last 4 years is nothing short of a masterpiece in propaganda. If it has their usual audiences attention, they will tell them anything and it will work. Biden and Sanders would literally walk up to these people's houses, put the bills in their hands, and the machine would *still* be able to convince them to vote against the Dems. The machine may as well be plugging these people into the damn Matrix because there's just no way to reach them if they won't escape the machine themselves.\n\nWe can not out-maneuver this problem. We have seen this machine get stronger and stronger, its effects more and more destructive. One of the number one priorities on our list *has* to be doing something to destroy it. As long as it exists, the cancer at the heart of country, in our culture, in our society, it will never go into remission.",

It's nothing short of astonishing. I have a feeling psychology/sociology/poli sci classes will be talking about this phenomenon for a long time, if the country makes it that long anyway. If not then _other_ countries will be talking about it as part of their \"Downfall of America\" classes.",

When will the return be on a jobs retraining program, for example? Two years? Three? That's already past the midterms. You'd have to set it up, enroll people, get them through it, then wait for them to do a job search. It would be years before the first person was hired, longer to observe a wide-spread difference.

Kinda underhanded tactic wise, I will be the first to admit. But after 2020 and how the GOP repeatedly abused the system, it bothers me much less than it would've a year and a half ago. The reason why I trust the Democrats more than the GOP to govern is because the Democrats *are* more of a coalition, and there are varying voices that will usually arrive at some type of sane compromise. Hell, the Democrats as they are are actually more conservative than most of their voters would like, for exactly that reason. The GOP is much more monolithic, and with much less diversity in their ranks. So there's less pushback within their numbers if someone is abusing the system, or doing something beyond the pale. They don't reflect the diversity of people or cultures or thought that the U.S. represents, and that's part and parcel of the issues they're having right now with their party splitting down the middle.",

What are Republican's attempting to do?  What RESULTS came about actions from both sides.  Explain it.  Explain it relentlessly.  Do NOT expect American citizens to self-research and do their due diligence.  Feed it to them.  Give them all the information they'd ever need to make good, informed decisions.  Teach them.  Mentor them.\n\nWhat about counter attacks by Republicans?  Perfect.  I WISH this happens too.  Facts are facts, and truth is truth.  It's undisputable.  If the information is there clear as day and the PR is relent, no backing down from any challenge, then you'll stand a chance to maybe education some people and make them understand what's truly right, what's truly good.  If done right, lies will only be that, lies, clear and apparent lies.  Truth will hold because people will stand behind it and defend it absolutely.

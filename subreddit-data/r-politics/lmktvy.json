Not cowboys fighting at the Alamo; but a coward that runs from trouble and accountability while leaving others to fend for themselves.\n\nIf they keep picking Ted Cruz to represent them; well, that's their choice to let everyone know Ted Cruz represents them.\n\n**Edit 2**:\n\nI'm not the only that's had this idea.\n\n&gt;When the going got tough in Texas, Ted Cruz got going and left Texas behind.\n\nhttps://fledcruz.com/\n\nThe person that snagged that domain deserves a raise lmao.",

That\u2019s how awful I feel he is for our state, our country and this world!\n\nADDITION: To the poster who attacked me because I said. I don\u2019t even care who\u2019s running against Cruz, I wrote you a response but you deleted your comment. I don\u2019t want the battery power I\u2019ve used to go to waste so here\u2019s your response anyway:\n\nTypical attack. I\u2019m not going to bother explaining to you my interest and trek Into political research as your comment is meant to elicit a response rather than try to gain any actual understanding of me or my motivations. I am a centrist and Ted Cruz, who does represent me in our government, in no way reflects my beliefs or opinions. He is so far skewed to the right that he represents very few of us  as we are not in his club. He is corrupt. He lies. He is not someone I respected at all when he was just a Texas businessman and most certainly not when he is making decisions that influence our lives and our futures; as Texans, Americans and global citizens.\nSince I am still rather cold and tired and just thankful I have power at the moment, I won\u2019t take away the joy of learning you will receive by a simple Google search of Ted Cruz. I have every confidence in your being able to find the evidence on your own without the need for spoonfed links.\n\nAnd by the way, I have yet to come across any opponent or even his fellow Republicans that I feel is less deserving of my vote than Ted Cruz. Truthfully, I am rather sad and a little angry that it has come to this point. I don\u2019t vote party lines, I vote issues and candidates. As for Cruz, sure I\u2019d let him come in out of the cold (When he gets back from Mexico) but I would make him sleep in the laundry room - after explaining in great detail why I will never vote for him.\n\n*Sorry keep losing cellular",

I'm willing to bet there are more blue people than red even in a lot of deep red states. I'm from Arizona. We have pockets of heavily conservative and/or religious people (I live in one, sigh) but I would guess that most people in the state as a whole are left leaning. People on the left just don't vote as often because 1. Voter suppression 2. They think it's pointless since they live in a deep red state 3. Red states are under educated. A lot of people just don't know how to vote or know much about politics.",

That is a lot like Trump and his followers, whose attachment to him has become so cultlike that every other Republican leader knows that challenging Trump is potential political suicide. The result: He, too, has no serious predators (I don\u2019t count a waffling Mitch McConnell). This reality, plus Trump\u2019s warped character, made him so reckless that he believed that he could shoot a whole branch of the U.S. government in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue and his base would stick with him. And he was right!\n\nMy deer and San Francisco\u2019s school board are local problems. The fact that one of our two national parties would stick with a leader who dispatched a mob to ransack the Capitol in hopes of overturning our last election is an acute national problem \u2014 a cancer, in fact. And like any cancer, the required treatment is going to be painful for the patient.\n\nFor me, that starts with getting rid of the filibuster in the Senate, granting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico statehood (they each have more U.S. citizens than Wyoming) and passing a new Voting Rights Act that forbids voter suppression. While that may sound hyperpartisan, it\u2019s the necessary, but not sufficient, remedy for America to regain its political health.\u201d\n\nFriedman argues that the republicans behave the way they do because they have no opposition.",

And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That\u2019s why you always feel smarter after a few beers.\u201d",

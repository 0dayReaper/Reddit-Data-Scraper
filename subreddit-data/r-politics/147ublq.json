It buys the votes of the defense industries all the way down to the workers in the factories making the equipment. As for the actual servicemen and women, we see very little of that money. In the 2020 election I reminded my coworkers that the previous president moved money from the Pentagon's budget to build his wall, which again was a ruse to move money from federal hands to private contractors who had donated to him. The money he moved? Taken from the budgets that were to expand medical care for families in military bases and cover costs to remodel and repair family quarters, much of which is falling apart and moldy. Both sides are to blame with the military industrial complex donating to both parties, but one party in particular loves to preach military service while stripping our benefits and shuffling that money to private hands.",

But to be such greedy pigs, especially with a country that so flagrantly violates human rights, is disgusting. Allow them back, but only after they fork over every LIV penny to a worthy charity. Most can earn their tour cards, but make them anyway. Phil was forced to fork over his ill-gotten $1M gains from the Dean Food deal. Becoming partners with murderers is infinitely worse.",

He is a former president that has knowledge of national secrets. He can't be around other prisoners where he could pass info on in any way.

Only approved people in and out at certain times with 100% being monitored at all times including any housekeepers and chefs. All his garbage would need to be inspected after it was thrown away. No phone, no internet. No food deliveries from any restaurants. \n\n\n\nPersonally I would vote for just locking his ass in the gold vault at fort Knox with a toilet and box of MREs and let him turn into fucking Golem and just be forgotten.",

An end goal, so one or the other can be declared a winner.  The people who want this 'civil war' are groups of lunatics who wouldn't have the knowledge or ability to sustain any sort of sustained conflict.  Instead, what this 'civil war' would end up looking like is a series of stochastic terrorist acts.  It will just be crime.  Lots of crime.  I'm not saying a civil war is not possible, but someone needs to convince me how they would do it.",

Literally.\n\nIf Trump just has to pay some gigantic fine or some shit and like have some sorta baby-hands punishment imposed, then....I mean he literally says things that are the polar opposite of true, so long as he *wants* it to be true. He forces the idea of straight up incorrect things being true.\n\nHe would *just* spin the argument that he was \"found guilty\", but remained completely free and that the lack of being behind actual bars *would then mean* the whole thing was a huge hoax because \"afterall, if those crimes were that serious, then the law states the punishment is pretty severe, but the Department of Justice **chose** not to pursue incarceration. Doesn't sound like they thought I committed any crimes and knew it was a hoax the whole time\".\n\nLiterally, the DoJ **has to** seek out incarceration. Some fine or literally **anything else** than *real* incarceration is going to allow him \"enough\" freedom to actually enflame supporters more and more and more and more and just keep pushing every possible envelope. He is literally \"give me an inch and I'll take 3,000 miles\" the person. The only answer to threats like that who committed those real actual crimes that would get anyone else shredded through the justice system is incarceration.\n\nI would argue this: *I am perfectly ok with him making those same exact claims that he would if he* ***didn't*** *get incarcerated, but actually did get incarcerated because at least then: the justice system* ***did its fucking job.***\n\nBro the dude had Pentagon plan information, US and other nations actual **defense capabilities**. If you don't incarcerate for that....then why the fuck do you incarcerate anyone?\n\nHe literally *attacked all of us with these actions. And that's just the documents case. J6 is* ***another*** *example.*",

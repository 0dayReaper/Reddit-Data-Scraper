Theres no chance of any remand or bond, there is no greater level of government supervision than what is already in place over him now. Any place Trump would ever want to go would require the mobilization of a large federal and local law enforcement  contingent , It cannot be done anonymously or \u201csecretly\u201d.  Trump is prohibited by law from driving a car as are all former Presidents under Secret Service protection and equally would not be permitted to board any random private plane , He requires advance declared travel plans the Secret Service needs for planning movement like that.",

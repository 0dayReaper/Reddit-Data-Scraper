There are still plenty of true believers, but I don't believe he actually turned conservatives against the FBI deep down.  They know this doesn't wash, he changed the story he told his own followers multiple times.  And after he didn't pardon any of the J6ers, people are wary of sticking their necks out for him.  His messaging apparatus tried to get them to show up to protests across the country for his New York arrest, and turnout was really thin.\n\nEven if he gets a bigger response in Florida, I don't think that indicates Republicans everywhere are as passionate about the guy as they used to be, or that he can expect a really large and enthusiastic voter turnout in a general.",

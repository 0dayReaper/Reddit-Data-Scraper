In those cases, if the DA actually prosecutes, it\u2019s still a minor slap on the wrist. And it can be a badge of honor. Nobody serious is talking about Bernie Sanders being a criminal/having a criminal record because of being arrested protesting in the 60s.  It saying it was a political stunt, but it\u2019s not something that ultimately hurt his political career. \n\n\nHere, we\u2019re talking about felony charges that carry a serious prison sentence. I would ***LOVE*** to see DeSatan turn himself in in California for kidnapping migrants as a publicity stunt. I would love to see the leopards actually eat his fucking face.",

One reason that Trump is so jarring to most people is that most people have never encountered someone as far gone as him. He is an extreme outlier in so many ways.  He was probably born broken, to some degree, into a family of extreme wealth and was spoiled rotten and never faced consequences for his negative actions.  He inherited enough money that he could indulge his grotesque pathological desires in any way he desired. He decided that he wanted to cosplay as a successful business man, seemingly because he desired the respect and adulation that he thought that would bring. Attention, respect and loyalty to him were what he desired. Money was just a tool and a vehicle to achieve that.  Its just tragic that one severely messed up person can have such a massive negative effect on a global scale.  Its mind boggling.",

Every time they say it was just a patriotic, peaceful protest I think to myself, \"oh that's right, because people smash windows, violently assault cops, and *smear shit on the walls* of government buildings when they peacefully protest\".\n\nThe shit smearing may be a relatively small detail when you add in the other stuff like the gallows they put up and the cops who died, but the fact that it's insignificant for that reason is all the more damning in my opinion.",

Ffs. \n\nWe still live in a country of law. Where there is a system of laws set up that unless Democrats control all three branches of government, they can't just *magically* enact laws that the Republicans disagree with! Just like this governor on one side of the country has zero way to imprison a governor on the other side of the country. How is that so difficult to understand?",

Aside from the fact that it\u2019s the right thing to do, Gavin is going to take this as far as possible in terms of prosecutions and consequences for both the private contractor and whoever sent them. He\u2019s been positioning himself for a POTUS run for a while and this plays into his plans. \n\nPersonally, I hope that we give these people a path to citizenship and sanctuary in my state. They were trafficked under the false pretense of finding work and a home, luckily CA has the programs and support to make this a reality and we desperately need people who are willing to work hard and build a life here. What an awful world we live in that we treat human beings like this, but I\u2019m hopeful that this miscalculation will have real consequences for the subhumans that think human trafficking for political points is a good idea.",

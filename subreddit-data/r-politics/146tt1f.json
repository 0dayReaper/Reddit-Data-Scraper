The fact of the matter is that the culture war wasn't near as big of a deal around the 2008 timeframe.  It was pre same-sex marriage and Obama didn't even openly support it during his first campaign.  Whenever the culture war is front and center, Republicans usually win as they did in 2000, 2004, and 2016.",

While there is a lot of migration into the state and into Charlotte and the Triangle, its not enough to offset those trends.

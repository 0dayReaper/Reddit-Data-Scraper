Maybe a review would have been done to make sure no outsiders got into the server, but that would be it. (And, in Clinton's case, since the State Department was hacked during her time in office, it wouldn't have really mattered either way.) But Republicans knew they had nothing with Benghazi, so they created a bunch of fake bullshit regarding the private server, then timed it to impact Clinton's presidential campaign as much as possible. Comey is a messy drama queen, so he happily played his part, and the media went right along and treated it as the biggest story of the election, without ever bothering to mention that it was all a bunch of partisan bullshit.

Not prosecuting Trump would be a clear threat to the legal system by putting a person above the law. The threat is from conservatives who want to codify the notion that the law exists only to constrain their enemies.",

The article goes on to state that \"when past presidents like Richard M. Nixon or Bill Clinton got in trouble, they defended themselves aggressively, but did not call the whole system into question. So, yes, without question, the prosecution of a former president on Federal charges does, if fact, present a threat to our legal system. If Trump is successful in rallying his adherents to support this kind of defense, the Rule of Law will lose it's luster as a central theme in our form of constitutional democracy.",

It's not partisanship that's the problem in this instance (though it is A problem in general). I think it's more an ongoing issue with the rich and powerful (of which Trump is both), playing games with the justice system until they can wiggle out of any consequences.\n\nIt's been ongoing for a while with a few people being thrown under the bus to use as examples (ie Martha Stewart, OJ). But Trump has by far been the most egregious.",

We should probably not pass judgement until that happens.

Most of the Federal charges against him (especially those that fall under the espionage act) typically involve 10 or more years of prison time.",

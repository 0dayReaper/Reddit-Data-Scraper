There\u2019s also nothing in the Constitution that specifically prohibits it. \n\nIt\u2019s an open constitutional question that has not come up. \n\nThe question is what takes precedent? Does the office of the Presidency and the will of the voters take the most precedence and he must be released from prison for the length of his term as President since he can\u2019t do the job from prison? And then he gets returned to prison after his term to finish out his sentence? Can he then self-pardon while President to not have to go back to prison?\n\nOr by nature of him being in prison, does that make him unable to carry out the duties of the office and therefore require his VP and cabinet to vote to invoke the 25th amendment and the VP assumes the office of the President? Can the VP/Acting-President then pardon the President at which time the President takes back over?\n\nThese are all untested questions and would create a massive constitutional crisis. There would be an extended period of time where no one is quite sure who actually holds the power of the Presidency. And any action taken by whoever holds the office for that time would be seen as \u201ctentative\u201d or \u201cconditional\u201d based on the results of whether they were ever legally the President in the first place. The problem is that a lot of things the President does can\u2019t be taken back. What if the President starts a war and it turns out he didn\u2019t have the power to do that because he wasn\u2019t actually President? You can\u2019t say \u201cedit-undo\u201d to that.",

That was fucking huge. This wasn't a close election. Americans were already on the edge of full blown rioting because of the pandemic and George Floyd. The George Floyd and women's marches would have looked like a concert being let out of a stadium compared to what would have ensued if it looked like Trump was going to be installed president against the will of Americans. \n\nThere was never a real chance at the time, and it ultimately all boils down to the fact that despite the bothsidesism from the media, Americans know these dudes are batshit. The military didn't support trump, the courts didn't, none of our institutions, supported his coup attempt. With that said, the chances are increasing. Trump laid the ground work for future maga republicans. Laws are being changed. Officials who would go against the national electorate are being instslled.",

The child\u2019s focus is on present events rather than being caught up in the past or future.\n\nE3 Self-Protective:  the child at this stage begins to develop some rudimentary self control.

He\u2019s caught up in perceiving the world in terms of punishments and rewards, but also incorporates the need \u201dnot to get caught.\u201d",

Raw materials shipped elsewhere for production. Little industry. They were on the wrong side of the revolutionary war, the wrong side of the civil war, the wrong side of civil rights, and remain opposed to the enlightenment principles that forged our country as they cling to their brand of Christianity. The only art and culture that comes from the south ironically comes from the people who were oppressed in that geography. Southern states have been mismanaged for decades and as a result have little to show for the industry and oil they do have because they've let the rich walk that money right out of where it was earned.",

What I\u2019m actually doing is saying that this hideous institution was perpetrated by more than one country, and let\u2019s not let others off the hook (also, let\u2019s just be accurate and precise with our language). \n\nLook, I\u2019m sorry that you didn\u2019t take my meaning correctly.

Most of the battles he engaged in ended in defeat. Bragg was extremely unpopular with both the officers and ordinary men under his command, who criticized him for numerous perceived faults, including poor battlefield strategy, a quick temper, and overzealous discipline.\u201d \n\nHe was an incompetent failure in every sense. The ONLY reason anyone could possibly get behind this guy is because of his ideals. Supporting Bragg is just a slightly more socially acceptable way to say \u201cI\u2019m racist and I\u2019m proud.\u201d",

Like my parents always were very Republican but probably more libertarians. Anyway. George Floyd happened and he was aghast. For a brief moment he could see the bias, still wrote most of it off, but he was deeply troubled and wanted justice.\n\nThen months later, we are talking about BLM (I was fairly effective at getting them off the All Lives Matter nonsense) and he says, \"I'm not sure he [George Floyd] really suffocated. He just had a heart attack.\" In essence, saying it was all a big accident.\n\nI'm just floored by this. But not surprised. He is inundated with Fox all day. It warped his mind around what happened. Same with Jan 6th. I remember him texting me that day that Trump should resign and that he was disgusted. Months later, he starts talking about vote cultivating down in Philly (which when he explains what he means is really just getting people to vote) and crap like that. And he also downplays the insurrection as being peaceful.\n\nAnd while I know why this happened, it still blows my mind. It's like in the moment he sees it for what it is. Then the machines twists and twists until that is all forgotten. And it just sucks.",

One person in this group specifically said that he hated Trump and the Republican Party because they don\u2019t act like Christians. The difference between them and the Republicans cited in this poll is that these people I know don\u2019t tune into any of the right wing media. Those particular outlets almost seem to coordinate with her messaging, and the politicians followed their messaging. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were a group text in which they coordinate their messaging.",

They didn\u2019t preach it in the Sermons, but it was overtly \u2019implied\u2019. \nIt became that members of the congregation, flat out repeated conspiracy theories, spoke ill of President Biden\u2026\u2026.. we just went there less and less. There are still good people there, they just aren\u2019t strong enough to leave. I won\u2019t judge them, but hubby and I , in good conscience, could not be part of that. We vowed that we would never just go to one church, nor one religion. We are inclusive to all. As much as I can\u2019t stand Trump, I would never start up or take part in a conversation against him AT CHURCH.  We also respect those who don\u2019t \u2018believe\u2019 as we do. I simply cannot understand how people can become so hateful. It is definitely a Cult atmosphere\u2026.. and if we are to believe that there is an \u2018anti-Christ, then it has to be obvious that Donald tRump MUST be it.\nJust my humble old age opinion!!",

How does Trump running 3rd party and splitting the Republican vote end in less electoral college votes for Biden?\n\nYes, you are correct that to win the presidency, a candidate needs 270 electoral votes ... but, you are assuming that 3 candidates would split the vote in a way that no candidate reached the magic 270 number.\r  \n\r  \nThat would never happen, because Trump can only win states that the republicans will win anyway. Trump is not stealing any states away from Biden.\r  \n\r  \nLooking at the 2020 results, Biden won 306 to Trump's 232.\r  \n\r  \nWhat states that Biden won will go to either Trump or the Republican candidate?\r  \n\r  \nTake a swing state like Wisconsin. Biden won the state 49.4% to Trump's 48.8%. Let's assume Biden retains his 49% (hell, you could even assume Biden slips a little to 47%-48%). Trump and the Republican candidate will split Trump's prior 48.8%, only increasing Biden's margin of victory.\r  \n\r  \nTrump running 3rd party does not increase the chances of Biden failing to reach 270 electoral votes ... if anything it drastically increases the chances of Biden winning in a landslide because neither the Republican nor Trump would have the firepower to win battleground states outright because Trump and the Republican candidate would be fighting each other over the same voters.",

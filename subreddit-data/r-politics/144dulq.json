Republicans say the legislation, dubbed the Freights First Act, would help ease supply chain challenges and improve business conditions. Still, the measure would likely frustrate the passenger rail corporation.\n\n'Railway bottlenecks and time delays at critical junctures create empty shelves in stores and higher prices for consumers,' Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), the bill\u2019s sponsor and a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said. 'We should find ways to cut red tape to benefit our supply chain instead of providing special treatment to poor stewards of the people\u2019s money like Amtrak.'\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, pushed for legislation in the last Congress that would have given Amtrak the ability to enforce its preference rights over freight railroads in court.\"\n\n[Read more here](https://about.bgov.com/news/supply-chain-woes-spur-gop-push-to-cut-amtraks-track-rights?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_medium=bgov)**.**\n\n\\[edited for formatting\\]",

But we really only have one main line across the country and it would be difficult to try to give VIA passenger trains priority. \n\nThe CP100 and 101 run across the country daily and much of the NA economy relies on those trains arriving on time (think stuff like JIT auto manufacturing). So they receive priority over all other trains and never slow down outside of safety considerations. But cross-country VIA trains can be over a day late sometimes and I\u2019ve been on trains between Ottawa and Toronto with delays of like 25-30%. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize that Amtrak had special priority. I know that it would be a blow to passenger service to take that away, but that\u2019s just a practical consideration we made here a long time ago. I wonder if some compromise could be reached.",

                            "comment": "Yes, I recognize that, having looked into the situation after reading the article. I feel like everybody thinks I\u2019m saying that Amtrak should just bow down, which I don\u2019t think is that case at all. \n\nWhen I mention compromise, I\u2019m thinking of the railroads building more siding and bypass infrastructure to meet with the demand on the rail lines. Or some other solution I\u2019m not equipped to think about. \n\nAmtrak has, and deserves their priority on the lines. There is also an economic interest in ensuring that freight is delivered on time.\n\nCanada couldn\u2019t give priority to passengers any more than US should give priority to freight. The NA car industry especially relies on the fact that we can send a train across the country in 4 days and do so every day, on schedule 99% of the time. The American side relies on these trains as well, because that could obviously not happen using American lines.\n\nAs the rail lines get more congested with both freight and passengers, there will be an economic cost. The economy shouldn\u2019t take priority above people\u2019s lives, but in another 10 or 20 years, it could become a real issue.\n\nAnd so I wonder if there may be solutions beyond \u201cMe first!\u201d That is all. I doubt there are any easy solutions to the problem, but like to think it\u2019s worth considering.",

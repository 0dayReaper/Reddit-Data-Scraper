It would be a terrible look for the country and a logistical nightmare. If it isn't finished by the time Trump could take office in January 2025, is not made clear if a president could constitutionally pardon themselves.\n\nThey also would likely want at least a conviction before a potential Republican nominee comes in and pardons him. Which seems likely to happen if a Republican candidate wins in 2024.",

However the Democratic Party does not have a simple majority in the House. They would need at least 6 Republicans to vote to disqualify Trump. \n\nTechnically they don't have a simple majority in the Senate either they would need all 3 independent Senators to vote to disqualify as well as all 48 members to agree.\n\nImportantly though Congress can also vote to remove the disqualification by 2/3s vote in both houses, which while unlikely isn't impossible. \n\nAlso the only time Section 3 was invoked Congress had to vote to disqualify each time the prospective Senator was voted into Congress.",

In this instance, the prosecutors can appeal to the Southern District of Florida (who might punt the decision to the 11th Circuit of the Federal Courts) to have Judge Cannon simply removed from the case so that she is not presiding over this case.\n\nThe second removal is what you mentioned, where a judge would be impeached and banned from being a judge in general.\n\nI believe OP was discussing the first kind of removal, not the second.",

In fact, the southern district of Florida has a binding resolution based on a previous case where if a judge shows clear bias in either way toward a defendant must recuse themselves. If they do not, the appeals court will reassign the case. Since she has already shown a bias toward Trump and been admonished for it, if she doesn't recuse herself the appeals court will do it for her. There's no way she's staying on as the judge for this case, the system won't allow it.",

And it's generally true because one of the first things you learn in actually practicing is that it isn't about being an argumentative dick if you actually want to accomplish anything.   After 20+ years in practice, I've lost count of the number of times I've heard a layperson tell me they always wanted to be a lawyer and would be great at it because they love to argue.  Good litigation is about finding common ground with your opponent on things not worth arguing about, and setting up what you can't agree on for the judge to decide.  And to do it right, you present what you want in a way that makes the result you want seem like the right result.",

If he does get elected, all pending court cases involving him will be temporarily suspended because of his duties as President. All of these cases will be put on hold until his term is up in 2029.\n\nWhich brings up the point.... We now live in a time where becoming the president will be used as a valid reason to delay multiple pending court cases ranging from civil lawsuits all the way up to a federal indictment. That has to be a first.\n\nA second point would be that it's very possible if Trump loses and the GOP takes the White House, the GOP president could unilaterally pardon Trump on almost every pending case (assuming he's willing to plead guilty first). Or, if Trump does win and actually agrees to step down towards the end of his 4 year term, he could resign his last year of office, allow his VP to become President and get pardoned that way too.",

If the judge who halted an investigation against him happens to be the one presiding over his conviction, there's much less of a way to weasel out some kind of hoax narrative.\n\nProsecutors only really need one count to nail him.\n\nIn fact, in regards to the long term healing of this country, this may be the best case scenario.",

Are you serious!!  This shouldn\u2019t be a thing!  \n\nWhat\u2019s happening in SCOTUS with conservative judges and now this matter with Aileen Cannon is just unreal.  There should be clear rules on what you can and cannot do, and if you have a connection to the person involved in anyway, in this case appointment and blundering a previous case with the same parties involved, you should be part of any further cases. Period.  \n\nThe prosecution has no choice but to wait because those crafting rules never imagined this scenario.  They expected everyone to do the right thing, which is weird because people don\u2019t always do the right thing.  \n\nAileen Cannon has a lifetime appointment and her previous actions will likely put her in the conservative running for their next SCOTUS pick.  She can\u2019t be made to recuse and she cannot be fired.  She can only be impeached and that ain\u2019t happening with crazy town running congress.  \n\nShe\u2019s got a finger on the scale.

Their podcast is *CAFE Insider*. It is paywalled, but Preet's [podcast](https://cafe.com/stay-tuned-podcast/) *Stay Tuned with Preet* also snippets about half of the content from each episode and posts it for free on their feed each week. Both offer excellent legal analysis. I've followed Insider since its inception, and they rarely go wrong.\n\nWhile we're at it, subscribe to *The Lawfare Podcast* [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/lawfare-podcast), which is IMO the best legal analysis out there and drops daily with very niche episodes. They've been the best listen through all of Trump's legal troubles, and are free.",

Conmen like Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump are constantly throwing around threats of lawsuits, but notice how rarely they actually back them up.\n\nhonest people don't actually have to threaten lawsuits and then back away. If there is nothing damaging to be found in discovery, there is no reason not to just go ahead and actually sue.",

I can confidently say that Dominion is simply bringing these suits separately to create legal precedent in order to bring the same suit to sitting senators and former president Trump.",

Wedge, Brian Tomlinson, and Peggy Ryan have published pieces on www.AmericanThinker.com that falsely accuse US Dominion Inc., Dominion Voting Systems, Inc., and Dominion Voting Systems Corporation (collectively \u201cDominion\u201d) of conspiring to steal the November 2020 election from Donald Trump. \n\n&gt; These pieces rely on discredited sources who have peddled debunked theories about Dominion\u2019s supposed ties to Venezuela, fraud on Dominion\u2019s machines that resulted in massive vote switching or weighted votes, and other claims falsely stating that there is credible evidence that Dominion acted fraudulently.\n\n&gt; These statements are completely false and have no basis in fact. Industry experts and public officials alike have confirmed that Dominion conducted itself appropriately and that there is simply no evidence to support these claims.\n\n&gt; It was wrong for us to publish these false statements. We apologize to Dominion for all of the harm this caused them and their employees. \n\n&gt; We also apologize to our readers for abandoning 9 journalistic principles and misrepresenting Dominion\u2019s track record and its limited role in tabulating votes for the November 2020 election.

The whole point of such a lawsuit is that there is damage to your reputation.\n\nIf somebody says something that's not true about you but everybody takes it as hyperbole or nobody remembers it, that's less damaging. But here, we've got people traveling to Washington DC from the other side of the country and willing to get themselves arrested partially because they believed Trump and company's claims about Dominion.",

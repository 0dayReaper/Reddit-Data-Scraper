I will never vote for a Republican or Libertarian, or any variety right wing nut job for that matter, ever again.      \n\nIt\u2019s been generations since the GOP did anything that actually made the lives of common Americans better.  The next few election cycles will be really interesting.  I wonder if enough people are outraged enough to turn the tide of fascism that is quickly approaching.  Have enough MAGA idiots and hateful boomers died of covid and old age?  Will the Independents plan swing left like they did in the last midterms?  Are millennial and Gen Z voters pissed off enough to fulfill their civic duties?  Are women and LGBTQ+ frightened and angry enough to demand our rights be returned to us, and for real this time no takebackseys?  I could go on for mma y different groups who continually suffer under Republican policies but you get it.  \n\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.  We only have maybe one or two more elections to get this right or we can kiss it all goodbye.",

Literally ZERO things we can point to and say \"good thing conservatives defeated progressives on that.\" Every conservative accomplishment was some bigoted or selfish bullshit that had to or needs to be undone.",

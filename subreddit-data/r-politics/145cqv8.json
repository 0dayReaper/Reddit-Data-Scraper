I can\u2019t remember the exact year but around 2015/2016 is when Fiber was announced and because of the current regulations and infrastructure, AT&amp;T began litigation and political policy shaping to prevent Google from using the same poles, etc. So, it was either fight in courts, etc. or build new telecom poles.\n\nNot a coincidence that the politicians with the lowest standards and ease of being bought out also happened to be the people that vote Anti LGBTQIA+.",

Which calls in to question what he said before, he knows having them is a bad thing, he shouldn\u2019t of had them.   \n  \nWhich also makes me question if the president can declassify stuff with his mind, so the stuff Biden had was ok, because he, as president, can also just declassify them with his mind right?  \n  \nBathroom is better than a garage because it can lock, but what about the boxes on the stage, can a stage lock.  \n  \nCalling into question Fox\u2019s take on this is as well, it doesn\u2019t matter trump showed the documents to that guy, the guy was an American. So American\u2019s automatically have security clearance?  \n  \nSome people are amazing, mental gymnastics are really really hard to do.",

I used to be an appellate chief in the 11th Circuit (where Florida is) and I litigated a few appeals where we asked the court of appeals to order a judge to recuse.   \n\n\n2/ Altho a judge's behavior in court generally doesn't form the basis for recusal, the 11th Circuit has ordered \"reassignment\" where a judge leans so heavily for a defendant they call their objectivity in the eyes of the public into question. This is from US v. Martin  \n\n\n3/ This is persuasive authority that Judge Cannon must step aside if the case falls to her as a permanent assignment. Her court &amp; certainly the 11th won't tolerate the damage it would do to their credibility if she failed to voluntarily recuse. \r  \n\n\n4/ It is not clear Cannon is permanently assigned to the case. If she is, it's extremely unlikely it stays with her and as a last resort, DOJ will challenge her participation and win.",

The only published precedent I've seen on that issue from the 11th circuit regarded a judge who had sentenced a client in a case, the appellate court had reversed and remanded, the judge had re-sentenced and the appellate court AGAIN reversed and remanded. As bad as Cannon's rulings were, it doesn't seem to rise to that standard--which means the question is open.",

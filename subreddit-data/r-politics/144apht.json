The police (the \"real local police\") sent out a message to let people know.\n\nAnd then the complaining began. The same we've been hearing: Last I checked we live in America, we're not sheep,  I bet the people who listen to this wore masks. The usual stuff, but more interesting, was that it was in defiance of a notice from the police and a request for cooperation.\n\nSo, there's something happening more openly where even local police are being confronted more.  I think we're seeing it's not so much about who is doing the enforcement so long as they agree with it.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; In recent months, the former president has equated the FBI with &amp;quot;The Gestapo.&amp;quot; He&amp;#039;s told the public that the bureau is led by &amp;quot;Marxist Thugs.&amp;quot; He&amp;#039;s condemned the FBI as &amp;quot;Corrupt&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Crooked.&amp;quot; He&amp;#039;s described FBI officials as &amp;quot;Mobsters&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Real threat to democracy.&amp;quot; He&amp;#039;s slammed the FBI as the &amp;quot;Fake Bureau of Investigation,&amp;quot; before accusing the bureau of secretly paying people to &amp;quot;Steal&amp;quot; the 2020 election from him, as part of the FBI&amp;#039;s plot to &amp;quot;Rig&amp;quot; the election and &amp;quot;Illegally change&amp;quot; the results.\n\n&gt; As recently as two months ago, Trump even endorsed congressional Republicans defunding federal law enforcement.\n\n&gt; Fourteen years later, does Trump genuinely believe that federal law enforcement has been infiltrated by fascists? Probably not.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/144byzg/trump_ups_the_ante_condemns_fascists_in_us_law/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688160 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **FBI**^#1 **Trump**^#2 **He&amp;#039;s**^#3 **year**^#4 **former**^#5",

For a couple weeks after this, he kept blowing up my phone with text messages and voicemails about how he only bit the cop because he was scared and that it was okay because he handed the cop a paper towel afterwards.\n\nI kept telling him it didn't matter if I agreed with him at all, because I'm not the judge and I'm not on the jury. He still kept pleading his case, often in all caps and always with poorly thought-out arguments. I can't get over how much Trump's innocence rants sound like my old friend with the traumatic brain injury who bit a cop.",

            "comment": "We need to stop refusing to charge politicians when the commit crimes that would see an ordinary citizen facing immediate arrest and jail time because it's \"too political\".   By continuing to shield politicians from being held accountable, we are telling people that becoming a politician gives them a universal \"Get out of Jail Free\" card and carte blanche to do whatever they want, leading politicians to become more and more brazen about their crimes as they try to figure out where the red line is, or even if there's a red line at all.\n\nDeSantis used Florida taxpayer money to transport immigrants from Texas to various locations, under false pretenses, literally leaving them out in the cold.  He has admitted to and bragged about doing this.   This man should have been charged with multiple counts of human trafficking and/or kidnapping charges, endangering the welfare of children, and misappropriation of state funds to say the very least.  \n\nGeorge Santos' identity cannot even be independently verified because literally every detail of his past has proven to be a lie.  The man should be at the very least investigated for possible identity theft, while also being charged with falsifying the multiple records he needed to forge in order to run for office in the first place.  \n\nOf course, the list of charges Donald Trump should be facing is way too long to list here.  But to focus on just one of them, multiple people have served months or even years of jail time for *accidentally* mishandling a single classified document.   Not only has Trump not yet served even a second behind bars, but he is allowed to walk and travel the world freely despite having *boxes* of documents and the resources and ability to sell them to foreign governments despite openly admitting to taking the documents and an increasing amount of evidence pointing to the possibility at least some of them have already been sold.\n\nClarence Thomas has been involved in so much bribery that the value of the gifts *that we know of* exceeds the salary he has earned since being confirmed to the bench.  Since then, multiple members of the Supreme Court have also been exposed for engaging in practices that are at best shady as well.  However, there is absolutely no appetite to actually call for the impeachment of any of them.  \n\nThese aren't just policy decisions made by government officials that people disagree with, think are \"bad\" or even \"cruel\" but would still fall under the execution of their duties.  These are outright criminal acts that would put any ordinary citizen in jail, probably for life.   They are far from the first politicians to engage in criminal activity, but this is really the first crop of politicians that are brazen about it and all but challenge the population to do something about it.  \n\nThe longer we continue to not *immediately* investigate, charge, and remove corrupt politicians from office, the more that people view a career in politics as a \"do what you want and get away with it\" badge.   And the more that that happens, the worse it's going to get.   Our AGs (Not only Garland, but at the state level as well) need to stop tiptoeing around politicians and stop being too scared of \"looking politicial\" and start actually charging these politicians the same way that they wouldn't hesitate to charge your average joe.",

Seeing someone like DeSantis go from \"Governor of Florida\" to \"Inmate #2830284B\" would be a great way to start cleaning up the corruption real quick.  These people would be significantly less likely to do the \"fucking around\" part in the first place if the \"find out\" part had some damn teeth to it.  \n\n&gt;Public opinion appears to be more important than the law. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem.  Either they have somehow become genuinely concerned over the opinions of those who support criminals that are going to dismiss any investigation as a \"political witch hunt\" anyway, or they figured out that they can use the excuse of \"appearing too political\" as an excuse to simply not do their jobs.  \n\n&gt;The AGs, unfortunately, have to deal with the insurmountable challenge of misinformation and on-line threats of violence. \n\nThe AGs have more than enough resources at their disposal to sift out the misinformation.   Start tracing threats of violence back to the source and start throwing some people in jail for it and watch the threats dry up real quick.   It's one thing to threaten individual people or even corporations and put them in unwinnable positions, but try pulling that stuff with the US government and let me know how it works out for you.  \n\n&gt;The sources of misinformation cannot be disabled because they are too profitable.\n\nThis is a sad but true statement.  :(",

For better or for worse, people use the terms \"trafficking\" and \"smuggling\" interchangably in everyday conversation, mostly because there's little practical difference between the two.   There may be significant *legal* differences between the two that would matter in a court of law, but those differences are both nonexistent in a practical sense and irrelevant to your average joe.

Because it is still very much illegal what he's doing regardless of the name you give it. I guess with everything going on with Trump, the DOJ has probably assessed that it would likely look really bad --no matter how legitimate-- to be looking to indict a *second* popular Republican running for President. \n\nBut you are right, in casual conversation the two are definitely used interchangeably and understandably so, and I don't mean to come off like I'm splitting hairs.",

But if the laws are not blocked by the courts government officials can enforce them.\n\nGeorge Wallace, governor of alabama, is famous for physically standing in the doorway of university of alabama to block black students from being allowed inside after courts ruled segregation was unconstitutional. He did this with authority from the state legislature and had hundreds of state cops there to help him. The national guards had to physically move him out of the way and hold him to allow the students inside. He was not arrested because he was doing this as an official act as governor and authorized by the state legislature to do anything possible to stop desegregation.\n\nThis is why qualified immunity is so bad and more people need to understand this.

DeSantis is not the governor of Texas and it would be difficult to argue that the people of Florida had any interest in migrants outside their state.  The legislature approving his plan or passing laws appropriating funds doesn't seem to change that his role of governor doesn't include bussing migrants that were never in his state or headed to his state.",

When a governor or president does something illegal like spies on his running mate, accepts a bribe or cheats in an election those things are done in their personal capacity for their own gain and violate the law governing their position. Because Desantis was authorized to do these things by the florida legislature he is acting as the state of florida when he does them. It is the government of the state of florida that is committing the crimes not Desantis personally. Just like when a cop kills someone innocent 99 times out of 100 the actions were within the authority granted to them by the city so the city is the one who pays the lawsuit not the cop. You cant arrest a government entity, you can only sue them and that is the only remedy here",

It does have an indirect effect.\n\nThe entire point of gerrymandering is to dilute the vote of the opposing party at the legislative level.   Once enough people are affected and think their votes don't matter, they stay home.   This means that a gubernatorial candidate suffers because if it weren't for the gerrymandering, more people would likely come out and vote for them. \n\nThis absolutely could matter in close races.",

Since part of the process involves identifying a US sponsor, the program merely transports these immigrants to the state where those sponsors are located.   Both the administration and the immigrants themselves knew exactly where they were going.  \n\nDeSantis isn't doing that.  By your own words, he's merely \"stiffing one to the dems\" by getting random immigrants onto buses under false pretenses, dropping them off with little to no warning given to the people at the destination, giving them no assistance in figuring out where they were supposed to go, intentionally migrating people with court dates to places thousands of miles away so they miss their court dates and get deported, kicking them out into the cold, and saying \"good luck, you're on your own.\"\n\nNice try with the whataboutism, though.

Has that been alleged by any credible source, ever? Like, if they had a sponsor, the assumption is that they knew they were being moved, as opposed to the ones who publicly stated they were misled into getting onto flights by others. But I get how being on that high horse named Bullshit might have kept you from seeing that.\n\nAlso, it is the federal government's responsibility, according to Republicans, to deal with them in some manner, exactly what the administration was doing. This didn't include dumping them at an airport or bus station to absolutely fend for themselves in places not prepared for them to arrive.\n\nIt's like you see two people walk out of the store with TVs and think that's all that matters while ignoring that one paid with a stolen credit card and the other paid in cash they earned. One is fine, one is a criminal, but they both got TVs so it must be the same and why are you arresting the one guy, he obviously did the same thing the other guy did.",

((https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/05/24/desantis-president-resign-to-run-florida-governor/)\n\nAnd the Florida law in effect when he filed for candidacy, before he signed the new bill, says \n\n&gt; **(4)(f) The failure of an officer who qualifies for federal public office to submit a resignation pursuant to this subsection constitutes an automatic irrevocable resignation, effective immediately, from the office he or she presently holds.**\" ((https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2020/99.012))\n\nNow, that section of the law is a big wall-o-text, but if you read it, \"qualifies for federal public office\" means qualifying to seek the office, not winning the election for that office:\n\n&gt; (4)(a) Any officer who qualifies for federal public office must resign from the office he or she presently holds if the terms, or any part thereof, run concurrently with each other.\n\n&gt; (b) The resignation is irrevocable.\n\n&gt; (c) The resignation must be submitted at least 10 days before the first day of **qualifying for the office he or she intends to seek.**",

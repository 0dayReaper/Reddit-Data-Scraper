            "comment": "There's Erik Prince's name again, working closely with trump to undermine democracy in the US. Up until now, I did not realize Prince was working with Project Veritas. Here are some juicy excerpts from the article:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;...to gain access to their targets and gather dirt to sabotage the reputations of people andorganizations considered threats to the agenda of President Donald J. Trump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Prosecutors also sought communications, documents or financial records tied to Erik Prince, the international security consultant, as well as former operatives who worked for the conservative group Project Veritas and its founder. Mr. Prince and Mr. Seddon are longtime associates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In 2017, Mr. Seddon was recruited to join Project Veritas by Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater Worldwide and brother of Betsy DeVos, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary at the time. According to people with knowledge of Mr. Prince\u2019s role, he believed Mr. Seddon could turn Project Veritas into a more professional intelligence gathering operation.\n\n  \nAnd here we have trump waging war against his own National Security Advisor and the FBI, much like a Russian asset would:\n\n&gt;Soon afterward, Mr. Seddon was engineering an effort to discredit perceived enemies of Mr. Trump inside the U.S. government, including a planned sting operation in 2018 against Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time, H.R. McMaster. He also helped set up operations to secretly record F.B.I. employees and other government officials.",

But its use of professional intelligence-gathering techniques to try to manipulate the politics of several states showed a greater sophistication than more traditional political \u201cdirty tricks\u201d operations.\n\n&gt;It also showed a level of paranoia in some ultraconservative Republican circles that the electoral map in the United States might be changing to their disadvantage. \n\nWhy are these ultra-wealthy people becoming so crazy and unhinged?",

Mueller brought charges against three former Trump campaign officials \u2014 Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. Manafort and Gates have both pleaded not guilty. Papadopoulos accepted a plea bargain, which detailed extensive contact between himself and various individuals claiming they had connections to the Kremlin.\n\nDespite denials from the campaign and the White House, it is now clear that members of the Trump campaign interacted with Russians at least 32 times throughout the campaign. (There are at least 20 known meetings.) Knowledge of these communications went to the highest levels of Donald Trump\u2019s operation \u2014 both Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, two of the campaign\u2019s three managers, were aware of it.",

Manafort had some shadier business dealings with those in the Russian orbit. \n\nI\u2019m not saying trump isn\u2019t a corrupt asshole or that his campaign didn\u2019t have communication or at least share interest with the Russians. But the idea that the Russian government is pulling the strings of the Republican Party is a CONSPIRACY THEORY. I saw a comment the other day with hundreds of upvotes claiming the reason Lindsay Graham became a Trump sycophant was Russia blackmail from the GOP server. It\u2019s silly and just as unfounded as MAGA conspiracies.",

But, in a world inured to the shocks and outrages generated by Trump, it\u2019s worth pausing to acknowledge the jaw-dropping nature of the charges against him. Revelations start at the top of the forty-four-page filing and keep coming: The former President of the United States retained nuclear secrets and classified war plans for how to respond to a foreign attack. He kept top-secret information about the military capabilities of other countries. He stashed this information in his bathroom. In his bedroom. And even in a Mar-a-Lago ballroom. (There are pictures!) He misled his own lawyer in order to cover up his possession of these documents. He suggested that documents be hidden or destroyed, and blithely lied about their existence when challenged.",

Given the circumstances under which he was flaunting them, I\u2019d imagine he showed them to many more people.  Also, it mentions how they smuggled dozens of boxes onto Trump\u2019s plane to Bedminster after cherry picking a subset to turn over to the feds.  Not much else is mentioned about those in the indictment, so I\u2019m curious if we\u2019ll be seeing another indictment based on NJ in the future concerning those.",

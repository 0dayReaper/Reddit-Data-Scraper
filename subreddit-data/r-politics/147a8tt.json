Morality is not defined by people's actions but by whose side they are on. We are good, therefore everything we do is good. Our enemies are bad therefore everything they do is bad. Words and concepts that have a positive emotional connotation are to be associated with people on our side, those with a bad connotation to the other side, regardless of semantics.\n\nIn this way, you essentially speak a different language without thinking about it. You can effortlessly \"make up crap on the fly\" because words are effectively meaningless and that isn't a problem because you're not trying to convey meaningful information. You're just affirming loyalty and broadcasting your allegiance by subjectively associating their emotional subtext.",

The patient had stated he had implanted monitoring device in his throat and was trying all sorts of things to get it out. They tried every medication on him and nothing could change this thought process so finally the doctor said how about I x-ray your throat? Would that prove it to you that it\u2019s not there? The patient agreed that would prove it. X-ray was completed and of course showed no implant. When showed to the patient he stated of course it\u2019s not there I swallowed it and now it\u2019s in my stomach. So on and on it goes. You cannot change a fixed delusion instead you have to figure out why the person needs it so badly to feel safe.  Why do they need to believe someone is going to rescue them. I think the reason might be different for each person. Half of our country is so distraught and fearful they are willing to join a cult to escape reality. I\u2019ve thought about this a lot and even though it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow I think we have to look upon most of them ( the non 1 %) with pity as they are uneducated in many ways and fearful of the future and cannot cope unless they have a literal break from reality. I wish our media would focus on trying to heal verses trying to separate.",

At first glance that seems like a similar concept to what you described but the additional layer of separation from any specific characteristic makes it easier to avoid what they perceive as negative labels. In other words, in their minds it's more abstract than simply being racist. Most Trump voters don't think of themselves as racist, they just like it when someone pisses off black people. To you and me that sounds like the same thing but to them it is the difference between racist and not racist because they have a ready made excuse to justify the racist tendencies. The reason I don't like them is not because they're black it's because they're on food stamps, or are from the big city, or vote Democrat, etc. The mental separation is an important piece of the puzzle. \n\nTrump lets them feel like they're on the \"good\" side of whatever line is being drawn without having to go through the work of drawing the line and sorting people themselves, which then allows them to say it's not about the line at all, it's about whatever made up bullshit is making the rounds that week. This is how they end up saying so many contradictory things without batting an eye.",

Further, he speaks to the narrative that there is a silent majority in the country that is being persecuted by the politically correct elites; but I had no idea this would make up 80% of the republican party. Honestly, I thought it would be around 20%.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t see how a fighting spirit and/or taking down the bogeyman can cause this level of loyalty.

            "comment": "It helps me understand these headlines by reflecting on my past. For the first 35-37 years of my life, I was raised in a Fox News household. Before Trump, I was a down ballot \u201cR\u201d voter. I watched and listened to Glenn Beck, Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Sean Hannity daily. I was convinced that \u201cDemocrats want to abolish the constitution, end democracy, and turn this country in to a communistic fiefdom\u201d. Around 2014, 2015, my career really took off. I was super lucky to have a family that pushed me in that direction. I was making more money than most of my friends and creeping up on how much my parents made. I was always spreading the love! I bought the food, the drinks, I hosted the parties\u2026I wanted to share with my circle! I started to question \u201cis my work (I wasn\u2019t really working any harder than anyone else in my circle) really \u201cworth\u201d what I was receiving? Then I had the epiphany of \u201chey, everyone in your circle is firmly in the middle to upper-middle class, how bad is my compensation compared to folks in the lower class?\u201d and that started really making me question the things Fox was telling me. I started seeking out alternative sources of information. I actually started listening to some of my \u201cleft leaning\u201d friends instead of regurgitating what Beck told me to say when I heard the term \u201cprogressive\u201d. Then \u201cgrab \u2018em by the pussy\u201d happened and I thought \u201cthere is no way he wins the primary with that on tape\u201d. He wins, (I fucking voted for Gary Johnson) and I thought \u201cthere is no way Republicans in congress actually work with him and he is a lame duck from day 1\u201d. Imagine my surprise when all the \u201cR Leaders\u201d bowed to the messiah. That was the end for me. I couldn\u2019t I\u2019m good conscious vote for folks who in any way supported that. Ultimately, this pushed me even further left but that\u2019s another story. \n\nTLDR: Folks consuming right-to-Alt Right media view Democrats as \u201cEvil, communist, Marxist, Leninist, Anti-Catholic, American hating Nazis (without irony) who feel that voting for anyone with a D next to their name is akin to voting for the devil. An incarcerated Trump is better than the most middle-of-the-road Democrat\u201d. If you put this article through that lens, you will see why 80% are still on board. \n\nThis does not surprise me.",

Ive been a democrat since Bush vs. Gore back when I was in high school. I was a republican before that but just because my dad was. I had not liked much of the rhetoric on the campaign trail. I felt like republicans were becoming too religious. I was a catholic but i had always been taught religion should be left out of government. Then i saw what happened in that election and i could see it wasn\u2019t right. Things were not working the way they were supposed to. Its just been a downhill spiral for the party since then. But it feels like someone is either going to see it or they wont. Clearly the things that pushed us away had no effect on them. I have no idea what to do about that.

I said, there's no fuckin' way he will be president after those comments.  I too was shocked he won.  \n\nWhen I watched those primaries, I pretty much universally disagreed with all GOP stances, except capital punishment and gun rights.  I do remember thinking that I didn't like John Kasich's politics, but if he was elected president we would be okay.  That was the same feeling that I had with Romney and McCain.  Trump however... horrified me.  All one had to do was listen to what he said and they would have figured out that Trump wasn't fit for the Presidency.",

Trump is unfit for office (hell he's unfit even if not convicted), but a convicted felon should still be allowed to run.\n\nFrankly I'd say once a felon has served their time, they really shouldn't have any restrictions provided they're not a danger to anyone.

            "comment": "They're partially right, for the wrong reasons - \n\nA felony conviction should not preclude the ability to run for office. This is an extremely important protection against political abuse of the justice system, to prevent a majority party or party in power from pushing through bullshit charges and getting a conviction through a rigged court to prevent any meaningful opposition.  (This is clearly not the case with the Trump indictment, as much as he keeps trying to claim it is).\n\nIdeally, voters would be able to determine from there if the conviction is meaningful and/or speaks poorly enough to the character of the candidate to not vote for them.\n\nThe exception is the Espionage Act, which specifically includes clauses to prohibit holding public office if convicted; however, that clause has never really been tested in such circumstances and may or may not hold up constitutionally. Given several of the charges stem from the Espionage Act, any of those convictions *should* prohibit him from becoming President or holding any other public office.",

And it provides $60 billion in grants and tax credits for clean-energy investments and projects to clean up pollution in disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe biggest chunk of money from the legislation goes to clean energy, with $128 billion in tax credits over the next decade for businesses shifting to greener power sources, such as solar, says Brian O\u2019Callaghan, an economist at the University of Oxford, UK. That\u2019s about 13% of today\u2019s renewable-energy market. \u201cThe scale of this bill is enormous, particularly on energy,\u201d O\u2019Callaghan says.\n\nMore than $60 billion is slated to go to US manufacturing of clean-energy technologies, such as solar panels and electric vehicles, and billions more are included in tax credits for decarbonization, clean-vehicle purchases and household-level efficiency improvements \u2014 making this the largest climate investment in US history.\n\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biden-signs-historic-climate-bill-as-scientists-applaud/#:~:text=More%20than%20%2460%20billion%20is,largest%20climate%20investment%20in%20US\n\nThe law directs $369bn toward investing in renewable energy and reducing America\u2019s planet-heating emissions, marking the country\u2019s most significant effort yet to combat the climate crisis. Experts have estimated the bill could reduce US emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, close to Biden\u2019s goal of cutting emissions in half by the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cThis bill is the biggest step forward on climate ever,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow us to boldly take additional steps toward meeting all of my climate goals, the ones we set out when we ran.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\n\nPresident Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act on Wednesday, codifying into law a major package of climate, health care and tax legislation.\n\nThe new law includes the U.S.\u2019 largest ever set of climate-focused investments, allocating nearly $370 billion to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions.\n\nhttps://www.esgtoday.com/biden-signs-largest-ever-us-climate-investment-package-into-law/\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House of Representatives has passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that includes a landmark $369 billion to fight the climate crisis through incentives for developing clean energy like solar and buying electric vehicles, or EVs.\n\nThe legislation passed the Senate earlier this month, and now it goes to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk \u2013 he has pledged to sign the measure into law in the coming days.\n\nThe bill is the single biggest investment in clean energy and decarbonization ever adopted by Congress. The funding will give a vital boost for tackling the climate emergency by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while also lowering energy bills for households.\n\n\u201cThe historic clean energy investments this legislation will make toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions will benefit every single American, including future generations,\u201d said EWG President Ken Cook. \u201cThe severe impacts of the climate crisis can be felt in every region, state and community throughout the country. Congress and the Biden administration have met the moment with a sweeping plan that will inject the resources required to kick start the clean energy economy.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/08/congress-sends-historic-369-billion-climate-clean-energy",

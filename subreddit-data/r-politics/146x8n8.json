I certainly wouldn\u2019t have thought that someone might take a position so superficially non-sensical as the one to which you\u2019re likely referring, but in the last few years I\u2019ve realized that many of his supporters would still back him literally no matter what he does or says. I could see that some people might not fully understand the implications of that hypothetical statement above, but since they still trust the source (mostly due to local herd/bubble groupthink, am radio, Fox \u201cNews\u201d Entertainment, etc\u2026.), that\u2019s good enough for them. Afterall, many of them in some states have an incredible job ahead of them\u2014that of harvesting all of those crops that aren\u2019t currently rotting in the fields because immigrants are justifiably afraid to work those jobs that US citizens also don\u2019t want, so who\u2019s left to harvest and process all those things? How will they find the time to be angry if they trust any other source but those that feed their shared group psychosis? We\u2019re \u201cjust asking the questions\u201d, people.\n\nIt\u2019s a personality cult, it\u2019s a cultural \u201calt-reality\u201d cult, and it\u2019s also a religious cult. \n\nThat\u2019s an unholy trinity right there; and yes, each of these three intertwined cults really are separate but equal cults to many of these people, with each cult dependent on the other two for survival. At stake are heart and mind of every poor soul that believes the lie that empathy doesn\u2019t matter. Not caring about others and how one\u2019s actions affect others is a dark path that inevitably leads only to suffering. \n\nTo defeat an unholy trinity like the one staring down our gate atm, one must address all three cults simultaneously. It\u2019s conceptually not dissimilar to the mythical Hydra. This is serious, and it will require coordinated deprogramming on all three fronts if we\u2019re ever to get past their imaginary defenses to a place where they realize that they\u2019re loved and deserving of love, and where they remember loving others\u2014or show them for the first time that tempering one\u2019s thinking with empathy toward others results in a net energy gain for them via the *It\u2019s a Wonderful Life* effect. \n\nI hope we\u2019re up for the challenge. This won\u2019t magically change when the boomers all die. We need to get parents to start loving their kids again by teaching them to choose love over fear and hate. We need to reach out and show them new and more positive and healthy ways to live their lives.",

I'm, like, totally not a terrorist or a white supremacist.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnd you know what? It's not just the FBI that's getting on my nerves. Everyone on Twitter is a terrorist white supremacist, too, not just me. I mean, how unfair is that? It's like they're just throwing that label around like it's no big deal. I thought Twitter was supposed to be a place where we can express ourselves freely, but it's turning into a total nightmare.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI'm, like, a spoiled brat, and I always get what I want, so this is just not acceptable.

Someone needs to recognize that I'm just a regular girl with opinions and feelings, not some extremist lunatic.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI can't even with these people anymore. They don't understand the struggles of being labeled a security threat, a terrorist, and a white supremacist for no reason. It's ruining my image, and that's, like, the most important thing in the world to me. I want everyone to know that I'm a special snowflake, not a criminal.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSo, yeah, I'm mad. I'm really, really mad. This whole situation is, like, the epitome of injustice. I won't stand for it.

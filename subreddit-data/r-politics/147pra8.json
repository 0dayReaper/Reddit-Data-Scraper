Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. that specialty license plates are government speech so are more easily regulated under the First Amendment. (Basically a specialty plate is the government itself endorsing something it\u2019s offering for sale so it has more leeway over what is or isn\u2019t on the plates.) So if North Carolina doesn\u2019t want to offer Confederate Flag license plates for sale it doesn\u2019t have to.",

Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise.\n\nI disagree with this, but I also very much doubt you\u2019d get a different answer with our current SCOTUS composition.",

Quite a fair amount feel that we should readopt the original motto E Pluribus Unum, Latin for Out of Many, One (also From Many, One). This was the official motto from the nation's founding up until 1956 when Eisenhower changed it to In God We Trust, which also mandated it to be printed on all currency.\n\nIt's a point regularly brought up on atheist forums, talk radio, youtube channels, and conventions. Most atheists in the U.S. want to see a much greater enforcement of the 1st Amendment's clause of 'make no laws respecting an establishment of a religion', including changing the state motto, removing religious symbols from government buildings (statuary, plaques, etc), and stopping state sponsorship of religious institutions.\n\nGranted, this certainly is not true of all atheists, and some are quite contented to be apathetic towards such issues. There are also those on the opposite end of the spectrum that are as anti theist as you can get who want religious worship banned in it's entirety. Both are a small subset of the whole however.",

That was put in because of King Henry VIII who established the Church of England, and decreed all subjects of the realm were Protestants, &amp; Henry put himself as head of the chruch. Thats still in practice today in England except the royal decree all subjects of the realm. That was struck from law. The reigning  King or Queen is still the head of the Church of England. \n\nSo Congress can not pass a law declaring &amp; establishing a national religion. The Constitution specifically prohibits it. \n\nWhat the Constitution also says is that authority not granted by the Constitution to the federal government resides with the States &amp; the people. A legally technicality is that the clause prevents Congress from establishing a national religion but no where does it prohibit states from doing it. if anthing, the Consitution expressly makes it a states right to determine a states religion.\n\nall states have their own Consitution governing the states laws. In the early days of the union, there were many \" religions\" &amp; they all tended to congregate in an area. Pennsylvania isnt called the Quaker State because of Quaker Oil. it was the Quakers who settled there. they didnt want the federal givernment to say Ye shall be Catholic or Baptist or Calvanist ( lots of Calvinists came to the US,) or Protestant. \n\nSo its a states right by Federal Constitutional amendement. Most states went along with saying states cant either, but a state with a predominantly say Muslim population, &amp; they are elected to state congress as a majority of the state congress &amp; senators , could possibly amend the state constitution allowing the establishment of a state religion, muslim, or baptist, or catholic. The Federal Constitution only prohibits the federal government from establishing a national religion. doesnt say anything about a state establishing one or that a state cant. \n\nThe state would lose federal money the federal government uses to bribe states into doing what they would like, but if a state doesnt care about federal money, the state could establish a state religion by amending the state constitution to allow it to. The only thing stopping it is diversity of population so there  isnt a majority of a religion in state congress representatives &amp; state senators that could &amp; federal money.\n\nedited.",

The general public has an active participation in decision making by vote for a law.  \n\nA Republic the people vote for representation in government.  but actually do not have active participation in the decision making process of laws. Their representatives make the decisions representing the will of the people of their district.  \n\nThe Constitution says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\"  \n\n\"Congress\" meaning federal Congress who can not  establish a national religion. Congress is also prohibited by that clause of the First Amendment of creating laws prohibiting the free exercise  of religion ( nationally). \n\nThe 10th amendement says \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" \n\nThats where states right come in . States have the powers to do what they want seperate from\nthe federal government, except where the Constitution says states cant. like interstate commerce or minting their own money. That authority &amp; right resides with the federal government. \n\nNo state has tried it but then diversity of population &amp; religion actually deters it from ever coming up. There can  be no consensus of elected representatives in state government who make the decisions because they all practice a different religion. \n\nBut it could happen if all the state government representatives decide to establish a state religion. The probability is very low, but its not impossible. \n\nthe flip is the people then vote out those who decided to &amp;  then elect a difderent set to decide differently to negate the laws previously made. \n\nThe States did that at the Constitutional level with a Constitutional Convention of states with the 18th &amp; 21st amendments. The 21st amendment negates the 18th. \n\n\nedited",

The House of Commons, the commoners who elect representatives to government &amp; the House og Lords. Hereditary nobility titles. The Monarchy pretty much was stripped of most of its power via the Magna Carta by the noble Lords. \n\nThe US has a house of representatives  similar in nature to house of commons. they represent the peoples interest in government. the senate , modeled after the house of lords without a nobility &amp; hereditary seat. The senate ( like Lords, e.g. Barons presiding over territory)  represents states interest in federal government. That is states have their own government &amp; own interests &amp; require representation in federal government to ensure states interests. The limited federal government was so the federal government like a monarchy could &amp; did,  couldnt upsurpt states interests. \n\nThe 13 colonies were more aligned as seperate areas on religious beliefs. As i previously mentioned, Pennsylvania isnt named The Quaker State for Quaker State Oil. The Quakers settled in that area. There were the  Calvanists, The Puritans, Lutherans,&amp; they all settled in different areas  but there were Englishmen as well. \n\nThey just didnt want government , a monarchy &amp; nobility dictating what they could &amp; couldnt do.",

Sons of Confederate Veterans*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-144) or to rule that custom license plate designs are limited public forums instead of government speech. Instead, it argues that *Walker* is inapplicable due to the particular nature of North Carolina\u2019s licensing regime.\n\nI don\u2019t think the distinction is persuasive, but even if it were, that\u2019s not the kind of case SCOTUS typically takes, because it\u2019s fact and statute-specific and is unlikely to have much of an impact beyond North Carolina. SCOTUS isn\u2019t going to micro-analyze every state\u2019s custom license plate regime to figure out which ones are government speech and which ones aren\u2019t.\n\nI think *Walker* was wrongly decided and would support a petitioner who brought a case arguing it should be overturned, but this isn\u2019t that case. If the petitioner isn\u2019t going to make the argument, there\u2019s nothing SCOTUS should do.",

For example, just because the state government sells license plates with state flags on them doesn't mean that the First Amendment then requires them to sell license plates with ANY flag on them (e.g. the state shouldn't be compelled to include, say, Nazi Flag license plates simply because it offers some plates with other flags on them.) The state is the one selling the plates and offering them to consumers, they're officially endorsed government speech. \n\nAnd in the Walker opinion they rightly point out that drivers who want to display a different message than what is offered on existing specialty plates have other equally good alternatives that don't require government endorsement such as bumper stickers. The First Amendment does protect (moron) drivers who want to put Nazi Flag bumper stickers on their car, for example, it just doesn't compel the state itself to sell official Nazi branded specialty plates.",

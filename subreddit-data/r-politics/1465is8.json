Like that.\n\nMAGA doesn't need to have a winnable strategy, they just need to create chaos and fear. Mussolini got himself elevated into power with the Fascist March on Rome in 1921, involving about 30,000 people in a city of about 700,000 and a country of about 37,000,000. It worked because the people in charge at the time feared bloodshed and disorder more than Fascism. I hope a strategy like that can't work here and now.",

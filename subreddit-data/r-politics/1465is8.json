Like that.\n\nMAGA doesn't need to have a winnable strategy, they just need to create chaos and fear. Mussolini got himself elevated into power with the Fascist March on Rome in 1921, involving about 30,000 people in a city of about 700,000 and a country of about 37,000,000. It worked because the people in charge at the time feared bloodshed and disorder more than Fascism. I hope a strategy like that can't work here and now.",

So he's been losing since 2018.\n\nAs a side note this is why most of these Republicans like Pence secretly want him gone even though they make a big show loyalty.\n\nIf the Democrats want to win in 2024 they have to show normie America what lunatics like Kari Lake are saying. For most Americans they believe \"both sides are the same\" and if you look at it through the lens of \"i'm living paycheck to paycheck and no one in washington is helping me\" then that's mostly true. When it comes to the money both sides pretty much take care of the rich first. That's why banks get bailouts. rich people get their PPP loans forgiven. But there are no bailouts for us if we get cancer and wipe out our life savings on treatment. We don't get our student loans forgiven.\n\nYou have to go to the American people and tell them Republicans literally want to kill them. Show them, they will reject the party.",

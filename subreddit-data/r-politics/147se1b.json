            "comment": "Rep Schiff is absolutely correct: this case had to be brought. If we can't prosecute the POTUS, than we don't have a functioning democracy. And, it is necessary for the entire world that the US government maintains some level of integrity. Trump has completely destroyed the US. And his continuing to flaunt illegal behavior was the proof that our democracy is a failure. By prosecuting him, the government is slowly earning back some of the trust and authority it lost over the last 5 years.",

Manafort later straight up admitted to it, too. But sure, \u201cno collusion\u201d just secret strategy meetings and giving Russian agencies all the info about which voters to target during their election manipulation\u2026",

It\u2019s about multiple phone calls trying to persuade and/or threaten officials to break the law, and about fake electors being solicited to do the same, both in Georgia and in other states.\n\nThe case is apparently going to be brought under Georgia\u2019s (not the Federal) RICO statute, which creates a separate conspiracy felony charge on top of two or more separate illegal acts if they both were committed to further a common objective.  Apparently, the prosecutor is planning on convicting Trump of felonies from both the phone calls and the fake electors, plus a third RICO charge of conspiracy. There are likely to be multiple people indicted besides Trump himself: I wouldn\u2019t want to be in Mark Meadows\u2019 shoes right now, or in Lindsey Graham\u2019s, or in Rudy\u2019s. Unless, of course, Mark Meadows flipped here, too.",

Forget the crime. It's contemptible, but that's not the issue. The outrage is that they not only chose to not act to save the lives of their citizens, it's that they THEN chose to profit from the coming deaths. \n\nThe big issue is the rejection of the opportunity to act as a servant of the public. You know, like a public servant should act. \n\nTheir decisions could have saved thousands of lives.",

However a procedural change was made to it the year after it passed, where the online disclosure of the trade was removed from the law. Now, if you want to see the trades Congress men and women are doing, you have to basically go to an office in DC that's open only certain days of the week, during certain specific hours, and request a document of the trade. \n\nAnd you have to do this for each trade made. So if a Senator shorted 6 stocks, that's a doc request six times. This request process applies to everyone: from the common citizen all the way up to th SEC, FTC, FBI, etc.\n\nDoes the act have teeth? Yes. But the overhead is now so significant, the act is pointless against Congress. However, against the common citizen? It's razor sharp as their provision of online disclosure is still valid.\n\nAs I understand it.",

They have so much money that they and anyone they care about never has to do a fucking thing again. And they *still go to work*. They've got so much money that nearly anything that happens involving money just doesn't matter to them. The most aggressive tax plan that could realistically get passed in the US still wouldn't drain their accounts enough that they or the next 5 generations of their family would ever have to work. And they *still keep fighting* these things. Like, once you've got so much money that you're basically a god, why do you even care about making more or stuff costing you money? A normal human in their position would just make sure the people around them are taken care of (or more realistically, pay someone else to do this), have a fun life, and chill. Not keep trying to make more, or fight against people getting a small chunk of your inconceivably huge pile of wealth. *Definitely* not commit crimes to try to make even more - I mean that's so fucking stupid - you have more money than god yet you'll take stupid risks to make more?

The death rate\\* for that plague was stunning, as well as mixed in with the circumstances of the Great War and lack of deep understanding of germs and viruses.  A century of advancement and knowledge makes it possible for us to contain a new virus and in theory limit the damage it can cause.  But Burr's fear mongering undoubtedly led to a stock market panic behind the scenes, creating a higher likelihood of a major depression.\n\n\\*I should mention that were COVID-19 to mutate into something more deadly, we could see a lot more deaths.  I'm truly hoping the general self-isolation we're doing now will reduce that possibility... or even better it mutates into something less deadly.",

The other three all have excuses for why this asset offloading is just a coincidence, I'll let you look them up and decide if they are credible yourselves.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the party matters that much, oligarchs going to oligarch. I'm more attached to progressives than I am to Democrats - Omar, AOC, and Tlaib would never do this.\n\nEdit: Worth noting that Inhofe and Feinstein were not at the Covid briefing, but the other two were.",

            "comment": "the NY Times article:\n\nOn Jan. 24, Richard Burr, a Republican senator from North Carolina, attended a private Senate briefing from senior government scientists about the seriousness of the coronavirus. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, received the same briefing.\n\nAt the time, many Americans did not yet understand the danger that the virus posed. The same day as the briefing, President Trump \u2014 in one of his many attempts over the past two months to make the virus seem like a frivolous matter \u2014 tweeted, \u201cIt will all work out well.\u201d\n\nGiven the disconnect between what they knew and the public\u2019s understanding, Burr and Loeffler had an opportunity to sound the alarm. They could have broken ranks with other congressional Republicans and told the country to take the situation more seriously. They could have criticized Trump for not doing more. Such criticism, coming from Trump\u2019s own party, would have received major attention. It would have had the potential to alter Trump administration policy and, by extension, the course the disease took.\n\nBut Burr and Loeffler did virtually nothing to protect the health and safety of their constituents or of Americans in other states. (Burr went so far as to co-write an article for FoxNews.com bragging about the country\u2019s readiness.) Here\u2019s what the two senators did instead: They sold large amounts of their personal stock holdings, cashing in before the market sharply declined, as the severity of the virus became apparent to everyone.\n\nThe Daily Beast broke the story of Loeffler\u2019s trades, which added up to between $1.2 million and $3.1 million. She started selling the shares the same day as the briefing. She also bought \u201cbetween $100,000 and $250,000 in Citrix, a technology company that offers teleworking software\u201d and whose share price has risen since the crisis began, The Daily Beast\u2019s Lachlan Markay, William Bredderman and Sam Brodey write.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics and ProPublica broke the news of Burr\u2019s trades, which amounted to between $600,000 and $1.8 million. Among the shares that he and his wife sold were those in three hotel companies, all of which have since seen their stock prices hammered, Karl Evers-Hillstrom wrote.\n\nLoeffler was appointed to her senate seat last year by Georgia\u2019s governor, and is running for election this November. Burr is currently in his third term and has said he would not run again.\n\nTheir sales are \u201can immense and outrageous abuse of the public trust,\u201d writes Lawfare\u2019s Susan Hennessey. \u201cIt\u2019s an inexcusably terrible thing to have done,\u201d she adds.",

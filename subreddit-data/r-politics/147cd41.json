If you see a comment that is, like, a partial sentence that doesn\u2019t make sense, or doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the comment it is replying to,  or that you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve already read somewhere in the thread- you copy the comment, paste it into the search bar, and then have a look. What I found when I did so with the comment we\u2019re talking about, I found the original comment which was made before this one and is more complete. Here\u2019s a link to the original comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/147cd41/desantis_reduced_miami_beach_covid_testing_out_of/jnv8bak/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3\n\nNotice how they both capitalize \u201cStellar\u201d? That\u2019s a very odd mistake to make, and the odds of two actually humans writing these comments exactly the same way is pretty low. \n\nThe next thing you can do it go to the bot\u2019s profile and do the same thing with other comments it has made. You will find that all their comments are stolen from other people. Report it.",

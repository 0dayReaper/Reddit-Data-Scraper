Would people be as interested in Obama after eight years of Gore? Nah. Hope and change from what? Another centrist Democrat? So Hillary gets the nomination in 2008 and loses to McCain, because even Democrats like McCain more than Hillary just in terms of likability and back then the only one really getting people bent was Sara Palin and the thought of McCain dying in office. So he wins and doesn't, yet, and she makes an ass of herself but is irrelevant. McCain does the exact same thing to save the economy that Obama did, takes credit for it, no Obamacare though--that's still the pet issue of a then still roughly united Democratic party that the people who now identify as progressive Democrats were not engaged with at all. They showed up at Occupy Something or Another but didn't vote.  \n  \nSo the signature issue of 2016 would have been healthcare, which Clinton had been championing since first ladyship, but there was no racist Tea Party backlash in the interim because there was no Obama and nothing for populists to backlash against.  \n  \nHillary runs against Ted Cruz. Democrats don't like Hillary and Republicans don't like Cruz. Ultra-low turnout, no sense of urgency or high stakes. Who wins? No one really cares that much. Trump is still a clown trying to gain publicity by running but he's long since dropped out.",

Single.  Person.  In this country needs to be ready to *lead*.  \n\nThe only way they can tank the economy is by instilling panic in retail investors.  It's what they do every single time.  They go liquid, they create a panic, they have their mouthpieces on radio and TV wailing about the end times, and they have the average person sell everything they own, and then they step in and buy it for fractions of a cent. \n\nThis is their game plan.  This is why they horde capital and borrow when borrowing is cheap.  It's legalized theft, and it's only legal because they paid charlatans with law degrees to write it into law. \n\nIt is the responsibility of every informed American to bolster the herd immunity against panic by holding strong, by leading your fellow man, by running for office in local elections, by showing empathy and by guiding people to truth.\n\nNot me.

Let's go with the idea that the establishment wants us to believe and assume for a second that Bernie is incapable of beating Trump. Okay, so Bernie loses and we have another 4 years of Trump, but one thing that Bernie does have is excitement, all those people that are extremely excited for Bernie will also be casting their votes for candidates down the line and what about independents and moderates, do we really think all those people are all of a sudden going to vote  Republican all across the board just because Bernie is on top? No, that's just ridiculous, they will just vote Trump or whoever else third party and then the they will stick with whatever candidate they were going to support down the line.\n\nNow let's look at the other candidates, which of them has the ability to get people to actually go out and vote? \n\nBiden? Are you serious, Biden couldn't get a horny teenage guy overdosed on blue pills excited. \n\nPete? Pete is a piece of white toast with nothing on it. \n\nBloomberg? Talk about the best candidate to make everyone stay home. \n\nWarren was probably the best alternative, but she has for the most part lost her wind by trying to straddle in the middle of the left and the center, she can't get enough people on the left to support her and she can't get enough people in the center to support her, she's stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't see how she makes it far enough.\n\nIf Yang was in the race I could see and argument being made for Yang.\n\nSo Bernie loses, Trump gets reelected, the house and senate probably get a bunch of Democrats in on the coat tails of Bernie even though he himself loses.\n\nIs that so bad? If the worst thing that happens is another four years of Trump but a Democrat House and Senate, I think that's pretty consolation prize. I rather have that than another four year of Trump AND a Republican House and Senate.\n\nPeople voting for you is what wins election, not just having the most \"palatable\" policies.",

A criticism was that he had a very large house that used a lot of electricity. This was supposed to expose some hypocrisy about him and the issue.\n\nThat's why I am not surprised to see this thing about Sanders having three houses.\n\nWhat these bad-faith critics are doing is to argue against the very idea of even caring about an issue. They're not really saying that Gore or Sanders are bad, they're gaslighting us into thinking that we should just accept the abuse of the wealthy and powerful. They will screw over our economy and planet and we're just supposed to shut up and take it. Were supposed to mock the idea of anyone in any power actually giving a shit about it.\n\nThis is what it means to address GLOBAL warming by talking about one guy's house, or extreme wealth consolidation in the BILLIONS by pretending to care about one guy's houses.\n\nEven worse is they are implicitly arguing against caring about anyone other than yourself. A friend recently asked me why I'm a socialist even though I'm not poor. He wasn't being confrontational or anything- it's just, I realized, he wasn't used to hearing about politics being discussed in a way that includes considering other people.",

The truth is also that, even if my past votes were for more centrist candidates, it was less that I was all for their policies, and often more that there wasn't a progressive candidate to choose from. I'm hoping those in the DNC who are freaking out wake up and see that supporting Bernie is the only right path.",

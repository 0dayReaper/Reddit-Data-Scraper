Jared Kushner and Ivanka Kushner walk out of the White House, and months later get $2 billion from the Saudis.\u201d\n- **Republican Chris Christie**\n\nIt is comical. Conservatives attack Biden claiming he took \"millions\" meanwhile The Trump family has literally taken Billions. \n\nBiden has been in elected office for 40yrs. Was a Senator and Vice President. If Biden was going to grift I think we all understand he could pull in more than a couple million dollars, lol. Biden could get more in speaking fees, a book deal, etc than conservatives are accusing him of taking as bribes. \n\nMeanwhile Trump has taken Billions of dollars.",

He could not have more blatantly been bribed and profiting off his presidency. \n\nFinally, didn't house Republicans, who have the ability to investigate, already investigate exactly this and find nothing. We should remind them of exactly this, Trump tried to use every tool he had to find dirt on Biden while in office also. If there was something there, Republicans have had every tool possible to find it, unlike Trump, Biden has done nothing to obstruct these investigations.",

I\u2019d have expected the above quote from any of my idiot coworkers but I always thought she was at least slightly more informed, it was very surprising to hear it come from her.

For example the whole if you steal $20 from a cash register you get 10 years but if you still $10 million you get a slap on the wrist.\n\nThey like this because it allows them to essentially create what they always wanted. A double standard ridden hierarchical social system, you know... a feudal system. Where the higher up the totem pole you are the more immune to things you become.",

For a start, refuse to move on to another question until you get an actual answer to the first. \n\nHere's a great example of Andrew Neil interviewing Ben Shapiro and really challenging him (Shapiro does not seem to realise either that Neil is himself a conservative, but takes the responsibility of impartiality seriously).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6VixqvOcK8E",

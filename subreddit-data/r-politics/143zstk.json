No American anywhere could deny what happened, everyone agreed it was a tragedy. People disagreed on how to respond, but not on the basic facts of the events. In hindsight, 9/11 basically worked. Islamic terrorist groups provoked exactly the response they wanted. America became dumber, more scared, wasted like a Trillion dollars on a war with no exit strategy and accomplished next to nothing.\n\nCovid, on the other hand, did the exact opposite. Misinformation meant it was a wedge used to divide an already polarized America. A bunch of Americans went to their deathbed thinking it was a hoax. It was less a provoked response, more chaos with dozens of amoral actors trying to use it to their own advantage.\n\nInvoking 9/11 means you'll get most people on the same page. Invoking Covid probably starts a fight. Hence 9/11's use as a cultural and political touchstone.",

If all three were to renege, Mr. Santos would need to return to court to put together a new bail package with different conditions, legal experts said.\n\nUnder any circumstances, it would be unusual for Mr. Santos to be detained before trial, said Nathan Reilly, a former prosecutor with the Eastern District of New York\u2019s public integrity section. Federal prosecutors, he said, rarely seek pretrial custody unless there is a threat of violence or a real chance that the defendant will flee prosecution.\n\nMr. Santos\u2019s pledge to go to jail \u201cis more political theater than legal strategy,\u201d he added.",

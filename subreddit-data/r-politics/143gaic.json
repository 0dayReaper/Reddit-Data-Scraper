Weigh in on the 4th of July, then six months later check and see who managed to drop the most lbs (EDIT: make that a higher % - that's more fair). It'd be win-win for Christie - there's no way that Trump would consent to have his weight broadcast to the entire world, so Christie could just relentlessly talk shit about how he might be fat, but at least he's not a coward like Trump. And if Trump *did* agree to participate, it would actually do Christie a world of good to try to lose some weight, plus Trump is way too undisciplined to compete legitimately and would probably overdose on amphetamines by the time judgment day came around.\n\nI am 100% serious about this.",

He makes no distinction between things he's heard vs. VERIFICATION for things he's heard. The claims ARE the evidence.\n\nFor a lot of these people, that's a workable epistemological model. That's why \"thousands of people saying there was voter fraud\" is the same thing in their mind as \"there was voter fraud.\" Or the same reason a lot of them take the Bible (a book full of claims) to be evidence for their particular view of history. It's decades of right-wing media running the \"people are saying\" stories coming home to roost. \n\nThis document claims there was a bribe, therefore: evidence.",

The document alleges that Joe Biden was paid by Burisma in a criminal bribery scheme to influence U.S. foreign policy in 2015 and 2016 when he was vice president.\n\n&gt;The FBI source described how a Burisma executive bribed the Bidens to get access to U.S. oil while Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin was investigating the company. The executive, according to the FBI source, wanted to pay Biden and his son $5 million each.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;\u201c$5 million for one Biden, $5 million for the other Biden,\u201d the executive said, according to the FBI source. The source believed these payments to both Bidens eventually occurred \u201cthrough so many different bank accounts.\u201d",

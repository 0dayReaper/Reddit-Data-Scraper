Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat on the board of the gas firm.\n\n&gt;The accusation was described by a \u201cconfidential human source\u201d in a June 2020 interview with the FBI, according to Fox, and comes from the contents of the FBI\u2019s FD-1023 form. The document alleges that Joe Biden was paid by Burisma in a criminal bribery scheme to influence U.S. foreign policy in 2015 and 2016 when he was vice president.\n\n&gt;The FBI source described how a Burisma executive bribed the Bidens to get access to U.S. oil while Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin was investigating the company. The executive, according to the FBI source, wanted to pay Biden and his son $5 million each.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;\u201c$5 million for one Biden, $5 million for the other Biden,\u201d the executive said, according to the FBI source. The source believed these payments to both Bidens eventually occurred \u201cthrough so many different bank accounts.\u201d",

Anyone not trapped in that will find the information about how the majority of the EU and the entire state department wanted this guy out.

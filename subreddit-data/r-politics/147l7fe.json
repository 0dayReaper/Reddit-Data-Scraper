We had friends that were all sorts of races and creeds. Gay and Straight.\n\nThey actually BELIEVE the bs fox feeds them about everything. We are all between 38-43. And it breaks my heart because they are my siblings and when it does come up (not by me btw... I love them enough to just want to chat and not talk politics), they shut down the conversation as soon as anything remotely challenges what they think. \n\nThe two older siblings... I kinda get. But its my younger sister that bugs me the most. She loves DeSantis, loves Trump. Apparently, he tells it like it is. Which is worse because if thats how she feels, then it means her entire worldview is fucked up and, in her heart, there is a ton of hate if telling it how it is means disenfranchising large groups of people. Which is hard for me to understand with the multicultural friends we had growing up.\n\nAll I can do is shrug about it and hope something eventually triggers in their minds and they can see reality and these people they 'love' to have running shit for who they are.",

Even for loved ones, you can only truly control yourself in the long run and sometimes all you can do is let go and watch what path they choose after you give input.\n\nI think as a species we have far to much faith we're in control of ourselves, mislead into believing self awareness is self control. Most of us wouldn't kill someone in cold blood, put their kid in Mortal danger and get that fight or flight mode and ask again and many people might find they can kill after all. I think most of us get that and can at least empathize with that.\n\nEnter right wing am radio and tv. They've spent time since Nixon fine tuning, employing, and overclocking their listeners' fight or flight. They use that same tactic to get people looking at everything like it's life and death important. Easier to do everything once that hook is set, make them more afraid, pliable, angry, even violent. Most importantly, stop believing anyone else!\n\nIt's an ancient and repetitive trend that tv and Internet have turned nuclear recently.",

To everyone, to some degree, the world is under an obligation to conform to their worldview. The most susceptible to this are the ones that do wind up falling for literal cults, and the worship of Trump absolutely qualifies.\n\nBut, say, when you learned that Bill Cosby was a rapist, if you had even a moment of going \"no, that's not possible\" (and I certainly know that I did), then you're not completely immune to it, either. The reality is that nobody is immune, and in fact, the people who claim to be immune to it are in fact the most vulnerable to it.\n\nRearranging a pre-set worldview to accommodate for inconvenient facts is *hard*.",

Thats how they sent and received info.  Haspel claims the Iranians figured this out somehow and passed it on to China and allegedly these sites were all somehow tied together and therefore easy to find more.\n\nFinally she claimed as well some assets in China did themselves no favors doing things like buying jaguars (the car)\n\nIt ALSO should be remembered that no one is ever truly \u201cretired\u201d from the CIA in the sense that Haspel very well could be lying entirely to cover up how the spies were actually caught etc (not maliciously - literally because this level of detail caught me off guard)",

Because of the lack of a physical American presence in Iran, the CIA needed to have a way for assets to communicate back in a secure but discreet manner. A bunch of fake websites were set up for this, disguised as online businesses that allowed communication channels with certain logins and customer interactions.\n\nOne of the CIA assets was an Iranian double agent, and using this, Iran was able to track down and arrest or turn enough other assets to discover the whole fake website network. They had enough in common that once certain patterns were discovered, others could be found using open data like Google, allowing them to target the and expose the whole CIA network in Iran.\n\nThen, Iranian intelligence shared this info with China, and the Chinese intelligence had a great time with this, discovering a similar network in their own country and nearly rooting out the entire network.\n\nThere was a Darknet Archives episode about this, which interviewed the journalists which broke this story and found a whistleblower who discovered this original vulnerability and was originally ignored and is now punished for his whistleblowing.",

            "comment": "Didn't see any other comments describing the actual content of this article, so copying the important parts here.\n\n**TL;DR:** During Trump's term but before he brought the documents to Mar-a-Lago, Chinese nationals illegally gained access to Mar-a-Lago on at least two occasions. One of them was carrying four phones. In other words, **foreign spies were already known to target and penetrate the location before Trump chose to store the documents there.**\n\n&gt;Tapper also noted that Mar-a-Lago has had issues with intruders on the property down the years, including two Chinese nationals who were accused of trespassing in 2019 prior to the classified materials being kept at Trump's Palm Beach residence.\n\n&gt;When noting how two Chinese nationals and a third woman had illegally gained access to Mar-a-Lago in recent years, Tapper added: \"That's not secure, right?\"\n\n&gt;\"That's absolutely right, that is not secure,\" Parlatore said in reference to the boxes on the stage.\n\n&gt;In February 2020, Chinese national Jing Ly was found guilty of resisting a police officer without violence after ignoring warnings to leave Mar-a-Lago and then returning to take pictures of the resort in December 2019. She was found not guilty of trespassing by a jury, and argued that the language barrier meant she didn't understand when a security officer told her to leave the resort.\n\n&gt;In March 2019, another Chinese woman, Yujing Zhang, also gained access to Mar-a-Lago despite not being a member of the resort.\n\n&gt;After telling Secret Service agents she was there to swim at the resort, she was allowed to enter as security thought she was the daughter of an existing member because she had the same surname.\n\n&gt;Zhang raised suspicions as she didn't have a swimming costume. She later changed her story and said she was there to attend a U.N. friendship event between the United States and China, despite evidence on her phone suggesting she knew the event had been canceled.\n\n&gt;Zhang was carrying a total of four cellphones, a laptop and other electronic gear, promoting fears she could have been a spy. She was never charged with espionage, but later found guilty of trespassing and lying to Secret Service agents and deported.",

            "comment": "&gt;The poll asked U.S. adults whether they support several practices   \nauthorized by Section 702. It found that 28 percent of adults support   \nthe government listening to phone calls made outside of the U.S. without  \n a warrant, while 44 percent oppose the practice. Views are similar   \nabout the U.S. reading emails sent between people outside of the U.S.   \nwithout a warrant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the latest poll, 48 percent of Americans this year said they believed  \n it necessary to sacrifice their rights and freedoms to prevent   \nterrorism, down from 54 percent in 2021 and nearly two-thirds in 2011.   \nThat shift was especially dramatic among Republicans, with just 44   \npercent saying that\u2019s sometimes necessary compared with 69 percent in   \n2011. Among Democrats, 55 percent still say so, similar to the 59   \npercent who said so in 2011.\n\nAmericans stopped trusting government during the Vietnam War. Now they actively *dis*trust it, and the intelligence services attached to it.\n\nOf course the latest document debacles don't do much to assuage those concerns.",

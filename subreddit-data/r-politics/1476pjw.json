Of course not...... \n\nOh you're waiting on Fox to summarize it for you.......... Yeah okay buddy keep on thinking this is good news.",

Let's say he has to stay at Mar-a-Lago (I agree that he should not be allowed a phone or internet or even get access to TV). Does that mean MAL has to close down as a country club for the risk of other people, including foreign nationals, coming within a stone's throw of Trump? If MAL has to close it's doors to members, not only does this slash Trump's income, but he's also not technically supposed to even LIVE there, since it's classified as a commercial building instead of a residence. Granted, the Florida GOP was never going to circle back to that tax-avoidance, but a future Dem governor or AG could. Even skating on it as a residential property, he wouldn't even be getting any income from it at all.\n\nThis leaves Trump paying for an expensive property that hosts only him, his Secret Service guards, and the minimum staff to keep his living area functioning? I don't see why the government would pay for almost anything regarding his house arrest when they could have just put him in prison instead if they were going to foot the bill for his incarceration.",

I still work as a lawyer for the government. \n\nIt is very rare that a plea deal is not on the table although in more serious cases the terms of a plea may be very narrow. \n\nSo for example, in a murder case, the plea deal might be, you plead guilty to murder and you get life in prison. If you don't plead we're asking for the death penalty and it's up to the jury whether you get the death penalty or life in prison. \n\nOr a similar example, in a rape case, you might plead and instead of life in prison or 25 years you might get a sentence where you could become parole eligible in 20. \n\n\nIf you were negotiating a plea on behalf of trump, obviously Trump is the biggest problem. But beyond that, you would want to know what Jack Smith actually wants to get out of this case.  Does he want to prevent Trump from doing harm in the future? Or does he want to make an example of it Trump to show that an ex-president can be sentenced to jail.\n\nBecause if I was approaching this like Trump's criminal defense lawyer, my mind would be going to a \"no prison plea deal.\" \n\nIf convicted on all counts, Trump could very realistically get quite a prison sentence. But more likely is something like 3 to 10 years. \n\nIf I was Trump's criminal defense lawyer, I would be going to Jack Smith and saying look, he's a man in his 70s, what do you actually want here?   I would propose that Trump pleads guilty, and gets a set of probation conditions that basically includes an agreement that he will not seek public office, will not discuss his presidency on public media, and can never hold office or receive classified info again.   \n\nI would argue to the prosecutor that this would remedy the vast majority of the harm that Trump inflicted and prevent anything from occurring again.  And that because he's an old man who would have to be in 100% protective custody that putting him in prison serves little purpose. \n\nStepping out of defense attorney shoes, I don't think for a second that Trump would ever follow the terms of that deal. But I would be telling him as his lawyer that this is the deal, and if he wants to avoid going to actual prison he needs to go back to Mar a Lago and disappear.",

It would make a lot of sense for his defense team to offer a plea deal to the prosecution. \n\nI was thinking more about the prosecution's perspective.

First, it seems almost silly.  Yes, there is a chance he'll win the general in 2024.  But I'd not consider a strong chance given the loss in 2020, the demographic changes from the pandemic, the delta from not being the incumbent and all the garbage/drama since.  So, why even worry?  Next, it seems almost unsound and risky since it could be undone via a pardon.\n\nBeyond that however, I am much more concerned about the larger and broader impact on society and the future should Trump get off easy.  Given the extraordinary public awareness, this would seem to be using a bullhorn to scream it's OK to screw around with classified documents and even lie about it to the feds... and to underscore how nobody needs to worry about the PRA.\n\nTrump crossed several red lines here.  He must be punished harshly to remind all future presidents of their responsibilities and duties and to train the voters to choose more wisely in this regard.",

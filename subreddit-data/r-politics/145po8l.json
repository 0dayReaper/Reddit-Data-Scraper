I realize he has his first-amendment right too, but he should make no mistake that that word is a bad word and he said it six times in a video. It's disgusting.\"\n\nSo he thinks the black dude should apologize for rapping along to a song but he let the cranky white bigot keep talking while throwing out the black guy. For being upset. Like Jones is being right now in this statement.",

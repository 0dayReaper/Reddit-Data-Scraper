It's not rational. It's not deliberated. It's all emotional. He has a *cult*.\n\nSecondly, West Germany (which became unified Germany in the 1990s) has normalized the \"persecution\" of Nazis, the German Communist Party, ISIS, etc. (any totalitarian, anti-democratic movement) since the *1950s*. And now we see why, because a people can be brainwashed to end Democracy itself. In 2023, Germany today is recognized as a place with high freedom of speech, quality of life, and tolerance of rights of minorities. That's not an equally bad outcome compared to Nazi Germany, which ended in ruin.\n\nBTW Weimar Germany isn't a great comparison, because it was *Hitler himself* who led the campaign to eradicate Communists after he took plenary power through the Enabling Act. And Hitler targeted all leftists too, not just Communists. Meanwhile, post-war West Germany only banned specifically the German Communist Party; other far leftist parties are still allowed.",

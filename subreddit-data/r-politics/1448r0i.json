Maybe we should reconsider what is important and why we are lagging behind other countries. At least one of these reasons is student debt, other countries, even if they have student loans/debt ameliorate the impact by subsidizing the colleges and reducing the debt load on students. Because it puts more money in the economy from consumers, allows students to get the education they need to get ahead, and on the whole improves the standing of workers for employers(smarter, less stressed workers are better workers). It's a terrible example of US exceptionalism that we continue to force people to work for poverty wages, refuse to allow avenues for your average person to get a head start without incurring massive debt, and continue the system despite seeing these hurdles for the working class.",

His parents either forged his digital signature each year or he didn\u2019t have a clue what he was agreeing to. \n\nBoth of these students have now paid off their loans, thankfully, but mainly because they have unusually high-paying jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated.

There is no shortage of blue-collar workers (often plumbers, electricians, contractors, etc.) who rail against higher education with the core of their argument being the fact that they make over $100k per year. There is a lot of truth in their argument, but also a lot of caveats. I think if you are going to work for someone else (and not become a small business owner), it's easier to break that $100k threshold if you have a college degree. There is also the additional caveat regarding the desirability of the work; most people find working a white collar desk job to be less physically taxing than a typical blue collar job. But the point is still totally valid that you can make decent money in many blue collar fields if you apply yourself, find a good company who will help pay for training, and then there is an added bonus if you enjoy the work itself.",

I think the average income for non-educated is 32k. I wonder how they are holding up?\n\nEdit: Honestly I'm not really sure what I'm getting it.

CONGRESS already authorizes the Sec Ed to do this any time they want. It says so right it the text. This is not complex legalese. This law was made PERMANENT in 2007. So past congress members have already voted on this repeatedly and found it valid enough to make it permanent. If they disagree, then they can try to repeal it I guess, but idk how they'd try to justify it.",

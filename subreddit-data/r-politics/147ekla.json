Mostly because the nature of the case.  If that's the case it narrows the options and could tilt it in the governments favor.\n\nAs to the judge?  There's definitely a case to be made that she's biased against the prosecution and has already had 2 rulings overruled on appeal.  Which could force them to remove her from being allowed to hear the case.  I strongly suspect Smith is savvy enough to fight to change judge.  It's also easy to prove that she shows Trump favor.",

To get into where things went wrong we have to do a deep dive into the forgotten age of American politics. \n\nThings *started* to go wrong in the middle 1870's when (southern) Democrats managed to suppress black turnout enough to steal the south back-Republicans then accepted a devils compromise for the presidency, withdrawing the last troops in exchange for Hayes winning the nomination. \n\nThis was really caused by Grant fucking up and letting corruption run his presidency, but that's a messy topic.\n\nIn any case this broke the Republicans social progressive platform in it's moral core, as now the North/South line was basically reestablished-Black voters were put back into slavery, both de facto and quite literal slavery, until WW2. \n\nStill, the party up to and including Theodore Roosevelt proved to be socially and fiscally progressive, and made great strides in breaking the corruption and inequity of American society. Roosevelt wasn't perfect, but was legitimately better than the time he lived and really did try. Then he broke with Taft, split the vote, and Wilson won.\n\nAnd, to be entirely and fully clear, America has been pretty thoroughly *fucked* since.\n\nAt this point the Democrats were still the racist ones, and Wilson was the worst. Wilson is so bad that, even understanding what some other presidents have done, Wilson is still either the worst or second worst president of all time. Wilson is basically Hitler with a veneer of academia. He's that bad. He's the reason segregation reached DC. He's the reason the KKK came back. He's the reason anti-communist raids became normal. He's the reason blatant American colonialism became public policy. If something bad happened, Wilson started it. The greatest failure of the American social studies education program is that Wilson somehow scores in the top 10-20 of Presidents even now-Wilson was an *absolute shit*. *Everything* bad is due to Wilson. \n\nThe presidents in between Wilson and Eisenhower were *all* at best social moderates. FDR got the closest to reform, but no one was a saint. Eisenhower is the last reasonable Republicans president, and the parties at this time were hardly clearly divided-Democrats tended to be economically progressive but socially conservative and Republicans tended to be economically conservative and socially progressive, but both combinations of those traits prevent real progress from happening and differences were slight.\n\nAnd then we get JFK and LBJ. This is where the swap happened. JFK starts socially progressive policies and LBJ delivers, truly delivers. And the Republican party loses its shit.\n\nHence the timeline is basically-Republicans good \\~Lincoln, mediocre \\~Hayes, good \\~Teddy, *not the fucking antichrist* \\~Wilson, and everyone is mediocre until JFK and LBJ turn the democrats liberal and republicans conservative. \n\nThat was supposed to be quicker, but I got distracted explaining why *Wilson the racist antichrist fuckstick* ruined everything.",

I think Smith is feeling her out, he has 5 days to decide.\n\nAs for the she dismisses it without the jury, that's the scenario that they are claiming.  I don't think Smith is willing to let her just kick it out of court.\n\nEdited to add: Things that can be used to remove her https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-001.html#NRS001Sec235",

            "comment": "From the article:\n \n\n&gt;&gt;To begin with, Smith was exceedingly unlucky in his drawing of a judge. The case was assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, the same judge whose interference in the original search of Mar-a-Lago was roundly criticized and rejected by the Eleventh Circuit (the appellate court that oversees her district). Her past rulings suggest that her instincts will favor Trump. Federal district judges have substantial discretion in the conduct of trials, and so their underlying proclivities can matter.\n\n&gt;&gt;To take one extreme example, consider the impact of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a). This rule\u2014obscure to most Americans, though well known in the criminal-defense bar\u2014gives a federal judge the power to dismiss a prosecutor\u2019s case at the end of the prosecutor\u2019s presentation on a finding that the government has not presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This broad discretion is rarely used, because it allows a judge to substitute their own judgment for that of the jury. But it does exist and, more important for our purposes, it is completely unreviewable. For reasons of double jeopardy, if a judge dismisses a case at the close of the prosecutor\u2019s presentation, that\u2019s the end of it. One does not have to be completely Machiavellian to see in this power the prospect of judicial interference and disruption.\n\n&gt;&gt;Within certain boundaries, trial judges have almost unreviewable discretion to determine what evidence will, and will not, be presented to a jury. Often, judges use that authority to trim frivolous defense arguments. Sovereign-tax protesters, for example, are not allowed to offer evidence that they think shows that the U.S. government is not constitutionally authorized to impose an income tax. Nonsense arguments like that are simply ruled out of bounds.\nMany of Trump\u2019s defenses to the espionage charges border on frivolous. The \u201cI can declassify a document just by thinking about it\u201d and the \u201cI\u2019m entitled to keep whatever documents I want from my presidency\u201d defenses genuinely have no legal basis. Many judges would, quite properly, exclude testimony about those issues as an attempt to confuse the jury with irrelevant matters. But that decision is not inevitable, and a small minority of judges might reach the opposite conclusion, inevitably complicating Smith\u2019s presentation of the case and reducing the likelihood of a conviction.\n\n&gt;&gt;Far more prosaically, trial judges have near absolute and plenary authority over the timing of trials in their courtroom. They set the deadlines for when discovery must be completed, for when motions must be filed, for how quickly (or slowly) they decide those motions, and, ultimately, for when the trial will be scheduled.",

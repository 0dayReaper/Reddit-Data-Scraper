                    "comment": "One of my favorite examples of his spinelessness: \n\n&gt; In January 2013, after an unsuccessful attempt by Tea Party conservatives to overthrow House Speaker John Boehner, a rookie congressman from North Carolina slinked into the speaker\u2019s office complex inside the U.S. Capitol. Mark Meadows had not voted against Boehner on the House floor. But he had participated in the plotting\u2014and word had since leaked out naming him as one of the conspirators. Frightened that he would be exiled to the hinterlands of the House, the freshman sought an audience with the speaker.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s on the couch, sitting across from me in my chair, and suddenly he slides off the couch, down onto his knees, and puts his hands together in front of his chest,\u201d Boehner recalled to me. \u201cHe says, \u2018Mr. Speaker, will you please forgive me?\u2019\u201d (This incident was witnessed by several people, including Boehner\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Sommers, who described it as \u201cthe strangest behavior I had ever seen in Congress.\u201d)\n\nSource: https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/04/mark-meadows-trump-covid-425912",

Really the only other people who would be relevant in the same way to all of those at the same time would be members of Trump's family who are much less likely to be honest than an immunized Mark Meadows. Nobody really knows at this point, but I'm thinking some kind of partial immunization is most likely where Mark Meadows would still face charges but his charges would be much reduced, especially if he cooperates on all of the cases significantly.",

Garland is someone we know to be afraid of the right and has in the past limited investigations in order to keep them placated. He's a stooge",

Trump has weaseled out of everything; I can't count how many times it seemed like he was fucked, only for it to come to nothing. People thought that Mueller report was going to take him down, and that was a complete dud. His indictment in NY is over a case that almost nobody in the country will care about and won't decrease his electoral prospects even if he *is* found guilty. His penalty for sexual assault was a fine that he can easily pay, combined with an *increase* in his polling averages. To people who are in the legal field, perhaps this situation seems different from all of those; but for those of us outside the legal field, it's easy to become skeptical",

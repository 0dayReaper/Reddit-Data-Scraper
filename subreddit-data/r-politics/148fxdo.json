The higher courts could actively remove cases from her docket (which they don't do as a habit).   She might have a hard time getting a promotion to a higher position because she has a black mark on her record.  \n\nThere have been arguments that federal judges actually have more ways to be removed but none of the people powerful in the current legal system believe them (as far as I can tell).  \n\nAnd once the jury is actually hearing the case, there are tons of ways to dismiss the case so it can never be heard again.   \n\nJust as one example:  There was a case where some police officers were using the court cameras to focus in on the the defense's paperwork, then giving that information to the prosecution.   When the judge found out, they were *pissed* and dismissed the whole case outright.   And the defendant can never be charged again.     \n\nThe judge did not wait for a different trial to prove that an actual crime had been committed.  Or for appeals of that trial.  They saw the evidence and dismissed the thing.    \n\nEdit:  Oh.  And you don't have to be a member of the Bar or even a lawyer to be a federal judge.  So getting disbarred wouldn't remove her from the position.    \n\n  I think you could probably investigate her for corruption but I am *very* skeptical of the idea that the FBI/DOJ should be opening investigations into the judges they have cases in front of.     \n\nLike, would they tap her phone?  The phone of a judge they are presenting in front of?   That's a terrible, dangerous idea.  Because it will instantly be used against poor black people en masse.   \n\nEdit 2:  I want to amend my thinking of investigating judges.  The DOJ should totally do that but it has to be a completely siloed department.   Which they have.   So maybe that group could be looking into it while the Trump people are doing their own things.",

Once again, by standard procedure, she was assigned this case because she has previously handled it.\n\nSmith and his team did not request her in any sense other than that by laying the charges in Miami they get her by default due to court policy.  \n\nHer assignment is not at all a 'bad thing'.  Either she will recuse herself, or the appellate court above her will recuse her and assign the case to another judge, or she will commit an error egregious enough for the prosecution to force her removal.\n\nOr, perhaps, she will actually conduct the trial fairly and without favoritism.  If she expects any kind of future on the federal bench beyond the next Democratic Congress' ability to impeach her then either this or self recusal is her best bet.",

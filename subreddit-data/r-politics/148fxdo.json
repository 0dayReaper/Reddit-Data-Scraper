Once again, by standard procedure, she was assigned this case because she has previously handled it.\n\nSmith and his team did not request her in any sense other than that by laying the charges in Miami they get her by default due to court policy.  \n\nHer assignment is not at all a 'bad thing'.  Either she will recuse herself, or the appellate court above her will recuse her and assign the case to another judge, or she will commit an error egregious enough for the prosecution to force her removal.\n\nOr, perhaps, she will actually conduct the trial fairly and without favoritism.  If she expects any kind of future on the federal bench beyond the next Democratic Congress' ability to impeach her then either this or self recusal is her best bet.",

We have a document classification system that marks documents themselves 'classified' - we need this primarily for red tape &amp; liability purposes, and what can and can't be shared through FOIA requests\n\n2. The president can say anything that's classified without repercussion, anything he publicly says becomes declassified automatically because... otherwise he could be charged for leaking secrets, and the president shouldn't be held down by that. This does not however automatically declassify documents containing that information, as they typically have things like agents and investigative methods that would still need to stay classified. Saying \"We know country Y is planning to bomb Country Z\" doesn't declassify the document from the field agent who reported it, or it would out our spies. \n\n3. The president also has the authority to contact the document archives and force a document to be declassified without restriction. This is a different thing completely, but he is required to contact the archives or there's no record of it - meaning it's never flagged as declassified and would not be available through a FOIA request.\n\nSo they're confusing the document classification system with information classification.",

I'm also not sure there's actually a statute that'd prevent him from making as many copies as he'd like while he's a sitting president. [Review the executive order that the entire system rests upon.] (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information)\n\nI don't say this to defend Trump, but people need to understand that *a lot* of the policy around how classified defense information is handled basically boils down to \"however the POTUS wants it handled\". A sitting president could arguably abolish the entire concept of defense classified information on a whim. People seem to assume there's some great framework of law that establishes all these rules and provides checks and balances on how the executive determines and protects defense data - but there isn't. The president issued a relatively short order on how he wants things to work and then agencies write a lot of policy to try and suit that - but those policies don't bind the executive.\n\n Trump is a bad person and was a bad president, but a lot of this misbehavior has been enabled by our elected representatives basically saying \"we don't want to pass laws, the president is the king\" for a hundred years. That's a real problem.\n\nThere's very little chance there would be a case here if he did all this stuff only while he was a sitting president. Keeping documents beyond the period of time where he had that power is what makes this easy (relatively) to prosecute.",

There's no reason there *can't* be a law except that the US public hasn't put pressure on congress to pass one - probably because they assume that there's laws that don't exist.",

He likes breaking rules and laws, it gives him a power kick, that's why he has dozens of up coming indictments. \n\nJust the possession of them is also a kick for him, as well as taking them. They are objects of power; their contents can ruin the defence of a nation and hang a hundred spies.\n\nThe Trump org was involved in over a thousand different pieces of litigation. So that's another piece of the puzzle - he is very blithe about breaking the law. There barely has to be a reason for him to do it, it's almost just the way he lives.\n\nSo now he has them. And now I have to say he almost certainly sold them or gave them away to people who had done him favours. There is an outside chance they were stolen - a Chinese spy was caught in is Mar-a-lago compound. I say this simply because they are missing, there are lots of empty folders. I think Trump, fool though he is, would know 'Macron has a mistress' might be valueable info, as would a list of spies and similar rare pieces of info. But he probably grabbed anything he liked.\n\nEventually the DOJ asked for them back, but, because he couldn't give them back and probably couldn't think of a good excuse for their disappearance, he gave them the run around and here we are today. Obstruction alone can be up to 25 years in jail! I think he will rack up, with all of the other cases, decades of jail time.",

Huge difference between the two probes. \n\nBiden can make the argument that the classified documents found on his property were there by mistake. And it\u2019s a strong argument. There\u2019s no evidence that he was aware they were there. There\u2019s no evidence anyone was accessing them. There\u2019s no evidence that they were hidden or held back. And Biden voluntarily submitted to the comprehensive and holistic sweep of all his properties to search every single box and find any possible document. And he voluntarily gave them all back without any resistance. And all the documents in question were low level classified, none had any connection to national defense, and it\u2019s very believable that they could have been stored incorrectly by mistake. \n\nYou\u2019d never find a jury that would vote unanimously that they\u2019re confident beyond a reasonable doubt that Biden intentionally broke the law.\n\nTrump however they have evidence he specifically requested these documents. They have evidence he knew they were classified. They have evidence he knew where they were. They have evidence he was continuing to access them and giving access to other people too. He was given multiple opportunities to give the documents back voluntarily and only gave pieces back, continuing to hold onto top secret national defense documents. It took the extraordinary measure of a search warrant on his property to retrieve those documents and even after then more documents were found that he was hiding elsewhere. He made his lawyers sign a document swearing all classified documents had been turned over when he knew for a fact that he still had a bunch. And the documents in question were top secret, compartmentalized, national defense documents that were so incredibly sensitive there\u2019s no possible believable argument that they could have gotten there by accident. They even have him on tape admitting openly that he is in possession of at leash one document that he knows is a top secret national defense document that he knows is still classified. \n\nThe cases couldn\u2019t be any more different. The very fact that the Biden case exists is to strengthen the case against Trump. In order to stave off the argument that they are targeting Trump for political purposes, they wanted to be sure they did the exact same extensive searches for all other Presidents and former Presidents. And guess what? They didn\u2019t need to get a search warrant for anyone else, they were invited to come in and search anything they wanted to.",

It couldn\u2019t, since classification wasn\u2019t a thing yet. \n\nIn order for it to be a violation of the Espionage Act, the document needs to have pertained to the national defense. That\u2019s it. It could be 100% declassified but the fact that he had it unlawfully, allowed others access to it unlawfully, and then refused to return it (again unlawfully) is what makes this a slam dunk violation of the Espionage Act. \n\nClassified or not would likely have relevance to the sentencing. But it has absolutely no relevance to the question of guilt or innocence. Given that the documents were certainly NOT declassified and they have Trump on tape admitting that, then that leaves us at him committing espionage, and the documents in questions were of the highest possibility sensitive in existence and pertained to the national defense. And it\u2019s a separate charge for each document generally. \n\nIf they have evidence he offered access to the documents in any way to people unauthorized to have access to it, and ESPECIALLY if there is any evidence that he asked for or expected compensation (ANY kind of compensation) from those persons from doing so, then he\u2019s getting buried under the prison. At that point the death penalty is technically on the table.",

Not actually doing anything with them?\n\nThis is assuming in the scenario that he simply took it alongside the other boxes of stuff, and just left it in that room. Obviously that's not what happened, but is that enough to charge?\n\nVery interesting, thank you",

What you do with it however will determine how much of a priority the DOJ puts on prosecuting you, and how harshly you\u2019ll be sentenced. If you did nothing with it, it was clearly accidental, the documents were relatively low level classified, and no damage resulted, the DOJ probably doesn\u2019t want to bring charges. They like slam dunks and that\u2019s not a slam dunk. Maybe they try anyway, but they\u2019re smart enough to know it\u2019ll be an uphill battle even if the letter of the law is on their side. \n\nThe key aspects here are:\n\n- Knowledge that he was in possession of it (he brags about having it on tape, and some of the documents were in his office desk, not just in storage)\n\n- Knowledge that he was not permitted to possess this document (testimony and evidence that he clearly knew what the proper declassification process was, and did not follow it here)\n\n- Knowledge of the sensitivity of the document (he\u2019s on tape bragging about how sensitive the document is, how it\u2019s top secret, still classified, and that it pertains to national defense, and when he did return some documents voluntarily they treated them as if they were top-secret classified)\n\n- AFTER the Archives requested the documents back and they gave some back, knowledge that he still possessed these top-secret, national-defense documents (the document he bragged about isn\u2019t one of the ones that was initially returned, so he clearly still knew he had it)\n\n- AFTER the Archives requested the REST of the documents back and had his legal representation sign an affidavit swearing under oath that no further documents remained, knowledge that some of those top-secret, national defense documents still remained (again, the document he bragged about had not been returned yet, and some top secret documents would be found in his office drawers later)\n\nAll those aspects factor into how strong the case is. They have ample evidence of every single aspect of this, enough that anyone short of a MAGA-fanatic could be convinced to convict. And those insane MAGA-fanatics are super easy to filter out of a jury pool in a voir dire. They\u2019re terrible at hiding their bias.",

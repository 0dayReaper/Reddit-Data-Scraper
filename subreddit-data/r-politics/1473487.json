            "comment": "[Fact check explores presidential authority to declassify](https://abalegalfactcheck.com/articles/declassified.html)\n\n&gt; As an Aug. 4 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report described, procedures established in both the executive and legislative branches outline a process for declassifying intelligence, which includes deliberate methods for evaluating the need to serve the public interest while protecting intelligence. The classification system for national security information is principally a function of the president\u2019s authority under the U.S. Constitution as commander in chief, which gives the president broad powers to classify and declassify such information.\n\n&gt; Historically, both Republican and Democratic presidents have issued executive orders (EO), which spell out detailed sets of procedures, to implement this authority. In 2009, President Barack Obama issued EO 13526, the most recent EO which provided such guidance to federal agencies. But as a previous ABA Legal Fact Check noted, presidents can modify or nullify EOs although there is no evidence that then-President Trump did so with the Obama executive order.\u00a0\n\n&gt; Some secrets, such as information related to nuclear weapons, are handled separately under a specific statutory scheme that Congress has adopted under the Atomic Energy Act. Those secrets cannot be automatically declassified by the president alone and require, by law, extensive consultation with executive branch agencies.\n\n&gt; In all cases, however, a formal procedure for recording and memorializing classification decisions is required so governmental agencies know with certainty what has been declassified. A federal appeals court in a 2020 Freedom of Information Act case, New York Times v. CIA, underscored that point in denying the paper access to documents after tweets by then-President Trump regarding a covert program in Syria. \u201cDeclassification cannot occur unless designated officials follow specified procedures,\u201d the court said, citing Obama\u2019s 2009 executive order in a footnote.\n\nFrom [Procedures for Declassifying Intelligence of Public Interest](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12183) \n\nExecutive Order\n\n&gt; The President has the authority to declassify documents in the public interest that originated in any department or agency of the executive branch. A recent example is Executive Order 14040, Declassification Reviews of Certain Documents Concerning the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on September 3, 2021. This executive order directed government departments and agencies that originated records pertaining to September 11 to conduct declassification reviews to disclose as much of this material as possible in the public interest.\n\nAnother example of declassification by executive order is [Trump declassification executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-declassification-certain-materials-related-fbis-crossfire-hurricane-investigation/) to declassify the elements of the crossfire hurricane investigation.",

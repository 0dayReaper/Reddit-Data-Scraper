I'll keep the secret intact.\nIt's simple arithmetic.\nIt's a story problem.\nIf a new car built by my company leaves Chicago traveling west at 60 miles per hour, and the rear differential locks up, and the car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside, does my company initiate a recall?\nYou take the population of vehicles in the field (A) and multiple it by the probable rate of failure (B), then multiply the result by the average cost of an out-of-court settlement (C).\nA times B times C equals X. This is what it will cost if we don't initiate a recall.\nIf X is greater than the cost of a recall, we recall the cars and no one gets hurt.\nIf X is less than the cost of a recall, then we don't recall.",

            "comment": "Interesting takeaways:\n- NHTSA judges a statistical human life as being worth $12.5M. Better be damn sure those calculations for both sides of that equation, the costs of a policy recommendation as well as risk probability, are done correctly\u2026 in this case it sounds like they have made pretty consistent blunders, all leaning in the same direction. Don\u2019t seem like random errors to me. Seems like deliberate falsification at worst, or negligence at best. What a disappointment.\n- This has been a known issue since the formation of the NHTSA, at which point the political and commercial interests immediately blocked appropriate oversight, and that trend has continued ever since.\n- Both rear and side collision guards are, and have been for quite some time, required elsewhere in the world. The U.S. is an outlier with this, and it has nothing to do with the \u201cunknowns\u201d or the costs. Sadly it\u2019s just simple greed and corruption.",

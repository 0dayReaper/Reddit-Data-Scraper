And turnout was about 54%, so 68% of eligible voters either didn\u2019t vote or voted for the Democratic candidate. \n\nSo if their jury is only 1/3rd Desantis voters to start with, it\u2019s super easy to filter out the MAGA extremists before the important business begins. They\u2019re terrible at disguising their bias. \n\nAlso the grand jury only needs a majority vote. They don\u2019t need to be unanimous.",

Each charge is very specific.  Since most counts can result in 10-20 years, they have to disprove all the evidence.  One guilty count can send him to prison for the rest of his life.",

You just talked before about committing to the rule of law,\u201d Bash asked. \n\n&gt;Pence replied that he \u201cwould just hope that there would be a way for them to move forward without the dramatic and drastic and divisive step of indicting a former President of the United States. We\u2019ve got to find a way to move our country forward and *restore confidence in equal treatment under the law in this country*. We really do.\u201d\n\nWhat?

Why in the last 25 years has gun ownership become a problem?  Seriously.  \n\nI agree with you that there is an underlying issue that needs to be talked about.  Do parents just suck at their jobs now?  Is it because both parents have to work?  Is it because socialization no longer works when you can not control information?\n\nI would have never considered murder/suicide as a solution to being bullied at school.  Why is it so prevalent now?  Is it video games that are developed to groom us for military service?  Is it because more children are culturally confused?  Is it because too many grownups are just overgrown toddlers that throw tantrums?  Is it because out of 40-50 years of relative comfort and tech advancement, we have become a bunch of entitled idiots that lash out when things don\u2019t go our way?\n\nProbably all of this.  Truth be told, many 18 year olds have almost another decade of life to go before they could be really considered \u201cadults\u201d.  Even insurance companies acknowledge this with extending coverage up to 26 years old.  Anyone in their late teens/early twenties don\u2019t want to hear this and I get it.  \n\nYes. A three year wait is a significant cooling off period if you are pissed off at a class mate.  Ideally, registration would lead to prosecution of using someone else\u2019s gun to commit a crime as well.  Maybe then, if a child has to ask to borrow the AR-15 on a Wednesday morning before school, mom and dad might find a counselor for their little failure before he ends his life by shooting up the school.",

How these parents even allow their little failures to just grab their assault rifles is fucking nuts. \n\nI for some reason feel some background on myself is important. I am a straight ticket Dem voter my whole life. But I own an assault rifle for home defense. Why? Because in the United States, the police don\u2019t have a legal duty to protect citizens from crime. My town is also only serviced by the state police who only patrol through the town once a night.

It worked, for the most part.\n\nGuns are a bit different.  They don\u2019t need to be continuously purchased to be useful.  Most gun families gift their kid their first gun and before 18 and they have access to the family guns for hunting and shooting.\n\nRaising the age to purchase at least means you can\u2019t just go buy a gun to shoot up a school.  Many of these shooters weaponized in the week(s) leading up.\n\nHigh school is this precious time where you don\u2019t know shit except what the system has spoon fed you hoping to turn you into a decent citizen.  You are still reliant on your parents for shelter and food (most likely) but your relationships with your fellow students are your entire world.  \n\nWhen this tiny world is devastated, you don\u2019t see a way out because it is all you know.  Options like killing your bully seems viable.  This is where parenting is supposed to take over, but for many it doesn\u2019t.  \n\nSo many believe that delaying the age to buy guns, will delay purchases until that time when you are actually making real world choices and can laugh at the jock that was bullying you.",

I think its feasible to potentially restrict the registration of guns till 21. That will prevent 18 year olds from going to the gun store and buying one outright\u2026 also it may make people who are gifting guns think twice\u2026 they can\u2019t register the gun to the 18 year old, so in a way they\u2019re still kinda on the hook if an 18 year old does things with the gun that was gifted. Sure, some people may say \u201cblack market gun trade will increase.\u201d But not without holding more people accountable. Like if I had a firearm, I would never just give it to someone including my own kid, without doing the proper paperwork, and properly severing all ties to the firearm itself. Maybe that\u2019s just me tho.",

The last time we did, they tore up our first constitution, the Article of Confederation, and wrote an entirely new constitution. There is a reason we have not had another convention. \n\nIt takes 2/3rds of the states (34 of the 50) to call for a constitutional convention. Several states have called for one in recent years. \n\nSome changes that I would expect would be defining marriage as between on man and one woman, saying life begins at conception, declaring Christianity the national religion with special privileges, making English the official language, requiring a balanced budget, stripping regulatory power from gov., ending citizenship based on being born on US soil, ending entitlements such as Social Security &amp; Medicare and future aspirations of gov. provided health insurance or college tuition, repealing the 16th amendment about income tax, and solidifying minority rule. \n\nIt takes three-fourths of the states (38 of the 50) to ratify the changes. Think of all of the small, rural, conservative states: Wyoming, N. Dakota, S. Dakota, Alaska, etc. Although a minority of the population might agree with these changes, a majority of the states may be able to ratify these changes.",

            "comment": "Right idea but dangerous approach.\n\nGovernor Newsom is proposing an Article V Constitutional Convention. From the Governor's official site:\r  \n\"Passage of the 28th Amendment will require a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also known as an **Article V Convention** or amendatory convention. Working in partnership with members of the California State Senate and Assembly, California will be the first state in the nation to call for such a convention with a joint resolution being introduced by California State Senator Aisha Wahab and Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer. The Governor will work with grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation to fight for the passage of similar resolutions in other state legislatures to ensure the convening of a constitutional convention limited to this subject. 33 other states, in addition to California, would need to take action to convene such a convention.\"\n\n\r  \nThere are literally no rules for actions that can be taken once a Convention is convened. Republicans have been pushing for it for a while now because they want to completely re-write the Constitution to their beliefs (ban on abortion, ban on any gun laws, ban on LGBTQ+ existence, ban on vaccinations, repeal of Social Security and Medicare, etc., etc., etc. ). **There is nothing in the Constitution that limits the Amendments to be considered by an Article V convention to a single subject**. Once convened it becomes a free for all. The lack of rules and procedures for a Constitutional Convention is one of the reasons it has never been successful since the first one.\n\n\r  \nArticle V, U.S. Constitution\r  \nArticle V\r  \n\"The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate\"\r  \n.An interesting read by the Congressional Research Service:\n\n\r  \n[https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42589/15#:\\~:text=The%20second%2C%20generally%20referred%20to,the%20Constitution%20to%20convene%20one](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42589/15#:~:text=The%20second%2C%20generally%20referred%20to,the%20Constitution%20to%20convene%20one).",

Do the criminals who use these guns seem like the type to abide by this? Is there any evidence that taking a fraction of a second to reload saves lives? The common way around this, even for law abiding citizens, is carry more mags which makes it kind of pointless, no?\n\nWhy does the pistol grip matter? What can be done with a pistol grip on a rifle that cannot be done with a standard grip? How does it make it more deadly?\n\nI get the argument against having a grenade launcher, but how many rifles used in mass shootings, or even criminal shootings, have had an actual grenade launcher? Something less than 1%.\n\nAlso, you have to ask, since suicides make up roughly 40% of gun deaths, this ban does nothing to touch those so is it really the best approach to go after a smaller proportion first?\n\nCriminals won't abide by it. Law enforcement gets an automatic pass (which typically includes retired). So that means it really only affects law abiding citizens without any clear benefit. But votes.",

What they are trying to ban is so vaguely defined it can include almost any type of firearm. The AR-15 is their chosen weapon to be against because the optics where it looks just like a gun the military uses is so easy. But it's not an assault rifle. \n\n\\&gt;We can be logical, reasonable humans, and draw lines about what makes sense\n\nCan you explain why the AR-15 is so problematic it needs to be banned? It's almost never being used in mass shooting. It functions in exactly the same fashion as many, many other 'sport' rifles, often even in the same calibers. The most common calibers its chambered in, .223/556, .22LR,  .300 blackout, are considered weak to medium strength rounds. The magazine capacity is no more than many other rifles such as the Ruger 10/22. So, other than options, what's the issue?\n\nOr are you meaning to ban all semi-automatic weapons as is lately being included in the \"assault weapons\" rhetoric.",

AR-15s are responsible for a vanishingly small amount of gun deaths each year despite being among the most popular guns. More people die from punches than AR-15s each year. They\u2019re chambered in an intermediate round which many states ban from hunting precisely because it\u2019s not as deadly as 30 caliber ammo. They have average accuracy and range (both which are primarily a function of barrel quality and length and usually hampered by how moduar the AR is along with the fact that it is a semi auto).  \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, an AR can be an excellent rifle because of reliability, safety, and cost. But it\u2019s not deadlier than any other rifle with the same barrel length and cartridge. \n\nIf we have 40,000 drunk driving deaths. 1,200 of those involved cars, the rest motorcycles. Does banning Honda Accords make any sense to you? This is precisely the argument against AWB.",

That is very different than what the first person was trying to claim. It's also very different that what you were saying in your first comment.\n\nAn AWB is in no way similar to how cars are regulated. We have some regulations related to what can be driven on roads but I can literally own a street legal tank and drive anywhere with enough height clearance. I can also own stuff that isn't street legal at all. And put mufflers on everything. In fact I can be fined if I don't have them on the street legal cars. A ban would absolutely stop me from owning the thing that's banned. It's absurd to argue otherwise. It not somehow fine just because not everything is banned.\n\nDon't worry you can still pretend no one needs X or Y thing you think is scary in your gated community.

He just did so much messaging damage to the D platform that it's actually astonishing that Dems haven't learned that guns are almost universally off limits due to how many people view them as self defense tools. All this does is drive people out to buy more firearms, increasing the proliferation, and costing the Dems otherwise easily obtained support amongst moderates.\n2. Most of the mandates in this bill are already federal law. This amendment wouldn't actually do anything to curb gun related crime. In fact it would actually cause those numbers to rise because there's no grandfather notion in it, meaning that someone who legally purchased a gun at 18, is now in violation of the law. Retroactively incriminating people just to score some brownie points with people who refuse to actually address the core issue just costs valuable political capital as stated in point 1.",

Imagine state electors having equal say and tinkering with the laws and protections we have on the books at this moment.\n\nHow do you think this favors a Democratic/leftist view on everything from religious freedoms (and freedom from religious dogma) to education to gun rights to immigration to minority rights to women's rights to just about every opinion/cause that is favored by the majority of voters but not the majority of \"land represented\"?\n\nThat's a path to right-wing extremism/anti-democracy just opened up for the MAGA crowd with zero chance to box them in when an actual Constitutional Convention comes about.

Canada abandon its long gun registry because that doesnt happen. New york amd maryland tried building bullet and casing traxe programs to make that happen. They were also abandoned as expensive failures. Tracing rarely if ever results in any convictions ir solving of crimes like murder.",

            "comment": "\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nSorry Ronny but this is what it says and there\u2019s nothing about SELF defense in there although I agree it would have been part of the intent. It is setting up a \u201cwell regulated\u201d militia to help bluster the regular army AND defend the population against potential threats from our own government. The intent here is to have a populous that can bluster the regular army in times of distress and incase our own government should rise against us. It\u2019s an extension of Americans distrust of standing armies combined with their own experience with unfair treatment from the Crown and its standing army. It is indeed intended for personal defense but it is primarily intended to have a \u201cwell regulated militia\u201d. It says nothing directly about \u201cself defense\u201d and again I know the history and it is part of that BUT it was obviously PRIMARILY the defense of the people from potential threats from their own government and from foreign powers. You can\u2019t be \u201cwell regulated\u201d if you don\u2019t train to the plan so that means they intended us to maintain a basic skill level. They  intended to be able to draw from the general population a \u201cman at arms\u201d with a rudimentary skill level in arms and a rudimentary training in disciplined battlefield movement and how to take orders. America had very little money when the country started and they didn\u2019t trust their previous government so they thought of a good way to have a minimum standing army and be able to draw up an army in time of need that could perform the very basics and be a bluster to the minimal standing army they had to keep for border protection and trade protection at minimum. It wasn\u2019t until WWII the US realized it needed a massive standing army because it took too much time to tool up for war and modern warfare happened to fast to build up a force and they had to be a professional force. We had to be ready all the time. Eisenhower tells us that in his \u201cMilitary Industrial Complex\u201d speech. \n\n\u201cAmerican makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions\u2026\u201d - Eisenhower\n\nAlso, it\u2019s my opinion the \u201cassault weapon\u201d isn\u2019t the issue (shape doesn\u2019t matter) it\u2019s the number of rounds that\u2019s the issue. All conventionally manufactured and conventionally used firearms are intended to kill. Obviously they make some weapons that are not but the vast majority are designed to kill. A single shot assault weapon is just exactly as effective as a single shot weapon of any kind, of the same caliber, etc., designed to kill if you see what I mean? The restriction better be the magazine capacity because a person practiced in the use of a bolt action rifle that can carry 100 rounds can lay down some wicked firepower if you see what I\u2019m getting at? The focus should be magazine capacity not how the gun \u201clooks\u201d or if it\u2019s even semiautomatic. I personally see no need for the general population to own a fully automatic weapon BUT I will add that the Founding Fathers likely would not agree. My guess is they fully would intend to arm the population, at that time, with the same rifle the average foot soldier carried into battle. That\u2019s the debate for the legislative bodies. The intent, in my opinion, was for the average person to be TRAINED to use a military rifle. I emphasize again, TRAINED.",

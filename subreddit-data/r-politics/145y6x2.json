As opposed to the many other Islamic terrorists who blew up the world trade centre and other organized attacks for geopolitical reasons. \n\nYou can call him an Islamic terrorist. I don\u2019t really mind. But I think it\u2019s giving him more credit than he deserves.",

Even though Mateen's political beliefs were erratic (he claimed he was in both Hezbollah and ISIS even though those groups aren't even the same *sect* of Islam) he had a very clear and obvious hatred of gay people (his own father is very homophobic and recalled witnessing his son wretch at the sight of a gay couple kissing). Mateen also had clear admiration for violent anti-gay groups like ISIS (even if he was clearly not a member as he claimed). Oddly for an Islamic extremist, he also seemed to have a strong hatred of Hispanic people. The Pulse club was hosting a 'Latin Night' event catering to locals (Orlando is a mostly Hispanic city which Mateen traveled to from hours away).\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing. It is a fact that Pulse was not Mateen's first target (he scouted Disney World before realizing how tight their security is), but that doesn't change the hatred he held towards gays. Next time try arguing that the Pittsburgh shooter wasn't an anti-Semite.",

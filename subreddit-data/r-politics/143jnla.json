They did have mandatory requirements for volunteering and gave various options to attain the hours (cleaning up trash, helping at food banks and such). Maybe the Jesuits are a little different in teaching approach. I am not Catholic and there were plenty of non-Christians at my school including Jewish, Muslim or the \"I don't care group\" like me.

Something you do on Sunday and don\u2019t really talk about much the rest of the week. As a teen, I was really active in the church youth group and it is where most of my closest friends came from (even today in my 40\u2019s some of my best friends are from this same group). As an adult, I became a Chreaster churchgoer (only really went to service on Christmas and Easter) and maybe a bit here and there in between but again, church was just something you did for an hour once a week. Bible study, weekly/daily prayer and all that stuff just wasn\u2019t part of my upbringing or something I cared about in adulthood. \n\nThen, the rise of toxic Christian nationalism completely turned me off of organized religion over the last 5 years or so. I am now at a point in my life where I am internally debating with myself between feeling agnostic or atheist, but can\u2019t decide. My wife and I both grew up in conservative Christian homes and now we are 100% the opposite. We still have \u201ckids bibles\u201d and we generally don\u2019t mind if our elementary school age kids read them and if they want to talk about it, we talk to them about people believing lots of different things and it is up to them to someday decide what they believe. Naturally, my wife and I\u2019s parents are horrified with us, but they are both part of that toxic Christian national wave and so the worse they feel about us, the better I think we are doing. \n\nIt is definitely hard to feel cut off from your previous immediate family and very emotionally draining to have completely changed my religious and political views so drastically. I know deep down I am finally seeing the world in the right way, but I do sometimes feel stress and anxiety that I no longer have the same relationship with my extended family. I have to remind myself that they are shunning me for believing something different, not the other way around.",

Am I allowed to think up what might be? Sure. Am I ever going to force it on anyone? No.\n\nGiven that, I then think about what my personal values are: if this blip of life is all we have, then I want it to be in the best environment possible and I want my legacy to be a better blip of life for any other being that gets this experience.\n\nAm I great at doing that? Not in big ways but in a small circle. Can I be better at doing that? Yes and that is what I strive for.",

The religious right in this country focus a ton on immigrants/Muslims replacing them but they don't think about how they're daily eroding their own positions by forcing their beliefs onto others, including how forcing their beliefs onto their children could turn them off of religion for life.",

No one even told me that only Catholics (or even only Christians) go to heaven. No one told me science was wrong. We were taught to love and respect people. During my education for Communion and Confirmation, they were very clear about what it means to be Catholic and that it was 100% okay to decide you don't believe that. Even so, I didn't end up a practicing Catholic. I went through the whole process to please my family, but I was never a believer. I'm an agnostic atheist. \n\nThe thing that actually made me reject religion is what a big pile of shit the Bible is (for reasons unique to the Bible and for things inherent to all religions). It wasn't even compatible with what the church had told is was good. Slavery? War? Genocide? Xenophobia? An absolute dick head of a god? Fuck all that noise. This wasn't a holy book. It was a book extremely convenient to the slave owners and assholes that wrote it. Give me the Sermon on the Mount and the rest of it can kick rocks. \n\nTL;DR Teach your kid right from wrong and then show them the Bible. They'll be disgusted by it.",

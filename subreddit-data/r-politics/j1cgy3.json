You can only deduct it if the style is purely for work, like say if you needed some crazy hairdo as an actor for a scene but got it fixed after shooting.\n\nTrump having his hair done in the way he normally does it for a TV show isn\u2019t deductible.  It also wouldn\u2019t be deductible if you had a business and got your hair done to shoot a commercial.  It\u2019s just one of those things you can\u2019t deduct.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve posted a statement from the IRS about the deductibility of hair styling and similar elements in some replies, but here it is in the parent comment:\n\n\u201cTaxpayers in the entertainment industry sometimes incur unusually high expenses to maintain an image. These expenses are frequently related to the individual's appearance in the form of clothing, make-up, and physical fitness. Other expenses in this area include bodyguards and limousines. These are generally found to be personal expenses as the inherently personal nature of the expense and the personal benefit far outweigh any potential business benefit.\n\nNo deduction is allowed for wardrobe, general make-up, or hair styles for auditions, job interviews, or \u2018to maintain an image.\u2019\u201d\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/entertainmentatg.pdf\n\nAnd here\u2019s a court case where a similar issue came up and the court ruled quite explicitly that hair and clothing was not deductible as a business expense:\n\nhttps://www.leagle.com/decision/intco20110224e52\n\nIf you still don\u2019t believe this, call up a CPA and ask them.  Any of them will confirm this.",

And the fact that I know so much, is pretty outstanding. So many dudes saying you don't *need* a $250 dollar cut.\n\nIf you *want* to have your hair look a certain way, you *need* to have somebody do it for you.\n\nMaybe this analogy will help you.\n\nIf you *want* your car upgraded/fixed/whatever, chances are you will *need* to pay somebody to do it for you, correctly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, for women to be taken seriously in a professional capacity, they need to look a certain way, I don't agree with it, but that is my understanding of it. Its going to cost money to make sure your brows, hair, makeup, ect look right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: The fact that I'm still getting messages that \"a $250 haircut is fucking stupid\" or \"women dont need xyz\" shows just out of touch some men are. I urge you to learn more about your female counterparts, it will help you grow as a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Just because of the overwhelming support of this post I told my wife to schedule a hair appointment because she hasn't had one since the lockdowns.",

If AOC gets hers messed up, do you think the right would even tolerate her having a pixie cut or something? They would just implode. Not that they haven't imploded already, just, it's just making it easy for them to point out things their members don't like.",

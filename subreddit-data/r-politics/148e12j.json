Trump told my relative he wanted to buy the building (for a really cheap price), but when my relative told Trump it wasn\u2019t for sale Trump told my relative that he was friends with someone downtown that would condemn the building if my relative didn\u2019t sell it to him &amp; he would buy the building at the courthouse after condemnation for pennies. My relative knew the building was in great shape &amp; didn\u2019t want to give it away to Trump, so he told Trump \u201cNo.\u201d Trump then proceeded to scream at my relative that my relative is going to lose the building, he\u2019s getting his Lawyers involved, my relative is basically screwed, and then he hung up the phone.\n\nYou know what happened next? Nothing. Trump was bluffing, did absolutely nothing, and moved on to the next victim. That was one of the ways Trump acquired so much real estate! Fear. He forced immoral, untrue, fear upon people to get them to sell him property for nothing, so he could make money off them.\n\nI knew I wasn\u2019t going to vote for Trump the moment he ran, because I couldn\u2019t vote for such an immoral person.",

My dad had a similar story, friend of his was approached by Trump for some kind of business deal. Trump wanted stuff up front, made all sorts of promises. Guy said \"I'm not working on anything until there is a signed deal\" Trump refused to sign anything and moved on. \n\nPeople knew even back then how he operated. Use his fame to get people to do shit before any payment or agreement is signed, just handshakes and promises. He gets what he wants and then refuses to pay what he agreed to.\n\nPretty sure during the 2016 campaign there was an interview with a family business that went under because they didn't get a signature and took his word on the agreement. But like everything, his supporters just heard what they wanted and ignored this, or said \"tHaT mAkEs hIm sMaRt\"",

Its like when they support bad people when they're athletes for their favorite team.

To do so would force themselves to internally admit to some harsh truths about their behaviors.\n\nThey are also very anti drug in public but they don't realize that they are addicted to hate. And they are raised to suppress their feelings and just box them away so good luck dropping their egos. I would be willing to bet many of his supporters are co-dependents with narcissists, straight up narcissists, or grew up in an environment similar to that but thats just a hypothesis.",

This is the one thing I'm actually convinced will bring him down, because the CIA pretty openly admits that it used to (and probably still does/would) essentially just kidnap and murder people who leaked the kind of information Trump leaked. The dept of defense does not fuck around, and is not going to half ass (or let the DOJ half ass) the prosecution here. They aren't going to let him stall and delay indefinitely. \n\nThis isn't like the impeachments, where the jury was Lindsay Graham and Ted Cruz, or the civil cases where the penalty is money. Trump stole, leaked and potentially even sold top secret info including our nuclear capabilities. You might as well compare a parking ticket to murder charges, except there's an audio recording where you discussed committing the murder and exactly which laws you'd be breaking to do so.",

But the short answer is perhaps about 20 years, give or take a decade, according to one former national security prosecutor who crunched the numbers. \n\nTo be more precise, Trump may face between 17-and-a-half and 22 years for just the criminal counts related to willfully retaining national security documents, based on a careful review of the charges and federal sentencing guidelines performed by former federal prosecutor David Aaron. Trump could also be sentenced to another seven-and-one-quarter to nine years for the other counts in the indictment, including obstruction of justice. \n\n At 76 years old, Trump is staring down the possibility of a criminal sentence that could send him to some form of incarceration for the rest of his natural life, if he loses this case.  \n\nLink to the full article: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bbya/donald-trump-prison-sentence](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bbya/donald-trump-prison-sentence)",

If he is a billionaire why leave these documents in bathrooms or ballrooms? If he is so smart why travel with them? Why go through all of the stuff you bring to FL after your Presidency ended and select a few of the files to take to New Jersey with you? Why would you bring them to the meeting with Mark Meadows aide and ghost writer? When he was President he did not like people taking notes (as discussed in the Special Counsel report on Russia) and he never likes being recorded. So in this meeting with people he doesn\u2019t need to impress he has classified documents and knows he is being recorded. Yet he shows the classified documents, tells them they are classified, tells them he can\u2019t show them because they are classified, says as President he could have declassified them but not now because he\u2019s not President (admits he lost the election) and then tells them what is in the folder. In less then 5 minutes he admitted he doesn\u2019t have the power to declassify, that he can\u2019t show them or discuss them because they are classified and then shows and discusses them while being recorded. \n\nIt is baffling that he would be so dumb. The evidence isn\u2019t \u201cpeople are saying\u201d it\u2019s recorded by people in his inner circle. He knew it was being recorded and he knew it wasn\u2019t okay what he was doing. That\u2019s on him not you, unless you support it. \n\nThere are plenty of candidates that would love your support. The Biden campaign isn\u2019t saying let\u2019s lock up Trump, that was Trumps slogan and some of you have that bumper sticker. They don\u2019t see the indictment as a path to earning your vote. So find a new \u201cMAGA\u201d leader. One that won\u2019t risk your Party\u2019s and your integrity to impress someone. One that won\u2019t violate the law. \n\nLastly, what about Biden? If you have evidence of his wrongdoing watch how fast he is shown the door. Liberals are not in a cult that sinks with the boat. They booted a comedian turned elected official because of an inappropriate joke he made while on the USO tour.  No one was harmed, the National Security wasn\u2019t at risk, it happened before he was elected. They dethroned Pelosi recently.",

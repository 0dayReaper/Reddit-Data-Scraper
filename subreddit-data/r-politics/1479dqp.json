But acknowledging that would mean all these MAGA people made a mistake and supported a criminal and they can't come to terms with that.  OR they are pure fascists who support Trump and even if they know he committed crimes, its still worth it because he's making the people who deserve to be hurt, hurt.  They just don't say it out loud.\n\n/s",

They are now fueling ignorant legislative changes to tick culture war boxes, some are running for government positions themselves, and they believe they are on a moral crusade and that trump was sent by god to answer their prayers.  \n\nIt\u2019s a religious cult at this point, and Donald Trump is their leader. The enabling by Republican officials due to their own self interest only allows this to go on longer and for more vulnerable people to get swept up into the chaos.  \n\nWe saw what mob mentality looked like on January 6th. People are still made about that along with a whole new amount of bullshit. Some believe liberal ideologies are ruining America, and others have taken it a step further and saying god is punishing us because of the sin we have allowed and welcomed into the nation (the LGBTQ community), and anyone who supports them is a pedophile or a groomer.  \n\nThese people are a literal powder keg who have been told through various messaging sources that they need to buy guns and stock up on supplies\u2026 they are an effing powder keg right now. So yeah, to me, it\u2019s absolutely terrifying.",

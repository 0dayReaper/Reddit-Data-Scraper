He was already indicted on three felony charges in 2015 and his fellow Republicans and their voters in Texas were apparently entirely fine with that.   Since then,  8 years I will point out,  the case has just been bouncing all over Texas with multiple venue changes approved by Republican judges.    Hopefully being removed from power will let that finally catch up to him as well.  Just process that,  in Texas, it's fine if your Attorney General, the top lawyer in the entire state, is indicted for multiple felonies.  And then it's also okay if he abuses his position to not be held accountable for those felonies. \n\nAnd that's not even what he was impeached for!  It's entirely unrelated!\n\nMan, I need to get out of this state.",

My fear is that if we don't draw the line in the sand, these policies won't stop at red states. As more and more liberals move to blue states, we're liable to just end up with more red states.  Iowa and Ohio are basically red at this point as is Florida.  \n\nArizona went blue in 2020, but how long will that last once Republicans get enough control of their state government to start pushing anti-LGBTQ and anti-choice legislation through, forcing another blue exodus?  Same for Nevada and North Carolina.  Eventually, there will be enough red states for a Republican supermajority in the US senate, and then these fucked up policies will become federal law.\n\nI will draw my line in this West Texas dust. I was born in that dust, and I will be buried in it, even if I'm the last Democrat left in this state.",

How are they going to come at Trump, while they themselves enable him, supported him, agreed with him, defended him  and emulated him the entire time. \n\nI wager all the attacks against Trump will be that he didn't go \"far enough\" like firing fauci, or was responsible for shutdowns and the vaccines. They'll try and argue that Trump wasn't trumpy enough to \"save America\"",

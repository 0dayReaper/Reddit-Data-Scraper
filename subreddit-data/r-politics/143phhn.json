This penalty should be 100x that, if it is truly something we want to prevent in the future.  And yes, we really really do want to prevent this.",

If the policies of the democratic party are so bad then just present them truthfully, and it should be enough to get your voters angry and engaged. The problem for the GOP is that when presented factually policies from the left are overwhelmingly popular with the entire electorate left right, and center. It's one of the reasons that republicans campaign on their culture war. If they just campaigned on policy then they would have to convince middle class voters, which make up most of their constituency, that tax breaks for the rich, and corporations are in their best interest.",

That's a serious felony RIGHT THERE.\n\nLess charitable interpretations of his actions put him in a much, much worse place. The continuum of outcomes range from devastating to catastrophic.",

Biden was even worse, but they didn\u2019t get Indicted and, unlike them, **I never gave a foreign power anything. Biden probably did. He gave to China because China gave him a lot of money?**\n\nRemember that Trump *always* accuses others of his own worst offenses, then re-read that bolded part. Yikes.",

His narcissism and personality disorder is so severe, he can\u2019t help but instinctively and impulsively project and lie, the way a 5 year old would who\u2019s just figured out lying can be very useful. If you\u2019ve ever met and spent enough time with a narcissist, it\u2019s very easy to recognise their habits and patterns.\n\nA 5 year old doesn\u2019t possess the frame of reference to understand that having knowledge of the details of what they\u2019re lying about, is enough for anyone outside looking in to see they\u2019re clearly lying. Trump is no different, he\u2019s a simpleton and he\u2019s woefully under qualified in mental faculties and skills to work with information, let alone run the country. \n\nHis supporters love him because they can relate to him. They\u2019re also often extremely insecure, unintelligent and manipulated very easily. The real tragedy is there\u2019s so many of these people around, their voting impacts the rest of the *world*",

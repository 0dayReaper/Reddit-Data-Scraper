Endlessly harassed and if they say nothing and try to ignore them the conservatives walk away strutting how they \"owned a lib\" if they argue it quickly devolves in debating whats fact or not.

The igniting event was the assassination of the Hutu president (responsibility for who caused the plane crash that killed him is still disputed). \n\n\nWhen things exploded in April of 1994, it led to 100 days of unimaginable violence, with anywhere from 400,000 to 800,000 Tutsis killed and as many as 500,000 Tutsi women brutally raped. Nobody over a certain age in that country wasn\u2019t affected one way or another. \nWhen I was last there in 2009, bodies were still being found and their remains committed to the memorial communal graves at the center. Neighbors killed neighbors. People killed loved ones. To the Hutus, nothing was as sacred as their loyalty to their group - this label slapped on them generations prior.\n\n\nThat museum etched things into my soul. I cannot help but see parallels with what happened in Rwanda and what is happening in America\u2019s political and social sphere today. I\u2019m not saying I expect a genocide, but the manipulation and animosity we are brewing is starting to boil over into something awful. In both cases, the sowing of this division is just so meaningless, manipulative, dumb\u2026 and dangerous.\n\nOne thing that did come of all the terrible violence is that Rwandans have now given up their Hutu/ Tutsi/ Twa identifiers. Ask most people there what they are- Hutu or Tutsi - and they\u2019ll say \u201cI am Rwandan\u201d. There was a massive effort to stitch the remnants of the society back together. Victims and small councils would face their accusers. The guilty would participate in community services, sometimes alongside their victims. Victims accepted apologies. As hard as it must have been, both sides worked very hard to come together as one in a spirit of forgiveness, atonement, and umbutu: unity. There\u2019s an African proverb: \u201cUmuntu ngumuntu ngabantu\u201d: To be human is to recognize the humanity of others. After so much hate and violence and generations of division, what I saw Rwandans creating - and working towards that spirit of umbutu - was astounding and inspiring.",

It's not that he was closeted per se, it's just that it never really came up in TOS and even in the original movies when it came out that Sulu had a daughter we never saw his partner. In the TOS show he for sure hit on women and his character was likely bi if anything. It's more of a retcon that Sulu was gay because Takei has become such a LGBT activist more than anything else.\n\nBut you're absolutely right that Star Trek has always been woke. The prime example of that has always been the episode where they have the aliens that are half black and half white that are trying to destroy each other because what side the blackness/whiteness is on is somehow of vital importance. If you can't look at the date that came out and make a connection then there's no hope.",

The one thing I hope they never do is imply Sulu was in the closet.  Takei had enough of that in his real life as a Hollywood star.\n\nAlso, the half-black half-white aliens hold a special place in my heart for being *so* damn ham-handed.  They're a perfect example of how Star Trek has always had a progressive voice, sometimes a blatantly obvious one, but also a reminder that not every episode is good just because it's well intentioned.  (Though I think some people liked it more than I did.)",

They loudly proclaim they're the will of the land, but they're only in power now because of technicalities, manipulating laws (gerrymandering, voter roll purges, reducing/limiting ways of voting) and young generations that are not voters.\n\nMost of America is not in favor of most of the hateful policies of the fringe that leads Congress. \n\nBut social change takes decades. In my mother's generation, they started working on civil rights and women's rights. In my generation, it was gay rights. In my son's generation, it appears to be transgender rights so far. And we're still battling over civil and women's and gay rights, but we're a lot farther than we were a few decades ago. Progress is slow and not linear, but as long as we vote for empathic candidates, it will progress.\n\nSomeday MAGA rallies will be pictured in history as \"positively\" as people who didn't want women to vote or Nazi rallies or people who blocked civil rights marches and school integration. In the future, few people will ever brag that great-great-grandma bought Trump memorabilia. And we will remember the people who fought for rights and empathy for all.\n\nCan we crowdfund a Bernie Sanders bronze statue yet? Kudos points if it's Inauguration Bernie with the mittens. ;P",

            "comment": "Last week, conservative political commentator Meghan Mccain wrote an article for the Daily Mail about one of the more pressing issues of our time, the one-off appearance of Samantha, played by Kim Cattrall, in HBO's reboot of \"Sex and the City.\" \n\nNow, there is nothing wrong with people who usually spend their time gazing into the fiery abyss of our political landscape deciding to tackle lighter material but unfortunately that's not what this piece was. The first sentence of the headline of her article is, \"I couldn't bear to watch the woke-fest Sex And The City reboot ruin the show I loved\u2026\" \n\nIf you have a somewhat healthy relationship with your family and social media you may be asking yourself what exactly is a woke-fest and how exactly is it affecting Mccain's viewing experience? \n\nThe answer to that question, I believe, is summed up in this quote from her piece: \"This was a global-hit show that used to revel in its rebelliousness \u2013 always most apparent in Samantha, who dropped the F-word every other sentence, called women 'b**ches' and memorably once remarked: 'I'm a try-sexual. I'll try anything once.'\" \n\nIf what you take from those sentences is that the problem is that McCain is having a hard time connecting to the show because of its lack of slurs and casual misogyny, then we are on the same page. Mccain goes on to complain about the inclusion of some LGBTQ characters and it's at this point where things begin to click about what her actual problem is. Still, how does any of this equate to a so-called woke-fest? \n\nThere are few words or phrases that have received more bastardization and criticism than the word \"woke.\" Like so many artifacts of American culture, the term originated in predominantly Black spaces. Its origins have been traced as far back as the 60's but for our intents and purposes let's look at its modern resurgence throughout the 2010s and its present day usage. \n\nAmong Black people, the term is used to describe a state of awareness of material surroundings. A person who is described as woke has a pretty good sense of the political realities they live under without varying into conspiracy theory territory.\n\nThat concept of a \"woke\" person in contemporary usage \u2014 as conservatives and reactionary centrists have hijacked the term \u2014basically boils down to Black,  brown or queer people merely existing. Many people online and in political left-leaning spaces have joked that woke is basically a stand-in for anything conservatives don't like, while this is largely true there is a bit more of an insidious side to this simple answer.  Anything that even minorly pushes back on White Supremacist or patriarchal values is up for being branded as \"woke.\"\n\nThere are few words or phrases that have received more bastardization and criticism than the word \"woke.\"\n\nFor example, look at the strange proxy war that presidential hopeful Ron Desantis is waging in Florida against Disney. At its core Disney is as conservative as Ron Desantis or any Republican, putting its workers in horrid conditions and even donating to the Florida GOP. \n\nThis is of course because they are a corporation; it is their prerogative to have both sides of the aisle more inclined to support their future ventures, regardless of the harm it could cause to marginalized groups or the environment. \n\nDespite this reality, Desantis branded the company \"Woke Disney\" in the wake of their opposition to his aptly derided \"Don't Say Gay\" bill banning the discussion of sexuality or gender identity in Florida's public schools. \n\nThe fight between DeSantis and Disney  gets at the heart of the usage of the word \"woke.\" Reactionaries like Desantis have been able to use culture war issues as a way to distract and galvanize the disenfranchised portions of their constituencies. \n\nKnowing that the majority of their reactionary policies are wildly unpopular, reactionaries muddy the waters any way they can.  In most circumstances, they use these culture wars as a mask to keep business moving as usual but as of late, the reactionaries have run to curtail business interest. \n\nThis turn comes as we see more and more workers around the country realize that the current construction of our workplaces is not tenable and businesses scramble to appease them in any way possible (outside of legitimate change).  \n\nSo, we have on one hand corporations that would like to gain public good will by lightly supporting progressive causes,  and on the other conservatives who understand that just calling those businesses woke is enough to get them to back down on their \"beliefs\" because they surely aren't deeply held.\n\nThis tactic of making money and gaining exposure by playing to the already established hierarchies we live under extends from our presidential candidates to the absolutely sweatiest man you've ever seen screaming in your Tik Tok feed. \n\nThis is the same thread that Meghan Mccain decided to latch on to in her petty gripe of a review of the \"Sex and the City\" reboot. By branding people and products as woke and stripping the word of any of its original meaning, conservatives are able to ascribe any characteristics they like to the identities without varying too far into the white supremacist dog whistles that by now sound more like bullhorns. \n\nBeing able to weaponize the word woke gives reactionaries the opportunity to grandstand on each and every issue \u2014 crucially charging up their base \u2014regardless of how seemingly insignificant it may be. From M&amp;M's to Nascar, Fox News, for instance, has worked its audience into outrage over 200 different things the network has labeled \"woke.\" Talk about a \"woke-fest.\"\n\nThere is hope, however, that this isn't a sustainable trend. \n\nAccording to a recent USA Today poll, a majority of Americans surveyed have a positive view of the word \"woke.\" This seems like a direct connection to the Republican willingness to label any and everything that provides the average American joy as woke. \n\nThe word has become a strange mixture of every fear and anxiety of the most bigoted of those in our political sphere mixed in with the hope of the brightest spots of our possible future. Regardless, it seems that Mccain and conservatives of the like are determined to use it to push whatever hateful rhetoric they deem acceptable to spew. \n\nDespite their efforts, so far, the reactionaries have seemingly spread themselves too thin and their inability to actually hold a consistent set of beliefs has left more people than ever really wondering what it actually means to be \"woke.\"\n\nEdit: formatting - these giant paragraphs are so hard to read, broke them up a bit.",

In its reading, woke corporate elites are scheming in boardrooms to push the culture in a more progressive direction against the wishes of disempowered, silent culturally conservative majorities. That\u2019s why right-wing figures have trained their fire on \u201cwoke corporations,\u201d often insisting this justifies the use of state power against them.\n\n&gt; In reality, corporations are acting in response to the broader culture.

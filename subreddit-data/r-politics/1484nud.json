Public defenders won\u2019t have those as a rule because they\u2019re expensive to obtain and a pain in the ass to maintain. And the lawyers that DO have them tend to be extremely serious about their professions and not at all interested in taking clients who don\u2019t listen, much less clients with a history of getting counsel in trouble. \n\nThis is going to generate other issues for Trump as well. This isn\u2019t a routine white collar case, or a civil case, or a divorce, or any of the other myriad of lawsuits he\u2019s familiar with. He\u2019s not allowed to talk about the evidence, or even to look like he\u2019s *about* to talk about the evidence. That way lies additional charges, and even lawyers losing their very expensive security clearances. \n\nHe\u2019s going to struggle to find a lawyer, and then once he does if he loses one it will be virtually impossible to find another. The court might well have to appoint one.",

There are also procedural considerations, because this isn\u2019t the sort of trial you can just change counsel on mid-stream. Not only is the sheer volume of evidence going to make starting fresh prohibitively difficult, but with this level of classification you don\u2019t want more eyes on it than absolutely necessary. \n\nThe judge would likely identify and interview several potential candidates and tell them look, I don\u2019t *want* to force anyone, but if no one volunteers, I\u2019ll have to. \n\nAnd either way, Trump will probably try to fire counsel deep into the trial as a delaying/stalling tactic. If counsel hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, the right judge will stand up to him and say \u201cWe\u2019re already deep into trial. If you want to continue without counsel you can, but we can\u2019t set this aside for months and months. You have 90 days, then we proceed with or without counsel.\u201d Or some such. The currently appointed judge\u2026will not do that. DOJ is surely just waiting for the first even slightly controversial decision, at which point they\u2019ll ask that she be replaced. \n\nThis has \u201cinevitable appeals all the way to SCOTUS\u201d written all over it. Both because of the judge and because of the behavior of the accused. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if SCOTUS declines to grant cert though. There\u2019s no fundamental constitutional questions in play so far.",

A possible defense strategy could be to question every detail of the evidence and the propriety of its collection and admission. Enough questioning could persuade a jury member to have reasonable doubt about Trump's guilt if key evidence is ruled inadmissible. There's another strategy where the defense will attempt to delay the case at every opportunity where Trump could potentially be reelected, temporarily make his vice president the president and have them pardon him. In my opinion, the defense is most likely going to try to get the case declared a mistrial with prejudice over any number of technicalities.",

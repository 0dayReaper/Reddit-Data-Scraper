Trademark law has a kind of built-in bulwark against selective enforcement in that way.  If you're not consistently going after others playing on your trademark,  a future infringer can bring that up in court as a defense, and you can loose the right to protect your trademark altogether.  Not weighing in on whether that's right or wrong- it's complicated, but it's how it works.",

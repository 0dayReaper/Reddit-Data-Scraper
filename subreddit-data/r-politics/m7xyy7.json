And the higher the pretensions of such power, the more dangerous I think it both to rulers and to the subjects. Hence Theocracy is the worst of all governments. If we must have a tyrant a robber barron is far better than an inquisitor. The baron\u2019s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity at some point may be sated; and since he dimly knows he is doing wrong he may possibly repent. But the inquisitor who mistakes his own cruelty and lust of power and fear for the voice of Heaven will torment us infinitely more because he torments us with the approval of his own conscience and his better impulses appear to him as temptations",

As sad as it sounds, Jewish conspiracy theories are the most established conspiracy theories there are.\n\nMeaning that we would need to find a new topic that is in a similar vain but crazier. Not Muslims, since the fear of Muslim people has been there since at least 2001. Cults are too valid in their craziness. So we would need an entirely new population group, that is not yet established in the mainstream right wing hate. How about native Americans? As part of revenge. \n\nSpace lasers is obviously so far out of the world that to top it off, we would need something even more outlandish. Actual martians? Deep earth cave industrial complex? Hidden base in the mariana trench? \n\n\nNative Americans have banded together with left wing green earth groups and actually attack American institutions, both symbolic and actual, and American countries via a deep hidden cave system below the earth. That is why we have massive floods in regions that didn't have them before. Thats why the weather is seemingly crazy, because they are controlling it. That is why we have more tsunamis, because they actually start them in the mariana trench. \n\nWhy? To control us politically. False Flags attacks!!",

People like this believe in things like Divine Right, the infallibility of religious leaders, and most importantly, a divine order. This order is sometimes referred to as a natural order but that is a lie.\n\nWhat they are afraid of is the fact that there is no order at all in the world or universe. We humans don't occupy some privileged position let alone have individuals which are gifted with being born with such. This is a terror to their minds. That there is nothing more than random happenstance to the means and methods of this life. If this is true, they ask, then what keeps you from hurting others in any way you can?\n\nThe answer is that we don't hurt others because we don't want to.\n\nThe real question is why do they want to hurt others based on their imagined sky fathers (or mothers depending on where they're from)?",

Once a certain percentage of the population is living in squalor, the society no longer becomes sustainable without government intervention.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there are only two options to deal with those suffering and that is to provide for those less off or control them through force. It is basically a tug of war between Socialist based policies and Fascist based policies. Republicans are constantly pushing towards the divide and conquer of Fascism, while Democrats push for assistance and compassion of Socialism.\n\nPeople who believe that there is a finite amount of success, money, and power tend to lean Conservative and push for the Fascist and Authoritarian based policies because they believe that by attacking others, they improve their own situation. On the other hand, you have people who believe that the better the people around you do, the more opportunity that brings in for yourself. They want others to do better because in the end, your neighbors success helps your own.\n\nedit: I also think that a large portion of the Boomer generation is suffering from lead poisoning from lead in gas, paint, etc. while they were growing up.  There is a strong correlation between lead usage and increases in violence and cognitive decline. It is also thought that heavy lead usage contributed to the fall of the Roman empire.",

However, those same judges get to determine the meaning of the amendments. They can be as corrupt as they wish, and it's extremely unlikely they'll ever be removed via impeachment.\n\nIt's been 220 years since they unilaterally granted themselves this power, which is not in the Constitution, and other U.S. political figures who figured prominently in the early Republic era, and were in power during the decision, [completely opposed judicial review](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-15-02-0014).",

The GOP represents what conservatives have always been, the only difference is they now know they have permission to openly be their worst selves, to say the quiet part out loud. \n\nAnd they have that permission because centrists and moderates continue to defend conservatism as a whole, thus giving it credibility as a morally acceptable political ideology of \u201cdiffering\u201d opinion, rather than a politically-flavored theology for evil. \n\nAnd when conservatives have that credibility it means they can do or say anything, and it transforms from bigoted, cruel, selfish, hateful, or flat out evil into something \u201cpolitical\u201d. It\u2019s not evil when conservatives want to let poor people starve, or to work themselves to death for slave wages, or to force 13 year old rape victims to have a child, or to allow 16 year old girls to be raped and kidnapped by their 40 year old, religious \u201chusbands\u201d, or to genocide trans humans\u2026it\u2019s simply \u201cpolitical\u201d. Anyone refusing to acknowledge conservatism is morally irredeemable, is simply giving conservatism more credibility as socially acceptable, thus allowing them to do more and more evil while calling it \u201cpolitical\u201d.",

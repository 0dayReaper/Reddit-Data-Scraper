He's comparing a pride flag to a nazi flag and referencing Satanism with gay people. That's barely even coded language. \n\n&gt;Despite protests from residents, town leaders gave in to Danzinger\u2019s opposition in 2022, when he warned that raising the Pride flag would lead to political, religious, and Satanic groups requesting their flags also be flown. The mayor reportedly feared that, since the town did not have an official flag policy, they would end up yielding requests from groups wanting to fly flags bearing black crosses and swastikas.\n\nAs well, I lived on the North side of Miami Beach for 3 years, only a few miles south of Surfside (the Flanigans I would go to is in Surfside,  iykyk). There is a Chanukah Menorah parade that passes through the beaches, including Surfside. So this dumb strawman argument isn't even true.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that we live in a community where over one-third of the population is Jewish, yet the Town has never sponsored an Israeli Day Parade or a Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony,\u201d Danzinger said. \u201cAdditionally, over two-thirds of our population is Hispanic, yet we have never had a Hispanic Day Parade.

And, of course, shorting for more shares than actually exist, which opens you up for infinite loss.\n\nShort sales still shouldn't exist without tight regulation, though. They are currently a tool that allows people to successively sell for less and less, artificially depressing the value of a stock.\n\nWe used to have limitations, like until 2007 you couldn't sell short on a stock unless it was on an uptick from the previous sale.\n\nAnd we see where removing the rules got us.",

So it made it nearly impossible to make any profits in short term unless u had a large principal. Like if u bought $200 of stock it would have to go up in price by 20% just to break even.

I once won a football pool thing (you just pick which team would win, repeat every week for most total wins.) at the age of 12 or so playing with adults. I picked teams based on \"what would win in a fight.\" So Panthers vs rams? Panther, duh. Sometimes it was trickier, like ravens vs colts. In which case ravens are a pretty cool bird, so ravens.    \n\nMy uncle's and my dad's friends were largely *not* amassed my system beat their actual thoughtful efforts. My dad rode high on trolling them, before it was known as trolling.",

You decide to short sell some stock, so you borrow 5 from Person A and sell 5 to Person B. You've shorted 5 stocks, Person A is owed 5, and Person B owns 10. Now you decided to short sell some more stock, so you borrow 10 from Person B and sell 10 to Person C. Now the situation is as follows:  \n  \n - Person A is owed 5 stocks  \n  \n - Person B is owed 10 stocks  \n  \n - Person C owns 10 stocks  \n  \nYou've now shorted 15 stocks, even though there are only 10 stocks to go around. Eventually, Person A and Person B need their stocks back, and since Person C owns them, they can demand any price they want (this is the short squeeze). WSB is trying to be Person C,",

This has heavily contributed to the huge increasing wealth disparity between the top 1% and the rest of us. \n\nSince government actions are the primary reason for the increase in wealth of these millionaires and billionaires, it is only reasonable that increasing taxes (especially capital gain taxes) on this group and redistributing this new revenue to the rest of us including those at the bottom of the economic ladder seems fair.",

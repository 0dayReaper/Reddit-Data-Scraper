This was for John Lewis and this was personal.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying Lewis or the insults necessarily made Trump lose here, I'm saying this is a fitting memorial for Lewis and the insults from Trump make it even sweeter. That being said those things definitely did not help his cause lol. As many have pointed out Stacey Abrams deserves so much credit for her energy and enthusiasm  in the work she has done mobilizing voters.\n\nStay energized for January and the runoffs.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/repjohnlewis/status/758023941998776321\n\nEdit 2: for those who want proof of Trump insulting Atlanta and Lewis:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/moq5o1C5uRw\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-trump-insults-atlanta-20180107-story.html%3foutputType=amp",

Please remember that decency, hospitality, and appropriate manners are still important in the south. My relatively conversative, black, combat veteran friend has shared with me how this presidency has made him and his family feel - it is shameful, unAmerican, and can not be stood for.  Thank God for democracy and thank you fellow Georgians for not making us complicit in maniacal tyranny. Being decent is not who you vote for, but rather how you treat those that vote differently.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you very much for all of the kind words and awards.  I merely voiced what hundreds of thousands of decent Georgians felt as they quietly did their civic duties, politics be damned. Everything that is wrong with America can always be fixed by everything that is right with America.",

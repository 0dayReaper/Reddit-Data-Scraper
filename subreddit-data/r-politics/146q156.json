McConnell created this problem for his party by not voting to remove trump from office when he absolutely should have. Our nation is less safe because McConnell and the entire gop got in bed with this idiot in the first place",

If the trial process extends into the election, he will see getting elected as a means to avoid prison. Then the GOP gets fractured due to this split and they lose 2024. Then Trump gets found guilty and gets sent to Federal Prison and we all high-five each other and have ice cream.",

My wild-ass-guess is that the GOP base will start to lose enough interest in Trump that it\u2019s clear he won\u2019t win the primary. What Trump will do is dangle his MAGA base at whoever will promise him a pardon. Unfortunately that\u2019s most of the remaining candidates.\n\nHopefully there\u2019s enough independents that will vote democrat to stop anyone from pardoning the Cheeto.",

Dicta is a commet, suggestion, or observation made by the court that's not necessary for the case at hand. It's not legally binding on other courts.\n\nAs recent as 2021, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in [Lorance v. Commandant ](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/20-3055/20-3055-2021-09-23.html) that acceptance wasn't admitting guilt:\n\n&gt; We conclude that Lorance\u2019s acceptance of the pardon did not have the legal effect of a confession of guilt and did not constitute a waiver of his habeas rights.\n\nPage 10 of the ruling goes into details why the Court rejects the idea from Burdick that continues the belief that accepting a pardon is admitting guilt.",

I haven\u2019t seen a poll since the news broke, but the last indictment didn\u2019t change anything among his diehards, I can\u2019t imagine this one will either.  They believe he\u2019s being unfairly persecuted, this will just reinforce that.  Two more incoming indictmenrs will really prove to them that the entire deep state is after their guy.  They\u2019ll never admit that it\u2019s because he\u2019s a raging criminal leaving a trail of evidence in his wake.  Republican primary voters are the true hardliners.  I don\u2019t see them budging much. \n\nThe only good scenario here is that somehow this all goes down quickly and he\u2019s convicted.  \n\nIf he somehow becomes president and this isn\u2019t over, he\u2019ll just force his new DOJ to drop everything.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll grow because rational GOP voters can\u2019t ignore the quality of this case plus there\u2019s more real cases coming (Georgia and Jan 6th). I also think those same GOP voters will see Trump as a likely loser in the general election against Biden because independents and some republicans will vote against Trump. Pragmatism takes over at some point - you need a candidate that can win and that won\u2019t be Trump because the swing voters won\u2019t join the GOP in that effort.\n\nGotta Dream!",

Just look at cruz making fund raising calls for trump after he absolutely insulted him in a very personal manner. Cruz even made a half ass plead to \u201cvote you conscience\u201d at the convention but every single one of them kissed trumps ring in the end and they all turned on their former party leaders. \n\nThe party is absolutely uncanny in that ability. A hive mind that takes orders from Fox News and forgets any and all things contradictory from the past. \n\nBut\u2026\u2026\n\nTrump is different, and he has inspired and cultivated a sector of the party that had embraced all the more radical views including an absolute refusal to compromise in any way and totally fierce loyalty to what trump represents, and trump will not pass or let go of that mantle  excuse it\u2019s his only chance of survival. \n\nI think ultimately 15 or 20 percent of that base will eventually peel off and unite behind another candidate. \n\nThat remaining 10-15 percent is enough to sink their party chances though. \n\nUnless of course RFK Jr or Manchin manage to siphon off enough Dems.",

Adding ways to disqualify people from running for president is pretty dangerous, since we should expect it to be adversely used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the question is: which is worse - letting our justice system disqualify candidates for president (and trusting that the justice is legitimate), or letting someone run for president even after a conviction (and trusting the populace to judge the legitimacy and relevance of said conviction). Neither of these are great options, but I wouldn't say that going with the latter is clearly wrong, to the point of being considered an oversight or a mistake.",

Remeber, Texas is a massive and diverse state, there are people you agree with,  disagree with,  and people who don't give a damn about politics.  In this moment,  there are people suffering and battling for their lives.  Food, water,  &amp; fuel are running out.  This is not a good situation.",

So with money in mind, it turns out a lot of companies didn't bother with winterizing the equipment properly across all sectors of energy in the state. Its been said if in fact Texas was subject to the rules and regulations the rest of the US is, the situation would not be nearly as severe. It makes it all the more insulting that their state politicians aren't doing anything to help when a good chunk of them more than likely received campaign funds from people in the energy sector who made that money cutting corners and putting people in this situation.",

There is no compromise here. There is zero risk. She's basically just doing what's she preaches. Crazy enough , her current base would probably be upset if she did nothing. \n\nNow when I am looking for a politician to support I am going to be looking for politicians like AOC. A politician who's base basically demands to look after those in need.",

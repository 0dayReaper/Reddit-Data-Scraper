Is your response to people challenging your support to point out that Republicans are worse? If yes to all these, you may be reacting in a cultish way to democrats.\n\nBut if you're supporting democrats because they are fighting for the same things you're fighting for and your support is for the agenda, not the person or the \"D\" by their name, then you're a normal voter who has just unfortunately realized that one party (GOP) has abdicated their service to the country in an attempt to keep power at all cost, even when that cost is the democracy of the country. I voted straight blue because I realized this. It would be nice if there were other voices, sane voices, more progressive voices in the political arena, but we're not there yet.\n\nIt's my hope that more and more AOC type progressives get elected at state and local levels and split from the democrat party. Then democrats become the \"conservative\" party of the country. and the wacko GOP dissolves in acid as it deserves to.",

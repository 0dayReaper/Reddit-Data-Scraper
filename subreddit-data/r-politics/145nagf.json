The orange shitstain is a product of parents who told him he was the greatest, the best, the smartest and brightest. Then Fred used all of his power and wealth to make it so, and to smooth the path, no matter what was in little Donnie's way, or how bad he continually fucked up. \n\nFred repeatedly bought a spot for Donny at distinguished educational institutions where the boy did not belong. Fred asked a podiatrist, a tenant of his, to get Donny out of being drafted for Vietnam. Thus, the fake \"bone spurs\" diagnosis. As a reward, Fred gutted and renovated the doctor's offices at no charge and never charged him another dime for rent for several decades until the doctor retired. Fred bought three million dollars in casino chips, as one of Donnie's Casinos was hours away from failing, literally saving the place. It didn't help in the end, as Donald tried and failed multiple times to build and or operate successful casinos in Atlantic City. Eventually, having destroyed four of them. He grifted hundreds of millions from investors, and stole tens of millions or more from contractors, suppliers, vendors, lawyers, architects, engineers and others that he just stiffed when it came time to pay up. In the end, the gambling commission told him to find a new place to grift, and GTFO of NJ. \n\n In an insanely detailed and rigorously verified investigation, the NY Times carefully documented that Donald,  over the course of his lifetime, received over 400 million dollars worth of Fred's wealth. Fred did so many illegal, immoral, and fucked up things to keep his boy Donny above the water line. For Fred it was a lifetime of assuring that Donny failed upward, every time, it's both sad and funny. Donald, being the psychopath he is, could never admit any of this, and believes that his lifetime of fuckups, are in fact nothing but wins, and he is a \"self-made multi-billionaire\"  His origin story is an absurd, easily disprovable lie about \"borrowing a million dollars from daddy, and immediately paying it back,  to start DJT's global, and wildly successful empire\". \n\n It's like being four years old and getting to walk on a MLB field between games. Dad walks over, drops a ball in your little glove, and tells you that you are a star. You then spend a lifetime talking about your famous career as a MLB star player.",

He also plays the idiot when committing crimes himself.\n\n&gt;\u201cWhy can\u2019t you find me 11,000 votes?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see why it would be Russia who attacked the election\u201d. \u201cI have total declassification power and I can declassify even by thinking about it\u201d. \u201cName one of these groups. Proud Boys? Ok, Proud Boys stand back, and stand by.\u201d [**\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we just told them we don\u2019t have anything here?\u201d**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/10/politics/takeaways-trump-nauta-indictment/index.html)\n\n* He assiduously avoids leaving a paper trail that could tie him to his crimes - he doesn\u2019t email or text - while amassing blackmail (tapes and receipts) on all of the people around him to keep them in line and throw them under the bus when he needs to save his own skin.\n\n&gt;\u201cJames Comey better hope there aren\u2019t any tapes!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask my lawyer Michael Cohen about Stormy Daniels because I never met her\u201d \u201cMy staff packed the boxes. I never saw any documents.\u201d\n\nWhy is he only finally being criminally charged now, after 60+ years of rampant criminality? \n\nBecause **after more than 5 years** of the smartest and most seasoned investigators and prosecutors at the DoJ scouring for evidence, tapping phones, and trying to flip Trump\u2019s minions and co-conspirators (including successfully flipping Trump\u2019s mob lawyer Michael Cohen), they finally **finally** got their hands on one tape recording of Trump slipping up and revealing his intent in committing a crime so serious that he won\u2019t be able to pay his way out of it.",

Therefore it is the military that wants to attack Iran and not me.\"\n\nThe document that he's waiving around is part of a massive library of documents that is constantly being updated by military planners.  In that library there are plans to attack (and defend from) every country at multiple different scales from minor raids to full-scale regime change.  It isn't outside the possibility that there are military plans to attack the UK or France.\n\nThese documents are not there because the military is preparing to attack every country.  They exist so that if the elected civilian leadership wants to employ the military to attack a target, then the military is already ready with a plan.  \n\nThe entire goal of the military is basically \"be ready\".  Be ready for attack, be ready for defense, be ready for special operations.  These documents are part of that readiness.\n\nTrump is so massively ignorant in many ways, but the argument he is trying to make really demonstrates that his ignorance is a real thing and not a show he puts in for his base.",

That all worked, mostly, for him in the past. The problem he ran into is that the US government is not going to back down, and instead, is going to tack on charges, instead of slinking away from the intimidation. Trump finally got into a situation he couldn\u2019t handle the way he\u2019s always done, and those instincts were so ingrained that he\u2019s been just digging a bigger hole. Let us just hope and pray that the remaining judges and other government appointees see the writing on the wall and that instability in government is bad for our precious capitalism. And let us just take a moment to reflect upon how close we were to having emporer trump, was it not for a few very brave USSS officers and police officers, especially Eugene Goodman.",

He seems much more intelligent than the individuals I work with who have 70 and below IQs, which is the upper limit of intellectually disabled. People seem to underestimate how dumb average can be.\n\nEdit: his lack of political/legal knowledge, ignorance, arrogance, lack of foresight, narcissism, and history of getting away with crimes causes him to do incredibly dumb shit.

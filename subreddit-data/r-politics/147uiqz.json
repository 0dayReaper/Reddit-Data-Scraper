This is how they interact with their base, who will just repeat what they hear and never check for themselves. \"Well, I heard there was not even an allegation he showed it to anybody\" expect to hear this from the rubes. They lie to the public, the public repeats their lies, then they claim public support for their lies. A disgusting feedback loop, made possible by the likes of Fox News.",

Hell, Democrats even gave them a gift in the form of his second impeachment where they could have said \"Inciting an insurrection is a bridge too far, even for this menagerie of invertebrates, and we're going to let a handful of Senators vote to remove him and prevent him from running again.\"\n\nSince then, they've had four years to dump this guy. They could have gone on the attack after 2022 and said \"Trump is the reason we don't control the Senate, why our House caucus is an ungovernable nightmare hellscape of absolute whackjobs, and why we lost the White House in 2020. He's a loser, through and through, and we won't let him keep losing.\"\n\nInstead, anyone that remotely criticizes Trump is run out of the party. Even now, when he's been indicted on national security and espionage charges, they're still rallying around him.\n\nNot one of these clowns is fit to hold office, and every one of them has broken their oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign or domestic.",

Trump vehemently denies any wrongdoing in connection with the case. \n\nIn an interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and author of the new book \"Decades of Decadence: How Our Spoiled Elites Blew America's Inheritance of Liberty, Security, and Prosperity,\" expressed concern about the impact of the indictment on the country \u2014 and said it is \"political in nature.\"\n\n\"When you bring an indictment like this, it's not done in isolation. It's not done in a vacuum. You gotta take a lot of things into account. There's no allegation that there was harm done to the, to the national security. There's no allegation that he sold it to a foreign power or that it was trafficked to somebody else or that anybody got access to it,\" said Rubio. \n\n\"You have to weigh the harm of that, or lack thereof, on the harm that this indictment does to the country. This is deeply divisive,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sen-marco-rubio-trump-federal-indictment/",

That is why she cannot be regarded as lying; for she does not presume that she knows the truth, and therefore she cannot be deliberately promulgating a proposition that she presumes to be false: Her statement is grounded neither in a belief that it is true nor, as a lie must be, in a belief that it is not true.

                                    "comment": "\"On Bullshit\" is one of the most profound papers I've ever read.  It's not saying much, because I hardly ever read philosophy and I'm not a philosopher, but still, it was useful.\n\nI knew about the important distinction between people who are intentionally and knowingly telling a falsehood (lying) versus people who unintentionally say something false.  People say false things for plenty of reasons, some innocent, some malicious.  That fact is why I try not to jump to the conclusion that they are lying when I perceive something wrong, because innocent mistakes are common.  Very common (hence Hanlon's Law).\n\nIt never occurred to me that there are some people out there who simply *don't care* what the truth is -- i.e. what Frankfurt distinguishes as \"bullshit\" and persons that are \"bullshitters\" -- rather than mere liars.  Liars still care about the truth because they're knowingly stating the opposite of truth.  Bullshitters don't care what the truth is.\n\nAs someone who cares about and tries to get things correct, for me to digest the idea some people don't even try to figure out the truth, and ONLY want to persuade people they are right regardless of any evidence to the contrary, it was a real revelation.  How do these people operate?  What a bizarre existence.  What an insult to trying to understand the world through a shared experience, even though it's a difficult process to reach a consensus.  It's like these guys cynically decided \"Why even try?\"\n\nFor me, it put the \"Trump era\" and \"alternative facts\" in a proper context.  How can these people say contradictory things even in successive sentences and not have their head metaphorically explode?  Because they aren't keeping track of the truth.  Their only point is to fleece their flocks.  Lie or truth?  Doesn't matter.  Whichever is more persuasive and more self-serving is the only part of the evaluation.\n\nFor a bullshitter, uncomfortable and awkward truths never have to be faced.  This is why the insecure and egotistical are so addictively drawn to bullshit: they never have to face the awkwardness that normal people have to face when caring about and accepting the truth when discovering they are wrong.  Some people want to hear bullshit that confirms what they \"already know\".  Nothing else.  They are completely different from the people who are willing to look at the evidence and say \"Well, damn, I guess I was wrong.\"\n\nFrankfurt's initial essay is from years ago (the paper was 1986), but wow was it timely to learn about it.\n\n[Edit: People who are bullshitters would read the story of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" and then say \"Why did the kid point out that the Emperor was naked?  What a jerk.  Those tailors had a good racket going.\"  They'd probably also suggest the kid should be jailed for pointing out the truth.]",

He can still talk fast but his mind moves like a freight liner. Slow and with tremendous momentum. He can spit out paragraphs in the time it takes his mind to move through a single point. Essentially saying the same thing a dozen different ways before moving on. Once he does move on he's going to his next point regardless of anyone else in the conversation. It's impossible to move him to another point or turn the conversation from whatever direction he's already going in.\n\nI'm just lucky my grandpa was a history teacher and hobby gardener. If he was a fraudster his speech would be identical to trump's in both pattern and content.",

He definitely displays a lot of the characteristics of a bullshit artist, although I do think there is a meaningful distinction to be made between what we normally think of as a bullshit artist and someone like Trump.\n\nI'm definitely splitting hairs, but I think of a bullshit artist as someone whose disregard for reality is active and conscious - i.e. \"I know that a thing called 'reality' exists and am making the conscious choice to not care about it for purposes of saying what I want to say.\"\n\nA narcissist, I think, is less conscious of the process, because to them it's not so much that they're disengaged with reality and more that their internal defense mechanisms create for them a completely alternate reality. The rules for Trump's alternate reality appear to be very simple: \"I am always perfect, any information that suggests otherwise is a lie, and anyone who spreads any such information is my enemy and must be destroyed.\"\n\nSo I think of him as less of a \"bullshit artist\" and more of a \"bullshit addict.\" The end result is still bullshit, but what's going on behind the scenes is pretty different.",

For people that know nothing about the topics he's speaking on, it comes off as advanced / smart / genius.  For people that have even a basic understanding of the topics, it just sounds like Musk is making basic top level statements about his companies' current or future products.  Something nearly all CEOs of all companies are able to do, unless they're just terrible CEOs.\n\nHe'll even throw statements in like \"it's way harder than you'd think\", or \"this little thing's importance is way more profound than you'd think\".  As if his companies and engineers are the only ones capable of it.  If the auto industry's move towards electrification is any indication... any engineers can do the same things when they're given time to do it.",

Literally none of that has been shown at all. Instead, what\u2019s been shown is that Twitter had a competent trust &amp; safety team that debated tough questions around how to apply policies for users on their platform and did not seem at all politically motivated in their decisions. Furthermore, while various government entities sometimes did communicate with the company, there\u2019s little evidence of any attempt by government officials to compel Twitter to moderate in any particular way, and Twitter staff regularly and repeatedly rebuffed any attempt by government officials to go after certain users or content.\n\nThis was such a stupid flop of a conspiracy attempt. Matt Taibbi, who orchestrated much of this nonsense, was called out on TV interviews on his errors and left Twitter the next day.\n\nBut the damage is already done. Musk got his far-right conspiracy content. Likely no one who cared about this followed up or looked into the details whatsoever. And conservatives are onto their next misguided controversy of the week.",

Their base absolutely believes that Twitter was going after people based solely on political affiliation and worked with the government to silence them.\n\nJust because the basis was stupid and had a ton of evidence against it doesn't mean the attempt was unsuccessful. The point wasn't to sue the US government. The point was to spread misinformation to erode trust in the federal government. \n\nThe goal is to dismantle or neuter the fed to ensure that the states that want to can violate laws such as the civil rights act, federal labor laws, environment protection laws, and safety laws with impunity. Eroding the average idiot's trust in having a federal government furthers their goals, whether or not the criticism is backed by factual events.",

Twitter can ban whoever they want. It should be a big deal that the US government was providing information like this with any kind of intent to silence anyone.",

He did not, however, comment on the immunity deal.\n\nOverall, that doesn't entirely disprove the possibility of Meadows being fully cooperative. But it's less of a useful data point than I would have initially hoped.",

Based on their experience the events of this week confirm that an indictment of Trump is indeed imminent. \n\nBtw, one of them, a Karen Friedman-(something), who previously worked for the Manhattan DA office for 20 years correctly predicted than an indictment in the hush money case was possible before the weekend when everyone on the left raged that the grand jury was due for a 2 week break\u2026despite rumors that a coming indictment was possible. Most people didn\u2019t see that coming. These guys know what they\u2019re talking about.",

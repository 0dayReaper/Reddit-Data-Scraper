This, Santos says, could force him into pre-trial detention or impose upon him onerous release conditions.\u00a0\n\nIt looks like he would rather not go to jail, but he knows that the people who helped him post the bond would not want to be known, thus why he is asking for the appeal. Personally, I think he shat his bed and I think the judge should tell him to lie in it.\n\nPosting a $500,000 bond could be considered a thing of value and that could come off badly for the three people involved, especially if there is a conflict of interest due to his position in the house of representatives.\n\nI am really enjoying watching the Republican party implode because of their lack of morals and their insistence on creating the most adversarial kayfabr political drama to protect them themselves from oversight, justice, and law and order. It's funny, because I have heard them use law and order as a dog whistle for so long.",

George Santos, Republican of New York, filed an 8-page appeal Friday seeking to keep sealed the names of those who helped him make the $500,000 bond in his federal criminal fraud case.\n\nSubmitting the filing just before the noon deadline, Santos' lawyers argue that the people who helped him post the bond would likely have to withdraw from serving as his bond supporters if their names are released. This, Santos says, could force him into pre-trial detention or impose upon him onerous release conditions. \n\nThe court filing includes a passage stating that Santos \"has essentially publicly revealed that the suretors are family members and not lobbyists, donors or others seeking to exert influence over the Defendant.\"\n\nSantos's next court appearance is scheduled for June 30, but the judge could rule on whether to release the unsealed records at any time.\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-santos-appeal-keep-names-500000-bond-sealed/",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Washington - Rep. George Santos, Republican of New York, filed an 8-page appeal Friday seeking to keep sealed the names of those who helped him make the $500,000 bond in his federal criminal fraud case.\n\n&gt; Submitting the filing just before the noon deadline, Santos&amp;#039; lawyers argue that the people who helped him post the bond would likely have to withdraw from serving as his bond supporters if their names are released.\n\n&gt; The federal judge in New York granted a request from media organizations to make public the identities of three people who signed the bond for Santos&amp;#039; release after his indictment, but said their names should remain hidden for now to allow him to appeal.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/14583ig/george_santos_files_appeal_to_keep_names_of_those/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688350 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Santos**^#1 **bond**^#2 **count**^#3 **filed**^#4 **helped**^#5",

There should be no such \u201cprotections\u201d for somebody who posts bond, they don\u2019t require anonymity or anything of the sort. There\u2019s literally no point to it besides hiding who one\u2019s benefactor(s) are &amp; the government knows this. And of course they play along, because if they get caught for whatever crimes they\u2019ve committed while in office, they wouldn\u2019t want the public to know their special interests groups or some billionaire they pander to bailed them outta jail. It\u2019s the same reason most politicians never get prosecuted for a crime that literally ANY other regular person would get a long prison term for, like fraud or insider trading. Both sides have a tentative agreement to protect each other.",

Something more &amp; more Reps are trying.\n\n&gt; Submitting the filing just before the noon deadline, Santos' lawyers argue that the people who helped him post the bond would likely have to withdraw from serving as his bond supporters if their names are released. This, Santos says, could force him into pre-trial detention or impose upon him onerous release conditions. \n\nDidn't Santos say he would rather go to jail than release the names?  If the former, he should be warned not to drop the soap.",

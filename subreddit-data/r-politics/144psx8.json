It's the same map as 2020 more or less, not counting the odd special election.\n\nRepublicans: \n\nDan Sullivan of Alaska comes up in 2026, which might be interesting with RCV. I'm not counting on it but they sent a Democrat to the House last year and that's also a statewide race because they only have one district.\n\nOl' Moscow Mitch is up again too. He's the sort who might decide to just die in office, but if he decides not to run and young voters are charged up that *might* be competitive - not that I'd get your hopes up.\n\nSusan Collins in Maine comes up. Haven't heard too much about her recently, so maybe between now and then she can avoid getting humiliated by her caucus or saying anything so dumb you wonder how she manages to get both legs in her pants in the morning. Otherwise there might be some kind of pathway to a D pickup.\n\nSteve Daines in Montana won in a blowout in 2020 (10 points over a popular former governor) but could potentially be a pickup, especially if a GOP candidate beats Jon Tester in 2024. Montana has an old trend of sending Democrats to Washington, so it's not unthinkable.\n\nThom Tillis in North Carolina beat a strong opponent in 2020, at least in part because said opponent admitted to an affair not long before the election. In the end Tillis won by under 2 points after trailing in polls all year, including on election day. Seems flippable with the right candidate.\n\nDemocrats:\n\nJohn Hickenlooper in Colorado is up for election, but he'll be 74. If he decides not to run, there's a small chance that a red wave year (god forbid) gets a Republican pick up.\n\nJon Ossoff in Georgia is likely to be a more vulnerable seat.\n\nGary Peters of Michigan very narrowly won in 2020. MI's been trending blue but the margins mean it might be a risky race.\n\nBiggest challenge is it's a midterm election. With a decent performance like we saw last year, Dems could probably flips at least one of those seats without losing anything. Might get them back to parity or a mild lead in the senate if 2024 favors them.",

So even if he is on the ballot for the GOP he's likely going to be running from jail.\n\nWe could very well end up in a situation where Trump runs as a third-party candidate which he has already threatened to do from jail.",

You treat 2024 like a pre-2016 election. Well that's not where we are anymore. Politics is not the same. It's a rough map for Ds, but it's a rough landscape for Rs, who keep doing wildly unpopular shit. Voters also turned out less in 2022 than 2020, which is typical of a midterm year. If the 8M more Ds than Rs hadn't sat out, we'd still have the House and we'd have replaced Ron Johnson with Mandela Barnes. Those voters typically show up for presidential years, though. We have a shot.\n\nIf all you have to say is negativity that could dissuade others from voting, you should really consider saying nothing at all!\n\ne: typo on Manchin majority",

We can try a constitutional amendment or states can join the Compact but that's all we have.\n\nHowever, with the House and what is able to be 50 Senate seats with Sinema replaced and Manchin booted (or if he stays, it'll prob be 51), we can reform or kill the filibuster, *expand the Court to 13*, then pass judicial ethics, pass a new Voting Rights Act, admit DC and PR as states, etc. This slew of changes opens the door to so much more. Without a wild Court majority, we can trust they'll rule with the law and not with their evil little hearts. With DC and PR as states, we welcome democracy. DC is likely to be blue as well and PR purple.\n\nOne significant change we can make - that only requires a slim majority - that will really ensure Rs are forced to adapt to the times is uncapping the US House. 435 just doesn't make sense. Make the smallest district equal to 1/3 of a Wyoming, also meaning Wyoming as a minimum has 3 House Reps, and use that as a baseline for every state. We end up with over 1600 reps - reps more accountable to their voters as they represent fewer people. In addition, this has the effect of slightly fixing the Electoral College as the number of House seats contributes to the number of EVs. While I've done the math and it's still not perfectly proportional value in the EC because of the flat +2 from the Senate, it gets much closer and makes it much harder to win the presidency off of just flyover patches of land.\n\nAfter this, we can focus on what matters day-to-day: ending the debt ceiling, M4A, wider student loan debt relief, regulating Big Pharma, federal guarantee to abortion (which may get challenged because of Dobbs, thus the new more representative SCOTUS would essentially bring back Roe), federal drug legalization, federal $20+ minimum wage, price gouging controls and punishments for businesses that saw record profits that caused inflation, etc. With the previous changes, we would actually have the votes and probably the consistent mandate to do it.",

There's no way to tell if you're cracking or packing to help, or hurt black voters.\n\nAlabama was accused of \"packing\" all the black voters into District 7, and \"cracking\" resulting in Districts 1, 2, and 3 that were solidly Republican.\n\nSo what will Alabama do? It could theoretically draw lines that have 0 districts that have a black majority - black people only make up 27% of the state, but they are located in the [\"black belt\"](http://alabamamaps.ua.edu/contemporarymaps/alabama/demographics/Percent%20black%202010.jpg), former plantations situated on fertile soil, across the state. \n\nThere are probably orders of magnitude way more ways to divide the state that results in 1 district capable of electing a black person than there are ways to divide it to result in 2 districts capable of electing a black candidate. You have to *want* to create two districts - but SCOTUS didn't say that 2 districts *had* to be created, just that the current map had the impact of a racial gerrymander.",

If post-retirement crimes were in play, there is one retired Army LtGen that comes to mind who should be first in the queue for UCMJ violations. \n\nThe reason CRS attorneys are writing opinions - and that\u2019s what is cited, an opinion - is because of the 2022 case of a Reservist (US vs Larrabee) whose case was re-reversed on appeal by the DC circuit, 2-1. This is a departure from decades of precedence and opens who knows how many military retirees - civilians - up to exposure under a \u201cuniform\u201d code that should no longer apply to them. I am disappointed the USSC did not take up the case. By NO MEANS do I think the accused should go free; his case should have been tried in Japanese court. \n\nAnother perspective:\n\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/dc-circuit-finds-court-martial-of-military-retirees-constitutional/",

Also worth noting that all of these charges have no minimum, so it's possible they could both never serve time, even if convicted.",

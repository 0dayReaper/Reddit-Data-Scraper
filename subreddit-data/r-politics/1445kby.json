There's an idea floating around in right wing circles lately about a correlation between autism and trans/nonbinary identities (where autistic people are more likely to identify that way than others). This appears to be true, BUT right-wingers are using this information to claim that the \"trans agenda\" is brainwashing autistic people to believe they are trans (through love and acceptance I guess). He's not saying that he wants to sterilize autistic people, he's claiming that progressives want to sterilize autistic people, and are using the trans agenda to do it.\n\nI hope I've been clear enough that I thoroughly disagree and am disgusted by this garbage, but that's *probably* what this meme is supposed to mean. Really he should have used the Spider-Man glasses template, but that's none of my business.",

When it was sold, as large shareholder still, he netted about $22 million\n\nX.com Bank (really stupid name for Bank as sounds like a porn site)  was  not   sucessful but was cash rich due to Musks and other investors money, Confinity , viewed as the main competion in the market, was sucessful but needed a cash injection to improve their paypal platform, thus they merged with X.com bank with Musk as CEO, under the name X.com\n\nAnd then he was quicky removed (while he was on holiday, trapped  half way around the world waiting for commercial flight back, which is why he does not like to take holidays anymore and uses private jets to get around, he is afraid of it happening again) as he was proving impossible to work with (simerlar storys from zip2) and because he had the bright idea of hosting paypal on Windows (which then would have been Windows NT, ask any techie who was around during that period if that was a good idea and you will only get one answer, NO)\n\nAfter he was removed as CEO, X.com was renamed Paypal (yes it means he was technically never CEO of Paypal)\n and all its focus went into the paypal platform (little bit of credit here,Musk seemed to want that as well, he had lost all interest in X.com's online banking operations), but because of shares (circa 11%)  he obtained from merger, when PayPal sold to Ebay he made $175 million\n\nHe then bought into Tesla motors for about $6 million and spent the next 17 years doing funding round after funding round (37 times to the tune of around $20 billion) until the company finally started to make a profit. With a few side gigs like spaceX, starlink, boring company, which to  date we don't know if any truly profitable and if so by how much\n\nIn short, Musk has failed upwards most of his life and if he has any special abilities  its mainly getting people to give him investment money and never selling shares until has no choice (i used to add PR to that skill list but since he fired Tesla PR team his public image has consistantly deteriorated, so his PR skills were more likely them not him)",

Millennials and gen-z aren\u2019t any worse at turning up to vote than any generation before them. In 1972 when the voting age was lowered less than 20% of the 18-24 yr olds showed up.\n\nThe biggest predictor of whether someone will vote or not is a history of voting. Its habit. To get  most young people to the polls you gotta push them there, they\u2019re generally apathetic and dont trust theyll be represented because to them a 45y/o politician is a lifetime older than them, beyond that its all out of touch geriatrics.",

Malls will thrive again because you can walk around indoors without melting your face off. \n\nHumans are very resilient and can thrive in any environment if given the proper equipment.

Zoomers, on the other hand, are the opposite.\n\nOne of my boomer relatives got one snail email from her old high school friends saying that Obama was secretly a member of Al Qaeda and that was that, couldn\u2019t ever convince her otherwise to this day.    Another boomer I know showed up  to work one day genuinely furious that \u201cthe democrats are going to ban air travel!  They\u2019re going to force us to carpool long distance with strangers when we go on vacation!\u201d   Last week I was in a diner I overheard the boomers at the table next to me consoling one of them whose grandson was murdered in a drug deal gone bad.   They all agreed that he never would have joined that motorcycle gang if it hadn\u2019t been for those darned democrats (didn\u2019t really explain how but apparently democrats are responsible for motorcycle gangs now).   None of these things make any sense.  \n\nThis newer younger generation is very smart, information savvy, and very at-risk of a diminished quality of life as a result of GOP policies.   The propaganda just isn\u2019t working on them nearly as well.",

Once people become homeowners expenses skyrocket.

Losing your house, or having it lose value, or having it become inhabitable (for your needs) is a very scary thought. So people start prioritizing keeping things the same. \n\nYou don't want construction near your house, you don't want manufacturing near your house, you don't want the schools to move, or traffic to increase. \n\nYou want things to stay the same, because right now is comfortable and change carries the small risk that you could lose your home. And while the chance is small, the prospect is terrifying. \n\n\nPeople tend to become conservative because they promise to lower taxes and keep things the same.\n\nMillennials can't afford homes.

Those final months winding down my senior year were the best time of my life. Of all our lives. They were completely robbed of that. They didn't even get a proper graduation.\n\nI know plenty of people in that age demo and they unanimously blame Trump for how poorly he handled the pandemic around this time frame. Maybe it was an unstoppable force and had Trump taken it seriously, the result would have been the same. But history will remember him as saying \"the warm weather will make it go away\" \"only 10-15 people will get it\" \"we will be back open in time for a beautiful Easter\"\n\nThen-- they are straight up told their lives are less important than their guns. That it's too bad if they feel unsafe in their classrooms, that's your problem, not mine.\n\nThen they are told-- don't want to risk getting pregnant-- simple-- don't have sex. Easy for you to say Mr. fat ugly Republican who would get a heart attack from a whole 5 seconds of action, not that you'd ever find a women actually attracted enough to you to let them hit.\n\nThen-- think of all of us who lost grandparents during the pandemic. Wiped off the face of the earth as if they never existed. Died alone, miserable, choking to death in an empty quarantined hospital bed. Never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\nTheir entire platform is dedicated to whining about how Trump actually won the election in 2020. Not a single solution to the actually issues that are going to impact and shape OUR future. Instead they are fighting invisible ghosts of the past.",

He and his 6 brothers served in the Civil War, in fact my great-great-grandpa fought in 26 different battles, was wounded multiple times, and ended up a Captain.  I grew up hearing my grandma's stories, and *she* grew up hearing my great-great-grandpa's stories. So when you think about it, there was only one generation separating me from the Civil War. And in a way, there's no separation at all--my grandma was living those stories she grew up hearing from one of the men who was there, and those stories in turn were passed to me. She was a living breathing bridge between me and the Civil War. It made the CW almost feel like it happened in my lifetime in a way. Idk if that makes sense, but it lowkey blew my mind a bit when I thought about it.",

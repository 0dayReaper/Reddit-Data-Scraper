The problem is people compare the wrong numbers. People often use the scale in the comment you replied to to determine wealth of $100k to $1m to $1b. Really the scale should be $1k to $1m to $1b. Spending $10.00 for someone with $1,000 in their account (which is a massive percentage of Americans) is the percentile equivalent of $10,000 for someone with $1m and $10m for someone with $1b. What is simply lunch for most Americans is the equivalent of large down payment on a new car for a millionaire, or retirement for a billionaire.",

This description fits some of my family, and most millionaires are just high paid professionals who may own a part of their lawfirm or practice (so, a case where the workers own the means of production).  But the key is they still work for a living using their labor, and are therefore a part of the working class, and virtually all of their money is taxed like regular income at the highest tax level.\n\nConversely, billionaires are part of the ownership class and simply do not work.  Their money begets more money and they just buy up more and more of America's businesses and land.  Their profits are not taxed anywhere near the same level as millionaires, because most of the money is technically not 'income' per se, and so billionaires have all these extra tax loopholes they can use.\n\nIt's frustrating not all millionaires get that, and it's even more frustrating trying to convince everyone else that we need to tax millionaires and billionaires more, and having ordinary people reject that even though they would only benefit.

Even at .1% from a billionaire is far more than than what he\u2019d pay, and far more than him combined with a ton of other households contributions.\n\nHe\u2019s legit worried that when people say tax the wealthy, they refer to him when he only makes $100,000 and he\u2019s living VERY comfortable for where he\u2019s located. I legit can\u2019t get it through his brain that he would need to make 100x more to even be considered \u201cwealthy\u201d, and even then, he\u2019d still be bringing home and unreasonable amount of money for his lifestyle.\n\nWe could lower a majority of most peoples taxes and invest more into the country for services if we simply taxed the rich like we tax the other 99% of America. It\u2019s unreal how people can\u2019t fathom or understand how it works or the logistics of it all.",

I make somewhere around your friend, I am very much doing alright. I sometimes out of curiosity calculate how much a proposed tax increase would have on what I have to pay and it's always *at most* a couple hundred dollars a year (and usually way, way less than that). I literally would not even notice a difference.\n\nAnd even though I feel like I'm pretty well off and could easily pay more taxes without any impact on my lifestyle, I'm not even really close to the bracket that most tax increases target. I'd have to make double what I do now to even be in that conversation.",

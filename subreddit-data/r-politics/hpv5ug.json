To break through to even ONE kid and make a difference is a huge reward.  \n\nTeachers are fucking incredible, amazing people who should be exhaulted and protected by society; it's outrageous and despicable that we allow horrible people (fuck Betsy DeVos with a pitchfork) to shit on them and take advantage of them.

Concrete was still around but nowhere near as strong or durable as what the Romans made. It wasn't until the 18th century that British and French engineers were able to develop something comparable to Roman concrete",

It is one of the reasons a lot of their architecture has lasted so long. Their cement is also actually stronger than current techniques, but that is a whole other thing. \n\nWhen Rome fell into decline and eventual collapse, the techniques of making cement were largely lost. Some scrolls had the information, but cataloging and maintaining such knowledge kind-of fell apart, so for roughly 1000 years people just kind of did without until the information was recovered from transcribed manuscripts in the 1400s.",

Our opinion of the US has slowly been turning around, and has now reached its deepest low, as your president is actively trying to lose the bit of respect we still have for the power the US has left. \n\nIn my personal opinion, I think the US will have to accept (like Spain, the UK ... decades and centuries before them) that their time as the biggest player in the game is coming to an end, and that they will have to try to fit into a changed world.",

People that change their minds in basic get put in a \"leavers pool\", and they are usually there just as long, if not longer before they can leave, than the company they were part of to graduate.  They still get yelled at and pushed around, but now also have the privilege of being paraded around in front of the companies in their \"newbie uniform\", and made to do chores like cleaning the mess hall bathroom while in use, or following their former company around during exercises in order to sweep up the dirt.  Silly shit like that.\n\nWe had 6 leavers in my company of 80, all convinced that they would be going back home as wounded heroes, where cushy jobs would open up doors for them just because they were brave enough to go to basic in the first place.\n\nAs the years go by though, Im more and more convinced that our nation is just severely sick, and people are signing up for the military with hopes of a brighter future through servitude, because they have no real options otherwise.  Keep em dumb and poor, so they can enlist for basic  needs and free college.  Its a vicious cycle.",

Tobacco companies didn't just discredit doctors, they hired their own doctors to tell them and the people what Tobacco companies wanted. Oil and coal companies have similarly hired climate 'scientists' to assure everyone that climate change is ko big deal and to keep burning their products. \n\nI wonder where else this crops up? My first thought is in food science, like sugar industries making it out to seem like fat is the leading cause of obesity over sugar. Im sure if one were to look hard enough, they'd find similar stories in agriculture, military, political and social science, and probably a lot of others im not thinking of right now",

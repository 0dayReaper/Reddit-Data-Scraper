This is crunch time now and time to see where this country is heading in the wake of the most corrupt administration in the history of our country. \n\nNaturally, this shouldn't be up to JUST biden/kamala. IDEALLY this will fall on the non partisan DOJ, then swiftly followed up by a WHAT SHOULD BE reinvigorated congress with democratic control. If congress fails to hold hearings now that the DOJ isn't there to provide cover for people ignoring subpoenas and fixing for the president.... we might as well not have won this election. \n\nThese people have done very real and long term damage to the institutions they've been running. In a lot of cases, deaths. Its hard to get an idea of how much misery and pain is in the wings from the trump admin, we all know the courts are fucked. But the damage done to the EPA/DoE/USPS and dozens and dozens more. These people all need to be made an example of. If we pull an obama and \"turn the page\" on this admin, we are signaling to conservatives that what they've done is ok because nothing matters and they can get away with killing their fellow countrymen.",

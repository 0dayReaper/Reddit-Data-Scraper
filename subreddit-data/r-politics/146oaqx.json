There was no other purpose for Trump to want this stuff other than to make a profit selling them.     \n      \nLock Him Up!",

No one will be above the law.\" [source](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-classified-above-law/)\n\nLater, he  did this:\n\n&gt; Trump signed legislation that year that extended section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, part of which included a change to 18 U.S. Code \u00a71924, increasing the penalty for \"unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material\" from one to five years.\n\n&gt; According to Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute, this upgrades the offense from a misdemeanor to a Class E felony.\n\n&gt; Before the legislation was signed, Trump had repeatedly attacked 2016 presidential race rival Hillary Clinton over claims that she had mishandled classified information; she was never charged. [source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-indicted-classified-documents-felony-1805561)\n\nHe's now being charged under section 702,  (among others,) which he made a felony.

Does that mean Trump sold it to someone like Saudi Arabia? We don\u2019t really know What he\u2019s done with any of the documents; he easily could have copied them on a copy machine and sold them to multiple different parties.\n\nBut in my mind, the real danger, and the behavior that is even more indefensible, is the Republican reaction to this indictment. Biden appointed Garland to be the Attorney General. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that; every President appoints their own Attorney General, including Trump, who appointed Bill Barr. Garland elected to appoint a special counsel to investigate Trump; in fact, doing so is designed to guarantee that there is no political influence in the investigation.\n\nbut none of that matters to trump supporters. The fact that Trump betrayed his country doesn\u2019t matter to them. The fact that they are undermining our justice system doesn\u2019t matter to them. They would gladly sacrifice our entire form of government to their beloved god. His supporters, especially his elected supporters, need to be unambiguously condemned as traitors to the United States. Yes, it is their right to say anything and to support anyone they want. But it is our right to call them on it. Condemn them. Ostracize them. If they call for violence, arrest them. This is the most dangerous time for our country that I\u2019ve seen in my 70+ years. If there were reprehensible behavior isn\u2019t stopped now, the next time we elect an authoritarian may be the last. Thank God Trump is an incompetent buffoon.",

Her trial in the case of U.S. v. Holmes, et al. ended in January 2022 when Holmes was convicted of defrauding investors, and acquitted of defrauding patients. She was sentenced to serve 111\u20444 years in prison, beginning on May 30, 2023.\n\nIndictment, trial end +4 years, sentence start +1.5 years.\n\nTrump will never see a consequence, not his whole life",

Getting indicted on espionage charges is a consequence. It sets in motion a trajectory where more likely than not, he will see prison time. Now you can say it won't ever happen, and you'll be right, right up to the point when it does. Honestly, did you expect him to be indicted? And yet here we are. The fact this is happening in Florida actually means the judicial process may proceed quicker than it would elsewhere. This should be cheered because it is a significant step in the right direction.",

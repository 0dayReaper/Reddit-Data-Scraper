Now, if you had said neurodivergent children are more likely to be abused, those articles would be accurate.\n\nTo add regarding your edit: stating 'many child abuse victims are neurodivergent'  is extremely flawed logic considering the high rates of abuse seen and the concept of neurotypical.\n\n\nAlso, good job editing that third article in...

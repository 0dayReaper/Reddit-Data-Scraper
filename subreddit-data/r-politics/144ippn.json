Ron DeSantis, have been keeping at arm\u2019s length.\n\nPence, who kicked off his campaign Wednesday, has set himself apart from most of the GOP primary field by talking about entitlement reform, often called the third rail of American politics.\n\n\u201cThe biggest drivers of runaway spending are our New Deal and Great Society programs upon which Americans depend every day, Social Security and Medicare,\u201d Pence said in his presidential announcement speech.\n\nIf left unaddressed, the programs\u2019 burdens will \u201ccrush the future\u201d for the next generation, he argued.\n\nHis stance puts him directly at odds with former President Donald Trump, who has roundly rejected any cuts to the two programs and has whaled on DeSantis over his past support for restructuring proposals. Trump and President Joe Biden have both attacked DeSantis from the same angle.\n\nRead more: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/trump-desantis-fight-social-security-medicare.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/trump-desantis-fight-social-security-medicare.html)",

I and others were promised that we would get our money out when we retired. I earned my benefits and the GQP candidates who seek to screw me out of what I am owned should never be allowed to hold office. The GQP attempts to take away my earned benefits is theft pure and simple. Here are some solutions to the alleged SS \u201ccrisis\u201d: 1. Tax the churches; 2. Tax stock transactions; 3.  Make hedge founders pay normal income tax rates; 4. Cut the defense budget by 50%; 5.  Create a billionaire tax; If there is a crisis,  and that is BS, I just solved it",

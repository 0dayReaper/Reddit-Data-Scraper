We don't know 100% yet if that is what is happening, but we do know about a month ago a federal judge ordered that there was enough evidence that Trump had asked his attorneys to be co-conspiritors that attorney-client privledge no longer applied and several of them were ordered to testify before the grand jury. Two of his lawyers are unnamed but mentioned in the indictment.\n\nEdit: And it is entirely possible from their released statements that it is due to them being DC lawyers, and the case being tried in Florida. I personally don't believe this explination due to the speed at which they left, but changing to local attorneys based on the unexpected change in venue is certainly commonly done and thus a possible reason (and the one that the attorneys who quit implied in their statement).",

EO 13526 is the current national classification schema and would largely protect all four of them (basically, Trump and Pence would be covered via classification authority, Biden would be protected from any charges relating to documents from his VPship for the same, and HRC would be protected as long as any classified materials originated from the State department during her tenure under the EO). \n\nThey\u2019re going after Trump via 793(e) which relates to NDI materials (documents containing national defense information, regardless of classification) and his ownership and non-prompt return of them. \n\nBasically, under that statute, Trump would have been fine\u2026 IF he didn\u2019t try to delay returning the documents or \u2018hide\u2019 any of them. \n\n(Tl;dr - classification is irrelevant and the same argument that protects Trump there also protects Biden (post-2009), HRC (SOS docs), and Pence. This is about NDI mats, and specifically that Trump tried to not turn them over when called out for having them.)",

So let's paint a picture.\n\nFor this exercise we must assume that the documents (and money) are part of the goal, but not the primary objective. After all, the juiciest secrets are long gone and paid for with the gold of our enemies and the blood of our assets. It therefore doesn't make sense that Trump wouldn't cooperate past a certain point. Nor does it make sense for him to so publicly flaunt the stolen documents the way he has.\n\nBut if we zoom out we'll see how utterly discrediting this is to the US on the world stage. It wasn't just OUR secrets Trump stole, after all. It was the secrets of our allies as well. The ramifications on the trustworthiness of the U.S. as an ally or partner are REALLY bad. Why would anyone ever work with or trust us again when some 2-bit conman can just dead-ass walk out of the White House with an entire plane full of our most delicate intelligence - and then retain it for more than a year and a half while the Feds hem and haw over the most politically palatable way to approach a national security crisis?\n\nIf we assume that the REAL goal was to paint the U.S. as a dangerously unstable and weak ally, to permanently alter the perceptions of those who would consider working with us in the future, it suddenly all makes sense. Suddenly Trump thumbing his nose at the Feds every time they requested the documents back makes sense. Suddenly there is a valid strategic reason for Trump et al to be so blatant and obvious about their Mar-a-Lago paper parade. \n\nIn other words, this has Putin's fingerprints all over it. He is essentially taunting the entire Western world over its powerlessness to respond to this breach.",

This is what he did. This is his legacy amongst many other of the most backwards and hateful acts. What a regression.\n\nRepublicans and right wingers. You were wrong about Trump and your worldview at the time of his election and during the presidency was flawed and incorrect. /r/the_donald and /r/conservative participants were wrong and their world views were incorrect.

Back when I was conservative, I worked on the Ross Perot campaign. That whole clusterfuck showed me just how bad an outsider can be, and looking at Trump it was instantly obvious to me that he was likely to be one of the bad ones, with less emotional stability and political acumen than Perot. And I say that from the perspective of purely his personality and volatility, not his politics. It was a dreadfully dumb idea to empower him.",

Maybe it's bullshit who knows but he took a startup and built it into a billion dollar company.  He didn't just seed it he was president during that entire time.  Before that he did work on farms and silos according to his profile.\n\nHis policies suck, his website is pretty unimpressive and he's hoping he can buy his way into the race and do better than expected in Iowa because of his background and proximity to the state.  My only point is if this guy was a democrat we wouldn't be criticizing his background in the same way.\n\nHe's a generic republican who's likely much better than the field and we should be happy when he fails because he would have a much better shot in a general than Desantis or Trump.",

His business background and ability to play in rural areas can then help him in New Hampshire.  And two unexpected, good finishes there would change your expectations of what he can do",

Then they fail in New Hampshire because that stuff doesn't play well there.  But since I think Burgum can do well in Iowa just based on his ability to speak with authority on rural, agricultural issues, I think he can then turn a good performance in Iowa into a good performance in New Hampshire, where he can still speak on those issues to the 50% of people there who live in rural areas, and also emphasize his business background, which will play to the more establishment, business-y Republicans there",

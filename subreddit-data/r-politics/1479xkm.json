If Xi thought only of the good of China (ofc he doesnt), he'd do exactly like India: play both sides.\n\nSo what wouldnt you trust ? It s in China and Xi's interest to get the americans to pay again...\n\nOne thing is sure: China (like India) couldnt give two fucks about Ukraine, is not responsible for any of it and would have much rather have Russia shut the fuck and let the money flow in.",

Xi spent the trade war riling up his supporters and consolidating power unlike any other Chinese leader since Mao. Now he has the power and geopolitics are lining up nicely for northern expansion into water rich areas of Russia. China doesn't need Taiwan if they  secure land corridors. Just my two hardly informed cents",

Problem is it s a disaster at home: HK is unstable, people wont make children, americans stopped paying, the populace is getting restless, they re being left behind and it s more and more obvious the Chinese dream is a mirage.\n\nI live in Hong Kong myself, and I dont feel like Xi consolidated power: he s making instead the party's stance untenable and its legitimacy quite discussed.",

To have the possibility of communication and partnership with China\u2019s scientists and public health experts if/when another highly communicable disease originates there so we can fend off a potential pandemic.

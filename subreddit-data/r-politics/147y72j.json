That's what people struggle to understand, and that's why it's difficult for someone who isn't as stupid as him to emulate his 'success.'\n\nTrump is not a smart person. He is not a clever person. He is not a well-measured person. He is an impulsive little shit who boasts no loyalty to anything other than himself and his own ego, including objective reality.\n\nTrump personifies the firehouse of falsehoods because he doesn't stop to think about whether something is true. He doesn't plan his moves. He just says whatever bullshit makes him feel the best, with the utmost of confidence. He doesn't act like he's lying because in his mind... lying just isn't a thing to worry about. I think he's aware that objective reality is out there. He just does not care about it at all. He is unbothered and confident as he tells you, with a smile on his face and tears in his eyes, that the sun rose in the west the morning he was born. And in the moment he says it he believes it, because it helps him and makes him feel good. Five minutes later he's forgotten about it and will deny ever having said it, unless he likes the way that you act when you tell him about it.\n\nFor Trump, things are not true because they agree with reality. Things are true because they fit the mythology of Trump. And so he spouts of ludicrous falsehoods with alarming alacrity, not because he is trying to confuse you, but because he knows of no other way to exist.\n\nIt only works in politics because politicians are used to speaking and acting in a way that is very measured and cautious and double-speaky, and Trump's firehose of falsehoods comes off as sincere because it is so bold and brash.",

It was lawful for him to have the documents until he wasn\u2019t president anymore. Then it wasn\u2019t, and he was unlawfully retaining them. He wouldn\u2019t have been unlawfully retaining them if he hadn\u2019t physically taken them from the White House.\n\nIf I rent a car and intentionally never return it, then am criminally charged for Grand Theft Auto, would you argue that I wasn\u2019t being charged for taking it?\n\nThe point is that charges 1-31 do not require a showing the he refused to return the docs when asked, or that he lied, obstructed, etc. They do require proving that he took them, as part of proving the willful element of willful retention.",

I don\u2019t understand why!\u201d\n\nTo this God replied, \u201cI sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?\u201d",

You can see Saints venerated as supernatural and depicted with glowing halos in the stained glass windows.  You can hear sermons that differentiate between a father, his son, and a holy spirit as distinct supernatural entities.  \n\nIf you say \"this is polytheistic,\" you get fired.  You lose your job.  You lose your social standing and connections.  If you say, \"this is clearly a monotheistic religion that we have with only one godlike entity in it\" you are demonstrating faith and loyalty.  If you are loyal, you get to run a church.  People respect you and ask you for help with their problems.  You are important and you get to lead a happy life.  The Catholic church simply isn't a polytheistic organization.  So any sort of argument you might make about that point isn't useful.  It doesn't make your life better.  It doesn't really matter one way or another whether there is any logic to it.  By demonstrating acts of Faith, you prove loyalty and you climb the latter and you live well.\n\nThe GOP no longer functions as a traditional political party.  It just doesn't.  It's an organization built on loyalty above all else.  It's mostly an organization of highly religious people with thing in terms of faith being inherently good.\n\nHelping the economy, helping the planet is all just off the radar inside the org.  It's just about demonstrating loyalty to the GOP by repeating whatever the current messaging is.  As a GOP state rep, you don't personally get rich by mitigating long term insurance rate rise, or lowering climate change related health issues.  And a bunch of the rich backers of the GOP are True Believers.  They got rich, so they must have been doing something right, so they'll keep funding people who support their way of doing things.\n\nWhen you understand the localized power and incentive structures at play, it makes sense.",

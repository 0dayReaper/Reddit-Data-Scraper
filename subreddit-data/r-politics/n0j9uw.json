This gave me a very broad, open, and understanding interpretation of the world and religion growing up. \n\nMy mother later moved us (my sisters and I) over to a very evangelical denomination. It was immensely loud and cult like. I recognized it even then, though I was around 10/11 years old. People (adults) \"speaking in tounges\" while others (also supposedly adults) pretended to understand the gibberish and affirmed it with the likes of \"Amen!\" and \" Praise Jesus!\" at the top of their lungs. It still makes me cringe. They tried to teach us through these wierd Christian rock concerts, and it didn't feel spiritually connecting at all. Once they tried to have us believe that the earth was no more than 6000 years old, and that humans coexisted with dinosaurs. We were told there were even two of every dinosaur on Noah's arc. As one of those kids who was waay to into dinosaurs at the time, that was like a hundred red flags in one Sunday. I promptly skipped Sunday school at every opportunity I could get away with from that point forward.\n\nFast forward to the past 6 years, and it's like those beliefs are everywhere. Just like then, I now skip out any time someone tries to bring up hardline Christian beliefs (my whole family, minus my dad, included).\n\nLong story I know; for a short point. Just had to vent for a second. This \"push our backward holiness on thou\" charade just sets me off sometimes.",

According to the story I\u2019m familiar with, the Pharisees were jealous or angry with Jesus because his message (Im the real deal son of God) undermined their own authority. So in that regard you\u2019re not super far off. The J man was convicted, essentially, for undermining traditional authorities. \n\nThe Romans were more of the enforcers, and in most traditions Pilate was pretty conflicted about the whole affair. He recognized that the Pharisees had railroaded the J man (nighttime trial, very irregular). He wanted to let the J man off, perhaps because the J man had previously been quite popular in Israel. But when he was brought to the Forum, it was filled with an anti-J man crowd and they famously made Pilate pardon a murderer rather than J man. Pilate shrugged his shoulders, literally washed his hands of the affair, and then went home (to his palace, not Rome.)",

            "comment": "Two of the groups that spoke were Alliance Defending Freedom &amp; the Family Research Council, led by Tony Perkins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a great article detailing the most sinister part about these bills, in that they are being written by a few white Christian nationalist groups, such as:\n\n* Alliance Defending Freedom\n* Heritage Foundation\n* Family Research Council\n* American College of Pediatricians\n* American Family Association\n* Focus on the Family\n* Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (aka Project Blitz)\n* Christian Voice\n* Kelsey Coalition\n* Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church\n* Family Policy Alliance\n* Concerned Women for America\n* Liberty Counsel\n\nJust to name a few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these groups are listed under the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups. **The biggest one right now is Alliance Defending Freedom.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to writing the North Carolina bill this year, forcing teachers to oust students who display \"gender nonconforming behavior\" and not allowing healthcare to our trans community to anyone under 21, over the last 28 years, the Alliance Defending Freedom has defended laws prohibiting:\n\n* ***same-sex intimacy;***\n* ***marriage, adoption, and surrogacy for same-sex couples;***\n* ***attacked LGBTQ non-discrimination laws, as well as bans on conversion therapy for minors;***\n* ***argued in favor of laws that require transgender people to undergo sterilization before legally changing their gender;***\n* ***challenged access to contraception; and***\n* ***supported the criminalization of abortion at any stage of pregnancy.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts work stretches beyond the United States; ADF has, for instance:\n\n* [***championed***](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/splc-report-dangerous-liaisons.pdf) ***Belize\u2019s archaic anti-sodomy law, which allows for the persecution and imprisonment of gay people.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The ADF\u2019s overarching position on gay people is that they should either be converted to heterosexuality or fired from their jobs and imprisoned because of their sexual orientation. This stance has earned the group a controversial [designation](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom) as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***When GOP state legislators began to push \u201cbathroom bills\u201d in 2016 and 2017, it was ADF that*** [***ghostwrote the model legislation***](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/alliance-defending-freedom-lobbies-anti-lgbt-bathroom-bills/) ***and*** [***lobbied for it behind the scenes***](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/law-firm-linked-anti-transgender-bathroom-bills-across-country-n741106)***.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are all astroturfing under a group named [PromisetoAmerica'sChildren](https://promisetoamericaschildren.org/about-us/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe [article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/04/short-history-anti-trans-stuff-came-concerned/) lists out the fact these groups were butt-hurt about losing the gay marriage Obergefell case, and now they are bullish on taking rage against the transgender community in retaliation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-lgbtq-coalition-targets-equality-act-name-america-s-children-n1258884](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-lgbtq-coalition-targets-equality-act-name-america-s-children-n1258884)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese horrible monsters are just intent to terrorize people in the name of religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is they have a major lobbying group behind them, basically swaying legislators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The leader of Focus on the Family, James Dobson*** (whom Mike Pence called his inspirational role model), even started an [astroturf group known as the Women's Liberation Front (WOLF)](https://www.transadvocate.com/fake-radical-feminist-group-actually-paid-political-front-for-anti-lgbt-james-dobson-organization_n_20207.htm) for TERFs to basically make it look like a feminist website, even though he's a white evangelical male. These guys bear false witness and think it's okay because it's about stopping *\"The Queer Agenda\"*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese groups all take as White Christian Nationalist Groups their directions from a leader known as RJ Rushdoony, who came up with the idea known as Christian Reconstruction. It seeks to instill Biblical law into government, creating Christian theocracy. Rushdoony had been quoted in saying many things, such as this quote:\n\n&gt;*Fundamentalist Christians must take control of governments and impose strict biblical law on America and the world. That would mean the death penalty for \"practicing homosexuals,\" among many other \"abominators.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough most fundamentalist leaders now deny holding Reconstructionist beliefs, several \u2014 including Beverly and Tim LaHaye (Author of the book series Left Behind &amp; founder of Concerned Women for America), Donald Wildmon (see American Family Association) and D. James Kennedy (see Coral Ridge Ministries) \u2014 did serve alongside Rushdoony and other Chalcedon associates on the Coalition for Revival, a group formed in 1981 to \"reclaim America.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese groups have been advocates for conversion therapy, banning of pornography, and have openly stated that LGBTQ+ people are pedophiles that must be stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* From James Dobson\n\n&gt;\"The homosexual agenda is a beast. It wants our kids.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* From another group, known as the Traditional Values Coalition:\n\n&gt;*\"As homosexuals continue to make inroads to the public schools, more children will be molested and indoctrinated into the world of homosexuality.* *Gay-Straight Alliances on high school campuses are also part of a plot to \"target children for recruitment\" to gay sex, cross-dressing and sex-change operations*.\"\n\nSo, if you ever wonder who is working behind these bills, look no further than these groups. It's just a bunch of Christian Nationalist organizations that want to instill Christian theocracy onto the United States, making everyone swear on the Bible again. These groups are beyond repugnant, and their stances in the past reflect that.",

The Federal Election Commission fined the campaign Perkins ran $3,000 for attempting to hide the money paid to Duke.\n\n\u200b\n\nTony Perkins is a White Supremacist, and he paid the grand wizard of the KKK for his mailing list to gain his following. The Family Research Council is nothing more than a klan order trying to instill a white Christian theocracy onto the United States. That is all that needs to be said about them. Let's keep going, though.\n\n\u200b\n\nHere are some of the things Tony Perkins stated:\n\n* *One of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the 'prophets' of a new sexual order.\"*\n* *\u201cWhile activists like to claim that pedophilia is a completely distinct orientation from homosexuality, evidence shows a disproportionate overlap between the two. \u2026 It is a homosexual problem.\u201d*\n* *\"Those who understand the homosexual community \u2014 the activists \u2014 they're very aggressive, they're \u2014 everything they accuse us of they are in triplicate. They're intolerant, they're hateful, vile, they're spiteful. .... To me, that is the height of hatred, to be silent when we know there are individuals that are engaged in activity, behavior, and an agenda that will destroy them and our nation.\"*\n* \u201c*Gaining access to children has been a long-term goal of the homosexual movement.\u201d*\n* *\u201c\\[W\\]elcoming open homosexuality in the military would clearly damage the readiness and effectiveness of the force \u2013 in part because it would increase the already serious problem of homosexual assault in the military.\u201d*\n* *\u201cThe reality is, homosexuals have entered the Scouts in the past for predatory purposes.\u201d*\n* *\u201cThe videos are titled 'It Gets Better.' They are aimed at persuading kids that although they'll face struggles and perhaps bullying for 'coming out' as homosexual (or transgendered or some other perversion), life will get better. \u2026It's disgusting. And it's part of a concerted effort to persuade kids that homosexuality is okay and actually to recruit them into that lifestyle.*\n* *\u201cFamily Research Council believes that homosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never be affirmed. It is by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and psychological health effects.\u201d*\n* *\u201c\\[Homosexuality\\] \u2026 embodies a deep-seated hatred against true religion.\u201d*\n* *\u201cBy ignoring underlying conditions, the demands of transgender supremacy ignore our unique kids, especially those with autism and mental health diagnoses. They deflect much-needed resources away from the pandemic of autism.\u201d*\n\nEnough said. Tony Perkins, the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family are all hate mongers who wish to have all us queer folk completely exterminated. They are the definition of a hate group. Why are we still allowing Christian Nationalist groups to craft legislation, when they are intent to harming our communities we are supposed to love, include, and aid to the best of our abilities?",

(I'm new to reddit and not sure if I can post links to them).\n\nThird, here's an update: \n\nMy trial for \"disorderly conduct\" is currently set for late August 2021 in criminal court here in Little Rock; the charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 30 days in jail simply for speaking to my elected officials. \n\nNearly two months later, I am still in shock that this happened. \n\nI served in the US Army from 1993 - 2004, and never imagined I'd be thanked for that service by being thrown in jail for telling elected officials how their hateful laws affect my family, my friends, colleagues and employees in the transgender community. \n\nA bright light needs to be shone on the Republican Party of Arkansas.\n \nState Senators like Breanne Davis, Stanley Rapert, Bart Hester, Trent Garner, Missy Elliot (and quite a few more) are pushing HARD to make it impossible for people who are transgender to live in this state: they make no attempt to mask their hate. \n\nSenator Breanne Davis told me that she was concerned that transgender kids are \"just a fad.\"  Bart Hester thinks that parents are forcing babies to change genders because \"they wanted a boy and got a girl.\" They are out of control, ignorant, and do not believe that every American is entitled to dignity and civil liberties. \n\nThe Arkansas Republican Party is bad news, and there is little investigation done into their backgrounds, their financial relationships with Alliance Defacing Freedom and other hate groups and white supremacy organizations, simply because Arkansas is a small state with little money or national political influence. \n\nIf you have the resources to look into their backgrounds, there are skeletons to be found.\n\nI will keep everyone posted with any major developments, but my focus is on doing everything I can to protect the trans community here in Arkansas.  \n\nPeace,\nChris",

It's an attack on civil rights dressed up as a solution looking for a problem.\n\nYou know what's funny is that the anti occupy bill that passed in the Idaho legislature to stop the Occupy Boise camp from camping near the Boise Capitol building ended up being useless in intent but unconstitutional in practice.\n\n In the bill that they passed into law, they did not address camping on public federal land, on which the camp was located.\n\n As such, the bill had absolutely no impact on the occupy Boise protest camp.\n\n\nIt was later used to harass and prosecute people experiencing homelessness.\n\nIn the court case Martin V Boise, advocates for the homeless community argued that it was cruel and unusual punishment and now it is perfectly legal to camp outside on public property if there is no Room in a nearby shelter.\n\nI call it the Luke 2:7 decision.\n\nI guess what I'm saying here is that legislation often has unintended consequences, especially  when the intent behind the legislation was to limit civil liberties.",

A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.\n\n&gt;Written during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler\u2019s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who **becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.**\n\n&gt;Called \u201ca message to thinking Americans\u201d by the Springfield Republican when it was published in 1935, It Can\u2019t Happen Here is a shockingly prescient novel that remains as fresh and contemporary as today\u2019s news.\n\nRemember, the party flip was after the southern strategy in the 60s... \"Thinking Americans\" from a Republican then isn't the Republicans we know today.\n\n&gt;save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.\n\nAlmost describes every fucking \"republican\" (fascist) today.",

You know what We told our son, own your truth love who you are and those that have a problem , that is their problem not yours. We love our son And both my husband and I could not be more proud of him and the man he is. I just feel like all these people that spend so much time and energy , anti-this an anti-that with the LGBTQ could maybe educate themselves and show compassion, empathy and start having conversations with people instead of going out of their way to get involved in bans.

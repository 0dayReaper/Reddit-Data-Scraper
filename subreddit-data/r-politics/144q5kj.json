Got a check from conservative donors, then decided to testify before  the house while refusing to testify before the Senate.  \n\nAn actual whistleblower testifies because something was wrong, not because they were already fired and paid by operatives.",

Seems like the agent went to PV and did not disclose it. Thus Dems are making it out to be that the leaked info has no validity which it does. Still have to take it seriously and investigate it. If you have another story then have at it. FBI and CIA should be non political which has not been the case in forever.",

Other Democrats on the subcommittee made reference to the difficulty of asking meaningful questions of those testifying, given that they had no prior knowledge of who they were or what they'd be testifying about.\n\nGoldman is the one who had the instinct to ask who'd been paying these guys since they'd been fired from the FBI.\n\nHe's also the one who invoked the rules to silence MTG in a meeting where she called the Secretary of Homeland Security a liar.",

            "comment": "One of House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan's, R-Ohio, so-called FBI \"whistleblowers\" is facing questions about whether he lied under oath about receiving financial support from longtime Trump ally Kash Patel, according to The Guardian. \n\nFormer FBI agent Garrett O'Boyle testified last week in Jordan's investigation into what Republicans have called the \"weaponization\" of agencies like the FBI against conservatives. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., asked O'Boyle during the hearing whether Patel was helping to fund his legal defense.\n\n\"Not that I'm aware of,\" O'Boyle replied.\n\nHowever, during a February interview with the House of Representatives weaponization subcommittee, O'Boyle stated that his legal fees were being paid for by Fight With Kash, or the Kash Foundation, a nonprofit organization helmed by Patel, according to The Guardian.\n\nAdditionally, a Democratic staff report published in March indicated that Patel had appointed former Trump attorney Jesse Binnall to be O'Boyle's counsel. The Guardian reported that Binnall is on the board of directors for the Kash Foundation.\n\nJordan, a staunch Trump ally, dismissed the scrutiny surrounding O'Boyle.\n\n\"Yet again the Democrats distorted the facts in their report on our brave FBI whistleblowers. Jesse Binnall is representing Mr. O'Boyle pro bono,\" a Jordan spokesperson told The Guardian.\n\nBut Goldman said the contradiction raises a serious issue.\n\n\"Mr. O'Boyle's answers in the subcommittee hearing on Thursday appear to contradict his previous testimony in the transcribed interview with subcommittee staff,\" Goldman told The Guardian. \"In order to ensure witnesses are truthful when they come before the subcommittee, Chairman Jordan must determine whether or not Mr. O'Boyle lied under oath on Thursday.\"",

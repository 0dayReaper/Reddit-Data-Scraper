That's the bulk of the indictment, he has a whopping 31 counts for violating 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793(e). While he technically *could* be sentenced consecutively (which would means a 310 year sentence if convicted on all 31 of those counts), I kind of doubt that would happen. Probably would be served concurrently, which would mean a maximum of 10 years in prison for counts 1-31.\n\n18 U.S. Code \u00a7 794 is basically about providing the information to a foreign government for the purposes of harming the USA, or communicating such information to an enemy during times of war. And yeah...that's some Rosenberg shit. That allows for being executed, or serving a life sentence. \n\nThere are similarities, but there's also some big differences. Also, neither require *selling* the documents. \n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/794\n\nNot a lawyer here, but my understanding is that the far more serious 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 794 is less about whether or not money changed hands and more about who that information was being provided to. Trump could show the documents to an enemy nation, and that could mean the death penalty regardless of if he got paid. Meanwhile, showing it to his maid or his janitor just to look cool would fall under the 10 years in prison maximum. \n\nTrump also has 5 charges that fall under obstruction of justice statutes, and those have a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. \n\nHe also is being charged of violating one count of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1001(a)(2), which is a fraud/false statements charge and carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison.",

                    "comment": "This is a good time to recap the ACTUAL circumstances around the Hillary Clinton email conspiracy hoax which still persists to this day.\n\nAlthough I don't wish to hear from her privileged but fully law-abiding ass ever again, I'm getting sick of the harmful laziness of pundits and journalists and others naively falling back into the pattern of regurgitating GOP myths about HRC, people just erroneously and carelessly just repeating the verbal tics about her supposedly awful mishandling and possible criminal conduct.\n\nIt wasn't.  That's just the right wing drumbeat.  And the words from a incompetent James Comey.\n\nFact check reminder: she ran the IDENTICAL email setup as two dozen other GOP and Democrat officials.  It was 100% legal and there wasn't a single rule against it at the time.  \n\nWhen corrupt GOP entities went after her in bad faith YEARS later, a court ordered her to produce all relevant work emails... which she did.  They scoured them and found NOTHING.  She was given permission to do the normal and proper administrative step of clearing the servers.\n\nMuch later, the same corrupt liars forced her to give them the servers, which, again, she complied with.  They did recovery on the cleared servers, restoring &gt;99% of the contents, which was again scoured exhaustively and found to be PERFECTLY LEGAL AND NORMAL.  The only suspect emails found were some where she discussed wedding planning with her daughter during work hours.  That's as clean as government worker as you'll get.\n\nThen the same corrupt GOP ratfuckers invented a hoax of her \"hiding\" emails.  Didn't happen.  The servers were cleared, and the &lt;1% of data that couldn't be recovered are what they're falsely alleging she \"hid\".\n\nThe supposedly classified ones have also been grossly misrepresented by enemies.  All were emails she received, not sent.  And most were errors on the part of the sender, not HRC.  People also sent material that lacked proper classification marking.  Her culpability in this is so tiny and yet so broadly misreported.\n\nAnd she would have had zero control over which of the bits the recovery process was unable to recover at the margins.  And all they know is how many bytes they couldn't recover.  Those bytes could have been 1,000 normal text emails, or 30,000 really tiny ones, or 10 big attached PowerPoint decks, or one long video.  Or could have blank space.  Or some combination of those data elements.  Nobody knows, but guess which spin the GOP hoaxsters put on it?  Yep, the 30,000 \"deleted\" emails hoax.\n\nAnd even that was guilty projection from the earlier revelations that GWB had actually and purposely deleted 30 *million* emails, and did so *after* being ordered explicitly by the court not to.  \n\nThanks to republican misconduct and misogyny, she's the most investigated politician of all time.  And nobody has found so much as a parking offence. Creeps like Chuck Grassley and Brett Kavanaugh and Orrin Hatch and Kenneth Starr spent decades trying to find one speck of bad conduct.  Trump and all the modern contemporary GOP colluded with enemies like Russia and Saudi Arabia to unearth evidence. They found... nothing.   \n\nYet here we are, years later, and lazy journalists are still repeating the false talking points of GOP and useful idiot James Comey, and even here, well meaning people are still falling for the hoax that her handling was somehow reckless or even criminal, despite the facts and the context.  \n\nI hope I never hear from her again.  Her presence taunts and inspires additional attacks and increased disinformation from domestic terrorists and enemy propagandists.  Her ill-advised posting of memes just reinforces people on both sides to think that maybe there is some kernel of truth to the hoaxes.  The best service she could do to the country now is retire in obscurity.  Maybe that's not fair on a selfish individual level.  But on a \"saving our country from incredibly organized and committed foreign and domestic enemies level\", her keeping a low profile would be her own unique Medal of Honor conduct at this point.\n\nFor our small part of responsible civic service, let's stop tolerating and spreading the GOP hoax that she did anything illegal or unusual.",

It took guts to defend late term abortions on a national stage, and she galvanized women around the world with her speech at the UN when she declared that women\u2019s rights are human rights. \n\nIf she had crawled away and hid, allowed herself to be silenced, what kind of a message would that have sent to other women? I don\u2019t think you understand that she was an inspiration to many, even those who didn\u2019t necessarily support her politically. That\u2019s why she polled as the most admired woman in the world for over 25 years, a poll in which you can namr any woman including your grandma or teacher.",

Didn't say that.  I'm saying she should stop NOW.  \n\nPlus your characterization of her current attention seeking speech is way false also.  She's not out there boosting women and saving babies.\n\nMost of it is selling her books.  Or podcasts.  Or doing jokey taunts... such as this very week.  That's useless self-serving bullshit that does more harm than good.  \n\nSince you've tried invoking my grandmother, let me tell you a couple things about her.  During wartimes, she in fact made many personal sacrifices... but they were for the larger good of the country.  It would be nice if Hillary could do some of that starting now, and as a bonus, it would be nice if you wouldn't encourage her to put her own personal ego over the existential threat to our country.  And another thing about my grandmother was a phrase she taught me: discretion is the better part of valor.  Just because you *can* pop off and say something, doesn't mean that's the best choice.",

It being technically legal at the time is one of those areas where both her and her husband often come out looking bad.  Nobody likes a rules lawyer.\n\nAlso, her handling of the entire affair was horrible.  She was never honest nor forthright about it (a constant for her).  From her \"like with a cloth\" comment to her claims that the FBI was just doing a security audit to her somehow being allowed to decide what was relevant to the FBI's investigation, she was simply terrible about the entire thing.  The only reason that it resurfaced just before the election was because she was constantly downplaying it and being dishonest about the entire thing.\n\n&gt;well meaning people are still falling for the hoax that her handling was somehow reckless or even criminal, despite the facts and the context.\n\nIt was reckless.  She's not unique there, by any means (heck, a bunch of people in Trump's administration did the same exact thing), but lets not pretend that she was doing the right thing or following best practices here.",

Biden had some circles and squares at home that he brought back to school, but maybe some of those red circles took from the playroom before playtime started which teacher wouldn\u2019t like. Trump took lots of circles and squares home, but keeps hiding the squares when teacher comes to visit, lying about how many squares he has at home, moving squares to his parents house, etc. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter whether Trump\u2019s squares are red or green, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re squares and the teacher wanted them back!",

Even if the squares ARE red, he\u2019s indicted because they\u2019re squares, not because they are red. It\u2019s in important distinction (due to EO13524 and unanswered legal questions about the limits of classification authority).\n\nThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s getting lost. \n\nEvery single one of the indicted counts involves a statute that does not invoke the classification status of the materials AT ALL. Only that they held NDI and weren\u2019t returned. (Aka the \u2018Trump tried to keep the classroom toys\u2019 bit) Trump could have potentially declassified ALL of those documents, and made them green squares. But they\u2019d still be squares.",

Primary I voted Bernie but I'm not a bro (for instance I did not vote for Helen gym for Philly mayor who was endorsed by sanders) ok enough justification. \n\nI welcome anyone who has facts otherwise, as well. Just trying to get at the truth. \n\nUnsecured (to the level it should be) private email server, initially in her basement but then contracted out. That's sloppy and probably about control. Not great but not deemed illegal.\n\nShe did have people hammer a couple phones. It's not clear to me if that was because that was her standard security practice when switching phones, or if it was done to hide evidence. The articles I've read don't seem to know, but again, the FBI didn't charge. \n\nWhen the FBI reviewed the server there were a handful of classified docs, with a number (under ten I think) which were top secret. Again not good, but turned over and nothing illegal found. \n\nFrom what I understand, the wiped server(s) (the bleachbit application) did not contain anything relating to government: they were already deemed to be personal. A contractor wiped them. \n\nSource is mainly [this vox article.](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12774948/fbi-hillary-clinton-report) I found others which seemed to lean toward Hilary so I went for what seemed like the least bias piece. I dunno I usually like Vox's explained articles at least as a jump off. \n\nLots here. It's not nothing. But wasn't criminal. And the idea that the FBI was in the tank for her doesn't add up considering Comey coming out and publicizing this during an election even though no charges were being brought.\n\nWould love sane conversation about this to get it straight.\n\nEdit: there's tonssss I left out. Obviously no mention of Benghazi because I really feel like the right trumped that shit up.",

And he, I mean, he is constantly manipulating him. There are stories of Putin purposely bringing a young, beautiful woman as a translator with him and then showing her off to Trump and saying, \u201cSee, look what\u2014,\u201d and Trump being completely distracted by this young, beautiful woman. \n\nThe fact that Trump speaks in short, simple, declarative sentences that Putin can understand, that\u2019s his level of English, that gives him extra time to speak and formulate his thoughts back to\u2014while the translators are working, that gives him extra time to formulate his thoughts back to Trump. \n\nThe vanity that he sees in Trump, that he can flatter him, that he can say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a colorful person,\u201d and that it gets mistranslated as \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and then Trump thinks, \u201cOh, this strong leader of a superpower that has nuclear weapons thinks I\u2019m brilliant.\u201d That just a couple compliments will go such a long way with this man that he can basically\u2014his security services can try to influence an election and that Trump is then\u2014and influence it in Trump\u2019s favor, and that Trump is then told about it and Trump loves him forever as a result because he sees Putin as his ally, right? All of this allows Putin to just constantly be eating his lunch, right? And Putin knows this very well. And everybody who was in the room with them, ever, just saw how masterfully Putin manipulated Trump.\u201d",

When your client is recorded doing/saying most of the core things they're accused of, the best you can hope for is to exclude those recordings somehow.  I would expect them to move to exclude nearly all the evidence, but if Cannon starts issuing rulings like that they can be appealed by the prosecution.  Cannon has already been overturned pretty harshly by the 11th circuit for her previous calls in the early part of this case.  If Cannon doesn't recuse herself there's always the possibility that the 11th circuit will do it for her at the request of the prosecution.  I don't think Jack Smith is going to tolerate a lot of judicial shenanigans on a case like this, so I'm hopeful that Cannon is unable to put much spin on the ball here.  Unfortunately, we get to find out either way.",

I haven\u2019t seen any reason to believe Smith will allow loose Cannon to turn this into a circus.  TNR had an interesting write up on all the crap she might pull\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/173543/aileen-cannon-trump-judge-classified-docs-worry\n\n\u201c\nFor starters, she sets the date of the trial, so she can delay when it actually starts, perhaps till after the 2024 election. She can also take steps to ensure the jury is filled with Trump supporters.\n\nCannon could rule that attorney-client privilege was improperly breached, which would mean some crucial evidence would have to be tossed. (Many of the most damning things in the indictment came from notes from Trump\u2019s lawyer.)  She could also disqualify the prosecution\u2019s witnesses or evidence and humor the defense\u2019s objections or requests.\n\nShe can determine that there\u2019s no reason for a jury to find Trump guilty and rule for an acquittal, or she can even declare a mistrial altogether. None of her decisions can be appealed until after the trial concludes, so it could be a long time before the Justice Department is able to follow up.\n\u201c",

Technically he hadn\u2019t violated anything as he was the sitting president when he left DC with the docs in his possession. \n\nHe became the ex-president in Florida and that\u2019s when the crime began.  So technically none of his criminal actions happened in DC. Again, it\u2019s a technicality but that\u2019s how the courts work sometimes.

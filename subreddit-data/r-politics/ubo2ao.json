            "comment": "&gt;Activist Chaz Stevens has filed a complaint with eight school districts in Florida challenging the Bible\u2019s place in schools after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and GOP state legislators passed a \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d meant to keep \u201cprohibited topics\u201d like racism and LGBTQ issues out of the classroom.  \nStevens cites examples directly from the tome to prove that the Bible is too \u201cwoke\u201d to be available to young students.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]Stevens, an atheist, is turning the tables on Bible-beating conservatives who touted the law. Listing multiple examples of \u201cprohibited content,\u201d Stevens backed up his assertions with chapter and verse.  \n\u201cWith the constant concerns about teaching Critical Race Theory, should we not take stock of the Bible\u2019s position on slavery? I am concerned our young white students will read such passages and wake up to civilization\u2019s sordid past,\u201d he wrote in his complaint.",

It stopped any local authority (councils, schools, etc.) from placing \"pretended homosexual relationships\" at the same validity as \"natural relationships,\" basically a vague law that restricted discussion about gay relationships in schools.\n\nThe effect of this is that it makes queer kids feel lesser, it gives other kids carte blanche to bully anyone who doesn't present cis-straight, it removes all potential role models and in the end isolates and introverts kids. This damage lasts decades. It's horrendous. It needs to stop.",

This takes it out of the hands of local/state politicians and moves it to a higher court, which is almost certainly more likely to rule against such laws.\n\nThe documentary [\"Hail Satan?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27RtJp-rhHk) shows a few great examples of this, and is really well done.",

Since Onan didn't want to raise another man's kids, but did also still want to get his dick wet, he married her, but just pulled out. So God kills him too. The third boy in line to get Tamar is too young, so father-in-law Judah tells her to live as a widow. \n\nTamar then goes to the temple, covers her face, and waits for FIL Judah to come but to try to pay her for sex, which he does with some of his personally identifying trinkets, which he only did because he didn't know it was actually Tamar. When it's revealed that she's knocked up, Judah, who knocked her up, tries to put her to death for prostitution until she produces his ring and other items that proves he's the dad. Judah did a bad thing by not marrying off his underage son to bang his daughter-in-law and she was so righteous she literally prostituted herself out to get children anyway! \n\nWhat a lesson in faith! Why would this ever be banned from schools?",

(HHMMM LETS GET RID OF TANF FOOD STAMPS!) Hell, *multiple* verses in the old testament outright say charging subprime interest is a *sin*, its called \"usery\". (WOW WHAT ARE STUDENT AND PAYDAY LOANS?!)\n\nNew testament has Jesus often speaking about giving up all worlds possession in pursuit of help those in need, and even directly deals with the pharisees when confronted whether they should pay taxes to the occupying Roman government. (MUH LIBERTARIAN FREEDUMBS) Any Christian that outwardly harasses anyone about social program spending is immensely sanctimonious. What exactly was the Good Samaritan parable supposed to be other than a call for Healthcare for those minority groups in need? (FREELOADERS I TELL YA, DAMN SAMARITANS)\n\nNothing makes sense about supply side Jesus, that guy just isn't real, except in the very twisted reality these cynical, self serving people live in. For a \"Christian\" nation we sure managed to gut the book and throw out all the inconvenience of liberal or progressive thought and keep most of the bigotry. Funny how that worked, isn't it? Now go on and make war against the gays, that will surely ensure your entrance to heaven, after all its easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a gay to have rights. That's what *their* good book said, according to JoBob the pastor.\n\nI can't stand evangelicals.",

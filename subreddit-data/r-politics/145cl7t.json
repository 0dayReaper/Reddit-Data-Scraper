            "comment": "Transcript of Jack Smith's statement that I just typed up (may not be perfect):\n\n&gt;Good afternoon, today an indictment was unsealed charging Donald J. Trump with felony violations of our national security laws as well as participating in a conspiracy to obstruct justice.  This indictment was voted by a grand jury of citizens in the Southern District of Florida, and I invite everyone to read it in full to understand the scope and the gravity the crimes charged.\n\n&gt;The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our armed forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people.  Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States and they must be enforced.\n\n&gt;Violations of those laws put our country at risk.  Adherence to the rule of law is a bedrock principle of the Department of Justice and our nation's commitment to the rule of law sets an example for the world. \n\n&gt;We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone.  Applying those laws, collecting facts, that's what determines the outcome of an investigation.  Nothing more, and nothing less.\n\n&gt;The prosecutors in my office are among the most talented and experienced in the Department of Justice.  They have investigated this case hewing to the highest ethical standards, and they will continue to do so as this case proceeds.\n\n&gt;It's very important for me to note that the defendants in this case must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.  To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial in this matter consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused.  We very much look forward to presenting our case. \n\n&gt;In conclusion, I would like to thank the dedicated public servants of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with whom my office is conducting this investigation and who work tirelessly every day upholding the rule of law in our country.  I'm deeply proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.  Thank you very much.",

Anywhere.\n\nIt allows our fleet's mere presence near a country to be more than sufficient power projection to get what we need, and it allows allies to understand no matter what happens that we can aid in their defense, and our research can be shared to iteratively improve each other's security when appropriate.

How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.

Today, an indictment was unsealed, charging Donald J. Trump with felony violations of our national security laws as well as participating in a conspiracy to obstruct justice. This indictment was voted by a grand jury of citizens in the Southern District of Florida, and I invite everyone to read it in full to understand the scope and the gravity of the crimes charged.\r  \n\r  \n\"The men and women of the United States Intelligence Community and our Armed Forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people. Our laws that protect National Defense Information are critical to the safety and security of the United States, and they must be enforced.\r  \n\r  \n\"Violations of those laws put our country at risk. Adherence to the rule of law is a bedrock principle of the Department of Justice, and our nation\u2019s commitment to the rule of law sets an example for the world.\r  \n\r  \n\"We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone. Applying those laws, collecting facts, that\u2019s what determines the outcome of an investigation. Nothing more and nothing less. The prosecutors in my office are among the most talented and experienced in the Department of Justice. They have investigated this case, hewing to the highest ethical standards, and they will continue to do so is this case proceeds.\r  \n\r  \n\"It\u2019s very important for me to note that the defendants in this case must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial on this matter, consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused. We very much look forward to presenting our case to a jury of citizens in the Southern District of Florida.\r  \n\r  \n\"In conclusion, I would like to thank the dedicated public servants of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with whom my office is conducting this investigation and who work tirelessly every day, upholding the rule of law in our country. I\u2019m deeply proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them. Thank you very much.\"",

A couple of things stand out.\n\nThe DoJ uses Trump's own words while he was attacking Clinton to demonstrate that he knew the importance of handling national security information. It's delicious.\n\nThe case is really going to be the security camera footage. They know down to the minute each time the boxes were moved and who moved them. \n\nThey are also using data from one or more of his lawyers. A lot of the obstruction case shows the timing of the boxes moving with Trump's actions relevant to each move as documented by his own lawyer. \n\nThey're only charging him with stuff they have hard, bullet proof evidence for, a recording or a video. Nothing is based on eye witnesses.",

What is wild is that you can see where they are using Trump Attorney 1s notes that he made since they are clearly quoting notes he took when he signed off on \"yes I found all relevamt docs\".  This guy literally took notes after every conversation with Trump to cover his ass because he KNEW how sketchy Trump is and might try to use him (which Trump was doing).\n\nBasically an attorney Trump hired found Trump so untrustworthy they took notes after every interaction and well for ass covering and seems like a pretty justified choice.  And it was ass covering that might actually put Trump in jail.  Fucking WILD.\n\nAny Trump attorney should do the same.",

He was alleged to have NDI docs (documents containing information related to national defense), and AFTER being informed of that fact, not appropriately supplying said documents. \n\nThe prosecution is going to try to prove that the 31 charges under that statute contained NDI, that they INFORMED Trump of them containing NDI (or he purposefully withheld that info), and that Trump still withheld the documents (knowing or likely knowing they contained NDI). \n\nThat\u2019s the crux of the argument.

Bedminster may not yet have been searched, but, uh, this sure does sound like he has classified documents there, so that may change, too.\n\nI'd imagine it would be a separate charge, as well, because unless I'm horribly mistaken (which is very much a possibility because IANAL), each individual document that is unlawfully retained can be a separate charge, should the prosecutors choose to pursue that avenue.\n\nSo we could see the FBI searching his Jersey dump, as well, but I kind of doubt it right now.",

So regardless of where any of the specific individual crimes and activities occurred  (e.g. the Bedminster incident), everything laid out in this indictment will be handled in the Florida court.\n\nThat being said, Jack Smith is also investigating the crimes around the 'stolen election' lies, the insurrection, the fake electors schemes, attempts to overturn the results of a national election, etc. When he is ready to hand up the indictment for those crimes, my guess is they will be tried in a DC court.",

In July 2021, at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey(\u201cThe Bedminster Club\u201d), during an audio-recorded meeting with a writer, a publisher, and two members of his staff, none of whom possessed a security clearance, TRUMP showed and described a \u201cplan of attack\u201d that TRUMP said was prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official. TRUMP told the individuals that the plan was \u201chighly confidential\u201d and \u201csecret.\u201d TRUMP also said, \u201cas president I could have declassified it,\u201d and, \u201cNow I can\u2019t, you know, but this is still a secret.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. In August or September 2021, at The Bedminster Club, TRUMP showed a representative of his political action committee who did not possess a security clearance a classified map related to a military operation and told the representative that he should not be showing it to the representative and that the representative should not get too close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParagraph 54:\n\n&gt;On May 23, 2022, TRUMP met with Trump Attorney 1 and Trump Attorney 2 at The Mar-a-Lago Club to discuss the response to the May 11 Subpoena. Trump Attorney 1 and Trump Attorney 2 told TRUMP that they needed to search for documents that would be responsive to the subpoena and provide a certification that there had been compliance with the subpoena. TRUMP, in sum and substance, made the following statements, among others, as memorialized by Trump Attorney 1:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a. I don\u2019t want anybody looking, I don\u2019t want anybody looking through my boxes, I really don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want you looking through my boxes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b. Well what if we, what happens if we just don\u2019t respond at all or don\u2019t play ball with them?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;c. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if we just told them we don\u2019t have anything here?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;d. Well look isn\u2019t it better if there are no documents?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth reading the whole thing, [US v Trump-Nauta 23-80101 (via CBS)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-text-trump-indictment-pdf-copy-unsealed-documents-case/). It's not legalese -- pretty straightforward. And it's short - it'd be fewer than 20 pages if you removed the double-spacing and all the blank space. Everything in it is based on video or audio recorded evidence... they literally have the receipts.",

Then the documents are all transferred to that site where it's guarded and the former president can access the files any time they want.  \n\nI would guess that wasn't done because the transfer of power and responsibility literally wasn't started until Jan 7 after the coup failed.  TFG thought he was going to still be president and prevented agencies from beginning their transfer work AT ALL. So NARA was stonewalled and wasn't authorized to setup the storage site ahead tomfoolery time... not that TFG intended to use it. \n\nA side note is that Presidents like Clinton and Obama don't have classified documents because they immediately had the documents transferred to setup their presidential libraries. the libraries are overseen by NARA directly, thus the law is fulfilled and classified documents are secured. \n\nThe VPs don't typically get libraries and usually part their papers out to universities or museums... which is why Biden and Pence still had documents in their control.  It would seem that we need to extend some form of library system to VPs as well. Biden was also a Senator and Congress' papers don't fall under the records act. Another area that needs to be addressed.",

A good rule of thumb for first time offenders is that they'll get somewhere between 25-75% of the maximum sentence for the most severe crime for which they're convicted of--more if the crime is particularly heinous and there are aggravating factors, and less if there are lots of mitigating factors.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Trump will get 10-30 years here, as the DOJ typically tries the throw the book at people who commit these crimes.

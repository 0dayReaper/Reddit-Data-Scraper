I feel like the days when we give POTUS a pass should be over.\n\nTraditionally the thought process was predicated on the fear that jailing a President for crimes committed while in office could create future incentives for authoritarian banana republic type governments.  That idea being that the leader of a country might be more reluctant to hand off power peacefully if they fear being jailed after their term.\n\nI think the antithesis of this argument is pretty obvious, that if a leader (and I use the term loosely) like Trump has no fear of repercussions they will have no incentive not to commit crimes while in office because they are without a conscience.",

They hadn\u2019t been declaring all their VAT (basically GST) for years.\n\nThey were caught because HMRC were auditing one of their customers completely unrelated and found two invoices from the tax dodgers. Using the invoice numbers and the dates they were able to estimate how much tax they should have been declaring and fined them 6 figures.\n\nThey\u2019d been doing it for years and had covered their own tracks but couldn\u2019t do anything about the other party.",

This was seen as a departure from their stance earlier in the year when the State AG's office asked if they would like to attribute privilege to the engineer, which an email from Trumps attorney's declined attributing privilege. These documents would really be more of communication and such dealing with the engineers work on a Trump property that had such a stark increase in value that arised suspicion as to the merits therein. This valuation on the property in 2015 allowed Trump to claim some 21 million dollar tax credit (that I'm unsure of) as well as directly increase his net worth.",

I feel like some people might find the following example enlightening.\n\n\nTo give a completely legal example of how rich people can cheat the system, look into how people theorize Mitt Romney got his Roth IRA to over $100 million back in 2012. For those who don't know, a Roth IRA is a tax advantaged savings account that provides tax-free gains but has strict limits because of the tax-free nature.\n\n\nWhat Mitt Romney probably did was he owned a company that did nothing. This company that did nothing was valued at fractions of a penny per share of stock...because it did nothing. He dumped as much of this stock into his Roth IRA as he legally could. Year after year. Eventually, this company which previously was valued at almost nothing bought a majority holding of Domino's Pizza just before it was revitalized. Once the company owned Domino's, and Domino's was doing well, it was re-valued, and all of the gains were tax free for Mitt Romney.\n\n\nThis was a perfectly legal way to be a leech on society. You have to be an already rich asshole to do it, but it's legal. The Trump family is so scummy that they can't even do shit legally. They've gotten away with this shit for Donald's entire life because society is corrupt to the core, and enough people could be bought off. It seems like Trump overstepped by letting people manipulate him into running for president, because now something like 80 million people are demanding his corrupt family be investigated, and there are mountains of publicly available information which all seem to indicate that the Trump Organization is criminal.\n\n\nThanks for reading my rant. I hope you found it informative. If you took the time to read that shit, let me know if you think I have anything incorrect.",

But his ego is so enormous that he just couldn't resist. He ran for the most vetted job in the world lmao. \n\nI think that also shows how broke he is or was. Could be that he had no choice and that's why he finally ran. He had lied for years that he'd run, just for attention. But he must have needed a really big boost so he actually went through with it and accidentally won. \n\nCould be a combination of the two. Either way, it's hilarious how much he's fucked not just himself but also his evil spawn",

I had an issue with the VA prior to COVID and reached out to Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin.\n\nSomeone from Baldwin\u2019s team has been following up on this for 2 years after RESOLUTION of the problem. Just reaching out and making sure everything is okay. During the problem someone contacted me once a week and even flew out to check things out.\n\nI think Ron Johnson is just busier. His automated or intern generated email said he takes veteran\u2019s issues seriously and someone would get back to me. He\u2019s not into all that talking about problems or addressing them or helping veterans or ensuring the VA maintains enough operating budget. Because he takes veteran\u2019s issues seriously\u2026 Fuck Ron Johnson.",

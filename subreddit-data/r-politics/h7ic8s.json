They've jumped at every chance to label anyone they could even vaguely tie to AntiFa as violent, anti american extremists. Plenty career politicians on the Left would like that too, but it's become completely tied in with the Rights whole narrative. And this is by design. Those leading the charge against AntiFa know exactly what they are doing: priming the american populace to see those fighting fascism as the enemy, rather than fascism itself. They are actively working towards building a fascist state.",

To most people the organization probably doesn\u2019t exist around here (although I\u2019m sure it does). \n\nI observed a high school class in the Northeast this year.  When we got to school integration and the Little Rock Nine the kids did not understand why KKK members were not arrested for lynchings. (This was before quarantine). And the teacher had to explain several times that the police attended and participated in the lynchings and that\u2019s why they just didn\u2019t arrest anyone. The kids were disturbed once they understood that there were police officers in the KKK. \n\nAlso I drove through Northwest Arkansas about five years ago on a cross country road trip. The KKK has recruitment billboards on the side of a public highway. I never want to go back to Arkansas and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how terrifying it must be to be black in Arkansas. \n\nRacism is a major problem in our country. We spent most of the 2000\u2019s pretending racism wasn\u2019t a thing anymore, but it just made white supremacy and systematic racism fly under the radar. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re finally taking it seriously, but it\u2019s frustrating (and flat out fucked up) that we\u2019ve been doing nothing about this for decades. For example it recently became a federal crime to lynch someone.",

There are Foreign Terror Organizations (FTO), which can be declared by the Secretary of State, but the law that authorizes that only applies to non-US based organizations.  There's simply no mechanism to declare a domestic organization a \"terrorist group,\" nor any relevant legislation on what it would mean if you could.  It would also be problematic and run afoul of the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of association.\n\nThe other problem is that there really isn't a Ku Klux Klan anymore.  There are about 30 different groups which claim lineage from the Klan and most are extremely small.  There are probably only a ~~few hundred~~ few thousand, at most, active self-described Klansmen in the United States today. ([Source](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/reports/state-of-the-kkk)).\n\nStealth Edit: The ADL estimates about 3,000 active Klansmen in the US.  The SPLC's estimate is about 6,000.",

I appreciate the concern that having the government be the one to designate hate groups could mean designation of groups that are anti-hate or simply anti-government as hate (and I agree that is a very real concern especially now), I worry that we're letting the slippery slope run away with us. But perhaps it's not that we need a more official list and that we just need the FBI to do its job better (which means rooting out the people in support of white supremacy). \n\nOur states have these designations of high threats- [NJ recently designated white nationalists as a whole to be the biggest threat to the state](https://thehill.com/homenews/news/484178-new-jersey-raises-terror-threat-level-for-white-supremacist-extremists-to-high), but from what I can find the [FBI has a \"list of threats\" that contains both groups and individuals](https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=751755) but it is not organized by threat level nor is it easy to find. I see a number of [white supremacist groups listed here](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-terrorist-threat-confronting-the-united-states) but no mention of the KKK (though the ones listed I believe are splinter groups so perhaps that's why). \n\nIt seems like the list cannot happen due to the First Amendment, but at the same time wasn't hate speech designated as not covered by the First Amendment when it is used to incite violence? As it stands now, it seems to me like this unofficial list is a way to avoid defense for or against groups- in other words it makes it easier domestically to label anyone a terrorist but at the same time allow people to let those they support avoid pursuance.",

I highly doubt many people would move more towards radical positions if this existed but bring people closer towards understanding each other and creating a future where everyone at least feels heard.

            "comment": "&gt;The State Department says a group must be a *foreign* organization who engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of the U.S. or American citizens to be listed as a terrorist organization.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This means that foreign groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda\u00a0are listed as terrorists, but the KKK are not.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The definition also suggests Trump may not be able to class\u00a0antifa\u00a0as terrorists, who are also seen as a movement rather than a coordinated organization.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;People who express far-right and white supremacist views are protected by the First Amendment. As domestic terrorism is not a federal offense, those accused of acting on behalf of the KKK or other far-right groups while carrying out an attack or other crimes can only face hate crimes charges.\n\nFor those of you asking why a group like the KKK wouldn't already be classified this way, and that may not have actually read the article, there's no legal grounds to designate a domestic group as terrorists.\n\nIn order to label them as such, the laws around how we designate terrorist groups would need to change. They can't just be officially classified as a terrorist group.\n\nI doubt many people that signed the petition actually understand what this designation means and how it's used. Likely, it simply sounds good to them to designate the KKK as a terrorist group because fuck the KKK.",

The Patriot Act was/is a knee jerk reaction where we sold our liberty in exchange for \"security.\" I have no doubt in my mind that America's fate is directly tied to that act. Hundreds of years after we are long gone and people are studying history, they will look at the Patriot Act as a turning point which (as many scholars, especially of antiquity) love to mark a moment that caused the collapse of a society....many will point to the Patriot Act as that galvanizing moment where we threw the Constitution in the trash and setup a surveying, police state. Idc if you are Repub or Democrat, the Patriot Act has been used by both parties to damaging affect. Allow it to persist with a narcissistic and racist demagogue in power and you can say goodbye to any sort of nation that our founding fathers ever envisioned.\n\nBin Laden either anticipated this or just got lucky, but either way...he turned this country on its head and our own legislature fell hook, line, and sinker for it (and the people havent batted an eye other than complaining that airports are \"annoying now.\").\n\nThe legislature that followed 9/11 did Bin Laden's bidding more than a kamikaze passenger plane ever could.",

[**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth), and  [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *\"90% desist\"* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.\n\nAccording to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).\n\nFor preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will \"desist\" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest. And transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. \n\nWithholding medical care from an adolescent who needs it is not a goddamn neutral option. Transition is absolutely necessary to keep many trans kids alive. Without transition a hell of a lot of them commit suicide. When able to transition rates of suicide attempts drop to the national average. And when prevented from transitioning or starting treatment until adulthood, those who survive long enough to start at 18+ enter adulthood facing thousands of dollars reconstructive surgery to repair damage that should have been prevented by starting treatment when they needed it.\n\nAnd not all that damage can be repaired. They will carry physical and psychological scars from being forced through the wrong puberty for the rest of their lives. They were robbed of their adolescence, forced to spend it dealing with the living hell of untreated dysphoria and the wrong puberty, trying to remain sane and alive while their bodies were warped in indescribably horrifying ways. Even with treatment as adults, some of them will be left permanently, visibly trans. In addition to the sheer horror of permanently having anatomy inappropriate to your gender, this means they will never have the option of blending into a crowd or keeping their medical history private. They will be exposed to vastly higher rates of anti-trans harassment, discrimination, abuse, and violence, all because they were denied the treatment they needed when they were young.\n\nThis is very literally life saving medical care. If there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. \n\nThis treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).\n\nBut if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. \n\nThis specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.\n\nThe only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)\n\nTransition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.

It has overwhelmingly proven to be very safe, gentle, and reversible.\n\nMost kids with precocious puberty don't have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal development. But it would still cause serious psychological damage to start puberty at the age of, say, 6, so they're put on treatment to delay it for a few years. This treatment has no long term side effects; it just puts puberty on hold. Stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off.

Again, gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4, and sometimes the gender a young person knows themselves to be is not the one they were assumed to be at birth. \n\nWhen this happens it can cause severe distress, the medical term for which is \"dysphoria\",  and if left untreated dysphoria can cause severe harm.\n\nThe treatment is to listen to the child or adolescent and believe them. That's what \"gender affirming care\" means. Supporting them as they figure out what they need and how best to express their gender. Sometimes including, if needed, medical care like (temporary, reversible) puberty delaying treatment to buy them more time before a permanent decision regarding what puberty they will go through has to be made. This treatment has no long term effects.\n\nIf by early adolescence a young person still strongly recognizes themselves as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances that they will \"desist\" are close to zero. Hormone treatment becomes an option then. Reconstructive genital surgery becomes an option in their late teens or early adulthood.\n\nThis is the only treatment for dysphoria that has proven effective. And it is *incredibly* effective. When unable to transition about 40% of trans youth attempt suicide, and rates of stress-related disorders like depression and anxiety are incredibly high. When able to transition and spared abuse and discrimination, rates of suicide attempts drop to the national average and trans youth are as psychologically healthy as the general public.\n\nWe don't know exactly why some people are trans. But they are, and we do know that transition fucking works. It vastly reduces risks of suicide, while dramatically improving mental health, social functionality, and quality of life for trans youth.",

When regular people see young detransitioners crying and exclaiming they ruined there life before it even began - all your statistics go out the window cause no parent wants that for their child.\n\nThat's actually a fantastic argument for transitioning, the rate of detransitioning is about 1%, with the majority of that being because of social or monetary pressure. \n\nIf you're against the treatment you're forcing a 100 times more to go through the same thing you claim to be against.",

Transition for preadolescents is purely social, and the first line of medical intervention is temporary and reversible puberty delaying treatment.\n\nThis treatment is incredibly well known because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in cis youth who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young.

The way this is getting pumped up on with the media you would think you couldn\u2019t go anywhere without running into someone in drag. As I see it who cares, if you want to see a show go, if you don\u2019t \u2026 then don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t seem hard, you have the freedom to go, you have the freedom to not go, isn\u2019t that why we fought for freedom?",

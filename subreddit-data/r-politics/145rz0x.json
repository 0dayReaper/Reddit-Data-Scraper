My Alma mater refers to itself as the 'maroon and gray', their school colors, and perhaps they may be horrified that they've been unknowingly perpetuating a racist campaign for over a century. \n\nIf we hunted down all the words of questionable origin in a fit of virtue signaling, I expect the language would be seriously depleted.",

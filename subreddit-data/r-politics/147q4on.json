They have him on tape showing classified documents to people he knew did not have the clearance to see them and telling them that he did not declassify them and that he no longer could since he was not the president any longer. They also have statements from his own lawyers that he lied about returning classified documents and wanted them to help him lie and obstruct the FBI who were trying to get the documents back.\n\nThis is so much worse than we even knew. It is also much, much worse than anything any other president (or Hillary) has done. In the other cases the mishandling of classified material was incidental and the investigations were fully cooperated with.\n\nTrump however knew what he took, did it in purpose, knowingly showed them to people he knew should not be able to see them and then knowingly lied and asked others to lie in order to keep the classified documents.\n\nThere is a very good chance he does jail on this.",

I mean, when you really think about it, we should be thanking Trump for going the extra mile to keep those documents safe!   Not only did he move them to make sure the spies can't see them, he went the extra mile to distract them by having his picture taken with them!  \n\nThe closest we have to evidence of wrongdoing would be a $2 billion payment to his daughter and son-in-law.  But why the hell would Saudi Arabia care about the nuclear program of one of its biggest enemies?  I mean seriously, do you care about what people you don't like are doing day to day?  of course not.  So why would Saudi Arabia?   I'm sure that the $2 billion is seen as little more than an investment opportunity, and I'm sure the Saudis have researched the long history of success Trump businesses have had over the years and have decided to invest accordingly......\n\nNothing to see here, move along....",

            "comment": "***Analysis by Aaron Blake: Trump\u2019s defenders have debuted a remarkable defense of the former president. It both obviates a key distinction in the law and relies on a very dicey assumption.***\n\nDonald Trump was charged under the Espionage Act. Donald Trump was not charged with espionage.\r  \n\r  \nBut almost immediately upon his indictment late last week, key Trump defenders have sought to obviate this distinction in the service of arguing that there\u2019s not much to see here.\r  \n\r  \nWhile in some cases acknowledging that perhaps Trump did something wrong, they have argued that at least there\u2019s no evidence he gave these documents to America\u2019s enemies. They\u2019ve also effectively suggested that, absent such a breach, it\u2019s time to move on since the documents have been recovered.\r  \n\r  \nThe former is a remarkable feat of goalpost-setting and spin. The latter is a dicey assumption, given all that we\u2019ve learned.\r  \n\r  \nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board got the ball rolling on this argument Friday, within hours of the indictment being unsealed.\n\n\u201cHowever cavalier he was with classified files, Mr. Trump did not accept a bribe or betray secrets to Russia,\u201d it wrote Friday night. \u201cThe FBI recovered the missing documents when it raided Mar-a-Lago, so presumably there are no more secret attack plans for Mr. Trump to show off.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) later approvingly promoted this quote on Twitter.\r  \n\r  \nFox News host Mark Levin was also quick to this line of argument: \u201cThere\u2019s not one syllable of evidence in here, that any information under the Espionage Act was passed to any spies, to any enemies, to any foreign countries \u2014 not one.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) picked up the argument Sunday. \u201cEspionage charges are absolutely ridiculous. Whether you like Trump or not, he did not commit espionage,\u201d Graham said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHe did not disseminate, leak or provide information to a foreign power or to a news organization to damage this country. He is not a spy. He\u2019s overcharged.\u201d\n\nBut as Graham \u2014 a former Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps (JAG) lawyer \u2014 very likely knows, being charged under the Espionage Act does not mean you are accused of spying or even aiding spies. We flagged this Thursday after news broke that Trump was indicted but before the charges were unsealed Friday.\n\n**Read more or skip the paywall with email registration: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/12/trump-indictment-defense-espionage/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_source=reddit.com**",

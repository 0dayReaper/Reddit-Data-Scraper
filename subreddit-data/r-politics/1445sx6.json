I know that not all Republicans are from those districts or areas, but that is the breeding ground for the MAGA ideas and the MAGA ideas ARE the Republican Platform.

Then came along Trump and he appealed to them in a way that no previous person had because he yelled at the world like they did, he said all the right things and didn\u2019t seem overly educated while doing it, and he confirmed all their biases about the federal government every time someone tried to stop him from doing what he was doing.  He also already appeared to be wildly successful because this group of people can\u2019t tell the difference between a person with a bunch of stuff and a billionaire and a billionaire MUST know what they are talking about to have gotten where they were.\n\nThey didn\u2019t see the con because they didn\u2019t care they were being conned, grifting is just shrewd business and \u201call politicians pad their own pocket\u201d.  Most con artists are successful by telling people what they already want to be true, this one is no different. They aren\u2019t going to stop wanting to hear what he is telling them and he is definitely not going to stop telling them.  So then an entire landscape of people saying the same BS sprung up doing the same schtick and you have the current Republican Party.",

Trump initially having the documents is not why these charges are coming.  Trump The Master went all-out like some kind of white collar crime triathlete in bringing fucking espionage act charges down on his head because he:\n\nStole a bunch of financially valuable documents with major diplomatic and national security implications on his way out the door when he left office.\n\nLied and said he didn't have them, very presidentially [tried to force his lawyer to lie to the government](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/10/donald-trump-alex-cannon-classified-documents) about it too.\n\nPut an empty [classified folder in a display in a bar at Trump Tower](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/empty-classified-folder-display-trump-155058260.html) because that's the level of impulse control Trump The 4D Chess Master has.\n\n[Refused to give them back](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/us/politics/trump-documents-lawyers.html) when he couldn't legally deny that he obviously did have them.\n\nGave some back, lied and said that was all of them, [very masterfully adding to his crime Jenga tower by having his lawyer submit a signed document](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-lawyer-june-said-classified-material-had-been-returned-ny-times-2022-08-13/) to that effect.\n\nWas [caught on tape bragging about them to others](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-caught-tape-admitting-kept-classified-docs-1234745045/), and that he knew they were still classified. (Though it's important to note that classification isn't part of the charge, that doesn't figure into the wording of the law.  It's that he illegally made off with documents that could be harmful to national security and refused to surrender them).\n\nGot raided by the FBI when all negotiations failed.  Warned of 'reprisals' on his dollar store Twitter clone, which convinced one of [his less mentally stable followers to get himself killed attacking FBI headquarters in Cincinnati](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-office-shooting-suspect-killed-eb85e9faa93612fc54fb15639075d0fe) in retaliation.\n\nCaptain Law n' Order has since [spread a constant font of lies about the FBI](https://presswatchers.org/2022/08/the-phrase-youre-looking-for-is-stochastic-terrorism/) purely for public messaging gain.  He's using his political apparatus (including good ol' senator Hawley here) to attack law enforcement and undermine faith in the law.  Even after Jan. 6th, he's putting law enforcement agents in direct danger, basically because he can't give up his \"love letters\" from Kim Jong Un.\n\nAnd after all that is probably still hiding what happened to military or kompromat-related documents, as his lawyers now say the one he was on tape bragging about related to Iran invasion plans [has 'disappeared.'](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/us/politics/classified-documents-trump-recording.html)\n\n...meanwhile [Biden, unprompted, had his people search his own premises for docs, and returned them](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/biden-home-search-classified-documents-department-justice-1.6722258) even though he's in office *now* and should therefore be immune to anything and everything according to MAGAworld.  He cooperated with the FBI when they came searching for any left over.  If Trump wasn't so focused on scoring own-goals and quadrupling down on his mistakes to look \"alpha\" and had just handed all this stuff back, we would never have even heard about it.  I guarantee the FBI has plenty of less stressful stuff they'd rather be spending the time, money &amp; manpower on.\n\nI'm sure I forgot a ton of nonsense, but it's hard to keep up with a guy who works full-time at digging his own holes.",

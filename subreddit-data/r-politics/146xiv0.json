            "comment": "\"The key difference between the legal situations of Mr. Biden and Mr. Pence and that of Mr. Trump is not politics. Rather, the difference lies in what they did once they discovered the classified materials: Mr. Biden and Mr. Pence immediately notified the federal government, turned over the documents, and fully consented to thorough F.B.I. searches of their personal offices and residences. They did not willfully retain documents that they knew they had no legal right to keep, and they certainly did not undertake elaborate schemes to mislead their own lawyers or the government in order to conceal and hold the documents. The special counsel working on Mr. Biden\u2019s case has not yet announced whether he will pursue charges, but the Justice Department has closed the case against Mr. Pence, announcing just days before the Trump indictment was filed that no criminal charges will be sought.\n\nWhat about Hillary Clinton? Mrs. Clinton was the subject of chants at Trump rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign after it came to light that she had sent and received classified information on a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Unlike Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton had the right to see the documents in question; she was in office at the time and was cleared to see the most sensitive classified materials. The concern instead was that she had made classified information vulnerable by sharing it over an unclassified server and then deleted thousands of emails in what some saw as an attempted cover-up.\"\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/11/opinion/donald-trump-and-reality-winner-espionage-act.html?unlocked_article_code=g4eaAkKvmiYLN6D5YIGXWra4XESbbqwJOrKkBSIUU3JnPI33OGUX85gxt6Xgz6qEIBPcj4MeF3ADbcsWgz_RC25S6NNfmY_o5S_HwZxeYLAelou0f37kbYuM4LXzzQbMn2kLjrmBtezPpOmBZQWUDjUt6peQjxiM023vXrRmfi8TbVeCbq_XJ5hhnm0GN-WSlIcHXzV5jN0wRs4_1rA3eUrxWkTBnQuMaGWbebuBD7LqIZF-j-UsWDkl_N8LolVh-hLNIgm_G0nGt60dDOthGjV8yqMy2QdiBr1cTgigsE10WDrngiHowrE9rAOyWIkhCpaZNunGVOxoceLixhTpuSF4jJYdDc-nPyRZp8WVku34oqHWVG_6&amp;smid=url-share",

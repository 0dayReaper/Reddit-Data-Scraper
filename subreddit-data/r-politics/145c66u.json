Trump directed Nauta to remove at least 34 boxes (note: 64 moved from storage, 30 moved to storage) of documents from the storage room without knowledge of the attorney. (Texts suggest Trump intended to take some of the removed documents or boxes with him to The Bedminster Club.) This led to false certification of a thorough search by the attorney.\n* **Stories that show intent and knowledge:** Trump was involved with packing boxes in the White House, Trump hinted with a hand gesture and suggestive anecdote that his attorney should conceal classified documents that were found; Trump said the documents were classified as he showed them to people without clearance\n* **Stories of mishandling:** the boxes of documents had been moved from place to place (including to a ballroom and to his summer residence The Bedminster Club); storage room boxes fell over spilling classified documents out on the floor.",

Nothing else can remove them from the court.  Pitchforks are the only penalty they could possibly face, and everyone else loses if they do (given the history of popular uprisings).  Thomas has violated every aspect of ethics in the things already reported about him.  Alito is corrupt and has enriched himself with insider information in violation of both ethics and the law.  Neither cares for either the law or the Constitution when it\u2019s inconvenient for their preferred outcome.  They just make stuff up to justify making their personal views public policy.\n\nPersonally, I hope for their death by natural causes (aneurysm is quick, unpredictable, and lethal) or act of god (meteor?) as soon as possible.  Preferably within the next few months.",

They are required by law to file accurate financial disclosures on an annual basis.  Failing to file is a violation, and filing false statements is a crime.\n\nThomas has committed the second since 2012 or 2014(?) when he stopped reporting Crow\u2019s gifts.  There is a zero chance that the judicial ethics board would have told him to stop disclosing such gifts.  While Scalia might have suggested it (i.e. the colleague), he was not an ethics expert, and would have been providing a justification rather than an analysis.  Unless Thomas is so stupid that he is grossly unfit for the Court, he should know the difference and have known the proper escalation path for ethics questions.\n\nAlito has been trading on insider information in stocks related to matters before the Court.  That was revealed years ago.  However, both the lack of an enforceable ethics policy for the Court and the inherent difficulty in proving insider trading have inhibited investigation or prosecution.\n\nThey both committed crimes, but believe themselves above punishment and even criticism.",

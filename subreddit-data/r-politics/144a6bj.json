I'm sure there is a name for this kind of fallacy in statistics, but it would be on part with whether or not the groundhog sees its shadow as an accurate predictor of spring.\n\nAlso, Wisconsin has only gone for the winning President 4 of 6 times in the last elections so the local county results is somewhat meaningless when the collective dilutes their votes.\n\nEven more, in any of those elections, only one was decided of a margin of less than one Wisconsin in terms of electoral votes. That was 2000 where Bush won but Wisconsin went for the other guy anyway- so that did a whole lot of nothing for the results anyway.\n\nYou may still want to call it a bellwether, but others may call it irrelevant.",

You're speaking about them as they're used on Election Night when the votes are cast and the work of campaigning is done, and election wonks just have fun seeing who can come up with the most obscure county that has the strongest correlation to election results: \"no, no, there's this county of 100 people up in the Appalachian Mountains who all meet at the schoolyard at 8am for a flag football game to see who gets to cast their votes first at the town post office/church/fire station over an Appalachian potluck breakfast. It's weird, but I'm telling you, they've been right since 1928 so whoever they pick is going to win!\"\n\nBut every other day of the year, the swings of a bellwether county are important.  It's not random or a myth like Groundhog Day.  Nothing in elections is.  Elections are about trends and patterns based on population demographics and these bellwethers swing because their various demographics are a microcosm of the state/country.  Campaigns and election wonks look at them all together as focus groups for the temperature of the country when strategizing and forecasting, not to say \"whoever wins this county will win the election\", but \"this is how these people are feeling and similar people around the country likely feel similarly.\"\n\nThis is all in the article, by the way.

Then the 2020 Census found the area\u2019s modest Hispanic population had climbed by almost 70 percent over the previous 10 years, a figure Delchambre suspects is an undercount.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep up with everyone moving here anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nThe influx of job seekers from Mexico and other Latin American countries, she thinks, could help ease what officials say is one of the area\u2019s most urgent problems: a labor shortage so severe that a coffee shop, convenience store and gym in her area, among other establishments, are prone to closing early.\n\nSome of her neighbors, however, say they perceive migrants as lawbreakers who could be dangerous. When worries about \u201cthe border\u201d come up, people aren\u2019t talking about the boundary just north with Canada.\n\nThe discussions are playing out in region where the stark political split offers a telling gauge of the national mood: Situated in what is expected to be a key 2024 battleground state, Door is one of nine counties across the country that has backed the presidential winner in every election since 2000.\n\n\u201cWe voted for Bush twice, Obama twice, the other guy and Joe Biden \u2014 hopefully Joe Biden twice,\u201d Kris Sadur, chair of the Door County Democrats, said at a May pie-auction fundraiser, prompting chuckles. \u201cAll eyes are on Wisconsin, and it\u2019s a very exciting time to be in Door County.\u201d\n\nIn interviews this spring, 18 months before the 2024 election, residents across the political spectrum said they harbored doubts about the front-runners. Democrats expressed concerns about President Biden\u2019s age and his handling of the rising prices of everyday goods. Republicans, irked by former president Donald Trump\u2019s erratic behavior, said they desired a more even-keeled candidate.\r  \n\r  \nThese sentiments squared with the latest national survey from Marquette Law School, which found that although Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) had slight leads over Biden, more Americans held negative than positive views of all three candidates, and most Democrats said they didn\u2019t want to see Biden run again.\r  \n\r  \nWhile lukewarm about the candidates, Door County residents were animated by issues closer to home \u2014 a persistent labor shortage, an affordable-housing crunch and demographic change in this community of about 30,000. Conservatives said inflation and border security have worsened under Biden, asserting that unvetted outsiders could bring drugs and violence. Liberals said the administration hasn\u2019t done enough to create legal pathways for migrants to work in the United States, stifling opportunity and industry.\r  \n\r  \nThe tensions brewing here reflect a broader national debate on how the United States should address its overwhelmed immigration system, especially at a time when there are nearly twice as many open jobs as unemployed people looking for work.\n\n**How many times has your county picked the winner of the presidential election?**\r  \n**Find out here.

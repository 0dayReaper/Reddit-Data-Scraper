Trump ran for president with a \u201clock her up\u201d slogan, won the presidency, he hired his cronies that could have arrested her for her countless \u201ccrimes,\u201d they found nothing, next election comes up, and he repeats the same garbage for his next opponent. If they had ANYTHING of value, Biden would have been in prison by now. Instead, through a series of strange coincidences and corruption (lol), hard drives magically got lost by UPS and witnesses disappeared prior to testifying. It\u2019s a joke. A really scary joke that is destroying our country.",

Hmmm?  Was he just impotent?\n\nOr ... maybe just maybe ... it's the fact that the DOJ doesn't work that way?",

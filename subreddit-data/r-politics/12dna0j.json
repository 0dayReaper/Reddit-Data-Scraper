Evil only has to win a few times, sometimes only once. It can use anything and everything at its disposal, and it isn't bound by morals or ethics.  Good however has to win almost every time, and it's hampered by morals for what it can do.\n\nI think this is why superhero movies capture our attention so much. It has this dynamic, where villains can do anything but heroes have limitations. And we want to see how the hero still manages to win. \n\nI don't know if there's a way around this. I think Republicans have fallen so far that this is now the conflict we're in too.",

Under that specific definition, sexual relations \noccurs \"when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact \nwith the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or \nbuttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the \nsexual desire of any person.'' Thus, the President \ndenied engaging in or causing contact with the genitalia, \nbreasts, or anus of \"any person'' with an intent to arouse or \ngratify the sexual desire of \"any person.''   \n   \nBut the definition used by Starr and his team, Clinton receiving a blowie did not meet to their definition of \"sexual relations.\" If he was touched in those areas, but didn't touch those areas of any person, it wasn't \"sexual relations.\" By. Their. Definition.   \n  \nThat's it. That's the \"perjury.\" They asked him if he had sexual relations with Lewinsky, went on to define it in a way that gave him an out, then impeached him for telling the truth within the confines of Starr's definition of the term.",

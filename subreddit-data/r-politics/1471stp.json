Theyve already removed the possibility of a delay due to a venue change request TO Florida by the trump team *and* probably already defanged the judge by picking the one everyone\u2019s going to second guess to begin with. Fucking genius.\n\nSo they\u2019ve traded a guaranteed venue change fight and got at *worst* a possible fight, and one that can only lead to a more friendly court.",

There is no history, practice, or provision in law for presidents to take official records with them when they leave office to sort through, such as for a two-year period as described in some reports. If a former President or Vice President finds Presidential records among personal materials, he or she is expected to contact NARA in a timely manner to secure the transfer of those Presidential records to NARA. \n\n(Source: [https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2023/nr23-016](https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2023/nr23-016))",

If you return it as soon as you realize it and you cooperate with any investigation, then chances are you'll get a warning to be more careful. If your mistake was egregious, you might lose your clearance to look at classified materials and thus lose your job, but you won't wind up in prison.\n\nBiden and Pence are good examples of what you should do. They both found classified material that they shouldn't have had. They reported it to NARA/the FBI, turned over the documents, and allowed for searches to make sure nothing else was there. Mistakes happen and cooperation when you realize you made a mistake is the important thing.\n\nWith Trump, though, there was no cooperation. In fact, there's proof that he tried to hide the documents so that the government couldn't get them back. He was given every chance to comply. Had Trump turned everything back to NARA, this indictment wouldn't have happened. Instead, he turned some over, tried to hide others, claimed that he didn't have any, and - after boxes were seized - tried to argue in court that those were his property and needed to be returned to him.",

Let\u2019s not pretend as if it\u2019s a mystery whether she will; her name is already synonymous with MAGA-style judicial corruption.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The simplest way to put it is that if Cannon remains assigned to this case, Trump will NOT be convicted, no matter how damning the evidence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That conclusion is not defeatist or cynical; it is a mere acknowledgment of the reality that Republicans have created by stacking the bench with venal mediocrities like Aileen Cannon.\n\n[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/06/aileen-cannon-federal-prosecution-donald-trump.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/06/aileen-cannon-federal-prosecution-donald-trump.html)\n\n**EDIT**: *This is a Repeat posting of a reply as the original is reported to have been possibly mistakenly removed by a bot or mod.*",

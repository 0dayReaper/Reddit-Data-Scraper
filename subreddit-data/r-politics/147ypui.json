Interstate rail with stations in these small towns that would allow for tourism? Broadband internet actually supplied to small towns to allow people working from home?\n\nRipping up public transit, shitting on rail, and going all in on the extremely wasteful transit sector that is air travel (I'm not saying it shouldn't exist, but it should not be the defacto travel method - it should be vastly scaled down) is what *turned* these states into \"flyover country\".\n\nThere's so much to see and which could be there, but these people are being choked out by the very scumbags they turn out to vote for. And then they turn around and blame the left for their manufacturing dying, for production leaving, for the total lack of opportunity, for the cratering education system.\n\nSo if someone wants to take offense, they should consider that maybe they're getting mad about a term they helped coin.\n\nAnd especially considering the dehumanizing rhetoric and policies of the GOP targeting the trans community, I think I'll hold off on worrying too much about if someone gets salty about \"flyover country\" - especially when those low-population states get *more* fucking representation in our government than populous ones do, only to fuck themselves over with that disproportionate representation.\n\nNow I'm not one to victim blame, these people are getting fucked by propaganda preying on them from the very people screwing them (and everyone else). But they gotta wake the hell up and realizing that this MAGA shit sure ain't about to revitalize their dying towns.",

No, I don't think it's a bad idea to have children earn money by helping out, especially with a family business like a farm or corner store. As you said, it fosters a good work ethic, and allows them to go forward with the knowledge that a day's work will net a day's pay (of course in the case of a 12 yo you're getting like 3hrs tops). I don't think we need additional laws or anything rash, we just need to address these situations individually and decide what is appropriate.",

Nearly 130,000 unaccompanied migrant children arrived at the U.S. border in 2022 alone, many fleeing poverty and violence (Dreier and Luce 2023). Many are eligible for asylum protection but have ended up among the 1.6 million people caught up in a record-high backlog of asylum claims awaiting processing or hearing dates, with claims taking years to adjudicate (TRAC 2022). In the meantime, many unaccompanied minors are sent to live with relatives or other sponsors. Both youth and adults awaiting asylum claims processing are ineligible for work permits for many months and cannot access social safety net programs (Workie, Hinkle, and Heredia 2022), leaving them impoverished and desperate to accept work of any kind to pay for necessities like food and rent, as well as repay debts to sponsors or help support family members in their countries of origin. Until federal agencies address the asylum backlog and the downstream issues it creates, young migrant children will continue to be a pool of potential workers whom employers may exploit, knowing they have no other viable options.\n\n[source](https://www.epi.org/publication/child-labor-laws-under-attack/)",

And especially with family farms that are passed on generationally, it can be very specific to the land itself. For ex. how corn grows on the back acre is a specific knowledge known only to family who has farmed there. And all this is often interwoven with family histories and storytelling, almost an oral tradition of the intersection of land, family, and business. It can be quite unique to every family and property.\n\nAll that said, my first job was on a tobacco farm at 10 years old. I drove my grandpa\u2019s tractor that was about 60 years old at the time. I set tobacco, topped tobacco, picked horn worms off tobacco, and stripped tobacco\u2014 my little kid hands caked in tobacco tar so much so that my fingers stuck together. I learned a lot, worked hard, it\u2019s a story to tell that many of my geriatric millennial generation hasn\u2019t ever heard. But I also don\u2019t think a 10 year old should have had their hands coated in tobacco tar absorbing nicotine and all the various chemicals in it.",

There is a difference, I am all for safety laws but if kids wanna work for a few hours after school then let them. I am 17 now and I started working at 15 (part time).

Kids can\u2019t learn to code from a parent just like work a field?   Farming is dangerous as just about any factory or maybe even more so depending on the job.  Which is the point of this article.  Why does AG get a pass on safety?   Having kids to help run the family farm sucks for those kids that don\u2019t want to farm.  \n\nFor instance \n\n&gt; And while children are generally prohibited from doing hazardous work in other sectors, there's an exception for agriculture. At 16, children can operate heavy machinery and perform tasks at any height while working on a farm without any protections against falling, unlike in other industries\n\nWhy the free pass for AG?",

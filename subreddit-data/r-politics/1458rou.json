Truly one of the most depressing things I've ever seen in politics is that after four years of Trump, more people voted for him than before. I understand that the vote count for Biden as well as the overall count too was high too but even if Trump becomes a nonfactor for running again I still think there is the very real fear over how many people either actively supported him or passively tolerated him because R next to his name. There are some business owners I know that claimed they wanted to fly out and be there on Jan 6, that's how far down the crazy and conspiracy rabbit hole they are. They're rarer than other types of R in my area of Florida but nonetheless there are still too many people drinking the Trump flavor-aid even when his strongman persona was dented by the election loss. They just accepted the deep state interference denial so it really feels like there is *nothing* he could do to lose their support. There have been journalists interviewing people that show that same vehement and unwavering support practically only growing as he becomes more reprehensible and perhaps those supporters getting isolated even more from their friends and family for the blatant stubbornness and insanity they are showing.\n\n===\n\nIn short, even if Trump is in jail or dead at some point, the specter of MAGA and neo-fascism looms and I imagine it will continue to unless R's just face repeated loss after loss for catering to them.",

When he got to his car, someone pointed out that there was a case of coke on the bottom of the cart he forgot to pay for.  He immediately went back to the store, gave them the case back, and let them check his shopping to make sure he paid for everything else.\n\n- Trump walked out of the store with a 80\" flat-screen TV.  When folks told him that he didn't pay for it, he said that he already owned the TV and didn't need to pay.  When they demanded he give it back, he gave them the remote and the power cable, claiming that was all he had.  His home is then searched, showing he took a bunch of other electronics too.  Recordings came out where he brags about the fact he knew he stole it.\n\nIn both scenarios, the individual \"stole\" but that is where the similarities end.",

They did this because the at-the-time president's son-in-law seemed like a real cool dude, so they opted to not entrust their money with any other person who might have experience and/or success in investing and who would also verh likely provide more guarantees regarding the competent oversight of their money than Jared did.\n\nI don't even know if the Saudi's have to provide an \"official\" reason, but this is rank corruption plain as daylight in my eyes.",

            "comment": "What's so pathetic about this is that Trump shared classified military intelligence with some authors writing a puff piece about Mark Meadows, all because he was butthurt at how the media portrayed Gen. Milley (who Trump appointed). He was upset that Milley was seen as smart and steady, while he was seen as an insurrectionist, which he is. So, he wanted to try and convince the Meadows book authors that Milley was a warmonger because he and the DoD drew up tentative plans in case the US ever needed to attack Iran (a situation Trump started and escalated). \n\nThis is a textbook illustration of why Trump never should have had any access to classified intel and was/is completely unfit for office. Any Russian or Chinese spy could easily manipulate him into sharing classified intel at any point just by appealing to Trump's fragile baby ego. \n\nIn fact, we know Trump has already done just that, when he had Russian spies in his office the day after he fired Comey and throughout his adminstration's interactions with the Saudi Crown Prince. \n\nI genuinely think this is just the tip of the iceberg. If Trump shared that info so cavalierly, I would bet a month's salary that Trump sold state secrets to the Saudis or worse, the Russians, and it will eventually come out in this case.\n\nEdit: Oh look, I wasn't far off. About an hour after I posted this, the indictment shows that Trump revealed the US military's plans of attack on a foreign country, and how we would defend ourselves against a foreign attack to the authors and to an employee of his PAC just for shits.",

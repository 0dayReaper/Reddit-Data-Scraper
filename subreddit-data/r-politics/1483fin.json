IF they can demonstrate this to a reasonable degree, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this change in rule is necessary.\n\nWhile the argument that a rifle with a 12 in barrel is more concealable than one with an 16 in barrel is \"technically\" true, it is not based in reality or real-life scenarios. Even with a barrel as short as 8 in, they are still bulky weapons and not at all easy to carry discreetly while at the same time being as practical as a 3 in subcompact handgun.",

The ATF approved said device.\n\nOver the years, that device has changed shape gradually, and now looks almost exactly like a butt stock with velcro straps.  Like this\n\nhttps://www.sb-tactical.com/product/sba4/\n\nThe ATF was in a bad position because the approved the original device, and got caught up flip flopping on their decisions about the device.\n\nMillions of people exploited this and used the 'brace' to skate the short-barrel rifle rules of the NFA passed in 1934.  Including myself.  That brace even extends and collapses like a butt stock.\n\nSee that picture in the link?  Because the AR15 in the picture has a short barrel and \"Doesnt have a butt stock\" it previously classified as a \"pistol with a handicapped device\"  But we all know its really a short barrel rifle on the bleeding edge of legality\n\nThey are not JUST exploiting the brace device.  They are exploiting the poor job of wording that the NFA used to describe whats a rifle or a pistol.  This is a very common way to skirt gun control laws.\n\nPoint in case, my CZ came with a brace made of rubber so hard, I can't even get it around my forearm, and Im a skinny dude.  It can't even function as a brace.\n\nThey simply fixed the exploit.\n\nThere wouldnt have been so much outrage if the ATF didnt make this series of mistakes.  But since they did, the changes are taking options away from people.  You know how they feel about that.\n\nPersonally, I am not outraged.  It sucks, but I saw this coming like 3 years ago.  We all knew what we were doing.",

I believe much could have been prevented had the ATF not changed positions so many times. Even their Director went in front of congress and said that simply removing the brace and storing it separately would be enough to be in compliance; this is very different than what is published on their own website. I'm all for gun control, but it needs to also make sense. Removing a pistol brace from a weapon does not alter its functionality at all. Take a look at this example [Brace vs non-Brace](https://images.guns.com/wordpress/2013/05/SB15-Pistol-Stabilizing-Brace.jpg) \\- The \"business end\" remains exactly he same with the same capability.",

It's less deadly then a rifle that uses larger rounds with more gun powder and a longer barrel to increase pressure and maintain higher power on the way out. \n\nThese guns aren't used for mass shooting because they are expensive and no better then a regular pistol outside of less recoil. A ln actual rifle is still cheaper than this.",

They won't show up to vote for someone else. They might go and write in Trump's name, but even that might be a stretch. Meanwhile, the GOP's embrace of Trump has pushed a lot of people away. I don't think another candidate is going to be the salve that brings enough of those people back to put things at a pre-2016 status quo in which elections can swing based on independents and such. The GOP has gone so far to the right that they need the Trump-or-nobody vote to turn out if they want a chance in hell. Christie, Pence, DeSantis... none of these guys will capture the sycophants, and they need those people.\n  \nIt should go without saying that we all need to do out damnedest and vote in every election at every level to remove the GOP from any semblance of power. We cannot be complacent when facing an existential threat.  But Trump has created a tricky situation for the GOP, trickier than I think many realize.",

Christie, if you remember back in 2016, is credited for tanking Rubio's presidential hopes by aggressively attacking him in one of the debates, right when Rubio's star was beginning to rise.  This was great for Trump, as it took Rubio out of the running, but it did neither Christie, Rubio or the Republican Party as a whole any favors.  \n\nChristie has no hope of winning the election if he targets Trump, this isn't really helping him go up in the polls, but if he hits Trump hard enough he could cause Trump some serious damage.  A Republican Party could use someone like Christie to muscle Trump out while keeping the blowback on Christie instead of the Republican party, but Christie, and Republicans, in general, aren't the kind of people that \"take one for the team\".",

This is a problem is DeSantis's own making, but it's still a problem he has to solve somehow. This is one potential solution, and it's not the worst argument he could make.",

So it doesn't particularly matter how much evidence you show them, it's all dismissed because it doesn't fit with the groupthink, with marching orders issued daily through the RW media's fear machine of outrage porn.\n\nVlad Vexler talks about [how Germans felt after WW2,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4O3D7CfThA&amp;t=261s) and it apparently took until the 1960s for the majority of Germans to stop thinking they didn't start the war. 7 years after hostilities ceased, a 1952 poll showed 68% still thought *other countries* started it. Nearly half said \"yes\" to the proposition that \"were it not for the war, Hitler would've been one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century\", implying the war was forced upon him and Germany. The indoctrination was incredibly pervasive and it took decades to deprogram the population, even with a full-on occupation and forced capitulation by foreign powers.\n\nI've seen some progress made towards deprogramming with street epistemology, basically making them question *why* they believe what they believe, before they can put up their wall of defenses. But unfortunately I'd suspect too many will go to their graves before departing from the cult. The indoctrination is that entrenched and deep-seated.",

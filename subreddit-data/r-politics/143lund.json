            "comment": "All the evidence points to Trump knowingly and intentionally STEALING these documents. Him \"jerking around the DOJ\" sounds like he accidently took some stuff and was being difficult about giving it back. It's much, much worse than that. Even without the speculation that he intended to sell or leverage this info (which is highly likely), his knowledge and admission that the documents were both classified and that he wasn't entitled to have them belie his intent in taking them, hiding them, and refusing to give them back. \n\nThis is US property he brazenly stole and dared Biden's administration to do anything about. His hubris led him to believe his status as an EX-President (and the media's penchant for giving his lies veracity) would shield him from repercussions. So far he's been correct, but we're waiting on pins and needles for that to change.",

Most rich people can get away behaving poorly, but most manage to at least fake having a presentable reputation.  Trump figured out a long time ago, a bad reputation is just as valuable as a good reputation.  As long as he gets talked about and has a sizable reputation, he can leverage his notoriety.",

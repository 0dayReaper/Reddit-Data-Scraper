Religion is a pestilence in it\u2019s own sense with how we as humans use it, every civilization has these weaknesses and pestilences such as greed and resistance to change and cultural and societal conditions that culminate into the human trap and leaves us with misery. We live in a country that has so many injustices and violations across the board that getting into all of them right now would probably require a books worth of text, but they culminate in this anti human and anti nature condition we see now. It may sound religious, but it\u2019s just a  short phrase that I feel gets my message across without having to resort to word walls like this one.",

Personally, I think a Speaker vote would be over a lot sooner than this \"We're stalling everything! Hold the Floor\" nonsense.\n\nThere is no realistic alternative to McCarthy. Jordan and Scalise are close, but neither of them is stupid enough to take the job. So after so many votes--10, 20, however many--we'd welcome the original House Speaker back to the floor.\n\nStalling everything, though, is a perennial. It won't end until they feel they've sufficiently punished McCarthy, which could be anytime from four weeks from now to the 2024 election.\n\nIt's a perfectly effective little strategy on their part.",

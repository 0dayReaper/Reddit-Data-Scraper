As we know, the moon moves across the Earth East to West, and then West to East, each day.  The fish smell the delicious moon as it travels, and they swim towards it, trying to get a taste.  Their tails flap as they swim, which pushes the water in the opposite direction.  Eventually some of that water ends up on the beach ruining your sand castle.  The best solution is to make a cheese castle so that fish will swim towards your beach and the water flows away from it.",

What the motion to dismiss actually says is that \u201cAnalyzed under these factors, and even assuming, arguendo, that each of the statements alleged in the Complaint could be proved true or false, no reasonable person would\nconclude that the statements were truly statements of fact\u201d. In other words the motion is saying that what Sidney Powell is saying is her opinion versus being an objective statement of fact. It\u2019s not saying she doesn\u2019t believe what she\u2019s saying is true, it\u2019s saying she\u2019s expressing an opinion versus claiming something is an undeniable fact. It\u2019s a pretty common motion in defamation cases, claiming that the defendant was only expressing an opinion and not \u201cstating a fact\u201d since defamation doesn\u2019t apply to opinions.\n\nOf course this motion is still a bunch of hot garbage. Sidney Powell literally claimed that she had evidence showing what she said about Dominion is true and even filed legal motions claiming it was objectively true, so the notion that what she said was \u201cjust an opinion\u201d is farcical. But it\u2019s important to understand her lawyers aren\u2019t arguing that she lied, they\u2019re arguing she was stating a subjective opinion.\n\nLegal Eagle did a fun piece on this other day, that channel is always a good watch. \ud83d\udc4d",

These are such important lawsuits since this bullshit now is the root of all of the republican voter suppression laws that are sure to dictate who wins future elections. The damage fox news did is pretty much immeasurable and I wish they could be held truly accountable for what they did to all of us. \n\nJust winging this but I wonder if the US government could work with Dominion to require fox to run, not just retractions, but to completely clear the air on what happened by, convincing their audience that vote by mail is trustworthy and accurate last year and in the future because of its simplistic design where counties issue a single copy to a single voter and then tracked through the whole process. They then need to report on what the republicans are doing for the sole purpose of suppressing votes. \n\nTheres no doubt, some republican voters will think cheating through any means possible will think this is a great tactic and take their, ha ha, fuck you attitude to the polls, but honorable decent voters can at least be informed of what's going on and make their decisions on who to vote for in the future accordingly based on the actual facts. Its an absolute crime what fox is allowed to do right now by spreading disinformation about our election process and somehow, some way, it must be stopped",

They would run around the 180 acres on all kinds of adventures and see and smell all kinds of domestic and wild animals. They always returned home, especially when hungry and there was never a problem with them running away. My cousin has a 140 acre farm in that same area now and she has a dog. For some reason she put up invisible fencing in her main yard for the dog. So she puts a collar on the dog and it gets a little jolt of electricity anytime it tries to cross the fence, so basically the dog is confined to that small area on the farm. The dog gets really excited when my cousin puts the collar on him because he knows that he is going outside.The dog perceives the collar as a good thing but in reality it is keeping the dog prisoner most of the farm and what it has to offer like chasing rabbits. \nThe people I grew up with in that small farming community are good people, but small town politics and boredom drove me away. In town every bar, restaurant, laundromat etc has Fox News on a television. The same group of guys sit around the biggest table in the cafe and disparage the libs every morning with a TV with Fox News on in the background. When visiting I will sit at the table and will hardly ever correct them even when they say something outlandish. Still however they humorously consider me citified. I however equate them with the dog that wears the collar, they see their little micro environment that Fox lays out for them and are oblivious to the real world.",

Realistically when I argue with the Fox News viewer I have to realize that no matter what else exists I am forced to show or prove it bc the little bit of information or lies they are given are usually only part of the full story. The Hunter Biden story where Joe comes in to save his son by firing the lawyer is the best example....they are convinced that Joe was only saving his son and that he is corrupt. But there is sooo much more truth and evidence to that story that they just don\u2019t believe.   \n\nSeriously Fox News and other radio/tv/internet stations have done more damage to our country\u2019s mindset with misinformation and half truths disguised as gospel that I\u2019m not sure we ever can come back from it. Maybe this lawsuit will lead to a better understanding on what is news and force a challenge to those who seek to mislead the public. But when looking at the extent of the damage done, I don\u2019t see how one small flashlight can illuminate an entire country.",

They live in a carefully curated bubble, and that bubble repeats to them all the time that they are independent free thinkers who _really_ know what's going on. And that everyone from school teachers to the CDC are lying to them, and everyone else is fooled. It's insidious and hard to break through.  \n\nBut it's more about trust than intelligence.  It doesn't matter how smart you are , or how able you are to investigate alternative points of view if you already have as part of your worldview the presupposition that \"alternative points of view\" are explicitly malicious lies.",

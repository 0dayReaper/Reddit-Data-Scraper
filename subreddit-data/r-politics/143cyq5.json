David Reimer presumably had XY chromosomes, so you would support classifying him as male and providing him with gender affirming care (in his case testosterone, since he did not naturally produce it due to medical mishap). Would you support doing the same thing for an individual who has XY chromosomes but develops female anatomy, such as those with Swyer syndrome? If yes, why do you oppose doing the same for someone who has XX chromosomes?",

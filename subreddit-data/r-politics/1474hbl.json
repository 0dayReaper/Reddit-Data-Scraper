This has resulted in a more than a 60% decrease in overall homelessness in just over a decade\u2026First, we decided to work together as a collaborative system, aligned around a standardized set of goals, processes and strategies, rather than as individual organizations and government entities each trying to chip away at the problem. Today, more than 100 entities in the Houston area are working together\u2026Second, we embraced the data-proven best practices of Housing First, a strategy focused on getting individuals and families out of homelessness and into permanent housing before helping them address any other problems. \n\n\nWow! I had no idea they were doing this. Amazing how much good we can do if we actually used data proven strategies to treat homelessness in a humane effective way. Always is ridiculous to think of how we could house the homeless and support them and treat them like a fellow human in need of support and resources, but only if we wanted to as a society. This has transformed so many lives and makes me happy and hopeful. I don\u2019t expect this to happen on a nationwide scale but hopefully more communities can take some notes and get to work to help house those in need.",

I don't think most people would choose to be helpless, it goes against our base needs of security in shelter. Once that can be stabilized, people can start working on other aspects that they need to improve or need help with. But if you are constantly worried about not having a roof over your head or moving around, it's hard to focus on anything else.",

It's due to mental health issues making them unemployable and often unstable. It is an incredibly harmful, stressful, and physically damaging life. It's never a choice. And for people with addictions or other issues, it's not about choice. If it were, they wouldn't be addictions. \n\nShelters also often have mixed issues making them dangerous for families or unavailable to men.due to perceived risk toward women and children residents. So some cases of not using shelters can be due to lack of availability.\n\nYou're repeating very harmfull myths that the evidence doesn't support.",

That argument is a little like the example that someone didn't choose to kill themself, they chose to jump out of an airplane without a chute.  To-mah-to, to-ma-to.\n\nMy question was about if some don't want help.  Believe it or not, some people don't.  If a choice was a simple \"do you want a free dwelling or not\" I bet almost all would want that.  But if it's do you want a free dwelling but you have to get a (probably crappy) job, get off drugs, get into therapy, attend religious services, go to bed early and wake up early etc. I would venture some wouldn't want it.  Notably because they ARE mentally ill which often leads to making poor life choices.  Also, around where I live there's a network of the homeless that help each other out.  At least that's my understanding.  I would imagine many feel a kinship of sorts.\n\n  I'm actually for paying higher taxes to help people out and I've long thought that this is cheaper than jail.  But can you answer those who believe otherwise is the question.  \n\nDid you know that during the great depression Republican's that didn't vote with Democrats to help people struggling used the slogan \"the liberty is worth the poverty\".  Those are the ever present \"pick yourself up by your bootstraps\" people.  And don't even get me started on the Prosperity Gospel.\n\nIn short, few rational people would choose harsh conditioned homelessness over a nice home.  But like my parachute example, life choices often aren't of the either or variety but happen by matters of degree and perspective.  I wouldn't flatter myself to think I could put myself in the shoes of someone living on the street.  But I would say that even if you've experienced homelessness that doesn't mean you have the universal homelessness experience down.  And while living week to week blowing every penny you have while figuring it's someone else's job to take care of you isn't exactly choosing to be homeless, it is a roadmap to it.  (No intention to offend, just sayin'.)",

It's really given me a first hand insight into how the authorities, particularly the police, treat homeless people here. I've been with him as the NYPD has surrounded and bullied him. He's almost 60 and has chronic heart and kidney problems, as well as severe back problems which make it hard for him to get around and move his stuff. They descend upon him in a big gang and surround him and bully him. They often do it in conjunction with the Sanitation Dept - they'll order the Sanitation to come and throw all of his possessions away. He keeps everything neat and clean and organized - they'll charge right up and start throwing his bags right in the garbage truck. Luggage bags full of warm clothes he needs. Bags full of food they claim is \"rancid\" but is really a huge box of brand new protein bars someone bought for him the day before. They'll hold and restrain him whilst a cop goes through his stuff saying \"you don't need this....this is garbage....you don't need this\" whilst tossing it to the Sanitation guys. He gets attacked at night by loons on the street, and if he calls the cops, they come and threaten to take him to a mental institute \"for lying again.\" He had cellphone footage of a guy attacking him with a pair of scissors, and when he called the cops they immediately came and threatened to arrest him for telling lies, even as he's showing them the footage. When I confronted the cops and asked what they get out of bullying him, they said \"someone in the neighborhood called 311 to make a complaint. We have to act on that complaint.\" So ONE PERSON calls 311 about a homeless guy, meanwhile when you have a *genuine* 311 complaint that requires police, the NYPD most usually don't even show up and then falsify the report form saying \"we attended the scene but didn't see a problem.\" Basically the authorities treat them like animals and it's disgusting.",

Houston has that because they let people build it.\n\nCalifornia on the other hand hasn't been able to replicate Houston's success, despite housing first policy being [state law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1380).\n\nIn 2016 for example voters in Los Angeles passed [Prop. HHH](https://controller.lacity.gov/audits/problems-and-progress-of-prop-hhh), which authorized $1.2 billion for new affordable housing. Five years later all the money had been spent and only 1,132 units were ready for occupancy, with 86% of units still under construction or in the early development stage. Average cost per unit was $600,000.\n\nHousing first only works if you have housing.",

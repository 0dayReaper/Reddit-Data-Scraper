It\u2019s attributing those words directly to Pritzker in order to avoid \u201ccreating a fact\u201d.  \n\nPritzkers statement refers to a generality not an event, so the quotes are warranted. \n\nHad the legislation been in response to an attack on a person/place/event/etc, then the quotes wouldn\u2019t necessarily be as there would have been \u201ca simple fact\u201d to which Pritzker was referring. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s a bold, strong, and very valid headline *because* they chose to quote Pritzker in it.",

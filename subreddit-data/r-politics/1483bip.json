It was MY paint that I bought and MY wall that I bought, so since you painted it does that mean I'm suddenly not allowed to sell it?",

Its not public information.\n\nIts perfectly legal because you give these companies permission to collect and sell your data to whoever they want in those user agreements you don't read and just hit accept on.  Hell, even without accepting user agreements, most sites (including Reddit) stipulate that merely using their site constitutes agreeing to have your data harvested.\n\nGo to legitimately any website on the entire internet, scroll to the bottom, there will inevitably be a little blurb about their 'Privacy Policy', click it, lo and behold...

The only one guaranteed to not want to cooperate is Trump himself, so he's going to end up being the fall guy for **EVERYTHING**. They have a Mount Everest of evidence just to make absolutely positively sure he goes away for a relatively small list of crimes while everyone else gets to walk away. And we won't even know more than a fraction of the information offered because the government is full of people who don't want to see their friends go to prison.",

He may enable hate that reminds us of Hitler's level, but there's a world of difference between the two of them as well.\n\nBasically, just watch out for MAGAs doing anything stupid.

Being the Governor of California didn't put much polish on his resume either.  An old, B-list movie star getting elected in La-La land didn't empress most people.  But, it didn't matter. The GOP shoved their greedy, power hungry hand up his ass and turned him into their puppet. They took his surface level affability and charisma, as well as his actual ability to speak well in public and follow a script, and turned that into the bogus conservative icon that the Republicans still slavishly revere. They built a cult of personality around him, the B-list actor played his part like he was told, and the conservatives fell in love with it.  Trump wasn't/isn't nearly as co-operative as Reagan was, but he still served relatively the same purpose.  Don't think that it can't happen again.",

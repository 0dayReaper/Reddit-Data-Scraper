Like a boxer in the ring, he brings everything he has to the immediate episode, fighting furiously to come out on top. But the episodes do not add up. They do not form a narrative arc. In ~~Trump\u2019s~~ Rubio's case, it is as if he wakes up each morning nearly oblivious to what happened the day before. *What he said and did yesterday, in order to win yesterday, no longer matters to him. And what he will do today, in order to win yesterday, no longer matters to him. And what he will do today, in order to win today, will not matter for tomorrow.*\" - [Op-Ed: The truth behind Trump's need to lie](https://news.yahoo.com/op-ed-truth-behind-trumps-100006025.html)",

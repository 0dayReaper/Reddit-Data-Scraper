They appear to be deployed on an as-needed basis at the discretion of the HHSC and Capitol Police.

Before the evidence pointed to Trump whipping up an angry crowd of idiots to 'do something'. It seems like another giant group of stupid angry Trump supporters acting stupid and angry. yeah they have cops on their side who are also stupid and sympathetic. Yeah, they are violent and imagined they would be taking hostages. But it never seemed like anyone intended for them to be actual occupiers of the capitol. In big part due to the fact that they all pretty much left the capitol willfully after they got tired of playing terrorist. They had no coordinated objectives. The cops let them in because they were overwhelmed and also because they are racists who cant see white people as threats. They brought zipties because they are larpers. They killed a cop because they are in a frenzy. The only thing that was coordinated was the loud angry rally beforehand. It seemed a gathering of lone wolves and loosely affiliated, poorly thought through, objectives. It didn't seem before that anyone expected they would actually be inside the capitol except in the protesters wildest dreams. \n\nNow it is undeniable that there was a planned occupation. There were plants in the crowd like this lady who were there (WITH A MEAGAPHONE) to direct them how to break in and where to go afterwards. That security was tampered with ahead of time. That a few congress people had helped them find targets presumably to murder. And that there were people behind the scenes coordinating messages across social media.",

Hitler's government stated that Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch council communist, was the culprit, and it attributed the fire to communist agitators. A German court decided later that year that Van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he had claimed. The day after the fire, the Reichstag Fire Decree was passed. The Nazi Party used the fire as a pretext to claim that communists were plotting against the German government, which made the fire pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany.\n  \nInterestingly enough,\n\n&gt;some historians believe, based on archive evidence, that the arson had been planned and ordered by the Nazis as a false flag operation.",

Because taking the panic button out *should* set off the alarm (intentionally, in case someone decides to just rip it out). \n\nFor a more geeky version of why, most of these types of buttons are contact closure buttons that are \"normally closed.\" So any disconnection of the button, even if you, say, just snipped the wires going to the button, would set the alarm off. You could tie the ends together to close the circuit again, but you wouldn't be able to do so without triggering the alarm.\n\nEdit: Since a lot of replies brought this up: With a typical contact closure, yes, shorting the wires further up the cable could theoretically keep the circuit closed while removing the button. However, depending on the security features of the alarm system, many of them are \"tamper-proof\" and are extremely sensitive to impedance changes for exactly that reason. So depending how advanced the system is that may or may not work.",

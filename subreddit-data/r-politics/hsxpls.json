            "comment": "Esper played his political hand well -  technically he did not ban the confederate flag outright, he outlined what flags are allowable.  There is no mention of the words \"Confederate Flag\" or \"Ban\" in the Memo.\n\nSource of memo: [https://news.usni.org/2020/07/17/secdef-esper-memo-on-displaying-flags-on-u-s-bases](https://news.usni.org/2020/07/17/secdef-esper-memo-on-displaying-flags-on-u-s-bases) \n\n \n\nSUBJECT: Public Display or Depiction of Flags in the Department of Defense\n\nThe mission of the Department of Defense is to provide a combat-ready  military force to deter conflict, and, should deterrence fail, to  prevail in war. Accomplishing this mission depends on our most important  resource \u2013 our Service members and civilian employees. Supporting our  people requires mutual respect, responsibility, and accountability.\n\nFlags are powerful symbols, particularly in the military community  for whom flags embody common mission, common histories, and the special,  timeless bond of warriors. As Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, a  veteran of the Second World War, once wrote about the United States  flag: \u201cIt is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious  tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our  aspirations.\u201d We wear this flag on our sleeves; we honor it prominently  on parade fields; we carry it into combat; and, we drape it over the  coffins of those who have given their lives for our Nation.\n\nWe must always remain focused on what unifies us: our sworn oath to  the Constitution and our shared duty to defend the Nation. I am  committed to fielding the most powerful military force the world has  known by strengthening the bonds of our most valuable resource -our\n\npeople. That is why we honor the American flag, which is the  principal flag we are authorized and encouraged to display. The flags we  fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and  discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and  rejecting divisive symbols.\n\nConsequently, in addition to the American flag, Service members and  civilian employees are authorized to display or depict representational  flags that promote unity and esprit de corps, including:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Flags of U.S. States and Territories and the District of Columbia; \n* Military Service flags;\n* Flag or General Officer flags;\n* Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian flags;\n* Senior Executive Service (SES) and Military Department-specific SES flags;\n* The POW /MIA flag;\n* Flags of other countries, for which the United States is an ally or partner, or for official protocol purposes;\n* Flags of organizations in which the United States is a member ( e.g., NATO); and\n* Ceremonial, command, unit, or branch flags or guidons.\n\nThis guidance applies to public displays or depictions of flags by  Service members and civilian employees in all Department of Defense work  places, common access areas, and public areas, including, but not  limited to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Office buildings, facilities, naval vessels, aircraft, government  vehicles, hangars, garages, ready rooms, conference rooms, individual  offices, cubicles, storage rooms, tool and equipment rooms, workshops,  break rooms, kitchens/galleys, recreational areas, commissaries, Navy  and Marine Corps and Army and Air Force exchanges, and  heads/latrines/restrooms \u2013 including property and buildings off  installation leased by the Department;\n* Sensitive compartmented information facilities and other secure facilities;\n* Open-bay barracks, berthing areas, and common areas of barracks and bachelor quarters;\n* School houses and training facilities; and\n* All spaces or items in public or plain view, such as the outside  areas of any Department of Defense buildings and government-operated or  public-private venture housing (e.g., parking lots, yards, gazebos, or  porches).\n\nThe public display or depiction of unauthorized flags in museum  exhibits, state-issued license plates, grave sites, memorial markers,  monuments, educational displays, historical displays, or works of art,  where the nature of the display or depiction cannot reasonably be viewed  as endorsement of the flag by the Department of Defense, is not  prohibited.\n\nWhat has always united us remains clear \u2013 our common mission, our  oath to support and defend the Constitution, and our American flag. With  this change in policy, we will further improve the morale, cohesion,  and readiness of the force in defense of our great Nation.\n\n(signed)\n\nMark Esper",

Ultimately, politicians arent patriotic enough to sacrifice themselves for the country, much less the president, if their name is on something they did. \n\n(Something they didn't do is another question entirely)",

I always just looked at it as a joke because it only existed for such a short time.\n\nThe *real* joke is that they claim it as their \"heritage\" when it only existed for 4 years. I just never got that aspect of the joke until reading how you wrote that. Thanks!",

The Maryland Campaign (culminating in the Battle of Antietam) was the first time the Confederacy invaded the North. Part of the Southern strategy here was to pressure the North into backing down, by way of a major victory on Northern soil. Furthermore, this would, the South hoped, force Britain to intercede and help the US broker as peace treaty.\n\nIn 1862, before the Maryland Campaign, British officials were discussing recognizing the CSA.\n\n\"*The Federals*,\" he (British Prime Minister Palmerston) told Russell (British Foreign Secretary), \"*got a very complete smashing, and it seems not altogether unlikely that still greater disasters await them, and that even Washington or Baltimore may fall into the hands of the Confederates. If this should happen, would it not be time for us to consider whether . . . England and France might not address the contending parties and recommend an arrangement upon the basis of separation*?\"\n\nSoon after this letter, they received news of Lee marching into Maryland. They waited until the Confederates would gain some major victories there, before they interceded.\n\nThe Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single day battle in American history, forced Lee to retreat back into Virginia. Immediately after this, Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, and this forever shut down any more talk of European intervention.",

Or as it\u2019s phrased...\n\n&gt; We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.",

The Union may have \"won\" the war in order to \"save the union\", but - just as we're realizing we did with the Cold War - did fuck-all to make sure that the rebels/traitors weren't planting seeds to maintain their cause and ideologies. \n\n*Unlike* with the Cold War, these were not secretive gardens, but as with your example, were done blatantly out in the open. From Confederate monuments erected long after the war's end, to educating newer generations to being almost entirely ignorant of the true nature and purpose of that war - eventually letting Texas bare responsibility for the subject matter and the printing of many of the country's textbooks.\n\nIt's just pathetically ironic that a country founded through violent rebellion did so little to ensure that after the end of a nation rending civil war, there were no embers remaining to stomp out any future fires of their rebellion. And it's not like they even put too much effort into smothering the embers, they just left them smouldering/smoking and kinda just walked away.",

Consider a young, African American woman who enlists out of patriotism, and a deep desire to serve and protect her nation's people, institutions, and way of life. She completes basic and is assigned to duties on a base named after a Confederate military leader.\n\nWhy should her noble decision to put herself in harm's way for the sake of the nation she loves, be *debased* and *disrespected* by requiring her to serve on a military installation named to honor a man who would regard her as *property*? Who did not hesitate to kill patriotic American servicemen by the thousands, to ensure that she *remained* \"property\"? Who picked up a rifle to defend the right of any man who claimed \"ownership\" of her, to sexually violate her? And who spent four long, violent years  in an extended act of *armed insurrection* against the nation of his birth - simply to assert that, because she had a dark complexion, she deserved to remain in chains until the end of her days?\n\nWhere exactly does the \"honor\" lie, in ordering that she must serve her country in such a place, and no other: one deliberately named to bring this man further honor and fame, and to keep his name alive within the US military, down through the genertions?\n\nTo my mind, every additional day she is forced to assist in paying homage to that man - a man who would think of her as a *possession,* to be bought or sold at will - by toiling on a facility bearing his name, is a further insult to her own sacrifice, to her decision to serve and to her patriotism, and an egregious affront to her human dignity.",

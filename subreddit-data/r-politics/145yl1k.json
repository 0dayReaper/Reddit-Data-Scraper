Keep an eye on it, you'll see that cycle coming through. My money is on the eventual talking point of \"Oh how CONVENIENT that they've decided to charge Trump right when election season is starting! You know it's just bad faith accusations to distract from how terrible Biden is!\"\n\nAlso, bonus step:\n\n5.5) After a few days you'll notice a few stragglers didn't get the memo and are still repeating disparate talking points, and it's always amusing because you can tell they've just been busy and didn't have a chance to turn on Fox News in the last couple days",

It just afflicts so many people that nobody has the guts to classify it.\n\nMy pet theory is that it is the most profound societal effect of social media we've seen.  I watched a lot of this kind of thing play out on Facebook between \\~2008 and 2014.\n\nIt used to be that the vast majority of people had essentially no audience to which they could boldly and confidently espouse political beliefs.  Their opinions (or the recitation of whatever pundits they listen to) were pretty well confined to their spouses, immediate family, maybe some close friends and extended family.\n\nBut as soon as Boomers began using Facebook they started broadcasting their views out for their entire friend/family network to see.  \n\nBecause they are/were not the most competent or experienced users of the internet, they weren't prepared for the level of fact-checking that would show up in their comment section.  It was never anything they ever had to confront before.  For their entire lives they just said shit to a handful of people in their immediate circle, most of whom probably didn't say much of anything or just ignored it; some of whom did, but didn't have ready access to \"receipts\" which left those interactions more in the realm of \"debate\".  \n\nTheir egos simply could not handle the fact that every time they charged head-long into posting some emotionally charged political bullshit, they were being humiliated in their comments with overwhelming evidence to prove them wrong.\n\nOften times, people aren't very delicate with their fact-checking.  It was often accompanied with snide, belittling remarks that were no-doubt true, but no-less offensive.  This compounds the emotional response.\n\nInstead of changing their views, they basically said, \"I'll be damned if I'm EVER going to agree with these librul elites who think they're so much better and smarter than everyone!\"  And then actively sought out online sources that would provide them with that sweet, sweet confirmation bias.\n\nThe whole idea of \"alternative facts\" was the most natural progression of this entire thing.  It's what people *needed* to hear to further embolden their delusional thinking.\n\nThat's when the whole thing became more about revenge (\"owning the libs\") than literally anything else.  \n\nAnd, to be honest, I don't think it's necessarily an unnatural response to that kind of stimuli among that demographic of people.  Less than 30% of them completed college.  Their critical thinking abilities--as a whole--are *severely* lacking.  \n\nThey don't know how to adapt to any new information that stands counter to their \"gut-feeling\" beliefs.  They never learned how to accept being proven wrong, especially in front of their entire friend network online.",

The document Trump references on tape was created before Milley was named as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CNN was told, and Milley was later interviewed by investigators. \n\nThe document in question was not specifically referenced in the indictment.  If it ever existed, and Trump could have had it, and it can't now be found, THEN WHO HAS IT?\n\nAny document that the U.S. government believes Trump might have had, and is now missing, could now be in the possession of any foreign intelligence operation that could have come, unbeknownst to our Secret Service, and stolen those secrets so carefully laid out for them by Trump.",

At some point you have to build a case that can be closed rather than just chasing a never-ending stream of evidence and information.\n\nAlso, indictments provide leverage.  If nothing ever happens and things get strung along, key witnesses are more confident in stalling or holding out to see what happens.  But when indictments start flying, people start talking.",

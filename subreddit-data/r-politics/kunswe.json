No opinions, just footage. No one in their right mind can watch this and say this was anything but an attempt to violently overthrow the legally elected government.\n\nWe need to stop sharing small snippets. Show the whole thing. It's honestly terrifying.\n\n*edit: Thanks for the awards but support the video not me. Share it and others like it as much as possible so people can see the real footage.",

We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,\u201d Ehrlichman said. \u201cWe could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d \n\nThis was never a war on people like Newt.",

The whole party just got worse.\n\n**Edit**: ok everyone, the point isn't that Mitt Romney used to be the most evil of evils that exist in the Republican party. The point is that he was the face of the party that represented everything awful that the party represented. He may not have been evil, but he stood behind everything evil the party did, from the largest platform. That's what made him the worst. \n\nAnd the point isn't that he's the most moral of morals today. Just look at the man currently who holds his old job here in MA. Charlie Baker is orders of magnitude better than Mitt, as I'm sure are many other local and state level republicans across the country. But Mitt now has the platform and speaks for the things the Republican party needs to do more than any other on that level. He speaks _against_ some of the evil of the party in a way that no other national Republican seems willing to.\n\nHe's the same person. A religious right idealist who suppresses the rights of minorities and advocates for economic strategies that have proven disastrous over the last 40 years, while defending the war crimes of previous party members. But at least he doesn't want to literally take a steaming shit on the Constitution, and that somehow makes him the best Republican we have on a national stage.",

That brand is now toxic, though not every sensible progressive or moderate conservative wants to align with Democrats.\n\nThe end result is this could be good for democracy as a whole.

Thatbis until W got the US involved in two unwinnable wars and started piling on the deficit. At that point, fiscally speaking, the Ds were a more rational choice.  I felt the Rs didnt deserve a chance after that but it was ingrained in me not to vote Democrat. Romney was okay, but W killed his chance with me. I voted for the down ticket folks, for the best candidate regardless of party. Same with McCain; could not vote for Palin on the ticket. \n\nAfter seeing the competence, grace and class Obama brought to the position, I looked more closely at the D party and cast my first presidential vote for a Dem candidate for Hilary who I felt was the most qualified candidate to present in my lifetime (and I was originally no big fan of the Clintons). Didn't hurt that I found Trump to be a crude lying gasbag bully.\n\nTrump's time in office; the daily onslaught of bad, self-serving, harmful-to-America, planet-destroying decisions and the complicity of the entire R party turned me into a full fledged Democrat. I donate, contact my reps,  write letters to shitty R Senators, send postcards to voters. I am repenting for the error of my earlier days and will never support a Republican candidate, for any position.\n\nTrump made it easy for me to embrace \"the other\" party. His enablers made it permanent, something I regularly proclaim in those letters to shitty R Senators. Hopefully there will be legions like me.",

My other brother didn't like Trump either, but voted for him anyway because he was just that staunch of a repub. \n\nFast forward to 2020, all 3 voted for Biden. Granted they're not huge Biden fans or anything, and they will continue to hold him under scrutiny. They just realize Trump is extremely dangerous and incompetent. My dad and oldest brother said they will never vote Republican ever again, and agreed with me that I was right the entire time about them. \n\nSidenote: my dad worshipped Bill O'Reilly. I lost my dad for years because of him. But then my dad told me he realized what a terrible human being he was. Then when Carlson took over, my dad immediately dismissed him as a weasel. I'm happy I got my family back. I feel so terrible for those who have lost their relatives to the MAGA cult.",

That's the entire point of surplus and deficits after all...save when times are good, spend when times are bad. The Dow Jones was up over 150% under his administration from where it bottomed out after W.\n\nThis whole horse and sparrow economics thing the GOP tries to do has been debunked by every damn economics study in modern history, but they keep doubling down on it. They keep thinking everything in an economy stems from the \"job creators\".\n\nIf this pandemic proved anything, it's that when workers stop and people aren't spending money, the economy collapses. The CEOs and stockholders made more money than ever things year, and yet the economy went to utter shit.\n\nMeantime they all pine for back when America was great. Yeah...back when the top tax bracket was 70% on all income over ~$105,000?\n\nSeems like taxing the rich to support the middle and lower class is what really supercharges the engine driving the US economy.",

I just want to vote for the candidates that appeal to me based on their character, convictions, and policy agenda. For my entire voting life I voted for any party, but mostly Republican when I was younger. \n\nAs time went on, I started leaning more Democrat. I now believe that shift may not have been as much a shift in me as it was a shift in the Republican party. Anyhow, in 2016 I could not believe Trump was the nominee. That was the first year I voted an entire Democrat ballot. I've done it since, and I'll now never vote for a name with an (R) next to it.\n\nI feel that it takes a real lack of morality to be a part of a party that backs Trump. I've been telling everyone since 2016 that he's a moron fascist wannabe, and no one really cared. If Rs are so blind they can't open their eyes to the co-opting of their own party, I don't believe they are capable of performing any job properly.",

What lies outside the Democratic party is mostly radicalism.\n\nMy country's conservative party goes to the DNC, not the RNC (Edit: Or used to at least. They have been radicalizing in step with their US counterparts and its terrifying. Please get your shit together - your country is not the only one being harmed).\n\nThe policies AOC stands for are mostly obvious and engrained concepts in my country, and any politician seriously trying to undermine them would lose all support overnight. \n\nBernie Sanders would be right of center in my country. Edit: Apparently not. Probably still not full left though.\n\nThis explains the homogeneity of the Republican party, and the apparent infighting in the Democratic party. Anywhere else one of these groups would be laughed out of office and the other would have broken up into 3 or 4 sections.",

Theres even strong evidence his anthrax strains came from our labs. \n\nJust so you know we watched Saddam Hussein use a mix of Sarin nerve gas and mustard gas on Iranian troops.  The sarin would paralyze them allowing the mustard gas to enter their lungs with no chance of escape.  And when Iran went to the UN we lobbied them and said \"no it's the Iranians using chemical weapons\" despite the fact that while pushing Hussein back they refused to even cross the border so the world would see they weren't the aggressors.  \n\nWestern journalists like Robert Fisk were first hand witnesses to these atrocities and frankly, because we were giving Saddam Hussein aerial support/intelligence, we knew too.  \n\nSo all the boohooing about his use of chemical weapons is absurd.  We knew what he was doing.  Hell, that's why Bush Sr went into Iraq in the first place (he got rid of the weapons but made the smart decision not to nation build.  He also caused a lot of soldiers to have Gulf War Syndrome (something caused by burning Sarin at low temperatures)the armed forces still refuse to address but ok.  Sadly he's the lesser of two evils.)\n\nGod our country sucks.  Yes we're the baddies.",

Take a look at what r/Conservative was saying over the $2k stimulus checks and you will see that the government supporting regular people over corporations is a bipartisan position so the Republicans instead have to redirect their attention to migrant caravans and trans-bathrooms.",

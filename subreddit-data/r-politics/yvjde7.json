Most people here really like him. \n\nI honestly don't understand what the MA GOP was thinking running Geoff Diehl - they may as well have served the governership to the Dems on a silver platter. Diehl was a typical MAGA type, endorsed by Trump - basically, a far cry from the usual moderate RINO governer that the otherwise-very-blue Massachusetts likes to elect. It's really no surprise that he lost spectacularly to Healey.",

Another election denier goes down - in favor of the person who ran Arizona's 2020 election.\n\n**But we're not done yet!!!**  California still offers several weeks to cure ballots that were rejected for signature reasons, and that could push some Dems in House races over the line.  And in three weeks, Raphael Warnock has to defend Senate seat #51.  Your efforts could help win both!\n\nKeep on working hard and we'll be even closer to saving our country!

Even if in the worst case scenario she \"lost\" that debate, it would have been bad press for a few days and then everyone would move on. Instead she got clobbered with her refusal to debate for a month straight. It definitely hurt her and that's a big part of why her race was so much closer than Mark Kelly's. \n\nI'm certainly glad she won but I'm afraid people will draw the wrong lessons from it.",

Lake didn\u2019t have the opportunity to point to that. neither did Blake Masters, i\u2019m pretty sure. they\u2019re obviously still going to call fraud (&amp; already have) but it\u2019s going to be harder.",

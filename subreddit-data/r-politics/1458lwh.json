She has a different duty station - there is no way she should have been assigned this case without something happening.\n\n~~Based on the leaks coming out, the DoJ specifically requested her, by marking their case as being related to the non-case she heard from last year.~~ *Edit: looks like the DoJ didn't mark it as related, a clerk at the court must have done so and transferred it to Cannon's station - the DoJ may well ask to move it back to Miami.*\n\nThe DoJ almost certainly isn't going to be able to get a new judge (\"we think she's biased\" isn't a legal argument, but is one Trump himself has failed to make again and again recently) - it is on her to recuse herself (or not).\n\n~~But Jack Smith and his team should know what they're doing... They wouldn't have specifically requested her without some sort of a plan for how to deal with it. Smith isn't the kind of person to throw a case deliberately.~~",

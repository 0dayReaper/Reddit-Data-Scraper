Telling an opposing lawyer that representing a lying witness may harm his reputation is not a violation of any law. Second, I am assuming that what Trump\u2019s lawyers have said is true and,of course, there is no chance that Trump\u2019s lawyers are being honest on this issue. If this is all they have,somebody\u2019s going to jail",

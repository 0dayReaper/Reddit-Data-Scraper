As such, the House Session is adjourned until tomorrow at 9am. Expected tomorrow will be rounds of debate and possibly the introduction of Articles of Impeachment.\nTomorrow will be interesting, stay tuned\nEdit to add:\n@StenyHoyer asks for Unanimous Consent on H.R. 21 calling on @VP Pence to convene and mobilize the cabinet to invoke Section 4 of the 25th amendment.\n@RepAlexMooney objects.\nhttps://twitter.com/cspan/status/1348665789012987911?s=20\n\n___\n\n**Edit 2, Electric Boogaloo:**\n\nPart of what I saw is the senate is out until the 19th.\n\nThe democrats started this today bc if they had a unanimous vote things would start now.\n\nBut since a member of the GOP objected it can\u2019t start now. \n\nSo wherever the House starts today or tomorrow or Friday doesn\u2019t matter because the senate won\u2019t get it until the 19th when they reconvene per Mitch M.\n\n___\n\nLink to a proposed timeline of what all is going on \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/11/what-to-expect-this-week-when-congress-moves-to-force-trump-from-office",

Then tomorrow they will hold that vote again under different rules, certain to pass. That will give Pence until the end of Wednesday to act.

Yes, even after Trump has left office.",

Based solely on the few GOP Senators who've spoken out, we might get to a simple majority for disqualification though.  If the trial is delayed long enough for Harris to preside and the new congress to be fully seated, then it's even more likely.\n\nSource: https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html\n\nEdit: Looks like I'm wrong.  A 2/3 majority had to convict Archibold first.  Thanks to those that pointed this out below.",

If the Republicans aren't careful, they'll waste time, energy, and money supporting someone who can't run for president. That being said, it's unlikely that they would pin too many hopes on Donnie while he's in prison.\n\nEdit: Elijah Cummings is dead, as apparently are a few of my brain cells. My bad!",

It will set a precedent and hopefully prevent Trump from getting a pension, office staff and Secret Service protection.  It could also prevent him from running for office again.  Delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's first 100 days would also ensure that a longer trial could take place.  By then we will know more details which will become part of the record.  At the very least you force Republicans to go on record in support of the Constitution or a traitorous President.  McConnell is delaying the vote so he doesn't have to force his caucus to vote for or against impeachment.  No matter if it passes or fails it is historically important to get Republicans on record.",

There was a definition of what \"sexual relations\" was that was agreed upon by both sides' lawyers.  That agreed upon definition did not include him receiving a blowjob.  IIRC, part of the lawyerly definition was \"genital to genital contact\".",

Traditional republicans like Chris Christie, Colin Powell, MD governor Hogan and the Bushes have condemned the violence, helping to create a permission structure for republicans to vote to impeach. They can be followers, not leaders.\n\n2. A number of those senators probably have 2024 aspirations, and may see this as an opportunity to carve out their spots as \u201creasonable republicans\u201d, trying to put themselves in opposition to Cruz, Hawley and Trump, and maybe win back the women and suburbs.\n\n3. A number of senators may have 2024 aspirations, and want to harness Trump\u2019s base. But the only way to do that is if trump is barred from running again in 2024. \n\n4. A number of senators are probably staring down retirement at the end of their term. I mentioned Toomey earlier, but Richard Burr is also retiring, so won\u2019t necessarily suffer political consequences one way or the other. Chuck Grassley is 89, and as president pro tempore of the senate was in particular danger last week. I would imagine there are a couple other senators that are expected to retire before their next election and can vote to impeach without fear of backlash from their constituents. \n\n5. Don\u2019t discount how pissed some of them may be. Thankfully no lawmakers were hurt, but that wasn\u2019t a guaranteed outcome last Wednesday afternoon. If a couple things had broken differently and some of our congresspersons could have been severely injured or even killed. This isn\u2019t rhetorical to some of them anymore. It almost had real consequences. They had to go back to their offices to find furniture upturned, and boot prints on their desks. This isn\u2019t hypothetical anymore. \n\nAnyway, if I had to bet right now, I\u2019d say they\u2019re going to fall just shy of the 67 votes necessary to convict. But there\u2019s still time for us to change that. Keep the pressure on. Make Hawley and Cruz suffer the consequences of their seditious actions. Make the milquetoast republicans realize it\u2019s political suicide to stand with Trump or the seditionists the way that they are. Continue encouraging donors to drop funding for politicians that supported this (and while we\u2019re at it, how about insurrection apologists like Hanity, Carlson, Ingram, etc.) We have a voice, and we can use it!\n\nEdit: Correct the autocorrect.",

The media focuses too much on the furthest fringes of his base!\"\n\nWhen I texted with him on Friday,  he said definitively and unprompted that Trump should be impeached/removed from office.\n\nI expressed surprise, and actually thought he was being sarcastic, and he said, verbatim: \"1.) It's just the right thing to do.  2.) He has gone way too far this time.  3.)  The only way to save the Republican Party is by making sure he can never run for another political office ever again.\"\n\nIf you'd have asked me on Thursday morning how this guy I'm referring to would've reacted to the riots, I would have sworn he'd say, \"These people are just crazies... Trump always says stupid shit on the stump.  He hasn't changed, but *they* have gone off the rails.  Nobody in their right mind would actually believe he meant for them to storm the Capitol.\"\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI can only hope that for every one \"moderate\" Trump diehard like my friend, there are two Republicans out there who did the \"held my nose and voted for him\" routine who are completely done with him.",

A leader or organization uses rhetoric in the mass media against a group of people.\n2. This rhetoric, while hostile or hateful, doesn\u2019t explicitly tell someone to carry out an act of violence against that group, but a person, feeling threatened, is motivated to do so as a result.\n3. That individual act of political violence can\u2019t be predicted as such, but that violence will happen is much more probable thanks to the rhetoric.\n4. This rhetoric is thus called *stochastic* *terrorism* because of the way it incites random violence.",

Watch as his speech calling for his \u2018loved\u2019 and \u2018very special\u2019 supporters to leave peacefully becomes a Gandhi-esque manifesto.\n\nAnd then they\u2019ll reach for the dictionary: what do we mean by the term \u2018incitement\u2019? They\u2019ll tie themselves in knots to imply a man screaming fire in a crowded theatre isn\u2019t to blame for a stampede, because he never explicitly told anyone to put one foot in front of the other.\n\nAnd then they\u2019ll deflect: what about the BLM insurrection? Where\u2019s the Democratic outcry over that? Proof - for those who don\u2019t pay attention - that impeachment is a one-sided political hit job. \n\nAnd the Dems will be stuck in their usual lose-lose position: either beat their head against a brick wall expecting these bad faith actors to grow up, or rip up their old rule book and play into accusations they are the radicals they\u2019ve always been accused of being.\n\nThe Dems need to accept they will always be painted as the wicked party whatever they do. \n\nPack the courts. Give statehood to PR and DC. Abolish the electoral college. \n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t like giving everyone an equal vote and giving votes to disenfranchised citizens, they should ask themselves why.\n\nEdit: a word.",

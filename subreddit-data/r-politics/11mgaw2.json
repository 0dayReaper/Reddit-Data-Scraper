This takes money from being a means to an end to being the end in and of itself. all of a sudden, surplus wealth beyond practical utility becomes desirable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\namerica's roots are deeply intwined with calvinism. the founding fathers talk about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource: one of the landmark works by one of the fathers of modern sociology.

Asbestos was banned in 1989, and had a very sharp decline starting in 1972, it's very unlikely that you have asbestos insulation in the walls, as there was a rapid shift to fibreglass and Rockwool around that period. Being that manufactured homes are built in factories I would even go so far as to assume they would have switched to fibreglass insulation sooner than general construction because it is faster to install than loose asbestos.\n\nYou can check by taking off an outlet cover and looking at the insulation around it, and that won't disturb the insulation.",

New asbestos products can not be produced, but existing products are grandfathered. You can go to Home Depot right now and buy products containing asbestos. It won't say asbestos, as that is not a single product but rather a category for several different minerals. The label will most likely say mineral fibers - which is asbestos.\n\nAlmost all asbestos insulation has been removed by now, but asbestos is found in hundreds of materials; it's an incredibly useful material. These days you will primarily find it in commercial pipe insulation, in joint compound, VCT flooring, and flooring adhesives. It can also be found in thin set and grout for ceramic floor and wall tile. If you have popcorn ceilings or Crow's Foot textured walls, there's a 90 - 100% chance that you have asbestos.\n\nThe asbestos in these materials is safe and can remain in place for decades as long as it's not disturbed. The moment you start drilling, scraping, sanding, etc. you will be putting asbestos into the air.",

My property tax is $9,000 this year on home appraised at $350k, of which I only own $110k equity in. That\u2019s an 8% tax on my unrealized gains every year. If my property taxes get too high for me to afford, I may have to sell my home - if the tax on billionaire\u2019s assets became too much for their income, why couldn\u2019t they do the same?",

Your property tax is how TX politicians can rail against taxes at the top of their lungs, and then make sure your appraisal goes up by the max it's allowed to every year as a back door tax hike. Then they target the poor with things like the VAT you mentioned because being poor clearly means you don't deserve to both eat and have a way to get to your job in a state with no public transit to speak of anywhere.  \n  \nPersonally, I think property tax is pretty terrible. It's the only tax that can render someone homeless who has paid off their home. This, and the yearly backdoor tax hike of property taxes, hits those on a fixed income or those who could barely afford their home hardest.\n  \n  \nEdit: A huge feature of the property tax racket in TX is that no legislator has to be accountable for your compounding-year-over-year tax hike. Nobody votes on your taxes increasing 10% this year, then 10% on that higher value the next year and so on.  \n  \nWe were there for 9 years and they almost never came in under the 10%, maybe because the tax appraisal was so much higher than what we paid that they 'lost' a lot on the successful challenge.",

It allows for nonpayment yearly accruing against the house. The cost for this is ~2% of the amount as simple interest (non-compounding). Paying a hundred dollars a year to save several thousand in after-tax dollars is game changing for those on a fixed budget. Heck, with 2% simple interest, and high interest savings accounts over 4%, it\u2019s basically free money to not pay the government. \n\nThere\u2019s even a deferral option for families with young kids, but it\u2019s multiples more expensive and requires ~20% equity minimum, which I totally get but is counterintuitive to who it\u2019s trying to help.

Sure you have a nicer house and nicer cars and take nicer vacations and you don't really have to worry about money but you still drive your own car and pay a mortgage on your house etc. \n\nSomewhere around $100 million there's a shift where your time becomes more important than money.  The marginal value of money is sufficiently low to you that you can pay for things without thinking about the cost. You have enough money to hire to pay to make your life easier for all sorts of mundane details.   You have a staff. A cook for your house, a maid for your house and a driver for your car etc.   You want to take a vacation but it's inconvenient that your house isn't ready? You can hire a staff to stay there and make sure it's ready the whole summer. You have full-time people who help with your finances.  But you can't ignore the money entirely. \n\nAs you approach a billion you reach the point where money is no object for the most part. You can afford whatever you want.  Your limitations are social and political rather than monetary.You live essentially like a head of state. With teams of people whose job it is to ensure that your every need is met before you think of it.  \n\nI would add another category and suggest that at the true apex, where you're talking tens and hundreds of billions of dollars that those people do literally have the same power as heads of state.  Their security may not rival the US military but the logistics are pretty similar. If they leave they can get picked up in a helicopter to fly to the plane get on the plane flower they want have everything arranged for them when they get there and go home the same way.",

There are undoubtedly more loopholes that only the accountants to the rich know about.\n\nThe only thing that would actually catch billionaires isn't an income tax, it's a wealth tax.",

Tax the daylights out of the wealthy.\n\nAnd no, that doesn't mean upper middle class people, because no matter how much they try and front like they're rich, they aren't. \n\n\nWe're talking the actual rich, like Buffett, Bezos, Elongated Muskrat, Peter Theil ,Koch brothers, The Greens, The Waltons etc .\n\nWe could tax just those few and literally end world hunger as well as give every man woman and child their very own house , full education, medical care, daycare, completely eradicate homelessness, and REFUND Social Security of the trillions Reagan and his billionaire cronies STOLE from it, and it would be solvent in perpetuity.\n\nYet, they would STILL be the richest people on earth. Still wallowing in their largesse like pigs in poop, and have exceedingly lavish lifestyles.\n\nWon't hurt em but  tiny pinch if at all, and it will  save the rest of us and what's left of our country.  \n\nTax. The. Rich. It's the only thing left to do before America becomes a real life \"Modest Proposal\" that Johnathan Swift would be appalled and amused by it.\n\nForks up people, there's a whole lot of fat n gristle to get chewing on here, let's do it already.. pass  me the hot sauce ya? These billionaires have absolutely NO taste and definitely got zero seasoning \ud83d\ude02!!",

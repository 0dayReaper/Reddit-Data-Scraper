This should be the lead. It's. Not.\n\nMakes it feel like the entire article is one very long caveat to lead up to this.\n\n&gt;And we certainly do not welcome the precedent of a federal prosecutor, who ultimately reports to the president, indicting that president\u2019s leading rival for reelection.\n\nUmm, why not? Trump wanted to announce early for this very reason.\n\nNo one should be prosecuted just because they are a candidate opposing a sitting President, but the other extreme should not occur either: no criminal should seek legal shelter in declaring candidacy\n\n&gt;We understand why many conservatives are unwilling to view the charges against Trump in a vacuum given that the Justice Department let Hillary Clinton off the hook for her reckless handling of government secrets and the resulting cover-up, that President Biden is unlikely to pay a price for his own mishandling of classified documents, and that Democrats and their allies have pursued a yearslong campaign to get Trump\n\nWow, they really don't seem perturbed at a candidate being investigated if it's a Democrat.\n\nNo mention in this article of Trumps efforts to get Biden investigated or charged with something.\n\nAnd there is an argument to be made that Comey investigating Hillary again just before the election shaved off a significant number of voters that might have resulted in her winning in 2016.\n\nThat's election interference Trump benefitted from and wanted to benefit from again in 2020. No mention of that here.\n\nBidens classified document \"scandal\" shouldn't even be compared to Clinton's email scandal and certainly not to Trumps. Their conduct and the sheer scale of the documents in question is vastly different.\n\n\n&gt;\"Democrats and their allies have pursued a yearslong campaign to get Trump\"\n\nWith very specific charges and allegations and lots of evidence. \n\nTrump didn't survive two impeachment by being innocent. He did it because Senate Republicans literally said they would not consider the evidence.",

He continued to believe this after being told by his staff, his lawyers, the national archives, the FBI, and the courts he was wrong.  In spite of being indicted, he still believes he did nothing unlawful.  He will claim this after his last appeal before the Supreme Court fails. \n\nI find it incredible that Trump\u2019s most avoidable and dumbest set of crimes might be why he dies in prison.",

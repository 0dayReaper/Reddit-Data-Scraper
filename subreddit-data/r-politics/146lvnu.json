The GOP's last chance to not go down with the trump was when Josh Hawley broke ranks and declared that he would vote to acquit trump in the Senate. Before that moment, the GOP senate caucus could have held ranks, said \"the evidence was overwhelming\" and purged trump for once and all in a way that would have barred him from running again, even as a third party candidate. They failed to take this opportunity and now they're tied to the mast of SS trump.",

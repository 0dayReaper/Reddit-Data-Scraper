            "comment": "I love how this continues to get misreported. \n\nTrump did not get charged with mishandling classified materials. \n\nHe got charged under the Espionage Act (specifically Section 793(e) of Title 18) which pre-dates classification and doesn\u2019t reference it. Specifically, he got charged with not returning documents to contain national defense information. \n\nIf any of them were to be charged with mishandling classified documents it would be under Section 1924 of Title 18. Trump was not charged with this. \n\nThe likely reasoning stems back to 2009 and EO 13526, which lays out who are classification authorities. It states the POTUS and VPOTUS as national classification authorities (Basically Trump while pres, Pence while VP, and Biden while VP had broad powers to classify/declassify things at will), as well as Agency Heads over their departments (so HRC was a state department classification authority during her tenure). \n\nIt\u2019s already been considered and found valid that a classification authority saying out loud the classified info de facto de-classifies it. It\u2019s an easy argument to make that in the same vein, the act of \u2018taking\u2019 a document could be seen the same way. This largely gets Trump, Pence, and HRC off of any 1924 charges if so. Biden while VP as well, but there was some concern that docs could backdate to his time as Senator, which is why I feel like he also got a special investigator. \n\n793(e) is concerned with the return of documents containing national defense information, does not mention classification status, and gives an out - basically if the government says \u2018Hi Tom, we know you\u2019re in possession of these three documents pertaining to national defense. We\u2019ll send Bob to collect them on Thursday.\u2019 On Thursday, you claim to only have one of the three documents. Government doublechecks and investigates and finds you still have the other two? Then you get charged under 793(e). \n\nEven if Biden/Pence had NDI documents, the mere act of them returning them when identified gets them out of a 793(e) charge. Trump did not do this.",

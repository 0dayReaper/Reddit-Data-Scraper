Just about every white male had a gun, and could shoot. The Revolutionary leadership distrusted the mobs of poor. But they knew the Revolution had no appeal to slaves and Indians. They would have to woo the armed white population. \n\n&gt; This was not easy. Yes, mechanics and sailors, some others, were incensed against the British. But general enthusiasm for the war was not strong. While much of the white male population went into military service at one time or another during the war, only a small fraction stayed. John Shy, in his study of the Revolutionary army (A People Numerous and Armed), says they \"grew weary of being bullied by local committees of safety, by corrupt deputy assistant commissaries of supply, and by bands of ragged strangers with guns in their hands calling themselves soldiers of the Revolution.\" Shy estimates that perhaps a fifth of the population was actively treasonous. **John Adams had estimated a third opposed, a third in support, a third neutral.**\n\n\nHoward Zinn, a People's History of the United States\n\nhttps://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnkin5.html",

That's why. AOC had a different approach to this (a $50k floor) but that means that she can't afford to pay the going rate for senior staff which means her senior staff have personal or family wealth to offset that. So, same issue just kicked up the seniority list.",

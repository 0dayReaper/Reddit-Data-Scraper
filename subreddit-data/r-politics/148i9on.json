            "comment": "Here is the beginning of the story:  \n\n\nIt might take a Democratic campaign staffer just a few minutes to write the script for a scorching attack ad based on the federal indictment of Donald Trump and his alleged conduct handling classified documents.  \n\n\nThe allegations that Trump swiped top secret materials about military and nuclear capabilities, waved them around to guests at his Mar-a-Lago estate, and stored them in bathrooms might constitute as compelling and concise a case against his re-election as exists.  \n\n\nYet, it\u2019s possible\u2014even very likely\u2014that such an attack ad will never be made in the context of the 2024 presidential campaign.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s something like the ultimate catch-22 for Democrats: Although the facts in the indictment could have a unique potency in the race, they can\u2019t talk about them for fear of risking the integrity of a case that Republicans have attacked as a politically motivated ploy to derail Trump.  \n\n\nEven as Republicans have largely shied from explicitly defending Trump on the merits, they have loudly howled that the indictment is tantamount to political prosecution from a president seeking to eliminate his likely rival in the upcoming election.  \n\n\nPresident Joe Biden has consistently declined to comment on the work of Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the indictment. Over the weekend, Biden claimed he had not spoken with Attorney General Merrick Garland about it. And his White House has long stated that he had no role in Department of Justice probes both into Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents and his own, which is being led by Special Counsel Robert Hur.",

            "comment": "&gt;With a heated GOP primary brewing, and some Trump challengers and former loyalists growing increasingly willing to attack him over the indictment, there is a consensus developing among some Democrats that they are better served by ignoring the indictment and focusing on Biden\u2019s record.  \n\u201cThe calculus everyone is making right now is: Shut the fuck up, let the Republicans kill each other, let things play out while we focus on Biden\u2019s accomplishments and economic wins\u2014and let that in itself be the contrast,\u201d said a Democratic strategist, who requested anonymity to candidly describe the mood in their circles.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s like when your ex is a gambling addict or doing coke\u2014you let everyone see it,\u201d the strategist continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to beat them when they\u2019re down. You just have to look hot and post bikini photos.\u201d  \nIf anything, one Democratic operative said, the party\u2019s top task will be to connect the indictment to a broader framing that has proven politically potent for them: emphasizing what House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries calls the \u201cTeam Normal\u201d versus \u201cTeam Extreme\u201d divide.  \n\n\nI can see how this can work, especially since the GOP all do try to destroy each other in the absence of an enemy to be outraged about (such as Carlson's exit form Fox which led to so many declaring the network \"too woke\"), but at the same time I feel they should at least work on a backup plan since there's still the chance of things like Trump rallying support while imprisoned and narrative control in media outlets to suggest it is politically done, or like certain former bosses of mine who might be like \"okay the gOP is launching the coup but I don't really care, nothing matters but our jobs\" and such.

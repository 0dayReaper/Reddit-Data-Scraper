People had high hopes for him and he\u2019s nearly squandered it on this *one* issue. \n\nPublic opinion for this project was totally ignored. Even if you believe that the facility would be beneficial (I don\u2019t), there\u2019s no reason it has to exist inside the Atlanta perimeter. Georgia has no shortage of undeveloped land, some of it just outside the chosen location (away from resident housing). The perplexing part of the location is the admission that this will be used to train state, not city, police. \n\nAs for the facility itself\u2026It\u2019s a glorified paintball arena, for the purposes of teaching tactical techniques that most the populace has deemed inappropriate as of recent. You teach people their job is like war, and they\u2019ll behave as such.",

It teaches cops that the only thing that matters is that *they* come home safe at night. No matter how many \"civilians\" are killed, no matter how many rights are trampled on, no matter how many dogs are used for target practice, it's all fine as long as *police* aren't harmed.\n\nThat's the only thing that matters to police today in America: the police. We saw it writ large at Uvalde, and America did nothing. We just took it on the chin and moved on like it was nothing. There's been huge coverage of this with no results and no change. John Oliver did a great episode on it, as well as many, many others.",

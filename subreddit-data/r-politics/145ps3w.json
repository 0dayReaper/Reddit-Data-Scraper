Sure, some people don't know the value of voting down the ballot--they know that they're in a blue or red enough state/district that their vote won't swing those big offices they do care about. That doesn't mean they haven't formed an opinion on Trump. Or Biden. Maybe their opinion is that neither is sufficient to vote for. Sure, they don't understand that protest voting is more effective than not voting, bc no one knows why one didn't vote, but again, it doesn't mean they don't follow politics. Finally, you have disenfranchisement etc. Republicans pass these restrictive voting laws that bring turnout down, meanwhile we saw in 2020 that when mail-in is easier, turnout goes up. No way to know how turnout would look if voting were even easier.\n\nI'm sure there are people who haven't formed an opinion and don't follow politics. I believe you that you know them. But turnout has way too many factors to draw a conclusion like that. \n\n[The last poll when he left office, 4% of people had \"No opinion\"](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx)\n\nAnd in sept-nov of 2020, only 1 or 2% said they had no opinion",

Polling is fairly accurate.\n\nThe media and the public treats a poll as a gospel prediction of the future. Pollsters do not see it that way.\n\n\"our model estimates that the final national polls will miss by about 3 percentage points in an average year. (That\u2019s why we call a 3-point miss a \u201cnormal-sized polling error.\u201d) In other words, a 4-point polling error is somewhat par for the course, although maybe you could call it a bogey.\" ...\n\n\"Say the final polling averages miss by a bit more than 3 points on average, as our forecast assumes. That means the margin of error is closer to 7 or 8 points. And every presidential election so far this century has fallen within that range.  So if you\u2019re coming to the polls for strong probabilistic hints of what is going to happen, they can provide those \u2014 and the hints will usually lead you in roughly the right direction, as they did this year. But if you\u2019re looking for certainty, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.\"\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-werent-great-but-thats-pretty-normal/\n\n\nThe media acts like margin of error is not a thing.",

I want people who voted against Trump, but i also want conservatives if they aren't zealots. Such people are rare, but obviously his zealous supporters should be disqualified, and so should those who zealously oppose him. (Like me.)\n\nI don't think they should aim for people who haven't heard of him. What we need to do, as was the point the article was making, is hurry about these cases, because the longer they go, the more opinions are formed.\n\nFrom those numbers, though, i would say it's more like 2% had no opinion of him 2 and a half years ago. Presumably that's lower now. But the statement wasn't about forming an opinion on Trump in general, anyway. It regards forming opinions related to this case.\n\nAs to the accuracy of polling, it doesnt matter what pollsters and analysts say, because i can see the numbers myself. I can compare the poll results to what the election ended up being. \nI could analyze according to which pollsters tend to be more accurate over time. Polling is a scientific process.",

Sure, some people don't know the value of voting down the ballot--they know that they're in a blue or red enough state/district that their vote won't swing those big offices they do care about. That doesn't mean they haven't formed an opinion on Trump. Or Biden. Maybe their opinion is that neither is sufficient to vote for. Sure, they don't understand that protest voting is more effective than not voting, bc no one knows why one didn't vote, but again, it doesn't mean they don't follow politics. Finally, you have disenfranchisement etc. Republicans pass these restrictive voting laws that bring turnout down, meanwhile we saw in 2020 that when mail-in is easier, turnout goes up. No way to know how turnout would look if voting were even easier.\n\nI'm sure there are people who haven't formed an opinion and don't follow politics. I believe you that you know them. But turnout has way too many factors to draw a conclusion like that. \n\n[The last poll when he left office, 4% of people had \"No opinion\"](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx)\n\nAnd in sept-nov of 2020, only 1 or 2% said they had no opinion",

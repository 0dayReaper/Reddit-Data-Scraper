Chimpanzees, much like conservatives, are prone to violence, war, and need a strict hierarchy system.  They do not get along well with outsiders.\n\nBonobos, on the other hand, are very peaceful even with other packs that they meet, and do not have the violent tendencies or power struggles seen in chimpanzees. They are more community and pleasure oriented.",

Religion leashes people, contains feelings, and forces a organized will. I find it terrifying if it does this. Not all religions mind you, but I see this a lot in fundamentalist and major religions. I have a special dislike for Catholicism. At a high level is does the things above. It leashes and restricts. It shamed and castrates free will. \n\nIt creates this imbalance in us versus them when looking at others who celebrate their identity and freedoms. It creates the jealousy and fury we see now.

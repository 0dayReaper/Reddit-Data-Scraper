Example being Lakewood church in Houston, TX. The church is the old venue where the NBA team played their games. It\u2019s just one big prosperity gospel grift and they should 100% be taxed.",

This will stop so let this email serve as its final warning for anyone that has a disagreement on Superintendent Walters' beliefs to fight the **liberal woke culture** seeping into our schools, **liberal indoctrination** in the classrooms, and **pushing pornography** in schools. I'm instructing everyone that any and all documents from SDE and internal discussions are to be handled with utmost confidentiality. All employees of SDE will adhere to the **highest standard of professionalism and integrity.**",

More people are motivated by the abortion ruling.\n\nHaving said that I must emphasize the need for Dems to vote.  Ignore the third parties, ignore the dirty tricks.  Independents, vote based on verifiable truths, not propaganda.  Fascists are trying to make deeper inroads into our Democracy and it must be stopped. \n\nThe Right will complain that Biden is too old.  He was too old when he was elected.

I know the 18 year olds likely won't get out to vote, but I am curious if the 30 year olds that didn't vote start to get involved as they get a little bit older each election cycle. Because if that's the case, then the GOP is pretty much screwed (if it's a fair election, which is... Hard to say on that end)",

He can't even be seen as an equal in a debate among his peers.  So he will commit more crimes daily and they are added to the pile of things that he will never face the reality of.  Just by tweets and rallies he commits purjuries, stochastic terrorism, character assassination, and open calls for overthrowing the government, and we have all just gotten numb to it.\n\nHe's had every gift this country has to offer and hes squandered that as routine, only to put his hand out for more.  He's had more chances than anyone, and never earned it.  He has caused harm again and again by a system that allows him infinite opportunies and shown to only learn how to be more destructive.  \n\nWe've helped him fail up to the highest responsibilities of the country.  At every turn he acted solely for his own gain while doing the absolute minimum when disasters struck.  Hurricanes, financial meltdowns, and a pandemic all made worse by his inability to rise to the occasion.\n\nIt time to at a minim start taking back some of his rights and start to make him see the consequences of his actions.",

He is leading the probes into Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and his actions around January 6, as well as the inquiry into his retention of classified documents.\n\n\n\nMeadows is said to have answered questions relating to both criminal investigations into the former president while appearing in front of the grand jury, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Meadows has gained additional significance as part of the classified documents probe after reports emerged that there is audio of Trump admitting in July 2021 that he had retained a secret Pentagon paper, and that the former president no longer had the authority to declassify it.\n\n\nTrump is said to have made the remarks during a meeting at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, with two people who were helping to write Meadows' biography, although the former White House chief of staff wasn't present himself.\n\n\n\n\"Without commenting on whether or not Mr Meadows has testified before the grand jury or in any other proceeding, Mr Meadows has maintained a commitment to tell the truth where he has a legal obligation to do so,\" George Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said in a statement to The New York Times",

There's plenty of room for folks to run a business in a properly designed infrastructure, but as long as money (&amp; religion) infests politics, there will always be a gigantic gravitation towards this type of parasitic corruption.\n\nBack to fucking DeJoy.\n\nBiden has now made 5 appointments to the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service (3 Dems, 1 Rep &amp; 1 Ind), who in tern decide who the Postmaster General is. Two more board members terms are up (one Dem and one REP)  on Dec 8th. If we can hold the Senate, that will allow decent appointments and would complete the effort to put the board in sound hands for the first time since Trump started to stack it.\n\nLet's watch and see if that gets it done, and we can launch DeJoy out a high office window.

And years ago when Obamacare was passed, and so they really DID need to make major changes in TurboTax to deal with the credit, they royally screwed it up. \n\nBut Intuit and H&amp;R Block and Liberty Tax have lobbied hard against the IRS doing this for years.

The IRS knows exact payment amounts for about 44% of tax filers. The problem, of course, is that they don't know *which* of the tax filers they know exact payments for and which they don't.  \n  \nFor a more concrete example, let's imagine that number was 50%, not 44%.   \nThe IRS thinks that Alice owes $14,000 and Bob owes $12,000.  \nOne of those is correct.  \nHowever, the other person was in an accident and was blinded this year. That changes their tax deduction and thus the amount they owe.  \nSo in this situation, the IRS knows exact payments for 50% of these tax filers (Bob and Alice). But they don't know which of their two figures is the accurate one and which is wrong.  \n  \nThe IRS knows a lot, but it doesn't know everything, like who is blind, who has custody of kids following a divorce, etc. So they can come up with numbers for everyone, but those numbers are wrong 56% of the time.  \n  \nDoes that mean the system has to stay like it is now? Of course not! They could say \"We *think* you owe $X, based on the following assumptions. You only need to do your own taxes this year if a correction is necessary.\" (like if you went blind and they didn't know that). Or, even better, they could have a site with a series of questions (\"Are you blind\" \"Is your spouse blind\" etc.) that you answer and they spit out the final number for you. Or, even better, they streamline the exceptions (like, my heart goes out to people whose kids have been kidnapped, but do the 1040 instructions really need to have special clauses related specifically to kidnapping?), so you answer only extremely basic questions.  \n  \nThere's a lot they could do to make things easier, I'm not disagreeing with ***that*** at all. But this constant reddit meme of \"the IRS already knows exactly how much I know\" is silly. Audits wouldn't even *exist* if they knew how much you owed.",

I spent *four days* reading publications and websites and filling out forms and schedules and worksheets, and I have *zero clue* if I did ANY of it correctly, because I came up with different answers depending on how one interprets the definition of certain words.

Anything that falls outside of those bars and under a certain income bracket gets flagged for automatic investigation. So they literally already know how much you should pay/get back.\n\nThey should just send a fucking bill or a check. You can always appeal it or go through the motions to file and get a different result, but there's no reason for this paper filing middle man business to continue whatsoever.",

And you legally have the right to file an amendment to your tax return, *even if they did it for you*, meaning those deductions are not just gone and lost forever - it's on you to go get them.\n\nWhich is really what makes all of this so absurd. The *default* workflow should be \"accept this or make changes,\" not \"let's both do some work and compare notes to see who got the closest... ooh, your number doesn't match with mine, here's a penalty.\"",

(then they lose like 15-20% of their return, instead of waiting for the IRS to process the return and issue a refund)\n\nMy brother uses an accountant to do his taxes and his accountant really knows their stuff and has saved him a ton by calling him up and telling him to do A, B or C before X date to save Z amount of money\u2026  something I\u2019m considering now that I\u2019m finally earning a little more money.. \n\nBtw, I want to send my personal thanks to Australia for fostering one of the best bands ever..

You can file electronically through the IRS or physically via mail and the only cost would be postage.\n\nThe problem is the forms can be somewhat complicated and there's extra forms you may need but don't know about. So the tax preparation softwares ask you a bunch of questions which they can then fill out the forms for you and e-file the return. There's some income limit that certain companies have to provide for free if you make below that limit I think. But they may bury the option to use that software or not market it (like TurboTax).\n\nThings like deductions or tax credits people may not know about until using a software. All the deductions and credits are part of what can make it confusing",

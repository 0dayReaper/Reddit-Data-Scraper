He can literally claim that the anti-abortion laws/anti-LGBTQ+ laws are causing a state of emergency and instruct the ED to pause loans again. To my knowledge, the recent debt ceiling bill stipulated that loans are to resume, but it _doesn't_ forbid Biden from declaring a new emergency.\n\nIt honestly wouldn't surprise me if this ends up being a \"strategic\" voting issue going into 2024. Dems are successful in getting the youth vote at this time, and the harsh majority of single-issue younger voters care about abortion access, LGBTQ+ protections, and of course, _student loans._\n\nIt would be a stupid thing to turn it into a voting issue to get folks up into the polls, but it would be pretty effective in getting college seniors who're facing an immediate reality of student loan payments kicking up within 12mos to go vote.",

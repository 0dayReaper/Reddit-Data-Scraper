    "postText": "On Thursday, in a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court struck down Alabama's congressional maps. Republican-nominated justices Roberts and Kavanaugh joined the Court's liberal voting block in *Allen v. Milligan* to find that Alabama's seven US House districts were drawn intentionally to dilute the voting power of Black Alabamians and to order a redrawing that creates an additional Black-majority district to align with the state's 27% Black population.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Supreme Court rules against Alabama in high-stakes Voting Rights Act case](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-alabama-redistricting/) | cbsnews.com\n[Supreme Court says Alabama should draw new voting map favorable to Black residents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/08/supreme-court-alabama-redistricting-voting-rights/) | washingtonpost.com\n[Supreme Court rules against Alabama congressional map critics said disadvantaged Black voters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/08/supreme-court-decision-alabama-redistricting-voting-rights-act/11096271002/) | usatoday.com\n[Supreme Court rules in favor of Black voters in Alabama redistricting case](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-redistricting-race-voting-rights-alabama-af0d789ec7498625d344c0a4327367fe) | apnews.com\n[Supreme Court strikes down Alabama congressional map in victory for voting rights advocates](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4040316-supreme-court-strikes-down-alabama-congressional-map-in-victory-for-voting-rights-advocates/) | thehill.com\n[Supreme Court orders voting maps redrawn in Alabama](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/politics/supreme-court-alabama-voting-rights-milligan/index.html) | cnn.com\n[Alabama discriminated against Black voters, US supreme court rules](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/supreme-court-voting-rights-decision-allen-milligan) | theguardian.com\n[Supreme Court strikes down Alabama congressional map in voting rights dispute](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-alabama-congressional-map-voting-rights-dispute-rcna64476) | nbcnews.com\n[Supreme Court strikes down Alabama congressional map in voting rights dispute.

Then the court tells them that the new one is unacceptable and sets a new deadline for the legislature to fix it, and the whole process literally repeats itself again while the original unconstitutional electoral map stays in place.",

This complicated things in Texas because the larger cities have lines of race that kind of halfway line up with politics so you can sneakily do one while appearing to do the other.  Alabama is interesting/almost unique in its racial distribution which makes it REALLY easy to see if the map is just racist or an R/D thing.  \n\nThe good thing is that this precedent will apply in Texas, Florida, and Georgia in similar cases so those maps will need to be modified too.  Of course those states have a LOT more population than Alabama so the districts are just much physically smaller in the bigger cities and so easier to fuck around with (maps in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, and to a lesser extent Tampa, San Antonio, Austin and Orlando can be badly gerrymandered very easily because the difference between a good district and a bad district can be a mile or less).",

Thus their claim that a race-blind approach would have 1 black district.\n\nBut with a black population of 27%, how is that possible? You can literally sit with a pencil and draw simple squares and rectangles and come up with several district plans that would be 2/7 majority black. Is it really as cheap as they produced 10 million maps, and then showed the million that supported their claim? That seems almost unbelievable. Or is there something else I'm missing?",

Although he gets very little credit for doing so now *after* the 2022 election. \n\n[Here\u2019s a great podcast episode](https://www.fivefourpod.com/episodes/merrill-v-milligan/) reviewing the earlier opinion of the district court. It was such a blatant violation of the Voting Rights Act that the two Trump appointed judges on the 3 panel court agreed that Alabama should redraw it.",

They are always fantasizing about some utopian past, where things were better because the women weren't so uppity, and the kids stayed in the closet, and the minorities knew their place.

Thats with me wearing masks outdoors, keeping windows shut, running a HEPA filter and AC in my apartment. First time in my life I've needed an inhaler or nebulizer. I moved here in 2016 and was not smart about the wildfire smoke exposure for the first 5 years. You really don't understand how much an asthmatic reaction fucks with you until you experience it. I couldn't talk by the time i got myself to urgent care, i was so breathless. I was whispering to the receptionist despite my best effort to speak up. I was tired and on the edge of panic. I cried.",

In Alberta we were having elections for premier and the conservative voters were suggesting the fires here were set by the liberals (democrats) . \n\nAs long as it's nothing to do with climate change, we don't have to do anything about it other than breathe in that nice fresh campfire air.",

My province has NEVER been impacted by wildfires to this extent in its history yet a bunch of historic factors led to this happening.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s also unusual that for the past 10 days it has barely stopped raining. It has been steady on and off rain cycles for 10 days. It\u2019s not supposed to stop until Sunday at the earliest.\n\nThis is not normal. None of this is normal. I\u2019m 22 so relatively young yet this is something that only continues to happen. This is no different than the fact we get impacted by a hurricane every year now - something that was a once in every few yea occurrence.",

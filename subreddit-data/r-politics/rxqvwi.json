The Implant rep I worked with daily was specifically assigned to our hospital because we had such a constantly high ortho case load that he needed to be there full time to keep us supplied. He wasn\u2019t allowed to buy us lunch or give any gifts more valuable than essentially a cheap ink pen because of state law (I don\u2019t remember the actual $ limit but it was very low). I was a scrub tech, I had nearly zero chance of influencing which brand of surgical implantation my ortho doctor, who\u2019s been doing surgery since I was in high school, used in their cases. Meanwhile my state senators who set budgets make their careers off kickdowns, \u201cgifts\u201d, and \u201cdonors\u201d. I didn\u2019t give a damn about not getting free shit but if small time zero influence workers can\u2019t get simple kick downs for making their rep rich AF those with power shouldn\u2019t either.",

In fact, we had a dedicated sales office in Bentonville, AR just for Walmart. The Walmart employees were completely prohibited from taking even a 10\u00a2 pen lest it corrupt their purchasing decisions. Getting caught even taking a vendor notepad was grounds for immediate dismissal. I heard that conference and meeting rooms were bugged specifically to enforce this provision.\n\nFucking Walmart has greater integrity than the most powerful group of lawmakers in the free world.\n\nGee, I wonder why we're having so many problems in Washington...",

This new noise about insider trading is a minuscule compared to the corruption of rich \"donations\", i.e. Bribes. Millions of dollars going into campaign funds that wind up in the office holder's account.\n\nEvery year, each Congressperson should account for every dollar that came their way, including US tax returns. And when a congressperson leaves office, they need a total disclosure of their wealth.\n\nThis thing of trading stocks is an arrow aimed at Pelosi to cover up for the fat that GOP congress people have all gotten way rich from \"donations\", and have gotten away with it.

It would need be so that conflicts of interest are prevented through internal controls that the government implements and enforces through truly unbiased regulation\u2026.

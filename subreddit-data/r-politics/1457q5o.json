In places like LA or NYC -- there's taxes to pay and your housing's expensive, generally speaking... everything is. So at 250k, it's basically akin to taking in 80k in terms of what you would actually keep. I understand this is a controversial statement. \n\nWhich means, yeah, Americans are poor. Which confirms a lot of the data on how Americans can't save money, etc.\n\nAnd that's because we vote in governments that cater to corporations rather than consumers. Over and over and over.",

Claiming his wife\u2019s million dollar competition horse as a medical expense for her MS; paying less than 8% in income tax then going back over his taxes when he decided to run for president, refiling them to massage the numbers to appear more palatable to the average Joe\u2014while lying and saying he had always paid his fair share. \n\nFighting publicly against his LaJolla neighbors to try and put a car elevator in his house and make it three stories tall, to block their views in a neighborhood where neither type of construction was allowed. The fight turned vicious primarily because he behaved like an entitled baby throwing his weight around, and got savage about it. \n\nMitt wasn\u2019t right for President then, and he isn\u2019t now. He\u2019s a walking, talking character flaw in a bad suit with a greedy desire for power. \n\nTrump too was too unethical to be President. And too stupid. Mitt, being smarter and with a nearly bottomless pit of LDS money and raised up by John Birch Society acolytes, would be far worse. We\u2019d be living in a theocracy whether Mittens or DisneyRon become President. \n\nFight hard, against them both.",

Right now they're beholden to him because he carries so much sway with their voter base, so they don't want to upset the masses. But they love having a villain to root against, and they will need to completely turn against him, call him a liar, a thief, a criminal, a scam artist, a rapist...publically, loudly and frequently, until people start to slowly latch on. Eventually he'll become a pariah. It will be painful for all of them, which i love.

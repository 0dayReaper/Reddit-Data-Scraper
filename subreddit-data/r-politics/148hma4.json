He did not disseminate, leak, or provide information to a foreign power or to a news organization to damage the country. He is not a spy. He\u2019s overcharged.\u201d\n\nIf you have to say this then there should be a clear indicator that something isn\u2019t right. Lindsay is generally full of poo shiesty but this is another level of BS. On a side note, I hope he gets indicted in Georgia and is disbarred..",

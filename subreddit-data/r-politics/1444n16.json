Reality is pretty plain and simple stuff, but somehow it's become questionable because Republican conservatives have tried to redefine the meaning.",

That\u2019s why Fox News is much worse than some other random more extreme media; their messages revealed in the Dominion Lawsuit show exactly that.  They manipulate better.  Others are better at making them look dumber and dumber with crazier stories that all contradict each other and promote more infighting.  Fox doesn\u2019t really control that either, but they can slowly steer it better.\n\nAnd also why a McConnell is much worse than a Trump.  I\u2019m afraid that in a few years people may forget the thousands of people behind the scenes who really did the legwork.  Who hate Trump more than anyone because he lacks subtlety.

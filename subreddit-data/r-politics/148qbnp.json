But no one is asking, 'why do ex-presidents get secret service details anyway'? \n\nThere's good reasons why they do  - and, equally, a reason why Presidents removed from office don't qualify for the privilege.\n\nAs a career criminal who has stolen US state secrets at the highest level (nuclear capabilities, military strategies etc) and habitually obstructed justice, there's no good argument why Mr Trump is entitled to anything from the country he was happy to sell out and betray. While not technically removed from office, he fucking well should have been - and I'd argue that inciting a coup and trying to get your loyal VP lynched is beyond anything those who drew up the Former Presidents Act could possibly have imagined in their worst nightmares. \n\nTL;DR: Trump gave up his right to ex-Presidential protection when he committed his crimes and betrayed his country, his oath of office and his duty as President.",

He'll never see the inside of a jail cell, boo fucking hoo. He's going to spend the next decade of his life tied up in court, his freedom is going to be severely restricted, and most importantly (as per his values), he's going to look like an epic loser. \n\nI'd simply be happy for his political support to plummet so we never have to deal with him again. Prison would be cool, but I can see why that is a logistical nightmare given his USSS detail. \n\nHouse arrest is more interesting than people are saying, as he wouldn't legally be allowed to reside at Mar-A-Lago. His deed agrees that no one will use it as a residence (even though he totally does right now). I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes an issue, since the indictment claims Sea-By-Lake is Trump's residence. I wonder if the city or state could sue (though Florida might be favorable towards him).",

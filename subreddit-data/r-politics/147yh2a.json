Among even a cursory examination it's absolutely obvious the federal government went WAY out of its way to NOT charge president Trump and chose to ignore dozens of obvious crimes, likely because they preferred not to embarrass the office of the president.  **Here's a list of the staggering number of serious crimes they chose to ignore**:\n\nhttps://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trumps-staggering-record-of-uncharged-crimes/",

Imagine you are running against a man who straight up lied about you(desantis) and suggested you were a closeted homosexual child molester. And now you take his side? No one is going to respect you. You should be viciously attacking him and making up lies, like that he gave nuclear secrets to Iran at maralago. Or that you finger banged Melanie and ivanka.  Over and over and over again you should lie and manipulate. But no, they go and suck his d and then turn around and wonder why he is winning. I would love to hear what desantis\u2019 campaign advisor are telling him. What is the tortured logic that they are telling him.",

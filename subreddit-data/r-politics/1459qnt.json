I used to be an appellate chief in the 11th Circuit (where Florida is) and I litigated a few appeals where we asked the court of appeals to order a judge to recuse.  \nAltho a judge's behavior in court generally doesn't form the basis for recusal, the 11th Circuit has ordered \"reassignment\" where a judge leans so heavily for a defendant they call their objectivity in the eyes of the public into question. (US v. Martin)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is persuasive authority that Judge Cannon must step aside if the case falls to her as a permanent assignment. Her court &amp; certainly the 11th won't tolerate the damage it would do to their credibility if she failed to voluntarily recuse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is not clear Cannon is permanently assigned to the case. If she is, it's extremely unlikely it stays with her and as a last resort, DOJ will challenge her participation and win.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1667166126881619969",

If it was you or I, we would have contacted an attorney after we were arrested and go from there, often with a PD lawyer representing us at arraignment unless we have family/friends/an interested party with money to retain a lawyer in the window between arrest and arraignment, but someone who knows they have criminal liability often retains a lawyer or firm to be the go between before charges are filed, to handle subpoenas and discovery and negotiating settlements before it ends up in front of a judge or jury, and even set up times for their client to surrender on their own terms instead of being walked to a squad car in cuffs. Another thing with lawyers is that they often will tell their client to tell them everything so they can formulate a legal defense to whatever charges may come and attempt to mitigate any possible consequences and investigate the likelihood of conviction if their attempts to mitigate fail, and hand over that information to another partner or firm that has courtroom experience and expertise, as pretrial defense is much different than trial defense. You have time to sit and read the law, read legal journals, read court decisions during pretrial, but during trial you need to have that stuff in front of you and in your head already, and mid trial motions function entirely differently than pretrial motions in both their scope and immediacy. The funny thing about lawyers is how few of them have extensive time in the courtroom at trial, and how many of them have never seen an actual trial at all. You've also got to think of all the different aspects of law that only involve a courtroom if something goes wrong. Basically the entirety of contract law and real estate go through offices that are only administrative and archival in nature, and only become courtroom cases when a party to the situation sues.",

Smith needs to keep it simple. This is about a President who jeopardized our national security by removing documents that were classified national defense information and extremely dangerous, and when he was caught, he covered it up,\u201d Eisen says.\n\n\n&gt;Then there\u2019s the war of public opinion, Trump\u2019s favorite battlefield. Trump has already begun trying to define Smith in public as \u201cderanged\u201d and a \u201cTrump hater.\u201d Speaking to GOP supporters at the Georgia state Republican Party convention in Columbus, Georgia on Saturday, Trump went on a rambling takedown of Jack Smith. \u201cI watched him yesterday go up and talk. He talked for about two and a half minutes. He was shaking. He was so scared. He didn\u2019t want to be there. Because ultimately, these are cowards. They\u2019re cowards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a big Trump hater, openly he\u2019s a Trump hater.\u201d\n\n&gt;But Smith is unlikely to be intimidated, Eisen says. \u201cJack Smith has tried war criminals who have committed mass atrocities. So I don\u2019t think he is going to be daunted by name calling by Trump.",

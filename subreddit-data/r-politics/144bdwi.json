            "comment": "&gt;In the scramble before the end of Texas\u2019s legislative session last week, a must-pass bill was amended to impose new costs upon renewable energy. This came amid a barrage of anti-solar and wind power measures pushed forward by Republicans to reshape a state that has become the US\u2019s powerhouse of clean energy.\n\nThese horrible Republicans - and the oil polluters that they kowtow to - are not only insanely shortsighted but absolutely suicidal in their insatiable greed. Not to mention their prioritizing profits over people, the environment and the planet, shows that they don't give a flying fuck about their own children, grandchildren,  or future generations.\n\nThe selfish fucks.",

The article shows how the UK\u2019s high electricity prices are mainly caused by its overuse of wind power, especially offshore wind, which is expensive, intermittent, and unstable. Wind power requires expensive and complex grid infrastructure, large amounts of energy storage, and special measures to balance the supply and demand. The article estimates that the UK\u2019s planned expansion of wind and solar power by 2030 will cost \u00a3232 billion and \u00a330 billion respectively, and will increase the risk of blackouts, waste, and grid collapse. The article contrasts the UK\u2019s situation with the US, which has hardly any offshore wind and plans to increase it by 2030. The article suggests that the UK and the US should build new, modern, high efficiency gas and nuclear plants instead of relying on renewables, which are unaffordable, impractical, and dangerous.",

He needs to be thoroughly investigated. \n\nAside from that the millions and millions of dollars of mail sorting equipment he trashed for NO good reason, other than I imagine helping his cronies and his piss poor attempt at voter disenfranchisement.",

Pack sought to transform the agency, which oversees the international broadcaster Voice of America, into a propaganda outlet for Trump\u2014despite a statutory mandate that prohibits such political interference. He purged the staff of VOA and its sister networks, replaced them with Trump loyalists, demanded pro-Trump coverage, and unconstitutionally punished remaining journalists who did actual reporting on the administration. **In a perverse move, he refused to renew visas for foreign reporters who covered their home countries, subjecting them to retribution by authoritarian regimes.**\n\nWow, Michael Pack sounds like a fucking shithead.  Good call on removing him.",

Yet Robb is vehemently anti-union**; during his tenure, he tried to limit employees\u2019 free speech, give managers more leeway to engage in wage theft, hobble unions\u2019 ability to collect dues, and prevent employers from helping workers organize. He also tried to seize near-total control of the agency by demoting every regional director and consolidating power in his office. If successful, this gambit would\u2019ve given him unprecedented authority to bust existing unions and prevent new ones from forming.\n\nI mean, its so far beyond parody that i'm not sure if any of it was real...",

Kraninger, who had no previous experience in consumer protection, immediately tried to undermine the agency\u2019s role as a watchdog for the financial sector. She scrapped a landmark rule that restricted predatory payday lending, pressuring staff to downplay the resulting harm to consumers. And she refused to enforce a federal law that protected military personnel against a broad range of predatory lending. Her decision yanked federal support from military families who were defrauded by lenders. In the midst of the pandemic, Kraninger also approved a rule that allows debt collectors to harass Americans with limitless texts and emails demanding repayment.\n\nWhenever someone says the president has no effect on your day to days",

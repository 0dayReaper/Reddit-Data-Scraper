I've seen a grand total of 1 postal inspector in that time (one time we had a service talk from one who went over some things - it was informative but he seemed to be a bit of a prick). How many postal inspectors are there anyway? I really don't think it's a ton.\n\nAnd while I'm a democrat and should hate DeJoy because of his Trump ties, I honestly have to admit what he's trying to do for the post office is long overdue. He's cost rural carriers like myself a ton of money but I will admit we're vastly overpaid for our work load anyway. Maybe 10 or 20 years ago, we were earning the salary with the work. But at least where I work, we have a lot of regulars making 70 to 85K a year (with okay benefits - and while that might not be enough to comfortably live on in some places - it's still fine for where I live) and only working 25-30 hours a week. Some even less than that.\n\nThe bottom line is the post office needs massive changes. And all of the postmasters before DeJoy were useless. So I wish the Democratic media blitz would ease up on the fire DeJoy campaign. He actually could help the post office's bottom line if they would allow him to also make massive changes on the city side of things as well.\n\nI don't want him manipulating election ballots, but I don't think that is happening either. A lot of the balloting decisions are done at the state level and the post office has zero input in what happens. We're just following orders.\n\nAnyway, my point is he's not the villain many are making him out to be. At least that's my opinion, and I know a lot more about what is happening inside the USPS workplace than most of you.",

So even his opposition such as  DeSantis are going to show support because it's solidarity in Republicans vs The World complex these people have. Meanwhile to a majority of us the battle looks more like Republicans vs Reality. \n\nPence and Christie, although unlikeable in their own ways, would be vastly preferable to DeSantis, Trump, Haley, Scott etc. For the Republican Presidential nominee that is. Pence and Christie would represent a shift back to sanity for the GOP. \n\nFunny enough, although I'm fairly progressive now, I am technically a registered Republican because I was indoctrinated as a kid by my father. In his defense though it wasn't exactly intentional and he has always encouraged me to vote for who I agree with most even if it's a Democrat because he believes in democracy and our country. \n\nThat said. I am not sure who I will vote for in the Republican Primary because voting for any of these people seems disgusting. I may finally just reregister.",

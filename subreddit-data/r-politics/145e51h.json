The charges appear to be due to this statute with charges stacked on top for all the ways he tried to fuck with it. It does not care about classification. \n\nHe\u2019s not being charged with mishandling classified documents (which in his presidency went from a misdemeanor to a felony go figure lol). \n\nGiven he was a classification authority, a likely argument would have been that by uttering the information (as Obama did) or taking the documents (as numerous presidents have done) that de facto declassified it. Interestingly - that argument, while it would likely exonerate Trump, would also exonerate Biden (a national classification authority while he was VP) and Hillary (a State department classification authority while she was secretary) due to EO 13526, which is still standing. \n\nThe big thing prosecution is likely to go after is proving the documents were related to national defense, AND that he deliberately made moves to prevent their return to an officer of the US Government.",

Doesn't matter if the docs in question were classified as all, the grand jury subpoenaed the documents as evidence. He not only lied about having them, he conspired to move them so that his lawyers wouldn't know he had them. That way they would unknowingly lie to a grand jury!!

There is literally no question that he did this and no way he can't be found guilty on those charges alone.",

It's clear he broke the law, and that he knew he was breaking the law. Also ordered his attorneys to lie for him and get rid of the documents once the federal investigation started.  He he were a civilian he'd already be in and prison and he'd never be seeing the outside of it.",

He kept pushing the envelope though until they came after him. The key thing I hear from Trump supporters, and I think Elon yesterday is that Trump is being unfairly prosecuted because they all do illegal shit and are let go. There is a difference here though he kept going other guys that pushed the envelope backed off. None of the rest of them are as criminal as Trump is, he's also way dumber so its easier for them to successfully prosecute him. They see biden had classified docs think its the same well Biden cooperated and even if it was malicious somehow thats the big difference, Trump kept trying to gaslight them into thinking they weren't actually illegal if he had handed them all over he would likely of avoided prosecution too.",

This isn\u2019t stupid watergate, this is on an entirely different scale.

We knew he was going to sell secrets from the very beginning, just due to the debts that we knew about.\n\nEven without those debts, his history of greed and financial irresponsibility made it clear that he would leverage anything he could regardless of the damage to enrich himself. It\u2019s so infuriating that we\u2019re sitting here in 2023 assessing the damage when it shouldn\u2019t have ever been allowed to happen in the first place.",

Let me explain:\n\nIn the \u201cDefendants\u2019 Concealment of Boxes\u201d section starting on page 21, it explains the movement of every box at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSpecifically, [on page 24 of the indictment, it says:](https://i.imgur.com/rfVyKQs.jpg)\n&gt;\tIn sum, between May 23, 2022, and June 2, 2022, before Trump Attorney 1's  review of TRUMP's boxes in the Storage Room, NAUTA--at TRUMP's direction\u2014moved approximately **64** boxes from the Storage Room **to TRUMP\u2019s residence** and **brought to the Storage Room** only approximately **30 boxes**. Neither TRUMP nor NAUTA informed Trump Attorney 1 of this information.\n\nThen, on page 26, it says: \n&gt;\tEarlier [on June 3, 2022], NAUTA and others **loaded several of TRUMP\u2019s boxes** along with other items **on aircraft that flew TRUMP and his family north (*Bedminster*) for the summer**.\n\nTHUS, on the day that Trump\u2019s lawyer searched the MAL storage room for docs, Trump directed Nauta to move 64 boxes from MAL to Trump\u2019s house. Then, a couple hours later, after supposedly \u201cpicking through them\u201d, Trump directs Nauta to move **only 30** boxes BACK to MAL. \n\nThen, the next day, after the 3rd lawyer had falsely certified that they found EVERYTHING (they didn\u2019t) and handed the documents over to 2 employees from the DOJ and FBI, respectively, Trump and Nauta **moved those extra 34 boxes on to Trump\u2019s private plane with which he took to Bedminster, NJ**. \n\nCrucially, this indictment says nothing of what happened to these boxes after! The indictment ends there and moves to the charges! \n\nThere **has** to be more (at Bedminster). No chance the DOJ just forgot about those boxes!\n\nThis leads me to believe that this is only the **first** indictment. Let us not forget that the main focus of this investigation has been centered around the D.C. grand jury. That grand jury has met for 2 years. There absolutely has to be an indictment coming from them as well. Perhaps that will cover even more serious crimes? Perhaps there\u2019s been a secret grand jury in Bedminster?\n\n**Idk but I\u2019m here for the ride and I\u2019m loving it**",

This makes me think he has a Grand Jury empaneled in NJ as well, which would track with the legal world\u2019s assumptions for why this case is being brought in SDFL: the relevant crimes and witnesses are largely in that district. It would stand to reason that, given the fact that the boxes loaded onto his plane for the summer in NJ is never touched on again in this indictment, the relevant crimes and witnesses to any criminality surrounding his handling/procurement/display of classified documents in Bedminster would be in NJ \u2014 and therefore be a second case within a separate Grand Jury in SDNJ.\n\nEdit: let\u2019s not forget that this is the summer that Ivana passed, was reportedly cremated, and had more than an average amount of pallbearers struggling with her casket that was buried on his golf course. He also made the deal with the Saudis and LIV golf (which just made big news with their merger with PGA). This whole thing stinks to high heaven.",

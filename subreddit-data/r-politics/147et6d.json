They had their assets seized *after the US began to realize how crazy Hitler was* and went on to be a senator and the father/grandfather of two of our presidents. Granted, one of these actually served in WW2, but his work in the intelligence department after was arguably suspicious.\n\nETA: the Harriman family was also involved, along with the Browns. Alex Brown Trust was bought by Deutsche Banks private wealth management division years later. The bush family is essentially the political arm of the Walker family banking dynasty that grew from their shipping business in St. Louis.

But yes, Prescott was thought to be involved in the business plot in 1934, so that was before WWII. \n\n\nThis is an extremely deep rabbit hole that has a long history and is in many ways ongoing but less thriving. Anyone over the age of 35, and somewhat politically savvy, should remember how much corrupt shit happened quietly when the GOP had its act more together/pre tea party. \n\n\nCheney, Rumsfeld, Bush Sr. (GWB isn\u2019t as smart or conniving as his father, was a puppet president like Reagan to GHWB) - these guys barely left the White House since Nixon, and when they did, profiteered in between their gigs. Oh and if Roger Stone was literally ANYWHERE, corruption followed in proximity. GWB wouldn\u2019t have won 2000 without that scum bucket. \n\nThe Walkers and Harrimans wrote the book on how to pay to play both parties against each other. Kennedy\u2019s we\u2019re too sloppy, so they got shot-y. GHWBs role in the cia was a little too close for comfort to some of that, but I find his work getting his hands dirty in central/South America a much more credible well to draw wrongdoings from.  \n\nI can\u2019t remember off the top of my head but pretty sure it was Hoovers FBI that was so wary of the CIA, to the point he was convinced Bush and his ilk were making bullets out of ice to eliminate evidence of assassinations of \u201cinconvenient\u201d government officials (aka anyone who didn\u2019t play ball w their agenda).\n\nBrown brothers Harriman is a fascinating private bank, once a client of mine, so I will say no more about them. DB PWN - well known on Wall Street that there\u2019s often a kernel of truth to even the craziest of rumors around that bank. \n\nWhat do all these have in common? Lots and lots of money laundering for cartels and the sort of banana republic fuckery our intelligence agencies pulled off in GHWBs heyday there. There was a great investigation by the UN after the financial crisis of 08 (that was buried almost immediately after it was completed) suggesting that if it were not for the bail out of US banks AND this hidden money laundering, the international financial system would have absolutely collapsed, in ways the federal reserve and worlds central banks could not have prevented.",

The core idea of radical populism is that we alone represent the people (in this case, the American people), which implies everyone else doesn't and are therefore illegitimate political actors. Of course, any rule, law, ..., that stands in the way of us doing what \"the people\" want is also illegitimate and should be discarded at will. Simply by redefining \"the people\" to just their supporters (\"the real Americans\") they explicitly reject political pluralism as well as the rule of law, and with it democracy itself.\n\nThe only reason they still call themselves democratic and pay lip service to democratic vocabulary is that radical populist movements operate on an inversion of logic, morals and meaning. People are not good or bad because of what they do. Their moral character is defined not by their actions but by their political identity. If they're one of us, they're good. If they're one of them, they are not just a political opponent but also an enemy. Since democracy and associated words have a positive emotional connotation, we are democratic and our enemies are not, regardless of the actual semantics of the words in question because we are good and they are bad. It's all perfectly logical once you buy into the initial idea that the end justifies the means and that political opposition is not just a difference of opinion but a moral flaw (hence the overlap with religious thought, where this is often explicitly the case). This process makes discussion impossible, because they effectively speak a different language where words are meaningless except to those who are also part of the movement.\n\nIn this case, they will see no contradiction. People using Nazi symbols *on our side* (and this is the important bit) can't be fascists because fascism is bad and we are good. Rather, the other side (\"antifa\") must be fascists because they are by definition bad. That could, of course, flip on its head the moment it becomes convenient to make \"fascism\" lose its negative connotation among the group, at which point they'd probably wear the label with pride while still insisting that they're saving democracy as well. Words have no meaning except to express allegiance and morality is completely defined by political identity. Within such a system, people can (and will) justify *anything* their side does, particularly when it comes to harming their enemies. This was a major component of national socialism and various other totalitarian ideologies. In this respect they only differ in how they defined the in- and out groups.",

However I also get that those people don't see this or the parties approval via silence or at best a soft rebuttal  as a problem worth with holding their vote",

Disney is associated with having a good time and in an economy that's increasingly harsh to average people, harmless escapism means a lot. Fascists trying to get people to hate Disney is a strategic mistake. \n\nHonestly, the fact that Nazis are now one with the Republicans could be turn out to be an anti-fascist wake-up call for many Americans. Sooner or later Nazis put people in concentratiin camps, force people to work as slaves and conduct mass executions. I don't think the majority of Americans would tolerate that. There would be an extraordinary backlash.",

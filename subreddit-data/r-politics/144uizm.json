From the charges he took them and didn't sell them. Hoarding seems apt.\n\n&gt;Let's say someone mishandles classified documents and puts them in an unsecure location, like a garage.  Presumably that person gets zero jail time right?  \n\nOoooh who could we be talking about? Doesn't sound like Biden personally handled those documents, unlike Trump who admitted to taking them and it's okay because he declassified them with his brain. You're well versed in these matters, I'm sure you agree that's correct.\n\nAnyway, last I saw Biden was fully cooperating with the DOJ over any \"mishandling\" unlike Trump.\n\n&gt;But if they \"hoarded\" those documents it's 3 years apparently. Which means it is the intent that matters.\n\nOver several years Birchum stole about 300 classified documents. Seemingly just to keep, not disseminate. Hoarding seems like an appropriate term. Intent is very clearly a factor there. If the DOD thought Birchum was trying to sell documents he'd be facing a much longer prison term. \n\nIf a perpetrator intended to keep documents despite orders to return them, or intended to obstruct investigations, yeah that's gonna get their dick slapped harder. \n\nYou keep trying to twist this argument in Trumps favor. You suck at it.\n\n&gt;Birchum confessed\n\nWhen caught.\n\n&gt;Whoever put classified documents in Biden's garage didn't confess. \n\nWe don't know that. We know that classified docs were found at his home/office, DOJ was notified and is investigating with Biden's cooperation. \n\n&gt;And presumably got away with it. \n\nInvestigation is ongoing. \n\n&gt;Trump isn't going to confess to hoarding documents right?  \n\nAh I see, you think you find yourself a little 'gotcha'. That's nice. No, Trump specifically took documents when leaving the White House. He's publicly tried to defend himself doing so multiple times. I'm sure you watch Fox News or whatever right-wing circle jerk shit and have seen it yourself.\n\n&gt;He will say either they were declassified\n\nHe declassified them post-presidency with his bigly brain. I'm sure you'll argue that's the proper way to declassify documents but spoiler alert: It is not.\n\n&gt;Maybe they can get Trump on that one. \n\nHoly shit, you've caught a whiff of truth.\n\n&gt;I'll admit I don't know this issue all that well\n\nI know.\n\n&gt;I started to tune it out after realizing all living presidents apparently have classified documents lying around they really shouldn't have.\n\nYeah, I'm guessing a lot of what you \"know\" about this is right-wing gaslighting. But you do you.",

There's a huge difference between accidental papers getting mixed in and willfully taking with intent. \n\nIf all 3 (Trump, Biden, and Birchum) fully cooperated and there was no evidence for willful intent I doubt any one of them would have faced legal consequences. Trump intentionally took a massive stockpile of classified materials fully knowing he needed to hand them over, then lied about having them, refused NARA and FBI requests, and refused a subpoena.

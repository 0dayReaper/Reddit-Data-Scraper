I'd say I expect this to go down in flames but state electorates have voted away/boiled down their powers to pass citizen referendums in previous ballot issues both in AZ and elsewhere, so who truly knows.",

Or they just hate Democrats so much that anything despite them like cutting off their own arm would be acceptable. They just need to ensure that enough independent voters and Democrats show up to make sure this doesn't pass.",

Last year propositions to mandate ballot propositions cover a single subject (Prop129, which would likely outlaw propositions like \"Raise taxes on X to pay for Y\") and requiring a 60% threshold for tax increases (Prop132) both passed, by 10 and 2 point margins respectively.",

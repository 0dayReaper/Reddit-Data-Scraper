Looking at you, Georgia. \n\n\nAlso,  who would have thought that the first really credible threat of jail time Trump has faced would come from something that involved READING?",

Do it and you face (entirely deserved) blowback and also let's be honest: a free Trump is not just going to quietly retire.

The power comes from dangling the pardon. He wanted various people to refuse to cooperate with prosecutors, and dangling a pardon at least sometimes worked to that end, but he could never resolve it. If he said he *wouldn't* pardon them, there would be no reason for them to take the hit for him, and they'd try to strike a deal to save themselves. If he *did* pardon them, they'd be immune from prosecution and would be unable to assert a 5A right to remain silent, so they could be compelled to testify against him, and face either obstruction or perjury charges, depending on whether they stayed silent, or lied, which would then require another pardon, etc. And that doesn't even account for possible charges for corruption for the quid pro quo of trading a pardon for silence/lies.",

Their intent? To throw a wrench in the gears of an investigation and impede the proper workings of a department within our fabulous U.S government.

TRUMP and NAUTA hid, concealed, and covered up TRUMP\u2019s ongoing possession of classified documents at the infamous Mar-a-Lago Club. But it doesn't stop there, oh no!

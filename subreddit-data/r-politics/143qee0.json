Remember the J6 committee was told by Meadows\u2019 assistant that he was going to attend in person then was convinced to only attend by phone a hotel meeting on Jan 5th involving the Proud Boys leadership. Many if not all of the Proud Boys at that meeting have been convicted of Seditious Conspiracy. Those convictions involved proving that the members planned their J6 attack in advance with a goal of overturning the election, they weren\u2019t just an angry mob. This looks like their planning included what took place in that Jan 5th meeting, which the fucking Chief of Staff attended over the phone.

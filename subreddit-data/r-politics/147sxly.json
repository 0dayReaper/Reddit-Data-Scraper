He has always been a little nutty, been generally a great guy who stands up for people. His parents were both college professors at the University of Tennessee, and his father personally intervened (as Dean of the psychology department) to make sure that my mother could continue her education by getting her PhD at UT, after I was born and moving was no longer an option. Since going to Washington he has become an absolute lunatic! This is not the Tim that used to come to our bbq\u2019s or legislate things like the roadkill bill. This is a dangerous mouthpiece of fascism that will say and do anything he can to empower fascism and please his handlers. It\u2019s sickening, especially to see it on such a personal level. I quite literally cannot wrap my head around it. He\u2019s a laughing stick to all of us now, but he seemed like such a rational actor. For all of his carhart wearing \u201cdad-gummit I\u2019m from Tennessee\u201d charades, he was born in raised in west Knoxville (the most affluent/liberal leaning area of the district) by two college professors.",

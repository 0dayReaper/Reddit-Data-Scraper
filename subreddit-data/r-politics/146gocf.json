You like your apples fresh, crisp, juicy, and bug/blemish free? Then you have to thank pesticides. Free range fruit isn't meant for humans. It's meant for animals to eat and distribute seeds to propogate the species of plant. Humans have taken actions to improve it for their use.  \n \nNow, I'm all for certain safety threshholds of what makes it into the final product, but just railing against the entire system smacks of total utter ignorance and stupidity.",

We must move to a society in which people are treated as human beings, not commodities.\n\nIf we truly care about our kids and grandchildren, if we care about the very future of our planet, we must stand up and fight back.

What Sanders should be advocating for are more Democrats in office to help pass bills as well as a push back on far right extremism so that we have moderate Republicans again that would support funding mental health.\n\nThat's the only way there is going to be regulations that correct the issues we have with capitalism too.  Country isn't going to suddenly come together and vote for a bunch of AOCs.\n\nI know Sanders is popular.  But after decades of watching and listening to him, his schtick has worn thin for me.  He is willing to say a lot of the right things but not willing to sit down and do the dirty and hard work of negotiating to actually bring legislation that will help.  Only empty words like \"revolution\" and yelling about capitalism.",

That is helpful in itself as many of our elected representatives pretend like everything is fine. He has recently reintroduced Medicare For All legislation. Each year he has gotten more support for that bill, but as you pointed out there are still not enough members of Congress who truly care about the health crisis in America.\n\nBernie is constantly fighting back against right wing extremism, and he has campaigned for many Democrats in the push to get them elected to office.\n\nAs chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee, he is working with his staff to address the mental health crisis within the current political realities we face.\n\n\u201cWe are drafting legislation to greatly increase the number of mental health providers in the country and get them into the schools and communities where they are needed most. We are also fighting for a major increase in federally funded health care clinics so that anyone in this country, regardless of income, can get the healthcare they need - including mental health services.\u201d",

But what if a family is operating within a much wider social system that does not value mentalizing and whose function depends on denying certain groups recognition of their agency and selfhood? What happens to individuals and their mentalizing capacity in societies that sanction inequality, inequity, marginalization, oppression, and persecution? In such circumstances, it may not be possible to regard representatives of social institutions -- such as teachers, judges, doctors, police, even relatives-- as trustworthy. In a cultural climate where epistemic trust has broken down, it becomes increasingly difficult for individuals to experience themselves as agentive.\n\nIn short, when institutions become less human and aware of the humans that make them up, people stop trusting the social knowledge they gather by living and stop seeing proof that they themselves matter or have any sort of control.",

If America is dealing with a mental health crisis, ask what is causing it. The answer is, in my mind, a society that is profoundly broken.\n\nWe\u2019re overworked. Underslept. Have too little time to ourselves. We struggle to find physical spaces to socialize. The online spaces are full of negativity: news and advertisements meant to enrage, demoralize, and question our worth and decisions to push a product. We live in a time of existential crisis, from rising fascism in the west to climate change on a global scale. We\u2019re more in tune with the social injustices our fellow Americans experience and a major political party works exclusively to worsen those injustices to distract from their raiding of the national economy.\n\nParanoia is a mental health disorder\u2026 *but only when they aren\u2019t actually out to get you.* The same truism applies here: America isn\u2019t merely facing a mental health crisis. America is *made* to cause a mental health crisis.",

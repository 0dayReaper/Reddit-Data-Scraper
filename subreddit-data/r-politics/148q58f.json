And Trump certainly would have used that as a pretext to seize power. \n\nBut had it gone down that way, the military would have deposed him in a matter of days if not hours. \n\nThe Joint Chiefs put out a statement in the weeks after the election, and before Jan 6, stating that their loyalty was to the Constitution, not to any one man. That's what that statement meant. That they would depose Trump if necessary.\n\nAny successful coup in the US would need the support of the military, and to get that you'd need the support of the Supreme Court.",

The vitriol and threats existed for long before J6. So much of that was ignored because a manifesto read before an act of terrorism is just free speech or empty threats or \"a joke.\"\n2. The same movement is involved. MAGA, as an ideology, is fuel to insurrection. Nothing was done to mitigate risk. \n3. The J6 participants that have been caught were punished lightly and have only become martyrs.\n4. The possibility of becoming such a martyr now has a playbook for anyone wanting to be hailed a hero.\n5. Many of these MAGA people are seeking a sense of importance and to be part of a movement and this movement has syncretized and validated all of their beliefs.\n6. Those beliefs overlap with religious zealotry and ethnic supremacy, both indicators of violence.\n7. Coordination isn't the most important indicator of terrorist violence. It is extremist belief. The Freedom Club was one person. What gave him away? His brother recognized his writing as the kind of shit he had been spewing for a long time. The kind of shit autorities are continuing to ignore from these assholes and the media is downplaying for some reason.",

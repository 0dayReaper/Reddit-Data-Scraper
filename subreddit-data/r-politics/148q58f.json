Given the number of people at the courthouse today, there aren't a lot of people now who are willing to publicly support him, so it's odd how they think they'll be able to find enough people to actually risk their own safety and freedom to defend Trump.  \n\nAnd who would they fight anyway?  Democratic voters were never interested in physical confrontations with these dummies.  \n\nThere won't be a \"war\", but I suspect that as Trump supporters get more embittered as their idol is buried further into his legal messes, they'll lash out by attacking innocent people and institutions they don't like.",

Wanna feel sick, watch this traitorous fuck want to turn this grand idea into a fascist state, with retribution and elimination of non believers. Holy fuck.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=GkXKYwoyeAw\n\n\u201cEither the Communists win and destroy America, or we destroy the Communists,\u201d the former president said in Georgia, seeming to refer to Democrats. He made similar remarks about the \u201cDeep State,\u201d using the pejorative term he uses for U.S. intelligence agencies and more broadly for any federal government bureaucrat he perceives as a political opponent. He railed against \u201cglobalists,\u201d \u201cwarmongers\u201d in government and \u201cthe sick political class that hates our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also described the Justice Department as \u201ca sick nest of people that needs to be cleaned out immediately,\u201d calling the special counsel, Jack Smith, \u201cderanged\u201d and \u201copenly a Trump hater.\u201d\n\nAnd he attacked by name Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., who is weighing criminal charges against Mr. Trump, calling her \u201ca lunatic Marxist\u201d and accusing her of ignoring violent crime and instead spending all of her time \u201cworking on getting Trump.\u201d\n\nFucking wanna be Kim Jong Un.",

As much as I and I know so many others would really like to just forget about him, I think immortalizing him as the exemplar of everything the President should not be would be more important. I want every future President to go into the White House, see Trump's mugshot, and realize their position doesn't prevent them from coming to justice in the end if they choose to act selfishly, betray the country, and break its laws.\n\nSometimes you really need to remember the big mistakes, and this is definitely one of them for America.",

What is the punishment for stealing classified nuclear weapons documents? And what\u2019s the punishment for showing them to someone? If the someone is a singular person is that better than if it was with an entire other country? Is the law delineated to differentiate between that? Is showing a fake country musician nuclear weapons plans the same crime as sharing it with another country? (I don\u2019t think trump did THIS but honestly, there\u2019s enough evidence to suggest he SHOWED HIM SOMETHING!?!?!?! So I\u2019m letting my mind wander into uncharted territories since we are in uncharted territories.)",

Trump right now is Kefka when you fight his final form that's a busted, twisted-up amalgamation of what egocentric sociopaths view themselves to be; a type of angelic, divine entity befitting that of a god.\n\nGo ahead. Go look up \"FF6 Kefka final form\" and it is a 16-bit representation of what Trump *thinks* others see him as (and what his supporters DO see him as). So yes, final form, we rounded up the whole party, we have a badass Sabin on our side, Edgar is bringing his A-game and all we gotta do is take that fucker out one last time. Don't get hit with \"Fallen-one\" and assume it's over ya gotta get up and heal the party bro! get back in and just keep casting Ultima over and over. He does go down *eventually*.\n\nAnd if ya ask me, Indictment 1 = first turn flare, indictment 2 = second turn Ultima, thus setting up the chain of Ultima's.

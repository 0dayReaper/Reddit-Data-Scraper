So here's the clarifying first sentence:\n\n&gt; The Marine Corps could be without a Senate-confirmed leader in less than a month, thanks to a Republican senator\u2019s blockade of hundreds of senior military promotions.  \n\nWell.  That's probably not great.  \n\n&gt; The open spot at the top of the Marine Corps would be the most senior example of what the Pentagon warns will be a cascading series of vacancies in the military services and major commands due to a blockade of top officers by Sen. Tommy Tuberville.  \n\nBut why.\n\n&gt; The Alabama Republican put a blanket hold on nominees this spring over the Pentagon\u2019s new policy of reimbursing troops and their family members if they travel to receive an abortion. \n\nOh right of course, sabotaging their own nation's military as some kind of culture war terrorism.   Just more of the same  \"do as we say or we'll burn all of this to the ground and take you all with us\".   Cool.  Cool.",

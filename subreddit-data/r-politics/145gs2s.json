If there really are any people in the Secret Service with even an ounce of doubt in their integrity, they need to go. The Secret Service is not supposed to be political, and if extremists like that are within its ranks (and I\u2019d bet some likely are) then the whole organization needs to be swept for security risks and bad apples. \n\nThere is already plenty of security for those agents (they literally won\u2019t even let the guys work if they have any kind of major personal vulnerability that could be exploited, like a large amount of debt.) but, there were (and are) large swaths of other agencies who were saying some terrifying things behind closed doors at their offices. Those three letter agencies (plus the SS) tend to have a disproportionate amount of republicans, some of whom were openly admitting to things like buying into QAnon conspiracies, believing that Trump did win the election, and even that J6 was a false flag. We should count ourselves lucky that there happened NOT to be one of those folks on Pence\u2019s detail that day in the Capitol. At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t have been pretty to give such a bloodthirsty crowd exactly what they wanted. Sure, they all ran away when they snapped back to reality and realized that their lives could be in danger, but if they HAD gotten what they wanted, who know what they might have done next.",

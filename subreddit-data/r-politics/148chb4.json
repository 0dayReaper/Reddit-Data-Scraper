Bragg is widely considered to be one of the worst generals in the civil war (on both sides), which is saying something because there were a lot of shitty generals in the civil war. Why would we want to name a fort after not just a confederate general, but one of the shittiest confederate generals to boot?",

There's lots of them. Named tanks after them too, but to be fair there were a lot of Union general named tanks as well.",

They finally got him his Medal of Honor a few years ago.\n\n&gt;Private Johnson and another soldier were on sentry duty at a forward outpost when they received a surprise attack from a German raiding party consisting of at least 12 soldiers. While under intense enemy fire and despite receiving significant wounds, Private Johnson mounted a brave retaliation, resulting in several enemy casualties. When his fellow soldier was badly wounded, Private Johnson prevented him from being taken prisoner by German forces. Private Johnson exposed himself to grave danger by advancing from his position to engage an enemy soldier in hand-to-hand combat. Wielding only a knife and gravely wounded himself, Private Johnson continued fighting and took his Bolo knife and stabbed it through an enemy soldier's head. Displaying great courage, Private Johnson held back the enemy force until they retreated. Private Johnson's extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.",

Many met their significant other in NC, and NC is a generally nice state to live in.

I doubt a name change will change the culture surrounding the base.\n\nOne interesting aspect of all these people trying to keep these confederate \"heroes\" statues or names where they are, is that it's actually educating me on how incompetent a lot of them really were.  The confederacy was an apparent shit show, with only a few competent leaders.\n\nIt also didn't have as much support in the south as many people imply.  They didn't have enough soldiers.  The scene in Gone With the Wind where they show all the confederate soldiers, one expert said if the south had that many soldiers, they could have actually won the war.",

The only generals I can remember being idolized were the \u201cbig three\u201d of Lee, Jackson, and Stuart, I may have heard of others, but it was generally in passing. I can honestly say, I had never looked into Gen. Bragg. His moments of military success were in the Mexican-American War, and was generally considered incompetent in the Civil War. Which, if you look at a lot of the other generals wasn\u2019t an uncommon story. In fact, both sides had a fair share of incompetence, especially early in the war. \n\nOver time, I read more, served in Iraq in the USN, got a college education, and realized that most of what I was taught about the confederacy was whitewashing at best. I wasn\u2019t upset we ripped the statues off the old capitol grounds, but they really didn\u2019t mean anything to me either. \n\nThe Bragg thing is weird and sort of felt a bit forced. Again, I really think the pushback was more about the new name being considered lame, rather than a love for Braxton Bragg, who again, I doubt many NC natives\u2014myself included\u2014could have even named prior to the whole thing. \n\nIn reality, I\u2019m not a fan of building statues to any military leaders, even objectively \u201cgood\u201d ones. Military bases, are probably the one place where such individuals can be honored, however. Braxton Bragg probably doesn\u2019t deserve any particular honor however, regardless.",

He had no social intelligence or empathy whatsoever and his men hated him.\n  \nHe wasn't even a good General.  He got rolled by Rosecrans in the Tullahoma Campaign.  He later \"won\" the Battle of Chickamauga only because he was there standing there while Longstreet did it.  After that Grant fucking demolished Bragg so badly at Chattanooga his army was routed and it effectively ended his command.\n  \nMore importantly he was a traitor to his country and to put his name on a dog park would be too much.  \n  \nIf you want to honor a General from North Carolina and you're (obviously) not particular about them being a winning General, consider Ambrose Burnside.  He was a poor General who was put in way over his head, despite his multiple refusals and earnest statements that he was unfit for higher command, but he was a genuine patriot who's men loved him and who felt keenly the weight of his mistakes and the many lives lost under his command.\n  \nSource:  Nerd",

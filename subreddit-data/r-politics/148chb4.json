Just like the monuments erected in the 20's-60's by the Daughters of the Confederacy and other such BS movements.\n\nIn their mind, better to name a base after a piss poor rebel than anyone decent, because 'fuck the decent' is basically their motto.\n\nFort Hood also comes to mind. There's lots of them. Named tanks after them too, but to be fair there were a lot of Union general named tanks as well.",

The only generals I can remember being idolized were the \u201cbig three\u201d of Lee, Jackson, and Stuart, I may have heard of others, but it was generally in passing. I can honestly say, I had never looked into Gen. Bragg. His moments of military success were in the Mexican-American War, and was generally considered incompetent in the Civil War. Which, if you look at a lot of the other generals wasn\u2019t an uncommon story. In fact, both sides had a fair share of incompetence, especially early in the war. \n\nOver time, I read more, served in Iraq in the USN, got a college education, and realized that most of what I was taught about the confederacy was whitewashing at best. I wasn\u2019t upset we ripped the statues off the old capitol grounds, but they really didn\u2019t mean anything to me either. \n\nThe Bragg thing is weird and sort of felt a bit forced. Again, I really think the pushback was more about the new name being considered lame, rather than a love for Braxton Bragg, who again, I doubt many NC natives\u2014myself included\u2014could have even named prior to the whole thing. \n\nIn reality, I\u2019m not a fan of building statues to any military leaders, even objectively \u201cgood\u201d ones. Military bases, are probably the one place where such individuals can be honored, however. Braxton Bragg probably doesn\u2019t deserve any particular honor however, regardless.",

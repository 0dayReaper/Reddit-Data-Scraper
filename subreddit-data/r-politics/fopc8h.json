If the Senate bill passes, it reduces your tax liability to $18,800, so you now expect a $2,200 refund.

Why involve your tax liability at all?\n\nEdit: I have gotten a lot of crazy answers, most of which appear to be wrong. I think this is the answer (but someone please correct if I'm wrong): They are making it a tax credit applied to this year's taxes so that you receive the $1200 with no strings attached. But instead of waiting until the end of this tax season, the IRS is sending you $1200 of your future tax refund now (simply because people need it now). This means that when it comes time to actually file your taxes for 2020, the $1200 tax credit and the $1200 the IRS already sent you will zero each other out. So it will not affect your taxable income or your refund for 2020. If they instead just cut everyone a regular check, that money would be taxable income for this year, so most of us would have to pay a small proportion of that back next April.",

Will have them on CNBC shortly. Stand by for news.\n\n&gt;**I\u2019m told that the payroll tax cut in the aid deal will be for employers only, not employees.** A Senior Administration Official says employees  would benefit from the direct cash payments and enhanced unemployment payouts, but not from the payroll tax cut.\n\n&gt;Employers would have to pay the payroll tax cut back on a staggered basis in coming years, I\u2019m told.\n\n&gt;A SAO tells me the aid to airlines will be in the form of direct grants that don\u2019t have to be paid back, but airlines must not make layoffs through a date later this year, and the government will take some equity share so taxpayers see some upside in the out years.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m told by the SAO that President Trump is aware of and did agree to the provision saying entities controlled by him can\u2019t take advantage of Treasury aid. (It is unclear to me if this provision also pertains to aid from the Federal Reserve - we\u2019re awaiting text)",

The thresholds are doubled for couples.\n\n&gt; Qualifying income levels will be based on 2019 federal tax returns, if already filed, and otherwise on 2018 returns.\n\nSource: https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/senate-deal-stimulus-checks-coronavirus/index.html",

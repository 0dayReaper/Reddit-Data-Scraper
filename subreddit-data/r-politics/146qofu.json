They are all about the \"in group vs out group\" philosophies, and ideologies of conservative minded peoples. That is, to quote F Wilhoit; \n\n*\"Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect...\"*\n\nThis base philosophy can be seen in not only much of their current political discourse where they define those \"out groups\" through series of low effort, and often thoughtless slurs, and slogans of dehumanizing nature.(Just look at their language involving LBGT issues for other reference) Discourse which is not only done intentionally in bad faith, but is based on the same mechanics as the Southern strategy era policies such as the War on drugs are. Keeping the Ehrlichman quote form above in mind alongside the point made by F. Wilhoit we can look at Southern strategy era policy development as a whole as described by Lee Atwater (R) the former chair of the republican Committee, and a Political Strategist to multiple Republican presidents etc. and one of the sources for all that shit; \n\n*\"You start out in 1954 by saying, \u201cNi''er, ni''er, ni''er.\u201d By 1968 you can\u2019t say \u201cni''er\u201d\u2014that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states\u2019 rights, and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.\u2026 \u201cWe want to cut this,\u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u201cNi''er, ni''er.\u201d\"* \n\nI edited out the racial slurs he used just in case. \n\nWhat the consequence of that in the US? Well the way war on drugs related policies are applied to say cannabis related infraction decriminalization Cannabis legalization being in play in many states Black Americans are on a national average around 4 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana related offenses than their white counterparts despite similar rates of usage/possession in communities, and having a much smaller population size over all. You get to places like Iowa that figure is over 7 times higher.",

There are several reports of chemists accidentally taking thousands and thousands of doses at once and they were never in any physical danger.  What other drug can you have a 10x overdose and be ok, much less 1000x.  Even mentally, psychedelics are safer than most people think they are.

People can get over their head with psychedelics, especially LSD....do stupid or dangerous actions with bad results.   Another negative outcome: persistent users opting out of working.  This [article on drugs in the 60s from Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/07/the-death-of-the-hippies/397739/) (great pix) alludes to that.  But to no surprise, drug policy reformers disproportionately have no problem with chronic drug users opting out of work, don't see that as a notable downside for society.",

Depending on where you are, the common species of psilocybin mushroom is probably psilocybe cyanescens, which grows in landscaping mulch.

Find someone to teach you to identify them though because there is a deadly look a like that\u2019s easy to tell apart but you have to k ow what you\u2019re looking for.  I\u2019m from south Louisiana and though we have lots of psychedelic mushrooms here, you have to trespass to pick them unlike up there in your neck of the woods.  Pretty jealous ngl.",

Supporters of drug enforcement believe that many middle and upper class people are deterred by drug laws. (Meanwhile, drug addicts are a classic \"non-deterrable\" population, to use sociological lingo.)  People in first group do not want to risk their careers, years of education, big house and cars, to felony drug convictions.  Drug enforcers also co-opted businesses to put pressure on employees to be drug-free.  There is an array of penalties to discourage hard drug use.\n\n\nIn the 70s and 80s, use of cocaine and other drugs skyrocketed among middle and upper class.  The trend was striking at the time.  It was the imposition of increased penalties, *in the opinion of drug enforcers,* that arrested that trend.  This might be supporting info:  2016 Vox article on Drugs: [The war on drugs, explained](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/8/18089368/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth)\n\n&gt;Jon Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University...estimates that legalization could lead hard drug abuse to triple, although he told me it could go much higher...\n\nLegalization being the absence of penalties.  Drug policy reformers insist there is no proof that a sizable number of would-be users has been deterred.  True that it is hard to obtain a figure.  How much higher would DUIs be if we halted all DUI enforcement? Or people poaching wildlife or cheating on taxes or dumping trash illegally?  We do not have a handle exactly how good  *crime suppression* works, but law enforcement has a high degree of confidence in significant value.  The debate will continue.",

That being the case, I believe the evidentiary bar supporting the effectiveness of the policy needs to be higher than in your comparisons. Essentially, it seems to me that restricting behavior that is not plainly immoral and harmful to others is harder to justify than punishing plainly immoral behavior, since \na penalty for behavior that harms others is justified regardless of a deterrent effect. Drug prohibition is essentially solely justified on it's deterrent effect, and the truth of that effect is of key importance. \n\nIt's also important to note that the harmful impacts of illegal drug use do not equate 1:1 to the harmful impacts that result from fully legal drug use, particularly considering the indirect harmful impacts of drug prohibition. That means that estimates of drug use under various legal regimes are not as useful as your comment suggests they are. It may be the case that even a 3X increase in drug users may still result in a net decrease in the harmful impacts due to drug use and associated behavior.",

Here is a 2010  article whose theme many drug policy reformers will like  that is useful to the debate:   [Alcohol 'more harmful than heroin' says Prof David Nutt](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11660210).  Nutt could be right, considering alcohol's big role in violence.  But Nutt also compiled a danger rating for a list of drugs. The total level of harm from all illegal drugs is 3 x the level of harm from alcohol. Say we rate  alcohol as producing 1 trillion units of harm. Booze remains legal, obviously, so total harms from full legalization will be 4 trillion units.\n\n\nAnd that's at current rates of hard drug use. What happens when meth, cocaine, and heroin become more available via legalizing or downsizing of drug enforcement? Nutt's graph also omits many drugs, and the number is still increasing:    [Tusi..or \u201cpink cocaine -- the \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d of drugs\u201d \u2013 an instantly recognizable product.](https://insightcrime.org/news/tusi-the-pink-drug-cocktail-that-tricked-latin-america/)\n\n2019: [New drug MDPV, or \u2018monkey dust\u2019, found in Australia.

If we are honest, we will acknowledge that every single drug has some harms, and  the sheer number of drugs--most have a core of enthusiasts--is causing big problems for society.   *Here is the historical argument.  It has merit:* \"We already have enough trouble with alcohol; we don't need to be legalizing more intoxicants.\"",

Consider the current issue with fentanyl overdoses. Few users are trying to buy fentanyl. They are trying to buy other drugs, but those drugs are contaminated with fentanyl and the dose is unknown. As a result, it's easy to accidentally overdose on fentanyl. Then the question is, why is fentanyl such a common drug to add into other drugs? Answer: it's very potent, and when the major constraining factor for drug distribution is getting volumes of drugs into a country, potent drugs are incentivised because 1lb of fentanyl contains many times more doses than 1lb of heroin, so it is more efficient to import the more potent drug, despite the harm to users. \n\nThis is just one example of how prohibition makes drug use more dangerous and harmful for any given user. To be sure, it may end up that legal drugs lead to more harm due to increased use, I'm just saying it's not perfectly clear cut, since the risk associated with drug use changes in a legal market.",

In 2016, I counted 38. Seven years later I've literally lost count but it's easily far into the double digits, and this is across the country, some rural, some urban, some suburban. It's a numbing feeling because in a sense I no longer know how to process the fact that someone I know and have had some sort of a friendly relationship with is suddenly dead. This started for me as a freshman in college in 2005 and the latest is one of my closest friends that I've known since about 2006, in April. Not all ODed on opiate/opioids but an overwhelming majority were before I more or less lost track. The creepier thing is that sometimes their parents would tweet or post on facebook after their passing and part of the reason why I really can't deal with facebook anymore. At least on Twitter it's such a mess that I miss so many posts. Once upon a time a lot of us were in the same IRC chat, and then as numbers dwindled, Tinychat and other sites until at some point it was just a Twitter DM groupchat with a dropping number of members. In a sense we found affinity because we were all misfits in our communities who primarily were into internet culture and felt isolated in the early aughts. Now those of us who remain are re-isolated because the unending, insidious policy that incentivizes the introduction of less safe drugs into the flow of underground commerce year after year. I can pinpoint the moment when everyone went from Oxy to heroin - in 2010 when the reformulation made Oxy unaffordable - and the day in 2016 when one batch tainted with fent killed 3 people in one go in Queens. The really dark joke is that my theme song is the Norwegian band Turbonegro's All My Friends Are Dead, off their Party Animals album. \n\nEssentially almost everyone within this circle were self-medicating. Some because their doctors stopped a prescription they needed suddenly and far too early - I had a doctor give me a week's worth of Alprazolam and told me that I'm getting cut off and I need to taper from 4mg to nothing in a week, which is effectively medical malpractice but by the time I learned that in law school the statute of limitations have passed. Not unexpectedly I had a seizure and luckily I came to in the hospital. Some were on drugs for pain either physical or psychological - MDMA is of course now recognized as treatment for it, but without a therapist willing to work with the patient while on it it only has so much utility before it becomes ineffective, or \"lose the magic\". Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed but their effectiveness plateau and jumping off back to baseline is ridiculously painful and dangerous. Some just wanted to feel good and who am I to judge? The commonality is more or less that we were all tech literate kids at one point who somehow through the grapevine found communion and then one by one dropped off. Punishment wouldn't have done anything - the vast majority of drug users are casual and disorganized anyway - but at around 2013 or so a lot of us no longer actually do drugs for various reasons, and instead we got front row seats to what is clearly an unfolding disaster that have continued for a decade. \n\nAnd the actions of the government - state and federal - have been almost cartoonishly villainous and harsh. I remember watching the AG of Oklahoma gloat on Chris Hayes' show the day Purdue Pharma was handed the judgment, and gloat with the sort of glee that made me physically sick because it had a distinct feel of dancing on the graves of so many, like a figure in a commissioned Dutch Golden Age painting, less Rembrandt but more Frans Hals. Channeling Simon Schama, he looked like a figure in a 'Merry company' painting, except with the macabre undertone that what he's celebrating is little more than a sort of scapegoating that rests atop the countless graves that came before. Is the money going to anything useful? Hell no, because such a verdict and award reinforces what I call the \"single point of failure\" model of how opioid use spread, when really opiates and later opioids have been used by subcultures and sometimes just out of sight in mainstream culture since the 1700s. It's a convenient way to ignore all of the reasons why opiates are popular and assign blame in a way that pretends like zealous and overzealous enforcement of already nonsensical laws had nothing to do with the deaths, a sort of portraiture more akin to a butcher than the Attorney General, imo. The Scots didn't introduce opium to China in the 1830s leading to war, they simply undercut the local merchants who, although operating illegally on an official basis, had enough political clout locally to see the newcomers with better goods at a lower price as a threat, in a country where international commerce was so centralized that any such importation can be viewed as a challenge to the authority of the emperor - which became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turned out. Thomas de Quincey had written about opiates in the 1820s, and Coleridge's writings, in particular those written in the 1790s, were clearly inflected with opiate-tinged imagery (in his case, likely laudanum), which de Quincey made references to. It's a matter of public record that our drug prohibition laws were a continuation of the sort of racist laws, a sort of Northern Jim Crow (but really extended across the country) that gave license to openly target various minorities. The commonality is that these laws overwhelmingly target the already marginalized. We have done so little substantively to reduce that sort of marginalization, partly because even though the medication clearly doesn't work for many, the prescription of SSRIs, SNRIs, and antipsychotics to teenagers have simply continued the timeless youthful curiosity unfettered by a sense of their own mortality and driven by the profound emptiness that comes with being the odd kid out. The sorry state of mental healthcare in the country certainly failed to provide any substantive help to many but did open up the door to psychopharmalogical means to address the issues, and it's hard to argue that at least some of the uses are actually useful and does achieve what the user sets out to do, all in spite of and not thanks to the draconian laws and the lack of realistic improvement in treatment methods. \n\nThe fact remains that most drug users don't end up OD, or if they do, don't end up dying. But the more dangerous you make what's available, the more likely the latter two would become an eventuality. I've long maintained that there were actually multiple opioid epidemics and for whatever reason only one seem to matter to those prosecuting the war - the one arising out of prescribed oxycodone - as if Lou Reed never wrote 'Heroin' and recorded the song with the Velvet Underground in 1967, alongside 'Waiting for the Man' on the same subject - as well as the one prompted by prescription Oxy in the 90s, and a separate one at around the same time when the internet enabled drug-curious communities to form. The War on Drugs targeted the subcultures more or less directly and the failure at excising it from culture - which is obviously an impossible goal and the worst sort of mid-century high modernist state planning at work - but the continued need to justify the continued existence of the constituency that is the DEA and such agencies, alongside their privileges, budgets, and general exercise of raw power made it impossible to simply stop the pointless efforts. The IG's reports on DEA misconduct alone would make for an aggravating read - believe me, I have an RSS feed set up for this sort of thing, alongside relevant notice and commentary opportunities on regulations.gov and federalregister.gov. But opiate prohibition came before the advent of the FDA as an independent agency and as matters relating to scheduling of drugs are DEA's responsibility and supersede any action the FDA can do regardless, opportunities to get agencies on the record tend to be few and far in between, although one such opportunity came in 2014 [when the DEA was forced by provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act to provide notice and commentary for rescheduling hydrocodone](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DEA-2014-0005-0588). As appropriate to my work at the time, I commented about rural access, and the DEA's official response is \n\n&gt;Scheduling determinations are based on scientific determinations regarding the substance's potential for abuse, its potential for psychological and physical dependence, and whether the substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. 21 U.S.C. 812(b). The DEA may not reschedule, or refuse to reschedule, a drug or other substance based merely on the population it is intended or approved to treat.\n\nExcept this is a bullshit answer to begin with, since 'abuse' is not a scientific term but inherently a moral and legal one, and there's so much inconsistency that goes into the DEA-FDA interplay that the determination is always a rubber stamp anyway. But imagine the galls to use \"merely\" in this context. It should be the entire mission of a public agency to provide treatment, not punitive punishment, to the population a drug is intended and approved to treat, anything else is extraneous and belies how little of a shit they give. The DEA, of course, has the prerogative to not consider rescheduling or scheduling at all in the first place, making it a strawman answer. \n\nBut in the end, that brush off was really the last substantive answer on the record. And still, all my friend are dead. Thanks for nothing, you with blood on your hands. I hope your nights are spent as Lady Macbeth attempting wash out the foul spots, but I suspect that the wasted taxpayer money makes them feel just fine.",

Both Prince and Tom Pett died because of untreated pain. Even rock stars have no access to safe treatment options. Although both were scheduled for hip transplants they were forced to self-medicate. Indeed, both DeQuincy and Coleridge also used opiates in a time they were available at the corner pharmacy. Thank you for articulating why the Sackler business bothered me. The government can now decide it has won but has won nothing as I would argue that at least their meds were unadulterated with fentanyl. The impulse that led people to abuse their meds is physiological in nature and not the fault of the latest purveyor of a substance used for centuries (however formulated). The ultimate irony of course is that those in pain or in psychological distress have doctors freely pushing them into taking antidepressants, not of course into therapy because insurance or taxpayer money won't pay for that luxury. So drugs are still the answer and drug companies still thrive.",

It has been overly used and overly prescribed for pain management, making people that never were exposed to hard drugs now dependent and after having it taken off the medication lists for pain management with zero alternatives to help those already addicted, of course you're going to see them buying from the streets even with the knowledge that the unregulated doses they get can be cut with other things, or at too high of a dose.\n\nWe need more treatment than punishment if we actually want an end to the epidemic. We need to be able to get these people into facilities for free that are well funded to deal with all the other underlying issues of the addict (trauma therapy, behavioral therapy, pain management alternatives, SUDs treatment, etc...) along with funded research on better ways to treat long term addicts that already have complicated side effects of prolonged use. \n\nIf parents and lawmakers really want to \"do everything we can, even if it doesn't work\" then stop demonizing the users or seller, and focus on the care of the user. Make it where they can be admitted after an OD, like we do for suicide attempts. Fund and regulate rehabilitation centers with actually trained addiction therapists vs just a random guy that used to use 20 years ago. Instead of focusing them on apologizing for their past behaviors, focus on what got them there in the first place, and for the love of God, HELP YOUR DAMN KIDS WHEN THEY ARE UNHAPPY. \n\nThe fact is, a lot of times addicts had shown they were seeking help for issues before using, and were ignored and tossed to the side. The only time these \"worried\" family members actually gave a damn was when the addict was already using and withering away. Rebellious teens will also be willing to try anything because going against the man is cool! So instead of marketing this as \"only bad people use\", teach kids in school that addiction is a mental disease that causes irreparable damage. And on top of all of that, start passing laws to punish child abuse. Because 46% of addicts suffered some kind of abuse in their lives, and let's be honest. The reason people use any kind of hard drug is to escape reality, as it's usually easier and cheaper than going to therapy and having to relive the memories they desperately try to forget.",

Oregon, first state in the nation to decriminalize hard drugs, gives only a ticket for possession of hard drugs.  April 2022 [Update from Oregon -- only 1% of users agree to rehab](https://apnews.com/article/health-business-europe-oregon-salem-158728e57e1d48bc957c5b907bcda5f5).\n\nAre drug policy reformers in the U.S. open to shifting to Portugal's harsher model?   Agree to setting up a national Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction?  The definition of decriminalization confuses.  In the U.S. cannabis decrim is morphing into full legalization in state after state.  Don't a lot of people opining here want *The Right to Use Hard Drugs?*",

If people knew how much cocaine to snort or mushrooms to ingest to get high without getting hurt, there would be much fewer overdoses. Lax laws for drugs are a safety net. It's why there should be monitored drug labs where people can do drugs safely. Just like there are bars where the bartender can cut you off.",

So its not comparable to what modern standard republicans are like, and the new batch of his party would just eat him alive as they would Eisenhower. Kind of like trying to compare Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt to their modern counterparts... it just doesn't work.",

It\u2019s designed to appear democratic while circumventing the will of the majority of voters in favor of a conservative minority. Conservatives have been playing on easy mode ever since the nation\u2019s inception. And it\u2019s allowed them to hold the very culture of the nation hostage, as their under represented opposition is forced further right as they continue to negotiate with an over represented conservative minority. And when the side of the political spectrum that consistently finds it self on the wrong side of history, on the side of evil, when that group is vastly over represented there\u2019s only one eventual outcome. A full dismantling of their rigged pseudo-democracy, replaced with outright authoritarianism. \n\nCA NY IL NJ\n\n80million-24%US-8%Senate\n\nND SD NE MT WY UT ID\n\n10million-3%US-14%Senate \n\nThat is not democracy. And the \u201cstates\u2019 rights/representation\u201d crowd can piss off. Frankly, that argument should have become unacceptable after it was used to justify slavery and sedition. Are we one UNITED country? Or a loose confederation of state-nations? Because if we\u2019re the former, then every citizen\u2019s vote should have the same power, everyone should get the same PROPORTIONAL representation based on population. People vote, not empty land, and sure as hell not imaginary lines around said empty land. \n\nThe Senate started this slow burn when the country was founded. The game has been rigged from start. Conservative votes literally and *legally* have more power. \n\nThe whole point of democracy is that everyone\u2019s vote counts the same, and that the side with more votes wins. The Senate consistently circumvents both of these requirements in favor of conservatives minorities. And Senate defenders will always claim it\u2019s to protect from the \u201coppression of the masses\u201d. That\u2019d be like if a group of five voted on burgers or pizza for dinner, and then the losing side cried \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You had more people on your side! We\u2019re oppressed!\u201d No, that\u2019s how democracy is *supposed* to work. \n\nThe Senate circumvents the will of the nation in favor of a conservative voting minority. It does this by design and has held our country back since day 1. It\u2019s why America doesn\u2019t have healthcare, why gun violence is so common, why workers rights are so poor, our high incarceration percentage, poor education, infrastructure, women\u2019s rights, racial discrimination. All because the Senate allows conservatives voting minorities to accomplish all that. \n\nIt caused our last civil war less than a hundred years into the nation\u2019s existence. Conservatives in the South claimed to be \u201coppressed\u201d by the North after Lincoln got the most votes and they lost they tie in the Senate regarding the issue of slavery. A Senate tie that was the only thing preserving the undeniably evil institution of slavery in America. A Senate tie that represented 18million citizens in the abolitionist states VS only 5million citizens in the slavery supporting, conservative states. A population of 5 million was able to overrule the representation of another 18 million. In a supposed democracy. Then conservatives tried their hand at sedition and forming a new government because ours wasn\u2019t rigged *enough* in their favor. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Senate that favors conservatives. It\u2019s all 3 branches of the federal government. \n\nThe other chamber of the legislative branch, the House of Representatives, the chamber that\u2019s *supposed* to give proportional representation based on population; does not. The number of House reps was capped in 1929 at 435. So not only do reps represent increasingly large populations, but large states with growing populations continue to lose representation. \n\nWY gets a rep for every 550k citizens, CA gets one for every 750k citizens. That means that if CA House votes had they same power as WY votes, their 52 reps would be 70, in a state with 35/39 million citizens living in urban areas. \n\nThen there\u2019s the second branch of the government, the Executive, the Presidency, determined by the Electoral College rather than popular vote. And that circumvention of the will of the nation, consistently allows conservatives candidates to win the election without getting more votes. In the last 23 years, the White House has been occupied by a conservative popular vote loser for 8 of those years. 12 if you include Bush winning in 04 as a popular vote losing incumbent during a war following the most devastating terrorist attack the nation has ever experienced. And those popular vote losing Presidents get to nominate Supreme Court Justices, who are then confirmed by a Senate which gives immensely more voting power and representation to conservatives. Which brings me to our 3rd branch of the federal government.",

And then confirmed by the Senate which gives 10million citizens in flyover states, nearly 2x more representation than a population of 80 million, predominantly liberal voters. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so bad that conservative votes have more power, consider some of the things they have opposed through history; democracy/independence, abolition, women\u2019s suffrage, worker rights, unions, 40hr work weeks, weekends, holidays, minimum wage, child labor restriction, workplace safety laws, parental leave, banking regulations, industrial regulations, the New Deal, desegregation, civil rights, voter rights, interracial marriage, gay marriage, protection from religious discrimination, climate action, vaccines, trans rights, elementary level science, and basic human decency. Oh, and they also wore white hoods and held massive Nazi rallies at American venues pre-war. Despite the system being rigged in their favor, conservatives consistently find themselves on the wrong side of history, on the side of evil. \n\nAnd it\u2019s because conservatism is rotten at its core. Born out of the French Revolution as a way to conserve status quos of inequality in wealth, social status and power. It was created to preserve nobility and monarch, to preserve a caste of higher class citizens. It\u2019s not a legitimate political ideology of \u201cdiffering opinion\u201d, it\u2019s a blanket ideology for evil to be done under. \n\nOh yeah, that conservative voting elite? The minority of voters? They also get a disproportionate share of the federal tax money. Rural areas are financially dependent on the tax money from blue cites. The rural areas take in more federal funds than they pay into federal taxes. And most red states follow this same model. Worse those conservative state governments cut state taxes further, knowing the federal government will bail them out. Conservative votes have more power and conservative voters get more of the money.\n\nSo yeah, this slow burn started far before any district could even be gerrymandered. Unfairness and inequality was woven into the constitution itself. If America\u2019s democracy is a ship, the Senate is a severe leak that was built into it by design. And trying to save American democracy without first removing the leak would be like trying to save a sinking ship without first removing the leak. Try all you want, eventually, ship\u2019s going down. And since this ship would require 3/4 of state legislatures to approve any leak removal, yeah, ship\u2019s going down. \n\nThe only question is, does the whole ship sink? Descending into the depths of fascism? Or do we prepare lifeboats for this inevitable disaster? Bastions of democracy allowed to survive and even thrive in pockets of the former USA. I know what I\u2019d prefer, but first we have to recognize the reality of the situation. Both in terms of how rigged the US is in favor of conservatives, and regarding how entirely unredeemable conservatism is, as a whole, as a political ideology. Maybe let the red states experience the full consequences of conservative rule, unhindered by liberal governmental competence, and without the financial handouts from blue states to bail them out from conservative economic policy.",

If someone gets one vote it would be really hard to convince party switching, so you may as well appeal to your party's crazies.\n\nIf someone walks in with 10 votes it could very easily be a game of appealing to the center, or being a fiscal conservative that's probably choice, etc",

Those courts gave us Gideon, Brown, Roe, and a host of other decisions which have improved lives and the quality of life.  Also, a fun fact is that in the last 100 years, only 2 SCOTUS courts were led by a justice appointed by a Democrat. And at least one of those courts (Stone) authored a very racist opinion in Korematsu.  \n\nThe problem nowadays is that the GOP saw that a lot of their people while politically conservative were not judicially conservative, or if they were, they'd defer to Congress or interpret the Constitution in as practical a way as possible.  This caused the rise of the Federalist Society and in a different type of conservative justice.  Today we'd not see a John Paul Stevens or even an Anthony Kennedy get appointed by _either_ side.  Before the federalist society, it was rare to get a truly partisan justice, now its even rarer to not get one.\n\nEDIT: I'm not saying the last 70 years of GOP appointed SCOTUS hasn't given bad or crap decisions, just that there have been some good ones.",

The southern strategy successfully pulled in all of the racist southerners from the democratic party over to the republicans. Prior to the Civil Rights Act, the south was both extremely racist and extremely democratic. When northern dems sponsored the CRA and brought Republicans in to pass it in a bipartisan effort, with primarily the southerners (who were democrats) voting against it, that broke the allegiance of southerners to the democratic party. The republicans saw that and successfully poached those racist southerners into the republican party.\n\nIt's not very useful to go back before that point and think that party and left/right alignment look anything like they look today. It took another 30 years for that switch to complete. So, you can look at justices appointed since the 90s and apply today's partisan logic to it to understand it, but before that point it's much more complicated.",

Other times, he just makes stuff up. He seems difficult to predict. \n\nPart of that might have to do with his clearly volatile nature that was on full display in his senate hearings. \n\nRoberts is interesting in that I really do think he\u2019s slowly becoming more liberal over time but only in the cases where he feels it reeeeeeeeally matters. He feels loyalty to his tribe and isn\u2019t ready to shed that loyalty. But when the stakes are very high and the reputation of the court itself is at stake, sometimes he sucks it up and does the right thing. Not always, obviously he didn\u2019t do that with overturning Roe. But abortion is one of those issues that I think all the conservative justices are just completely blind to all logic and reasoning on. That\u2019s why they were picked by the Federalist Society, because they had a blind hatred of abortion. All their other positions took a backseat and so now we\u2019re seeing the results being a little bit unpredictable for anything outside that one issue.",

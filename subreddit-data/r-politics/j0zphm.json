Many wealthy people don\u2019t have \u201cincome\u201d (as in salary) at all. \n\nCapital gains taxes are still filed under your personal tax return, so the $750 includes his capital gains taxes. Same thing with passive income (things like rental properties, etc). The shady things that are generally employed tend to be:\n\n1) Loss carry forwards (or just fabricating losses for tax purposes). Say you own a business and it fucking tanked during Covid, so you sold it at a loss. That loss may well be greater than all your capital gains combined for 2020. So you can take the extra loss and carry it forward to future years. This is important for middle class people who (for example) had to sell their house at a loss during the 2008 crisis, etc. It often gets abused by the wealthy, who may intentionally sell things at a loss in order to avoid tax liability on other capital gains. (But maybe they don\u2019t really sell it, they just sell it to a shell company they control. Maybe they overvalued it grossly before selling it so it looked like a loss but really wasn\u2019t). \n\n2) Putting their investments offshore, where foreign countries have more attractive tax rates. \n\nYou also talked about companies being taxed. Say I own a grocery store. The money the grocery store makes is not my money until I either 1) pay it to myself in the form of a salary (and pay income tax), or 2) sell the store (or pieces of the store in the form of shares, like Apple stock).  So even though the company makes money and is taxed, that\u2019s not my money and they\u2019re not my taxes.",

I have a LLC that is taxed as an S corp. For an s corp the business doesn't pay taxes on profits at all. The business only pays ss, medicare and unemployment taxes based on wages paid to employees. At the end of the year, profits are calculated and the profits or loss are then passed on to the owner/owners via a K-1 that they have to report and pay income taxes on their 1040(personal return). The owners can keep that money in their business, but it is technically their money that they can take out of the business at anytime as a distribution without paying any additional taxes on it since it's already been accounted for.\n\nNow C Corps do pay taxes on profits and then the owners have to pay additional taxes. As far as I understand though, if the c corp is reporting losses passed onto the owners then it's probably also not paying income taxes, only payroll taxes. Granted, I'm not a tax professional so I can't say for certain. There are also other types of taxing structures for businesses(sole proprietorship, LLC, and partnership) but I don't know anything about them.",

But Trump was not paying taxes long before Obama became president. And has continued paying next-to-nothing afterward.\n\n&gt; Trump obtained, and completed necessary donations and built infrastructure as a developer and CEO of his company to make his tax deductible.\n\nSuch as? Private golf courses, clubs, and hotels are not \"infrastructure\" and they were not funded by \"donations\".\n\n&gt; He didn't pay taxes because he supplied and provided for citizen jobs and developed a lot of infrastructure that would, will, and does pay off more money than anything you could ever comprehend of achieving in your life.\n\nThese were all for-profit ventures. You act like Trump did this to help people, or he wouldn't do it if he had to pay his fair share of taxes. Trump is adequately compensated by any profit he manages to make, less the amount he owes in taxes. I'm not seeing why Trump's business ventures entitle Trump to pay no personal income tax. There are people in jobs who decide the fate of many thousands if not millions who still pay more tax than Donald Trump.\n\n&gt; Also, does no one mention how Trump LITERALLY DOES NOT GET PAID for being the president because he made that choice?\n\nEveryone's aware he donates his salary to try and con dumb people into thinking this is a charitable venture. Trump's other revenue from being president more than compensates for this. He doubled Mar-a-Lago's membership fee from $100k to $200k right after becoming president for example. If Mar-a-Lago has more than 4 members this already exceeds his presidential salary. And it's a bunch of crooked foreign autocracies and sleazy Republican operatives trying to curry favor with him. The NYT story points out that his personal profit from Mar-a-Lago tripled since he started running for president.\n\nTo say nothing of all the govt money flowing in from rented rooms and golf carts. And that time he forced his administration to belatedly add his Doral golf course to the shortlist (and eventually select it) as a location to host the G7 before public backlash forced him to backtrack. He's a fucking crook and gullible people like you think he's selfless because he's making a public show of giving up some chump change salary.\n\n&gt; He's done way more than tens of hundreds, if not thousands of lower class, non-doer citizens in the USA combined.\n\nNo he hasn't. He inherited a shit-ton of money from his father who actually built the business. Every venture he's tried on his own has flopped completely. He's bankrupted multiple casinos at this point. The only ventures he's had that have succeeded are ones other people did or managed for him (e.g. Celebrity Apprentice, Art of the Deal) that he just slapped his name on. From reporting, the dude watches TV from like 6am-11am, does a few hours of work, and golfs at more than twice Obama's rate despite lying and telling us he would never golf or leave the White House because he'd be too busy working for us. And at least Obama had the decency to golf at Andrews AFB usually - Trump flies down to Florida at least once a week and forces us to spend untold millions transporting/securing him and his property.\n\nLiterally any nurse in the country works harder than Donald Trump and has done more good for people. To the extent that Trump helps people it is only in the course of helping himself - he hires illegal immigrant maids to clean up after him so he doesn't have to, not to \"give her a job\". And he profits by her labor. Tax it.\n\n&gt; The idea that y'all think it's in your right to bring up tax deduction, something that just about ALL corporate leaders do, as they have a right to do it and it is completely legal, to make a statement that Trump doesn't do anything for the country is complete stupidity.\n\nHe's using loss carryforwards where he claims his businesses have been losing far more money than they make. According to the NYT (and Trump) he also makes use of depreciation which uniquely benefits people in real estate. Now, he's either committing fraud here or he's a shitty businessman barely scraping by on the strength of loans and one-time windfalls. Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer, says it's fraud. The NYT also lays out questionable cases of deductions he made (e.g. paying Ivanka almost $1 million for \"consulting\" in a project that was just slapping his name on a building in Turkey).\n\nAnd you're wrong that all CEOs do it. Warren Buffett has paid federal taxes every year since 1944 and pays about 17.7%. Bill Gates says he's paid more than triple Trump's entire estimated net worth and should've paid more. Now, it might be something that a lot of CEOs do but most CEOs aren't the president. Trump promised he would raise taxes on the rich and use his knowledge of these loopholes to fix them. He didn't do that. Instead he gave [himself](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis) a tax cut and told all his rich buddies at Mar-a-Lago [\"you all just got a lot richer\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-mar-a-lago-christmas-trip/).",

But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.\n\nThis makes it sound like he paid $1 million and $4.2 million dollars in taxes in 2016 and 2017 respectively. However, the same article says that in those two years he only paid $750 in taxes.\n\nWhat is the amount that he actually paid?",

He likely paid in estimates before he received his final financial statements from his companies. \n\nSince he only owed $750, his $1 million extension payment was a $999,250 overpayment. You can elect to apply your overpayments to the following years tax instead of directly refunding it.\n\nThe same thing likely happened the following year, 2017. \n\nHe paid in because he thought he would owe more - not because of the penalty avoidance requirement - but because he was expected more in profit. \n\nHowever, this is the year that he allegedly committed sizable enough tax fraud for a real investigation. He probably overvalued his business properties he sold to show less of a gain, and overvalued properties bought (for higher depreciation). Also, one of the caviats is that the IRS allows depreciation on building improvements. It's extremely easy for him to improve his resorts and say he spent more than he did. That would be an example of more depreciation expense. \n\nHe also allegedly disguised family payouts as consulting expenses for another business deduction. \n\nAs a tax accountant, my interpretation is this - The reason for the consulting expenses was to avoid paying more in taxes (more expenses = less net income) with the knowledge that Ivanka (and others who received them) would give it back for a cut of the tax savings.\n\nIf you consider that 750k (Ivanka's supposed consulting fees) would be taxed at the 37% rate, he transferred it to her so she could use prior year NOLs (business losses) to offset the income entirely. That would result in ~ 278k in tax savings for Trump for the current year and allow him to further increase his losses for use in future years.\n\nIt's a bit complex, so I hope i explained it well enough.

Sometimes employees are granted waivers for certain positions, but It's nearly impossible to do this unless okayed before the position is accepted. If any conflict of interest arises it must be disclosed immediately.\n\nAn example would be if a member of the president's staff was serving on a nonprofit board of directors for many years prior to coming to the White House and was being paid $5,000 annually for their position like every other member, and this was unrelated to their White House job. This case would require an individual waiver. The B.O.D compensation is a highly debated topic. If unpaid, a waiver is more likely to be granted and they can serve without financial interest.\n\nThe problem here lies in the fact that it is the president's own company in which he still holds financial interest. If she was NOT an advisor to Trump (not a Gov't employee), she would have to perform at a rate that is consistent with the service cost and that anyone else in the profession would do - which 750k is extremely egregious for any standalone service in Trump's \"former\" industry. This would currently apply to Don Jr. or Eric if they weren't running the company (hypothetical).\n\nHowever, Ivanka was an advisor at the time in 2017 the supposed fees were paid. If true, that is a direct violation of her employment under federal employee guidelines. This payment breaks the federal employment contract she signed and violates both executive policy and federal employment laws.\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/2635.702\n\nIt is absolutely illegal and will have huge ramifications if proven. I'm wondering what date the \"consulting\" payment was made and if it was intentionally done before she received the official government clearances.",

They easily violate the tax code for employer payroll obligations. They may also cross the line from deceitful tax conduct to outright tax fraud by Trump (and many others) himself(themselves).\n\n It violates the terms of an employer to pay a W-2 employee as a consultant. The employer would be violating employment laws by not covering the employer portion of Social Security tax (6.2%) and Medicare tax (1.45%). \n\nAnd that's just the up-front illegality. This would result in a shit load of back taxes for the Trump company. No criminal charges if that was standalone. Many companies try to pass off W-2 employees as independent contractors, which is a grey area. Ivanka was already an employee - which means she can't receive a 1099-MISC for services performed as an independent contractor in addition to her (W-2) salary. \n\nHowever, what I am elaborating on is that this goes far beyond payroll tax fraud and payroll backtaxes. \n\nIf these \"contracting fees\" were payments to family and friends for the purpose of tax avoidance and can be proven - this goes far beyond the business entity level - this would lead to indictments on serious tax fraud charges. \n\nBernie Madoff faced 40 years alone for his tax fraud charges (a lot more for others). It's not unreasonable to say that if any of what I'm speculating is proven Trump could face the rest of his life in prison. Ivanka would probably face jail time as well.",

Honestly, this doesn't seem crazy illegal or out of the ordinary, Trump paying so little in income taxes in 2016 and 2017. What does seem crazy illegal or out of the ordinary is lots of other stuff Trump has done, including threatening Ukraine to not give military aid if the Ukrainian president did not investigate Joe Biden's son's business dealings in Ukraine.",

            "comment": "For those wondering what this actually means - to begin with, here is something I wrote about Trump's tax situation a long, long time ago when there was a supposed leak showing some business losses:\n\n&gt;Tax guy here. Depreciation is a personal favorite of Trump (and most big businessmen). His tax reform included a provision allowing for 100% bonus depreciation, meaning that a business can essentially write off or expense 100% of the cost of an asset in the year of purchase rather than depreciate it over time, which is the whole concept of depreciation - to take the tax benefit over the useful life of the asset. There were already several mechanisms in the tax code for accelerating depreciation before Trump's plan - section 179 depreciation and limited bonus depreciation. It is possible for big businesses to run consistent losses by expanding rapidly and expensing costs up front - see Amazon's $0 in tax paid for 2018.\n\n&gt;All of that being said, I would expect to see some income being picked up somewhere here. Even in the 80s and 90s as his brand was expanding, Trump was not building enough to be writing off billions due to depreciation alone. His interest expense was high, meaning much of his operating cash was likely coming from loans and not actual operating income. I obviously have not seen all the details but this pattern of losses is indicative of a business with serious leverage and liquidity issues. There is a reason so many of the entities he was operating at this time were bankrupted.\n\n&gt;I frankly don't really care about Trump's business acumen. Seeing high level figures like this gives us an idea of how his businesses were operating (poorly, it would appear, but there is no way to say for sure), but that's not why his tax returns for the years in question are of interest to an oversight commitee. They, and I, are much more interested in his returns from this decade, and it's not because they want to prove he is poor or a fraud.\n\n&gt;This is a man who has been deeply in debt for a very long time. How much debt he is in today relative to his actual worth would not be of so much interest to the public if his actions did not make it seem as if he is beholden to some entity or power other than the public. His personal embarrassment over perhaps not being as wealthy as he has been projecting for decades is more important to him than our confidence in our executive branch. And that really sucks. \n\n&gt;I don't want to see Trump's personal tax return so I can mock him. I want to see the balance sheets for every entity he owns. I want to see the liabilities. Tax returns alone do not tell the whole story either, but seeing several consecutive years of returns would be telling. It is Congresses job to oversee and thereby maintain public confidence in the executive. His reticence to allow them to perform that crucial function is the reason his tax returns are still in the news every day. I just want to know if my president is actually working for me, and he is throwing up barriers to us knowing that for certain at every turn. I want a president who complies with Congress even when it costs him something personally. That's the job Trump has, the job he wanted. He needs to just do it.\n\nA year and a half or so later, we are finally seeing some information about his *personal income tax return*, a form 1040, the same that you and I and virtually everyone else files on an annual basis. So what can we actually surmise from the information that has come to light today?\n\nCan we say for certain that Trump is guilty of *tax evasion* and not just *tax avoidance*? No, we cannot say that for certain, at least I'm not comfortable doing so without seeing the forms with my own eyes and, more importantly, seeing the tax returns for all the entities that Trump owns (the income and losses from most of which, despite what people are saying elsewhere, *should* be reported on his 1040). The vast majority of his *tax avoidance* would be done on the business returns, as would, if it were occurring, probably all *tax evasion*. Most Trump companies are privately held and the vast majority, I imagine, are formed as partnerships and S-corporations which provide some specific tax advantages to a business owner that I can't get into in great detail here. Each of these companies should issue, on an annual basis, a form K-1 to all people and entities that own a percentage of them. The K-1 reports several different types of income or loss, all of which is totaled up on Form 1040 Schedule E, and taxes are levied on the balance of income reported. For people that own a lot of businesses, as Trump does, it can get complicated rather quickly. The complexity of the tax code is a feature, and not a bug. There are people in my profession who are paid tremendous amounts of money to find *legal* ways for business owners to report the smallest amount of income and therefore pay the least amount in tax possible. Very wealthy people and corporations *can* have years in which they pay no income tax without being guilty of fraud. It's possible. I don't have enough information here to say for certain that Trump's returns are fraudulent. I wouldn't stake my status as a professional on such claims, in any case.\n\nAll of that being said, is it *likely* that Trump legitimately avoided paying any income tax at all over most years in a decade and a half while supposedly owning and operating multiple enormous, profitable businesses? I would likewise not stake my status as a professional on such a claim. There are, unfortunately, tremendously powerful legitimate tax avoidance mechanisms available to the ultra wealthy. That's true. Yet that does not mean that people who see a problem here are ignorant to how taxation works or are simply seeking to politicise something meaningless to attack Trump. Profitable businesses and individuals pay income taxes *eventually*. It often is not on the schedule or in the amount that seems fair to the average person who works for a daily wage, but even within a system that affords them many advantages, wealthy people aren't meant to get out of paying taxes entirely.\n\nSo, what about the debt? This is by far the most important question, one I asked in my original post a long time ago, and one which remains unanswered. To whom does Trump owe money? We won't get those answers from his 1040. There is much more to be learned and understood before we can draw actionable conclusions about precisely how troubled we all ought to be, but I don't think it at all unreasonable to be troubled right now. Our president is in a tremendous amount of debt to *someone*, and that's a bigger problem to me by far than whatever debt he *might* owe the rest of us by way of fraudulent avoiding taxes, if he's done so. \n\nYou are not stupid for thinking this is something important. You don't need to possess an intricate working knowledge of the tax code or tax procedure to be bothered by your president not reporting taxable income. You don't have to be an expert on cash flows or capital gains or property taxes to think it is a problem that the wealthiest Americans avoid and perhaps at time evade income taxes while you pay them regularly. The people making those excuses often don't understand any of this any better than you.\n\nSo, don't go light up Twitter telling everyone you are *certain* that Trump is a fraud and a tax cheat. We can't definitively say that today. What we can say is that we have a tax system that is unnecessarily complicated and works too often to the advantage of the few and to the detriment of the many. True, sensible, progressive income taxation without the back doors and loopholes would help the American people as a whole. We don't have such a system and likely won't in the near future, and that is *not your fault*.\n\nGo on ahead and be bothered by the depressingly low bottom line income tax assessment you are seeing here. It's immoral. Be bothered by the debt. It's troubling. And don't take shit from people who will try to shout you down for not being tax experts. You don't have to know all of this super well to be legitimately bothered by what we learned today.",

That's YOUR job and you should know it. \n\nI would have no argument about getting rid of tax loopholes so that this can't happen, but as it is, it can and everyone takes advantage of it to the extent they can. See Amazon and Zuckerberg tax strategies for example.",

Vote out as many right wingers and republicans as we can in all local and state elections. From the school board to the white house every seat we take is one less seat the GOP has to help Trump. Remember the primaries for these races as well. Vote out the republicans and if needed primary our uncooperative democrats. Vote every chance you get.",

Basically a combination of buying and renovating multiple casinos that competed with one another, using high interest junk bonds to fund them, and a downturn in Atlantic City gambling revenue at the time. On top of this he was shifting millions of his personal debt into the casinos, basically extracting whatever money he could out of them at the expense of the businesses and investors. So the usual Trump MO of screwing over everyone else to benefit himself",

Trump absolutely cannot plead ignorance, and that's the point. So i completely agree with you here.",

That he was the one who  \ndeleted all of her emails , the 30,000 emails, because they basically  \ndealt with her scheduling and her going to the gym and her having  \nbeautyappointments.

HRC remains in control of his brain to this day. The level of ownership she has is amazing and his level of delusion is equally so. I could argue that the reason for his theft is totally him wanting to be able to control the narrative regarding HRC.",

Trump's federal indictment contains 31 charges of \"Willful retention of national defense information\" under the Espionage Act, 3 counts of \"Withholding or concealing documents in a federal investigation\", 2 counts of \"False statements\", and 1 count of \"Conspiracy to obstruct justice\". As you can see, none of those counts are related to the increased penalty for mishandling classified documents under the Foreign Intelligence Surveilance Act that Trump signed into law. The article tries to talk around this by saying \"We don't know what statutes Trump will be charged under, but the wording of the indictment comes pretty close to the classified documents statutes under FISA, so he could be charged under that\", and that is, as far as I can tell, a false statement from someone who doesn't understand the indictment or the legal intricacies surrounding it. The document crimes he's been charged for are under the Espionage Act, that's not disputed by any legitimate legal commentator.\n\nEdit: Actually, reading the article more closely, this was posted at noon on Friday, before the indictment had been made public, which the article notes explicitly (\"details of the indictment remain sealed\"). So it's not a shameful lack of research that makes this article wrong; it's just out of date.",

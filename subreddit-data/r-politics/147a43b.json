They have to police illegal content or they could be held liable.\n\nAn argument can be made that _at best_ Reddit is negligent because it is so large and defers most moderation to users so it isn't as involved in awareness of content posted to their platform as one would like them to be. \n\nReddit only takes action IF they are made aware of the content - either through Reddit oversight or user submitted reports. If the content is in a niche subreddit with clandestine users all seeking the same illegal content, awareness of the illegal content may take some time. \n\nThe repost issue that the plaintiff argues is absolutely a product of the platform and it's moderators abiding by reposts because it creates too much value for the platform (traffic) and the user (karma). Reddit doesn't have robust enough tools in place to moderate user-submitted reposts of content. They may be able to filter out reposts of links, but not uploads (reuploads) of video or user-ripped and re-uploaded content.",

But dating platforms, including Match Group, have successfully invoked Section 230 to deflect lawsuits claiming negligence for incidents involving users harmed by other users, including victims of sexual assault. Often, judges dismiss cases before an aggrieved party can even obtain information about the company\u2019s response to the assault. One result of this obstacle is that very few civil suits have been filed against online dating companies seeking to hold them liable for harm suffered by users.\n\nChild porn is criminal.",

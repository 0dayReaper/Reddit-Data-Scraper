The two parties deferred hugely on domestic things, but with some exceptions, everyone, Lindsey included, were committed to national security.\"\"Now, with the GOP being an autocratic party in the service of Trump, who is allied with people who want to bring the United States down -- I'm going to say this carefully -- the GOP no longer, and I'm referring to Putin, no longer has the same understanding or commitment to national security and we can see many things going on in that light,\" she continued.\"**It's not just that the documents that Trump had put our nation at risk, it's that this party, which is backing him, now does not have the national security and safety of our country as its main objective**, because they are allied with people like Putin who want to take us down,\" she added.",

Graham knows that being in Trump's good graces are vital to keeping him in power, so he'll remain his lapdog until it's in his best interest to not be \n\nOr\n\nTrump has knowledge of Grahams business dealings and is funneling him information to help Graham make lots of money.\n\nBut what I want to to think...\n\nTrump knows that Graham is gay or that he had favors provided to him by Epstein. Knowing the GOP's hypocrisy, this one would be my go to.",

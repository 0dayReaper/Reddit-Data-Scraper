He wanted to continue cosplaying as President and be able to show off the secret, important things that he has. The indictment is full of examples of him showing them off.\n\nTrump has the emotional intelligence of a 3-7 year old, and his life philosophy can be summed up in the two popular phrases of that age group: \"look at me!\" and \"mine!\"",

Because, lordy, there are tapes.\n\nOther than that, no, he's emotionally and intellectually stunted and has thusfar used money, celebrity, and most recently political immunity to skirt consequences.",

If he tells Iran he has info to sell them, but then can't find it because it is split into 3 parts in different states... that doesn't work.  He needs the info organized into something people want.\n\nI see a world where Trump is more petty than most imagine and simply refused to give them back because the NARA wanted them and he was supposed to do it; basically just a petulant child but with the nation's secrets.  That is why they are just scattered around, he doesn't care about them, he just cares that Biden cares about them.",

It doesn't make sense at all, which is why Trump being a mastermind of international espionage doesn't make sense.\n\nIf Trump is a mastermind then retaining the documents is *only* a liability for the exact reason we saw - the government seized the documents from him.  There is no benefit to holding onto the documents *especially* when he was given the ability to return them without charges.  He would want those documents in a vault to ensure random people didn't go \"Hey, look at all these classified documents in this closet.\"\n\nIt makes more sense if Trump is a petulant idiot who horded documents to feel powerful.  It explains why he willfully retained them and why they are spread out at all over the place in insecure locations - there was no master plan.",

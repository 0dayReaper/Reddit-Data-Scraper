If he tells Iran he has info to sell them, but then can't find it because it is split into 3 parts in different states... that doesn't work.  He needs the info organized into something people want.\n\nI see a world where Trump is more petty than most imagine and simply refused to give them back because the NARA wanted them and he was supposed to do it; basically just a petulant child but with the nation's secrets.  That is why they are just scattered around, he doesn't care about them, he just cares that Biden cares about them.",

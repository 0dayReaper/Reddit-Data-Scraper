Hey there Frank, Mr. Big Shot Real Estate agent, not as big as me of course; we all know I'm the biggest, want to see some cool secret things? Pull up a chair, say some nice things about me. Do you know I'm currently being railroaded by the corrupt Biden crime family? Did you know about boxes in Chinatown and paper thin garage doors? I know you don't. I of course know. Me and the great Mike Lindell. The great pillow and ex-crack addict man Mikey Linnell. Some people call him Mr. Pillow, just like Mr. Plow. Remember Mr. Plow? That's when the Simpsons were great. No more (long pause) no more... But you know what's great Frank? Nuclear secrets. Big, wonderful nuclear. The nuclear is coming back....\n\n*This somehow goes on for another 3 hours*",

He is also on tape telling attorneys to break the law. Directed staff to move files to skirt a subpoena.

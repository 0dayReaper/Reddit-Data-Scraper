That is about 83,000 people per month. However it is estimated that just about 1/2 of illegal immigrants cross the border illegally; the other half come here legally and just overstay. So that means the 38,400 number is more or less in line with historical trends.\n\nCompared to a US population of 280 million people - this is about four-tenths of one percent of our total population. \n\nWhat you have to realize is that there is no \"border crisis\". This is made up by Fox News and the conservative media because it gets people riled up. We don't have \"open borders\". Yes, people cross the borders, and have been doing so for decades. But this problem is not the \"crisis\" that it has been made out to be. The best solution would be to provide more legal paths for the people who want to come here. Currently, it is nearly impossible for non-professionals without family members here to legally immigrate to the US from Mexico or other Central/South American countries. There is no \"line\" to get into, it simply doesn't exist - immigration is reserved for family members only.",

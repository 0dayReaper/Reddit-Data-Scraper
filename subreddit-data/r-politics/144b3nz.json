I would bet money that it was moved because of Florida's hostile political landscape. There was a diverse community at the event last year and it was clear that the organizers were fostering an inclusive environment. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples like this of people/events avoiding the toxic environment in Florida which don't get any press coverage but I'm confident that collectively there will be a noticeable impact on their economy.",

A single convention can bring thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of people to the area. If they\u2019re not local, that means needing hotels to stay in. Restaurants to get meals at. Rental cars. Extra fun like going to theme parks, bars, or other attractions after hours. A lot of money generated in a lot of different areas for both businesses and tax revenue that disappears.\n\n\nIt can really have a negative trickle effect across the whole economy.\n\nI hope more conventions start to pull out of Florida",

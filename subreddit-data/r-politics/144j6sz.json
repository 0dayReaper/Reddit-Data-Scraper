That being said, though, I voted against Trump in 2016 and 2020. However, It's pretty obvious the left is barreling toward authoritarianism, and it's scary. Ya'll love to call people on the right extremist, when in reality they held onto largely the same beliefs for decades, and on average have shifted to the left in several issues while the left-wing is speedrunning as far left as they can. The right isn't the side pushing for radical changes that challenge political and societal norms. By definition they can't be extremist.",

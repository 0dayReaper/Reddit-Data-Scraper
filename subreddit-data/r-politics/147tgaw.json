This is extremely important for the health of the nation in the future.  He brought this upon himself given his behavior throughout this saga.  Let's pause all the nonsensical debate about the documents, classification and the like.  How can one rationalize the blatant lying and obstruction of justice?  For this **alone** Trump must be punished.  But when you bring back into the picture the PRA and document handling, it is **imperative** that he be punished because of his refusal to defer to the authorities and cooperate in order to be brought into compliance.  Again... this is required for the future not for vengeance.\n\nNext, regarding Trump as a leading candidate... oh boy.  This is exactly like Clinton and her email server.  It demanded investigation then but did not lead to indictment.  This drama now demanded investigation and did lead to an indictment.  Ignoring the reasons here, in both cases a very strong argument can be made that it is absolutely in the public interest that these sorts of things be publicized (and in this case prosecuted) because the political election process is a job hiring process.  Why would we not want to get to the bottom of these sorts of things as we decide who to hire?\n\nLet us please dispense with this nonsense of pretending this is anything like jailing your political opponents to neuter the opposition.  There is not one single thing stopping the opposition party here from selecting some other nominee not under investigation/prosecution.",

So, either you think he's not powerful enough to avoid charges and they should continue, or you want them dropped because he's a Republican. Which are you? Someone who believes powerful people are above the law, or someone who believes all Republicans are above the law?",

He of course doesn't mention the fact that Trump is charged with several counts of lying to investigators, conspiring to prevent investigators from finding these classified documents. He doesn't mention what the classified documents are, trying to pretend that they're not serious secrets. He flippantly mentions the fact that Trump provided documents to people who should not have them as if this is some sort of minor thing. He then pretends that it will be judges who decide whether Trump is guilty or not, trying to take all of the jury's agency. And to top everything off he pretends that he actually isn't a fan of Trump when that clearly is bs.",

All he needs to do is give a single name or a tidbit of info and a foreign power would know who was compromised. I suspect he released information like this while president for his own gain.\n\nThere's really no end to the damage an unscrupulous person like Trump can still do to the country. It's a horror show.",

Remember that Trump *always* accuses others of his own worst crimes, then read this:\n\n&gt;Hillary and Biden were not Indicted. Hillary destroyed 33,000 emails with BleachBit, and smashed her phones with a hammer. Biden was even worse, but they didn\u2019t get Indicted and, unlike them, **I never gave a foreign power anything. Biden probably did. He gave to China because China gave him a lot of money?**\n\nI bolded the part that made my eyes widen when I first read it. So, this is Trump accusing Biden of giving intel to China for money. If this projection, yikes. Also: note how the goalposts have moved from \"I didn't have the documents\" to \"I never gave anything to a foreign power\" now. I wonder where they'll be moved to next.",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's been admitted officially now hasn't it? It's not just a well known secret.\n\nThat said, you make a good point that they don't ever admit it, but I think it wouldn't be because of the relationship. The intelligence community probably doesn't want our enemies to know that if you want our nuclear secrets, the Saudis could sell them to you. Or if Trump is reelected, that he will definitely sell secrets to the highest bidder.",

Instead it is incompetence.\n\nI am not trying to minimize the gravity of the charges, nor to trivialize the relative laws.  Nor do I wish to exonerate Trump in any way.  Lastly, I recognize the *possibility* of larger schemes.\n\nBut the indictment focuses on none of these tantalizing possibilities and arguably only tosses in the anecdotes about sharing documents to underscore cognizance or guilt relative to the charges about the unlawful retention.\n\nTo me, what this indictment highlights is Trump's astounding incompetence.\n\nI don't own a mansion or several.  But I personally could have handled storage better of dozens of boxes.\n\nAll of this seems to stem from not much more than:\n\n* Trump's incompetent handling of anything and everything during his tenure.  He hoarded things in a bizarre fashion.  The problems starts there.  I do not think this relied upon any specific scheme or plan.  Instead, I think Trump just stuffed things away like a squirrel with any vague idea that something might be valuable later... but more in the sense of impressing people or stroking his own narcissistic ego.\n* Trump's flagrant chaotic disorganization.\n* Trump's astoundingly embarrassing lack of management skills of any kind whereby he could have orchestrated proper handling of \"dozens of boxes\".\n* Trump's perverse micro-management of minutia he deems important and inability to find, employ and rely on competent folk.\n\nThe thing that sums it best to me is not why he kept secret documents... but why he *returned* any.  My answer after reading the indictment is that is quite possible he didn't know what was in the boxes he returned.  Or at the very least he did not appreciate the gravity of retention of those documents and what it would trigger when he returned them.  His awareness of the import of this only came later.\n\nInstead, the picture I get was someone who kept deferring any real work involved with is PRA obligations and responsibilities.  It seems plausible all he was trying to do was determine how many boxes being returned would satisfy people so they'd leave him alone.  His own people couldn't get him to sit down and rummage through things to organize stuff.\n\nThis isn't (yet) a story of some deep dark conspiracy.  So far, there's nothing remotely close to Blagojevich purposely selling a Senate seat.\n\nIt's not that Republicans should be ashamed for having elected a spy or a traitor.  The issue is that Republicans should be ashamed for having chosen someone (and continuing to support someone) who was and is so demonstrably unfit for service.",

And his \u201ccollection\u201d of other things is just as disorganized. It absolutely makes sense that he stole bits and pieces that caught his eye, and thought he could use. People forget how close David Pecker was, and the business he was in. Trump is probably a professional dirt collector. \n\nI still wonder if all this was because of Obama\u2019s outgoing letter, or Kim\u2019s \u201clove letters\u201d not being found or returned when specifically requested, because they simply couldn\u2019t find them, or do they know they\u2019re buried somewhere on a golf course.",

DOJ Jan. 6 charges still pending.\n\nThis potentially puts the GOP frontrunner facing FOUR criminal trials at the state and federal level under four different jurisdictions. Short of being convicted of specific law codes, nothing legally stops him from running or taking office.\n\nThe GOP primaries begin in February. Most are done in March. Trump will threaten 3rd party if Republicans try to oust him in any way.\n\nThe 2024 election is going to be, uh.. interesting.",

That's fucking hilarious.\n\nEdit: They're now reporting that it's no contact **about the case** which is very different, and actually rather hard to police, especially given Trump's standard mob-style talk. I'm sure he'll constantly cross that line, and not get in nearly as much trouble for it as he should.",

Already, the Republican candidates are testing the waters of defiance in a move to wrest the party from Mr. Trump's hands (if not the most virulent of the base).\n\nThis is the test case. And our obligation--every voter, all of us, no divisions on this--is to make sure that in this rebrand, rethink, replatform, tonal and thematic change that they're going to undergo? That the albatross of their behavior and words for the last half dozen years and, particularly, their defenses and handwaving of this man's alleged criminal behavior (and demonization of our public institutions) hangs around their neck for life.\n\nFor. Life.\n\nIt's not the 1980's anymore. Can't vanish for a bit and come back to a nation that has forgotten the shit you did. The internet is rich, multi-media, and forever. No more Ollie Norths. No more gaslighting the history.\n\nAs we see names tied to this historic event--Republicans in office--let's make the most comprehensive note for ourselves and each other of those that (1) said absolutely nothing and are cowards, (2) lied about the indictment in any way, (3) ran absurd interference for him, (4) acted as his PR team, (5) repeated even one of his falsehoods, (6) attacked this investigation as anything other than methodical and legally justified, and/or (7) suggested that Mr. Trump--at all--either is or should be above the law.\n\nGeorgia is coming.\n\nJanuary 6th is coming.\n\nContempt for the conmen, compassion for the conned--but, the conned are going to have to face reality at some point soon and have a lot (a whole damn lot) to be ashamed of.",

Like The Mar-a-Lago Club, after **TRUMP**'s presidency, The Bedminster Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession, review, display, or discussion of classified documents.\n\nSo DOJ claims Trump moved boxes of documents to Bedminster, but there's no further info in the indictment about those documents. To our knowledge, the FBI has not raided Bedminster or retrieved documents from there, only Mar-a-Lago.\n\nItems 14a and b (page 3) say that it's at Bedminster that Trump showed a \"plan of attack\" to a writer, a publisher, and two members of his staff, and then later showed a military-related map to a member of his PAC. These events occurred in July and August/September 2021, **after** Trump brought documents there from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPutting two and two together, the DOJ is saying that Trump had military materials at Bedminster, and it doesn't claim to have recovered anything from there. So as far as we know, Trump still has those docs.",

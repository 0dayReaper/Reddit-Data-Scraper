No more gaslighting the history.\n\nAs we see names tied to this historic event--Republicans in office--let's make the most comprehensive note for ourselves and each other of those that (1) said absolutely nothing and are cowards, (2) lied about the indictment in any way, (3) ran absurd interference for him, (4) acted as his PR team, (5) repeated even one of his falsehoods, (6) attacked this investigation as anything other than methodical and legally justified, and/or (7) suggested that Mr. Trump--at all--either is or should be above the law.\n\nGeorgia is coming.\n\nJanuary 6th is coming.\n\nContempt for the conmen, compassion for the conned--but, the conned are going to have to face reality at some point soon and have a lot (a whole damn lot) to be ashamed of.",

Trump has done far, far worse and gone largely (legally) unpunished for it.\n\nHowever...\n\nI would argue that the political punishment being dumped upon the Republican Party since the moment of his election is honestly far more damaging for them in a long-term sense.  They've acted so cowardly allowing their party to be driven further and further right that they are significantly diminishing their chances of winning popular general elections.  Sure they will try their fascist bullshit, but all of those attempts we have seen so far are more flaccid than fascist.  \n\nI want Trump to face justice as much as anyone else here does, but I also think the albatross of Trump hanging on their neck through 2023-2024 is a net negative for the GOP, from a purely political perspective.",

Like The Mar-a-Lago Club, after **TRUMP**'s presidency, The Bedminster Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession, review, display, or discussion of classified documents.\n\nSo DOJ claims Trump moved boxes of documents to Bedminster, but there's no further info in the indictment about those documents. To our knowledge, the FBI has not raided Bedminster or retrieved documents from there, only Mar-a-Lago.\n\nItems 14a and b (page 3) say that it's at Bedminster that Trump showed a \"plan of attack\" to a writer, a publisher, and two members of his staff, and then later showed a military-related map to a member of his PAC. These events occurred in July and August/September 2021, **after** Trump brought documents there from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPutting two and two together, the DOJ is saying that Trump had military materials at Bedminster, and it doesn't claim to have recovered anything from there. So as far as we know, Trump still has those docs.",

It's fucking mad.\n\nI mean, conservatives tend to conflate persecution and holding people accountable who have traditionally evaded accountability, it's delusional.

I really hope people don't use this to lie to other scared trans people that this administration isn't very pro LGBT rights. Sometimes you gotta read the room, ie not potentially flash the president",

No shirt, no shoes, no service.\n\nI don't think this has much to do with the actual showing of chest, but more the nature in which it was done. It may not have been vulgar, but it was deliberately done to thumb their noses at conventions, perhaps even antagonistically.\n\nIf you're going to defy conventions, like keeping your shirt on at the White House, then you might have to suffer repercussions, like never getting invited back.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I adamantly declined). \n\nI appreciate that more and more folks are living their trans selves.

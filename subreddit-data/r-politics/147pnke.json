            "comment": "&gt;As the indictments pile up, it's more necessary than ever to remind ourselves that the current crop of conservative lawmakers and other elected Republican flotsam is playing for far more than that, and that they're playing for it all, and that it doesn't matter if El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago finally runs into that bucket of KFC with his name on it. The project will go on because, by now, the Republican Party is a merciless, mindless machine whose primary functions are destruction and revenge. For example, take the latest attempt to use the power of Congress to protect the party's right to peddle dangerous political bunco. From the Washington Post:  \n\\&gt;The push caps years of pressure from conservative activists who have harangued such academics online and in person and filed open-records requests to obtain the correspondence of those working at public universities. The researchers who have been targeted study the online spread of disinformation, including falsehoods that have been accelerated by former president and candidate Donald Trump and other Republican politicians. Jordan has argued that content removals urged by some in the government have suppressed legitimate theories on vaccine risks and the covid-19 origins as well as news stories wrongly suspected of being part of foreign disinformation campaigns.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt;Last month, the founder of the conspiracy-theory-prone outlet the Gateway Pundit and others sued Starbird and Stanford academics Alex Stamos and Ren\u00e9e DiResta, alleging that they are part of a \u201cgovernment-private censorship consortium\u201d that tramples on free speech.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yes, a committee of the United States House of Representatives is working in tandem with The Stupidest Man On The Internet (copyright Wonkette). That is where the Republican Party is today. It's not only working the sewers, it's setting up housekeeping there.  \n\\&gt;Starbird\u2019s meeting Tuesday follows a letter from Jordan in March to the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public, which she co-founded to focus on online disinformation. The letter demanded years of her communications, saying the center may have supported a \u201ccensorship regime\u201d backed by the federal government.  \n\\&gt;\u201cWhether directly or indirectly, a government-approved or-facilitated censorship regime is a grave threat to the First Amendment and American civil liberties,\u201d Jordan wrote.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Indirectly,\" of course, is breaking a lot of rock in that sentence, and doing so loudly enough to drown out anyone who points out that there's are actual government-approved censorship regimes in operation in middle-school libraries all over the country. But even that isn't the real point. Long ago, the GOP gave up on convincing the general public that it had any real ideas worth real consideration. You know, like real political parties are supposed to do.  \n\\&gt;In one letter obtained by The Post, Jordan alleges strong ties between the Virality Project and federal government agencies, most notable being the Office of the Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The letter seeks years worth of communications between employees at those organizations and representatives of the executive branch and social media companies. \u201cThe entanglement of Executive Branch agencies, third-party organizations, and technology companies to moderate speech-related content online raises questions about the extent to which these actions affected the civil liberties of American citizens,\u201d Jordan wrote.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wait, the people studying the spread of medical disinformation consulted the people who knew the most about how pandemics work? The horror. I anxiously await Jordan's committee meeting examining the government's plot to bury the miraculous properties of horse paste.",

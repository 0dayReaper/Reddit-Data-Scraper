Like, beyond their voting patterns, there are so many reports about criminal gangs operating out of sheriff offices, or local cops stealing cash from innocent civilians, not to mention the many cases of brutality and misconduct. Couple that with their wagon-circling, brotherhood bullshit and it's quite obvious the whole system has been corrupted.\n\nI dislike cops for being the frontline force of white supremacy, but they give us plenty of other reasons to dislike them as well.",

The police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to specific citizens.\n\nThis'll get ya started: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia\n\nPolice officers are employed by the government to enforce the governments own laws. That is all.\n\n\"To protect and serve\" is a phrase synonymous with police. It's gained such wide recognition, in part, because that is how the greater population views the police and what their duties *ought to be*, but it's really just a motto that started with the LAPD. It's been used, with slight alterations in some cases, by many police departments across the country further solidifying the idea that the duties of a police officer revolve around protecting and serving.\n\nIf you were to tack a noun to the end of that phrase what would it be? \"To protect and serve...\" Our Community? The Citizens? The unsaid part, and completion of the phrase, is: government interest.",

They are \"uncomfortable\".  To teach kids about Stonewall means connecting it to Pride and explaining why it happened.  Then they have to say whether it was necessary or not, and thereby take a stance.  \n\nCan't do that, now can we?  \n\nAnd with so much US history, we can't tell kids everything, so some things get skipped.  \n\nI know I first learned about the Tulsa massacre from a fictional TV show.  I had no idea it really happened.  That is downright *embarrassing* to not know that the US bombed one of its own cities simply because the black people in it were too successful.  \n\nBut that's the point.  That's how our classes were sculpted.  \n\nDon't feel guilty for not knowing, feel angry for not being told.",

It also always seems to be people who will watch the NBA but don't give 2 shits for the WNBA. They almost always have no idea how few trans athletes there are and they don't have any clue what it takes to be a trans athlete.",

Let's say that the right is successful with their anti-trans movement and being trans is outlawed across the country. They won't declare \"mission accomplished\" and retire their slogans. Instead, they'll push to expand by pointing out that trans people are just part of LGBTQ. Therefore, clearly, the \"LGBQ\" people need to be \"taken care of\" next.\n\nAnd once they deal with all LGBTQ people? They'll target immigrants, black people, Muslims, Jews, and whomever else they can attack. \n\nEven if they reduced this country to just straight, cisgender, white, Christian men (with women present but silenced and submissive to the men in their lives), they'd start arguing about who is following the \"correct\" Christianity and who is a RINO following the wrong version of Christianity.\n\nThis movement needs an enemy for them to be working against. It's trans people at the moment, but given the chance they'd come for all of us.",

            "comment": "Violence is becoming the right's default method of imposing their will.  Why?  Because it works.  \n\nThe right has figured out how to use violence to effectively impose their will -- by attacking and intimidating those at the bottom of the food chain who do not have the resources to fight back even if they wanted to.  If they can't get their way through the legal system, they'll get their way by attacking and threatening the individual people responsible for enforcing it.  \n\nThey couldn't get Target to back down on selling pride merchandise.  So instead, they went into stores, caused a bunch of problems, and threatened the 17 year old cashiers and stock clerks who have absolutely no say in what does and doesn't get displayed.  They put Target into a no-win position of either backing down or their local customers and employees would be the ones to suffer the consequences.  \n\nThey can't attack politicians at the top of the food chain.  Most of them either have security detail or their own private security to protect them.  So they intimidate those at the bottom of the political ladder.  The ones who are probably volunteering their time and have absolutely no way to protect themselves from violence, forcing them to either resign and allow a GOP crazy to take over their position or suffer physical retribution.\n\nThis is the dilema we are in.  We, as a society, need to and have the resources to at least fight back against bigotry, racism, and violence.  We, as individual people, often do not.  We cannot expect individual people to put their own health and safety at risk to fight a society-level battle they, individually, cannot win.  The GOP realizes this and are now focusing their efforts on attacking individual people and companies and forcing them out, because individual people do not have the resources necessary to fight back.  \n\nPeople blame companies like Target for backing down in the face of violence.  But those people don't acknowledge the fact that the people who will suffer aren't the CEOs that make the decisions.  It's Harry the stock clerk that works in the target of Bumfuck, Idaho that just happened to be the guy the violent mob got a hold of first.  It's not the Department of Education that gets attacked by the right-wing mob.  It's Ms. Goldstein, the first grade teacher that showed a movie that was written by a gay person, or Jack the local retired dude who volunteers his time sitting on the school board.\n\nIndividual people cannot be expected to hold the line in a battle that society at large needs to fight.  The extremists know this and are acting accordingly.",

However, I feel like the majority of kids who are otherwise spending 6+ hours a day in a diverse community that promotes respect for all different types of people, probably are not bigoted like their parents and have friends in the LGBTQ+ community. I know I would've been ashamed of my parents if they ever pulled crap like this. \n\nAlso it bugs me that protestors like this always try to reduce Pride into sexual orientation. Obviously that's part of it, but a lot of it is just personal identity and being accepted completely as you are. It's about showing our friends and family that they should not feel afraid to walk around without shame, existing in their own skin, which they were given zero choice about.\n\nWhen I see stuff like this, I try to imagine what life would be like waking up in a world where being a straight, white male was the fringe identity under constant attack. I would be afraid all the time, and I'd wish for all the people in my life to support me, recognizing that it's just who I am. No one should feel that way, and holy shit what a waste it is for society to get stuck on this when we could be solving actual problems with the world.",

There's footage of Proud Boys punching middle aged parents and the police arresting the assault victim in his timeline if anyone is still confused about how all this is going down these days. There were more fascist protesters than parents. The only thing that kept the violence halfway in check is because these guys are huge pussies who were afraid of a small group of Antifa in attendance, even with the police in their corner.\n\nSo that we're aware of the state of our country: the LA Times didn't mention the Proud Boys in their preliminary coverage of this in spite of the fact that they were openly organizing in plain sight on Twitter to disrupt this event. The police, as always, appear to be aiding the Proud Boys. And I'm observing all of this from a state that got no air quality warning despite the fact that the Canadian wildfires have fucked up the air here so bad the sun has had a dust halo for 2 days.

            "comment": "One of the biggest tools used by the American right wing media to manipulate parents into hating LGBT identities is the trick of assuming - not even carefully stating, lest they make it too obvious, but assuming - that since those involve gender and sexuality, they must be \u2018sexualised\u2019. I see commentators rant without for a moment pausing to think why the same logic doesn\u2019t apply to straight romances in fairy tales, kids talking about \u2018mommy and daddy\u2019, etc. The attitude that a straight kiss is \u2018romantic\u2019, while a gay or lesbian kiss is \u2018sexual\u2019. \n\nI\u2019ve literally come across right wing commentators saying things like \u2018Why do the kids have to know about gay relationships or know the teacher is gay? Why do they have to hear about their teacher\u2019s fisting exploits that weekend?\u2019 What a jump\u2026 Only a few years ago if a teacher was called \u2018Mrs\u2019 then that told the kids she was married to a man, but \u2018The horror, why do the kids have to know she\u2019s married and straight? It\u2019s just like she showed them a video of her pegging her husband!\u2019 said no-one. \n\nBy never addressing the massively obvious double standard assumption they\u2019re making, that anything LGBT is overtly sexual in a way straight things aren\u2019t, they hop over it straight to preying on (not very smart) parents\u2019 terror of paedophilia.\n\nThe bigots on the right need to snap out of it, but they\u2019re not automatically going to. \n\n\nNow there is nuance here, which the homophobic and transphobic right exploits\u2026 definitely *some* of the most visible queer subcultures - especially gay ones - are very overt and explicit beyond most non-queer equivalents, if any, something a *lot* of ordinary LGBT people find tiresome and misrepresentative. See numerous examples from people having threesomes on Folsom Street, to the disproportionately many more explicit drag acts, to giant penis balloons and gimp suits at some pride parades, if this is contentious. A few months ago I passed a drag act at a Sunday brunch spot in Hell\u2019s Kitchen blaring out masturbation advice so loud it could be heard half a block away. Oppression of gay people means that a lot of people are rebelling and embracing new freedoms, and an all male space has fewer sexual constraints in a certain sense, but this also gets used as a self-righteous excuse to go overboard and even very gross and inappropriate by certain narcissistic and attention-seeking members of the community (let\u2019s not pretend they\u2019re not a thing), with their own garish sub-subcultures, even if most in the gay community find them off-putting and even resent for the image it casts. Some responsible, *actually* \u2018adult\u2019 restraint from casting the grossest public image at Pride and such would help fight that image (and not just be giving in, but be basic decency). Loud minorities can be used to tar everyone with the same brush. And this is the body of material the right wing pundits point to to go straight to the introducing kids to LGBT people -&gt; overtly sexual -&gt; paedo \u2018argument\u2019. \n\nBut someone needs to get through to these parents and emphasise the non-sexualised side of LGBT relations. The majority of LGBT life. Romance, love, queer families, other aspects that have developed around gay culture (singers, artists, aesthetics that have become \u2018traditionally\u2019 gay\u2026 ironically there\u2019s also a stereotype about gay men being more tasteful to draw from, ffs), what have you. This will fight the message, because a lot of the right wing, and scared parents from a different era, are not hearing anything else. Something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e3h6es6zh1c) - a skit showing someone not hiding one\u2019s identity - publicly and unabashedly kissing his boyfriend - but emphasising that not everyone is like Key\u2019s character, even while acknowledging that Key\u2019s sort of person exists. \n\nJust my two cents.",

They weren't making problems, and they were good tenants for landlords struggling to fill units as we were recovering from the recession. Eventually, the city weighed shutting them all down and invited the public to comment at the next city council meeting. Hundreds of people showed up. Dozens spoke and of them exactly two were in favor of closing down the dispensaries. \n\nOf those two, *both stated they didn't even know we had dispensaries until reading it in the newspaper the day before the meeting*. One even talked about regularly going to a shopping center with multiple dispensaries in it and never knowing they were there.\n\nIn spite of the fact that they themselves were living proof that the dispensaries were not negatively impacting the lives of residents, they showed up to tell us how \"wrong\" it was and how \"disturbing\" it was to find out such a thing existed in town because reality and their own experiences were prioritized below what they had been told to think about marijuana.\n\nThe city shut down the dispensaries (as expected) due to it being the path of least resistance (the Obama administration was cracking down at the time), but I'll never forget how disgusted I was with those two mindless pawns of right-wing talking points.",

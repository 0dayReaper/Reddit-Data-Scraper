There are these few votes where he has crossed the line, but never mistake him for a moderate. That would be a huge whitewashing. \n\nNC is near 50/50 red/blue with a significant group of independents.  They are so Gerrymandered though that the state legislature has a super majority of Republicans. These come from underpopulated red religious areas. You step outside the cities, you are in trump land flying confederate flags. They are the people in control. \n\nWhen the city of Charlotte voted to protect LGBTQ+ workers, the state of NC punished the city by creating the draconian bathroom bill. ( Whatever happened to the GOP insistence on \"local rule\" ?) \n\nThank the Democratic governor for keeping things sane.  Now the GOP has enough votes to override his veto and are ready to out-Texas Texas. A democratic representative from a true blue district which voted her in because of her progressive stances woke up one day to discover she'd changed her mind and became a Republican. It was a WTF. \n\nThere is such a huge chasm in NC between the Democrats and Republicans, that it is inconceivable one could overnight decide they had a change of heart. She probably fears they are going to split the district and she wants to keep her job. Despicable.  \n\nWe have local heroes who have been fighting the good fight, if you can afford to give. \n\nhttps://natashamarcus.com/\n\nhttps://www.graigmeyer.com/\n\nThings are about to get very rough here.\n\n( Repeat of my comment on same subject, different post)",

Of course she would be the recipient of email from Hillary. They could have asked for them ANY TIME during the investigation BEFORE closing the case. But it was never deemed important enough. \n\nIt's like asking someone multiple times if they want you to pick something up for them before and during a visit to a store, them refusing and then getting butthurt because they decided they wanted something after you got home. Would that be valid? Fuck no.",

That's why we have the silly guessing game of taxes where you tell them what you make from which employer and the onus is on them to catch you in a lie.\n\nIn a lot of European countries, when you get hired, all that information about your hiring and how much you make goes to the government. So when covid hit, with very minimal overhead the government was able to simply tell everyone to stay home and replace the exact paychecks that they knew people were getting.\n\nIn the US we had to again play this silly game of doing it indirectly through unemployment and PPP which can obviously be gamed, and thus continues people's skepticism of government.",

Essentially they swiped your debit card while you were sleeping, your statement remained the same, but everything around you got 10-20X more expensive. The ones who got the funds are having the time of their lives. Same with 2008 bank failures. Did no one learn anything from Ted kaczynski? Not a great guy morally, but right about most things government.",

The corporate tax rate is low by historic standards too.\n\n&gt; Through the &amp;#039;50s and &amp;#039;60s, corporate taxes never fell below 3 percent of GDP. Before Trump, politicians in both parties had talked for years about cutting corporate tax rates in exchange for eliminating corporate tax loopholes-tax simplification rather than tax reduction.\n\n&gt; Pairing some of the House GOP&amp;#039;s proposed narrow tax cuts with expansion of the child tax credit is an acceptable idea only if it&amp;#039;s attached to other reversals of the 2017 tax law, starting with a restoration of a 35 percent top corporate tax rate.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/144bgig/the_house_republican_twostep_program_cuts_for_the/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688152 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **tax**^#1 **percent**^#2 **rate**^#3 **cut**^#4 **corporate**^#5",

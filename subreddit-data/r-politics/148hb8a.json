            "comment": "The GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee is marking up a slate of tax bills today, giving the first glimpse of lawmakers\u2019 tax priorities in this Congress. \r  \n\r  \nRepublicans laid out their agenda with the release of a package last week, and the markup gives Democrats a chance to attack the business breaks and push their own priorities via amendments. GOP lawmakers with gripes about provisions left out will also weigh in. Lawmakers and staff said they expect the proceeding to be a long one as the committee takes up the package made up of three bills. \r  \n\r  \nThe tax plan would dish out hundreds of billions in tax cuts to both businesses and individuals, offset partially by the repeal of some of the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act energy credits. \r  \n\r  \nThe package serves as a starting point for debate with Democrats in control of the White House and Senate. \n\n[Here are several key issues to watch as the meeting proceeds.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-tax-report/gops-new-tax-package-proposal-markups-key-themes-explained?context=search&amp;index=6)",

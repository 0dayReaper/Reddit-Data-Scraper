The NSW Gov't had just announced they were going to open a casino in Sydney and were taking applications for casino licences. Trump applied, but he was turned down due to his close ties with organised crime - notably the Russians. That was over 30 years ago now.\n\nI was downvoted into oblivion by Trump supporters and I could never understand how this was never mentioned in the American press at the time. I thought it was pretty relevant but never got a mention let alone any traction at all.\n\nHe's been corrupt his whole life. Someone years ago described Trump in a way that I've never forgotten. And that's that he is essentially all the wrongs and ills of modern America wrapped up in an old hotdog skin. The quote was more poetic than that, but that was the jist of it.\n\nIt's pretty wild when you think about it. Casino operators are hardly known for their high standards of ethics but even his history, 30 years ago, was too much for the Gambling Board in NSW. And somehow... somehow... 30 years later he's elected POTUS!",

Trump has claimed that he is the only person who can prevent WWIII.\n\nThe first time he said it, it seemed like especially ridiculous hyperbole \u2014 one-upmanship over his previous fear-based claims. What\u2019s bigger than \u201ccriminal\u201d immigrants flooding across our borders, and left-wing \u201ccommunists\u201d coming for your wealth and freedoms?

The problem is, its way to late for that. The supporters have been trained for so long, they cannot let him go, and anyone that publicly thats tries it will find their future election at risk.\n\nSo they need former people to come forward to push the new plan. Unfortunately, the really do not understand how deep cults work, and the only thing that will stop them worshipping Trump is him bowing out or his death.\n\nHell, I would not put it past the GOP to have him killed and try to blame a left wing trans person for it.",

You\u2019re looking at this from a legal career perspective instead of political. I think you underestimate the corruption of Republican politicians who won\u2019t hesitate to approve her if they get the chance. Remember, these are the same assholes who stole a Supreme Court pick from Obama in an unprecedented maneuver. That was before this MAGA crap. They\u2019re even worse now. They wouldn\u2019t lose any sleep appointing a lower tier judge if they knew she was a reliable MAGA sycophant.",

Likewise they need the loyalty of the big donors (who have all but abandoned Trump).  Pols might have the power to put a lackey on the Supreme Court, but they'd be fools to do it.  And pragmatically, the Pols still need the votes of people like Romney for a Supreme Court slot.  Amy Coney Barrett for example is an arch conservative, but she was from the top echelon of judges.  No way this dope from South FL would get a Scotus slot.  Aside from the bottom tier, the judiciary is still a meritocracy.  Cannon's antics hurt the Republicans and her incompetency would hurt them even more if she were higher than the bottom tier.  She needs to restore her reputation as a competent judge.\n\n(The Freedom Caucus only has the power to disrupt, they don't run things. It's cynical and naive to think that they do. See recent debt limit deal.)",

We did it in 2018 with the senate, then we did it again in 2020 with not just the presidency but **also** the senate and house and ***again*** in 2022 with the Senate as well as *seriously crippling* their measured-gains from the house.\n\nNo one here can tell me that we can't do it again.

And we still won. Don't give a fuck about what his supporters think, you already know a large amount of them are just nutbags who \"found a voice\" in Trump. Shut it out of your mind and just vote for good shit. Don't get lazy.\n\nWhen Trump loses this next round, there is absolutely NOT going to be a round 4 for him. He'll have so consistently created such losses in the GOP that the GOP will have no choice but to abandon him 100%. yeah they aren't going to shit-talk him, but a loss in 2024 is going to hit them **HARD**.

But what if most voters don't think he's guilty?\n\nThe voters think the charges are [politically motivated](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/06/11/ea8233ea-4019-4ebe-bc80-cd0f9bde2300/thumbnail/620x349/000cf09aeb23f371979c17b231012264/trump-indictment-concerns-gop-voters.png) and it shouldn't affect Trump's [ability to do the job](https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/06/11/0941b10b-ed85-494c-b46f-dccc385ef6d5/thumbnail/620x349/7f1b8cd4b06b32dff7661c225f28e7ab/trump-serve-if-convicted-gop-voters.png).\n\n\nApart from DeSantis most likely GOP voters aren't even [considering](https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/06/11/3fad7616-af65-4bd3-a385-04abdc05c4f1/thumbnail/620x349/d87e71d61604377d39f697eeb9bf7186/2024-gop-nom-considering.png) voting for most of the candidates.

He was a true responsible leader during Covid. \n\nIm getting an R ticket at the Primary and voting for him.  \n\nI suggest all of you do the same. Or the 3rd (or 4th) least evil of the R candidates.  And then vote Dem at presidential election.   If an R gets president we need a sane guy like him.",

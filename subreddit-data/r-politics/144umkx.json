I don't think either needs to be criminally prosecuted for what happened. Compare to Trump who knowingly took classified materials, bragged about what he took (at least once on tape), and continuously interfered with the agencies trying to recover them. He absolutely needs to be prosecuted for it.\n\nI live in NY State, and look how quickly the Democrats turned against Cuomo once credible allegations were made of sexual harassment. \n\nOne side and only one side excuses multitudes of crimes as long as they think they are on the same side while continuously making up crimes to accuse their opponents of.",

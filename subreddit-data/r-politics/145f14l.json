He\u2019s a former drug dealer from Staten Island who, while he worked for Steve Bannon, was the guy you went through if you wanted to check out the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. (He once hosted a viewing party of the laptop\u2019s contents.) He also did crisis comms for Matt Gaetz, and, along with Santos, was part of a mini-MAGA cabal that took over the New York Young Republican Club. The club is run by Burra and Santos\u2019s buddy, Gavin Wax. He couldn\u2019t make it to the Beach Cafe for the party Friday because he was off in Hungary, meeting with members of the country\u2019s semi-fascist government.\n\n&gt;Burra and Wax were the ones who put on the Young Republicans\u2019 most recent holiday gala; that was the one at which Marjorie Taylor Greene said that, had she and Bannon planned January 6, \u201cWe would have won. Not to mention, it would\u2019ve been armed.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI couldn\u2019t have staged that any better,\u201d gushes Burra. His own rantings at that gala ripped off chunks of Mussolini\u2019s 1935 \u201cwheel of destiny\u201d speech justifying the invasion of Ethiopia. (\u201cTo acts of war, we shall answer with acts of war \u2026\u201d)\n\n&gt;Santos won\u2019t talk to me, but Burra, a self-described \u201cclout diablo,\u201d says he will. He\u2019s got a plan to turn Santos into the future of the MAGA wing of the party, and he\u2019ll tell me all about it \u2014 so long as I meet him on his home turf.\n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/the-plan-for-george-santos-magas-newest-it-girl.html",

Given Santos' truth-challenged history, the judge personally should absolutely require the guarantors' full names, their exact relationship to the weasel, and verifiable documentary evidence of each relationship - once that information is verified by the judge, the basic acknowledgement that only family are involved should suffice as public assurance.\n\nHis family can legitimately support him (according to ethics rules), even if he is a slimeball.",

By ensuring that AI systems are held accountable and subject to rigorous oversight, the potential for undue influence can be minimized. AI systems can be leveraged to detect and expose disinformation campaigns, identify the sources of misleading information, and provide policymakers with reliable and accurate data. By utilizing AI-powered tools for fact-checking and analyzing large volumes of information, lawmakers can make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of being \"misled\" by virtual lobbyists or any other sources of misinformation. with the right regulatory measures in place, such as robust disclosure requirements and strict adherence to ethical guidelines, the potential for AI-powered lobbying to undermine the democratic process can be diminished. Do you really think we should overlook the fact that technology itself is neutral and its impact is determined by its development, deployment, and regulation? Technology itself is not inherently good or bad. Instead of solely fixating on the risks associated with AI. we should embrace responsible AI development and advocate for regulations that BALANCE innovation with the protection of democratic principles.",

While companies can make mistakes and exhibit knowledge gaps, consider these instances within the BROADER context of technological advancements. Comprehensive policies should be based on a holistic understanding of the field, taking into account the vast array of developments and aiming to address systemic issues rather than singling out specific incidents, especially from \"TikTok\". How come you believe that a single case represents the entirety of technological understanding?",

Because everything by itself isn\u2019t harmful right, it\u2019s only in the hands of people that it is beneficial or harmful and to reduce harm in all other circumstances we have policy and research along with public input that considers social good and converts it into bills that are made into laws. I\u2019m sure you know all this but the point is - [because our corporate structure in which c-level  (where c stands for chief) executives are controlled by a board that only considers share price maximization and nothing else and those execs can hire, fire and set mandates for employees with zero feedback from the employees even if they worked for 20+ years, whereas a chieftain can and should be elected by the employees which we as a society haven\u2019t done yet] our policy and laws are reactionary and only try to prevent more harm or reduce harm after it has already been done. My concern is that with AI - [the changes to society without people\u2019s consent or input from society at large will be so dramatic and irreversible, as you pointed out, that we will end up losing our sense of self and place in the universe and the future generations will end up regressing backwards that is having smaller brains.] the morality of things to come will be impossible to judge.",

If you\u2019re implying you have to roll with the hype train and do mass public harm to get money to do good then i disagree. If you actually have an idea for technology and how you want it to be used to benefit everyone, then find like minded ppl to develop it with you, and then find a bank or credit union to bankroll you like everyone else. Then, take it to market when it\u2019s finished. And if you can\u2019t find a banker that understands then bend the truth. You don\u2019t think business people stretch the truth to get credit every day?  We\u2019re also lied to by most tech companies about the true capabilities of their products and services every day. If you actually have an idea that will benefit everyone and you have the balls not to sell out when a company tries to buy you out to stifle you, then play their little game and use the capital you get to change things.",

It allows people to claim ownership of content which isn't theirs and requires content hosts to immediately pull the content without a shred of proof. It's an effective way to troll small operations without repercussion.\n\nIn all of these instances lawmakers have no actual idea of what all their legislation does or how it functions in the real world.",

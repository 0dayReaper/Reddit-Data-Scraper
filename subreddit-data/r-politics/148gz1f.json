You don't mind identifying as part of a group that continues to lie about the election being stolen?  You don't mind identifying as part of a group that is stoking the flames of violence against the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nI can go on and on about how horrible these people are.\n\nJust remember the saying- \"When a Nazi and 11 of his friends go out to dinner there are 12 Nazis at the table.\"\n\nDon't try to convince me (or anyone) that you are a good person if you still support the Republican party- even if you've never engaged in any of those actions yourself, the fact that you would associate with people who do automatically nullifies any attempts you might make to claim some kind of moral compass.",

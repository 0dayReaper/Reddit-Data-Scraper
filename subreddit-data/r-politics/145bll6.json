When that first indictment came through, media reporting on both sides argued that on the surface that charge appears to be the weakest of the ones we know that he's facing, and that the justification for making it a felony charge was a bit of a stretch. We'll see how it goes, but Trump may be able to more easily argue that, that charge is political in nature, and that the same charge would not have been used against another person committing the same crimes.\n\nThe strength of a NY state conviction though, is that it's the charge that may be least likely pardoned. Any GOP candidate for President may likely promise Trump a pardon of any federal conviction, any future GOP GA governor could pardon Trump if indicted and convicted there, but I think it's a bit of a stretch in today's political climate that a Republican get elected governor in NY.",

It wasn't just not defending the capitol from violent attacks and insurrection. you dont defend something you planned on attacking in the first place.\n\nWhy would trump do anything? The whole GOP (Romney included) all but endorsed his actions the whole time. Why would he do anything different when he doesn't ever have to face consequences...I will give it to Romney though, at least he voted to impeach. Still doesn't cover up his complicity in turning a blind eye to every other corrupt thing trump did.",

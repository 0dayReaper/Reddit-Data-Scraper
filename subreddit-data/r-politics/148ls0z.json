Not a good look when the Washington Post is saying they want to expose kids to kinky shit at a pride event.\n\nIs pride about gender identity or is it about sexuality?  Because the 2 are most definitely not intrinsically interlinked.  Trans people, and cis people, can have any number of sexualities regardless of how they identify, vanilla or not.  Gender identity in itself is as independent from sexuality as anything but if a sizable portion of stamp collector events included dudes in assless chaps and women flashing their tits while encouraging people to bring their kids, people are going to notice and ask questions.\n\nYou can have a pride event without the bdsm and burlesque, yet the 2 seem to go hand in hand at these events.  Why?",

I think in this context, anyone taking their shirt off shows a certain lack of respect, which if we're being honest, is mostly what wearing \"polite attire\" is all about. As others have pointed out, it's not really about the legality of exposing yourself in that situation, and I haven't read about this individual being charged with anything. Believe it or not, not everything comes down to whether it's legal. In fact, there are a lot of things in life that are perfectly legal but incredibly rude.\n\nAlso, unfortunately the anti-trans movement is doing everything it can to mislabel the trans community as being groomers and sexual deviants. Actions like this, while I would not say actually affirm those accusations, certainly don't help. We all want progress to move at a lightning pace, but in reality it's closer to a turtle. It's a pretty big achievement for the White House to embrace pride so openly and this is a huge step forward if we can keep the momentum, but that momentum is hindered when you lose the support of more moderate individuals who don't take issue with the LGBTQ+ community, but expect the same level of decorum as they do from people outside the community.",

It was fun an exuberant, but it came after a somber weekend at a cousins celebration of life nearby. People were *wild* like I haven\u2019t seen in a while. Not even the skinny dipping or drugs or crowds, but the women coming up to me asking me to put slinky\u2019s on their bare breasts and being overly affectionate and \u201copen\u201d while I\u2019m with my family and friends. If it had been reversed I was doing that to a woman (even just my chest not my dong or anything) I would\u2019ve been arrested. I\u2019m down for a fun time and I was having one, and no hard feelings against those enjoying themselves too but some boundaries got crossed I wasn\u2019t really up for. I\u2019ve been to some nude gatherings and more consensually \u201copen\u201d events but there are times for those. An event touted as family friendly though\u2026. I\u2019m not saying breasts are nudity or gross or necessarily inappropriate but you gotta know your audience. And keep your hands to yourself.",

I think in this context, anyone taking their shirt off shows a certain lack of respect, which if we're being honest, is mostly what wearing \"polite attire\" is all about. As others have pointed out, it's not really about the legality of exposing yourself in that situation, and I haven't read about this individual being charged with anything. Believe it or not, not everything comes down to whether it's legal. In fact, there are a lot of things in life that are perfectly legal but incredibly rude.\n\nAlso, unfortunately the anti-trans movement is doing everything it can to mislabel the trans community as being groomers and sexual deviants. Actions like this, while I would not say actually affirm those accusations, certainly don't help. We all want progress to move at a lightning pace, but in reality it's closer to a turtle. It's a pretty big achievement for the White House to embrace pride so openly and this is a huge step forward if we can keep the momentum, but that momentum is hindered when you lose the support of more moderate individuals who don't take issue with the LGBTQ+ community, but expect the same level of decorum as they do from people outside the community.",

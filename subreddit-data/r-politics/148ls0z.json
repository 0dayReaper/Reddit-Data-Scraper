Our protests shouldn't offend those with the power to stop our oppression.  That makes sense.  \n\n&gt; standard decency.\n\nThis has always been a tool against underprivileged people.  \"If they would just be decent and respectable, the cops wouldn't have to shoot them.\"  \"Their lives are actually better as slaves because they've learned civility.\"  \"I don't mind them being gay, but why do they have to flaunt it?\"",

Other people didn't ask to see her body. If a guy did this, cis or trans, there'd be discussions about if helicoptering your dick on the White House lawn counts as a sex crime.\n\nBut because it's tits reddit throws all context out the window and talks down to you for saying \"maybe you keep your clothes on at the black tie function.\"",

The Church has a stance against birth control but if you dig into what practices the congregation actually follows you find that a good majority have had sex before marriage and both approve of and use birth control.

That's sort of the underlying problem we have in the US is all these opinions about abortion and contraception are essentially fringe opinions but they end up as side-cars on other issues that have broader appeal. So when you vote for a party thinking \"this party will move the economy forward\" you also have to take this minority stance on abortion and contraception along with the economic policies.",

Bill Cosby used it to criticize black people.  Plenty of people used it to criticize feminism.  It's weird how conservatives always say everything would just be fine if oppressed people would simply behave with some decorum.  I forgot about how the Civil War was won because slaves learned manners.",

Would they ever call them that on a cis woman?\n\n&gt;A transgender-identifying male and Idaho-based model who became famous for TikTok content, Montoya was captured on video on Saturday flashing attendees in front of the White House, off the balcony of which the Pride flag and the American flag were draped. A transgender-identifying female, also topless, but whose breasts were surgically removed, stood next to Montoya in the frame.\n\nThe writing in this article is a complicated nightmare, just to own the libs I guess. So \"transgender-identifying male\" and \"transgender-identifying female\" are how conservatives want to refer to them now?",

It's the modern equivalent of \"admitted/self-proclaimed homosexual John Doe\".",

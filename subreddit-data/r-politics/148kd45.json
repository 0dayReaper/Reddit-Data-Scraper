When pressed about the things they say, I get the feeling that they are just being edgy and want to shock people. However, some students really do not agree with all the pro-LGBT and pride month stuff and are pretty vocal about why they don't like it (mostly religious reasons).\n\nI also find a lot of students have way more respect for Trump than for Biden. I've had both presidents on my projector speaking. Trump gets laughs, Biden gets Boo's. Nearly all of my students are not white.\n\nIt just kind of goes against what you'd expect to see.",

And the only thing I can figure is that because they only see things in black/white, they view things through a lens of normal/traditional, whereas liberals/Democrats see things in shades of gray and like to think about big picture broad swath types of stuff. So while Democrats see trans/gay pride stuff as celebrating the diversity of the human experience, Republicans see it as normal/traditional values being ditched or replaced by these things. It's why people like Matt Walsh harp on shit like male breastfeeding or grooming, because just seeing things like a transman lactating or drag queens leads them to believe that instead of representing the diversity of human experience through its outliers, they're coming to replace normal and traditions with these stories. And so on with Trump, he represents to them in some way an outsider with business acumen who is going to hold the system accountable, so they don't think the system will hold politicians accountable, except as in their own fantasies about locking up Hillary and Biden's Son. Any justice department action against a politician becomes political in their eyes, just by the association and they think Hillary and Biden are only being excused because of political reasons.

If you don't, by now, see Trump's supporters and Trump himself as an actual for real cult then you haven't paid any attention. \n\nIt's a cult. They will not change even when/if he's incarcerated. \n\nWhich means: they're going to go wacko, kill people, shoot people, be idiots, etc. *no matter what happens*. Trump not getting indicted would still result in his fans being just as rabid as they are now, every bit as devoted to him and every bit as willing to just go shoot people if it were to simply please him for 5 minutes. \n\nSo either way he has to be given his trial and if convicted, then he for **sure** has to be imprisoned. Can you imagine for just 1 moment that you are in the DoJ, you just charged Donald Trump for the crimes of obstruction of justice and **espionage** yet you decide to not pursue imprisonment and instead impose a gigantic fine or something equally as stupid....\n\nThat would literally lead straight to Trump normalizing his criminal behavior *even more*, doing *even worse things,* hyping up his supporters to do the same thing (crime like mad) and most disastrously, it would lead to Trump basically having only had to pay out (which he wouldn't) to get past the punishment phase of being found out to be a criminal. \n\nWhich, as he famously stated about lawsuits: Lawsuits and the like are, to him, just a cost of doing business. It's extremely easy to envision a future where he says the same thing about his criminal charges (if he's only on the hook for some stupidly massive fine or some dumb shit).\n\nThe DoJ ***has*** to be aware of this and if they have any worth to them at all, they will *pursue punishment according to how the law states they need to* which yes does mean real jail time. I'm sure it'd be some weird workaround since you clearly can't send him + his secret service detail to gen pop, but the point remains that the only way this can finally start getting better 1 slow ass bit at a time, is to actually punish Trump.

I\u2019ll wager Jordan has more crimes under his belt than most know, and that it will come out during the Trump trials. We have a massive Russian infiltration in our political system, far worse that what the Germans did during WWII. \n\nFor those unaware, during WWII the Nazi leadership conspired with U.S. senator Lundeen, other congressmen, and religious leaders to undermine the United States and weaken our resolve to support and defend allies in Europe. It went so far that Nazis wrote the very speeches delivered by said senator. Even worse, Christian nationalists obtained weapons and explosives from the National Guard and succeeded in blowing up four U.S. munitions plants killing hundreds of Americans in an effort to stymie US efforts to defend Europe. \n\nIt would be a grave mistake to not keep that in the forefront of your thoughts as you watch the so called \u201cpatriots\u201c in the Republican Party echo Russian propaganda. Their mouthpieces include Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, MTG, Jordan, Boebert and very likely Trump himself. There are definitely others involved. History repeats itself and many are unaware of how close the U.S. came to falling for this back then because it is intentionally removed from our history education by conservatives meaning to clear their name in yet another failed attempt to overthrow democracy. \n\nThis is not a Democrats vs Republicans fight. This is the literal fight for U.S. Democracy.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Soon after becoming the far-right chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding information about, among other things, the investigation into an ongoing criminal investigation into Donald Trump.\n\n&gt; A couple of months later, Jordan was it again, taking steps to intervene in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg&amp;#039;s investigation into Trump - even before the former president was indicted.\n\n&gt; House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, is calling on the Justice Department to provide lawmakers with internal documents laying out the scope of special counsel Jack Smith&amp;#039;s investigation into the former president&amp;#039;s handling of classified documents found last year at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1448x57/jim_jordan_tries_again_to_intervene_in_dojs_trump/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688113 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Jordan**^#1 **investigation**^#2 **Trump**^#3 **Committee**^#4 **president**^#5",

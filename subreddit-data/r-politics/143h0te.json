If there was a legal way to count the fake electors, or use the fake electors to disqualify the real ones he would have done it in an attempt to throw the election to the House where republicans held a larger number of state delegations (each state would receive 1 \"vote\" and as long as all republicans went with the program it could have resulted in a trump \"win\").",

That was their red line, obviously: willing to do immoral or support all kinds of immoral acts, like voter suppression, kids-in-cages and extortion of the U.S.\u2019s allies, but drew the line at doing something that had at least a reasonable chance of landing them in prison.  \n\nQuite the paragons of bravery, those guys.",

Those left leaning folks have trouble figuring what bathroom to use.

The tip of the spear folks in the military - that do the ass kicking \u2026. They are on the right - nearly all of them.  There are as many left leaning ass kickers in the military as there are climate scientists who disagree with global warming.\n\nIf you think conservative soldiers will shoot their own conservative bretheren over you, then progressiveism will be a footnote in the history of natural selection.  They took an oath.. sure\u2026to the constitution; which they believe is large part is being co-opted by the left.  Do you think their oath is to listen to Dark Brandon, or to the constitution as interpreted by Steve Bannon?)\n\nSo, maybe this, \u201ceveryone on the right sucks and needs to be shouted down and cancelled\u201d may not be a great long term survival strategy.",

He didn't refuse to decertify because he has morals or wanted to \"Do ThE rIgHt ThInG.\" He did it because he's a slimy coward who decided it was more beneficial to try to convince the rubes that he has some kind of honor, because he saw a chance to do what he's doing now.

We have a confederate culture up here from people who have no connection to the south. \n\nUnteaching something that\u2019s been a child\u2019s home life for 15-18 years is almost impossible. \n\nThere\u2019s an odd connection, especially in the north, of people connecting to southern pride as a connection to being the underdog. Look up the book White Trash by Nancy Isenberg. Someone that grows up in a low socio-economic standpoint that also grows up with a core-self-identity as being an underdog, develops deep rooted beliefs. \n\nAt one point, people started connect struggle/class struggle with being poor and with a pride of being \u201ccountry.\u201d A loud/vocal minority of these people identify with the confederacy as their people. \n\nThis is a reality of self-identity that is taught to some children from birth. There is nothing they have seen until they are in the school system. By the time these children are old enough to be taught all of this, the identity is deeply engrained. To teach contrary to what someone has grown up in is not something easily taught. Some change, others dig deeper and double down finding solace in their family and community that also proudly identify with a \u201cwhite trash\u201d and/or confederate culture.  \n\nThose people are usually so proud that they become quite vocal or wear their pride on their personage through flags, shirts, etc. This is a cultural problem rooted at what is learned from infancy and their time in the home. We teach, but teaching against that kind of identity-belief is limited in success.",

To help prevent this from happening again the [Virginia Slave Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Slave_Codes_of_1705) were written into law. These racist caste laws helped keep the the poor separated and divided instead of working together. Racism was invented to \"Divide and Profit\".

Poor whites have been treated horribly through US history, but have always seemed to hold on to the whole \u201cat least I\u2019m better than [insert any racist name here]\u201d thing. \n\n10/10 recommend this book.

Identifying with the \u201ccountry\u201d or \u201credneck\u201d or \u201cwhite trash\u201d ideal is where some of these people develop their peer connections. \n\nWe all have/love trucks, we all love the same music, we all dress similar, we all enjoy similar activities like hunting and fishing. These peer areas need one adamant person (for whatever their reason) to be a vocal dissent to what what is being taught.  One peer in that group to say the teacher is an idiot and stick harder to their guns. One person to google two counter points and spread it to their friends. \n\nThe family culture sets the core belief while the peer group supports it and builds their ideal stronger. There\u2019s a reason it is not a common belief anymore (at least around here). That\u2019s why the majority of people consider these people ignorant as mentioned by someone earlier in this thread. \n\nThat is why we keep teaching it. So the next generation can make their decision. \n\nWe see the majority of them are agreeing the confederacy is racist and antebellum.

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.\"",

This lets people know if they've been removed from the rolls before election day, which lets them re-register on time. People who like to research candidates or issues have plenty of time to do so. No one has to miss work to vote; you can drop your ballot off in one of dozens of drop boxes at any time within a window of a few weeks or drop it in the mail no stamp needed. We had 49.5% participation in the primary... which isn't what it should be but sure is better than a lot of places.",

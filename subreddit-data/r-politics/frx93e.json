So we are back in the labs now :(\n\nI was excited at first because we were all sticking up for one another, and we got some wins on our side too, but after the threat from the company everyone caved even though they couldn\u2019t do shit to us right now.

I can walk in and be told by my manager that he or she is too busy, or if they do hear me out... just be told that they can't do whatever it is you want.  At my work, there is a safety issue that gets brought to the attention of management every so often.  Has been present for 9 years.\n\nYeah, it is great having no negotiating power at all.  I mean at least I get to be told \"no\" directly!",

And uh... well that's about it.  Maybe you get your pay a day early in some cases.  Otherwise, you can use any one of their 17 ATMs across America to avoid the fee!  \n\n\nI know a lot of banks also charge ATM fees, but many do not.  Some charge and reimburse you later.  Either way, it is usually less than these pay card fucks charge.  If you maintain a minimum balance there is more often than not, no maintenance fee either.  Again, not true with most pay cards.  \n\n\nThis alone, the fact that your employer would allow someone to offer you this kind of bum deal which is directly related to your pay... should prove to every employee that you NEED a union to speak for you.  Your voice alone means jack shit and absent any meaningful opposition they will naturally always opt for whatever makes them the most money at a cost to the employee.",

Their mandate is to gut unions and the middle class. \n\nI don't think people realized how much things have changed. I grew up in the 70's, my dad is an immigrant from eastern Europe. He worked as waiter then restaurant manager at a fancy hotel and was union. We had a solid middle class lifestyle (mom did not even work) with healthcare. I know that it can never be like that again and much of the difference is not because of pay but it needs to improve drastically.\n\nA major benefit of unions besides pay is stability. If you have no stability you are constantly afraid of losing what little you have and it's much more difficult to get loans or invest money.",

I worked a meat department union gig in college and I had all sorts of benefits right out of the gate like time and half on Sundays, healthcare, vacation, sick, personal days and compensation payouts in the case of an injury. I've worked proper full on professional jobs that barely offered anything close to a level of security and benefits. Even despite being a higher paying gig, my insurance was fucking outrageous and didn't cover shit, and vacation and personal time was always a battle to kick around.",

The only time I worked for a job with a union, they kept me from being fired for not providing proof of my grandmother\u2019s death and the location of the funeral when taking bereavement. After telling me I wouldn\u2019t need any of that. I could have grabbed a booklet (or whatever they are called) but I didn\u2019t. It was already super sudden and wasn\u2019t my most clear-headed moments, but having a corporation basically tell me to have my grandfather fax a copy of her death certificate days after she died was enough to convince me that these maniacs will do whatever they want to their employees unless legally obligated not to.\n\nFuck union busting pieces of shit. Unions are the way forward in this country, and one of the few things the billionaire elite class is actually scared of. There is a reason people literally went into armed conflict with the government over unions in the past. Maybe it\u2019s getting closer to being time for the past to repeat itself.",

She looks back at those years as her favorite years and refuses to believe that anything has changed since. Or she looks at it as the model for how things should always be, forever. If that were the case, I'd ask her how she felt about being paid $1.60/hr today.",

For bigger companies offering health insurance lowers their tax liability in the amount that they pay for the insurance, same for the employee. If your company operates on small enough profit margins to support the owners and employees only that pre tax benefit isn't enough to counteract the expenses including the overall tax liability. To put it simply; health insurance offered by large companies acts as a tax shelter. A big enough pool of participants could result in the tax liability being dropped to a lower marginal tax rate. Which is part of the reason why but business doesn't lobby to alleviate the burden of having to offer insurance. For small business it still is a burden.",

Only now we\u2019re being forced to acknowledge it.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how fast the \u201cexpendable\u201d workers not deserving of a living wage became \u201cessential\u201d overnight.\n\nSo, which is it? Are these workers not worth anything and therefore not worth being paid a fair, living wage or is the work they do day to day valuable to our society just as any other person showing up to do their job?\n\nPick one, cause it can\u2019t be both.",

Customers will pay any price for gas, will pay $8 for coffee and won\u2019t care about starbucks raising their prices, have no issue with buying plane tickets at inflated rates, but will fight your small business trying to charge more than what they paid for service 20 years ago and will just go over to the next store if you dare to charge more. \n\nMost small businesses with what you think are poor business models are tied to pricing structures they are set within an industry. So unless industries as a whole make a change, businesses can\u2019t change change their business model to adjust pricing that reflects higher living wages for employees because the customer will say \u201cit\u2019s a shame minimum wage is so low\u201d yet that same customer will take the business elsewhere if your prices increase. Rent goes up, utilities go up, tariffs raise costs, employees need higher pay to live, yet somehow prices need stay the same. \n\nConsumers need to reflect on that.",

            "comment": " I  just got this email. Any thoughts?\n\n\"Hello everyone,\n\nThis might get lengthy, but it is important information, and I encourage all of you to please read through it in its entirety.\n\nI want to first start out by saying that I sincerely hope that everyone is well, and taking care of themselves as best as they are able during this challenging time.\u00a0 This is such new and uncharted landscape for all of us and I want to make sure that each of you feel supported and are getting your questions answered.  Many of you have reached out to me, and I appreciate how professional and patient you have been in our communications. I encourage anyone who has questions or concerns to email, text, or call me, any time. If I have somehow missed a response, please remind me- with the recent influx of communication, I want to make sure that no one gets lost in the communication shuffle.\u00a0\n\nA number of people have reached out to me or their leadership team over the past two weeks regarding increased pay, company paid leave, and financial concerns related to reduced hours. Some have referenced \u201chazard pay\u201d, while others have suggested that we shut down all operations and pay all team members until the Shelter in Place order is lifted.\u00a0 Some have requested their vacation and sick time to offset the financial impact of reduced hours. Everyone has been incredibly professional, and their communications well thought out, and welcomed.\n\nIn response to these inquiries, and in total transparency, I want to take some time to let you know how we are doing our best to plan and implement changes in order to weather through this difficult time.\n\nAs many of you are aware, prior to the Shelter in Place order from the state, and San Francisco and Sonoma Counties, there was an incredible increase in sales in the dispensaries for a day or two.\u00a0 Following the Shelter in Place and being designated as an essential business, we moved to a Delivery and Pick-up only model in order to continue to provide safe access to cannabis to our customers, as well as to stay in business and continue to employ all of our team members.\n\nDue to these changes, and the overall implications of COVID-19, we began to track a decrease in sales ranging from 20-40% in our stores.\u00a0 In an effort to prevent layoffs, furloughs, or store closures, we immediately did several things:\n\n1. Our CEO Erich Pearson and COO Sean Kelley made the decision to stop getting paid at all. *Neither of them are receiving a paycheck* at this time.\n2. We reduced Director and VP salaries by 25%.\u00a0\n3. We reduced most manager salaries by 15%\n4. We furloughed (Temporarily laid off) several team members who would not be able to work within their roles due to the Shelter in Place changes.\n5. Identified that there would be a lack of PPE and sanitizer, as well as other necessities, so increased our ordering levels, and began producing our own sanitizer\n6. Increased production of sanitizer to distribute to local hospitals and emergency personnel\n\nAll of these things were necessary for us to continue to maintain the level of operations and staffing we need to be able to keep our doors open, pay our overhead, pay payroll, etc. without impacting our non-leadership team members in retail and operations with layoffs or other reductions.\n\nYou might wonder why things are running so tightly financially that this is necessary, and why we are unable to pay a premium for those working in retail?\n\nAs a company, we run very conservatively. We budget very carefully, and this has allowed us to continue our operations and our organic business growth, employing 130 people, and subsidizing health insurance, paying holidays, PTO, team member discounts, etc., *while we have seen other companies our size and larger, lay-off 25-50% of their staff over the last 6 months.*\n\nFurther considerations:\n\n* Currently, the majority of our sales are coming from Delivery. Delivery has a much, much higher cost per sale due to time, mileage, insurance, and other overhead.\n* Despite many of the grants and benefits that the government has made available to other small businesses, cannabis does not qualify to receive any of these. As we are still federally illegal, we are not eligible for any federal assistance due to COVID-19.\n* Even though the state regulated and legalized cannabis, we still fall under a tax requirement called 280E. This means that we are unable to deduct most business expenses that normal businesses can deduct, meaning we pay almost twice the amount of taxes, including on payroll.\n\nThe information above outlines why it is that we cannot simply close all departments and pay our team members while they are home, and why we are unable to allow for accrued vacation time to be used to supplement changes in hours due to decreased store hours. We are making necessary reductions in all areas in an attempt to come out on the other side with everyone\u2019s jobs intact and all stores and facilities primed to get back to normal.\n\nI realize that this is a lot of information, and I appreciate you having read it through. I want each of you to know that we are doing everything that we possibly can in order to reduce the impact to you, to keep everyone safe and well while continuing to provide safe access to our communities.\u00a0 To say that this time is unprecedented is putting it lightly.  This is an incredible time of change, and change comes with unknowns, stressors, and requires adaptation and understanding. But change can also result in people coming together in ways they had not before, and in refining and improving previous processes for the future.\u00a0 I read all of your feedback; all of your concerns and suggestions, and recognize the weight of it. It is appreciated, and we will continue to listen and to take into account all of the ideas and questions that are communicated as we move forward.\n\nThank you all for being a part of SPARC. Together, we can get through this.\n\nWarmly,\n\nHuman Resources\"",

I can only find two potential frustrations with it.  The first is that it mentions \"other companies\" laying off people, which is vague. If I had friends in a similar company, I would get their opinion on if this is true. The second potential frustration is that while salaries are cut, nothing is said about bonuses. If this company is heavy with performance bonuses, that game could be rigged.\n\nUltimately, if my employer gave me this memo, I would be grateful.

'finders fees', 'application fees' - basically renters need to bribe landlords to have a chance at renting a unit. Or it becomes entirely based on connections, insider information, and influence.    If the rental market isnt determined by money, it will be influenced by power anyways.     \n  \nAnd when there arent nearly enough units for the number of people renting - because there is no profitability to incentivize building new units - people end up jumping through far more hoops and paying tons of money anyways. Which is why every study shows rent controls *reducing* housing supply.  And people without units have no means to get one outside of bribes.     \n  \nOr you make the government build mass housing for everyone, and you end up with [soviet era housing units](https://i.redd.it/mfrkwcq1iwuz.jpg), or  [communal apartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_apartment) where between 2 and 7 families share one tiny apartment.

I would love to see it happen but idk how possible it is. Another, potentially better alternative is making x% of all multifamily housing listed at affordable prices, so you will have a mix of people living in different places and creating a more diverse community",

Just plain tired from the thundering hoards of easily spooked people all making the same lame jokes about stocking up. How nice they have time to use the products I sell- I sure haven\u2019t. And I might actually slap someone if they don\u2019t stop talking about how bored they are with nothing to do. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve done nothing but work and sew lame ass home made masks to hopefully protect my coworkers from customers who won\u2019t stay home and won\u2019t stay 6 ft away and you will think I\u2019m kidding but they cough and sneeze and think it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s not funny. I\u2019m so grateful to still have a job and so grateful to have bosses that have really gone the extra mile to support us but many days I just end up shaking my head and thinking \u201cwe humans really suck and probably deserve all this bullshit we have in our lives\u201d.\nK rant over",

My state has 16,000 cases roughly, and I'm a gambling man, but not with my life. Not for minimum wage",

Pretty much everything in America is overpriced except for maybe gasoline. The prices we pay for food are nonsense. Service people plainly rob you and want you to do half the setup before they even start the job. Every home is overpriced and so is most rent. We really need to rein in the greed that leads to all of this ridiculous pricing if we want to make any sort of progress.",

At least then the appeals chain would be much shorter to the Supreme Kangaroo Court.  \n\n\nThe reality is the actions taken that were the real criminalities were all done in FL, so the case being heard there is logical. The possession of the materials isn't being prosecuted, it's the withholding and coverups that all happened in FL that are the crimes and also what separates it from Biden, Pence, Clinton, and any other voluntary search and surrender of materials.",

By going to FL, the DOJ has cut-off many delay tactics.  Cannon is at best, a mere irritation.

Some legal analysts think that they might wait until she makes another biased decision in favor of Trump to do so.  Since she was reversed and severely reprimanded by the 11th circuit in her first fiasco in this case, there are good grounds for her removal.  If she is not removed, the one comfort is that she will be under intense scrutiny no matter what she does, by the GOP if she doesn't favor Trump, and by the federal courts if she does.  I would think she would be most concerned about her tenure and might want to avoid risking another spanking from her bosses.",

The repercussions on our education systems, transit systems, infrastructure, medicare, and pretty much every other state and local responsibility would have been immensely worse than what they are today. Inflation does suck, a lot, but people are working, the economy is growing healthily (albeit with some bigger challenges in certain markets), and inflation it was generally a lot worse in almost every other country.   \n\n\nStimulus to low income individuals likely didn't cause inflation anyways, what did was locking down and the massive shift to WFH for many white collar workers. Those individuals and upper management are the ones who caused the inflationary pressures because they were inevitably the ones who started spending boatloads of savings after 2 years of spending money on nothing. There's also a case to make that the eviction moratorium also led to rent and housing inflation, but there's also the case that lockdowns were also a huge blame there, since property values in most major cities tanked when the lockdowns were initiated, and price growth was only coming in a matter of time.",

One of them said $2000.00 per month per person. That would have given our family 10k a month. My brain glitched for a minute as I thought about how I was raised to believe that would be bad for everyone, but then I thought about what we as a family would do with that 10k a month and realized it would ALL go back into the economy. Medical care for me(I need about 32k in dental work), camps and art programs for my kids, renovations to our almost 100 year old house, I\u2019d buy more local food and products that tend to be more expensive, but would put money directly into my neighbors pockets, the list goes on and on for how beneficial it would be for my family and in turn our economy!!! I\u2019m grateful for the reps trying to renew the child tax credit, even that money made a difference for our family!!",

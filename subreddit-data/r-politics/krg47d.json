There\u2019s literally no reason for their votes except Fox News said democrats bad and they don\u2019t like the blue team because the red on is better. It should burn you up, it\u2019s dangerous and absurd and awful. I wish I knew how to fix it and make people actually talk about it logically, but no amount of talking about how great the bills are is going to turn a Celtics fan into a Lakers fan so it seems like a fruitless venture",

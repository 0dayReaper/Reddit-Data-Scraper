To feel like winners and to feel superior to the losers \n\nIt's all feelings and fear of a world that is leaving them behind in terms of values. Trump appeals to both of those.\n\nIt doesn't matter trumps rich he says what they wish they could says and got elected potus. It's \"proof\" their ideals aren't dying.",

Now to be clear, I'm not saying that to be cruel or insulting; it's merely an observation of fact. I'm fat and ugly myself, so I'm not faulting them for it. But it's interesting how they're the ones so desperately insecure about it that they project onto \"the libs\" as being weak and unfit.",

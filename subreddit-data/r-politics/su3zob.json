Businesses get the laws passed, not passed, repealed, or circumvented that they need to facilitate their business plans. The main job of elected officials is to make that happen in exchange for money and favors, as well as sell these decisions to their constituents as needed. All the crap about bathrooms or the environment or whatever is just window dressing to galvanize a voter base that has no interest in these business plans, or is often harmed by them.\n\nIt's a generalization, but that is the status quo, and the rare politicians that have principles stick out lie sore thumbs, and get ostracized and neutered of meaningful power.",

I want those bad people caught, fucked up, &amp; if need be, tossed in a prison not to their liking, &amp; forced to regret their actions for the rest of their lives. This, this waiting around until these assholes die off, is grossly inefficient. First, they will recruit young people to take up where they left off. Second, they will put things in place, policies, contracts, etc, to ensure none or little interruptions to their way of life, which is wrong way of life. These are among a few long term tactics that will be deployed, if not already deployed, to which all such clever bullshit MUST be halted.\n\nThe problem is this issue is a deep rooted one within both society, &amp; the individual who resides in that society. It will take consistent &amp; long, long term commitment, in order to get rid of such corruption among human beings.",

The last time Trump was involved with a charity he's was found commissioning artwork of himself and squandering the cash which is why he can no longer organize a charity in New York. \n\nWhile there's a distinction in how the people you cited ask for money, Bernie was right about publicly funded elections and getting money out of politics. Democracy is for the people not for the 1%-0.001% to manipulate with their stolen labor and capital.",

It's *correctly interpreting the Founder's intent* when conservatives do it.\n\nhttps://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/the-anti-majoritarian-mistake\n\n&gt;Think about the nature of the disagreement. Consider the liberal claim implicit in this disagreement. The claim is that the conservative interpretation of the Constitution is incorrect. Now, you can agree or disagree with this, but you can\u2019t make the disagreement go away by simply stipulating that, actually, conservatives are correct about the Constitution. That\u2019s what we call \u201cbegging the question.\u201d However, the problem isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s illogical to assume what needs to be established because this is politics, not logic. Disagreement is the stuff of politics. Propositions such as \u201cConservatives are correct about the Constitution\u201d can\u2019t be established in any politically meaningful sense; the ineradicable nature of this sort of fundamental disagreement is perhaps the foundational political problem. Who\u2019s actually right is much less important than the fact that there\u2019s high-stakes disagreement that will never go away.\n\n&gt;At best, begging the question against political rivals on matters as basic as the meaning of the Constitution and the content of our rights and liberties amounts to a naive failure to grasp the political problem posed by pluralistic disagreement. At worst, it represents an illiberal urge to bulldoze the problem of pluralism by denying that political rivals with incompatible views can have a valid claim to power. \n\nAnd, yeah, that seems pretty self-evident, doesn't it?  It really all boils down to \"conservatives don't believe that liberals have a valid claim to power.\"",

Federal legislators have the power to shift markets, and they have a lot of access to private insider information.\n\nI'm not so sure at the state level. Most corporate stocks are not affected very much by state policy, and I don't think that most state lawmakers have access to a lot of insider corporate information. I could be convinced that a conflict of interest policy could be created, which would prevent the owning of stock of corporations that are headquartered in the state or that have business before the state.\n\nI am opposed to this at the local level. Local elected officials have almost zero influence to shift markets, and almost no access to insider information.\n\nI was once involved at the local level of government - not elected, it was an appointed position. Someone came up with the great idea of creating a conflict of interest policy, and as part of it, I was asked to disclose:\n\n* My salary, paid by a private employer that was outside of the city.\n* All of my stock market investments, along with their value, including 401k balance and mutual funds.\n* The amount of money I had left on my mortgage (sale price and loan amount are public record).\n* Amount owed on credit cards, etc.\n\nI told the city that they could count on me not volunteering for them anymore if that was a requirement, because I had no interest in making my private finances public information so that I could serve for free.",

The company is publicly traded (PLL) and it already secured a Tesla contract. Lawmakers could profit from knowing they will approve that mine ahead of time by buying shares in either corporation.

Make all elections State and Federally funded by giving each person up to $50 credit or so to split amongst the candidates each individual would prefer and donate too. Our tax money used to elect our candidates-instead of back room deals for corporate interest. Make the candidates beholden to their constituencies again. Make the tv/radio/newspaper stations/outlets use x amount of airtime to play commercials to meet their new requirements for their broadcast licenses but sprinkle some airtime money minimums from the government as well. These big media buys by candidates most definitely changed how local tv, radio and newspaper covered them. Along with being a combat veteran, I worked for years in news on a state/national level for a couple local stations then at ABC News, Fox News full time then other \u201calphabets\u201d as a freelancer until I went into the commercial world shooting food, beverage, cosmetics and products in Chicago, NYC and LA. Every tv station/network I worked for had super corporate/right wing agendas\u2014 money = right wing conservatives. Take corporate greed and dangerous foreign dark money out of our political equations.",

All she said was:\n\n&gt;\"Public officials should remove all conflicts of interest \u2014 whether you're at the federal or the state level,\" Warren told Insider.\n\nAnd every story with that headline I can find simply links back to that very mushy quote.

This leaves many investments open to lawmakers but creates a higher barrier to legislating in a way the know will cause financial gains.\n\nI support what Warren is asking for here. Limiting investments to indexes, funds and/or through blind trusts is appropriate to minimize conflict of interest. Those limitations don't preclude a legislator from making money from a healthy stock market either.",

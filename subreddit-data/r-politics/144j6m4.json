[63% of Republican primary voters](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1171660997/poll-republicans-trump-president-convicted-crime) will still vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.    Not an indictment, a *conviction*.   Some polls have this number as low as 45%, but in a crowded primary, this is still a guaranteed win.  Trump _will_ be the nominee, unless the party kicks him out and removes him as a candidate.  \n\n2. 100% of Republican voters will vote for whoever the nominee is, regardless of any other factors.  That is just what happens.  \n\n3. Polls like the one in OP are measuring what would happen if we had a popular vote.  We don't?  We this whole electoral college thing going, instead.     \n\n\nSo, Trumps odds of winning the presidency in 2024 are exactly the same whether he is convicted or not.  \n\nThe best we can hope is that enough Republicans don't feel like going to the polls in support of a criminal in swing states.  \n\nBut since 1) they do this all the time and are fine with it?  and 2) they are terrified that if they don't show up to the polls and keep the Democrat out, trans atheist migrant drag queens are going to fly in through their kids windows at night and turn them gay, they _will_ show up.  \n\nWe just have to make sure to show up even more.

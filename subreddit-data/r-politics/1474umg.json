            "comment": "&gt; After losing a race for governor in November, former U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., will be nominated for an ambassador position, the White House said Wednesday. \n\n&gt; President Joe Biden intends to nominate Crist for the post of Representative of the United States of America on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization, with the rank of ambassador, according to a White House announcement.  \n\n&gt; The council is a governing body of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency that works on air-transportation policies and standards.  \n\n&gt; Crist was elected governor in 2006 as a Republican and served one term before unsuccessfully running for U.S. Senate in 2010. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House in 2016 before unsuccessfully challenging Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last year.  \n  \n&gt; The nomination to the aviation post would require U.S. Senate confirmation.",

And then he'll point to his resume as proof that he deserves a political career, as if the career was a result of the resume rather than the resume was a result of being in the club.",

I imagine there is a Jack Abramoff/Nick Naylor lobbyist club.  You bet the military ranks up generals on being in the in group.\n\nI mean, I know the people in my business, in my town.

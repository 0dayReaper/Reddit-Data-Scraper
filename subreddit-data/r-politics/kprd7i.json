According to him he has MASSIVE numbers of fraud, but the Georgia Sec-State and his office does not.\n\nWhat is Trump thinking here? \n\nDoes he think he can convince the Sec-State without also sending him the numbers Trump so blatantly claim to possess?\n\nWhat the actual fuck is the game plan here?\n\n___\n\n**31:16**\n\n* *Georgia Sec-State: \"Mr. President the problem that you have with social media, they can... People can say..\"*\n\n* *Trump: \"Nah this isn't social media, this is Trump media.\"*\n\nLol this man is legit pulling this shit out of fringe news and calling it Trump media, much more legit than social media.\n\n___\nI had to take a break here. I feel so bad for the people who have to work with this guy. How can someone be able to listen to this day in and out?\n___\n\nAfter ~30mins Trump really starts railing.\n\nThey are talking about auditors and investigators looking into the fraud, and the Georgia Sec-State offices people \"don't want to find anything, you know they don't want to find anything, everybody knows, you know.\" \n\nTrump is really angry that \"his people\" weren't allowed into the Fulton county. The county is 44% black and went 72.6% to Biden on the 2020 election, I just looked it up.\n\n___\n\n**42:50:**\n\n* Trump: \"I have to find 12'000 votes, and I have them times... a lot! And therefore I won the state\".\n\nApparently he has found these votes several times after looking at the fraud, and the Georgia Sec-States office won't give him the win. The Georgia Sec-State has absolutely no idea wtf he is talking about. Trump is growing increasingly frustrated that they won't accept his fraud allegations.\n\n___\n\n**45:00:**\n\nThey are talking about a woman named **bleep**\n\n* Trump: \"Every single ballot that she threw in the machine, at early early in the morning, went to biden.\"\n\n* Trump: \"Did you know that Ryan?\"\n\n* Ryan: \"That's not accurate mister President\".\n\n* Trump: \"huh... What is accurate?\"\n\n* *'awkward silence'*\n\nThe best awkward silence in a high level political call I have ever heard.\n\nIt's so good look it up it's amazing, I'm going mad.\n\n___\n\nTrumps frustration is getting going now, after 45:00 I think we can call this the \"meltdown\" phase.\n\nSome quips:\n\n* \"Reexamine it with people who want to find answers, not people who don't want to find answers.\"\n\n* \"I know this phone call is going nowhere, other than... other than... ultimately, you know... Look, ultimately, I win!\"\n\n___\n\nPast **54mins** now.\n\nAdults are having a conversation and trump is quiet for a minute. Talking about illegal votes and possible avenues to investigate and clear these up. The \"numbers\" are constantly being mentioned and for a brief moment the office of Georgia Sec-State and the Oval Office is actually having a conversation.\n\nTrump haven't said anything in almost a minute, and blurts: \"CERTIFIED ACCOUNTANTS LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS!\"\n\nThe adult conversation is interrupted and does not get picked up properly again.\n\n___\n\n**58:10:**\n\nThey are talking about signature verification on ballots in Fulton county. This was mentioned earlier in the call, and how the Oval Office wanted to compare signatures on 2020 ballots to 2016 ballots or earlier.\n\nSomeone on trumps team is speaking:\n\n* \"Mister President, to get through this issue of personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers of the president so that we could access that private information without you having any kind of violation\".\n\n* Trump: \"Well I don't wanna know who it is, you guys can do it very confidentially, you can sign a confidentiality agreement, that's ok, I don't need to know names\"\n\nSounds like trying to bypass privacy laws to me, I don't know much about it. They did resolve that 2 people should get together after the call and work on this avenue.\n\nI like that Trump could smell something shady and immediately jumped on board that he does not need to know names. The man sure can smell out a specific turd in a pile of shit.\n\n___\n\nAnd the call is done.\n\nI missed a lot of good stuff that was both depressing, hilarious, shady and downright pathetic. My mind is getting a bit mushy.",

He's not expecting to *convince* someone it is true, he's expecting the sec of state to understand he needs to *make it true*",

They only care about establishing a conservative dictatorship in America.\n\nThis has to stop.\n\nNancy Pelosi should refuse to seat every member of the House who backs Trump in this coup, full stop.\n\nThe Senate should impeach every Senator who backs Trump in this coup.\n\nThe DOJ should file charges of sedition against Trump and all those who follow him down this dark road. They should be put on trial and if convicted they should be imprisoned for the remained of their lives.\n\nMake no mistake, things are not going to magically go back to normal if Biden is sworn in. The Republican party has become a cult. This isn't hyperbole. They have rejected democracy and rejected science and rejected reality.

It sure as fuck isn\u2019t because they like him or are personally loyal to him.\n\nMy bet would be that there is a **shit ton** of material that is going to come out, not just about Trump, but about the GOP as a whole, IF they can\u2019t keep control of the White House. Probably to do with foreign campaign contributions (at a bare minimum - I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of other crimes to go around), which yes - anyone who has been paying attention for the last four years is not going to be surprised by. \n\nMy point is, they have nothing to lose by subverting democracy at this point - if they lose power, they are fucked and they know it. How far will a desperate man/party go to protect themselves is what we need to be concerned with. Will they actually accomplish a coup? Probably not, but suggesting that their guaranteed failure means that they won\u2019t attempt it is frankly naive and short-sighted.",

If you connect political parties to those ideals you see there the same issues we\u2019ve been having forever. Conservatives and fascists are always anti-federalists because it allows them to discriminate. That\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about. The power to disenfranchise people.",

But in 1790, the Federalist party is what we'd consider [\"classical conservatism\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_conservatism_in_the_United_States).\n\nEdit: Really to keep it simple, Federalists are considered the more conservative party since they really believed in stratification of society, that the government should be run by the learned and well-connected (ie, wealthy). They adamantly opposed the French Revolution and it's liberal populism, where as Jeffersonian Democrats were enraged that Federalists would not support the French.",

They are remarkably pro-big government when its an institution like the Senate or the EC that keeps power for them at the national level and they're pro small government when it's gerrymandering places like Wisconsin such that the Dems get 60% of the votes and 40% of the seats in the state legislature.",

It's not like former slaves and their descendents had immediate access to the same entitlements and quality of life as everybody else. They really got the shit end of the stick for a long time and still do today. A long list of toxic habits (redlining, segregation, prejudice in criminal justice, to name just a few) are the ghosts of slavery lurking in the shadows. So if anybody's serious about this, it should be called reparations for generational inequality and inequity, not just slavery. Perhaps politicians are scared of admitting fault, but that would describe the true intent a lot better.",

How does anyone actually prove their ancestors had their labor stolen by slavery? What about those that married into white families and are now mostly white? What about African Americans who came to America as immigrants after slavery ended but had hard times getting mortgages and subject to discrimination. Also places like Cali and NY passing reparation laws are just dumb. Slavery wasn\u2019t even a thing there. \n\nI think honestly the only fair thing is to provide free community college and free trade school education for those in low income neighborhoods. Now that will allow anyone stuck under the boot of a parasitic capitalist country to have an opportunity to better themselves. \n\nIf the argument is that people do drugs or commit crimes in low income communities because the only opportunity is minimum wage retail jobs then that\u2019s a solve. \n\nAnd give everyone without job insurance automatic basic healthcare. \n\nGiving people in low income neighborhoods opportunity to buy houses in that neighborhood with very low money down and low interest rates is another way to help adjust some imbalances.",

This isn't a fair \"whatabboutism\" comparison. It's actually a perfectly valid argument not against reparations but for more. What the US did to both Native Americans and Africans in the slave trade is historically appalling.

If you want laws that apply to all Americans equally and also help all Americans equally on a practical level, those disparities need to be addressed separately to create an even playing field first.\n\n(On a personal note, I don't think reparations are the way to do this.

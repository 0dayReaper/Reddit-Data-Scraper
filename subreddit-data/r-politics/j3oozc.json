Narcissists never care about things like this until it personally effects them; this is probably the best chance we have at Trump finally taking this virus seriously.  Joe being infected would undermine all that, I can already hear Trump saying \u201cLook Joe Biden wears masks but has it too, see?  Masks don\u2019t work. Etc.\u201d",

It uses the exact timestamp that Trump posts his tweets to figure out the messages. The logic being that literally everything is planned out years in advance because if it's one thing Trump is known for, it's planning in advance. Aside from it being totally disconnected from reality, it would be literally impossible to do what Qanon claims it does. They go by the exact second he posts his tweets meaning Trump would have to be in the White House or while traveling with his own fancy decoder ring deal waiting for an exact date and time to post a specific tweet for his followers to crack. There would be lag in between the time he hits send on his phone and Twitter's servers updating his account with the tweet being sent. There would be no way to coordinate this convoluted scheme just so his followers can feel special they got the secret messages.",

Despite that, Trump traveled to New Jersey for a fundraiser, where he was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters at a roundtable. His press secretary also held a briefing as normal. \n\nSo Trump and his camp learned this morning that he\u2019d had close contact all week with a known positive case, yet they continued to fundraise and carry on as-normal today, risking supporters and press? And the only way we even learned about Hope Hicks was not directly from the White House, but from an anonymous insider? \n\nHow much do people want to bet they would have tried to keep this under wraps, if not for that anonymous source?",

It wasn't a big deal\". \n\nI expect that such a turn of events would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n\n&lt;conspiracy hat&gt;So this happened right after the debate commission said they would prevent interruptions during debates, eh?&lt;/conspiracy hat&gt;",

There's no upside for that.\n\n- Trump literally just mocked Biden taking the virus seriously. The optics are horrendous.\n\n- Trump regularly boasts about being invulnerable. Admitting to a health problem and having to hide away is the opposite of what a strong man does.\n\nedit: Adding more below\n\n- Trump wants the conversation to be *anything but* COVID-19. Now that conversation is unavoidable and possibly involves his and his family's lives. The impression that Americans are getting is that *no one is safe* from the virus. \n\n- Pence is head of the coronavirus task force, so he does not look good either. If the worst happens, there is no way he would be able to rally Republicans as the biggest name on the ticket while also leading the response that killed or incapacitated his former running mate. \n\n- The economy is going to tank tomorrow because that's historically what happens when presidents announce serious illness. \n\n- This harms Trump's image as God's Chosen One to the evangelical crowd. Remember when he said this would all be over by Easter, like he had a personal line to ask favors from God?",

Anyone who cares about Healthcare will lean towards dems. Anyone who cares about a livable wage will lean towards dems.

Boomers are the \"why aren't you able to climb up here after I pulled up the ladder my parents made for me to use\" and gen x is the generation that didn't have a way of realizing things were unfair and mostly internalized the \"disappointment\" and blame from boomers. Millenials are the generation that were able to see immediate that there should have been a ladder and that it was taken. Gen z are the ones who don't even have the expectation of climbing up as a thing they're expected to do, so they're more likely to make a new ladder because they are going in without any expectation of how things should be but instead what they could be. Ok this metaphor could use work I won't lie.",

If there's anything millenials are actually probably the best at, it's online communication and computer literacy.  GenZ grew up with too many devices, they don't understand simple things like filesystems and typing the way we do, because we were raised having actual computers and having to figure a bunch of shit out, then having to explain, teach, and fix it to everyone around us.  I bet ~90% of my generation has been called a computer genius at some point in their lives, lol.  \n\nI finished college into 08, so this is after 9/11 turned the world upside down, suddenly we were going along doing as we were told (go to school, etc) and the financial crisis hits.  Then less than a decade later Trump hits, COVID hits, and Trump continues to hit.  Despite economic numbers looking good, it feels much different on the ground, not very many people are thriving, most are just trying to survive, we aren't paid enough to survive in this economy.  \n\nSo, we have been vocal about it, and, luckily GenZ listened and is doing their best to come up and try to change the system for us.",

I'm an older millenial with boomer parents, and the people there seem to be older than me, but not really my parents age.  Like, they are the age I think of when I think of my parents, despite my parents actually being in their 70s and not the kind of people that are going to be storming anything but brunch.  I see them as I remember my parents from growing up.  \n\nI know a lot of boomers who are pro Trump, but I kind of know just as many that are pretty anti-Trump, where I (ANECDOTALLY, I KNOW) see the most support is in my friends older siblings and people that age, and even some of my friends themselves, which is quite unfortunate.  \n\nSocially and culturally Trump actually makes sense for a large portion of GenX, I feel.  The apathy, anarchistic tendencies combined with the hyper commercialization of the 80s and 90s, when Trump was kind of popular and wealth was really celebrated, wrestling, etc, all just kind of screams GenX to me, like, they finally found an anarchistic movement they could get behind because of how pissed off they have been their whole lives.  \n\nNow, obviously this is a BROAD generalization, and it's going to actually be much more of a 50/50 thing in the generation as a whole.  But the support I see just feels super Made by GenX for GenX.",

Live like crap in a one bedroom apartment and eat ramen and beans and anything else where the calorie to dollar ratio is low enough.  Do this for years and years.  Then one day, the wage garnishing goes away and all the other delinquent loans drop off of your credit rating.  You have now been out of school for a decade, and during that time, despite being dirt poor, you somehow also managed to save up enough money for a down payment on a house that was foreclosed on,  then extremely inexpertly flipped in a not  particularly good neighborhood.

Since the House is capped (we need to uncap it ASAP), and the Senate is state-level this gives them an unfair advantage for both the White House and the Senate.  \n\nThey've realized that they need to stop trying to compete in NM, CO, etc and instead focus on making sure Florida, Texas et al STAY red and re-tip GA, etc back red by passing laws that make D's flee / never even show up.  The GenZ cohort all moving to states that are already D means nothing.  In a decade when we re-census maybe CA gets an extra rep in the House for the extra million+ GenZ D voters that have flocked there?  \n\nIt doesn't mean shit really that D states are getting more D votes.  The sad thing is that we NEED GenZers and GenXers to MOVE TO and STAY IN red states that are forcing them to flee....but then that means LGBTQ people getting abused, women having their rights stripped, etc.  You can't reasonably ask anyone to do it, but at the same time we NEED it.",

If that were to happen, Republicans would never win the presidency again. \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why Paxton worked furiously to toss out something like two million votes for that election, as it likely would have flipped. The country is turning bluer, and the Republicans can\u2019t stop it (although they\u2019re trying everything they can think of). The only way to drive a stake through the heart of that wretched party is to get as many Zoomers as possible to register for 2024, as this will represent the chance to do massive, massive damage to the GOP. Look at what happened last year: they thought they were locked in for another 2010-style trouncing of the Dems, and instead, younger voters showed up in droves and now Republicans are essentially neutered in the House. The war is close to being decided, but it\u2019ll require a much more forceful show of power from Millennials/Zoomers next year.",

Nixon was the worst president we'd had in modern history, according to my parents, then Reagan happened and *he* was the worst. Then Bush Sr. got us into a war for oil while I was still too young to vote, followed by Bush Jr. getting us mired into forever wars. (With Donald Rumsfeld on the side insisting we could do *land wars in the Middle East on the cheap*!)\n\nFinally, we had Trump with his absolute corruption and madness. I'm telling ya, the Republican party has been an absolute shit-show for fifty years. Even as Democrats were coming around on the environment, LGBTQ+ rights, universal health care, and other sensible policy positions, Republicans were going absolutely insane.",

That is the only way to destroy the GOP with boomers dying off everyday until the 2024 election. Politics is something that affects us all now, it\u2019s no longer a boring dinner conversation about fiscal policy when you have a political party that wants to turn the US into a Christofascist country.",

Outside the Deep South (racist to the bone) and the Great Plains (provincial farmers) the GOP is essentially dead. 40/50 years ago they would win elections in California, Colorado, Illinois and other states thst have gone true Blue. When they chose to embrace the Christian Nationalists and other knuckle draggers they destroyed both Protestant Christianity and their own party long term.",

We chased a lot of money and wasted plenty of opportunities to have that balance. Sure our 401ks are looking good and many of us are sitting on a ton of home equity. But their reality, safety net and opportunities are very different from ours. The bootstraps speeches don\u2019t work with this crowd. They speak up in situations where a lot of us played blind. Sure they at times infuriate my sense of duty and save today for tomorrow outlook but I for one can learn from them. I passed on a lot trips and get togethers out of loyalty to a job that would replace me in five minutes.",

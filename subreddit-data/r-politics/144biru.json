Mark Meadows had not voted against Boehner on the House floor. But he had participated in the plotting\u2014and word had since leaked out naming him as one of the conspirators. Frightened that he would be exiled to the hinterlands of the House, the freshman sought an audience with the speaker.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s on the couch, sitting across from me in my chair, and suddenly he slides off the couch, down onto his knees, and puts his hands together in front of his chest,\u201d Boehner recalled to me. \u201cHe says, \u2018Mr. Speaker, will you please forgive me?\u2019\u201d (This incident was witnessed by several people, including Boehner\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Sommers, who described it as \u201cthe strangest behavior I had ever seen in Congress.\u201d)\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/04/mark-meadows-trump-covid-425912",

That's the only key piece that would make it so they wouldn't vote for removal while he was President because it means they are tied to that decision in consideration to what his supporters would see. Given how cowardly their leaders have consistently been within the presence of Trump or anything involving him, it seems like if we follow the coward line to its logical conclusion, it would stand to reason that Trump getting indicted and potentially convicted lets them not *officially* be in favor of Trump going away, ergo salvaging as much from his voters as they can. It also completely removes the burden and shifts it onto the DoJ who is being led by an appointee from a Democrat.\n\nBecause you gotta remember, they are alllllll cowards. Ya gotta always think \"what would a stereotypical coward do in this instance?\"",

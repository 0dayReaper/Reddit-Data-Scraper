He doesn't suddenly become a good manager, or a good business owner. His sales accumen carries him through the whole thing, and it's his sales accumen that finds the pressure point in that negotiation. He gets lucky as fuck because if it wasn't in the middle of the financial crisis, Wallace wouldn't have been open to such strong arming or even making a buyout, but still Michael uses only what he's good at and wins. Then to top it all off, he makes the mature choice to take jobs instead of a payout.",

They don't have to sell if they don't want to and can only lose the money they already spent. If they're happy to watch the stock plummet down to $0, they can just keep holding it out of spite however long it takes.\n\nShortseller: Someone who **borrows** a stock from someone else with interest. They then sell it with the idea that the price will go down and they can buy it back before the person they borrowed it from calls on them to return it. They pay interest the entire time they have the loaned stock out, and the higher it goes the more money they lose. If they borrowed a $2 stock and it's now $420.69, they're out $418.69 per stock if they buy it now + some fraction of that for every day they have delayed. They have a limited pool of money called a margin, and they **must** buy before the stock is so expensive they can't afford it with their margin.",

The reason much of the industry went commission free was because they take kickbacks from a market maker like Citadel to let them handle the execution order flow so that they can enhance liquidity and manipulate price spreads in their favor. It's very technical to explain in detail, but it results in robinhood users not getting best possible prices on their order executions, but hey \"free commission.\" Studies have already been done and successful traders still make more money paying commissions to a direct-access broker who isn't incentivized to bake pennies into the spread, and execute their order immediately instead of spending valuable moments trying to fill it from a dark pool.",

Gamestop is a prominent name in a big industry that brought in new management so there absolutely was a bullish case to make after they were already beaten into the ground.

They quite simply over-leveraged themselves on shitty financial positions and are reaping what they sow. And now they are trying to manipulate the market to avoid the consequences of their actions because they know the losses from government agencies penalties will not outweigh the losses of being held accountable in the free market.",

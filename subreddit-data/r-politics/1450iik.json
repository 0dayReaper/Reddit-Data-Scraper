A change that ensures our youngsters understand the gravity of climate change from multiple perspectives.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately the world we live in comes with naysayers who, instead of acknowledging the gravity of climate change, spread false narratives about it. This reality reminds us of the importance of our participation. Every voice matters. Each one of us can play a role in the decisions that shape our future. Our democratic right to vote isn't just about picking a president; it's about supporting politicians and policies that promote sustainability.\r  \n\r  \nRight now, we have a golden chance to re-introduce the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/get-loud-take-action/energy-innovation-act/). It\u2019s a policy that could play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our participation is needed now more than ever.  If you're in the NE US a quick glance at the AQI tells us that climate change is already at our doorsteps.\r  \n\r  \nI encourage you to join initiatives like the [Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/) and [Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=online-035&amp;utm_source=online&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=035) if you\u2019re in the US. Remember, it\u2019s not too late. The planet can still be saved, but it's a rapidly closing window of opportunity. We need to act NOW. We can't afford to be spectators, folks; it's time to get in the game! Let's stand up for our home, Earth! Let's stand up for our future generations!",

All mammals have this prion protein, and genetics can correlate with a stronger \"resistance\" to their forming apparently.\n\nSo, I'm over worried about the possibility, but I can't find anything to agree or disagree with it.

Soon we will see kids being taught about how Washington was inspired by a vision of Donald Trump to beat back the British, and how Hitler was misunderstood, and how it was unfair for the liberal north to beat down the south and take away slavery. \n\n\u201cThe very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common. Instead of altering their views to fit the facts, they alter the facts to fit their views...which can be very uncomfortable if you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho controls the past controls the future.

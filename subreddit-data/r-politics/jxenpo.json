It was aimed at preventing Black voters, who previously were required to take literacy tests to qualify to vote, from uniting behind one candidate and electing that candidate via the popular vote. White voters, meanwhile, would be afforded a chance to regroup after the first vote and collectively back one candidate.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-crow-era-law-could-determine-whether-democrats-or-republicans-control-the-senate-11604689792",

Buying a plate carrier and an AR-15 doesn\u2019t make you a soldier, it makes you an actor playing a bit part. \n\nThese cowards would literally piss their pants if the bullets started flying. I\u2019ve seen it before. All the privates fresh out of BCT who liked to talk shit about going on a killing rampage ended up either sobbing in a ditch trying their hardest to assimilate into the Iraqi dirt via osmosis, or stuck in the doorway of an MRAP with their legs refusing to take one step outside their armored safe space.\n\nFuck every last one of them. They\u2019re a bunch of stolen valor craven chickenhawks.",

I hope the ceremony takes place indoors, with no more people than are absolutely necessary, and is broadcast on the internet.\n\nAnd then I hope Biden tweets that his online crowd was bigger than Trump's.

There were bins for Trump, Biden, the libertarian chick, write-in, and no vote.\n\nWhen the stacks were around 50 pages high, they were fed into the counting machines to count each stack. The machines literally just counted the ballots, there was no scanning of them.\n\nSo it was humans who decided who the vote was for, but machines decided how many votes.\n\nI know this because the secretary of state described how the process would work. It was a pointless waste of time and the outcome was as expected.",

Why do you think Trump is having the members of the Michigan GOP legislature to the White House tomorrow? Why did Trump install loyalists in the Defense dept? This is calculated. He might not be successful, but he's absolutely going to try and simply be \"installed\", if he can't be elected. And if it tears the country apart, so be it. He doesn't care, he just cares about \"winning\". Or rather, \"not losing\".",

I sincerely worried it was a ploy to not certify the results in time for tomorrow.\n\nEvery step of this process has had me terrified, and at every step Raffensperger has shown that he is respectable, and doing the right thing, and yet, knowing that, I will forever be worried when something like this happens in Georgia. 2018, and Brian Kemp have forever tarnished my belief in the state to fairly, and accurately report the results. To further complicate matters, Perdue, and Loeffler are currently protesting the GA SoS, and complaining that he isn\u2019t correctly doing his job which has me even further worried that this, an election with an accurate count, is atypical in Georgia. Their behavior is not going to discourage me from voting, it will only cause me unnecessary stress when I do vote but, once again, it will never stop me. If anything, this only further reinforces my belief, and, I\u2019m sure, the belief of others that Kemp misreported results in 2018, especially given that he conveniently lost the proof, and backup of the proof when a court ordered him to provide it.\n\nI hope that Raffensperger fully understands why many voters don\u2019t trust him , especially in this state, and I sincerely hope that he understands that, through his actions alone, he is singlehandedly helping to repair that once broken trust, in spite of massive opposition from his very own party. Raffensperger is choosing his state, and the country over his own party, and that is such an unexpected, and astonishing feat from a Republican that even when shown proof that he is, in fact, doing the right thing, it is almost impossible to believe.\n\nSadly, Raffensperger is a Republican, and as such I will likely never completely trust him. I will, forever more, require proof from any Republican before I believe them, and they will never again have my full trust. Prior to Obama\u2019s presidency I, at the very least, thought Republicans cared about the country, and all of its inhabitants, now, without question, it is known that they care only for themselves, and it saddens me greatly that too many, having mountains of evidence in front of them, still vote for the evil, and greedy bastards.\n\nRaffensperger is unique, in that he is an honorable Republican, however, that is like saying \u201cwell, he was a good man as well as a Nazi.\u201d He may be honorable but, he has still chosen to be a member of a party which holds the beliefs, and \u201cvalues\u201d of the current GOP.\n\nI hope that Raffensperger has begun the search for a new career, because I fear that his days as a representative, in any capacity, as an elected official in the state of Georgia is about to come to a halt unless he switches parties.",

            "comment": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has asked for more time to file annual financial disclosures following criticism that he failed to report luxury travel and real estate deals with a Texas billionaire and Republican donor.\r  \n\r  \nThomas\u2019s request for an extension was made public Wednesday, along with disclosure reports filed by his court colleagues. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. also asked for an extension as he has done in previous years.\r  \n\r  \nThe Supreme Court is under increasing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and transparency advocates to strengthen disclosure rules and adopt ethics guidelines specific to the justices after news reports revealed Thomas\u2019s undisclosed real estate deals and private jet travel, and raised questions about the recusal practices of both conservative and liberal justices.\n\nThomas\u2019s 2022 filing was highly anticipated after ProPublica reported on the justice\u2019s financial dealings with his close friend and benefactor, the Texas businessman Harlan Crow. Instead, Thomas will have up to 90 additional days to submit his filing, which could include any amendments or updates related to his finances from past years.\r  \n\r  \nRevised ethics rules adopted in March require the justices \u2014 and all federal judges \u2014 to provide a fuller public accounting of the free trips and other gifts they accept. The changes make clear, for instance, that judges must report travel by private jet. The revised rules were also designed to clarify which gifts can be counted as \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d from a close friend and exempt from disclosure.\n\n**Read more or skip the paywall with email registration: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/07/supreme-court-justice-disclosures-clarence-thomas/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_source=reddit.com**",

The funny thing about Thomas is that the guy is atleast honest about his capacity on the supreme court \u2014 he doesn\u2019t engage in oral arguments b/c he knows how everyone is going to vote *anyway*. And he understands that the supreme court *is* a political institution. \n\nMany of the other justices are just as guilty if corruption as Thomas because the supreme court as a whole is a questionable institution. This claim of \u201ci\u2019m not biased by anything, I\u2019m a man of justice\u201d is a joke from no matter what side you look at it. To be clear i\u2019m not defending Thomas, he\u2019s a pos, but they all are. The supreme court is debate lord heaven, and if they can destroy an argument and redefine congressional law via the redefinition of a single word, they will, and the impact of some rich guy is secondary to that accomplishment.",

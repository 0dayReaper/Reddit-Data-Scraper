Complaining about how Mr. Corcoran had been compelled to testify in the documents investigation, he said: \u201cThey bring attorneys in as though they\u2019re, you know, witnesses to a case. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be that way.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to this.",

He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn\u2019t that amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this thing just came up. Look. This was him,\u201d Trump says, according to the transcript. \u201cThey presented me this \u2013 this is off the record, but \u2013 they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at some. This was him. This wasn\u2019t done by me, this was him.\u201d  \nTrump continues: \u201cAll sorts of stuff \u2013 pages long, look. Wait a minute, let\u2019s see here. I just found, isn\u2019t that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know. Except it is like, highly confidential. Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this.\u201d\n\nFirst, the papers as Trump describes them don't prove Trump's case, at all. But I think it's more interesting that Trump obviously knew he had those plans, he retrieved them so he could show them to the biographers to \"prove\" his point, but he tries to sell it like a happy accident. Not really sure where I'm going with this, but it feels potentially legally relevant that Trump clearly had at least some idea of what classified materials he kept, and where they were.",

That exception is a provision of the law that allows prosecutors to work around the normal protections of attorney-client privilege if they have reason to believe and can demonstrate to a judge that a client used legal advice to further a crime.\n\nThough I am not a lawyer, my understanding is that it means more than just that, it means that they have reason to believe the attorney might be complicit, which leads to leverage the DOJ can use to compel his testimony, granting him immunity from prosecution. I'd bet money that that's why he sang.\n\n...that and the prior history of Trump's lawyers going to jail of course.",

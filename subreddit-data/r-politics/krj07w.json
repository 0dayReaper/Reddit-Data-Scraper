I don't believe our state legislature was involved.\n\nRaffensperger and Kemp got Biden's win certified pretty quickly once the recounts were finished, so if Ossoff can get a 0.5 lead and eliminate the possibility of a recount, that'll help speed things up. He's at 0.29 right now.\n\n*edit*. \n\nJust saw that Perdue's campaign put out a statement that they believe they won and will pursue \"every available resource and exhaust every recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted\u201d.\n\nBut then, Trump's people said the same thing, and look where it got them.",

Though voter suppression occurred and she likely would have won without incumbents interfering with the election in various ways, Abrams used the unfairness of that loss to launch Fair Fight Action which ultimately overcame all of those suppression tactics and flipped the state to the blue it wanted to be. She is the sole reason the Senate will be under Democratic majority for at least the next 2 years. Frankly, she can do anything she wants, but I want her to use her talents to spread these powerful voter registration efforts across America in ways that can overwhelm any suppression attempts.",

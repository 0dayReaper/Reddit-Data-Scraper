This has been their end game since at least the 1950s. Check out the following books to get a real detailed look at it all. \n\n[Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind The Secret Plan To Steal America's Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26889647-ratf-ked) It goes into great detail on how after Obama got elected the republican party decided to gerrymander as many states as they could in order to take control of the states. \n\n[Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61398888-birchers?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=pP3y7ss0wq&amp;rank=1) This one goes into detail on how rich capitalists didn't like things like the New Deal and workers right, so banded together to push a more capitalist ideal. This one goes into great detail on the birth of Bircherism, and how it and the groups that members later founded took over the GOP over the years.\n\n[Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833494-dark-money?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=vx7m5ApfcZ&amp;rank=1) This one goes into further detail on how the rich mentioned above used their money to influence the GOP, and helped guide it to what it is today. \n\n[Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30011020-democracy-in-chains?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=BmzWbbXSC0&amp;rank=1) This one goes into detail on what the long term plans were/are, and how they were implemented in other countries, and how they're being implemented in the US now. \n\n[Troll Nation: How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Rat-F*cking Liberals, America, and Truth Itself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36955076-troll-nation?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=yUmTAFAw4B&amp;rank=2) More of the same, but this one focuses on the years running up to and during the Trump administration. \n\n[Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231774-republic-of-spin?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=AUqScZFBvh&amp;rank=1) While this one doesn't focus solely on the actions of the GOP and those manipulating the party, it does show how the media has been used to help get the GOP to where it is today.",

The problem is that as people say \"Protect us or lose us\", their local society has been choosing \"lose us\".

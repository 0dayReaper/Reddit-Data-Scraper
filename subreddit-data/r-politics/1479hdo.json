That will have significant consequences in the long term if the pattern of obstruction continues, particularly when it comes to funding the government and avoiding a shutdown in the fall.\n\nThere will be no shutdown in the fall. If the House doesn't pass the appropriations bills, defense takes an automatic cut (it's part of the debt ceiling deal, and one of the reasons why the Freedom Caucus threw a fit over the deal).",

If lawmakers have not approved all 12 regular funding bills by the end of the year, the agreement tightens its spending caps. Nondefense discretionary spending would be set at one percent below current year levels, and it is possible that the I.R.S. would not see its $10 billion in funding for next year repurposed for other programs.\n\n&gt;The same levels would apply to defense and veterans\u2019 spending \u2014 which would be, in effect, a significant cut to those programs compared to the agreed-upon caps. Democrats see the looming military cuts as a particularly strong incentive for Republicans to strike a deal to pass appropriations bills by the end of the year.",

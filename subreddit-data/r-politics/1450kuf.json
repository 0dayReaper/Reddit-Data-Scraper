The ability for a people to defend themselves is a counter to greater death and suffering that can be observed even today around the globe. Innocent people dying is awful and there are no places on this planet absent of the cruelties of our fellow man. The scale of death and suffering are not apparent to those in ivory towers in the west.  \n\n\n There are even in recent years governments intentionally targeting their people indiscriminately with chemical weapons. That leader President Bashar al-Assad of Syria caused the death of 500,000 people. He is still alive and the UN is doing nothing about him and are going as far as letting him decide how aid packages are to be distributed. \n\nRussia invaded Ukraine again on the orders of Putin and at the onset of the invasion we saw normal citizens being handed weapons , given essentially no training before they were sent to the front lines to defend their country. This desperate act combined with foreign aid and  Russian incompetence has kept Ukraine in the fight. The losses on both sides are staggering. In a year there are an estimated 350,000+ as of a couple months ago. That's  before the counteroffensive happening now that's turning into a meat grinder.\n\nWe don't like horrible random acts of violence in the U.S. , there are things to be improved , yet we are not likely to be invaded or subjected to a genocide  by our own government in the immediate future.",

The 300k deaths I mentioned are a fraction of the total deaths  which are well over 1 million Americans at this point.  That 300k number is the estimated number of extra deaths that the anti vax and pro plague party caused. Those deaths were caused by MAGA spite. If you want to \"do your own research,\" You can google this topic and you'll find that it was widely reported and the source generally available.\n\nedit2: To the other seemingly shadow banned anti vaxxer while it is true that a small number of  the over 600 millin Americans that were vaccinated had negative reactions to it, the vast majority of people did not. The benefits far outweigh the risk. I could not find any evidence of actual deaths due to the vaccine but even if there are the  benefit far outweighs the cost.  Bark at me again if you've got reputable sources on deaths caused by the vaccine.",

Hannity thought his job was to defend Trump and bash Joe Biden, which isn't what legitimate interviewers on legitimate networks do.\n\nMoreover, Hannity was impervious to facts. He would gush about the record low unemployment under Trump but then dismiss the fact that unemployment is lower under Biden.",

I would just point at that even without Covid, job growth in Trump\u2019s first 3 years was lower than job growth in Obama\u2019s last 3 years. That\u2019s a fair, apples to apples comparison with no anomalies to show that Trump wasn\u2019t a \u201cjobs president\u201d, or at least not a better one than Obama. \n\nBut now that I think about it, I *will* start taking 2020 into account, because we can pin the blame on the *extremity* of job loss squarely on him. Maybe not the specter of job loss entirely, because that happened everywhere in the world, but what could have been hundreds of thousands of jobs lost became millions of jobs lost *because* of Trump. \n\nGutting the pandemic response team because he felt they were \u201cgetting paid to do nothing\u201d as if he doesn\u2019t understand the need for something to be on standby *in case* something happens. It\u2019d be like abolishing the fire department because a house hadn\u2019t caught on fire in a while. \n\nBut then, as you pointed out, letting the pandemic run wild in blue cities because they didn\u2019t vote for him. Well, where are all the jobs at in the US?! Not Bumblefuck, Alabama, that\u2019s for sure. They\u2019re in NYC, Chicago, LA, Boston, San Francisco, Atlanta, etc. The big cities. Something like 70% of the US GDP is generated in blue areas.  And he let Covid ravage those cities because they didn\u2019t vote for him. It wasn\u2019t until red areas started getting clapped by Covid that he started to care. \n\nSo yea, if letting a lot more people die than necessary because they didn\u2019t vote for you is your policy, then the effects of that policy are on you too.",

But I was much more likely to make it to the table because of stuff outside of my control, like my skin colour, my height, my parents\u2019 income, health, genetics, and where I was born.\n\nThat *privilege* I grew up with means that though I\u2019m not a filthy rich trust fund kid, I was significantly more likely to end up where I am compared to someone else who didn\u2019t get the supports I did growing up. Just the fact that I wasn\u2019t constantly stopped by cops who thought I was a criminal for my skin colour is huge.\n\nThis also means that if it comes to a revolution - and given the current lack of willingness to make meaningful change on wealth inequality, something which is becoming more likely - people like me will be the ones who are killed and who have their houses burned down while the multi-millionaires and billionaires fly off in their private jets to their apocalypse bunkers.",

Until covid, and nothing related to that can be his fault.\n\nBut Biden inherited a post-Covid economy, and those numbers are Biden's fault. But the economy bouncing back under Biden is not his accomplishment.",

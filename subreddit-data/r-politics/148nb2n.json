I\u2019m scared stupid of what is coming next and I\u2019m angry because I have always voted democrat, on every single election in every single election for every single level of office from school boards to presidents since 1987 when I turned 18. I\u2019m furious absolutely furious about how stupid people have become. I have marched, I have protested, I have been to rallies for various different causes for years and I\u2019ve never been so angry about the state of our country as I am now! I remember Live Aid and Farm Aid and Comic Relief and all the other organizations that were able to do so much good for so many!

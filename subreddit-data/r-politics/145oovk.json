She's a Trump appointee who has already shown favoritism to him twice, that makes it very hard for the right to argue she's biased against him, or that a guilty verdict is politically motivated. More importantly, she already fucked around and found out, so she knows the 11th Circuit won't put up with any of her bullshit. She'll be under a microscope and the indictment seems extremely damning, which hopefully will force her to act professionally.\n\nI'm not happy, but Smith had to have considered the possibility she might get the case. I've no doubt the prosecutors are prepared for her stunts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Cannon could have a significant role in the case, including whether to set a trial date before the November 2024 election. She could also rule on motions to dismiss counts \u2014 or the entire indictment \u2014 and determine which evidence could be excluded. Those rulings are generally subject to appeal and review by higher courts.\n\nI'm glad Smith said he expects this to go fast. I'm worried about what she'll allow, but the fact it can be appealed gives me hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The conservative judge was nominated by Trump in 2020 and received some Democratic support at her hearing, when 12 Senate Democrats voted in favor of her confirmation. She was one of 14 Trump nominees confirmed after he lost the November 2020 election.\n\nWhy the fuck did 12 Dems vote for a Federalist Society nominee?! The Republicans don't need to do anything, Dems screw themselves.",

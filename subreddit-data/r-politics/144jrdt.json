            "comment": "&gt;Throughout his life, Mr. Trump has treated every challenge to him like an ongoing negotiation. His impulse is to go directly to the person he considers the top official of an organization to lodge his complaints. That was the case when the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was appointed in 2017; Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had to stop him from trying to reach out directly to Mr. Mueller to argue his case.\nBy broadcasting his complaints on social media rather than making them in court papers to a judge, Mr. Trump avoided the normal method of lodging accusations about prosecutorial misconduct \u2014 a method that, of course, also puts a burden of veracity and accuracy on the accuser.\n\n\nThe last half of the article they do a good job of laying out a pattern of his legal strategy to file complaints to the head of the organization in charge while using the media to manipulate the perception of accusations being filed.",

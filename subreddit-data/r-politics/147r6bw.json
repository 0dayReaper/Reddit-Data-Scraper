His sexuality is the worst kept secret, but he's deathly afraid that if it comes out his scumfuck voters will turn on him. And you know, he might be right on that.\n\nBut, the even more insane thing is, nobody needs to blackmail him. He requires no extra incentive to kiss ass. He just naturally grovels and submits to a stronger personality, since he has no spine or morals. When John McCain was alive, Graham was his lapdog, so he acted like Mini McCain. Then on pure instinct he became Trump's lapdog, so he acted like a Mini Trump. He just naturally plays the role of a petty minion orbiting a more charismatic politician, hoping to be fed some table scraps if he's a good boy.",

There is no other force in that moral universe. \n\nThis is why every argument you have with these people is frustrating nonsense. They don't have a consistent set of beliefs you can interact with. They have slogans. \n\nWhat's true today is handed down by people above you, and if they belong above you, they must be better than you. In every way. Because there's only the one metric. Someone clever can't just be wrong, since that would require an objective means to evaluate claims. That is not what claims are for, in this default tribal worldview. They can only be accepted or rejected based on interpersonal trust. \n\nYou perform loyalty by finding whatever sequence of words might justify the latest conclusion. Consistency means less than nothing. It's an obstacle to making good moves in this word game. You don't use the same words as yesterday for the same reason you don't make the same moves in two rounds of poker. You shuffle your cards and play whatever's likely to work. \n\nAnd I say \"you\" because they think that's all we're doing. They think that's all there is.",

A jury of his peer will decide his fate with the evidence presented. \n\nIt's been almost two years without Trump facing any charges -- Maybe in time Biden's time will come. Like Mueller said during Trumps presidency \"You cannot indict a sitting President\"\n\nOur law system SHOULD go after anyone regardless of status but that hasn't been the case in our country...This is a step in the right direction for all Americans",

I think what many people don\u2019t know or choose to ignore is that the national archives started asking for the governments documents back systematically for over a year before a search warrant was issued. They exhausted every other method of retrieving the governments property from trump. \nIn the cases of Biden and pence, the national archives took the same steps to retrieve documents that were found with those two and those two immediately took action to return them. \nIf Biden or pence had not turned them over or obstructed the retrievals, they would be in this boat as well.",

Boxes stacked throughout the house and would show classified information to guests to brag. \n\nWhile Biden and pence had documents, trump was throwing them around like dollar bills at a strip club. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nAnd the shit trump had access to is heavily classified and could compromise national security if the wrong person got a hold of it. And trump was the wrong person",

            "comment": "&gt;&gt;They also testified that firearms that shoot more than one round without having to reload were rare at the time the Second Amendment was ratified 1791 \n\nThat is pretty irrelevant. Electronic communication was nonexistant at the time and 1st and 4th amendment protections extend to those. We don't base constitutional protections based on technology of the time and this was already addressed by the Supreme Court in a unanimous per curiam decision in Caetano. They ruled that stun guns were protected even though they didn't exist until the 70s.",

That $409k works out to about $830 for each Maricopa-based legislator over the course of these 83 days, and $9877 for legislators living outside Maricopa (a sub-group that is noticeably more Republican than the state legislature as a whole).\n\n&gt; To be fair, Arizona lawmakers are paid just $24,000 a year.\n\nRaising this probably will cut down on these kinds of baseless prolonged adjournments going forward.",

They historically had very limited number of days in session, and could have planned legislative sessions as rarely as every other year.\n\nIn reality, the world has become increasing complex with time-sensitive issues arising continuously outside of those planned sessions and many such states rely heavily on special sessions and such.  And despite the stated opposition to career politicians, many are filled with longtime incumbents whose primary job is indeed politics, and they\u2019re sustained heavily by investments and lobbyists in areas they have a direct role in legislating over.\n\nSo in short, people won\u2019t accept reality as it already is.  Politics is a fulltime job for many, and for those that it isn\u2019t, absenteeism rates are absurdly high even with the short number of scheduled days in session.  My state legislature frequently operated without the required quorum and basically just pretended it had it by doing unrecorded voice votes.  I also remember Texas being notorious for extensive proxy voting, often potentially fraudulent since congresspeople were frequently hitting buttons for anyone in range including across party lines where they may not have had explicit permission.  Idk if texas even permits proxy voting in its congressional code to begin with.  In any event, you can find amusing videos of it set to Benny Hill music.",

My old legislative district included a married couple trying to raise a kid and pay off their student loans on their pooled legislative salaries and someone who has had to maintain her 2nd job as an EMT throughout her time in the legislature, which has caused her sometimes to not make it to votes. The neighboring district has a Dem. State Rep. who works 3 jobs - the leg., a position as a paralegal, and intermittent part-time shifts at Trader Joe's.",

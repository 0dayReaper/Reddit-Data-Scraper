                            "comment": "I know that I'm that late on this, but I figured I'd throw in my findings:\n\nJust want to point out that right-wing extremist violence has been on the rise over the course of Trump's presidency. In fact overall, the **vast majority of domestic terrorist, political, hate-crime violence** has been committed by the Right. This is not a \"both sides\" issue. \n\nLet me unpack this further and not mince words:\n\nYou see, conservatives have always been responsible for the VAST majority of violence in our nation, from the treasonous confederates fighting for slavery, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands, not to mention those whom they exploited; then you've got the 4,000+ *documented* lynchings per NAACP, clinic bombings, and all the hate crimes on Hispanics and Muslims and Sikhs (who look Muslim... not really).\n\nRemember the Oklahoma City bomber that killed a bunch children in a daycare with his attack, Timothy McVeigh? He was a lunatic nut-job who disagreed with law-enforcement and their crackdown on Waco and Ruby Ridge and all those lunatic soverign citizens/religious nut-jobs/\"free folk\". Ultra right-wing conservative extremists.\n\nBasically, he was the same sort of dumbass as the Bundy crew terrorists who did an armed takeover of a Federal facility in Oregon while also holding their ground against law-enforcement in Nevada ([Watch this Documentary covering these terrorists](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/american-patriot-inside-the-armed-uprising-against-the-federal-government/)). \n\nIt's places like ~~td~~ red-hat-snowflake-zone that instigate domestic terrorism. And fun fact: For the past 16+ years, radical right-wing conservative groups have been a larger threat **[per the FBI](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/14/fbi-and-dhs-warned-of-growing-threat-from-white-supremacists-months-ago/)** than any other domestic group. Moreover, radical right-wingers have [killed *far* more people in the U.S. since Trump's election than any foreigner or Muslim.](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-terrorism-islam)\n\nAnd whaddyaknow, [Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter was both a gun nut and of the *exact* same breed as Bundy and McVeigh:](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzk8dx/las-vegas-shooter-ranted-about-gun-control-and-right-wing-conspiracies-weeks-before-the-massacre)\n\n&gt;Another woman recalled overhearing a man that looked like Paddock talking to another man at a restaurant in las Vegas days before the massacre. She told police that **Paddock was ranting about two separate events that took place in the 1990s**. One was the standoff at **Ruby Ridge**, Idaho, in 1992, where a right-wing activist resisting federal weapons charges moved with his family to a remote cabin, leading to an 11-day armed standoff with authorities. The other was the 51-day standoff in **Waco, Texas**, between a Christian cult and police, which led to the deaths of more than 80 people, including 22 children. \n\nand\n\n&gt;One man told the FBI and police that less than one month before the massacre, Paddock responded to his online ad selling schematics which showed how to transform your semi-automatic rifle to make it fire like an automatic weapon. \u201cSomebody has to wake up the American public and get them to arm themselves,\u201d the man recalled Paddock saying during their meeting outside a Las Vegas sporting goods store. \u201cSometimes sacrifices have to be made.\u201d \n\n(Very odd, also, how Vegas police tried to keep these documents locked up.)\n\nThese kind of people are amped up by the rhetoric from Trump. When Trump tells them to commit violence at his rallies ([Source 1](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/donald-trump-incitement-violence/) [Source 2](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/05/sarah-huckabee-sanders/has-donald-trump-never-promoted-or-encouraged-viol/)), eventually, someone will do it. Not long ago, we had a [\"Florida Man who Threatened to Kill Democrats and 'Weak Republicans' Over Kavanaugh Nomination\"](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-man-threats-to-kill-congress-kavanaugh_us_5bb77dfbe4b028e1fe3d3650), saying:\n\n&gt;\u201cI can\u2019t do this by myself, I need more conservatives going into liberal homes at night killing them in their sleep,\u201d Patrick said.\n\n[From Snopes:](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/08/17/are-antifa-and-the-alt-right-equally-violent/) \n\n&gt;Over the past decade, extremists of every stripe have killed 372 Americans. **74 percent of those killings were committed by right wing extremists. Only 2 percent of those deaths were at the hands of left wing extremists. Mayo told us:**\n\n&gt;\"I don\u2019t want to give moral equivalence to the two sides because one side is fighting against white supremacy.  On the Antifa side, they\u2019ve never murdered anyone but there have been many murders done by white supremacists, so we have to be concerned about that movement.\"\n\nWhen the right-wing psycho emboldened by Trump supporters chanting with Lowes tiki-torches, \"jews will not replace us\" ran over peaceful protesters, killing one, what did Trump do? Muddy the waters and say it was \"both sides.\" No. \n\nOf course, you have the [MAGABomber](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/cesar-sayoc-bombing-suspect-arrested.html) and the [Pittsburgh lunatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_synagogue_shooting) as just more examples of right-wing extremism recently, among countless others I cannot keep up with. \n\nConservatives love to pretend that those tree-huggin' bleedin'-heart peace-lovin' anti-gun hippies are somehow deranged murderers!! Whoops. Are they snowflakes, or they are they literally Hitler...? So when they point to cases of liberal violence, sometimes they're right, but as always they play the game of false-equivalence (I literally had two separate Trump supporters equating leftists protesting by blocking highways and boycotting restaurants supportive of Trump to the murders of the right). If they want to play the game of who can list the most tragedies, the statistics outright prove I'll win in showing conservatives are more violent in America.\n\nMeanwhile, you have 45% of Americans somehow approving of this President, [23% of Republicans who wouldn't prosecute Trump if he shot James Comey in cold blood](https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PPP_Release_National_61318.pdf) (page 47)\u2014then you have [43% of Republicans as of 2015 who are still so incredibly ignorant that they believe Obama is a Muslim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/14/a-startling-number-of-americans-still-believe-president-obama-is-a-muslim/?utm_term=.005757f8ffb7), [51% of Republicans as of 2017 who still think Obama is Kenyan-born](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-birther-obama-poll-republicans-kenya-744195). If you cannot connect the dots between the blatant ignorance and hatred revealed by these studies, and the increased tick in violence at this point today\u2014then you're frankly not paying attention. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, that really is the problem: people aren't paying attention. People aren't calling out ignorance when they see it, and letting it slide and being \"polite\" and holding your tongue leaves these people into delusions that they have it all figured out. Meanwhile Fox News, Right-Wing Radio, the Bannon/Jones-types of the internet and so forth *feed* this uninformed audience what they want to hear; they're gullible and easily manipulated into believing whatever is needed in the moment for political expediency. *Why* do these talking-heads manipulate your crazy Uncle, your conspiracy-loving teenage neighbor, your dad on long trips? Like most corrupt things, it's about money &amp; power. They're profiting off ignorance and fear. It's a scary tragic reality.\n\nThis all should all lead to a big question: **Why does the Conservative Ideology inherently attract or create more violence?** We should all be wondering that, but some of my thoughts on this can be [read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lennybird/comments/clrrbr/differences_in_political_ideology_empathy/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)",

Extracts from link above.\n\n&gt; Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The Richmond Enquirer editorialized that Sumner should be caned \"every morning\", praising the attack as \"good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences\" and denounced \"these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate\" who \"have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission.\" Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. One was inscribed \"Hit him again.\"\n\nThe 'conservatives' of that time bear little difference with the right wing of today.\n\n&gt; Southerners mocked Sumner, claiming he was faking his injuries.[38] They argued that the cane Brooks used was not heavy enough to inflict severe injuries.[39] They also claimed that Brooks had not hit Sumner more than a few times, and had not hit him hard enough to cause serious health concerns.[40] In fact, Sumner suffered head trauma that caused him chronic, debilitating pain for the rest of his life and symptoms consistent with what is now called traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder; he spent three years convalescing before returning to his Senate seat.[41]\n\nYep.\n\n&gt; Brooks claimed that he had not intended to kill Sumner, or else he would have used a different weapon.[42] In a speech to the House defending his actions, Brooks stated that he \"meant no disrespect to the Senate of the United States\" or the House by his attack on Sumner.[43] Brooks was arrested for the assault.[44] He was tried in a District of Columbia court, convicted, and fined $300 ($8,540 in today's dollars), but received no prison sentence.",

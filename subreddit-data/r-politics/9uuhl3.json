She is the true defender of morality when it comes to marriage apparently.  You might need to make a chart to understand it:\n\n&gt; Davis has been married four times to three different men.[18][183] The first three marriages ended in divorce in 1994, 2006, and 2008. Davis has two daughters from her first marriage and twins, a son and another daughter, who were born five months after her divorce from her first husband.[184] Her third husband is the biological father of the twins. They were adopted by her current husband, Joe Davis, who was also her second husband;[7][59] he supports her stance against same-sex marriage.[58]",

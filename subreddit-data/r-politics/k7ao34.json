The first person who gets the money gets the most benefit because they get to choose the direction of the money.  Companies will too often use the money to benefit other companies first and each company profit takes and it cycles through rich people awhile before they get down to the working class.\n\nTrickle up economics drives the economy just as much, except that the workers give the money to companies that benefit them the most.  So, workers get the most benefit and companies have to perform to get benefit.",

You could try rocking to get some momentum or just hope you're strong enough to push yourself up despite having a few rich people sitting on your back.\n\nOf course, the best way to stand back up is to have some one give you a hand.  Then you can give a hand to the person beside you.  Eventually, everyone is standing and anyone who falls is back up quickly.  But, apparently Conservative Jesus says \"fuck that!  Suffering is good for them! Selfishness rules!\"",

Something like $1 in direct stimulus produces $1.50 or something in economic activity.\n\nConversely, tax cuts or stimulus to the very wealthy or corporations typically only produces about $0.50 of economic activity for every dollar in stimulus.

Someone living paycheck to paycheck doesn't generally have the luxury of being able to put that check away for savings; it will normally get used to pay off bills or buy necessities *now*, giving an immediate boost to the economy *on top of* being a humanitarian act.\n\nThat's a much preferable outcome to stimulus money being diverted to the [estimated $8.7 trillion of financial wealth being hidden in tax havens](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2018/01/20/trillions-dollars-have-sloshed-into-offshore-tax-havens-here-how-get-back/2wQAzH5DGRw0mFH0YPqKZJ/story.html) ([which could be closer to $32 trillion when counting non-financial assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth/super-rich-hold-32-trillion-in-offshore-havens-idUSBRE86L03U20120722)).",

They cite all these federal laws on why airlines must be continuously funded and how they can't fail. I just reply, if they are to big to fail, then the airlines industry should be nationalized. \n\nThey don't realize that their fervent support of their future employers getting every support possible is also the reason why they can't pay their $300,000 student loans until they nearly retire.",

But why should they if they get a bailout every single time anyway? But the little shopowner? He should have planned for that and \"some businesses just have to fail because of the market\". Bailouts are interference in the free market. Rather spend that money to help the people of that failing company finding new jobs than trying to keep a corpse alive. Without government support airlines would have failed long time ago or would only work on a smaller level. It also prevented innovation, like alternative means of travelling (highspeed trains).",

The least a government could do, it seems to me, is to divide things up fairly among the babies. There's plenty for everybody in this country, if we'd only *share* more.\n\n\"And just what do you think that would do to incentivize?\"\n\nYou mean fright about not getting enough to eat, about not being able to pay the doctor, about not being able to give your family nice clothes, a safe, cheerful, comfortable place to live, a decent education, and a few good times? You mean shame about not knowing where the Money River is?\n\n\"The *what*?\"\n\nThe Money River, where the wealth of the nation flows. We were born on the banks of it. We can slurp from that mighty river to our hearts' content. And we even take slurping lessons, so we can slurp more efficiently.\n\n\"Slurping lessons?\"\n\nFrom lawyers! From tax consultants! We're born close enough to the river to drown ourselves and the next ten generations in wealth, simply using dippers and buckets. But we still hire the experts to teach us the use of aqueducts, dams, reservoirs, siphons, bucket brigades, and the Archimedes' screw. And our teachers in turn become rich, and their children become buyers of lessons in slurping.\n\n\"It's still possible for an American to make a fortune on his own.\"\n\nSure\u2014provided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there *is* a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and powerful are,' I'd tell him, 'and learn their ways. They can be flattered and they can be scared. Please them enormously or scare them enormously, and one moonless night they will put their fingers to their lips, warning you not to make a sound. And they will lead you through the dark to the widest, deepest river of wealth ever known to man. You'll be shown your place on the riverbank, and handed a bucket all your own. Slurp as much as you want, but try to keep the racket of your slurping down. A poor man might hear.' \"\n\n\\- Kurt Vonnegut ( God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater)",

Ironically, the most political savvy and knowledgeable people I have met have been those who identify as anarchists (not an-cap) and socialists.  Many of these people have been very well read, including well read on conservative and neoliberal literature. But that was probably my bubble and It was skewed toward this sort of person.",

So many of them think they're ruggedly self-sufficient, even as they absolutely *depend* on the robust social safety net for their relatively comfortable lives. And then there's the rampant disinformation. I'm a Toronto native who spends a lot of time (in normal years) in Renfrew County, and some of the locals' misconceptions up there drive me nuts. I think I've managed to change some minds about city slickers like me (\"No, Doug, I don't have fourteen locks on my front door, bars on my windows, or risk death by gangland shooting every time I leave my house. In fact, I've never witnessed a serious crime in my 50+ years of life.\"). But on a lot of other issues, it's a hard slog.\n\nFor instance, a lot of them are dead-set against wind power because they believe the nonsense about the sound of turbines mysteriously causing chronic illness, whereas they're actually a) falling for energy-company propaganda and b) afraid that the pristine outdoor silence they've been so fortunate to enjoy *maybe, possibly, might* be ruined by a slight, faint, occasional sound in the distance. It's delicate snowflake behaviour if I've ever seen it. Meanwhile, not only do most Canadians live with the *constant* hum of city life while hardly ever even noticing it, these country folk suffer more noise pollution from their farm machinery and household electrical appliances than they would from wind turbines.",

I'd much rather they stop responding to the religious right that's been destroying conservatism since the two conservative parties united.

In 6 weeks I paid my stimulus back in taxes. In those same 6 weeks my boss who pays me 5600$ for 8 weeks work roughly, charges 7000$ to put up signs in a city for detours when we have to pave a roadway. He also charges above for material and labor. All in all in the 6 weeks I paid bsck my stimulus through taxes my boss had us do 12 paves,  now to do this sneakily he would have us not work a Monday then work ten a day for the next four. That way we never made any overtime because we technically onl had 40 hours so he could pay us through the ppp program and jot out of his pocket for overtime we should of gotten. So for six weeks we did teo paves a week. He charges 7000 for signs per day so 14000 a week forbsigns alone. Now paving is expensive and we worked out wa h pave probably costs him around 200k in material labor and equipment. While he charges roughly 800k so my boss on a weekly basis made a average of 1 mill in profits. Wasnt having to pay his workers out of pocket. Was illegally not working us to svoid overtime coming out of pocket. The ppp program got used and abused by so many people including a 50 person company from a 50,000 person town in California",

They will only hire people if demand for their product increases and the only way to meet it is to hire more people, or else lose out on potential profits.\n\nThis calculation is constantly being made at every company. \"Does hiring more people increase or decrease the profit margin?\" is the overarching question controlling all hiring in every company. \n\nGiving corporations handouts increases supply. They will just pocket the money. Giving people handouts increases demand. They can now buy things they need/want but previously couldn't. This makes corporations scramble to meet this demand, including hiring more workers to crank out product.",

Today, they ignore the General Theory when it comes to prevention of crisis, and only treat Keyne's legacy as a fiscal firehose, and not a guideline for building a functioning economy.",

No wonder owners are trying to figure out a way to get around it. They were paying nothing, and now have to pay actual salaries.",

Even (or often preferably) at the expense of others. These guys would jump at the chance to turn the US into North Korea so long as you promised them membership in the ruling party. Which, as an aside, probably explains why North Korea is the way it is.",

In this State no person shall be born a slave, after this Constitution is published in the capital of each District, and six months thereafter, neither will the introduction of slaves be permitted under any pretext.\n\nThis led to a few things such as 1) Texan immigrants redefining slavery as debt peonage where slaves would have insurmountable debts that could be repaid but never were and 2) arguing that the six month importation of slavery would be good for the slaves because then their children would be free (this did not happen)",

Oh, and the claim that housing is provided by teams? Yeah, not true as well:\n\nhttps://theathletic.com/4203374/2021/08/04/minor-leaguers-meager-living-conditions-most-stressful-part-of-low-paying-job/\n\n&gt; \"Finding a place to put your head at night is the hardest, most stressful thing to do as a minor leaguer,\" catcher Caleb Joseph, who signed with the Mariners organization in May after he was released by the Mets, told The Athletic's Britt Ghiroli.\n\n&gt; One year in the minors, tired of spending 80 percent of his income on last-minute housing, he lived in his team's clubhouse. Said Joseph: \"Why are we putting guys in a position where they can afford either food or a bed?\"\n\n&gt; The Athletic spoke to more than 30 players from 20 major-league organizations, ranging from undrafted free agents to first-round picks with big-league experience, about their housing travails, past and present.\n\n&gt; Players detailed living out of their cars, dealing with roach-infested apartments and piling multiple teammates in one- or two-bedroom apartments, with some men sleeping on lawn chairs, pool rafts or air mattresses.\n\n&gt; **With rare exceptions, minor-league players \u2014 who are paid only seasonally \u2014 are responsible for procuring and paying for temporary housing for a five-month season. Players get assigned a team, often at the very end of spring training, and get three nights \u2014 in a hotel paid for by the team \u2014 to travel there and figure out where to live.**\n\nThese guys are paid *below* minimum wage DURING THE SEASON ONLY, and then for the other months they're expected to make their own money but also continue to train at the highest possible level in order to come back for another season of being vastly underpaid and overworked while traveling the entire time and spending all of your income on housing and what's left for food.\n\nLastly, it should come as no surprise that this law is designed to hurt consumers (the minor leaguers) and benefit the wealthy (the teams), and all the proof you need of that is right here:\n\n&gt; \"One day after this legislation was filed in Tallahassee, Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of TD Ameritrade whose kids own the Chicago Cubs, gave DeSantis a $1 million donation,\" he added.

There's also just something immensely terrible, no matter what Cain believed in, in using a dead black man's social media to defend the current state of law enforcement.",

Only reason he's on HBO is because Viacom was stupid and didn't get a contract signed before HBO swooped in and made an offer.\n\nWhich is in no way meant to undermine Trevor Noah, who was Stewart's second choice (he went to bat for him, hard) and has been doing a damn fine job in his own right once he found his feet. But Viacom has hamstrung him by making it very difficult for anyone without cable to watch. Trevor's the *only* black late night host at the moment (and the second youngest), so you'd think he might get more attention during the days of the BLM movement.\n\nIn a lot of ways it was really a benefit to all of us that Oliver got picked up by  HBO because he's done significantly more with them than he'd ever have been able to do under Viacom's mismanagement. You can bet his segments wouldn't be nearly as well researched, they'd be broken up by ad breaks, and Viacom would never let them onto YouTube for free every week",

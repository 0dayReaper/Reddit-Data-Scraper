The \"old\" isn't a unified group of people, its the people who were born 60-70+ years ago. Given that the average humna lifespan is about 80 years, you would be hearing about it for a while before it actully happened. While there was a generation of old people dying, it wasn't the Boomers, it was thier parents(Whatever generation that was). As the Boomers were the largest previous generation in terms of population, they were the people you needed to outlive. Given that you heard this 30 years ago when they would have been about 50(2023-30=1993, Boomers being born around 1940 in the aftermath of WWII, 1940+50=1990), the Boomers wouldn't age out of the population for a while. But now that time has passed and their nearing the end of their lifespan they will start aging out. And while, yes their are still people falling for the GOPs lies among GenZ, thats not a large percentage as most of us are smart enough to realize that they don't support us. And don't get me started on the fact that what the GOP tells their voters to do actully shortens their lifespans(not wear masks, not get immunized, sit in front of a TV all day watching propo- uh, I mean news) So suffice to say that it took a while, but their time has come.",

They were literally asking me to picture it happening. I was making a distinction, in a kind way, that \"why, yes, I do remember her doing that, but if we're thinking of the same incident, your recollection may be slightly off, but I can't entirely remember, so maybe, maybe not, and I'll give you (or someone else) a chance to respond and give supplementing or correcting information.\"\n\nSo why do you have to be a bully? Why couldn't you have just said \"yeah, I factually think you're right, and further, my *personal opinion* on the matter, is...\"\n\nThe right really twists the whataboutism argument into extreme territory, but every now and then, if they weren't being so ridiculous, they would have an occasional good argument that \"the left does it too,\" and this thread is one: If you didn't get so offended that I was pointing out a minor *factual discrepancy, supported by video evidence*, to an otherwise good argument, then you wouldn't be responding the way you have. Instead you let hurt feelings drive your decision to downvote (counter to how the Reddit voting system is supposed to work) and attack someone *who wasn't even disagreeing with the larger point*, as you even pointed out!\n\nThat said, I give you credit for speaking up. The others who downvoted are just cowards.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to preemptively assume I have the last word, but if you don't reply, then I still hope you have a good day. Never let some old guy on the internet ruin an otherwise good mood.",

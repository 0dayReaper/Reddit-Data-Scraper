They're stupid, but they don't believe they're stupid and there's no way to prove to them that they're stupid because, by definition, they're too stupid to understand that they're stupid.  They believe that their arguments are clever and well thought out, and if you call them on it, they can fall back to the idea that *you're* the dumb one for not \"understanding\" why they're right.\n\nIf I say I'm stronger than you, it's pretty easy to prove whether that's true or not.  Go find something heavy, and if you pick it up without a problem and I can't, argument over, you're stronger than me.  If I say I'm smarter than you, and it's true, proving that is impossible because they can just say that *any* measuring stick we use is the \"wrong\" one.  The results are always skewed if they don't come out on top.  Education?  They're \"street smart\".  Math?  Irrelevant because you can be great with math and terrible at everything else.  An IQ test?  Nope, because \"everyone knows\" they're fake.  You simply can't win this argument with anyone who's genuinely stupid because they're simply not smart enough to understand when someone else is smarter than them.",

Those secrets cannot be automatically declassified by the president alone and require, by law, extensive consultation with executive branch agencies.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure trump had documents of this nature according to what I\u2019m hearing (allegedly). And I\u2019m also pretty sure that none of those procedures took place. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the best part, \u201cIn all cases, however, a formal procedure is required so governmental agencies know with certainty what has been declassified and decisions memorialized.\u201d\n\nDid any of that happen?

The problem is they all seem to be relying on a notion of \"declassification\" that doesn't exist and is completely impossible. There is no scenario where Trump could have used his presidential powers to give his post-presidency private citizen self permission to retain documents while they remain classified for everyone else. That's not a thing. \n\nIf he declassified them then they're declassified for everyone. The thing nobody seems to mention is that if anything, waving his hands over boxes and boxes of stuff and declaring it declassified would have been far far more egregious and damaging to US national security than taking them home to his bathroom. If he really did that, it would have been the most irresponsible action taken by any president in modern history. Yet somehow that's his *defence*.",

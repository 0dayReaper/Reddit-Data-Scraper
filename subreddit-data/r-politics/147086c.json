As already explained, not only would she have this power, but it would not even be appealable.\n\n&gt;and you think she's safe if she did?\n\nYes, you naive rube. Nothing would happen to her if she exercised her power as a judge.\n\n&gt;You think Feds wouldn't be at her house the next week with a warrant?\n\nA warrant for what? Issuing a clearly biased ruling is not probable cause for any kind of crime. If the ruling isn't appealable, then *by definition* it wouldn't be possible for it to be de facto evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\n&gt;IF she sneezes wrong, she's going to be in prison faster than she can lower the gavel.\n\nSneezing wrong isn't a crime. You really don't seem to know what you're talking about.\n\nNow, the upside in all this is that if she makes biased rulings in the case, the DoJ can and will ask the 11th Circuit to reverse her decisions or force her to recuse. So in a practical sense, it's very likely that she'll either recuse or be forced to recuse before all this is done.\n\n*But*, that's exactly why the Rule 29 motion is so dangerous. If she manages to handle the entire trial with complete fairness, no hint of bias, no reason to force her to recuse, and *then* grants the Rule 29 motion, *there's nothing anyone could do about it*. So the most cunning, crafty Trump ally would do that. We kind of just have to hope that Cannon isn't smart enough to do it that way. To be fair, based on her previous rulings on the search warrant, she's almost certainly not that smart. But the fact remains, if she's still presiding over this case by the time the trial concludes, *you should be very worried*.",

If a president decides to give a speech and announce the locations of our spies, the president is in the clear.\n\nWhat a president cannot do is change the classification on a document without leaving a paper trail.  Even if every bit of information on a document is now public knowledge, that document is still classified until it is marked and dated declassified with a separate paper trail recording the intent to declassify the document.\n\nSo, if the document says classified, it is classified.  Period.\n\nThe reason it is somewhat of an issue in this case is a legal standard called mens rea.  There are laws that require criminal intent.  The word in this particular case would be \"knowingly\" existing in the law.  If we know that Trump knew he could not declassify a document without following the procedure, then he is guilty.  The recording proves he knew.",

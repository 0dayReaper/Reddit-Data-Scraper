I like to bring up when I tried to get politically active back in 2019 in my rural conservative town prior to moving. \n\nOur town had nothing but conservatives in charge for over 40 years. Well before I even was born. I spoke up at a town hall when people were bitching about the town economy going to hell, asking them how they can blame the Democrats when they've had the same politicians and political parties in charge for their entire lives and we had only 2 Democrats on our town board with 11 Republicans. They would blame everything on the 2 Democrats, both officially and by the populace. Taxes went up? It wasn't the 11 Republicans at fault, it was the Democrats. Uptick in local crime, Obama. \n\nI'm pretty sure those people would have burnt me at the stake for speaking up that they were wrong and misguided. One of the board members even doxxed me and I started having MAGA dudes show up at my job  threatening to kill me because I was a trans \"liberal.\"",

It is always that the government is trying to take power from them and screw them over...and that's why they need to elect Republicans to protect them from the evil government!\n\nIt makes no damn sense, but I can tell you as someone who was indoctrinated from birth into conservatism...it works.  It wasn't until I got out of my parents' sphere of influence and started researching things on my own that I figured it out.\n\nBeing heavily computer and internet savvy helped me a great deal to escape that indoctrination.  But most people who are hardline conservative don't become computer geeks.  They follow in their parents' footsteps.  My dad tried to get me to do that and follow him into the oil and gas industry.\n\nIf I had done so, I'd probably still be one of the delusional conservative followers.",

This is a classic case of having your cake and eating it too because government is bad because it is and bad when the infrastructure starts crumbling because an under funded government can\u2019t maintain it.",

It was decades ago at this point, but they were the party that advocated for workers until that platform was abandoned for free trade policy and the slow corporatization and privatization of public institutions. I like to point out according to Fox polls in both 2016 and 2020 Bernie Sanders far outperformed any other democratic candidate among their viewers. Anecdotally, most my family in rural Texas liked Bernie more than Trump in the beginning. They knew Trump was a con artist but voted for him any way to shake things up. If you spend time in these areas it\u2019s pretty obvious to see where the resentment comes from. They pay taxes yet get almost nothing in return in terms of a safety net. Their hospitals, all private now, close due to lack of profitability, their schools can\u2019t afford to keep teachers around, meth is everywhere and there are no serious centers for treatment. The democrats dedicate almost nothing to channel legitimate populist resentment, and because of that, because of greed and cynicism within the upper echelons of the DNC, they\u2019ve handed rural voters over to the republicans, the party with a vivid abject history of ruling class politics, to stoke Christian nationalism, because neither republican or democratic donors have to live in the awful world their policies help create.",

To say we all built this cage is no different than saying an actual bear built the zoo. And before you come at me with \u201cthen just leave,\u201d you have to understand the absolutely jarring difference between rural life and city/suburban life coupled with most people flat out cannot afford to leave. Not to mention, telling someone that their home isn\u2019t worth it and they should just leave is exactly how regions like this become so depressed in the first place. \n\nI know it\u2019s really in vogue to shit all over Appalachians right now since everyone feels the need to other people they don\u2019t agree with, but Appalachians, much like fucking every other subculture in this country, are not a monolith.

I don't know what you mean by \"feels like an age-blind response\". I'm damn near geriatric by Reddit standards if that helps inform your presumptuousness. You've provided plenty of justification for this group of people, who vote against their own self interests and actively vote to harm others, to not like the Democratic Party.  Based on your analysis it's misplaced anger. Okay. I'll accept that. What I do not hear from you is why should the tens of millions of people who make up the Democratic Party change their platform to accommodate this paltry sum of people so ignorant and hate-filled that their rage is supporting and electing the very people who help lash them to poverty and exploit them. Obviously, they are not monolith as no group truly is, but the majority are clearly \"wildly stubborn right-wing douche bags\" while the minority don't fall into the group we are all so happy to denigrate. So what are you trying to accomplish here? You want those seeking progress to let this \"legion of stubborn, poor, uneducated idiots\" kick up their heals on a fainting couch and commiserate? Or should the left just accept that there's a middle between *brown skin people shouldn't exist* and *all people are equal*? Or maybe, we should let them siphon more resources from the big bad cities so they can continue to live in the zoo they maintain (more palatable for you?) while still being provided a voice that far exceeds their numbers and contributions. To those \"painfully accepting leftists who just want everyone to be able to survive\", I say stay the course, because beside you their are Progressives, Democrats, Socialist, and Leftists  pouring sweat and treasure into making this country what it should be. With respect to the people of rural Appalachia who are \"wildly stubborn right-wing douche bags\", they can go fuck themselves and die in their diseased, poverty stricken hovels knowing that they were never truly useless, because they clearly allowed themselves to be used.

In the region there is an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness due to how poorly folks (read: capitalists and the lay public who thinks of us through the lens of J.D. Vance\u2019s brain dead propaganda) treat us from the outside without knowing anything about us. \n\nAppalachia has proportionately a higher rate of lgbtq+ folks than most of the country and an overwhelming amount of gerrymandering/voter suppression that no one pays attention to because it\u2019s again not vogue to give a shit about rural voters. The overwhelming majority of us aren\u2019t hateful conservatives, we are more often than not apathetic, disenfranchised people who want the best for others but frequently don\u2019t have anyone to vote for (look at how money is distributed within the Democratic Party and how often they would rather save money than run a candidate in a race they think is a foregone conclusion). So, while I am a leftist that wants everyone to be able to live, eat, and survive without going into deep poverty, the Democratic Party has abandoned rural voters for my entire life and doesn\u2019t deserve praise for it. \n\nI\u2019d also implore you to consider that you are doing exactly what the Conservative Party wants you to do, in-fight.  There\u2019s a lot of new movement in trying to find people to represent at the local level against the GOP, but it\u2019s hard to start grassroots movements because most of us are dead broke no matter how educated or determined. To follow up on the money support being sent into the region, it  has been working to help progress the region. Hell, I live in a unincorporated town of only about 1000 people and we have fiber optic internet, a growing coding program in our high school, an ecological science program that promotes climate/citizen science, and a handful of community-based organizations that look to help folks find good jobs, feed their families, and teach each others the folk arts/practices, all of which are running on budgets smaller than one average suburbanites\u2019 yearly income. \n\nSo no, most of us aren\u2019t just sucking resources out and voting against our own interests. We\u2019re largely stuck without any representation and then getting shit all over by folks who think we\u2019re all just shoeless hillbillies, rather than a population who has had to try and raise up out of systematic abuse and poverty to make any progress while being robbed of everything we have to offer (tobacco, coal, our lives, etc.)",

I remember, after his retirement he would volunteer religiously at a local prison, sometimes teaching classes in business or different trades, and I remember him talking about how each time he would run into some worker who he knew from Wheeling steel in there it killed him a little bit.\n\nHe always described them as 'steel guys' sitting in there for the next big steel boom that would never come, and lament they were rarely the ones in the classes or even in the yard when he would go just to play chess in there, except when they wanted to ask about whether he had heard anything about the steel mill hiring again, or any new steel company thinking about coming to town. I think it always irked him, all the young guys there would be first in line for any training course, jumping at any chance to better themselves, but these middle-aged, laid off steel workers that he knew had a family back home would be sitting there daydreaming of when it would all just fall right back in place. He would ask them what they would do when they got out, and they would just say that by that point the economy would be good and Wheeling Steel would be hiring like mad, and that Obama fellow, well he would be out of office and the republican would fix it all.",

Maybe local government Republicans care, but at the Federal and state level these fuckers don't give two shits about you. They believe in the economic hierarchy, and you aren't on their level.\n\nThat being said, both Bill Clinton, some corporate Democrats, and an exhaustive list of Republicans helped bring about NAFTA, Chinese manufacturing, WTO, and the end of various Wall Street protections. \n\nHell, our current president is solely responsible for making it near impossible to discharge student loan debt through bankruptcy, and this was during the time that the banks provided the loans.\n\n9 Democrats, and whatever the fuck Kirsten Sinema thinks she is, helped vote down raising the minimum wage. A Democrat killed the public option during Obamacare. \n\nThe Republicans are evil and reprehensible. The people who vote for them are reactionary and, at times, hateful fools. \n\nBut don't think for a second the Democratic party has been perfect because they absolutely have failed this country. We should expect better, but right now everyone here hates the GOP so much they just much on whatever the hell Democrats do.",

Now, there is fresh urgency for the party to try to win them back.  \n\n\nWith Democrats losing their grip on some of the non-White voters who have powered their recent victories, rural residents could prove crucial in the 2024 election cycle. The presidential contest will hinge on results in swing states including Wisconsin, which has a significant rural population. US Senate races in places such as Montana and West Virginia also will help decide control of that chamber.",

This is a much needed reality I feel some liberals need to accept.\n\nYes, Republicans deserve half the blame for the decline of liberal concerns in rural areas, but democrats are also to blame. The problem isnt that there are no winnable voters in rural areas, it is that since Clinton the democrats have struggle (either purposefully or accidentally) to actually speak to rural voters and acknowledge their concerns in a manner that actually appeals to them. \n\nThe primary reason rural voters vote so conservatively isnt because they see any actual benefits from the republican suits, it is because the republican suits will come down to their towns, walk their streets, listen to their problems, and then talk their language. In reality, the fixes republican politicians may make are small, but sometimes that is enough.\n\nFor example, recently my towns state house representative visited my town and discussed a number of issues in a town hall. A couple weeks later, the state DOT came in and installed a guardrail along a stretch of interstate where multiple cars had left the right of way leading to two fatalities, because the representative called up the DOT chief and insisted it needed to be done. There was no fanfare. The (Republican) representative came down. The (republican) representative saw the problem. The (republican) representative fixed it.\n\nSure, it was a tiny, minute little fix that should have been done decades ago. But it wasn't. While the (majority democratic) state government hadn't fixed this problem in decades, it took the Republican a month to get the DOT off their ass to fix this. Why wouldn't the residents support him, even if this is one tiny, nearly insignificant fix? \n\nI'm not saying the democratic state government doesn't care, but it certainly doesnt prioritize their needs, so why should they vote for them? People watch as the big cities - where the majority of the democratic electorate lives - get millions of dollars of investment while their little town needs to get on its knees and beg for a project that would cost a tiny fraction of what the bigger cities get without asking for. And sure, in reality, the state government is prioritizing the larger cities because, proportionally, those repairs and fixes will serve the greater good, however do you really expect people living in the rural town to find solace in that? \n\nI'm a liberal, a democrat, but I can understand why these populations feel like they are ignored and why they feel like they are being talked down to. And that is the crux of the issue. As democrats, we have to find a middle ground where we can actually improve these people's lives - even if they seem minor - on a daily basis. Because nothing motivates an electorate more then if they feel like they are being spurned.",

They knew NAFTA and WTO were going to destroy small town manufacturing jobs, so they needed to chase other voters.\n2. Bill and Hillary assumed all rural voters were as racist and unreasonable as rural Arkansas. That wasn't necessarily true in the Midwest, where Obama did better than either Clinton.\n3. The interests of the major donors corporate Democrats were chasing and the interests of working-class rural voters are directly opposed to each other. Clinton Democrats chose major donors over traditional Democratic voters.",

At this point, they'll take fingerprints, photos, record some other information and bring the defendant before a judge to hear the charges. Then the defendant gets to plead guilty / not guilty (it's almost always the latter unless prosecutors and defendant worked out a plea deal beforehand). Finally, the judge gets to decide whether the defendant has to remain in custody or is released pending trial (with or without bail).\n\nAfter that, the date for the trial has to be set, but before the actual trial begins there is still plenty of time for other matters in complicated and high profile cases. The prosecutors have to send all evidence to the defense attorneys. Both prosecution and defense get the opportunity to file pre-trial motions with the court (for example to exclude certain pieces of evidence).\n\nIt can take months between the defendant turning themselves in the first time and the actual trial starting. It's a long trip.",

We were getting pepper-sprayed in the face by those protesters \u2014 I'm not going to even call them protesters \u2014 by those domestic terrorists,\u201d said the officer.\n\n...\n\n&gt;At the end of the night, after the crowds had been dispersed and Congress got back to the business of certifying president-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory, the veteran officer was overwhelmed with emotion, and broke down in the Rotunda.\n\n&gt;\u201cI sat down with one of my buddies, another Black guy, and tears just started streaming down my face,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018What the fuck, man? Is this America? What the fuck just happened? I\u2019m so sick and tired of this shit.\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt;Soon he was screaming, so that everyone in the Rotunda, including his white colleagues, could hear what he had just gone through.\n\n&gt;\u201cThese are racist-ass terrorists,\u201d he yelled out.\n\n&gt;In the seven years since Black Lives Matter has become a rallying cry, the image of a white cop deciding how and when to enforce law and order has become ubiquitous. On Wednesday, Americans saw something different, as Black officers tried to do the same, as they attempted to protect the very heart of American democracy. And instead of being honored by the supporters of a man who likes to call himself the \u201claw and order\u201d president, Black Capitol officers found themselves under attack.\n\n&gt;\u201cI got called a n***** 15 times today,\u201d the veteran officer shouted in the Rotunda to no one in particular. \u201cTrump did this and we got all of these fucking people in our department that voted for him.

If there's a conviction, those go permanent + the ATF stops by and confiscates all their weapons. If they have any NFA items not registered (automatic weapons, short-barreled rifles, silencers and anything that their state deems illegal unless registered) then add +15 years (each item) on top of their sentence. Get pulled over for a traffic violation and the cop puts a gun in their face as their record is now flagged with \"approach with caution- could be armed and was involved in the terrorist attack on the US Capitol where a police officer was murdered, apprehend and alert the nearest FBI field office\".

I have a feeling that a lot of cops might just call in sick - some of them because they don't want to have to watch their backs against other cops, and others because they don't want to have to go up against the wackos because they either sympathize with them, or want to take part.\n\n2021 is looking like it's going to go to 11.",

He understood that not ALL cops are bad; he'd called on them a time or 2... but he'd also seen some bad shit go down, stuff that was patently unfair, and as a 24 year old white boy even he knew that it was WRONG.  I am about losing my mind with wondering how much worse this can get--- I work with lawyers who prosecute the catholic church against pedophiles... law enforcement strikes me as just as powerful as the Church, and just as hard to infiltrate in order to get information for prosecution.  \"Protect your own\" runs deep and wide.  If Seattle cops traveled all the way to DC to protest, it's because they don't like the way reform is happening here.  Trump said \"it is just beginning\" and I truly believe he has a whole lot more planned.",

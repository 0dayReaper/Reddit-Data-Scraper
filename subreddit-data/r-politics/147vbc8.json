The majority of people seem to understand like you pointed out above just how important it was to have an iron clad case so the right wing propaganda networks couldn't find any wiggle room to de-legitimatize this case.\n\nWhat I don't think many expected and I certainly didn't expect was just how slam dunk of a case this could end up being.  No way in hell I would have ever guessed prosecution would be able to get Trump on mic admitting that he could have declassified the documents he was bragging and showing off but also that he knows he shouldn't be showing them off.  Talk about pure narcissistic ego agreeing to a publisher and writer to let them record you and then whip out some stolen classified documents to brag about.  \n\nReading the indictment it only took me a few pages to put my coffee down and go wow Trump is even more inept and incompetent then I'd imagined.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess then 24 hrs later I saw my neighbor and as a major Trump maga supporter I was curious how this news would have hit him so I just straight up asked What do you think about the indictment do you think Trump is fucked?\n\nAnswer - No this is a good thing.  The indictment means he got rid of those bad lawyers he had and now he's gonna be able to delay while he gets better lawyers until he gets re-elected.  Once he's re-elected  now they charged him he can just pardon himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe just shocked trying to wrap my head around how this fool thinks being indicted is a good thing...  Then trying to digest all the other nonsense without laughing in his face.  It'll be interesting to see how this evolves among other supporters and if they can as quickly mentally paint this as a good thing like he did or if its going to make maga idiots really confront the fact Trump is just a straight up conman and criminal.",

Every once in awhile you'll catch commentators early on having the light bulb flicker and to me that is just down right fun to watch.

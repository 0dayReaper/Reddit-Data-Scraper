These types of articles miss the point and really underplay progress many industries have made. \n\nAmong millennials the gender pay gap is much smaller (and even nonexistent in some industries) and doesn\u2019t really increase until women start having kids. In some industries like IT I have heard that women tend to be offered higher entry level salaries because the gender balance is so off.\n\nAlso, one thing that doesn\u2019t ever get reflected in this type of data is that men do over 90% of the work that\u2019s considered hazardous which usually pays more.\n\nMy problem with this article is that it\u2019s generalizing to create click bait outrage. Pay parity is meant to be between jobs not across them. We still have a lot of work to achieve that goal and we should. However, I feel like these types of articles grab the number that sounds the most outrageous and use that to generate anger and clickbait.\n\nWe definitely need more pay transparency and help for working mothers. I think that would probably help the most.",

Women started their careers when the wage gap was much more pronounced. The target year of 2054 is right when the last of the millennial generation start hitting retirement age.\n\nThere is one factor that is a major problem. Women\u2019s earnings take a hit when they have kids. We need to focus on programs that help working mothers to prevent this. \n\nAlso, the wage gap does vary by industry and when a person entered the work force. That\u2019s why some of these stats are misleading.\n\nIt\u2019s still a problem and one that should continue to try to address, but it\u2019s not monolithic.",

If either of those conditions are true, women would have less time to devote to work due to increased family obligations. The other biological factor that no doubt accounts for some disparity is that women get pregnant, give birth, and nurse infants.

However, that gap is still larger for women of color, as the group reported that full-time working Latina and Black women make 57 and 67 cents for every dollar their White male counterparts bring in.  \nVarious factors contribute to the wage gap, from unconscious biases about mothers in the workplace to an overrepresentation of women in lower-paying jobs like teaching, and the fact that the wage gap tends to increase for women as they age, per Census data.",

They create Boogeymen with stuff like \"crisis at the border\" or \"the attack on Christmas\".  Non-existent  issues that help solidify the base.  \n\nThe big issue with creating this myth that there is a pay gap is that is directly (or indirectly) makes men the \"bad guy\" in this.  When more men already identify as Republican, and that gap is even bigger for white men, why the fuck would you want to make them look like the \"bad guy\" and make them want to vote for the GOP even more???

The often referenced large numbers are from studies that do not control for relevant wage determinants.\n\nConsider two groups, A and B. Group A is more likely to have graduated high school than group B. There is an earnings premium for completing high school. If you do a comparison of means, it would show a higher wage for group A. Misrepresenting this result would say the difference in wages is due to group membership.\n\nA proper study design would include covariates and control for the differences between groups that impact wages. If this was accounted for and there was no wage gap across groups, then nothing could be attributed to group membership. One of the top labor economists has a lot of work on the gender wage gap. She mostly shows that it doesn't exist in gender alone.\n\nThere is a fascinating body of literature exploring some of the non-wage employment preferences that differ across men and women. Coupled women are often willing to take a pay cut to be closer geographically to their children. Single parents (80% are women) are more likely to have preferences for jobs with certain features like flexible hours and take a pay cut because this is worth a compensating dollar value to them.\n\nDespite a lot of these wage gaps being shown to not be that large, there are still some compelling studies showing discrimination in the hiring process. I am not aware of any that use male and females as a comparison, but there are two well-done studies that show discrimination in the interview process by race.",

It\u2019s like those bar charts where they show how much higher one is than the other, then it turns out they zoomed into the very top and it\u2019s like 100,000 vs 100,020.\n\nThere are a lot of grueling jobs out there that require physical labor, discomfort, and danger. While I\u2019m sure there are some women in those jobs, it\u2019s roles primarily filled by men. The pay reflects that.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard it said that women can be set back by having children. Not in a malicious way, but if you take two people hired at the same time, and one decided to take several months to a few years off to be with their children, it\u2019s naturally going to put them behind the person who didn\u2019t. Whether they\u2019re a man or a woman.\n\nHaving said that, all things being equal, I\u2019m 100% against paying someone less for the same skill and work. That\u2019s just stupid. Incentivizing your employees leads to better work, better work leads to more work and money for the company, more work for the company means more money for raises and bonuses. It benefits everyone. Underpaying an employee for a stupid reason leads to resentment not only from them, but from others who could see themselves in the same situation and you\u2019ll get worse work from them.",

Some examples :\n\n- Women  are funneled into lower paying jobs.\n\n- When women manage to increase their representation in a job title, like if a job becomes over half women, it starts to be seen as \"women's work\" and compensation falls of a cliff.\n\n- Women are expected to shoulder the burdens of parenting. They are less able to put in all the \"face time\" required in many instigators to really climb the corporate ladder. \n\n- Women are expected to take off years from their careers to raise children.\n\n- Equally  qualified women are seen as less qualified than make peers. Orchestras were 90% male and had a hard time finding \"qualified\" female musicians... Until they started having blind auditions, and now triangle is about even. Even then, it was  found that just hearing the click of high heels walking to the audition chair was enough to bias the listener against the performer.\n\n- Equality  on paper isn't equality in practice. Companies will have two job titles for virtually identical jobs. One title will be mostly women - let's call it \"secretary\" - and one will be mostly men - let's  call it \"clerk.\" The secretary position will pay much less than the clerk position. The clerk position is also seen as the stepping stone to promotions and management, while the secretary position is dead end. This is one of the reasons why looking at compensation *within* a title doesn't always show major  discrepancy. It's also a reason why unions are awesome, because in a union job, titles with similar duties make similar pay. AND it's also a reason women gravitate towards jobs in local, state, and federal government - those  jobs are still largely unionized and they are much more likely to follow anti discrimination law.\n\n- There's more and maybe I will link later. There's a a nonprofit that compiles info on the wage gap into a report every year.",

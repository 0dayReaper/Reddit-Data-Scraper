They would twist their perspective in order to rationalize what they saw.  It doesn't matter if their perspective isn't based in reality, because they will still have their leader.

They have more than they need but they want more\". \n\nI know it's not a big deal, he probably forgot as soon as the interaction was over, but he sighed and said, \"yeah, you're right.\"\n\nI wanted to ask him how immigration had anything to do with how drug companies make money but I think/hope I got through and challenged the propaganda without tripping his defenses.",

But mostly he's an asshole, which is all what a lot of republican officials used to want to be.  Pretend to be famous, make money under the table, use their power mainly when it benefits themselves.  Now, they have international corporate/underground/black market/blood money influence because they got themselves in too deep, many willfully.\n\nA guy like Ted Cruz would have every right to back Christie up, but Christie doesn't care one way or the other if anybody got behind him.  He'll be given the opportunity to say all he wants as long as he's running, and still he'll get on shows until the election is over, because the election cycle pretty much never ends now, with all the right-wing sycophants turning political commentary into a new religion.\n\nHe won't gain the momentum to win, but he could get other nominees to stop babying the situation if either of them is actually serious about the nomination, otherwise, what is the point? They are all scared of Trump's base, so their campaigns will be ineffective.\n\nAt least Christie is leaving open the door to get on the other side of the Trump era, but few will walk through.

Seriously, I would love to see Biden crush those two choads in a bike race.  Hell, I'd like to see Christie or Trump even ride a bike ten feet.  I doubt either of them could balance on a bicycle.  Meanwhile, Biden cycles daily, and the media STILL repeats the lies that he's somehow too old.\n\nRe Christie's lie about the economy... Trump is the only president to ever have NEGATIVE job creation over his term.  When he left office, our economy was dead,  people were locked at home.  The trump admin had just spent three months totally bungling vaccine rollout, which isn't surprising given that trump himself nearly died of covid, was vaccinated and boosted up to his eyeballs, yet publicly he was pretending he didn't believe in vaccines, or even covid.\n\nBiden inherited an economy shit show of epic proportions, and his team has done a masterful turnaround.\n\nBut thanks to false repetition, Biden is somehow branded as having a \"bad\" economy.  Why?  Because avian flu made eggs expensive for a few weeks?  Because gas prices are \"only\" 20% less now than they were during trump's incompetent tariff laden economic sabotage?",

They did something like 18 different student loan programs worth billions, nary a brag.  Lowest unemployment in 70 years, but all you hear is Biden agreeing that \"times are tough\".  WTH?  \n\nAnd even though I hate the appeasement that's happened with Russia, it's been a strategy that would be wildly popular with voters if his admin would just get out there and brag it up.\n\nThen you have the utter sidelining of former prosecutorial bulldog Kamala Harris.  She could have been used to launch daily negative attacks on all the evil GOP creeps like Desantis and others.  It's what she's good at.  It's all she's good at.

She could have served her country well by taking that role.\n\nInstead, she's at 2.5 years of silence and uselessness.

I think Biden won the electoral college by some 200K votes in the right places in the battleground states in 2020. 200K is not a lot (I want to emphasize that it's the electoral college that counts, because there are so many posters that cite the popular vote, but the popular vote does not determine who wins the presidency).  This means if Trump had lucked out again in 2020 like he did in 2016, and Trump had gotten 200K votes in the right places, he would have gotten a second term.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won by some 10K votes, in the right places in the battleground states, against Hillary. 10K votes is not a lot. And Trump did luck out in 2016 in that he got the right votes in the right battleground states.  If someone like Chris Christie can affect the margins for Republican voters, it can have a huge outcome in the 2024 presidential election.",

The only thing to do is give police more power to control people with mental health issues. Because all the shooters that had mental health issues were well known before they became shooters. \n\nLike the LV shooter, who had no history of mental health problems and no arrests. Not everyone who has a mental health problems gets reported or even treated. So when a background check is done, there is nothing to suggest that there is a problem. And even if an individual does get reported, they can still get guns. By private sales or through relatives with clean background checks.",

The goal should be to help them plug a major gap by increasing utilization and covering fixed costs.  The goal should not be to inject profits back into an ailing sector.",

NYC is giving these people free hotels and meals but there are far too many people living on the street or staying in homeless shelters. Food insecurity is rampant in certain communities of NYC. If you don\u2019t see how that\u2019s not a proper allocation of funding then idk what\u2019s else to say.\n\nNo other country has immigration policies like the US. This shit wouldn\u2019t fly anywhere else in the world yet we have the least amount of social programs amongst other top tier countries yet we allow people to freely seek asylum and give them everything the poor here don\u2019t get.",

The suggestion that people in NYC are Democrats therefore TX is targeting Democrats weaponizing partisanship in a deeply unpatriotic way. \n\nTX is sending migrants to NYC because the city doesn't have the federal funding or facilities in place. It is absolutely disgusting what TX is doing.",

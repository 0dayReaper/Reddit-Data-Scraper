He just signed a bill purported to be about digital rights, but one provision makes it illegal to use people\u2019s social media posts in consideration for jobs, loans, or housing.  It also says search history, though not sure how people come upon that without a subpoena or being Google themselves.  How will they know an employer considered it or even saw it is not clear either.  This tells me that the plan is to allow any hothead public posting conservative to claim social media based discrimination for any denials.  I guess then the hiring managers search history and emails have to be turned over for discovery?  It all adds up to fuckery designed to protect them as they say more and more violent things designed to incite.",

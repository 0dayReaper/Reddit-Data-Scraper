            "comment": "Affirmative action is not the path to an equitable society because it happens too late and too narrowly in people\u2019s lives. \n\nThe path is publicly funded child care, excellent schools absolutely everywhere in the US, starting with the poorest counties, universal healthcare with top medical care available to our poorest citizens and other social programs that help entire communities. Lastly, individuals and families are far more than just a race. To help people, we need to look at people in a more nuanced way. Bring people together, not divide them by race. \n\nI am not opposed to affirmative action as a sort of \u201cbandage\u201d but only as a temporary solution. As a long term solution, affirmative action increases racism (it had been tried all over the world with poor results), and distracts from better solutions. \n\nAll that said, I do not trust the Supreme Court\u2019s motives and I seriously doubt they are look for better solutions!",

Despite being endorsed by every major Democrat politician in/from California, every major sports team in California, every university in California, almost every major company in California, the ACLU, etc.; all of whom spent an enormous amount of money in support of the proposition, outspending the opposition by a factor of 19 to 1.  That's why the article is saying its shocking and a wakeup call for Democrats.  Despite all of that support, despite all of that money, the proposition was overwhelmingly defeated by a near supermajority: IE: affirmative action is pretty unpopular.",

Why didn't they open with what the issue is and what this proposition intended to alleviate? After reading the Wiki page, something happened with the Yes campaign that drove voters to oppose it where polling prior to the vote showed an even split.",

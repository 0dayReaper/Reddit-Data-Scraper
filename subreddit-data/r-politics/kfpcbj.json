My sister and brother in law have for years been very pro-democrat, pro left social policies, etc, etc. My sister in particular hates trump, she took pride that she was a college educated woman with a good job and the intelligence enough to see him for the con he is. Last year she got a new job as very high up executive in a huge commercial shipping company. \n\nShe now has daily meetings with her boss that owns the company, one of America\u2019s billionaires, and his cronies are her coworkers. Over the past year and a half I have watched her turn into one of -them- due to their brain washing. Now everything is about how the democrats have screwed America with trade deals dating backing to the first Clinton administration and China is the end of us, the virus is being thrown way out of proportion, she shouldn\u2019t have to wear a mask, and it\u2019s like a 2 am reply of Fox News headlines.

I was really proud of that. That was 13 years ago and as it turns out, after all the promotions and raises I received, that place paid me more than I\u2019ve ever been paid. I left it once for school but was back and in charge for 3 years. I left it because I had a child on the way and the 60 hour work weeks meant I would have to be the same sort of father my father was. I didn\u2019t want that. So I took all my experience and moved into the cannabis industry, where I made one dude millions and was paid 30k to do so while holding 3 titles (Director of Purchasing, Director of Wholesale Operations &amp; District Manager) &amp; was working more than 60 hours regularly. I just left that job with nowhere to really go other than stay in the industry. I\u2019m really tired of playing this game.",

In the absence of a quorum, the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions. As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency's enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action.\n\nBut then the GOP Senate approved three new FEC members! Broussard, a Democrat, and two Republicans literally a week and a half ago.\n\n&gt; Broussard, the incoming commissioner with FEC experience, said during a Senate Rules Committee meeting last month she would prioritize addressing important cases that are set to expire due to the agency\u2019s statute of limitations. The FEC\u2019s most recent enforcement report found that 115 cases will expire soon.\n\nBut wait...\n\n&gt; Issue One, a cross-partisan organization that advocates for stronger campaign finance laws, voiced concerns about the Republican FEC nominees. Dickerson has consistently opposed laws attempting to reveal donors to dark money groups and has argued against contribution limits in court.\n\n&gt; Earlier this year, the Senate confirmed another frequent defender of dark money, Republican election lawyer Trey Trainor, to the FEC. As chair of the commission \u2014 the position rotates each year \u2014 Trainor recently made baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, echoing Trump.\n\nSo basically, a lame-duck president was able to push through 3 Republican FEC commissioners, all three of whom are against against enforcing election laws, believe there should be no limits on contributions, and that people should be able to give money in secret with no government oversight.",

All to drop off a laptop for repair, coincidentally at a huge MAGA fan shop. \ud83d\ude09 he decided to never pick up his own laptop. \ud83d\ude09\nThere\u2019s security footage of it, but it got lost. Epstein style. \ud83d\ude09 But don\u2019t worry- the MAGA man swears he saw him drop it off. Turns out he has a mental condition where he CANNOT RECOGNIZE FACES (I\u2019m not joking) he knew it was hunters though, cause of the stickers on the laptop... \ud83d\ude09 MAGA man, naturally, didn\u2019t just erase and resell the laptop, but did the totally normal thing of duplicating the hard drive and spending hours sorting through thousands of emails to find one that suggests Hunter might\u2019ve tried to arrange a meeting with daddy Biden \ud83d\ude09 no evidence any meeting ever occurred, but who cares.\nIn comes Rudy Giuliani, cyber security expert, and talking set of teeth -who was tricked by Borat, and periodically butt dials reporters on accident -he has \u2018confirmed\u2019 the info not even the FBI could. \ud83d\ude09 Rudy was so worried about the intel, he sat on the laptop for months until 3 weeks before the election. \ud83d\ude09\nNaturally, it proves Hunter was into pedo devil sex too, but the proof is secret and for Rudy\u2019s eyes only. \ud83d\ude09 there\u2019s a video of said drug fueled sexcapades, but again, you just gotta trust rudy \ud83d\ude09\nRudy refuses to send any electronic proof of the emails to anyone. But it\u2019s definitely real, and definitely exists \ud83d\ude09 Heh. Again- not a single news agency has actually seen any proof, except for photos of printed emails. This is why ThEY WoNT CoVeR iT\nHe was \u2018confirming\u2019 it the same time Trump received an intel briefing that Rudy was unknowingly being used by Russian operatives to spread disinformation. Lmao.\nRudy, tired of getting made fun of, tweets some more \u2018source material\u2019 text messages... except the text is in an app that didn\u2019t exist at the time it supposedly happened, and...literally in Russia. Poor guy.\nThis was all also investigated by a real Post reporter who refused to put their name on it, as no part of it could be verified. Several news outlets also passed on the story for the same reason, including FoxNews and WSJ. Ended up written by Sean Hannity\u2019s producer. Lol.\nNow comes a guy named Bobulinski - alleging he, uhh met with Biden to discuss a Chinese business deal\ud83d\ude09. He has proof, of course: \u2018documents\u2019 he says \ud83d\ude09 naturally, he actually hasn\u2019t released anything.\nThe WSJ opinion section finally publishes a Bobulinkski piece. Note: opinion section, not news, as they still couldn\u2019t verify anything. It alleges the above Chinese deal. They very next day, the WSJ news section refutes the entire thing, using Bobulinksi\u2019s own source material. \ud83d\ude06\nHere comes Tucker Carlson. He is about to release a bombshell. All the emails. Proving everything. Unfortunately, these apparently only existed as single physical copies. The emails. Electronic mails. Only existed as one physical copy. (Got that?). Sadly, these printed non-electronic emails were lost (stolen!) in the mail, and no one ever made a copy \ud83d\ude09, so we may never know which dog ate Tucker\u2019s homework or who made-up this made-up story.\nNext up is Martin Aspen, Swiss intelligence operative. He is the basis for many of these allegations and brought it public in a dossier that the PRESIDENT received.. it turns out he is not real. Literally, they made his face on a face generator and gave him a cute linkedIn profile at a fake company. Probably just a cover for the deep state. \ud83d\ude09\nI think I\u2019ve got it all, but hard to say as they keep making new stuff up.",

Without a common enemy you guys focused on each other, revealing the underlying turmoil that was present since the Civil War. Good luck fixing this shit. I sincerely mean that.",

It had a big conservative wing for most of its existence because it was the conservative party, and even after realignment it retained a substantial conservative wing but they mostly died off in 2010. Nowadays it is basically dead - the closest to \"conservatives\" that you can now find are folks like Manchin and Sinema who are basically just moderates with a very slight liberal lean rather than anything conservative",

You have the trump concentration camps at the border. Then there was that whole debacle about Muslims not being allowed into the country. \n\nThere are quite a few examples when it comes to racism. But it's not always about policy but what they also say to rile up their base. And throughout history we also have the conservatives pushing for slavery, Jim Crow laws. \n\nEven now they keep going \"mah heritage\" with the confederate flag which is a terroristic enemy flag that stood for oppressing people of color. \n\nGranted most conservatives will happily accept a anyone to join them so they can use them as a \"look see we accept\" meanwhile they will continuely spew hatred towards them and try to write up laws against them.

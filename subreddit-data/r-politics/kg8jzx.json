If Senators and members of Congress started getting kicked out, prosecuted, and sent to jail, it would probably achieve the same effect... to me this law is sort of like a bandaid for the real problem, which is that Congress won\u2019t police its own. I don\u2019t blame Warren because she probably knows she can\u2019t change the underlying culture, so it\u2019s probably at least slightly more realistic.",

An ex-senator without clout or influence is about as useful for lobbying as a one-season 2nd stringer quarterback who never played a down in the NFL is for PR purposes: zilch.",

The only reason most people want in those roles is for power or for legacy.\n\nAt the same time, our laws put the burden of proving wrongdoing on people who will never have access to the evidence they'd need to slamdunk a conviction -- and even then, there's no incentive for an agency to pursue it. \n\nIf you run games, there's the idea, \"Never trust the player.\"  If they *can* break it, they *will* break it - so don't even make the option available.

Congress gets great benefits but their health insurance, retirement, and death benefits are the same as all other civilian federal employees.\n\n&gt;While members of Congress are required to purchase insurance via an Affordable Care Act exchange, they receive a federal subsidy amounting to 72% of their premiums, per Snopes. (Democrats say it's a stand-in for the employer contribution most workers get.) They're also potentially eligible for lifetime health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program upon retirement.\n\nThis isn't a Democrats say thing.  Per the OPM website: \"For most employees and annuitants, the Government contribution equals the lesser of: (1) 72 percent of amounts OPM determines are the program-wide weighted average of premiums in effect each year, for Self Only, Self Plus One and Self and Family enrollments, respectively, or (2) 75 percent of the total premium for the particular plan an enrollee selects.\"  This is the contribution that ALL federal employees get.\n\n&gt;Depending on age and length of service, members can receive a lifelong pension of 80% \u2014 which, given today's congressional salary of $174,000, equals out to $139,200 in annual taxpayer-funded retirement benefits, per Investopedia.\n\nAgain this is technically the same as a civilian employed with the federal government but 80% is taking an extreme edge case.  Federal employees are in one of 2 pension plans depending on when they started and very very few people are under the older CSRS plan because employees that started after Jan 1, 1987 are in the FERS pension plan.  Under CSRS you don't pay into or collect social security to the pension payout is higher, under FERS you pay into and collect social security so the pension payout is lower.  These pension plans both pay out higher the more years you work.  Under FERS you get 1% of your salary per year worked if you work under 30 years and 1.1% per year worked if you work over 30 years.  So a Senator that serves 6 years and started after 1987 gets a 6% pension once they reach retirement age, not 80% for life.  To get 80% under FERS you would need to serve 73 years in Congress which is pretty impossible currently.  Under the CSRS system that hardly anyone will be retiring under you get 1.5% for the first 5 years, 1.75% for the second 5 years, and 2% of the rest.  So as an example if Mitch McConnel retired at the end of his next term after serving from 1984 to 2026 or 42 years his pension would be 80.25% of his salary for the rest of his life, but he would not collect social security.  Also these pensions do not kick in the day you quit working, they kick in when you reach retirement age (60-62 for most people) with the option to take early retirement at age 57 for a reduced benefit payout.\n\n&gt;Upon the death of a member of Congress in office, their family will receive a payout equal to a year's salary ($174,000), per Congressional Institute. The one-time death gratuity for families of military personnel killed in action is $100,000.\n\nYeah, all civilian federal employees get a free 1x their base salary in life insurance.  Not sure exactly why the military is different, maybe it has something to do with the fact that so much of their salary is not base pay but is things like housing allowances and combat pay which would not be factored into the life insurance formula.  \n\nCongress gets a lot of perks but their traditional benefits (the kind that regular employees get) match what all federally employed civilians get which is fair.  I agree that private sector employees often get shafted on benefits and we should work to improve that.  I am not trying to disagree with your points just put some of the data in context.",

An exception would be if they knew that there would be a major market downturn.  They could move all their assets into the G fund before the drop, and then back to the C, S and I at the bottom of the market to capitalize on the growth.\n\nThere are also blind trusts they can go into.  Or they can give their financial advisor the power to make all trades on their behalf.  The problem here is they could simply select an advisor who was willing to play ball.  Any advisor would love to have a politician client and would certainly be tempted to break the rules.",

His views on women, and black women especially, are also fucking atrocious. he's pretty radical in all his views it seems.\n\nMy impression was that he cares about racism but thinks it as natural and feels more comfortable with out-and-out racists than liberal whites who mask it. Like him working for Regan and saying something like \"you know what you're getting into\". I think he's right that a lot of white liberals have a lot of racist views. But I think he's wrong that it can't change. My theory is the white liberals he's been around where mostly elite which aren't really representative. \n\nAnd i think your right that he feels like he can carve out his own sphere of influence. But, again my impression, was that he sees things as more of a class affinity of his powerful peers while still being essentially in different worlds divided by race. Like his peers are also little lords of their own fiefdoms so they have that in common but the fief's will always be separated.\n\nI don't know Uncle Ruckus as a character, but i'll take your word for it!",

            "comment": "As for Biden:\n\n&gt;The Biden administration has already pursued efforts to address drug prices, including policies contained in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act that capped annual Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000, barred companies from charging seniors more than $35 a month for insulin and imposed new penalties on drug companies that raised prices faster than the rate of inflation. The legislative package also allowed Medicare to negotiate the prices of some drugs. The pharmaceutical giant Merck this month sued the Biden administration over the drug-price negotiation policy, arguing it was a form of \u201cextortion\u201d that would discourage research and development.\n\n&gt;Biden in October 2022 issued an executive order calling on his administration to develop additional policies to combat high drug prices, such as using new government payment models through an innovation center at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n&gt;Health officials in February released a report on their initial progress developing those models. \u201cAs President Biden has made clear, we must build on the new prescription drug law with further action,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement at the time.\n\n&gt;Biden officials have promised to do more to combat the issue.\n\nAs for Sanders:\n\n&gt;The Vermont senator has met with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Becerra, urging them to take broader actions on drug pricing, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations. Asked about when he would move forward with health nominees, Sanders said there first needed to be a \u201cpublic discussion\u201d about a government-wide plan to lower drug prices, and he would not accept private reassurances from senior officials that they are working on it.\n\n&gt;Sanders said he was not worried that delaying the NIH nominee and other potential nominees would harm the health department\u2019s operations, adding that Lawrence A. Tabak, the acting NIH director, was \u201cdoing a good job\u201d and that he would support the NIH as some Republicans debate whether to limit its funding.",

That it can't possibly be Sanders using his position to fight for the best possible outcome for seniors and therefore all of us as we age into the system?\n\nIts fine that the Biden has made some progress but promises to get something done at a later point when Sanders has something they want now is called politics and in this particular case, if Sanders caved, the WH would have no reason to pursue anything more than they've done because they'll have gotten what they wanted. \n\nThe Biden WH could 100% do what he's asking *right now* but they aren't so Sanders said \"Enough\".  \n\nAgain, the Biden effort may or may not yield results. Sanders effort 100% will and Biden gets a new NIH Director. That they're trying to kick the can down the road shows how much they are interested in actually doing anything.\n\nBut its just Sanders asking for pie in the sky, right?",

He was 100 percent correct. Look at how ineffective his EO is because an EO is subject to attack from so many diffrent vectors. Even if he is reelected people may not see any relief because it will still be in the courts most likely.\n\nBiden may be old but he understands as well as anyone the proper way to craft lasting legislation. I wish Sanders would take a few notes because I think he could be getting some things moving he just doesn't seem to want to get his hands dirty",

Ted kennedy died and then joe lieberman withheld his vote unless it was removed from the senate bill.  Because the senate would not pass anything more, the house had no choice but to pass the crippled version or pass nothing.  Dems did use reconciliation in the senate to pass a limited bill fixing what they could under reconciliation rules.\n\nIt is laughable to claim bernie has no plan.  Dems never had enough of a majority to pass any healthcare bill since obama care.\n\nEverything that you hate about insurance and healthcare should have been fixed 14 years ago.  But 59 votes wasn't enough of a majority because of the stupid filibuster rule.\n\nBernie cannot get anything passed via congress, but biden can certainly do some things via the executive branch and bernie would be a hypocrite if he did not push biden hard to do what can be done.",

As such, it combines a high level of private ownership of capital and the means of production with relatively onerous regulation and taxation. \n\n&gt;Third, to the extent that what anti-capitalist Sanders supporters really want is a Scandinavian-style social democracy, with its high level of wealth redistribution and income equality, they should consider that even some of the most socially democratic countries on earth are, in one crucial way, more capitalist than the United States.\n\nBernie Sanders is not a socialist, but a social democrat.  Nor does the United States act in a fully unregulated, libertarian dream of unfettered Capitalism.",

Senators, especially Democratic Senators care about helping people and would be willing to work on this issue.  If he actually tried and worked with people Sanders could get things done.  Instead, he's obstructing the work of the National Institute of Health on an unrelated issue to falsely attack the Biden administration.  If Cruz or Manchin did something like this, people would rightfully call them out on it.",

It only became known after the election was over. No circus or grandstanding or timed releases or whataboutism or outrage.",

The right went apeshit over \"the big guy\" being mentioned in an email. It seemed sketchy then, and it's even sketchier now that it has been used _twice_ by the GOP and their fraudulent claims. In reality, no one is running around calling Biden \"the big guy.\"\n\nThey wanted to bring all this out at once to manufacture a scandal in 2020 but the laptop fizzled and Barr didn't do the assist that they expected him to do.\n\nSure, I have no evidence of a conspiracy, but neither does the Washington Examiner.",

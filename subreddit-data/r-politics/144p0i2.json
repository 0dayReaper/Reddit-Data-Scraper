Offer up some access to the calendar, maybe compromise on some bills, you know govern, He'd need only a few Republicans to support him and this house would not only become productive but bipartisan. The rightwing pundits would hate it and the dipshit caucus but history would look favorably on this accomplishment in the current political arena. He has a couple of options for his legacy, a toothless leader who is wrangled by some of the dumbest members of the house, or an effective coalition builder who defied the odds, bucked the party, and served the country. He'll cave to the dipshit caucus but it was a nice thought.",

I saw someone commenting that he hugged W like he was supporting a war criminal or basically what Ellen was accused of, but that's not really the kind of thing Garth does. He just hugged one first lady, then decided the hell with it and hugged the rest in the row (looks like Bill even encouraged him to). That's all the thought that went into it.\n\nHe's basically that really folksy, happy-go-lucky uncle type. The sort of people the south often pretends to be until a black person enters the room. Garth, though, is fairly genuine. \n\nIf the message of the inauguration was unity, there's really no better country star to represent that. He's an aggressively sincere guy that has [long believed passionately in tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Shall_Be_Free?wprov=sfla1).   Unity and love are strong themes in a lot of his music. He's perhaps the last legend of sincere country music from before 9/11, after which the genre was hijacked by the faux-patriots and bro-country douchebags that [turned it into a pandering machine.](https://youtu.be/y7im5LT09a0)",

From the election taking forever, to my worrying about faithless electors, to the goddamn stop the steal bullshit, to 1/6 raising my hopes with the Georgia runoffs before dashing them entirely with the insurrection, to me worrying about the state of everything and wondering if all those people would go free or if there'd be even more bullshit.  It felt like a living nightmare.  The only plus is that I basically learned everything about how our government and electoral process worked and frankly a part of me wishes I never knew some of this shit so I wouldn't have to think about how functionally stupid it is.  But hey, we're here.  We made it.  \n  \nAnd most importantly, I hope someone does something about the lame duck period.  There is no reason it needs to be that long, jesus",

This is the beginning of a new process in American history, one that has not been seen since the Civil War and in ways that extend beyond it. It was clearly highlighted by President Biden that he wants to unify those that stand against him and that\u2019s what we need, but not without consequences. Our nation and democracy was attacked not only at the capital, but continuously over four years. It has weakened us beyond current understanding.\n\nThe depth of the damage that the Trump Administration has had on our government and country will not be fully realized for some time. There are so many avenues for risk assessment that the Biden Administration will have to take. Trump and his administration are the greatest intelligence threats this country has ever faced. \n\nDomestically our court systems have been filled with conservative judges that will assert irreproachable damage upon the rights of our people. Mitch McConnell gained everything he wanted, fill the district, circuit and Supreme Courts with conservative justices. We have seen a rise and emboldenment of white nationalism that has not been seen since the 1960s, we must stomp it out at all costs and go beyond the precedents of the past as they have failed. \n\nInternationally longstanding relationships, treaties and goals of America have been abandoned by the Trump administration further strengthening our enemies and weakening our diplomatic relations with others. There has never been a greater test to American legitimacy then the Trump administration. \n\nThis marks a very important chapter in the story that is America, I hope the Biden Administration can right the ship. We need to be beyond wary of the continuous attacks on our democracy by enemies both foreign and domestic (GOP) and we need to strengthen the foundations of our democracy with resolute speed. This is not the end of the war against our republic, this is just one step in the battle towards correcting our nation. We must continue to fight, we must continue to build a better future, not for ourselves but those who come after us. \n\n*A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.* \n\n-\tAnonymous Green Proverb",

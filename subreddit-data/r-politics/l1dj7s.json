I saw someone commenting that he hugged W like he was supporting a war criminal or basically what Ellen was accused of, but that's not really the kind of thing Garth does. He just hugged one first lady, then decided the hell with it and hugged the rest in the row (looks like Bill even encouraged him to). That's all the thought that went into it.\n\nHe's basically that really folksy, happy-go-lucky uncle type. The sort of people the south often pretends to be until a black person enters the room. Garth, though, is fairly genuine. \n\nIf the message of the inauguration was unity, there's really no better country star to represent that. He's an aggressively sincere guy that has [long believed passionately in tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Shall_Be_Free?wprov=sfla1).   Unity and love are strong themes in a lot of his music. He's perhaps the last legend of sincere country music from before 9/11, after which the genre was hijacked by the faux-patriots and bro-country douchebags that [turned it into a pandering machine.](https://youtu.be/y7im5LT09a0)",

After Biden's prayer and speech for the lost and then fuckin' Garth Brooks started singing Amazing Grace, I couldn't. I closed my office doors and wept.\n\nIt's been a hard year. I sincerely hope we see some good over the next few.\n\nEdit: I'm usually not big on edits, but I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for the outpouring of love and support. The sympathy and kindness that has filled my inbox has brought a genuine smile to my face. The loss over this past year for so many of us is hard to carry...but I really believe that the simple acts of kindness like I'm looking at here will help make that burden easier to carry as we all move on. \n\nIf my mom were still with us, she would hug all of you. Every single one. And then probably feed you.",

This is the beginning of a new process in American history, one that has not been seen since the Civil War and in ways that extend beyond it. It was clearly highlighted by President Biden that he wants to unify those that stand against him and that\u2019s what we need, but not without consequences. Our nation and democracy was attacked not only at the capital, but continuously over four years. It has weakened us beyond current understanding.\n\nThe depth of the damage that the Trump Administration has had on our government and country will not be fully realized for some time. There are so many avenues for risk assessment that the Biden Administration will have to take. Trump and his administration are the greatest intelligence threats this country has ever faced. \n\nDomestically our court systems have been filled with conservative judges that will assert irreproachable damage upon the rights of our people. Mitch McConnell gained everything he wanted, fill the district, circuit and Supreme Courts with conservative justices. We have seen a rise and emboldenment of white nationalism that has not been seen since the 1960s, we must stomp it out at all costs and go beyond the precedents of the past as they have failed. \n\nInternationally longstanding relationships, treaties and goals of America have been abandoned by the Trump administration further strengthening our enemies and weakening our diplomatic relations with others. There has never been a greater test to American legitimacy then the Trump administration. \n\nThis marks a very important chapter in the story that is America, I hope the Biden Administration can right the ship. We need to be beyond wary of the continuous attacks on our democracy by enemies both foreign and domestic (GOP) and we need to strengthen the foundations of our democracy with resolute speed. This is not the end of the war against our republic, this is just one step in the battle towards correcting our nation. We must continue to fight, we must continue to build a better future, not for ourselves but those who come after us. \n\n*A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.* \n\n-\tAnonymous Green Proverb",

Register with Planned Parenthood. Every citizen will be required to obtain at least one abortion each year that Joe Biden is in office. If you are not already pregnant, Joe Biden will correct that some time in the coming months. Be patient. Transfer of power is complicated, and these things take time.\n\n&gt;6. You should have received a government-issued Starbucks reusable travel mug. This is what you\u2019ll drink your coffee out of from now on. All coffee will be from Starbucks, and every drink will be half caff with soy milk and whipped cream.\n\nThey\u2019re all hilarious though so you should read the whole thing",

All smiles, then stabs you in the back.\u201d\n\nHe had been more furious and talked significantly more about football players kneeling than ever talking about A POLICEMAN GETTING BEAT TO DEATH WITH AMERICAN FLAGS.\u201d\n\nWith this kind of brainwashing, I know Biden will do what he can to reach across the isle, but how are we ever going to get past this as a country.  I have next to no hope.\n\nEdit:  whoops aisle *",

They realized their company was set-up to accept government contracts, so they went fishing for anything they could get. \n\nThey can pay 2-3x market cost for these masks to ensure they get supply, then double that, and sell to our government, who is not paying attention to prices. \n\nAll this will accomplish is driving up the price of masks... and that price difference is going right into the pocket of this asshole who runs the company. \n\nThen some Republican will say \u201csee how inefficient and corrupt government is?!?!?

My parents don't get the $1200 stimulus because they made too much money one year in 2018, but that's because they actually pay their taxes and don't cook the books or claim more losses. They were also paying their employees cash to help them out, which I know is illegal but they did it to help the employees. So on paper they made a ton of money. Even though last year and this year they are earning like a tenth of 2018's earnings. \n\nThey applied for a small business loan like you, but also like you the money is gone so they get nothing. The business is shut down and they are already talking of dissolving it and giving up which is brutal because they worked their entire life for this and it's their retirement. Without the company they have nothing and will have to get jobs again and probably work until they are dead.\n\nThey also filed for unemployment and were denied. So right now they have no income and no help from the government while Trump is handing out small business loans to his corporate buddies and stealing tax payer's money to enrich himself.\n\nThis is fucking bullshit. I was so proud to see my parents work from nothing to build a successful business on their own. Neither of them graduated high school. We were so poor growing up we were living in cars and motel rooms, digging in dumpsters for food. Then they finally scratch out a little part of their American dream just to have it destroyed. And that's not Trump's fault, but it is Trump's fault that they are getting zero assistance while large corporations get bailed out because of their own wrongdoing.\n\nThis is also going to fuck me because my sister also lost her job. She has 2 kids and bills and is struggling hard. I'm sure my parent's would have loaned her money but now they can't. Luckily I'm still working so I can help them all out but damn, there's only so much I can do. I'm one guy. I can't pay 3 rents, 3 sets of utilities, 3 car insurance payments etc. I'm selling my truck and giving half to my parents and half to my sister to try and help where I can. \n\nSorry for the rant. I'm just fucking fired up over how fucking horrible all this is.",

Punelli, one of Panthera's executives, told the Post that the company is working with military contacts to obtain the masks. \n\n&gt; \"We will provide these masks before May\u20091 for certain, in full and with a very high-quality product,\" Punelli said, telling the Post that the company is now registered as an LLC in Delaware. \n\n&gt; \"FEMA does not enter into contracts unless it has reason to believe they will be successfully executed. The required review led us to conclude that Panthera would able to deliver on their contract,\" the FEMA spokesperson went on to say. \"As with any contract if the company cannot deliver or delivers sub-standard product, the agency can use legal means against a company.\"\n\nSo Panthera is going to procure the masks for cheap (say $1/mask), then deliver them to FEMA for the contract price ($5.5/mask) and pocket the difference.  3M could fulfill this contract for something like $6m (given the math in the article), but Panthera gets the contract for $55m.  Obviously, this contract was designed to be a free money giveaway to some friend of whoever makes procurement decisions in the administration or FEMA.",

This contractor has an existing contract with DoD and has been handed a contract with markups and kick backs with a per unit cost ten times market value, similar to buying a $10 hammer for $3000.\nFraud, waste and abuse against the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) rules and laws.\n\nOnce impeached forever criminal, ask tricky Dick Nixon, Iam not a crook.",

She cannot preside when she is both a witness and a participant in actions taken to intentionally help DJT evade consequences and/or continue perpetrating the very crimes he\u2019s been indicted for.  The 11th district is hers and the case falls to her by default. She\u2019ll be expected to recuse. If she doesn\u2019t, DOJ will file objections and request removal. No way she hears this beyond T\u2019s initial court appearance.",

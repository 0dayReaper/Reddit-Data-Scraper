            "comment": "&gt;The silent witness rule is a practical, court-fashioned approach to prosecuting cases involving national security secrets. It attempts to protect the rights of the accused while also shielding classified information from public dissemination. Basically, it\u2019s a procedure in which a classified document is provided to the jury and other trial participants in its entirety, but witnesses refer to it in open court only in generalities and by using code words, like \u201cCountry A\u201d or \u201cForeign Leader Y.\u201d That way the trial remains open to the public but sensitive national defense information is not compromised.",

I expect that the person who held the highest office in the country and then proceeded to steal top secret information, reveal it to people without any security clearance, lie to the govt that they had it, move it around their different properties, possibly make copies of it, leave it on the floor of an unlocked storage room for anyone to see, brag about how classified it was, conceal it from his own attorney in order to keep it hidden, have an employee (a valet turned presidential assistant) have access to it should probably have bail denied or at the minimum travel and interaction with people extremely limited, seeing as he's a walking national security threat. It's insane he's not in isolation right now. Insane.",

They're generally pretty quick and boring affairs.\n\nAnd sure, it would have been nice to see him locked up, but we all knew that was never going to happen. And the government has a very unique angle in this case that rarely exists in others: they know *exactly* where Trump is at all times courtesy of the USSS. Bail/bond are aimed at preventing flight and ensuring appearance in court. Neither of those apply here.\n\nAgreed that given his treatment of classified info he *should* be in jail, but again we knew that wasn't going to happen. And like it or not, there are real and extreme risks courtesy of his insane followers.",

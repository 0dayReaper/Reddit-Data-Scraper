            "comment": "&gt;The silent witness rule is a practical, court-fashioned approach to prosecuting cases involving national security secrets. It attempts to protect the rights of the accused while also shielding classified information from public dissemination. Basically, it\u2019s a procedure in which a classified document is provided to the jury and other trial participants in its entirety, but witnesses refer to it in open court only in generalities and by using code words, like \u201cCountry A\u201d or \u201cForeign Leader Y.\u201d That way the trial remains open to the public but sensitive national defense information is not compromised.",

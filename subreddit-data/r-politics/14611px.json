Garland was appointed by Biden, and knew it was a bad look if he prosecuted Trump after Trump announced his intention to run against Biden in 2024. Smith was instructed to continue the investigation and only go where the facts take him. The only involvement that Biden has is not trying to stop it.",

There is no ambiguity.  The laws are clear.  The behavior is well documented.  It's all cut and dry.\n\nOf course it was going to get ready for trial sooner than the others.\n\nJ6 is not clear in comparison.  At least not regarding Trump himself.  If you focus on the perps that invaded buildings, it's clear.  But if you look at *only* Trump, it's rather nuanced and complicated.  It doesn't even rise to the clarity of \"will someone rid me of this meddlesome priest\".\n\nIt's bizarre because all of the overall plans were relatively unhidden.  But it seemed to bubble up from the bottom all over the place.  It seems yet possible that Trump just rode the waves.  Building a case with the certainty we see in this recent indictment is not trivial at all.",

I think the best bet for Jan 6 charged (whatever they might be) would be after Georgia and more document indictments drop, so that he would be so flooded with different law suites that are much more damning in terms of sentancing and facts that Jan 6 doesn't get any attention from Trump lawyers because there aren't that many of them, they aren't that good, and they are essentially defending one of the worst offenders in the history of the country.",

Because they just outlined two times he showed it to other people without clearence, but they were americans makes me think that the times he showed it to foreign states are going to be a part of a different indictment package, and that's likely going to be brought in DC as an overall charge, with mini charges in FL and NJ.",

I'm guessing that charges will be brought in other grand juries over the same case, this was Trump and Nauto conspiracy, the others are going to be Trump and et. al conspiracies for transporting and hoarding documents.  There is still the grand jury in DC for this case, seems like they just popped out the easy Mar-a-lago charges to the Florida Grand Jury as a starting point.  \n\nAnd then the Jan 6 stuff, whatever happens with that, could be even more devestating, or could be nothing, I don't really know at this point, we know people have been subpoenaed, and they are investigating, but we don't know if they will be able to make a case against Trump there, we just don't have enough information to really infer. \n\nBut I don't think the documents case is over, I think this is just step 1 - charge the basics where they are.  Step 2 will cover more and more about the dissemination.  \n\nConjecture and speculation on my part, but I really don't think these charges are all Trump gets for the documents, I think this is the first nail to the wall.",

(In addition to summoning Bannon for testimony, the subpoena also reportedly orders him to hand over documents.) Last year, Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison (and a fine of $6,500) for defying a subpoena from the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, with a judge saying he had not \u201ctaken responsibility for his actions\u201d and that \u201cothers must be deterred from committing similar crimes.\u201d (Bannon\u2019s sentence was suspended while he pursues appeals.)\n\n&gt;As for why Smith (and the House panel before him) would want to hear from Bannon, that likely has to do with the former White House official being one of many Trump allies who spread lies about the 2020 election being stolen, and saying on his podcast the day before the attack on the US Capitol that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d And as CNN notes, \u201cBannon also urged Trump in December 2020 to focus his attention on January 6, the date of the Electoral College certification vote in Congress, according to the book Peril, by authors Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. The authors also reported that Trump called Bannon after a contentious January 5 meeting with then vice president Mike Pence, where Pence told Trump he did not have the authority to block the certification of the 2020 election results.\u201d\n\narticle continues...",

They're all documented on past Twitter and social posts or video of him doing it. Spread his legal teams thin defending him.",

Very surprising and a very poignant and important piece of information for all who didn\u2019t know that he would do something like deny the charges in the most basic terms ever. \n \nPlease keep up the incredible work.

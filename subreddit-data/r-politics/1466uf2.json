Those secrets cannot be automatically declassified by the president alone and require, by law, extensive consultation with executive branch agencies.\n\n&gt;&gt; In all cases, however, a formal procedure is required so governmental agencies know with certainty what has been declassified and decisions memorialized.

A good 40-50% of their party will never give up on trump and never support anyone else unless he tells them to. And Trump will never support anyone but himself for president. \n\nSo what are their options? If trump wins the nomination, there\u2019s no way he wins the presidency. If he somehow loses the nomination, most of his hard core voters go with him, and repubs can\u2019t win the presidency. If the party tries to disown trump at this point, his hard core voters won\u2019t go along with it. They\u2019ll follow him wherever he goes. It\u2019s chaos and they know they\u2019re screwed.",

For fucks sake he had documents about our plans to attack Iran if it ever came to that and he boasted about it. Last I read he may have had documents about our nukes. Trump hid documents after having several chances to return them. We have a recording of Trump pressuring the governor of Georgia to \"just find 11,780 votes.\" I could go on for several paragraphs listing his crimes including financial fraud.\n\nWe have a two tiered justice system. One for the poor and another for the rich and powerful. The only time the rich go to prison is when they steal from the wealthy like Bernie Madoff. Stealing from the poor is the norm. At this point I don't know what it's going to take for Trump to go to prison. I don't think he ever will. Trump's lawyers will just litigate for years until he dies.\n\nIf the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class. We see this with wealthy people and corporations all the time. If a working class person gets traffic ticket that can be devastating for them financially. For a wealthy person it's a joke. To them it'd be like $2. I know in a few European countries the amount you have to pay is based on your income which is how it should be done. There are people so rich that they can spend $10,000 a day for 200 years and still remain billionaires by the end (if they could live that long but you get the point).\n\nIn the US 3 people have more money than the bottom 100,000,000. Corporations break the law and get fined millions. Sometimes hundreds of millions but it doesn't matter because they made tens of billions in profits so it just becomes the cost of doing business. Plus they have lobbyists and many of our politicians receive campaign contributions when they're running for elections. Lobbyists literally write the policies that they want.\n\nI truly believe the U.S. is fucked and I haven't even covered the now weekly mass shootings, insane housing prices, inflation, MAGA insanity, racism, rising fascism, bigotry, atrocious healthcare system, awful mental health situation, the fact that like 60% of people live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford a $400 emergency, the list goes on. \n\n*Edit: It's 2am and I'm going by memory so some of my stats may be off.

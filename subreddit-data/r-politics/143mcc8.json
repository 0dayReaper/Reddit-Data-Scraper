                            "comment": "I agree with what you said except for possibly that there are more total Democrats than Republicans in Texas, mainly because Texas consistently elects Republican governors and Senators through statewide elections and gerrymandering has basically no effect on those. If there were actually significantly more Democrats than Republicans statewide we would probably not still see Abbott and Cruz in office for example, even though gerrymandering would mean the state legislature would likely remain GOP controlled. And similarly Texas voted for Trump by a 52% to 46% margin in 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Incumbency isn\u2019t playing a role here. If the split between Dems and the GOP is roughly around 50/50 then Abbott and Cruz being incumbents does give them enough of an edge to get reelected for instance. And it wouldn\u2019t shock me if Texas is trending toward becoming more Democratic statewide as the state GOP continues down the MAGA hat root. But until I actually see a statewide election in Texas result in a Democratic win I\u2019ll be skeptical it\u2019s not at least 50/50 GOP.\n\nP.S. Also voter suppression can play a role as well similar to the incumbent advantage. Again, not enough to outweigh a significant Democratic advantage probably but enough to swing things a few points.",

If Floridians were smart they would insist he put his presidential hopes aside and take care of these expensive court cases that are going to pop up with more frequency.

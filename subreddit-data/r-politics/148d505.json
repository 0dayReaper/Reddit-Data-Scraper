No doubt he would have put Hillary and Biden on trial if he could.  They still scream about Benghazi and investigated it for 3 years and found nothing but maybe the state department could have acted quicker.  All lies and always has been.",

They had a token democrat for them all to attack but the way they attacked was so unabashedly it was actually shocking. The head anchor then went into this interview with barr and began to complain about hunter Biden.\n\n Every time I do this to see what the opposition party is thinking to whatever news is of the moment I'm continually amazed at the willful ignorance of the fox ethos and the absurd redundancy to what their fixations are. At this rate they will be talking about hunter Biden dick pics for 6yrs, a person with no power and who is in no authority position. And their viewers are all about it.",

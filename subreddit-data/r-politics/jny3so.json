If they've got a problem and need help from the government, they can talk to their representatives at the state and federal level. They don't need special treatment from the president in order to make sure their voices are heard.",

Suddenly, you actually need to listen to people from all states. The reality today is that candidates don't really care about states that will definitely vote against them. Look at how Trump treats blue states! He wanted people from them *to die of COVID to spite them, for fuck's sake!*",

They\u2019ve been told that every problem they face is a byproduct of Democratic policy. They\u2019ve been told that if they elect a Democrat, the economy will collapse and they\u2019ll be ignored and everything they value will be taken away...they\u2019ll lose their guns and immigrants will run rampant through the streets and crime will overrun their small, sleepy, real American town. \n\nThey\u2019d rather lose the country, because in their mind democratic leadership means the loss of their country. It doesn\u2019t matter that Trump is antithetical to their values...that if you described Trump without calling him Trump they\u2019d assume he was a bad person. They just don\u2019t want a socialist to take over and start to...I don\u2019t know what...give them healthcare options and work toward lowering the cost of higher education. \n\nSo yeah, they ignore any evidence that Trump is a failed leader, and they lovingly absorb any evidence that Biden is corrupt and incompetent. And there\u2019s absolutely no way to change their mind. \n\nIn short...48% of our country has absolutely lost their mind, to a point that we won\u2019t ever get that 48% back and it may actually bring about the end of American democracy.",

However, after it became clear how that went down in Germany, the entire rhetoric died almost instantly.\n\nThe cynical outcome of that is that the right wing propaganda needs some sort of real life \"correction\" that makes people remember who the fuck they are and what is important in life. That was WW2 to Europe, and so many of the current institutions like universal healthcare in almost all western european countries are partly the way they are because of the eagerness of post-war Europe to rebuild and not fuck up so badly again. It's only now, that the war is too far away for anyone to remember, that people in Europe are flocking back to bigotry, though not as much as in the US still.\n\nAmerica never had that mental correction. Yes, America went to war, but outside of Hawaii, the war never reached America the way it did Europe, never reached their personal lives in a similarly impactful way as you would have if you were invaded, or found out your government was genocidal. Especially rural America, where you could probably live entire lives without noticing anything that went on in the 21st century anywhere else. Rural America seems like such an isolated culture, which is such an easy prey for propagandists, as there isn't a whole lot in the culture internally to build your own rhetoric on.",

This is a nation that has tramped around the world selling/forcing their version of democracy as the 'ideal' version to be replicated and they have roughly the size of one high school making the decision of who their leader is to represent 376 million people... it's incredible.",

The only thing keeping us from being blue through and through is the distribution of liberals throughout the country. Liberals need to start moving to these battleground states and stop running up the numbers on the coasts. Rent is too damn high in CA anyways.\n\n(Edit: by overwhelmingly I mean democratically (small \"d\") and historically. Democratically overwhelming as in if we were talking about where americans down to the individual preferred Biden to Trump the answer would be Biden by millions of people. And historically speaking, Republicans have won the popular vote only once since 1988 with no sign of this trend reversing. At executive level, liberal policy consistency routs conservative policy when you look at the raw nationwide voting data.)",

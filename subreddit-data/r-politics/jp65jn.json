An increase from last year where they still voted for DJT as a majority. \n\nNo one is dismissing those who showed up for BLM and stood with them. \n\nThe facts are these, if Black Americans had a split vote like white America, who knows how the vote would have gone. Well, I could speculate it'd be DJT, and I'd most likely be right, but I'm no psychic. \n\nIf this election says anything to me, it means that white people have much more they need to do with voter outreach. Because these people who voted for DJT, didn't just turn into racists overnight. They most likely have always been racist, and because white people value a peaceful Thanksgiving and peaceful Christmas, their racist uncle's/father's/mother's are allowed to believe their feelings are valid, because silence is a tacit approval of those reprehensible views. \n\nTo all the white folks who voted for Biden, thank you. To all the other POC, thank you. I'm gonna continue doing the work to increase Democrats in the Asian American voting block. \n\nTo the black Americans who consistently stand against the likes of DJT, thank you. I see you and I appreciate you.",

SInce the direct line is:\n\n\n\"No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.\"\n\n\nSo this exact this is EXPRESSLY against the OK state constitution, and the state supreme court has been consistent with striking down a lot of the bills lately, all but one abortion bill got killed(and that is the one from the 50's), not all but some of the anti-trans bills have been struck down, and I would be shocked if this wasn't as well.",

The end goal, which some Republican leaders barely bother to hide anymore, is to destroy the concept of secular education entirely. \n\n&gt; The state's Republican school superintendent, Ryan Walters, is not discreet about his contempt for the existence of secular, reality-based education. His hatred of schools that teach real science and history is so intense, in fact, it makes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis look less fascist in comparison. During the campaign, Walters didn't just demand that schools whitewash history and complain that learning facts leads students to believe \"this country is an evil place full of bigoted racists.\" He also called for teacher training and real history books to be replaced with materials from the far-right Christian Hillsdale College.  \n\nThe thing is, it doesn't even need to be history lessons. Learning facts like **what Republican politicians are currently doing** is sufficient to prove that the country is full of evil bigoted racists.",

Therefore, it (the vote) was 2-2 and was voted down. Strawn said, \u2018I\u2019m with Brian on his constitutional alignment concerns.\u2019 He (Bobek) shouldn\u2019t have been seated in the seat; he shouldn\u2019t have been able to say what he said, based on what the Attorney General\u2019s Office opinion is.\u201d\n\nFurther, there\u2019s a question of whether Beauchamp was inappropriately removed in order to put Bobek on the board. \n\n&gt;In an email, Batt first quoted directly from the state statute that created the current Statewide Virtual Charter School Board: \u201c\u2019Members shall serve until their successors are duly appointed for a term of three (3) years. Appointments shall be made by and take effect on November 1 of the year in which the appointment is made.\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt;Later in the letter she wrote: \u201cIndeed, it is my understanding that Mr. Beauchamp requested to be reappointed and was only made aware of his replacement on the afternoon of (Friday) June 2, 2023. Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s continued service demonstrates that there was not a vacancy to warrant the immediate placement of Mr. Bobek on the Board. Accordingly, it is my opinion that pursuant to 51 O.S. \u00a7 15, Mr. Beauchamp should continue serving until his successor, Mr. Bobek, is duly qualified on November 1 pursuant to the provisions of 70 O.S. \u00a7 3-145.1(B).\u201d\n\nCompounding all of that, there\u2019s also the little issue of the new law OK passed this year\u2026\n\n&gt;Senate Bill 516, which was just signed into law by Gov. Stitt on Monday, will do away with the board in 2024 and create a new governing board with expanded authority over all charter schools.\n\n&gt;Pointedly, SB 516 states: \u201cA charter school shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations. A sponsor may not authorize a charter school or program that is affiliated with a nonpublic sectarian school or religious institution.\u201d",

The backers of this probably are betting that Christian schools would end up getting the largest amount of funding anyway simply by virtue of how many Christians there are in the country versus a lot of other religions. Muslims, Wiccans, Jews, Satanic Temple, etc, only makes up a few percent or so of the population. The great majority are either some Christian denomination or not religious. So if SCOTUS rules, for example, that if a state fully funds charter schools it must also be allowing religious schools of all denominations to apply for funding, then the great majority of those religious schools will end up being Christian ones simply by virtue of the demographics anyway, there would be no need for the religious justices SCOTUS to make a special carve out only for them.",

            "comment": "In the 1800\u2019s, there was a growing concern about the creeping influence of Roman Catholicism (namely from immigrants) throughout the mostly-Protestant nation.\n\nIn 1875, minority speaker James Blaine proposed an amendment to the US Constitution. The so-called Blaine Amendment proposed text was:\n\n&gt;No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.\n\nIt failed in the Senate and was never passed federally, however some 35-odd states pushed through amendments mirroring the sentiment to their own state constitutions.\n\nOne of those states is Oklahoma. \n\nArticle 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma State Constitution reads: \n\n&gt;No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest,\npreacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.\n\nIn 2015, Montana passed a version of the tax credit voucher system to fund scholarship programs for low income students to attend private schools. Abiding by their own Blaine Amendment in their state constitution, this program had a \u201cno-aid\u201d provision that specifically excluded parochial schools from participating. \n\nA group of parents, backed by libertarian group Institute for Justice, sued, alleging that the program discrimination against parochial schools violated the Establishment clause of the US Constitution and asked that the court open the program to parochial schools as redress. The case, *Espinoza v Montana Department of Revenue*, proceeded to the Montana Supreme Court, who ruled that the program itself was unconstitutional according to their state Blaine Amendment as the program could not prevent public dollars from going to private schools under the current program design. They ordered the program to stop entirely.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court and in 2020, the conservative-led USSC released a narrow decision that the \u201cno-aid\u201d provision in their voucher program was unconstitutional as it violated the Free Exercise clause- with Roberts writing the majority opinion. The program\u2019s prohibition against parochial school participation was the focus, with Roberts writing it violated the US constitution as it \u201cbars religious schools from public benefits solely because of the religious character of the schools\" and \"also bars parents who wish to send their children to a religious school from those same benefits, again solely because of the religious character of the school.\" \n\nRoberts also asserted that the Montana Supreme Court was wrong to invalidate the entire program on the basis of the no-aid provision in the state constitution. Roberts wrote that \"A state need not subsidize private education. But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.\"\n\n**Only Alito touched on the constitutionality of the Blaine Amendment that the Montana \u201cno-aid\u201d provision was based on in his concurrent opinion, stating that the Montana State Constitutional Blaine amendment might violate the US constitution Free Exercise clause.** The ruling kneecapped the Blaine Amendment in Montana but didn\u2019t outright rule it out and left Blaine Amendments largely untouched in the other 35-odd states that still have them.\n\nBecause the decision in *Espinoza* was such a narrow decision that it didnt directly comment on the constitutionality of Blaine Amendments, they\u2019re still in effect for the states that have them. GOP leaders in states like Oklahoma and Texas (and others) now see blood in the water. \n\n**These proposed  laws are designed to defy the Blaine Amendment in our state constitution in hopes they will be challenged in court.** They would likely prevail in conservative state courts but the anticipation is that the plaintiffs would appeal all the way up to a very conservative-friendly Supreme Court. *Espinoza* was ruled 5-4, with Ginsburg writing the dissent.  Not only would the ruling likely be 6-3, the hope is that the justices might rule all state Blaine Amendments as unconstitutional, succeeding where *Espinoza* didn\u2019t and paving the way for vouchers to benefit parochial schools throughout the nation. \n\nIn short, passing these laws is just a stepping stone to further the goals of the GOP/Federalist Society/Christian Nationalists to steer public dollars to parochial institutions, thereby choking the life out of public schools by diverting their dollars and instituting their view of a nation based on their Christian faith.",

He has never held an executive position. He hasn't had to balance competing interests. Academic life channels people into diving deep into niche interests, and fighting over tiny distinctions, the opposite of what a politician needs to do. As a candidate, he faces not just racism, but the anti intellectual streak in public opinion. He can't possibly win and he knows or should know it. The stakes are high for getting good judges, environmental policy, protecting rights. We are still trying to repair the damage Trump did . We need a good president.",

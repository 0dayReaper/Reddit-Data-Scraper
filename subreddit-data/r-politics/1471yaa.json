Is it **The People** or is it **the Militia**.\n\nYou may want to re-read the 2nd Amendment to figure that one out.\n\nThis is confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n &gt; 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2\u201353.\n\n &gt;     (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n\n &gt;     (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n\n&gt;       (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n\n &gt;     (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n\n&gt;      (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.",

Militia: composition and classes\n(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n\n&gt;(b) The classes of the militia are\u2014\n\n&gt;(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and\n\n&gt;(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.\n\nBut remember that the right to keep and bear arms is in no way shape or form connected to membership in a militia.\n\n&gt;\"The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.\"\n- Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824\n\n&gt;\"The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.\"\n- Samuel Adams, Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, 1788\n\n&gt;\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\"\n- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776\n\n&gt;\"This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty.... The right of self defense is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\"\n- St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, 1803\n\n&gt;\"The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.\"\n- Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833\n\n&gt;\"What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty ....

This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\"\n- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28, January 10, 1788\n\n&gt;\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.\"\n- Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, October 10, 1787\n\n&gt;\"What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty .... Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.\"\n- Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, I Annals of Congress 750, August 17, 1789\n\nYou seem to be mistaken about the meaning of well regulated amd it's place in our 2nd Amendment.\n\nYou're referencing the prefatory clause (A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State), which is merely a stated reason and is not actionable. \n\nThe operative clause, on the other hand, is the actionable part of the amendment (the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed).\n\nWell regulated does NOT mean government oversight. You must look at the definition at the time of ratification.\n\nThe following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n\n1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n\n1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n\n1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n\n1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n\n1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n\n1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n\nThe phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. \n\nThis is confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n &gt; 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2\u201353.\n\n &gt;     (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n\n &gt;     (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n\n&gt;       (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n\n &gt;     (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n\n&gt;      (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.",

Sometimes they don't really have a choice because the other option is to be stalked and killed, which by the way is another thing more likely to happen if your stalker has a gun. They are kept in a state of terror by right-wing media, their churches, their families, and their communities. These women are seldom conscious of this, but they believe men are their only source of value and salvation. If it's not their shit boyfriends or shit husbands on whom they base their identities and self-worth, it's their shit fathers or their shit sons.\n\nMeanwhile, the shit men in their lives believe they're very chivalrous and honorable for \"defending their women's honor,\" and the women go with it because it's a kind of symbiotic protection they wouldn't otherwise have. Being a woman and rebuffing honor culture means men are free to do what they want you, and most rural women would rather be domestically-abused quislings of the patriarchy than suffer those other alien indignities. It's pure better-him-than-me logic. The rage and violence of their shit men cannot be shut off or negated - only turned aside. They cannot even imagine an emotionally-healthy man who deals with his feelings in a constructive way.\n\nThese women are disgusting and pathetic, stuck partly by their own will in a slave mentality because the alternative is terrifying and potentially deadly, but most of them were raised by mothers as enabling and codependent as they are. Many of them know absolutely nothing else.\n\nI don't know firsthand how they are in big cities because I've never lived in one, only visited. But this is the life of a *rural* GOP woman: a pitiable domestic slave, an unpaid bangmaid, with delusions of agency granted her by the shit men practicing honor culture. It's just enough to survive on that she laps up these worthless crumbs and thanks her kind master for his generosity. She is nonetheless dangerous if she votes or if she decides to follow the path of Carolyn Bryant, who made hOnOr CuLtUrE work for *her.*",

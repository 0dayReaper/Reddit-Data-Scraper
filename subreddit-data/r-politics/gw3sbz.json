It's unbelievable. \n\nI suspect the Trump cult will try to rehash a 2001 incident to smear Mattis. After the initial invasion of Afghanistan Mattis didn't provide support to a Special Forces detachment after they accidentally bombed their own position. He had no situational awareness of the incident and didn't want to send his guys into a potential ambush. Another reason why his guys probably love him.",

Now I too have nothing but the utmost respect for him and would pretty much do anything he ordered me to do if I served under him. You too have an idea of his reputation and if you truly believe that he'd have sat idle while people tear down, vandalize monuments and attempt to harm others not just in the capital but around the country I absolutely and wholeheartedly disagree. I feel that his actions with the national guard would have been Swift and made a point that he won't stand for that behavior... Now maybe he's greasing up the future wheels for presidency down the road (\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc oh sweet baby Jesus please) so the best thing is to start spotlighting things he can do differently... But again I'm sure you have heard of his reputation as well and know the hard ass and bad ass he is...

I couldn't understand how Trump could get rid of this man, and still have support!\n\nI hope this is as groundbreaking to the country as it is to me...",

Speaking as a veteran, as a conservative, as a man who was disappointed to see Mattis step down as SECDEF because I saw him as the sole man of integrity around the President, I am very glad to hear him make this public statement. I only wish he had made it sooner, and that people who respected him yesterday still respect him today after these remarks. It is because of the values he has that earned him our respect that he has said what he has.",

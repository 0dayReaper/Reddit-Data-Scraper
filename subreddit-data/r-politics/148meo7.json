People are acting like the person you responded to because:\n\nTrump blatantly got away with a LOT of crimes in *just* the few years he was in office. This does not count tax fraud or any other fraudulent activity outside of being the President and his *actual* criminal behavior before the Presidency was just as awful, just as brash and just as blatant. \n\nPeople are acting like they can't wait until they get to visibly see Trump wilt like the dying, poisonous barbed plant that he is. It's been a long time coming. We suffered through Covid, a gigantically traumatic virus that affected millions. And *he* just so happened to tbe President during that time.\n\nPeople lost family members and friends and during a CRUCIAL time for a nation to ACTUALLY come together? sure enough, it was during his time in office. People are celebrating that he is finally facing brand new legal shit he's NEVER had to deal with because this nation is **supposed** to be about practically everything that Trump is *not*.\n\nAnd that's just one of his many, many, many, many failings. One.\n\nThey are celebrating and saying things like \"looking forward to\" because it's a form of *catharsis*. There's a type of newton's law at play. Those actions from Trump years ago and seemingly never-ending to this day?\n\nHad equal, but *opposite* reactions. And when national security is involved with a crime he committed?\n\nThey have every right to celebrate the DoJ and the foundations of law actually functioning.",

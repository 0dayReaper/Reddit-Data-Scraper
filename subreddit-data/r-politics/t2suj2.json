He's nowhere near as stupid as he lets on, and his whole schtick relies on convincing people that he's ignorant of certain things. He is laying out the playbook for a Mussolini style shift in the Republican party, and it's been insanely effective. He's purposefully harnessing left wing talking points that are popular with the vast majority of working class Americans while wrapping the whole thing in white nationalist rhetoric. He has been a huge part of the extreme right wing shift we've seen in recent years, and the fact the Job Stewart owned him once a decade ago doesn't undo that fact. If the left isn't prepared to effectively counter the shift he's laying the ground work for in the coming years, we will be buried. I think it's a huge mistake to underestimate that effect.",

The infrastructure he has also laid has given the new left multiple open routes to conquer the right wing base, without them ever knowing any better. Consider Fox's ratings when Bernie pays a visit, or the anti-capitalist undertones of these trucker protests. \n\nI see knew growth in left, anti-liberal messaging as a direct result of Tucker's experiments with leftist-speech.\nHe laid down a language highway that previously did not exist, for better or worse. Such in-roads have far greater potential to be used for the good of all socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nWeird times, nonetheless.",

Waiting\u2026 more waiting\u2026 \n\nThen at the last minute\u2026 umm what do we do with all of this shit? I don\u2019t know\u2026 just box up everything and send it to Florida and they\u2019ll figure it out there.  \n\nMonths later\u2026 the Archives asks for stuff and Trump defaults to being defiant. I don\u2019t have your stuff.  Everything here is mine.  Those boxes? Those are mine too.  Trump has no idea what\u2019s in those boxes. He\u2019s not worried about the classified documents. He\u2019s worried what else might be in there. Notes, pictures, financial records, etc\u2026  i.e. a ton of shit that could get him in serious trouble.  \n\nI think that\u2019s why he was moving them around to go through them himself.  He had gone through some in the past and found some neato top secret mementos, etc\u2026  But, he also knew there was stuff he wouldn\u2019t want law enforcement to see. Of course, Trump in his nature made everything a million times worse with his lies, etc\u2026 \n\nLiterally, the stupidest of crimes.",

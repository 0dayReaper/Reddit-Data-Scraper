By \u201canti all the things\u201d I mean anti gay, anti trans, anti minority, anti dissent, anti socialist, anti communist, anti union, anti Justice, anti labor, among other things. Right wing pundits and politicians talk about woke people, the left, etc in worryingly dehumanizing ways and blame them for everything wrong in the world in a way that resembles nazi anti semitic propaganda. There\u2019s one extremist christian radio channel in particular that really worries me. What that particular group wants keeps turning into real world policy.",

You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me\u2014because obviously sitting around saying, \"We want to cut this,\" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \"N-gger, n-gger.\" -Lee Atwater",

What I'm referring to specifically in the examples I provided, was writing that was changed from the original script to a \"woke\" script, which is fine, but the new writing was not even close to the quality of the original, the quality of writing was impressive in how terrible it was. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm sure there are woke rewrites that have great writers and no one says anything because it works, writing is good. But when the writing is clearly bad, and the reason for quality loss is clear, then the frustration should be common sense.",

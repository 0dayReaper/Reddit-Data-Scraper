            "comment": "The Broward County, Florida school district includes Stoneman Douglas High School, where clear backpacks were temporarily required after the mass shooting in February 2018:\n\n&gt; Among those opposed to the district-wide proposal is School Board Chair Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was murdered at MSD in 2018.\n\n&gt; \u201cI send my two boys to school with a bulletproof backpack,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI am against having clear backpacks for our students. It\u2019s a false sense of security.\u201d\n\n&gt; MSD students protested the move five years ago, stuffing their clear bags with feminine hygiene products and signs calling for gun control. One student even filled up their backpack with water and a fish, turning it into a portable fish tank, according to reporting by The Eagle Eye, MSD\u2019s school newspaper.\n\n&gt; Echoing arguments made in 2018, critics at the town hall characterized the proposal as both overbearing and inadequate \u2014 a major invasion of student privacy, they said, that wouldn't be effective at meeting the district\u2019s larger goal of keeping weapons out of Broward County Public Schools.",

She said some parents would rather have metal detectors at every point of entry, but that's not actually been formally proposed. (It's expensive and controversial for other reasons.)  \n\n\nThere's also an update: After the town hall meeting last night (June 12), the Broward County school board added an agenda item to the meeting today to scrap the proposed clear backpack policy.",

Let that sink in for a minute, she is trying to protect her kids by making them wear bullet proof items to school every day. She is opposed to replacing that bulletproof item with a clear plastic item. I fully understand fighting someone taking away an item that allows her to send her children to school. As a parent, if I so much as see cops with lights and sirens racing in the direction of my kids' school I am terrified. I can't wrap my mind around how she manages to get through each day. \n\nYou point out that prisons have metal detectors, but so do courthouses, most state and federal buildings, many concert venues, sporting events, theme parks, airports, and so on. They are not as rare as one might think they are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to high school in So. Cal. in the '90s. Our threats were centered around gangs and bombs. Our school districts had many similar conversations as we are having today. \n\nMany LA and Ventura county school districts landed on metal detectors and clear backpacks as well as K-9 units on campus. These measures were scaled back or eliminated within the decade after. \n\nSan Diego County schools did away with lockers, which they have not replaced.\n\nThere were arguments about violations of rights because we were subject to searches of our person or belongings at any given moment by staff as well as police. Parents now fight with schools about the seizure of cell phones, for us it was pagers.",

I lived there when students were going from county to county and sobbing to congress people during open town halls, begging for stricter gun reform. Every single sitting official that opposes gun control as a safety to protect kids in school is a fucking monster. These kids were and still are fucking traumatized. I met and spoke with a few of them, and they all were genuinely distraught and desperate. You have to be a fucking sociopath to look at these kids and their families who are in very real pain and fear and unironically suggest things like clear backpacks and bulletproof backpacks.",

            "comment": "The Broward County, Florida school district includes Stoneman Douglas High School, where clear backpacks were temporarily required after the mass shooting in February 2018:\n\n&gt; Among those opposed to the district-wide proposal is School Board Chair Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was murdered at MSD in 2018.\n\n&gt; \u201cI send my two boys to school with a bulletproof backpack,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI am against having clear backpacks for our students. It\u2019s a false sense of security.\u201d\n\n&gt; MSD students protested the move five years ago, stuffing their clear bags with feminine hygiene products and signs calling for gun control. One student even filled up their backpack with water and a fish, turning it into a portable fish tank, according to reporting by The Eagle Eye, MSD\u2019s school newspaper.\n\n&gt; Echoing arguments made in 2018, critics at the town hall characterized the proposal as both overbearing and inadequate \u2014 a major invasion of student privacy, they said, that wouldn't be effective at meeting the district\u2019s larger goal of keeping weapons out of Broward County Public Schools.",

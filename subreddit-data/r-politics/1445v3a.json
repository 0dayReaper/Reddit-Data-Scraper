So 22.5 million potential voters.\n\n[dallesNews](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/02/10/texas-surpasses-17-million-registered-voters-as-early-voting-starts-monday-for-2022-primary-election/) posted this article in 2022 stating that more than 17 million voters were registered for the primaries, although the actual turnout is abysmal in midterm years (averaging 10% of *registered voter* turnout, while the Presidential years have done much better in regards to voter turnout.  From the above article:\n\n&gt;In the November 2020 election, 67% of registered voters turned out \u2014 a seven-point jump from the previous presidential contest in 2016.\n\nNow finding specific party breakdowns are a bit rougher, as in Texas you don't register with a specific party to vote, but looking at ballotopedia.org and the 2016 elections as a guide:\n\n&gt;In the\u00a02016 election, Trump carried Texas with 52.2% of the vote to\u00a0Hillary Clinton's (D) 43.2%.\n\nSo still can't find any concrete numbers for voters by party, but Wikipedia has a decent write up of the 2020 Presidential elections where they state:\n\n&gt;Although it was considered a vulnerable state for Trump by some pollsters and experts and a potential upset victory for Biden due to its recent demographic trends, Trump held Texas with 52.1% of the vote, roughly the same percentage he carried it with in 2016. Biden improved on Hillary Clinton's 2016 vote share by 3.24%, giving him the largest percentage in the state by a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter carried the state in 1976. Trump's 5.58% margin of victory was also the narrowest for a Republican since 1996. Texas was the third-narrowest of Trump's state victories, behind only Florida and North Carolina, and the ninth-closest state overall. The election was also the first time Texas placed in the top ten closest states since 1968, and the first time since 1976 that Texas voted to the left of Ohio.[5][6] As in most other states in 2020, Trump significantly outperformed his polling.[7][8] Voter turnout in the state increased to its highest level since 1992, when two Texans, George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, were on the ballot, and the last time Texas was a battleground state.[9]\n\n[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas).\n\nThe state is closer than its been to flipping in decades, but the big takeaway for me is inspiring turnout.  It's damn near an even split, when looking at Presidental election years in any case.  Pushing the Get-Out-The-Vote initiatives is likely going to be a winning strategy moving forward (and I would argue it's been key since 2008 and Preaident Obama's win).",

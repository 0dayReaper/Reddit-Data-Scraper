Just, wow.\n\nI\u2019m a \u201cVote Blue No Matter Who\u201d for the rest of my life, but Jesus Christ\u2014we need better leadership. Democrats are *absolutely furious* and these clowns start singing? God help us.\n\nEdit 1: To everyone replying, \"Vote Blue No Matter Who is the problem,\" you're not wrong, but let's be real: we don't have another option right now. This is a simple, inescapable truth: *if you're not voting for the party opposing Republicans, you're voting for Republicans. If you're not trying to stop them, you're helping them.* I wish that weren't true, but it is. \n\nIf you voted for Jill Stein, in other words, this is on your hands. If you refrain from voting because the Democratic candidate isn't left-leaning enough for you, please say out loud when gay marriage is repealed and you can't get your birth control, \"I did this.\" And if you want to re-shape the Democratic party, VOTE IN THE PRIMARIES. Do you hear me? VOTE IN THE PRIMARIES. Vote for progressive Democrats that will re-shape the party and actually fix our broken country.\n\nEdit 2: To the conservatives sending me the \"RedditCaresResources,\" a heartfelt *thank you* for doing something so on-brand: taking a tool that's supposed to help people and perverting it. That's what you guys do--you take things people have built and break them, because you can't build anything yourselves. You're literally why we can't have nice things.",

Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett were all asked if they would respect *stare decisis* (treating previous decisions as settled precedent) with respect to Roe, to which they said yes, by the principle of *stare decisis* Roe is clearly settled, but clearly they fucking lied.\n\nIt\u2019s a small distinction but a legally important one.\n\nEDIT: People are asking, what can we do? MLK was right when he said moderates are the enemy of change. Too long have we practiced \u201ccivility\u201d and let moderates hide from the consequences of their votes behind their own willful ignorance.  Fuck polite Thanksgiving dinners, call your family members out. Have the uncomfortable discussions with your coworkers and friends. Vote in every local, state, and national election, and get in the habit of calling your representatives and elected officials to demand action. Talk about a general strike. Organize, disrupt, demand. Shift the Overton window.\n\nI will never advocate for violence, but the time has long since passed to use all other available means to put these fascists where they fucking belong, in the dustbin of history. We are losing this fight, it\u2019s time to start acting like it. Be the change.",

When Ruth Bader Ginsberg died, they didn't pause and reflect on the passing of an era: they rejoiced at her death. They celebrate when police officers gun down someone of the wrong skin color.\n\nThey are a party and cult of death and destruction.",

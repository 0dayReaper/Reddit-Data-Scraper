If the others come at him softly, he will ride his current advantage to victory. If they come at him hard enough to win, then they probably alienate a portion of Trumps base along the way. Republican's need every single conservative/evangelical/racist voter to come out in support if they want to win the general election. Even losing just a couple % of Trump's base likely results in a loss.",

Trump (amongst Republicans) is/was the most popular presidential candidate that they've had in years. Problem is that \"popular amongst Republicans\" doesn't translate to \"popular amongst the general population,\" Trump never did win the popular vote. Republicans know this, hence why Republican controlled state legislatures across the country have been growing ever more desperate in their attempts at electioneering.\n\nRepublicans have all but given up on getting the popular vote and are hoping to get just enough votes that, through gaming the system, they can kind of sort of if you squint a bit, look like they won legitimately.",

So telling your average conservative that CNN is a conservative owned network now will get some laughs, not much else. After maybe 10-15 years, numerous discussions with fellow conservatives, they may slowly start to collectively learn that CNN is conservative, but it won't be a fast process.",

How can you grow it?\n\nYou can either convince people who don't watch cable news to start watching, which... apparently they've given up on.\n\nYou can go after the 25% or so who watch MSNBC. Those viewers are mostly liberal so to do it you'd have to move to the left of MSNBC. You're already perceived as \"center-left\" so you can't really go anywhere else.\n\nOr you can go after the 60% or so who watch Fox News and OAN and Newsmax, the conservative networks. \n\nYou can't get to the right of OAN and Newsmax, but maybe you can put yourself center-right. The reasonable Republican demographic. Try to get a quarter of those Fox News watchers... 500,000. You'd double your ratings!\n\nWell that was the plan, anyway.",

The news should be funded like the fire department, and allowed to question the core sociological ideas that have driven us into such a dismal situation, so that democracy can actually function.",

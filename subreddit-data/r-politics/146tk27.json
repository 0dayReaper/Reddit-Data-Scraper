Trump says the indictment is \u201cthe most horrible abuse of power\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d He should watch HBO\u2019s docudrama \u201cReality,\u201d which assiduously walks through the arrest by Trump\u2019s Justice Department of Reality Winner, the National Security Agency translator who leaked one classified document and was sentenced to more than five years in prison.\n\n&gt; Winner was a contractor who saw a classified NSA report detailing Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election via a cyberattack on a voting software supplier and phishing emails aimed at local election officials. She sent it to The Intercept, which made it public.\n\n\n&gt; The leak was a violation of the law, and for it, Winner paid a steep price. For exposing one secret document that gave the American people information it likely had a right to know, the Air Force vet \u2014 who pleaded guilty \u2014 got the longest sentence ever imposed for the unauthorized release of government information to the media.",

Betsy Reed was editor-in-chief at the Intercept at the time and she sent the leaked documents to the NSA to verify without any preventative measures. The NSA was able to look at marking to determine where the document came from. In a sane world, Betsy Reed would never be trusted with an editorial position again, but she not only stayed at the Intercept after that, but is now working for Guardian US. Absolutely insane...",

Reality Winner saw these interviews and knew they were lies because she could see the actual intelligence report showing proof that it definitively had been Russia, and in her anger she anonymously released the document to the press. \n\nThat document showed the FEC flaws in their security for conducting elections which was being kept from them by the Trump administration (because, again, it would have hurt his narrative about Russia), and Winner releasing that document directly led to us having more secure elections in 2018 and beyond. For her heroic act that helped every American, the Trump administration threw the book at her, sentencing her to the longest prison sentence ever for violating the Espionage Act, and painted her as a terrorist in the press. We all owe Reality Winner a debt of gratitude, and I hope Trump rots in jail for his crimes.",

I feel like I've been Mandela'd cause I never that was leaked, I thought the government just announced it.\n\nYou're not wrong.\n\nRussian interference in the US election by way of hacking and influence campaigns was publicly known and announced/affirmed by the intelligence community *in 2016*. Including that they were seeking to penetrate state election systems and offices.\n\n&gt; Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company.\n\n[-Joint statement from DHS and ODNI, October 7, 2016](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national)\n\nThey published [another joint report on December 29, 2016](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/12/29/joint-dhs-odni-fbi-statement-russian-malicious-cyber-activity) which went into [more detail](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf) about the methods used by Russian entities as well as concrete ways to prevent future vulnerabilities.\n\nThe intelligence agencies' report about Russian activities in the election, an overview with some but not all details, was [published on Jan 6, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf).\n\nWinner's leak, which specifically revealed the IC's awareness of Russia's efforts to hack registrars, state election agencies, election software contactors, and other related entities, was [published on June 5, 2017](https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/) (*after* her arrest, since the Intercept was so comically incompetent at protecting their source).\n\nMore details about efforts to attack state and local election entities were later [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/russian-breach-of-39-states-threatens-future-u-s-elections) by [mainstream outlets](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html) and [released by govt entities](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-tell-21-states-they-were-targeted-during-election/) and investigations.\n\nSo, yeah, when the leak happened, it wasn't exactly news. It did add some details. But the media covered it breathlessly as if it was a wholly new revelation, while in October '16, they were more focused on the FBI reopening the Clinton email investigation thanks to Weiner's wiener than on the whole Russia trying to hack the election story. The two were often accorded roughly equal attention and weight as if similar or equivalent.\n\nThe investigations into Russian interference in 2016, including the broad concept of them trying to hack state and local election offices, was indeed known well before this leak, and the investigations into it were ongoing and classified at the time of this leak. Yes, the Trump admin did what they could to hide and downplay revelations about Russian interference. But plenty was known. Some from govt reports and releases, some from more professional reporting which might have also been based on leaks, except that those outlets didn't burn their sources and get them arrested and imprisoned.",

It seems obvious that he showed them to people, and if some are missing they\u2019re more than likely sold off, but without proof I feel like his lawyers will argue the DOJ can\u2019t prove his leaked classified docs to the public. Kind of like no body, no crime. Hopefully I\u2019m just being pessimistic!

And when the first outbreak was detected on a cruise ship, ordered the ship docked on the West Coast, in San Diego and the infected shipped to the military base, in the heart of the city and the infected ferried back and forth to civilian hospitals, again in the heart of the city. More than likely hoping for a super spreader event to occurr. \n\nAdditionally, San Diego borders on Baja California, an international border, when Trump insisted on starting his \"build a wall\" BS and when visiting on live TV had to be corrected by a accompanying ranking military officer on disclosing remarks about the border security features that he was publically disclosing. Doubling down on the shitty design, the graft by Bannon, military contracts handed out without proper vetting or background checks on who or whom was working on the wall. It's not a hard stretch to come to your own conclusion on what was occurring. \n\nThen just to double down, Trump shut down the US so, someone's, somewhere, could get a good eyeful on the US defense strategy. \n\nIt should come as no surprise that the constant Republican rant about border invasion about illegals is propaganda BS. The ones being flown across state lines have already been processed and awaiting legal entry and relocation. \n\nAnd, it should not be taken with a grain of salt or downplayed for the Republican GOP or Trumps diehard adherents, that a lot of incidents or actions taken by Trump and his cronies was more of by design than random occurrences.",

You can look at the polls from around that time and watch HRC\u2019s numbers take a huge hit because of Comey.\n\nHRC was still a horrible candidate just based on likeability/approval/decades of slander against her, but the FBI is the reason Trump was ever POTUS to begin with.\n\nEdit: Jesus people I'm not saying Comey is THE reason HRC lost and I'm not saying HRC did nothing else wrong besides the email stuff. Comey sending that letter 11 days before the election erased HRC's margin and likely handed the election to Trump. \n\n\"The impact of Comey\u2019s letter is comparatively easy to quantify, by contrast. At a maximum, it might have shifted the race by 3 or 4 percentage points toward Donald Trump, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida to him, perhaps along with North Carolina and Arizona. At a minimum, its impact might have been only a percentage point or so. Still, because Clinton lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by less than 1 point, the letter was probably enough to change the outcome of the Electoral College.\"\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/",

This makes sense because we needed to reduce the friction of sharing info between different government organizations so that future 9/11\u2019s can be more easily prevented.

Everyone is just against him because he\u2019s such a genius and makes so much money.\n\nOne has to ignore 40+ years of documented illegal and downright shitty behavior to even entertain the possibility that he\u2019s a decent person. Note how his supporters never reference any good shit he\u2019s done because they can\u2019t.

Trump says the indictment is \u201cthe most horrible abuse of power\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d He should watch HBO\u2019s docudrama \u201cReality,\u201d which assiduously walks through the arrest by Trump\u2019s Justice Department of Reality Winner, the National Security Agency translator who leaked one classified document and was sentenced to more than five years in prison.\n\nWinner was a contractor who saw a classified NSA report detailing Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election via a cyberattack on a voting software supplier and phishing emails aimed at local election officials. She sent it to The Intercept, which made it public.\nAdvertisement\nFormer President Donald Trump waves after speaking at the Georgia Republican convention, Saturday, June 10, 2023, in Columbus, Ga.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore) (John Bazemore/AP)\n\nThe leak was a violation of the law, and for it, Winner paid a steep price. For exposing one secret document that gave the American people information it likely had a right to know, the Air Force vet \u2014 who pleaded guilty \u2014 got the longest sentence ever imposed for the unauthorized release of government information to the media. Speaking to the judge upon her sentencing, she took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the \u201cundeniable mistake\u201d and \u201cwould like to apologize profusely.\u201d (Winner was released from prison into home confinement in 2021.)\n\nWhat about Trump, who illegally retained 140 classified documents in his Florida residence and then obfuscated rather than cooperating with federal officials who wanted them back? The special counsel\u2019s evidence includes an audio recording in which Trump, speaking about a secret document in 2021, says \u201cAs president, I could have declassified it, but now I can\u2019t\u201d \u2014 a critical admission that he understood that what he was doing was unlawful.\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon Winner\u2019s sentencing in 2018, Trump tweeted that the punishment meted out was \u201cunfair\u201d and a \u201cdouble standard\u201d because it was \u201csmall potatoes\u201d \u201ccompared to what Hillary Clinton did,\u201d namely her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Those small potatoes have now been fried up and doused in ketchup by the former (and pray not future) president.\n\n    2023\n     \n    &gt; \n    June\n     \n    &gt; \n    11",

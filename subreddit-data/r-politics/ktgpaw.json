However, he needs to be in prison unable to communicate with American enemies.\n\nSimply *declaring* that he can't run again means nothing. What if he runs anyway? Or, declares that he won the 2020 race, then ends up supported by police unions and other similar organizations?\n\nDid the UK say it was illegal for Napoleon to rule France, or did they put him on one island, then realize that they made a huge mistake and needed to put him on island that was *much* farther away?",

Then they started talking about exiling him to somewhere in the Atlantic, although the Azores were their preferred destination.\n\nBasically: The Bourbons did everything they possibly could to provoke Napoleon into returning from his exile in Elba.",

As if Wednesday's insurrection was a nice, peaceful attempt to heal. \n\nDems need to start pushing against this narrative and start showing some courage. The GOP is shrivelling up by the day and will be rudderless on Jan 21. You can't convince any Trump supporters to vote for a centrist. That battle is lost. But we can still move past this while also holding people accountable for their actions.",

But, fuck that too, the America you remember was a facade. The pain and suffering and anguish we have seen in Ferguson, in Louisville, in Kenosha, etc. is what a lot of Americans have seen for their entire lives.\n\nIts time to do better.

We know that if the president does something far enough out of line, there are other branches of government that can hold him accountable. But, for the past four years, there's been none of that. And when the time came close a year ago, the Senate dropped the ball. \n\nTrump showing impunity has encouraged others to do the same, from senators to civilians. And even just an impeachment but without a removal sends a message. Not as strong a one as invoking the 25th, and Pence and the rest of Cabinet will need to be held responsible for abdicating on their responsibility in this instance.

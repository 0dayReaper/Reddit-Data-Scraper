Their own is the only moral one with everyone else being \"Baby killers\" etc. \n\nIt goes on and on and on, and when they start losing positions of power, and influence they will double, and triple down on outright insane bullshit... and ultimately outright violence as they view themselves as being the \"moral right\", and they do not view their targets as truly human at the end of the day and all.",

            "comment": "Here\u2019s the article highlights of just how bad these guys were:\n\n-At midnight before the tour, Patten texted Scannapieco, who is overseeing the redevelopment of the Providence building. \u201cPlease have fresh coffee (with milk and sugar) and the best croissant in Philadelphia ready for me upon arrival,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDirector Thorsen likes Diet Coke. Have a cold six pack waiting on the table in your conference room. You have three hours to convince us to give you $55M.\u201d\n\n-In the morning as the tour began, Patten commented on Scannapieco\u2019s appearance, asking her, \u201cLindsey, where is your husband? Why is he in Australia? Good thing you\u2019re married or I would move to Philadelphia.\u201d He also said, \u201cIf I knew your husband wasn\u2019t going to be here, I would have come last night.\u201d\n\n-During the tour, the group visited the Jefferson Wyss Wellness Center, a primary care hub for Philly\u2019s refugee and immigrant communities. Marc Altshuler, the center\u2019s clinical director and a professor at Jefferson, described his passion for helping marginalized populations, the email said. In response, Patten said, \u201cWhen you go to the bars at night, you must have to swat off the women.\u201d (Altshuler said \u201cNo, I am happily married.\u201d) Patten then asked Altshuler, \u201cYou\u2019ve got some ethnicity in you?\u201d The doctor said no. Patten asked if he was Italian. The doctor said no. Finally, after more questioning, Altshuler said he was Jewish. \u201cMazel tov,\u201d Patten said.\n\n-The group visited the headquarters for Diadora, the Italian sportswear and sneaker company, where an employee offered Patten a pair of sneakers. \u201cAre these made in China?\u201d Patten asked. \u201cI hope not, because I really hate China.\u201d He then turned to an Asian American female staffer in the room and said, \u201cNo offense, hun.\u201d\nIrwin\u2019s, one of the best restaurants in Philly, is only open for dinner. During the tour, Patten and Thorsen said they wanted to eat lunch there. When Scannapieco told them the restaurant was not open, they said, \u201cWell you can call in a favor if you want $55M in funding.\u201d Scannapieco said she organized a private lunch for them, which she had never done before.\n\n-Irwin\u2019s is located on the top floor of the Bok in a former nursing classroom, with walls still tagged with graffiti. It offers an extraordinary view of South Philly. In a memo a few days after the trip, Patten wrote that the restaurant looked like \u201cit was vandalized just before our arrival,\u201d according to WPRI. \u201cImagine my surprise when I learned that Bon Appetit magazine rated it one of the top ten restaurants in the United States!\u201d He added, \u201cThe cuisine at Irwin\u2019s did not disappoint. The word \u2018understated\u2019 comes to mind.\u201d\n\n-Patten requested items, ranging from vegan cheese to handblown glass to sneakers, from almost every tenant he visited. At each stop he said to Thorsen, \u201cI don\u2019t have to declare this, right?\u201d and Thorsen replied, \u201cIt\u2019s de minimis\u201d \u2014 State House shorthand for when a gift is low-enough in value that it doesn\u2019t violate ethics rules, according to WPRI.",

The guy might be evil/failed elsewhere, but there he had the right idea. The cost fiscally and ethically is to high to eject a bunch of people.",

The amnesty you mentioned passed as part of the bill you claim never happened:\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/1200\n\nThe bill was gutted by Republicans in committee to remove punishment for employers, which means the source of the issue, the reason immigrants cross the border, was left in place. Places like Swanson chicken lobbied to make sure they couldn't get in trouble for hiring undocumented workers. \n\nIf you're going to post a comment about this stuff, at least get your facts straight...\n\nedit: more info\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128303672",

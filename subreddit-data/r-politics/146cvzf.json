Though getting him there might be tricky - while states are required to extradite criminals between one another, arresting him while he's protected by the Secret Service might be very difficult, and Washington DC is not bound by the same extradition requirements as the states, with lots more scope for Congress and/or the Executive Branch to interfere.",

The constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly provide for this (probably because the founders didn\u2019t care about the position :P), but it\u2019s clear that they wanted a separate person to preside over impeachment trials than the person who will immediately benefit from having the president removed. There\u2019s a term for this \u201cA person should not be a judge in his own case.\u201d As such, the president pro tempore would likely preside over an impeachment trial of the Vice President.\n\nSimilarly, what margin is needed for bill to pass each chamber? The constitution doesn\u2019t specify, not even for rules deciding what margin bills would pass by in the first place. The principle of majority rule, thought inherent to all legislative bodies at the time, applies to create the rule by which all business would be conducted in the legislature.\n\nThis is why Trump\u2019s legal team advised against a self-pardon, as it would constitute an automatic admission of guilt but would be very unlikely to pass scrutiny in the courts",

There are enough fascists in this country that what seems like a no-brainer would be contested to some degree.

There are more subtle ways to do it if he cares, but he probably doesn't.

It might annoy the Trump diehards, but it gives the Republicans a LOT of objective support for doing so.

On one hand, **nothing is stopping a president from pardoning him/herself**, on the other hand, it's such a sleezy move that Congress might retaliate. \n\nThis discusses that presidents have unlimited powers to issue pardons, except in cases of impeachment. \n \nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/01/the-supreme-court-and-the-presidents-pardon-power/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVq-Cihrr_AhXck2oFHUItD5oQFnoECAgQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qyvBNH0c5YSZmNkEhvwON\n\n\nThis discusses that pardoning oneself *might* be an impeachable offense.  \n\nhttps://www.cato.org/commentary/president-can-self-pardon-it-would-be-impeachable-offense#\n\n&gt; self-pardons may be possible, but suggest, among other reforms, that \"Congress should also make clear that a self-pardon is not allowed and cannot be the basis for immunity from federal criminal investigation.\" \n\nCongress needs to nail this down, because if Trump is reelected (and I sadly believe that's possible) he WILL pardon himself. With the House having a majority, this isn't likely to happen with *this* Congress, but it would be in the best interests of the country to firmly shut this potential avenue down.",

He wants a definite, for sure version of him getting pardoned.\n\nHe fucked around a lot the first time, but if he were to win a second time, he's not going to waste time. He's going to outright state he has every right to do anything he wants, no matter what it is and that it's been \"confirmed\" because of the whole \"it's impossible to indict a *sitting* President\" thing.\n\nGo #2 = absolute disaster.

Sure it would be taken to court, but I would argue that it would put the spotlight back on the Republicans behavior in a bad way. Afterall, the Republicans would be the ones who would be acting hysterically, faking outrage, and going on news shows to complain, which would instead have the opposite of the intended effect. It would actually call attention to their behavior and help to inform voters who aren\u2019t already aware that the Republicans are the ones who are neglecting to perform their job duties. And people in general don\u2019t like workers who refuse to work. That\u2019s bipartisan. The Republicans  can\u2019t make an argument about law and order because the hypocrisy would be public and obvious. Take the hit in court so you can put the public pressure on the Republicans. It\u2019s all Messaging. They will cave quicker than the court system will work.",

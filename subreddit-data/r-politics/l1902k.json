No booth or anything!  \n\nTrump's stupidity never ceases to amaze me.  A few thousand dollars is peanuts in a campaign, and the USA Freedom Kids brought media attention worth far more than that.  Instead, he stiffs them and turns good press into bad press!  \n\nAt the same time, the kids sing \"Negotiate from strength or you'll be crushed\" and they certainly were crushed.",

Any traffic entering the TFR without prior approval, or any aircraft deviating from ATC instructions will be intercepted by military aircraft.\n\nWhen a President takes a bus trip the FAA establishes a TFR over the bus, that moves so as to stay over the bus as he rolls along!\n\nWikipedia has a good article on TFRs.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Regulations#Temporary_flight_restrictions",

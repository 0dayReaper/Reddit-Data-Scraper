And you think, that sounds like a conspiracy theory. \n\nBut then you read stories like this, and you think, maybe not. Once again, Trump is going to skate, even though we saw the evidence of his crimes in those nice color photos. It's just fucking too much. What deal was worked out decades ago to let Donald Trump do whatever he wanted without fear of conviction?",

            "comment": "Here is the beginning of the story:  \n\n\nThe decision to prosecute Donald Trump in South Florida appears to be centered around keeping the case airtight and avoiding a potential retrial\u2014but it\u2019s also one that could cost the Department of Justice a conviction at all.  \n\n\nFor starters, the court district\u2019s supposedly \u201crandom\u201d assignment wheel placed the case in front of Judge Aileen M. Cannon, a Trump appointee who previously tried to derail this very investigation.  \n\n\nAnd at the tail end, prosecutors will inevitably face a stark reality when seeking 12 impartial jurors at a trial: Florida\u2019s increasingly right-wing politics. Florida\u2019s embrace of MAGA politics\u2014as well as its acceptance of Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 new brand of far-right authoritarianism\u2014could be a real problem for prosecutors trying to get a unanimous guilty verdict.  \n\n\nThe traditional view of Florida as a so-called \u201cpurple\u201d toss-up state is now a distant memory, as best evidenced by the scathing letter Miami\u2019s former mayor wrote when stepping down as the state\u2019s Democratic party leader last year, after Republicans completely eviscerated their opponents in the polls. The moderate battleground politics of Florida have been replaced by deep-red passion.  \n\n\nIn court\u2014where Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith will try to prove that Trump illegally kept classified documents and engaged in a coverup\u2014that means politics will be impossible to avoid, an especially daunting task in a forum where a single Trump-loyal juror can cause a mistrial.  \n\n\n\u201cMaybe there are better places in the country that love former President Trump more, but there can\u2019t be many,\u201d said Roland Sanchez-Medina, one of the state\u2019s top lawyers and past president of the Cuban American Bar Association. \u201cThe adoration in South Florida, and in particular Miami-Dade County, is something unique\u2014something I\u2019ve never witnessed with any other president. The adoration is, as the younger generation would say, extra.\u201d",

Like the LASD deputy gangs. That doesn't sound safe to me. These LASD gangs are alleged to have dealt **drugs, illegal firearms** and not only assaulted, raped and murdered citizens but they've assaulted other deputies that whistleblew.

They believed a standing army is always inevitably used to tyrannize the people. George Washington, career soldier, disagreed that the country could defend itself with only militia and was proven right not too long after. So they established a standing army and the 2nd became almost entirely vestigial until it became a culture war flashpoint.",

Granted, it\u2019s doubtful they would have unified all the states if slavery was going to be settled then.

There should be a rep every 30,000 people. We changed it and capped the house. It should be repealed. There should be closer to several thousand house seats, which would make lobbying and political fuckery much more difficult.",

They're a great read for anyone who wants to understand much of what the founders were thinking. Which is a great read in general - how often do people write out new rules for a new country, and then put out publications to convince the general population to get on board with their wacky new ideas?",

I agree to a certain extent. However, using that term or \"assault weapons\" leaves the door open to ban anything that looks scary (which we've already seen with certain accessories). \n\nThat isn't logical decision making. We have the means to quantify levels of danger. We lose support from people who would otherwise support things like background checks and waiting periods when we tack on things like \"assault weapons.\"",

Massachusetts has a list of weapons that are banned because they *look like* guns that are banned. It's ridiculous. They offer no functional similarity to the actual banned assault rifles but you can't get a civilian semi-auto version of any banned weapon. The US has ~450 deaths a year from rifles. It is not a significant factor compared to the 13,600 from all firearms (aka handguns). We need a national background check system, waiting periods, and a unified licensing system.",

Just because Founding Fathers didn't see it coming(which they very much did expect technological growth in weaponry. Remember, they were alive at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution) doesn't make the amendment any less valid.

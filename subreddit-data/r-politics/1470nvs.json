My kids school switched to gender neutral bathrooms and locker rooms 5 years ago.  When they go on school overnights the default is gender neutral cabins.  All 3 of my kids have openly trans kids in their grade, as well as several otherwise LGBQ kids.  \n\nI took my son to the Timbers soccer game and there were pride, trans pride, and whatnot flags everywhere to go with a big banner reading \"No Transphobia On Our Turf!\" (we were playing Dallas).  \n\nMy kids in Middle School have gender and sexuality included in their health curriculum.  They also have queer inclusive books and openly non-binary and gay teachers.\n\nAll the bathrooms starting in 4th grade have period products in them and 4th grade is the year the health curriculum talks about menstruating.  (I was shocked when Florida banned talking about periods in school).\n\nMy kids do mixed gender slumber parties and only lightly consider gender in friendships.  All 3 have multiple platonic friendships with those of different genders from themselves.\n\n--- \n\nHonestly, I can't fathom how Oregon and Florida are in the same country.",

But also, there are some real unsexy things that happened under Pritzker that are pretty big deals.  Hair discrimination is now illegal, and certain state-funded institutions are required to supply menstrual products in bathrooms.  We recently banned book bans.\n\nThe other day, I heard some guy talk about moving to Florida \"to get away from Pritzker\" and I just had to chuckle.  He's not getting away from Pritzker, he's getting away from a state that embraces and celebrates diversity so he can go to a regressive state and be mad that trans kids exist.",

So their base will be decimated in the future, and immigrants don't want to work for them if they past Florida style laws.

On the other side of things, the most reliable right wing voters are baby boomers and they're dying off.  That's being accelerated by the fact that republicans are still ignoring covid and frequently unvaccinated; besides age killing them, covid is pushing them along.    \n\n\nIn another 20 years, a lot of the most conservative Americans will be dead, replaced by an extremely progressive generation.  My only fear is that republicans will do away with democracy altogether between now and then.",

Then again, they continue to think the GOP cares about them while their roads are crumbling, their healthcare goes up, wages stay stagnant, and all of the other amazing things that Republicans have consistently been against improving so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked.\n\nOur politicians,  well most of them, and their overlords know what they've done and that it's going to keep getting worse. So the oligarchs don't really need to think that much ahead because it's all about higher profits before societies collapse. They already have their old missile silo bunkers retrofitted for the future they know is coming so who cares about the birth rate amongst their lemmings? They will either be personally dead in 50 years or won't have a populace to get rich off of. \n\nAbsolute human scum and even though I don't believe in hell, I really fucking hope most of these people end up there.",

Before someone tries to shit on my home state, California is doing fine, the 'exodus' is highly exaggerated, and most people are leaving due to cost-of-living, not because the governor and legislature are hostile towards a particular group. \n\nDo what you have to for your family, you owe the state nothing.

Most drag queens do not identify as women outside of their costume/persona. Being transgender/transitioning is about creating an external gender expression (e.g. clothing, hairstyle, pronouns, body shape/proportions) that matches your internal identity. It is not a costume or performance, it is a daily experience and meant to be congrous and taken seriously in conjunction with the rest of their identity. Some people go all-out in crafting their gender expression (e.g. meticulous outfits and makeup, hormones, body modification/surgery), while some people throw on a graphic tee or a skirt and call it a day. Note that a specific gender identity is not required to be transgender, many non-binary and/or gender fluid people also consider themselves to be trans.",

She had expressed that she was a girl from an early age and guided her parents through her gender journey \u2013 asking to wear dresses, change her name, and to be referred to as a \u201cdaughter\u201d by her parents.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\u201cWhen she was 3, one day, she told me, \u2018I'm a girl person,\u2019\u201d Susan said in an interview with ABC News.

How can ANYONE read this article and think \u201cyeah, this is a *prime* example of an abusive family forcing the \u201cwrong\u201d gender onto their child\u201d? More like a state government demanding that everyone ascribe to THEIR ideas about gender **or else**. And a child feeling like she has to endure abuse to protect her family from complete upheaval.",

Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, the bill\u2019s sponsor, called back to more than 50 years of activism and invoked the names of countless activists \u201cwho devoted their lives to this movement and did not live to see this day.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cPeople have not been able to keep jobs. They\u2019ve not been able to keep housing. They\u2019ve been put out of places and this seeks justice for the people suffering now, but it definitely is a signal to those people that their lives were not lived in vain. So many people lived in the shadows, so many people were beaten and bruised just because of their identity,\u201d Moss, Michigan\u2019s first openly gay senator, said after the signing. \u201cI feel like today is an attempt to write those wrongs and to recognize their importance to the state of Michigan.\u201d\n\n&gt; The signing was heralded as a historic advancement in civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Michiganders by activists and policymakers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the Democratic legislative majorities even as she worked to maintain her composure in a venue that was filled with emotion.\n\n&gt; \u201cTheir tears of happiness are coming down, I\u2019m trying to hold it together \u2014 can\u2019t look at them too much,\u201d she joked.\n\nCome to Michigan and live your lives in freedom and equality! No big brother GOP state government fascists threatening you or your children! \n\nLet the great red state brain drain begin in earnest!",

My kids school switched to gender neutral bathrooms and locker rooms 5 years ago.  When they go on school overnights the default is gender neutral cabins.  All 3 of my kids have openly trans kids in their grade, as well as several otherwise LGBQ kids.  \n\nI took my son to the Timbers soccer game and there were pride, trans pride, and whatnot flags everywhere to go with a big banner reading \"No Transphobia On Our Turf!\" (we were playing Dallas).  \n\nMy kids in Middle School have gender and sexuality included in their health curriculum.  They also have queer inclusive books and openly non-binary and gay teachers.\n\nAll the bathrooms starting in 4th grade have period products in them and 4th grade is the year the health curriculum talks about menstruating.  (I was shocked when Florida banned talking about periods in school).\n\nMy kids do mixed gender slumber parties and only lightly consider gender in friendships.  All 3 have multiple platonic friendships with those of different genders from themselves.\n\n--- \n\nHonestly, I can't fathom how Oregon and Florida are in the same country.",

But also, there are some real unsexy things that happened under Pritzker that are pretty big deals.  Hair discrimination is now illegal, and certain state-funded institutions are required to supply menstrual products in bathrooms.  We recently banned book bans.\n\nThe other day, I heard some guy talk about moving to Florida \"to get away from Pritzker\" and I just had to chuckle.  He's not getting away from Pritzker, he's getting away from a state that embraces and celebrates diversity so he can go to a regressive state and be mad that trans kids exist.",

The loss of abortion will increase that. The shortage of doctors and the distance you have to travel in rural areas to reach a doctor will also contribute to the deaths of conservatives. The population of your state affects your funding from the feds, and I believe the allocation of electoral votes is based on the census. So their base will be decimated in the future, and immigrants don't want to work for them if they past Florida style laws.

Then again, they continue to think the GOP cares about them while their roads are crumbling, their healthcare goes up, wages stay stagnant, and all of the other amazing things that Republicans have consistently been against improving so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked.\n\nOur politicians,  well most of them, and their overlords know what they've done and that it's going to keep getting worse. So the oligarchs don't really need to think that much ahead because it's all about higher profits before societies collapse. They already have their old missile silo bunkers retrofitted for the future they know is coming so who cares about the birth rate amongst their lemmings? They will either be personally dead in 50 years or won't have a populace to get rich off of. \n\nAbsolute human scum and even though I don't believe in hell, I really fucking hope most of these people end up there.",

Being transgender/transitioning is about creating an external gender expression (e.g. clothing, hairstyle, pronouns, body shape/proportions) that matches your internal identity. It is not a costume or performance, it is a daily experience and meant to be congrous and taken seriously in conjunction with the rest of their identity. Some people go all-out in crafting their gender expression (e.g. meticulous outfits and makeup, hormones, body modification/surgery), while some people throw on a graphic tee or a skirt and call it a day. Note that a specific gender identity is not required to be transgender, many non-binary and/or gender fluid people also consider themselves to be trans.",

A modern day holocaust of the trans and LGBTQ+ community is not hyperbole or a \"maybe\", it is the inevitable conclusion of the GOP's current trajectory should they be allowed to continue and amass more power (such as retaking the federal government).\n\nAnyone who supports Republicans at this stage is supporting this genocide, no matter what their garbage excuse is for \"oh I don't support THAT but I support their fiscal policy\" or whatever horrors let these people sleep at night.\n\nRepublicans are fascists and they want the trans community exterminated.

So many people lived in the shadows, so many people were beaten and bruised just because of their identity,\u201d Moss, Michigan\u2019s first openly gay senator, said after the signing. \u201cI feel like today is an attempt to write those wrongs and to recognize their importance to the state of Michigan.\u201d\n\n&gt; The signing was heralded as a historic advancement in civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Michiganders by activists and policymakers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the Democratic legislative majorities even as she worked to maintain her composure in a venue that was filled with emotion.\n\n&gt; \u201cTheir tears of happiness are coming down, I\u2019m trying to hold it together \u2014 can\u2019t look at them too much,\u201d she joked.\n\nCome to Michigan and live your lives in freedom and equality!

We and Rainbow Passage have tried to contact A Place For Marsha but no response yet. If I were you, I\u2019d primarily send people needing help to Rainbow Passage (they\u2019re currently better prepared for it) and send more of the people WANTING to help to Yellow Brick Road so we can get our infrastructure solid and start helping too.\n\nAlso. YBR\u2019s approach is much quieter than Rainbow Passage. We are more underground and spread via word-of-mouth, and we want to keep it that way as much as possible. We\u2019d rather not have our info in large-traffic areas of the internet like Twitter and such. I only post about it when I think the chance of positive engagement is high and the chance of negative engagement is comparatively low.",

Gun control is not nearly as settled by only someone who is ignorant would think that everything is perfectly fine when school shootings and other acts of violence involving guns are extremely common in America.",

Literally, Alito &amp; Clarence Thomas said that they wanted to remove Obergefell vs Hodges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*The Supreme Court, Thomas continued, forced same-sex marriage \u201cupon society through its creation of atextual constitutional rights,\u201d which enabled \u201ccourts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe that marriage is between one man and one woman as bigots.\u201d In Davis\u2019 case, \u201cObergefell was read to suggest that being a public official with traditional Christian values was legally tantamount to invidious discrimination toward homosexuals.\u201d Thomas concluded, \u201cBy choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the Court has created a problem that only it can fix.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/supreme-court-ready-to-overturn-obergefell.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/supreme-court-ready-to-overturn-obergefell.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why codifying the Respect for Marriage Act is incredibly vital.

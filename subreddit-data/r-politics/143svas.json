She didnt need to spend time talking to me or even acknowledging me because I was a kid and she was a grown ass woman. \n\nBut she did.\n\nShe made me feel like she genuinely cared about what I had to say.\n\nIve always thought she would have made a great political leader, but my parents said she had gone through a horrible divorce and there were things that went public that made her unable to be elected. I dont know what those things were, but I have a feeling they would be considered quaint by today\u2019s standards.",

Prior to that time, members of Congress received practically no financial support from outside their own district or state, but LBJ raised unprecedented amounts of money from a group of rich Texas businessmen and spread it to Democrats around the country. It can literally be stated that many of the Democrats who would win the majority owed their elections to LBJ. His financial connections and campaign finance infrastructure allowed him to exert control over Democratic elections for the rest of his political career, and many Democrats knew he could use that influence to end their careers if they crossed him.\n\nIn contrast, since that time campaign finance reforms have limited to amount of funds that the parties can raise and give to their candidates while the Citizens United decision has eradicated any limits on the amount of money individual donors can spend influencing elections. A current President like Biden could never wield anything close to the kind of financial influence that LBJ had at his disposal.",

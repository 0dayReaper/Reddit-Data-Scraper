Whowuddathunk?\n\nEven their messaging overlaps with the other... \"pro-life\" bullshit as an example has nothing to do with actual lives in play, and is all about low brow effort to promote virtue of self while dehumanizing others so as to enable abuse, and violence towards them. \n\nProof of that is easily attained simply by looking at not only the general behavior of those individuals, and groups that promote such, but their other beliefs, and positions on policy etc. they tend to be against everything that would ultimately help with saving lives of mothers, and children, and what could help both in life. To a point where it is obvious that those \"pro-life\" could not care at all if a mother and child were to die in a ditch sick, cold, and in pain at any point in time during, or after pregnancy as long as a birth occurred, and that someone they deem their lesser, or \"moral inferior\" was made to suffer in the process. \n\nYou know, they are usually against all of the little things like free healthcare, programs that promote access to pre-, and post-natal care resources... they are against programs that would help new mothers cope with realities of parenthood, and other things like free school meals that directly benefit children of parents of lesser means during critical developmental years.",

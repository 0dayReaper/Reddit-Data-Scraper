And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each;* ***which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States,*** *directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted.* (Article II, Section 1, Clause 3)\n\nThese \"fake electors\" had to sign (identifying themselves) and certify (therefore committing fraud) what they were doing. Also IIRC the real &amp; authentic electoral certificates have the State seal and are signed by State officials (i.e. the State governor or the Secretary of State) which make them harder to forge.",

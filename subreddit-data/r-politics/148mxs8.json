McDonald had testified before the Jan. 6 Select Committee, where he invoked his Fifth Amendment right more than 200 times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both McDonald and DeGraffenreid served as so-called fake electors, slates of electors who in most cases signed certification documents purporting that Trump had won in their states even though he had lost.",

Anything you say that they can't accept because it disrupts the carefully maintained ecosystem of bullshit they've built around themselves will be immediately disregarded.  No, it doesn't matter how much proof you have.  \n\nI once pointed out to her two absolutely contradictory things that she brought up in the same conversation.  Literally one could not be true if the other was true.  Her response was to still believe both and say she was so sad that I had been brainwashed.\n\nThat's when I realized that objective reality doesn't really matter to her or many others.  Literally everything comes down to how believing certain things make her feel.  This stuff makes her feel good to believe, and my stuff makes her not feel good, so my stuff is wrong.",

He was coming to his senses. I heard logical things, empathetic things, declarations that Trump needs to fuck off so the country can heal! I thought it was going to be OK.\n\nThen he gets indicted and I hear \"I don't think we should talk about that!\" Wow, dad was mad. He brought up Clinton, and Biden, and a bunch of shit I had never heard before. I said, \"whatever crimes Clinton or Biden may or may not have committed, they do not absolve Trump of committing crimes. One set of laws for all. How does one forgive the other?\"\n\nWell I didn't say that!\n\nOK, so why bring up Clinton and Biden at all?\n\nBecause the justice system has become so biased! Deep state is real! \n\nRight, but, well, huh?\n\nIf we don't get a handle on this, who knows what will happen to this country?\n\nWhat do you mean when you say that? What do you imagine that doomed world to look like?\n\nWell, um, the people won't trust their government.\n\nWe already don't trust our government. \n\nYes, but more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just breaks my heart. The grip the batship insanity of Trump world has on what are otherwise rational, good people is an evil fucking force. I don't understand it.",

So, I try not to be too harsh towards those who have fallen in.\n\nBut, I started to fall for it when I was around 18/19 and just started getting into politics, so I was pretty na\u00efve and ignorant. This was also during a period where Republican politicians at least pretended to have morals and were seemingly more moderate, at least compared to the Republicans we have in office today. \n\nI think a big part of my falling for their bullshit was due to the fact I didn\u2019t realize the \u201cnews\u201d could just straight up lie and misrepresent the facts. I knew there were inherent and oftentimes explicit biases, but some of the things I heard just weren\u2019t true at all.\n\nThere\u2019s two incidents that I remember that allowed me to come back to reality. The first one that started the alarm bells going off was when these \u201cnews\u201d sources were saying hotels should be allowed to price gouge during natural disasters, which made me do a double-take, and then the second instance, the \u201cnews\u201d tried to push a ridiculous conspiracy theory narrative that honestly made me laugh out loud and say, \u201cOkay, this is some of the stupidest shit I\u2019ve ever heard. Why do I trust these people?\u201d I also had friends who called me out on my dumbass takes during that time, which I think helped as well.",

Just be careful when you do.\n\nIf you come across as arrogant or like you think you\u2019re smarter or better than them, or if they feel like you\u2019re calling them stupid, then they might end up digging in further in response, as they might not want you to get an, \u201cI told you so\u201d type moment that justifies your arrogance or seemingly proves their imagined stupidity when/if they ever change their positions.\n\nAlso, make sure you stay calm. If you come across like you\u2019re heated, upset, or emotional, then they\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve just fallen for propaganda on the other side, which will cause them to feel like both sides are similarly propagandizing their voters.\n\nAnd finally, and the most important, make sure they feel like you still love them. My friends made sure to call my *positions* stupid, but they did it in a way where I didn\u2019t feel personally attacked. The most effective was when they wouldn\u2019t even explain why it was stupid, that made me think about why my friends thought it was stupid, which forced me to think more critically. But, in the end, I knew they still loved me and respected me, and I knew they didn\u2019t necessarily think *I* was stupid. This might have been easier for my friends to do since politics and my stances were fairly recent additions to my life, so I hadn\u2019t combined them with my personality or who I felt like I was as a person. Some people, who have held their beliefs a long time, may feel like you\u2019re personally attacking their character if you call them out on certain subjects or call them out in a certain way.\n\nIt\u2019s a very difficult balancing act, and it might very well be impossible for some, but I have to believe everyone can come back to reality like I did.",

            "comment": "I have been working on this for DAYS. Not just on reddit (but certainly here a lot), but elsewhere.\n\nThey really, really do not want to know anything about this. They don't. It's not even conscious, I don't think--though some are aware of the avoidance.\n\nThe number of times I or others have asked \"have you read the indictment?\" or suggested \"you should read the indictment\" or identified something they said that's materially just incorrect and suggested \"the answer is in the indictment\" is almost silly now.  It's the mantra of this chapter of the story... we're in the \"Plead With Them To READ the Damn Indictment\" phase.\n\n* \"Trump declassified everything!!!!!\" - the statutes he's alleged to have broken have nothing to do with that, did you read the indictment? You should read the actual indictment where the actual crimes are outlined because you simply are arguing for something that isn't part of this.\n* \"They were almost all process crimes, whatever\" - they weren't, 31/37 are very much proper crimes. You should read the indictment.\n* \"Trump was working with the FBI the whole way, it's just no reason to have raided him, etc.\" - did you read the indictment? It covers the timeline very, very clearly about the acts that were obstructive and the evidence for why we know. They weren't working together, it was adversarial. Read the indictment.\n* \"There is no evidence...\" - read the indictment.\n* \"Biden did the same thing!!\" - did he? The crime Trump is alleged to have broken isn't the same as anything Biden is alleged to have done. Did. You. Read. For. Pete's. Sake. The. Indictment.\n\nFor neither love, nor for money, will a stubborn crust of them make themselves aware of the actual case, issue, and story happening right now. Won't. Refuse. They will have opinions and offer their objections and then retreat into \"I don't care about the indictment, don't have time to read it, I'll just wait for the trial because we ain't even know anything yet\" and not see the glaring problem with then forcefully insisting on mitigating information while choosing, purposefully, to be ignorant about the substance.\n\nI think on some level, they know. They know this is that bad. And that if they read it, they'll find the talking points they have sound dumb and uninformed. But by not? They can just continue to repeat them.\n\nI'm not even suggesting they AGREE with the indictment. I've asked so many times \"well, then what narrative, that takes the evidence in the indictment into account and explains it, or argument is there that would be reasonable to a jury of citizens?\"  Only two answers come back:\n\n1. More gish galloping or deflection to talking points that are--again and again and again--simply not part of this indictment and won't be part of the court case. The bias of the DoJ isn't going to make the documents not NDI. Clinton's emails won't change the notes from Trump Lawyer 1 about obstructive acts. Biden's corvette will have no bearing on Nauta moving things and hiding them. Etc.\n2. Crickets.\n\nI've been chatting with and arguing with right wing folk of all stripes for ages (it's probably my second favorite personal hobby, decades of it). I've been through these dense patches of wilful ignorance on many subjects.\n\nTHIS is the cleanest, most recent, and one of the most stubborn examples I've ever seen.\n\nAnd it never lasts. It just never lasts. Reality here will just happen, no ostrich heading in the sand stops that. It could all be the most politically motivated investigation in US history, but that will not change the evidence. The case will happen. That indictment is a full roadmap of the exact argument, evidence, testimony, and charges that Jack Smith is going to do in that trial. THAT is the trial right there.\n\nIt will happen. A jury of citizens will sit there and Jack Smith will tell them and show them everything in that indictment. Clean. Clear. Cited. Testified. Mr. Trump will HAVE to figure out a defense that acknowledges the basic facts (the photos, the recordings, the documents, their NDI, the statutes, the obstructive acts, the lawyer's notes, the testimonies) and interpret them differently enough that he is not culpable.\n\nWhatever THAT story is--the one that takes the facts from the indictment and makes a better story of them--is a complete mystery to anyone. Everyone.  He can deny the evidence is real or that the testimony is honest, he can say anything more or less (short of perjury, which will neuter many of his most desired explanations), and it will have to be more credible and convincing than what we have on the page in that indictment.\n\nAnd they will have to reckon with that. It's going to happen.\n\nAnd they--also--just like everyone else?  They have no explanation for what's on that page that isn't so far fetched and crazy sounding to the average citizen that when compared to Smith's whole breakdown and evidence? It strains credulity to breaking that Mr. Trump is likely to be more credible.\n\nBut, in the spirit of fairness, I'm happy to hear that story and think about its credibility.\n\nBut they won't provide it. It's easier to whine about Clinton and Biden and bias and classification powers of a President and repeat the man's lies about the PRA and whatnot then have to address the indictment's actual text. They're preparing for a PR war of words, not a court case, and it won't be a PR war in the courtroom. It'll be a court case.",

So perhaps Trump voters understood that factual fidelity was not what they were getting from him, and didn\u2019t feel upset to learn he wasn\u2019t telling the whole truth.\n\n&gt;This dovetails with what I heard from Trump voters during the campaign. Frequently, they\u2019d say they wished Trump would choose his words more carefully, exaggerate less, or back away from his more radical policy positions. Ultimately, though, their support was based on image and tribal identity. They felt that Trump was speaking bluntly and fighting for them in a way other politicians did not. Salena Zito made a similar observation in The Atlantic, from which this new paper adapts its title.\n\nThis analysis offers some useful insights, but the game has changed since 2017, and MAGAs give every appearance of having hardened their attitude after marinating in Trump's transgressive venom for six years.",

So, he probably thinks he can get the government to settle, pay people off, and generally make it go away.\n\nIt probably hasn't occurred to him, or quite sunk in, that these are national security charges in Federal court. He can try to outlast the government, but I suspect the DOJ will make that excruciatingly difficult. He can try and tie up the process with bullshit and appeals, but it's doubtful that lasts forever or even works.\n\nIf the DOJ is indicting, they have him dead to rights. Zero wiggle room, and no appeals are going to get him out of it.\n\nI think it's not so much him being numb, but rather him not understanding the gravity of the situation.",

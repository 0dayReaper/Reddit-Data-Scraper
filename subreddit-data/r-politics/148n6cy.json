They're whatabouting this to death but can't seem to understand the nuance involved and that both cases don't equate. \n\nThere's still the Georgia case and January 6th too. What's crazy is that the more crimes Trump's indicted for, the more his most ardent supporters latch onto the persecution/witch hunt narrative. Trump plays the victim and his supporters vicariously become victims too. \n\nYou'd think that the more someone is held accountable for their crimes, the worse their reputation becomes, but with Trump's supporters, it's the opposite. It's fucking mad.\n\nI mean, conservatives tend to conflate persecution and holding people accountable who have traditionally evaded accountability, it's delusional. Similarly, a more equitable society is the equivalent of oppression to them. This is how entitled, ignorant, jingoists think.\n\nI mean for fuck's sake, if Joe Biden were guilty of 1/10th of the wrongdoing that Trump is being indicted for, they'd be running impeachment hearings as we speak and Biden would be the target of a relentless hate campaign even more extreme than what we're seeing now.\n\nWhen it's *their* guy, conservatives go to great lengths to defend, downplay and rationalize wrongdoing, but when it's the enemy, they jump to extreme and partisan conclusions, often times without any evidence, indiscriminately believing any piece of propaganda, so long as it validates their fragile worldview and their presumptions.",

I am overjoyed to see all of you here tonight - supporters, patriots, friends. We've assembled a fantastic, unprecedented crowd, haven't we?\n&gt; \n&gt; You know, there\u2019s an interesting record out there \u2013 maybe you've heard about it. A record set for a president being arrested. Well, folks, we've exceeded that. We've doubled it. We now stand at two. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, some folks, they'd take a look at that and say, \"Oh, that's a bad thing.\" But no, not us. We've always been about conquering records, about challenging the status quo, about making history. And here we are, doing just that.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the numbers, oh, the numbers are quite something. I've got 71 charges to my name. That's a huge figure, isn't it? But let's be clear, numbers are just numbers. They say I'm the president who has been charged the most \u2013 and they're not wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Understand this, we've created history together, and regardless of the number of charges they put before us, we will keep confronting them. We will keep moving ahead. Because, as I've always maintained, this journey is about you \u2013 the good folks of America. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let's continue to tackle these records, let's keep confronting our challenges, let's keep scripting history. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!\n\nchatgpt is amazing",

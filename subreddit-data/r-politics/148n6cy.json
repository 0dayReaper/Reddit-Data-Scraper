They're whatabouting this to death but can't seem to understand the nuance involved and that both cases don't equate. \n\nThere's still the Georgia case and January 6th too. What's crazy is that the more crimes Trump's indicted for, the more his most ardent supporters latch onto the persecution/witch hunt narrative. Trump plays the victim and his supporters vicariously become victims too. \n\nYou'd think that the more someone is held accountable for their crimes, the worse their reputation becomes, but with Trump's supporters, it's the opposite. It's fucking mad.\n\nI mean, conservatives tend to conflate persecution and holding people accountable who have traditionally evaded accountability, it's delusional. Similarly, a more equitable society is the equivalent of oppression to them. This is how entitled, ignorant, jingoists think.\n\nI mean for fuck's sake, if Joe Biden were guilty of 1/10th of the wrongdoing that Trump is being indicted for, they'd be running impeachment hearings as we speak and Biden would be the target of a relentless hate campaign even more extreme than what we're seeing now.\n\nWhen it's *their* guy, conservatives go to great lengths to defend, downplay and rationalize wrongdoing, but when it's the enemy, they jump to extreme and partisan conclusions, often times without any evidence, indiscriminately believing any piece of propaganda, so long as it validates their fragile worldview and their presumptions.",

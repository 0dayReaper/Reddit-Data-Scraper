Idaho had to transfer patients 6300 times just between August and November of 2021, with 1 in 3 of those patients winding up in Eastern WA. (Not that Eastern WA is a progressive paradise, just that it's not by any means Idaho). It should be noted that their rural healthcare hasn't gotten any better since, with many doctors afraid or unwilling to practice in a State with their extreme abortion laws in place (even banning out of state travel for minors aided by an adult).",

It's not as piddling or laughable as you might think:\n\n&gt; Christian Dominionism has the express purpose of instituting Christian theocracy in the US built on a social framework of Old Testament laws including racial segregation and defensive sequestration where undesirables are kept apart from the rest of society (camps) to protect society. \n\n&gt; The movement is behind guys like Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Ken Paxton and, to a lesser degree, Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott (they don\u2019t get full support since they\u2019re papists, and Christian Dominionism is ultimately just for Protestants). \n\n&gt; The movement is centralized and largely funded by the Green family, the people behind Hobby Lobby. They have a dark money organization called The Signatary that is **also responsible for the He Gets Us ads**. \n\n&gt; The Christian Dominionists are Dispensationalist extremists who have a doctrine of Apocalyptic Accelerationism. They believe in the End Times, the Antichrist, Rapture (Christians fly up to heaven) and a period of hell on Earth heralding the return of Jesus and the end of the world, and eradication of all sinners and it\u2019s all foretold in a prophecy.\n\n&gt; Meaning they believe they can *make* the prophecy come true if they fulfill all its conditions. They genuinely want to end the world and they want to save as many souls as possible from eternal damnation. Works done in the name of salvation can cross almost any line except worship of \u201cfalse idols\u201d and that includes killing and use of force to persuade conversion. Like the Spanish Conquistadors, but with more neckbeard and AR-15s.\n\n&gt; They\u2019re on the move. Be careful and be aware. They\u2019re very dangerous people.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/144zmqa/So,_uh,_someone_should_call_the_FBI_about_this,_right?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

They mow down waves of blue haired lesbians who don\u2019t know how to use a rifle, they endure a fun, safe level of hardship. Someone else maybe pays the ultimate price at an Alamo they aren\u2019t at, then maybe the military realizes they\u2019re right and comes sweeping in to put a nice bow on it all.\n\nThey never have to spend weeks on weeks digging trenches back and forth, only to get HIMAR\u2019d or drone grenaded when they\u2019re sleeping.  They never have to hear about entire towns worth of people they grew up with getting wiped out in a failed offensive.  They never get tried, walked to the gallows, and hung for being on the losing side.  \n\nIt\u2019s always a rocking good time, just as cool as it needed to be, full of adventure with a huge payout in glory.  \n\nThe American civil war is worth mentioning for sure, but that had some key nuances of its day that aren\u2019t going to be applicable now.  A second American civil war will be an animal of a type we haven\u2019t yet classified.  The one thing that\u2019s nearly certain is that basically every apparatus of state will not be on the side of the insurrectionists.  \n\nIt will be a confusing and bloody guerrilla campaign, for sure, but it won\u2019t be like the last one.  Decisive field battles will be rare if nonexistent. It will be the messiest counter-insurgency in history.  America has fought a number of insurgent wars in the recent past, and lost, because the stakes were low.  The stakes are national survival, this isn\u2019t an insurgency that 1 percent of America rotates through for 9 to 15 months and then calls it a day when it doesn\u2019t work out.",

He had the power to grant them pardons and instead he asked his friends in Congress to call them ANTIFA. There is a trail of convicts that have been created by his lawlessness and on that trail is his former lawyer who went to prison for what Trump for the crimes he has now been charged with in Manhattan and his CFO of his business and the Business itself have been charged with fraud and convicted. \n\nTLDR; He is likely a fraud and won\u2019t support you if you fail and even if he somehow becomes President he won\u2019t pardon you. He didn\u2019t Pardon Jan 6, his CFO, or his attorney. Don\u2019t find yourself on that trail, find a better candidate who isn\u2019t sloppy and lawless.",

Obviously, cases involving the President are usually civil, but judges rule on cases involving the President who appointed them all the time.  A judge in DC probably has at least one case involving the President who appointed them on their docket at all times until the President leaves office.\n\nAnd it's not just the President involved in judicial nominations.  The President might actually have the least to do with it.  There are many aides and lawyers in and out of the White House, Judiciary Committee staffers, personal staffers for the Senators on the Judiciary, etc. who source candidates and then shepherd nominees through the process.  Marco Rubio presented Cannon to the Trump administration.  Then there are the 57 Senators who voted to confirm Cannon.  Should federal judges recuse themselves from any cases involving any of these people?  And what about the 21 Senators who voted against and the staffers who worked against her?  \n\nAlso, I've never met a judge who felt like they owed their position to a President, or really anybody besides themselves.  They get their assignment and move on with their lives.  This feeling of gratitude and obsequiousness that people, including Trump, imagine judges have is just not a thing.  The world they come from is historical.  They spend their whole lives reading old opinions.  They care more about how their most obscure opinion will stand up to law students reading it in 50 years than they do the President and all of their rulings are going to satisfy their personal judicial philosophy.\n\nMaybe there would be more attention paid to the President and others if they had to ask for reappointment, but that's why the system isn't set up that way.",

Presidents just sign off on lists made by their aides and other peoples' aides.  If you're a lawyer in the White House, you could be working on a judge's confirmation in January and then writing a brief to be read by that judge in July.  You could be working on a judge's confirmation in January and then challenging a congressional subpoena for yourself in front of that judge in July.  A President's personal connection to a judge they appointed is tangential, not grounds for recusal.",

If you have 36 agents, and 33 of them give you the same story, it's easier to make the case that the three who are different are outliers for whatever reason. So it doesn't necessarily mean that each of these agents has some kind of significant testimony, it's just a way to show by aggregate what the most likely type of truth is. It's a really good strategy. Because there's no way that dozens of Secret Service agents are all going to lie about the same thing independent of each other.",

Usually it\u2019s something minor, and while technically classified, isn\u2019t something like nuclear secrets.\n\n-Biden had a few documents left over from his time as VP. When they were discovered, he immediately handed them over and fully cooperated with the investigation.\n\n-Mike Pence had the same issue as Biden. His attorneys immediately and fully cooperated and worked to ensure they did not have anymore documents.\n\nThe way Biden and pence did it is how it\u2019s supposed to be done.\n\nHere\u2019s how trump handled it:\n-purposefully took these documents, many of them at the highest classification level (no evidence Biden or pence docs were near this level)\n-lied about having them and strung along investigators\n-turned over some documents, refused to turn over others.\n-agreed to search for more documents, claimed he had no more. This lead to the FBI raiding mara lago\n-evidence of trump bragging about holding onto certain documents \n-evidence of trump attempting to obstruct and deceive investigators \n-evidence that trumps staff attempted to obstruct and hide documents from investigators\n-video evidence of trump staff moving boxes the day before FBI raid\n-Now we know there is a specific Iran document that they have on audio trump claiming to have\u2026 and yet trump has not handed it over. And it is currently missing.\n\nIf you think the trump situation is in any way comparable to the Biden situation, you are wholly and completely incorrect.\n\nThis is Justice being done, not political retribution. Despite what you may have read, trump cannot retroactively claim he \u201cdeclassified documents with his mind\u201d.",

So far it seems like Biden returned documents after being asked once. His lawyers took it seriously and responded earnestly. Trump had to be asked multiple times. And then Trump had to have a raid happen because he was lying about returning documents. And there is credible evidence he still retains classified documents. He isn\u2019t being forthcoming, which is the real problem now.\n\nAlso, it is not clear that a President can just wave their hand to declassify a document. It seems like a process exists and Trump did not follow it. If he had followed it then things may be different now. This is something Trump will be able to argue in court to get clarification on.",

Whether the documents were classified or not, government officials have a responsibility to return them to the Archives. While neither Biden nor Trump had post-presidency authority to declassify documents, the VP has similar declassification authority as POTUS. Biden's team found the documents and notified authorities, then - crucially - returned the documents (and searched for more). This is true for Pence as well. By contrast, Trump was notified that he had not returned documents, and he refused to return them. After several attempts to convince him to return the documents, the FBI was involved. At this point, Trump lied to the FBI (or had his team do so) about returning documents, searches, and other things.  There is evidence of intent on Trump's part, where there is none for Biden or Pence. Pence is also running for POTUS, opposing Biden, and he is not in legal hot water.",

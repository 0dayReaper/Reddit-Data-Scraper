I don\u2019t see her acting like she\u2019ll be impartial and then turning around and invoking Rule 29 once the Jury is empaneled, as some fear. She isn\u2019t smart enough for subtlety. And anyone with half a brain knew her ruling last year would be overturned but she still did it, so she\u2019s not smart enough to only make rulings that can\u2019t be overturned either. \n\nMark my words - the moment Cannon is able to do anything she will start doing everything she can to help Trump without thinking about how likely these things are to be overruled and barely trying to justify her behavior, just like she did before, making her bias clear from the get-go. This will make it easy for the prosecution to file a request to have her removed from the case.",

He has defied a lot of the pop culture image of what a masterful president should look like by applying insights obtained from an extremely long career as a legislator. As Mr. Biden is showing, his subdued style can produce potent results.   \n   \nHere! Here!\nI wish he, and the Democrats in general, would trumpet their policy successes because there have been several and in a difficult environment. Having Manchin and Sinema in the Senate did not guarantee a Democratic majority but he got through some damn tough legislation anyway. Kudos to him and I hope next year his campaign gets the message out about what he has accomplished.",

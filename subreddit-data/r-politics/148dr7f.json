They are nothing but a bunch of thugs and con-men/women.\n\nUnfortunately, there are enough people without the ability to think rationally and being prone to racial/sex/religious biases and emotions that can be manipulated by the Republican Party to gain power.\n\nThe only way to stop this bunch of lawless people is to keep voting them out power whenever the chance comes up. I will never vote Republican until I see them gone.",

But that was the turning point when the GOP realized they could no longer win elections on the issues, since their only actual policies are ones that help big business at the expense of literally everyone else: corporate tax breaks, deregulation, and union busting. That was the moment when they realized they had to distract people with culture war bullshit to win elections. That and an increasing dependency on tilting the playing field their favor through antidemocratic efforts like gerrymandering.",

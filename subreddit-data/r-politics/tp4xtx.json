That list only shows 4 members worth $100m or more and they are all Republican.  There are 12 Democrats on that list worth between $20m and $96m.  This post has had several responses accusing me of playing the party game and that was not my intention at all.\n\n2) I understand that this is a billionaire tax, but I can't see members of Congress that are worth tens of millions of dollars voting in favor of it.  Call it intuition.",

Rounding to 0.25 extra days/year, we get an extra day every 4 years. But it\u2019s actually only 0.96875 days/4 years.   \n   \nSince a year is an extra 0.242188 days/year, this creates an extra 24.2188 days/century. Skipping the century leap year, we would\u2019ve already added 24 leap days, creating an extra 0.2188 days/century.  After 400 years, that\u2019s an extra 0.8752 days, so we don\u2019t skip *that* century\u2019s leap year and the net error is a another over correction of 0.1248 days every 400 years. It would take 3,200 years to gain back 0.9984 of a day. As the year 3,200 is divisible by 400, it would be a leap year and since we over corrected, we\u2019d skip that leap year to be only +2.304 mins/3,200 years. \n  \nThis is assuming a perfect Solar year, without variance. There are other factors that create errors and variance where smart people figure out the corrections for us as we travel along. There was a significant correction that wiped 10 days off the calendar of numerous European countries during the mid 1500s when they first realized, just accounting for a leap year every 4 years wasn\u2019t enough. It creates an error of 3.12 days/year.",

It\u2019s unfathomable that a Chinese or Russian national could come to MAL for a party or golf event, and be using the bathroom which has documents concerning nuclear capabilities of other countries. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be alarmist but Trump if anything, gave our enemies the open opportunity to start WW3 by exposing our, and other countries deepest secrets regarding national security. People will disagree but you see how Russia invaded Ukraine? How China will invade Taiwan by 2024 probably?

There's him screaming about Dems selling national secrets, and he has a large habit of accusing people of things he's actively doing (see TrumpCriticizesTrump.) There's the enormous payments made to him and his family directly from foreign nations, like the $2,000,000,000 payment from Saudi Arabia.

Like, I am so sick of the whataboutism and inability for the general public to take in what is actually happening within our country right now. This man should not be receiving special treatment. Other people have had it a lot worse for doing a lot less.  \n\nIt is not \u201cdemocrat or republican\u201d at this point, it is just straight up *democracy* versus *fascism*.  \n\nThe fact that republicans are still defending this shit stain is actually astounding. There is no legitimate basis or reason for a defense against the charges brought against him. We all watched in real time the National Archives trying to get these documents for literally over a year, and they are rightfully government, classified property.  \n\nNow we know he actively worked to hide documents from not only the National Archives, but the DOJ\u2019s subpoena requesting all classified documents to be returned. He wanted them, and whatever the motive, he thought they were his to apparently brag about and discuss with people who did not have proper security clearance. In a way that showcased, he just can\u2019t help himself!! He\u2019s like a 5 year old with a playground secret.  \n\nThis should not be as politicized as it is. Full stop. This mother fucker had some of our country\u2019s most top secret info about our national defense as well as intel and information pertinent to our allies. If in the wrong hands, is a national security nightmare.  \n\nHe had information on potential weaknesses of our country against an attack AND how we would potentially respond. He kept this info haphazardly stored and located on a stage in a ballroom of his chintzy ass resort or potentially in a random bathroom, or located in the storage room to the pool which was more often than not LEFT OPEN. Let\u2019s also go back to the fact too that we know this was publicized in the media\u2026 everyone and their mother paying attention for months prior to the FBI search *knew* he was hiding more classified documents at Mar A Lago.  \n\nEveryone should be pissed off about his negligence. He isn\u2019t some saint to be praised and defended, he isn\u2019t a martyr. He is not being unfairly prosecuted or the victim of a political witch hunt.  \n\nThis dude reeks of corruption and criminal activity, and he just needs to literally be locked up and forgotten. The sooner, the better for this country. We need a fucking vaccination against Donald Trump.",

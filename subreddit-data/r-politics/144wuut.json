Only positive thing I can say about them is that a lot of them continued to bankroll non profits that benefited the Black community. Meanwhile their fiscal and labor policies sucked. \n\nWay back in the Coolidge administration they already figured out that low interest rates could fuel a consumption bubble that would get then reelected and damn the consequences but back then they weren't willing or able to save the banking sector post crash and American voters put them out in the cold for a generation, as they deserved. \n\n*Some* Black voters were already Democrats by Wilson's time even though Wilson himself was an extreme racist.

Like, that \"bombshell\" would have HELPED Obama in MANY negotiations and to think he would withhold it because it would make Bush \"look good\"? Have they seen Bush and Obama candidly? They got no beef at all between them. George Bush and Michelle are adorable together. They Obamas and Bushs clearly have a healthy relationship. https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/04/19/george-w-bush-michelle-obama-friendship-bush-shocked-over-uproar/7284054002/",

The document is Highly classified and kept inside a secure classified information facility. What does that mean?  \n\nThere is a very high probability that means the information contained in that document was gathered through one of the foreign intelligence agencies.  \n\nMy hunch is that this is more likely human intelligence than signals intelligence. \n\nAnd if we learned anything from the steele report, we should have all learned that human intelligence is a mishmash of good information, hearsay, and outright rumor and part of the problem is sorting the good stuff from the bad stuff. Intelligence agencies do a lot of work to assign confidence levels to little bits and pieces of information before they form conclusions.\n\n\nAgain, just a hunch,  but an allegation that a Ukrainian gas company had bribed Biden sounds exactly on brand for Russian misinformation. \n\nBecause they know that exactly this would happen.\n\nSo a Russian source tells an American agent that the Russians have proof that burisma bribed biden. The American agent writes it down into a memo and it gets transferred back to langley and shared with the fbi and an agent is tasked with investigating the allegation.   \n\nMeanwhile the Russians start rumors of bribery on twitter, there's a congressional investigation and there become a big deal about some secret document.  \n\nAnd now you have the desired chaos because the Republicans say, this is the most important thing ever why haven't you done anything with this. And the Democrats are saying hold on we don't even know where this came from or if it's real. It could be Russian misinformation. And the roles are switched from the Trump era",

Is it violent?, was someone harmed?, how likely is a win?  If the person committing the crime has money, then they can fight the charges to the point where the prosecution spend as much on that crime as they would to win cases against 4 to 10 other low to middle income people.  So they can chase every crime or just the ones they are likely to win and it\u2019s really easy to win against a public defender with 100 other cases.",

They seem to hold this belief that if they find dirt on \u201cour guy\u201d that we will balk and just let their guy go. No no, I can assure you, IF they found something on Joe or any, and I mean any Democrat, we will just put them in line behind your guy. We believe in equal justice. At least I think most Americans whatever their party affiliation. As such they would expect to see Joe and the rest of these asshats treated just as harshly. I now see the picture that people keep saying and I wish the conservatives among us could see it too. We are not that far apart in what we want out of our politicians and our justice system. Equal and fair treatment, only I feel as though we all have our blind spots for seeing the flaws in our own representation. The fact is those in power (and so many times it\u2019s not the people in front of the cameras) want to ensure we are fighting each other, boogeymen culture issues, and other countries. It\u2019s in their best interest to distract. Could Biden have taken a bribe? Absolutely. Should he and anyone associated be indicted and prosecuted? Again absolutely! But what ya gotta understand there Midge is that this won\u2019t get Donnie out of hot water. It\u2019s not a hostage negotiation. Your proof of Biden\u2019s guilt does not distract from Trump\u2019s. It merely goes to show you they are human. As human they need to be held to the standards of the justice system. If the justice system is unfair, maybe it needs to be changed. But I have yet to see any meaningful legislation from the Republicans to address the disparities between a poor man and rich man in the legal system. So don\u2019t come crying to me when man of power A is able to wrench down on man in power B. It\u2019s the system you perpetuate, maybe y\u2019all need to fix it so that any person brought before the justice system is treated as a person. Not black/white, not rich or poor, not influential or common, but as a person. But hey feel free to spout your BS about a top secret paper none of us will ever see. Or if released will either disprove your theory resulting in you and your ilk that it was changed since you saw it. Or it will show the bribe is true or could be, and you\u2019ll call for resignation and the detonation of the Biden administration. The justice system will balk at the idea of throwing out a duly elected president, as well as holding anyone but him accountable, which will get his Vice put into place. And on and on and on. This is a distraction, a one way road with no outlet.",

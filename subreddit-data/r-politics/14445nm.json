Because if you let them make a mistake and then take them off the board earlier in the game, they have less a chance to murder millions by staying in the game longer...\n\nEdit 2: people apparently DO want millions to die by letting the enemy get an advantage.\n\nEdit 3: trevita17 keeps harassing me saying I want to send people to their death while not realizing I want to SAVE millions with STRATEGIC PLACEMENT of thousands that were ALREADY GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR *THEY* ARE STARTING.",

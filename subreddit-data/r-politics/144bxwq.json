Trump is none of those things.\n3. Jublex is gelatinous, gross, stinky, and melts you by his mere disgusting touch. Trump is clearly the spawn of jublex.",

                            "comment": "And it's also a misunderstanding of what \"tough guy\" is, which is why it's often said that Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man. For example, when it comes to Biden no one envisions a \"tough guy\" persona, yet look how he's handled foreign policy, specifically with Russia. Putin himself may have bought into the hype that Biden was feeble and senile and wouldn't stand in his way. But he fucked around and found out. Now NATO is stronger and more united than ever against Russia, the sanctions against Russia have economically isolated it to almost North Korea levels, and Putin's military strategy has been reduced to committing war crimes and hoping Biden loses in 2024. That's some serious tough guy shit Biden pulled off, yet because Biden doesn't give speeches where he shouts and calls people names, he's not perceived as a tough guy. \n\nTo give an analogy, almost everyone has worked for a stereotypical loud and angry boss. The kind that shouts red-faced about every minor issue, never takes blame for his own failures but constantly demands credit for everyone else's work. To an outsider, that boss might seem like a \"tough guy\" but to everyone that's ever worked for one, you know it's actually an extremely poor leadership style and anything that gets accomplished happens *in spite* of that leadership, not because of it. Same is true for fake tough guys like Trump.",

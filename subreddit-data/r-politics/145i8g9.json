Trump getting convicted or found responsible in court, it doesn't matter because he always still ended up on top, meaning no one stopped him from doing the thing. The didn't is and the punishment wouldn't stop him from doing it again.\n\nHe said it in the second debate with Clinton. He admitted he has no morality. He was sued many times by individuals and states but no one stopped him. He said, \"you were in power. You were in power then. Why didn't you stop me?\" He has no morality. It is completely externalized and he can't tell the difference between right and wrong because that isn't decided when the action is committed. He still did it all you can do is say he was wrong, but if there is nothing stopping him from doing it again, literally stopping him, then he wasn't found to be wrong.",

Here's the docs.\"\n\nI still wouldn't personally have believed he managed to *accidentally* take that many classified documents, but it would have been the end of it for Trump. There would have been no more looking in to it, no more investigation, just half a news cycle about how much he took and was handed back and we all would have forgotten the next day. Shit, if he was smart he could have gone through all those documents ahead of time, taken pictures of them all, and handed them back and there wouldn't have been any accusation against him at all. \n\nHe could have even handed them over to Putin somehow and if/when they started to leak and it was revealed that they were the same documents that Trump gave back to the government, it would have actually been quite easy to just say, \"yeah, that's what I'm hearing. It is really unfortunate, but I honestly didn't know they were in there and since we didn't realize, it is possible that some of the people moving them could have had access. It is also possible that it is coincidental and the source is somewhere else as these obviously weren't the only copies of these documents. I absolutely encourage a thorough investigation of anyone who might have had access to the boxes before they reached my estate or anyone who may have breached Secret Service security here at Mar-a-Lago with the intent of espionage. I hope for the sake of our country that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\" Boom - now he's just some guy who fucked up on sorting boxes while moving like we all do and who is concerned about that oversight.\n\nHe has to run his fat mouth about everything and act like a petulant toddler when he doesn't get his way. I hope it is his undoing, and the undoing of the entire Trump legacy and the destruction of the wealth that his ilk have gained or will inherit.",

Certainly, President Joe Biden's Justice Department is politicized and weaponized.\n\nRight wing media is *still* unwilling to just be honest about what is going on, even when they've supposedly had enough of Trump. If the right wants to truly move on from Trump they just need to admit that the Democrats are not conducting a \"witch hunt\" and that all the criticisms and investigations and allegations against Trump are credible and legitimate and that they were wrong to have ever supported him. If even their media can't do it, then their voters never will, and that's why Trump is certain to win the GOP nomination and lose the 2024 election.",

Trump is the worst thing to happen with the monsters that have been masquerading as conservatives for 50 years because he brings all of the hateful shit they feed on to the forefront and shines a bright ass spotlight on it. He galvanizes sane, rational people against them because he shows us what their base really thinks.\n\nAnd its all their fault. They have spent decades feeding their base a steady stream of hate and vitriol and abject stupidity, all to whip up more support and garner more votes. But it finally reaches a critical mass and went critical, and now they've completely lost control of it. Look at how romney and mcconnell handle trump. They talk a big game, but then do absolutely fuck all about him. Because they know that he's sinking the ship but if they actually step in to stop him, they'll alienate the majority of their base.\n\nThey're fucked, and it's their own damn fault. And good, because fuck them.",

It was there when people were protesting school immigration as communism. It was there when a nazi rally was held in Madison Square Gardens. It was there when Martin Luther King Jr. got shot by the FBI. It was there when Reagan let hundreds of LGBT people die from aids because it was \"God's punishment\".\n\nAll trump did was get a bunch of neo nazis who don't normally vote to vote. That's it. That's all he did to get in. All the mistakes, all the incompetence, sure, that doesn't help, but trump did not create white nationalism. Or eugenics. Or bigotry.\n\nAnd, by the way, no, they're not sick of it. When trump got a bunch of neo nazis who don't normally vote to vote, it put the republican party in the strongest position it had been for years. The supreme court is now firmly conservative. The republican party can now eternally grift off of the \"Donate to save america\" line.\n\nSo what's the problem? Well, there are a lot more normal people than there are extremists. That's the long and short of it. That's why Joe Biden won the 2020 election. But the thing is the conservative party hasn't realized this yet, and even if they have, they now depend on those neo nazis who used to not vote for votes. Which means that now they're stuck in the uncomfortable position of either losing a ton of centrists or a ton of extremists.\n\nAnd frankly? They deserve to be in this position. Old ideas give way to new ones for a reason. Wanting to stick with the old ways forever and wanting to turn the clock back to the 50s as if that will solve anything is why they're here. The sooner the GOP collapses, the better. If we must have two parties, then let one of them be, I don't know, the green party or something.",

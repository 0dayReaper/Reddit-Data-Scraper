Republicans know that they are winning over exactly zero Democratic voters and very few independents with the bullshit they've been pulling for the last few years, and they also know that their electoral margins are razor thin to begin with, given their poor showing in the 2022 midterms. They can't just throw away 20-30% of their votes. The next election will be a landslide against them if that happens. So they have no choice but to double down (triple? quadruple?) on support for Trump, no matter how politically suicidal it may seem, because the alternative is provably losing for them.\n\nPersonally I can't help but take some enjoyment in the incredibly shitty position this puts Congressional Republicans, because they 100% made this bed for themselves, but I still worry that this shitshow will cause more damage to the US as a whole before we see any real resolution.",

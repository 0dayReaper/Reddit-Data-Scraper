I'd love to be wrong about that, but he's absolutely going to try to stall things out while also running as the aggrieved \"victim\", which Republican voters fucking LOOOOOVE. Meaning he will likely win the nomination and be on the ticket in November.\n\nThis country's a shitshow. I want to be wrong, I really do, but I feel like I'm not.",

Not even considering all of the court cases and him likely going to jail, Jan 6th lost him the swing vote completely.  Anyone that said they were a swing voter and votes trump after that were never a swing voter and just liked to pretend.\n\nThe GOP knows this which is why they're desperately passing all legislation they can in the states to try to stop the loss of their states.\n\nFar out, if Trump is convicted too he legally won't even be on the ballet in a bunch of GOP states due to their state legislatures.  It could even see Tennessee and Texas bloody handed to the Dems.\n\nThe GOP are absolutely fucked already, it's only further downhill from here.  Their second runner is De Santis who's popularity is tanking too.\n\nGoing to be a reaaaally interesting GOP primary thats for sure lol.  Once trumps convicted and put in jail we could very well see the death knells of the GOP.",

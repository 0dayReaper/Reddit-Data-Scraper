I\u2019m talking \u201cyoung Desantis sharing a laugh with Epstein\u201d or \u201cTrump shaking hands with Soros\u201d next level stuff. Obvious yet outrageous material that grabs headlines thus bringing this issue to the general public before 2024. The idea is that instead of trying to sell the narrative that this ai stuff is going to be manageable in 2024, you instead show the public exactly what they will undoubtedly be dealing with to prep them for the flood of fake ads that are being developed right now by ai. It has to be obvious and unrealistic enough that conservatives will be able to tell it\u2019s not real.  This game is a bluff\u2014if people are outraged enough by what unethical things ai can do then they might be inspired enough to actually demand regulation and action. We need to shock the public now by introducing the new paradigm to them early, instead of lying to ourselves that this isn\u2019t going to be a huge problem moving forward.",

                    "comment": "DeSantis ushers in our fake-images-in-politics nightmare\nThe DeSantis campaign used what appear to be AI-generated images of Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci hugging. And it\u2019s unapologetic about crossing a line.\n\n\nAnalysis by Aaron Blake\nStaff writer\nJune 8, 2023 at 4:41 p.m. EDT\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis in National Harbor, Md., on April 21. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\nComment\n\nGift\n\nShare\nYou might want to take note of the following date: June 5, 2023. Because we might one day regard that as the date on which our politics very quietly crossed the Rubicon on AI-generated images.\nFew people noticed until Thursday, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s campaign that day released a deceptive web video featuring fake images of Donald Trump hugging former White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci.\n\nGet the full experience.\nChoose your plan\n\nWhile others have used artificial intelligence in their political messages before, this appears to be the first example of a major presidential campaign using it in such an obviously misleading fashion. And the DeSantis campaign is anything but apologetic about it.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe video, which the \u201cDeSantis War Room\u201d shared on Twitter, features six images of Trump and Fauci in the same frame. Three of them depict Trump hugging Fauci and appear to be AI-generated. One of those three features language on the White House sign behind the men that is gibberish \u2014 a feature of many AI-generated images. And if you look closely at another of the three, you\u2019ll notice that Fauci doesn\u2019t appear overly lifelike.\nBut most people won\u2019t look nearly that closely. The vast majority will view them as very small images on social media, and they will view them only briefly as the video moves on. And many conservatives will believe that the video indeed shows real-life Trump repeatedly hugging their much-reviled Fauci. The video even overlays the words \u201cREAL LIFE TRUMP\u201d over the entire video.\nTwitter added a Community Note to the video on Thursday, stating, \u201cThe 3 still shots showing Trump embracing Fauci are AI generated images.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who supports Trump, rebuked the DeSantis campaign on Thursday.\n\u201cSmearing Donald Trump with fake AI images is completely unacceptable,\u201d Vance tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not sharing them, but we\u2019re in a new era. Be even more skeptical of what you see on the internet.\u201d\nA new era indeed. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen what is apparently AI used in a major entity\u2019s political content. But this one certainly moves the ball forward \u2014 or perhaps backward \u2014 when it comes to misleading with fake images.\nIn late April, the Republican National Committee turned heads by releasing a video using AI images of what it imagined the United States might look like during a second Biden term. But the images were disclosed as being AI-generated. And given that the thrust was a supposed future we haven\u2019t yet realized, you could certainly argue it was less misleading to use fake scenes.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAfter DeSantis (R) entered the campaign two weeks ago, Trump promoted a video using AI-generated voices of the governor, Elon Musk and others, including a mock devil, \u201cAdolph Hitler\u201d and Dick Cheney. The video lampooned DeSantis\u2019s glitchy campaign launch on Twitter Spaces. But the conversation was so ridiculous as to be obvious parody.\nIn response to criticism of the new web video Thursday, the DeSantis campaign played the whataboutism card and rather flippantly dismissed concerns about its deception.\nIt pointed to a fake image Trump shared on social media of DeSantis riding a rhinoceros (the implication being that DeSantis is a RINO, or \u201cRepublican in Name Only.\u201d) The image looks a lot more like a crude photoshop than an AI image, though. It also seems much less likely to lead people to think it\u2019s genuine. And even to the extent people believe it\u2019s real, it would hardly be as damning as Trump hugging a much-hated figure on the right.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n(We\u2019ve seen before how such embraces with the wrong people can turn into political liabilities. Former Florida governor Charlie Crist once recounted his 2009 hug of then-President Barack Obama in a piece titled, \u201cThe Hug That Killed My Republican Career.\u201d)\nDeSantis\u2019s campaign then posted another response: a video featuring obviously fake footage of an airplane flapping its wings. \u201cPlanes cannot actually dance,\u201d it said. \u201cThat part of the video is NOT REAL.\u201d\nThis is a day that has been widely predicted. The Washington Post and others in recent months have written articles about how the significant recent advances in AI meant such deception in political campaigns was surely around the corner.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe more likely avenue seemed to be outside groups with less accountability and connection to actual candidates. But here we have a campaign itself quickly going down this road without any compunction.\nThe question from here is how our body politic reacts to it.\nA Democratic congresswoman has introduced a bill to require disclosure of AI-generated content in political ads. But agreeing on such legislation will be a tall task, especially given the Republican Party\u2019s reluctance to regulate political campaigns and speech.\nBeyond that, public condemnation like the kind offered by Vance could surely help police the issue. But we\u2019ve also seen the destruction of a multitude of political norms during the Trump era, with the attitude particularly on the right increasingly being that all is fair in love and war.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe DeSantis campaign\u2019s reaction is a byproduct of that, and it suggests the campaign has made a proactive decision to own its deception. The critics will be dismissed as oversensitive libs rather than those concerned about the consequences of this becoming our political reality.\nIn other words, don\u2019t plan on this getting resolved in any kind of neat fashion. It\u2019s on now. And people can accordingly judge those who declared open season.\n\n575\nComments\n\n\nGift Article\n\nBy Aaron Blake\nAaron Blake is senior political reporter, writing for The Fix.

Even if the Judge considers these arms particularly dangerous, they are not unusual.  \n\nIn 2016 Caetanno V Massachusetts The Supreme Court unanimously  decided that Stun Guns were in common use.  The court was told their was around 200,000 stun guns in existence in the US and that was enough for them to be  considered in common use.   There \n\nAnd in 2022 The Bruen Ruling instructed courts that are they are not supposed to be performing interest balancing tests on 2nd Amendment issues.",

                    "comment": "You could still buy ARs and AK-47s during the federal assault weapon ban. There were so many intentional loopholes including the sunset provision. You had two main choices really\n\n- preban: guns manufactured before the ban went into effect and could have all ban features\n- ban compliant: new guns with the called out features in the ban removed. Fixed stocks, non-threaded barrels etc.\n\nIt was strangely trendy for people to buy assault weapons during the ban, especially among professionals. I'd go to dinner parties and people who you'd never think would have a gun would break one out and showcase it by passing it around. And it was fucking scary. \n\nMy family is all military and, even though I was a minor, I knew how to clear a weapon. Gun safety is a big thing in our family. So imagine my surprise that not one but twice I was handed a gun makinf its way around the room to find it loaded. In gun safety rule 1 is all guns are loaded, so when you're handed one, even when you believe it's not loaded, you make it safe. So I\n- dropped the mag and saw bullets (???)\n- pulled back the bolt and a round ejected out (!!!!)\n\n\nPeople were pointing these things at each other and somehow didn't manage to shoot someone. \n\nTo this day, it's my belief that the federal assault weapon ban led to the proliferation of assault weapons and increased guns as an identity because we told Americans they couldn't have them.",

They really don't leave anything to the imagination.\n\n&gt;\"The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.\"\n- Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824\n\n&gt;\"The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.\"\n- Samuel Adams, Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, 1788\n\n&gt;\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\"\n- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776\n\n&gt;\u201cA militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves\u2026and include, according to the past and general usage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms\u2026 \"To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.\"\n- Richard Henry Lee, Federal Farmer No. 18, January 25, 1782\n\n&gt;\"[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\"\n- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28, January 10, 1788\n\n&gt;\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.\"\n- Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, October 10, 1787\n\n&gt;\"This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty.... The right of self defense is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\"\n- St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, 1803\n\n&gt;\"The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.\"\n- Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The FBI on Thursday arrested a businessman at the center of the scandal that led to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton&amp;#039;s historic impeachment, a move that came amid new questions about the men&amp;#039;s dealings raised by financial records the Republican&amp;#039;s lawyers made public to try to clear him of bribery allegations.\n\n&gt; The wire transfer was dated Oct. 1, 2020 - the same day Paxton&amp;#039;s deputies signed a letter informing the head of human resources at the Texas attorney general&amp;#039;s office that they had reported Paxton to the FBI. The $121,000 payment was to Cupertino Builders, whose manager was an associate of Paul, state corporation and court records show.\n\n&gt; Tony Buzbee, a prominent Houston attorney who was hired by Paxton over the weekend and led the news conference, said by email Thursday that receipts &amp;quot;Clearly demonstrate&amp;quot; Paxton paid for the repairs.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1459ff3/fbi_arrests_nate_paul_businessman_linked_to/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688360 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Paxton**^#1 **Paul**^#2 **FBI**^#3 **Office**^#4 **Texas**^#5",

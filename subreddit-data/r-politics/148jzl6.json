Much like how we've been conditioned to believe all psychopaths are intelligent because they always are \"two steps ahead\" in the movies we watch. \n\nMeanwhile, in the real world there are dumb people. I agree with your theory and also think Trump took those docs because he wanted to flex on his toadies. He wanted to be able to say \"I'm so important, look at all these important trophies I have.\"",

For four very long years, this man was President.  There was nothing at all abnormal about tons of secure documents of all kinds crossing his desk.  What led to this was a combination of his profound chaos and disorganization coupled with his hoarding behavior.  He just gradually over the weeks and months kept squirrelling away anything he deemed \"cool\"... or \"useful\".\n\nThis is fairly well described in the first few pages of the indictment.\n\nSo... as far as the scope of the *current* indictment we do not even need to ponder some dark mastermind .\n\nFor future things?

In all seriousness, Donald Trump's reading and comprehension skills are barely at preschool levels.  He didn't know what the nuclear triad was. He legitimately wanted to nuke a hurricane to knock it off course. He suggested people ingest bleach to fight covid. And I can go through a hundred more things each more progressively stupid than the first. Donald Trump is literally too stupid to understand any of the documents put before him, let alone request documents that specific from the archives under his own initiative. Therefore -someone- was acting as a value translator of sorts. I find it impossible to believe that Donald Trump acted on his own as he is, quite literally, too stupid to do so.

Your education system is way behind many other countries and this is what you get. \n\nThe same approach is used in South Africa, where I grew up. The government purposefully sabotage education there to keep the population illiterate and easily controlled. You can\u2019t find out about corruption if you can\u2019t read the news. On paper, we have a brilliant education system, but only for the wealthy. They completely fail at service delivery for the poor masses. And so, you get the ANC, a wildly corrupt government, in power for almost 30 years. \n\nFortunately, the tides are changing for the ANC and there is a grassroots movement to get them out, but the damage has been done. SA will take generations to recover, and I worry USA is next. Education is the key to any country\u2019s success or failure.",

If no one were above the law, then, as you point out, Trump would already be in jail for the crimes he committed as president. But Trump was never charged for any of the crimes he committed in office, so the only thing we've managed to prove is that the president is, indeed, above the law, which probably explains why Trump so desperately wants to become president again. And the fact that the president is above the law is something that should make every American stop and think whether the current system is truly just. It should also make us stop and think why so many people are trying to convince us that \"no one is above the law.\" Why are democrats misleading the American people? What do they gain from doing so?",

Maybe our lawmakers don't know that but as someone who makes software and understands the government has policies in place in the way the write code and host servers to be secure and not leak secrets I absolutely understand that this is the digital equivalent. \n\nHunter on the other hand while posting videos of him smoking what appeared to be crack filled out paperwork for the ATF to own a gun saying he was sober. This is a huge, felony sized issue.\n\nBiden on the other hand also had classified documents. I don't think he intended to do anything harmful and hence may not be liable, but I do think the fact that he's not all there and oftentimes sounds like my deceased grandma who had Alzheimer's has something to do with it.\n\nI think a big reason why the conservatives don't trust the institutions is because they feel the law isn't equally enforced when it comes to right vs left and politicians. I think there's some truth to it and quite frankly it's causing their insurrectionist mentality. They've cherry picked a handful of instances where maybe things weren't as fair as they could have been and then they've obsessed about it until it became a violent obsession. \n\n\nI don't think they're wrong to think the law is not equally applied in these circumstances but they are unequivocally wrong for the way they've handled it.\n\nThe faster the left realizes that maybe this plays into their mindset and they have a part of responsibility in how militant they've gotten, then maybe we'll start turning a corner.\n\nTo the left's credit (kinda), they've learned how to control the narrative to make a lot of conservative ideas look like they we're born in the third reich which is also not true at all. Maybe in parts of the rural south, but definitely not conservatives anywhere else in the country. I think the left does a great job demonizing christians for example for taking them as anti-lgbt when in actual christian theology treats being gay the same as it treats premarital sex for example and most pastors kids I've known rebel because they didn't get to go through that phase in life most kids do. Likewise it's easy to call the conservatives as gun obsessed rednecks, which, there is a lot of truth there, but the reality of it is for most of them it's just a \"machista\" front and they're softer than a lot of other men I know. All bark no bite. Machismo is still very alive in conservative america and that isn't always factored in to the equation.\n\n\\rant",

You're caught up in the \"who did what\" instead of taking a step back and analyzing this on a more macro scale.\n\nHunter committed a felony lying to the ATF. That's cut and dry. Hunter commited a felony when he bought whatever drugs he was smoking. That's cut and dry.  Biden could be put on trial depending on the strength of the evidence for his shenanigans keeping classified documents but it's unlikely he intended to do anything criminal. Still not a good look to conservatives.\n\nI'm not trying to say, one side is better than the other. At this point in time that's clearly not true. One thing I'm trying to get at is illegal behavior is illegal behavior and the law needs to be enforced across the board. Do you think if conservatives thought it was enforced equally that they'd be so willing to bring guns to the capitol? The only reason why Trump was able to get through to the conservatives and have them do dumb things is because they already believe they're being institutionally targeted and justifying the behavior of one side and not the other clearly is creating the militant conservatives that are causing issues. Also, their belief of being targeted I don't think is completely hallucinated; I think there's some truth to it.\n\nThe left has created what the right is by demonizing them. The reason why the right hasn't come close is to doing the same thing to the left is because they don't know anything about marketing or media and are generally unsophisticated in this area of things. The left right now has helped create the worst parts of the right. The left is helping create domestic terrorists though political favoritism.\n\nNot only that, it really looks like Venezuela when the presidents kid films himself doing illegal things and then the media tries discrediting and burying it and years later nothing has come of it. The conservatives and much of the world frankly realizes this and further serves for the right's militant side to keep reading about how the second amendment is meant for tyranny and how the government is becoming more tyrannical.\n\nRemember back after 9/11 we were talking about how mistreating muslims gives way to further extremism? I'm not sure why people cannot draw a parallel here. Probably because they're too caught up in who did what and demonizing the other side instead of actually taking a step back and thinking about this.\n\nThe best thing to do here is charge Hunter, investigate them very very closely like they've done with Trump and send a message to the world that in the US the law is equally applied between political opponents. Of course we need to continue investigating Trump and Family as well and go that direction full steam ahead.   \n\n\nThe media also needs to learn journalistic integrity. It wasn't that long ago the media was required by law tell both sides of the story. That was repealed a while ago as it's hard to enforce anyway.  This will help defuse the conservatives and bring down the political temperature quite a bit in the country.",

It is a widely known fact that the left is terrible at messaging.  Meanwhile, the right has Fox, OANN, and dozens of AM talk radio shows across the country indoctrinating their listeners/viewers.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing\\_terrorism#United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_terrorism#United_States)\n\nFor Biden's part a lot of assumptions have to be made. It doesn't matter that Biden called the FBI as soon as he found them that completely misses the point. He took them to begin with and we don't know if, or who he shared information with. The National Archives makes it clear that taking classified documents outside of official premises is against the law. There is no circumstance where its not.

The left owns the media and there are many many many PhD led studies that prove this. The only thing that's still disputed is if the left-wing bias leeches into the actual news stories written by the majority left-leaning journalists. Let me ask you something, if the country's media is overwhelmingly liberal how are the conservatives marketing geniuses? They're not at all. Deep south marketing looks pretty damn similar to local Colombian marketing. I know I live there.\n\nHere's a couple of sources: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay9344](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay9344) keep in mind this one says that the liberal media doesn't cherry pick stories; that doesn't mean that the stories aren't biased only that they don't cherry pick stories.\n\nHere's another explaining how over the years the media has shifted left and is now majority left-leaning. [https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/media-bias-left-study/](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/media-bias-left-study/)\n\nSo what's really going on here? Exactly as I said. The perception that the law isn't enforced equally between political opponents on the national level  AND that the media has ganged up on conservatives. So when these quack news sources like OAN and InfoWars gain steam so quickly, it isn't because they've spent millions on clever marketing campaigns, it's because they're the only ones resonating with conservatives telling them that the people they support ARE being persecuted on top of the obvious fact that it's serving an underserved market in 2023.You're cherry-picking what you think is acceptable and not applying ethics equally. Instead of saying, \"yeah both sides likely did something illegal and they both should have their day in court\" you're making excuses for your preferred ideology which is exactly how third world countries operate. Again, I know this because I live in one after living in the US for 25 years. So, you're doing exactly what the conservatives claim and then basically gaslighting them which is why they've become militant because that's the machista culture they live in.",

Then Robbie Mook came out and said Clinton gave a green light for the now debunked Steele Dossier. Even the MSM is pulling back on all RussiaGate, even Rachel Maddow was basically benched because she pushed RussiaGate so hard, that she hurt her own public credibility. This was all confirmed by the Durham Report. \n\nI'm OK with Trump going to prison if he broke the law. But in a different matter, no one should say \"our system is working\" if Hillary Clinton is walking around free. There was an open conspiracy with Clinton, Obama, Comey, the DOJ, the FBI and CIA. Even if people hate Trump, that's completely indefensible. \n\nHillary Clinton was a horrible candidate in 2016, and she did everything in her power to cheat her way to POTUS. That's unforgiveable. No \"Whataboutism\" about Trump will change that. \n\nIf you go after high level elected officials, you need to go after all of them. Jeanine Pirro made a very good point, and no one listens to her because she works for FNC, but she pointed out that lies were told to the FISA court to get warrants to push investigations based on the corrupt fruit of the debunked Steele Dossier. \n\nSo no, \"our system is not working\" \n\nAlso, it's clear the MSM is doing it's best to pretend RFK Jr doesn't exist. That would make it a THIRD primary in a row for the DNC where it's clear that they don't want the actual American people, particularly registered Democrats,  to have a choice.  (Sanders was turfed in 2016 and 2020, they changed the debate rules on Tulsi Gabbard in 2020, and now they are coming after RFK Jr)  The majority of those polled across multiple polling outlets and across time shows that no one wants Biden to be the choice for the 2024 general election. Not just Republicans, but also Democrats too. Biden is a horrible candidate for 2024 and he's being forced onto every Democratic working class voter in the entire country.",

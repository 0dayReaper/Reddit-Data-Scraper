So after years of prior consultation and transitioning progress, Jazz Jennings did in fact have trans surgery, four months prior to turning 18. As rare as it is for someone to get surgery that early, you are correct in your assertion that trans surgery does happen prior to 18. *Sometimes.*\n\nThe problem I was bringing up earlier has to do with the deliberate hysteria. There is now a massive, organized campaign to ban *all* gender-affirming care, *regardless of age* -- not just surgery, but also pills, therapy, and even non-conforming *clothing*. And this has been done in part by knowingly spreading false ideas about \"prepubescent kids being fast-tracked into surgery by the woke mob\", when that's simply not the reality of the situation.\n\nThe malicious act of spreading misinformation for the sake of hurting others is rampant on this topic. I can dig up a pile of relevant, solid medical and scientific links that would be a lot more helpful.",

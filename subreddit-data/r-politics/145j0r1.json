He clearly knew they were classified. Trump acknowledged that in the recording. He knew the DoJ would go after him if he didn't return the documents. The Archives, the FBI repeatedly told Trump this, over and over again.\n\nWhy not just read and return the documents, in 2021 or early 2022? Couldn't he have just copied what he didn't read, then returned the documents anyway? He doesn't even really need the originals. I get that Trump broke the law here. I just don't understand why he would do this, when warned over and over. I don't see anything in the indictment about motivation either, unless I'm missing something.",

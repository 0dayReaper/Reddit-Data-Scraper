They wanted to build infrastructure like railroads and factories as well as give western lands to farmers in order to isolate and surround the slave states of the south and let slavery fall in time due to its own institutional weaknesses. They wanted public schools and colleges. This was a party of modernization and progress, not a party of regression. If we look at Eisenhower's platform in 1956, it was a natural growth of these ideas, federal assistance to low income areas, a higher minimum wage, extended unemployment benefits, support of unions and labor laws, and equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. The Republicans of today are basically the opposite.",

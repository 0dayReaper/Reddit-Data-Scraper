The first time they were able to nail him for something, him and everyone around him were gonna go down together. We were all just waiting for this. That it didn't happen at a million points already proves that yeah, when the crimes involved anyone outside of his shitty little circle of unimportant people, he was indeed insulated from consequences.",

It then segues into powerful people not being held accountable for the war dead, that those are crimes on a major scale. When it finally mentions trump it\u2019s to falsely state his current troubles are the result of hush money to Stormy Daniels, as if he did that by himself and mishandling of classified documents (as if he did that by himself and as if the scope of what he did and it\u2019s consequences to everyone, including civilians in foreign lands, are somehow small and of no consequence.  \n\nThe Intercept is certainly not the publication it used to be\n\nJust a sampling since it\u2019s clear from the comments no one bothered to open the link\n\n&gt;This is American politics \u2014 and politics generally \u2014 in miniature and why it\u2019s nearly impossible for societies to punish the perpetrators of great crimes: Anything terrible on a large scale demands broad elite endorsement and participation. When it comes to major evils, most people at the top must be guilty for it to happen in the first place. And so everyone gets away with it.\n\n&gt;Think about the Vietnam War. Lyndon Johnson and Nixon were most responsible for it, murdering perhaps two to four million people across Indochina. (We don\u2019t have a more exact number because we\u2019ve never cared enough to make a serious effort to find out.)\n\n&gt;But achieving this body count, far greater than any serial killer could ever dream of, obviously required buy-in from far more people than just these two presidents. How could any legitimate justice process convict just Johnson and Nixon? The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed in the House of Representatives 416-0 and in the Senate 88-2. Congress affirmatively voted to fund the war for years.\n\n&gt;Or take the war on terror, which appears to have caused 4.5 million deaths. The post-9/11 Authorization for Use of Military Force flew through Congress with only a lone House member voting against it. Even Bernie Sanders voted yes. 296 members of the House and 77 senators voted for war with Iraq. As in \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d there was a lot of stabbing by a lot of people.\n\n&gt;This dynamic holds true to an extent even when a society is conquered. The Nuremberg trial process included prosecutions beyond the most famous Nazi officials. But of over 3,000 potential cases, most were dropped, and by the 1950s, those sentenced to prison had almost all been released \u2014 because the U.S. needed German elites to help us run Germany. The trials of Japanese war criminals were even less consequential for the same reasons, with Emperor Hirohito explicitly excluded from any responsibility.\n\n&gt;However, it is occasionally possible for societies to address minor crimes that major figures commit by themselves or with a small circle of cronies. Probably Trump\u2019s most significant crime was his support for the Saudi war on Yemen, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. But Trump shares his guilt with a large chunk of the U.S. political system, so that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s the hush money for Stormy Daniels and mishandling of classified documents that have tripped him up.",

We\u2019re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It\u2019s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we\u2019ve been taken.

Nobody said he wasn't a great marketer and he was willing to market himself to some of the scummiest people in order to grab power and there were Plenty of \"loyal\" \"christians\" willing to back the entire thing because they felt as though it was part of some predetermined outcome due to an overly superstitious reading of scriptures and multiple generations of programming. You got to remember, Pat Robertson was making bank off of just showing up on TV and telling people with cancer that they should send money to him instead of going to the doctor. These people have no morals and yet they try to argue that those of us who speak for common decency are somehow woke rather than exactly what their prophets preached.\n\nThis man spent years playing the game and recognizes the ways in which influence, money, and \"confidence\" have ruled the economic landscape since the dawn of time.\n\nProfits speak louder than prophets.

They would have called him the son of Joseph but the argument that he was the son of Yahweh directly is something that is antithetical to the whole concept of the jewish tradition. It was syncretic but in my opinion more humanist than deist, melding the name of the Lord into contemporary philosophical interpretations of the world that were happening at the time that we are even now struggling to understand. The concept of word as Lord is literally right there at the very beginning of John and so many people would rather place their hope in their imagination and superstition than have faith and love in their common man.",

All he needs to do is say they're kicked off team Trump and immediately they lose a large enough portion of votes that they're no longer electable. So this leaves them the choice of doing the right thing by both the law and democracy or self-preservation. The vast majority are choosing self-preservation over what they (surely) know is right for our country. Whether we agree with her politics or not, Liz Cheney was one of the few who saw her own lot as not being more important than that of the country's. Until the Republican Party collectively finds the courage to put country over self-interest, this madness won't die until Trump does.",

What could possibly be the last straw for them to realize that the current GOP is no longer able to be saved if its willingness to still support someone who literally stole classified documents isn\u2019t enough??? They must have enough contacts for high level\nPolitical donations. I don\u2019t care for their policies much but would much rather have an opposition party that is at least mostly steeped in reality instead of the current party\u2019s fantasy land of conspiracy theories and paranoia.

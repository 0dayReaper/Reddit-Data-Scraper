We\u2019re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It\u2019s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we\u2019ve been taken.

Nobody said he wasn't a great marketer and he was willing to market himself to some of the scummiest people in order to grab power and there were Plenty of \"loyal\" \"christians\" willing to back the entire thing because they felt as though it was part of some predetermined outcome due to an overly superstitious reading of scriptures and multiple generations of programming. You got to remember, Pat Robertson was making bank off of just showing up on TV and telling people with cancer that they should send money to him instead of going to the doctor. These people have no morals and yet they try to argue that those of us who speak for common decency are somehow woke rather than exactly what their prophets preached.\n\nThis man spent years playing the game and recognizes the ways in which influence, money, and \"confidence\" have ruled the economic landscape since the dawn of time.\n\nProfits speak louder than prophets. Trust me, Cassandra knows.",

They would have called him the son of Joseph but the argument that he was the son of Yahweh directly is something that is antithetical to the whole concept of the jewish tradition. It was syncretic but in my opinion more humanist than deist, melding the name of the Lord into contemporary philosophical interpretations of the world that were happening at the time that we are even now struggling to understand. The concept of word as Lord is literally right there at the very beginning of John and so many people would rather place their hope in their imagination and superstition than have faith and love in their common man.",

This tactic of paying for the lawyers of the low-level goons on his \"side\" and using that access to shape and control their legal strategy is something that Trump has been using for a while.\n\nIf you see Nauta switch from a Trump-sponsored lawyer to his own lawyer, *then* maybe you could expect to see something from him.

Talk about a guy that should have known better but still did it anyway. I feel for the valet a lot more than cohen, being stupid and lying to the fbi is a guy who was too stupid to think trump was going to cover him. I imagine right now his attorney is telling him his only way out is to roll on trump. If he has an attorney not paid by trump that is. If trump or some murky bag man is paying for his attorney then he is fucked.",

This alone should be something we prepared for as a country and I\u2019ll bet that it\u2019s something that will be a future amendment. \n\nTo be clear, you make excellent points why she definitely shouldn\u2019t be the presiding judge on this case due to her erroneous rulings, I just feel all of that doesn\u2019t even matter looking at the whole picture. \n\nWe just saw a judge in Florida recuse himself over a distant family member having a ridiculously small *possible* conflict of interest involving Disney shares but yet we allow a judge to preside over the very person that appointed them. How are we supposed to take the Justice system seriously?",

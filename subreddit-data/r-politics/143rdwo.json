This is the most partisan Court of my (and likely any living person's) memory. Their decisions for cases where politics comes into play makes sense if you think of them as actual politicians. The correct calculated move is to give the Dems \"wins\" in obvious cases where the Republicans don't really care about the issues anyway. That's this to a tee\n\nThis is the perfect case for this hyper Republican (note, not \"conservative\") Court to \"throw a win\" to the Dems so they can point to it and say \"see, we aren't super partisan, we swear\".",

This implies that Congress believes it already gave the President (in this case, Biden) that specific power and is just now trying to rescind it.\n\nBut who am I kidding. It\u2019s 2023, one third of the bench was appointed by someone who cheated themselves into the White House and took bribes like they\u2019re tic tacs. To distract us from that fact, Alito will probably go off on another medieval witch bender and neuter yet another Department of the federal government and hand power to the dysfunctional Congress. When the next Republican president takes office they will ignore all these rulings, ignore Congress, and get away with doing whatever they want, particularly as they relate to things Republicans cry Bloody Mary when Biden does them.",

For 3 straight years Carson in front of congress and claimed that he didn't know he needed various directors, or that HUD actually does things. Congresspeople each time pointed out that they had asked him repeatedly and in fact sent staffers to explain what HUD actually does many times.\n\n\nTrumps replacement for the head of the Department of Justice was Bill Barr, who buried Iran Contra, gave blanket immunity to literally everyone involved with it except Oliver North, who he gave a token low security sentence. \n\n\nHis Vice President Mike Pence spent years as Governor of his state dismantling and blocking absolutely everything to do with handling the HIV epidemic, which caused Indiana to have such a spike in HIV cases that it had the highest rate in the country. \n\n\n\nEvery single fucking person trump put into a government position was as cruel, greedy, and horrible as could be found.",

First, the PPP plan was voted on in congress rather than just being an executive order like the loan forgiveness. Second is that PPP was to basically help with payroll since the government was forcing business to shut down. Most businesses didn't *want* to shut down, but they were ordered to by the government so the PPP loans were intended to help keep the business going and to cover payroll so the workers didn't go broke. Honestly, I think those are decent arguments. I still support student loan forgiveness, but it isn't really a fair thing to directly compare the two for those reasons. \n \nNow all that being said, the biggest problem with PPP loans is the complete lack of oversight. I think the idea of giving loans to businesses that had to close because of covid was a good idea, but their absolutely should have been a committee or something overseeing where the loans were going. \n \nAnd again, like I said, I'm a big supporter of the 10k/20k loam forgiveness plan because I think our student loan system is an absolute disaster and needs to be overhauled. The 20k forgiveness would be a good way to help people who are already in it, then reworking the interest rates and cost of education needs to be included so it isn't just a bandaid fix and we end up in the same situation 10 years from now. However, I don't like it when someone asks that question you asked and a bunch of people just come out saying \"because they hate education!\" or \"because they want to destroy the middle class!\". That's a big oversimplification of things and doesn't actually help to understand where the other side is coming from which I think is very important.",

It originally was proposed with an oversight mechanism, which was intentionally *removed* by republicans lol. So no, any \"argument\" that the PPP loans were different because they were meant to help businesses or workers is just completely disingenuous. The truth is pretty evident: the entire program was built for businesses and wealthy individuals to rip off taxpayers.",

You can actually use his quote from the CNN Town Hall regarding this as well... \"Well I wasn't president then\"...\n\nThere is so much evidence of him completely contradicting himself on Twitter or on camera in the past. Remember when he was using burner phones leading up to January 6th and then claimed he didn't even know what a burner phone was... And then he forgot he appeared on a [sitcom](https://youtu.be/Njrwasa5YFo) literally showing him using a burner. (It's at the end of the video)",

They make decisions based on intuition.\n\nOne thing that their primitive intuition can accurately discern is the difference between a true believer and an actor. Most GOP politicians, including DeSantis, are too intelligent to actually believe most of the things that they say. The base can tell that the Republican elite is not made up of people like them.\n\nBut Trump has a unique gift. He is stupid enough to come to believe that his own lies are true. He genuinely believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton is guilty of the same thing that he has done with classified documents. Normally, such a stupid person can't advance within the Republican Party, but because of a large inheritance and a long history of media attention, he has had a unique opportunity.\n\nThis is why they love Trump. The base can feel that he, and only he, is truly one of their kind.",

What they then do is not particularly relevant when discussing purely their ability to gain supporters.\n\nYou have to make people think they are troubled, and then give them some other group to blame for all the ills in the world, and then talk about how you will fix everything and/or punish those responsible. And then individuals en mass need to not apply any logic, which is apparently an easy thing to have happen.",

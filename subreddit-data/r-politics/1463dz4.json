You can actually use his quote from the CNN Town Hall regarding this as well... \"Well I wasn't president then\"...\n\nThere is so much evidence of him completely contradicting himself on Twitter or on camera in the past. Remember when he was using burner phones leading up to January 6th and then claimed he didn't even know what a burner phone was... And then he forgot he appeared on a [sitcom](https://youtu.be/Njrwasa5YFo) literally showing him using a burner. (It's at the end of the video)",

Start from the assumption that she is simply trying to maximize her own chances of winning and doesn't care if a democrat or republican wins otherwise. If she runs as a democrat, she will almost certainly lose the primary. If she switched parties and ran as a republican, she would also almost certainly lose the primary. \n\nIf she runs as an independent and there is a credible democrat candidate, she will also almost certainly lose. But in that case she might draw enough votes to be a spoiler and let the republican win. She won't get a lot, but she won't get any republican votes so it can only hurt the dems. So she is hoping she can threaten the dems into not running a real candidate, that's her only chance. Someone else will be the official nomination but it's just possible it's a no-namer and she can convince the national party not to support them or spend much money. Essentially it's a game of chicken, trying to get the dems to blink. The odds are low but from her perspective it's worth taking the risk because she loses nothing if they don't. She doesn't care about red or blue, she just cares about herself.",

It shows that Hillary lost the Midwest because she was too conservative to keep the Obama coalition together. Obama also won in '08 by criticizing NAFTA.\n\nCorporate politicians and pundits spin Brown's trade views as conservative in order to de-legitimize them.",

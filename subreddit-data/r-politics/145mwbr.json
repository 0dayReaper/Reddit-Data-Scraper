How can anyone, who calls themselves an American not recoil in disgust at what Trump did with some of the most sensitive, and important pieces of information our country has? \n\nTrump is a rotten POS and should be in jail for the rest of his stinking life! \n\nThe Republicans need to snap out of this insanity and take a good, hard look at what Trump did and get on the right side of the law! \n\nAnd as far as Fox goes, it is time Murdoch gets his pants sued off! \n\nShame on all of them! Do they really want to live in a country ruled by a PoS like Trump??.",

How can anyone, who calls themselves an American not recoil in disgust at what Trump did with some of the most sensitive, and important pieces of information our country has?\n\nIt has become so customary and habitual for Republicans to respond to instances when other Republicans have been found to or have been alleged to have acted inappropriately or illegally to collectively and aggressively deny and undermine the facts and significance of the situation. Democrats don't default to this position. Unfortunately, this strategic response by Republicans has proven to be more than effective in its ability to manipulate public discourse, especially when it is accepted by a league of voters that have no desire, ability or intention of allowing those that share their political affiliation to be mocked, criticized or held accountable. This is why Al Franken is no longer a member of the Senate, while so many other Republican representatives affiliated with far more heinous instances of wrongdoing face limited backlash and retain their positions. One political party needs to remain legitimate in its actions, while the other cares about nothing more than furthering and legislating the motivations of an angry and hate-filled voting block without the restrictions of the need to remain honorable.",

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Jean-Paul Sartre",

They swore an oath to uphold the law. They are approving lifetime appointments for Judges. The former President was asked to return these documents he tried to find ways to not return them. He showed the documents to people he knew to be recording the interview. He even admitted he should not have them and should not be showing them. That\u2019s the way he behaved when he was being recorded, what happened when no one was recording. It\u2019s time to find a replacement. Trump isn\u2019t good at selling steaks, education, air travel, or winning the most votes. He\u2019s surrounded by people who go to prison for their help to him and then distances himself from them as they fall on the sword. Why are so many people willing to go to jail for a self serving person whose horrible at crimes. Is that the best candidate the GOP can get?",

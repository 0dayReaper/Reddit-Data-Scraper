Literally, just a small segment of wall that took out all the lush green space around it all by itself. I couldn't help but think that was a perfect example of exactly how useless the whole concept was from the beginning. Also, a perfect example of destroying the surrounding natural habitat for nothing. In the other window was a Republican Congressperson frothing at the mouth about how it needs to get done. Pathetic and moronic.\n\nIf anything, the wall was just another historic grift of the government to contractors that are GOP donors and Trump supporters. Not to mention the Bannon \"build the wall\" grift.\n\n&gt;And now, as the Pentagon contends with a pandemic, the US Army has doled out another half billion dollars to a federal contracting firm with a history of making GOP donations to build sections of Trump's border wall at an above-market rate, [the Daily Beast reported on Thursday night.\u00a0](https://www.thedailybeast.com/army-decides-a-coronavirus-pandemic-is-a-good-time-to-give-gop-donors-dollar569-million-to-build-the-wall?ref=scroll)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[According to a public notice posted by the Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2148296/source/GovDelivery/) on Tuesday, the US Army Corps of Engineers announced a $569 million no-bid contract to BFBC, a firm affiliated with Barnard Construction, to build 17.7 miles of the border wall in El Centro and San Diego, California to be completed in June 2021.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Bozeman, Montana based firm has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican politicians over the years, and been awarded over $1 billion in federal contracts to build sections of the border wall so far.\u00a0\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/us-army-gave-firm-569-million-border-wall-gop-donations-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-army-gave-firm-569-million-border-wall-gop-donations-2020-4)",

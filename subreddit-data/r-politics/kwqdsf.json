    "postText": "The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. \n\nThis is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden\u2019s administration.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[A House majority, including several Republicans, votes to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/trump-impeachment-vote-house.html) | nytimes.com\n[House reaches threshold to impeach Trump for second time after he incited Capitol riot](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/13/politics/house-vote-impeachment/index.html) | cnn.com\n[Majority of House votes to impeach Trump for inciting deadly Capitol riot](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/house-to-impeach-trump-for-inciting-capitol-riot.html) | cnbc.com\n[House records enough votes to impeach Trump for 2nd time](https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/01/13/trump-on-verge-of-2nd-impeachment-after-capitol-siege/) | local10.com\n[Congressman Meijer will vote to impeach Trump for inciting Capitol riots](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2021/01/congressman-meijer-will-vote-to-impeach-trump-for-inciting-capitol-riots.html?utm_campaign=mlivedotcom_sf&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social) | mlive.com\n[U.S. House poised to impeach Trump for second time; McConnell spurns immediate trial](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/u-s-house-charges-toward-trump-impeachment-as-some-republicans-join-effort-idUSKBN29I190?edition-redirect=ca) | reuters.com\n['Fascist-Enabling Coward': McConnell Declines to Reconvene Senate for Trial as House Moves to Impeach Trump](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/01/13/fascist-enabling-coward-mcconnell-declines-reconvene-senate-trial-house-moves) | commondreams.org\n[House votes to impeach President Donald Trump for second time following Capitol riot](https://www.boston25news.com/news/house-votes-impeach-president-donald-trump-second-time-following-capitol-riot/U74WTH44BFED7LFQACD33DQBJA/) | boston25news.com\n[Majority in US House has voted to impeach President Trump for incitement of insurrection; voting still underway](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/majority-in-us-house-has-voted-to-impeach-president-trump-for-incitement-of-insurrection-voting-still-underway/2021/01/13/d4e5d92a-55e5-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html) | washingtonpost.com\n[House votes to impeach, Trump becomes only president impeached](https://apnews.com/article/trump-impeachment-vote-capitol-siege-0a6f2a348a6e43f27d5e1dc486027860) | apnews.com\n[LIVE COVERAGE: House votes to impeach Trump after Capitol insurrection](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/533981-live-coverage-house-to-vote-to-impeach-trump-after-capitol-insurrection?amp) | thehill.com\n[Majority of U.S. House members vote to impeach Trump a second time](https://fortune.com/2021/01/13/trump-impeached-second-time-first-in-history-house-vote-gop-democrats-senate-trial/) | fortune.com\n[Majority of House votes to impeach Trump after U.S. Capitol siege](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/majority-of-house-votes-to-impeach-trump-after-u-s-capitol-siege-idUSKBN29I2DB) | reuters.com\n[House Democrats vote to impeach Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection](https://www.salon.com/2021/01/13/house-democrats-vote-to-impeach-donald-trump-for-inciting-an-insurrection/) | salon.com\n[House votes to impeach Donald Trump; 1st president ever impeached twice](https://wqow.com/2021/01/13/house-votes-to-impeach-donald-trump-1st-president-ever-impeached-twice/) | wqow.com\n[GOP Rep.

He was probably looking at the MAGAs as a great source of income for years to come, no matter what moderate levels of resentment the rest of the world has toward him. Maybe in a few years he pulls a Partial Bush and rehabilitates his image a bit. The money would flow. Especially if he made it out of office without completely pissing off the establishment Right.\n\nIf he's a legitimate pariah, on the other hand, then that's only going to go so far.",

They voted for this *after* being victims to an insurrection of their own making. \n\nWhen lawsuits were laughed out of court, SCOTUS tossed cases out, Trump's own AG confirmed no widespread fraud and Trump's own election official called it \"the most secure election in history\"...\n\n..The GOP House still backed the lie, signaling to 74 million Americans an election was \"stolen\" from them. Elected representatives have essentially been telling their votes that their rights have been trampled upon. Their votes have been stolen. A President has illegally usurped power, and democracy is over.\n\nThat is the incitement.\n\nNow they are suddenly silent on these incendiary election claims. Not because of any new evidence or legal decisions, mind you. But because they were always lying - and they knew it. They were always fueling this incitement, and they are complicit.",

The house had passed a version and  the Senate passed their version. Passing the same version through both was impossible and the ACA was dead. One of Obama's adviser's suggested that they see if Nancy would be willing to pass the Senate version. That meant she would have to go back get the votes again on a version that they did not like. They could then later try to fix it through reconciliation. This is the reason Nancy famously said, \"We have to pass it to see what is in it\" which she caught hell for. \n\nObama called Nancy and when he presented the option to her she apparently went on a 15 minute rant about how it would be impossible and that it was BS how not one GOP senator would help. When she finally stopped ranting to take a breath Obama said, \"So...does that mean you are with me?\" She shot back, \"Of course I am with you. There is no way we are going to reward the GOP by just giving up.\" She then apparently then started going over how she was going to make it happen. When Obama hung up the phone he looked at his advisers and said, \"Damn I love that woman.\"\n\nSide note: There was a public option in the Senate version but Joe Lieberman would not vote for it with it in there. You can literally thank Joe for the reason there is a not a public option.",

He failed, and was impeached, but the cowardly Republicans in the Senate did not remove him.\n\nDespite his cheating and even 62 losses in post-election lawsuits, Trump still lost the election.  He even lost the court cases in front of Republican judges that Trump himself had appointed.  Undetered, Trump resorted to the support of his domestic terrorists to try to overturn the election. Despite their attack on the Capitol, they failed and Trump remained the rightful loser of the 2020 election.\n\nIn response, Trump was impeached today for a second time for inciting the terrorists that attacked America. He is the only President to be impeached twice and the only President to incite domestic terrorists to attack our nation.\n\nTrump will always remembered as the worst of the American presidents. He is the biggest failure of all the American presidents. Despite the following in his current cult, the truth has shown through.  Over time, his cult members will naturally pass away, as we all do.  Eventually there will be none of his supporters left and all that remains will be the history books and the memory of what a failure he was.  A failure as a president and a failure as a human being.\n\nCongratulations Trump.  You are one of the most hated men in the entire world, and you deserve it..",

            "comment": "NBC just made a damn good point about McConnell not calling the Senate back early. The FBI is expected to release a LOT more information about the Capitol siege in the coming days, much of which is supposed to be \"disturbing\" and \"shocking\" (which is saying a LOT considering what we already know about it). \n\nMcConnell is a slimy piece of shit, but he's not an idiot. Reports say he wants to purge the GOP of Trump, and he's not gonna do that if he moves too quickly. If he brings the Senate back early and rushes this, we may miss key details from the FBI's findings on this. We're expecting some bombshells in the coming days, some of which could very well present irrefutable proof of Trunp's crimes. We already know what he did but GOP lawmakers still seem to like to pretend he wasn't aware of or complicit in the riots. The FBI might have something that will FINALLY make it impossible for Trump loyalists in the Senate to ignore (some will likely still find a way though).\n\nMcConnell's own influence only goes so far; Cruz and Hawley are proof of that. McConnell wanted nothing to do with the Electoral challenges; if his influence alone was enough, the other senators would've backed down. When the FBI findings begin to drop, McConnell can not only use that to push more of his Senate Republicans to vote for the impeachment, but can also vote for it and claim his vote as a matter of evidence, rather than a matter of personal disagreement with Trump. He can make it look like, in light of the evidence, he and his cohorts have \"no choice\" but to vote in favor, allowing them to maintain at least some of their current voter base without being viewed as a traitor.\n\nThis is all just my own speculation, but I think McConnell is waiting for a slam dunk case before he moves forward.",

Don't care about stupid comparisons to the Portland riots. Don't care that there's only a week left. Don't give a flying fuck that it is going to \"divide\" us more. If Republicans wanted unity, they would start telling their constituents the truth about the election results and about the actions of their dear leader. This country is so fucked. Good luck Joe and the Dems.",

Also, even if they tried to jettison him now, he would burn it all down in response. He would run 3rd party, and if he can't get on the ballot, he would tell the MAGAs to write his name in. He will destroy any shot the GOP has in 2024 if they deny him his \"rightful\" position.",

They'll delay the trial as long as possible by arguing over every minor detail, they'll file motion after motion objecting to things that won't amount to anything but *will* make everything take longer. This will drag any hope of a conviction out to well beyond 2024.\n\nAnd when he gives his speech at the convention, he'll argue that all of his legal troubles are only persecution because the political establishment is just oh so afraid of him, and he's oh so brave to stand up to them and run anyway because he had a great life before running for president, I mean you can just literally hear this in his voice before he even says it, right?\n\nAnd all the Republicans opposing him now (and it's a short list) will fall in line and say, \"Yeah, he wasn't my first pick but he's better than Biden so we gotta vote for him\" and there you have it, Trump 2024. Now, I do think he will lose to Biden yet again and that will humiliate him enough that he'll be done politically (though he'll still cry foul, the GOP is going to get tired of hitching on to a losing horse).",

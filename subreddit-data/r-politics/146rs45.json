There are these few votes where he has crossed the line, but never mistake him for a moderate. That would be a huge whitewashing. \n\nNC is near 50/50 red/blue with a significant group of independents.  They are so Gerrymandered though that the state legislature has a super majority of Republicans. These come from underpopulated red religious areas. You step outside the cities, you are in trump land flying confederate flags. They are the people in control. \n\nWhen the city of Charlotte voted to protect LGBTQ+ workers, the state of NC punished the city by creating the draconian bathroom bill. ( Whatever happened to the GOP insistence on \"local rule\" ?) \n\nThank the Democratic governor for keeping things sane.  Now the GOP has enough votes to override his veto and are ready to out-Texas Texas. A democratic representative from a true blue district which voted her in because of her progressive stances woke up one day to discover she'd changed her mind and became a Republican. It was a WTF. \n\nThere is such a huge chasm in NC between the Democrats and Republicans, that it is inconceivable one could overnight decide they had a change of heart. She probably fears they are going to split the district and she wants to keep her job. Despicable.  \n\nWe have local heroes who have been fighting the good fight, if you can afford to give. \n\nhttps://natashamarcus.com/\n\nhttps://www.graigmeyer.com/\n\nThings are about to get very rough here.\n\nEdit: clarity",

It\u2019s a strange state. People often forget about or don\u2019t know about  the rural areas that are heavily conservative and actually can sway the vote more so than the big cities and the educated collage areas. \n\nMy favorite bout the politics is that the senate seat always comes down to what feels like one cheat over the other, and since some new moral crime. My dad said Tilis is an inside trader thats why he sometimes votes blue, but that other guy, Dan  was a disgraced army vet who cheated on his wife. \ud83d\ude02",

At a time when they needed to be more moderate they got more extreme, helping to lose them seats, alienating the moderates that won statewide office.\n\nI mean Katie Hobbs won the AZ governorship by a larger than I would have expected margin.  She's quite a weak candidate in terms of campaigning and charisma.  Had they run a moderate republican instead of Lake, republicans might have done a bit better instead of reaching a ceiling.\n\nPerhaps this will play out in 2026 in NC but it might be too early.  Dems need NC to get a senate majority once they lose the seats in MT, OH &amp; WV.",

The post-nuclear world was never going to be taken over by military force. It's going to be taken over by economic means, and that's exactly what China is doing.\n\nI'm from Canada, your most subservient ally. We're the nation that shit away our decades-long global reputation as peacekeepers in order to join Dubya's oil war. Canada had no stakes in Afghanistan except pleasing our big daddy - the united states. And wow, did we ever pay for that subservience.\n\nSince then, our big daddy has continued to abuse us. It's not the usual abuse of forcing us to sell our raw natural resources. No, it's gotten a lot worse. Our first war deaths in decades were by American hands - friendly fire from daddy's troops. And daddy doesn't trust us anymore. He made us have passports to come in his house. He spies on us. And then he marries this guy Trump who calls us a threat to national security. Trump's buddies later say that daddy should invade us and take out our thrice-democratically elected leader.\n\nMeanwhile there's another daddy in the shadows. We can sense this new daddy is a bad boy. He abuses human rights like crazy, but daaaayumn is he rich. His means of production dwarf our old daddy's. And he's courting us. He knows our old daddy is flailing and starting to shit himself on the geopolitical stage. He sees as the world laughs at daddy's husband Trump. The new daddy's time has arrived, and this guy is 4000 years old and not about to let that opportunity pass.\n\nNew daddy China and Canada have a very Sam and Diane vibe. We fight a lot, but we're also signing more and more trade agreements that do not include the USA.\n\nThis is a long and sassy way of saying -- don't think that your military can protect you from all geopolitical threats. It didn't protect you from Russian influence or the geopolitical consequences of electing a game show host as your commander in chief.",

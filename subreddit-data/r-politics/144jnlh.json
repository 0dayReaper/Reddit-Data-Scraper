Stay safe up there.\n\nI've been thinking for a while, that just like we have NORAD for joint defense of continental airspace, it would be a good idea to have a joint, formal system for firefighting resources, better than the ad-hoc approach we use now.  Sometimes Canada has a lot of fires and the US is doing OK, and sometimes it's the other way around.  A coordinated NORAD-style fire response would let resources be pooled to focus where they are most needed. In the event that both countries have a bad fire situation at the same time, we're no worse off than before, but it could help a bunch of the time.\n\nEdit: Mexico too!",

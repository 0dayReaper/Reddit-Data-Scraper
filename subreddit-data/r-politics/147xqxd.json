If I read everything right, only 15 judges sit on the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. 3-4 are senior judges who have specific rules around case loads. 2 have reached their case load so cannot take on new cases, 1-2 are close to their load and cannot take on this case. So that takes the 15 to 11ish. \n\nOther judges are in cases and others that are at load as well. I think it pushed the selection odds to 4 judges that can hear the case and her case load pulls 50% from this district so her odds went up.",

I think she must grant a motion to recuse herself, unless she does it before a motion is even made.\nAnd the reason I say that is that she treated Trump as special, or, to put it another way, she was partial to Trump as a former President, which should not have any influence on the way this trial is conducted. I\u2019m concerned that the partiality she expressed in her decisions last year creates a reasonable perception in the mind of a fair-minded person that she is not impartial\u2014which is the test. Her behavior when she was ruling on the search-and-seizure case creates a reason to doubt her impartiality.\n\nWell said. Professor Gillers. It should be televised as well.",

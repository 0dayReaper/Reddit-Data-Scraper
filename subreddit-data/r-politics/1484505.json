But even with all he did he had to leave the White House. My guess is that he simply didn't have time to go through anything he had. He just grabbed everything and skipped town before the inauguration. Then later he was just too busy with his running around the country playing golf, rallying, fundraising, and drumming the stolen election drum to go back home and do anything with the boxes long term. It shows what a reactionary idiot he is. Think about it. A billionaire could rent an extra office somewhere, some storage units, have a custom space built out just for the stuff. A smart billionaire would hire some toadies to scan all the documents and store them offsite then destroy the paper copies. But he was too unfocused and too busy to even think any of that through. Instead it just got thrown in a room and then shuffled around later and maybe he'd pick through here or there. I'm also wondering if the document he waved around at people was even a real document or if he just threw some paper in a classified folder for effect and took that out to show his guests. It would be just the sort of slapdash BS you'd expect from a POTUS that serves his guests McDonalds. It might also explain why they can't find the document. Of course it also could have been real and stolen, or taken with DT on the plane to another location. The man is chaos incarnate so I can't put anything past him.",

He's basically a sleazy used car salesman, but in this case he's selling secrets to a bunch of foreign countries.  There's a lot of visitors from China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere that magically keep visiting his businesses, you know...because they're such awesome places to visit???  The worst part of this is the assumption that document collection was a recent event.  Everyone seems to be making the assumption that this hasn't been years of behavior.\n\nTrump succeeds because others want him to succeed.  They have a vested interest in his behavior.  He's not even good at anything.  He's just a known quantity, easy to understand and predict.  And you know exactly where his morals and interests lie.  You don't have to persuade him to do bad things.  He'll just happily do it for personal gains.  He is the textbook \"useful idiot.\"  Republicans used him.  Fox used him.  Foreign countries used him.  But equally he uses everyone else.  He grifts constantly and takes anything he can get.  The guy, despite being a moron, netted north of $8 billion dollars, yeah, with a B, through his campaigns, time in office, and general profiteering and grifting literally everyone.  The guy made bank.  He wasn't smart about.  It's just everyone else that could or should do anything were enablers, vested interests in his behavior, or simply stupider than him and gleefully handed him money.",

You could go read the indictment if you really want to know some of what's in there. It's readily available and lists the sort of docs on page 2.

Bragged about it.\n\n\nI presume you're discussing the Ukrainian prosecutor who was singled out by international anti corruption watchdogs in Europe and the u.s. and whose dismissal was demanded by the US department of state prior to the payment of financial aid. All of which was documented government policy not shady underhanded deals\n\n\nFBI informant mentioned big guy in reference to Biden while alerting of his pay to play scheme.\n\n\nI presume that you are referring to the FBI documents recently released by Jim Jordan and his weaponization committee. The FBI forms that just state \"we were told these things by this informant on this date\" and have no investigatory follow up or conclusion? I could report to the FBI that Transdontexistlol has raspberry flavored farts.  Doesn't make it true",

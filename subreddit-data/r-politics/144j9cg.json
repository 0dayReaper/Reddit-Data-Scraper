Parties should be able to enact the legislation they want when they are elected into majorities and they should be held accountable by the voters for that legislation. But, in America you have to win the house, presidency and 60 seats in the Senate all while having different election cycles in order to pass the legislation your party wants. This intentionally makes it easy to block legislation and claim 'my way or the highway'.",

Defending Trump brings in more votes for the upcoming elections and as long as it does, Republicans will preach.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for how it will play out ... they didn't think that far ahead. A problem for another day.\n\nThis reminds me of a group of guys I used to hang out with early in high school in the early 90s.\n\nWe were a small band of idiots &amp; trouble-makers.  Nothing criminal, just your run of the mill idiots.  We'd hung out together since middle school.\n\nOne day, they told me that one of their neighbors was on vacation and they were going to break into their house for fun.  They wanted me to come along.  I said \"No fucking way.\"  They called me a pussy.  Said they weren't going to \"do anything\"...it was just for fun.  I held my ground.  I might have been a jackass, but I knew that was going through a very dangerous door.\n\nThe first night, they broke in and did exactly what they said...they just went in and looked around.  I know this because they told me.  I still didn't fully believe them, thought maybe they were just bragging.\n\nThe next night, they went back...but this time they actually stole something.  Maybe it was to prove they actually went in.  I know this because they showed it to me.  That's when I decided to fully break away from this group. I told them \"You're going to get caught.  You're going to go to juvenile.  I don't want anything to do with this.\n\nOver the next couple nights, they kept going back.  They stole more things.  On the last night, they just decided to trash the house.  That's when they got caught.  Two of them ended up going to juvenile detention.  The third one got only restitution because his dad hired a lawyer.\n\nEven at 15 years old, I was able to see that there was a line.  I was able to see the path they were going down, and that I wanted no part of it.  I knew they were going to get caught.",

But he has his own baggage as he faces disbarment for contempt of court in a recent civil suit he lost.\n\nOf the ones I noticed, the only one without a clear not-hired is this guy, and sounds like Kuehne either fell through or Trump's legal team is trying to convince Trump not to hire the guy facing disbarment.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Trump has also seemingly been unable to find a specialist national security lawyer, eligible to possess a security clearance, to help him navigate the Espionage Act charges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the problem.  Looks like Trump has finally after decades of legal fast and looseness has reached the FO of FAFO.

I think it's pretty obvious. \n\nFirst of all, the lawyers need to be barred in Florida (EDIT: Someone who says they're a lawyer says this isn't true) and have top secret security clearance. so the number of viable lawyers is low. \n\nBut more importantly, his last lawyers were put on the witness stand. That only happens if there's a lot of evidence that they committed a crime too. And that they basically got caught. Either Trump fucked them really bad and put them in a position where they accidentally lied to the court, or Trump fucked them in such a way that they purposely lied to the court.\n\nThat's the line that the lawyers don't want to cross. Some lawyers will accept not getting paid and they'll accept a losing case. Being the lawyer that the ex-president chose is still a helluva feather in the cap that'll improve their brand amongst a certain group of potential clients. But being put in a position where they might get imprisoned or disbarred or forced to drop the case and testify against their client is not a feather in the cap. Hell, even if none of that happens, Trump will turn on them and say online that they were criminals and terrible lawyers if there's any part of the case that isn't going his way.\n\nIt's not just that he's guilty. He's a black hole of guilt. Everyone who sticks with him gets sucked in and ends up worse off.",

It is just not really in their best interest. And grandstanders really like their own best interest.\n\nThere is also a possibility that he is being intentionally impossible to represent as some sort of half baked plan to delay the case. It seems like something this particular judge would be amenable to, and it might survive appeal.",

It\u2019s not hyperbole to call them terrorists, that\u2019s literally what they are and what they\u2019re willing to do.",

The \u201cmilitia\u201d would then just have a straightforward gunfight and would be \u201csuccessful\u201d in forcing their demands to be met through gorilla warfare. I like how their line of magical thinking ignores the fact the US government would be fine with civilian collateral loss to preserve the nation itself. There are plenty of times the government has said \u201cfuck decorum, we\u2019ll do it our way anyway\u201d just not in a sense or scale of preserving the nation. Waco, Texas, is a prime example.\n\nEdit: yeah, I\u2019m a dipshit and didn\u2019t proofread. I\u2019m letting the L stay. Thanks for the multiple corrections.

In new data from April shared exclusively with the Guardian, researchers found a continued support for violence to achieve various political goals on both sides of the aisle, and a general distrust for democracy.\n\n\n....\n\n&gt;For the next year and a half through the 2024 election, CPOST will be releasing new survey data tracking continued dangers to democracy every three months. The data will be published first with the Guardian. This data will be critical at a time when efforts to erode democracy feel increasingly prevalent in the United States, from candidates who deny the results of their elections to governmental taskforces attempting to prosecute people who unintentionally violate voting laws.\n\nArticle continues with graphics breakdown",

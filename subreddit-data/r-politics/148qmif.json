But it would have to be fought if particular school districts, local governments and/or churches started enacting local \"laws\" or \"rules\" or pulling books from shelves.\n\nNow they know not to try it; it's against State law, and anyone who tries can get their State funding yanked.\n\n&gt;In Illinois alone, there were 67 attempts to ban books in 2022, according to the Chicago-based American Library Association (ALA), which has been tracking censorship attempts nationwide. It says the majority of books targeted were written about or by LGTBQ people or people of color.\n&gt;\n&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/148qmif/illinois_becomes_first_state_to_pass_law/ (OP link)",

So they\u2019re free to violate that all they want.\n\n\nOr they were, until the 14th amendment which says no state shall abridged the privileges of any citizen of the United States. But even then, it took years of lawsuits in which various parts of various amendments were bundled with the 14th amendment to expand the freedoms offered by the constitution in what was known as \u201cincorporation\u201d",

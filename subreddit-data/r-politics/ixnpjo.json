Yes, less than 1000, and it was the deciding state in that election.\n\nGetting 32,000 more voters in Florida is a big deal and could decide who wins down there\n\nEdit: even if none of them vote at all, I would rather they have the right to choose than to be stripped of the right to vote altogether. Even if all of them vote against my preferred candidate, I would still support their right because democracy itself is more important than any one candidate. All im saying with these numbers is that 32,000 extra voters are plenty to sway an election either way and that's important. Whoever is president next year will be the president of everyone; rich, poor, black white, man, women, lawyer, teacher, police officer, doctor, drug dealer, convict, and used car salesman. He is everyones president and everyone has the equal right to voice their choice for who that should be. I do not want to strip away anyone's rights just because I think differently than them",

Jeb bush was governor and he literally roved the voting rights of many people for felony convictions but in truth many of them had no criminal record at all. In one case even someone who was running her county election was removed from voter roles even though she had no criminal record. \n\nAnd then there was the point during the recount that Roger stone personally led a group of people into an election office to disrupt and stop a recount. He was successful which allowed enough of a delay to allow the scotus to weigh in and stop the count and give bush the presidency. \n\nThe whole thing was shady as fuck.",

They'll get you for having control of the vehicle because drunk people don't act rationally, they don't even want you to have the keys. It's the same thing in Germany when I was stationed there.

However, a lot of cops will ask you to get your keys, if you do they can arrest you (because now you have your keys, kind of like people being arrested for showing marijuana in NY when they took it out during a search which is different from possession). If you absolutely have to take a nap in your car while drunk leave your keys in the trunk and if a police office asks you anything just say you don't have your keys inside the car and you will not retrieve them. Worst they can do is public intoxication but that's rare.\n\nObviously some states are different like the above example where they gave a DUI even without keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally just take an uber or lyft if you are drunk a tow bill is cheaper than a DUI, if you are in Miami Beach you should call a private tow since their tow bill is absolutely absurd ($350+) and there is a 100% chance of getting towed lol.",

This is the second constitutional amendment that the people voted for that the GOP then spent millions of our own tax dollars to fight against.  The other one was the \"Fair Districts Act\" which was supposed to fix our horribly gerrymandered districts.

Don't stop there, Mike, keep going!\n\nJust focus on paying off the smallest outstanding fine amounts to get the most bang for your buck.\n\n____________________________\n\nEdit: As I said in a reply, I don't much care whether he pays the fines of Republicans or Democrats - democratic participation is too important a right to be stripped away on the basis of unpaid fines! \n\nEdit2: Just to note, there is no actual database showing the political affiliation of ex-felons in Florida, and, [if you believe the White House](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/517522-bloomberg-pays-fines-for-32000-felons-in-florida-so-they-can-vote), more ex-felons actual register as Republicans. Just a thought for all those thinking that this is just bribery or 'buying' democratic votes.\n\nEdit 3: I'm adding something I said deeper in the comments in reply to someone who disputed that voting was \na fundamental right because I think some may find it worthwhile.:\n\n&gt; The Supreme Court of the United States has frequently treated the right to vote as a 'fundamental right' according strict scrutiny to those regulations or statutes that hinder voters' exercise of the right. To quote the Court itself in one instance:\n\n&gt; \"Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.\" (*Reynolds v. Sims*)\n\n&gt; Congress has as well:\n\n&gt; \"The Congress finds that (1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right.\". (Voting Registration Act)\n\n&gt; And just speaking to the history of blocking voting for felons in Florida, if you look into the origins of the regulation, it was [explicitly](https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/government/2018/01/15/floridas-felon-voting-ban-dates-back-jim-crow-unfinished-business-civil-rights-movement/1032339001/) a product of the Jim Crow era designed to keep the voting power of Florida's African-American population to a minimum.",

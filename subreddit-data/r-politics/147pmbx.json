His policies are not any more drastic than a typical Republican, just more in your face. Bush passed *larger* tax cuts for the 1%\n\nThe manufacturing of Russiagate, as well as these legal cases are going to comeback on us as a nation. \n\nThis is the shit banana republics do, jailing your opponent \n\nEveryone of our presidents in the 21st century have been war criminals\u2014 but that\u2019s not their issue w Trump.\n\nThey love war criminals\u2014 it\u2019s counter-establishment people that they despise. \n\nI mean, the Biden connections to Burisma should be a national scandal \u2014 just the appearance alone, much less when you start digging into the company itself.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre to find myself on arguing in anyway for Trump, because he\u2019s a poisonous bigot \u2014 but, so was Reagan, and Biden, they\u2019re just more polished.\n\nThe FBI should not be working to subvert the voters. We keep treading closer and closer to that line. \n\nThey have a long, unbroken history of attacking the left in America. Every time a precedent is set to reign in the right (Alex Jones), it\u2019s immediately turned against the left (the dozens of copwatch and socialist-leaning organizations quietly banned along w Alex Jones).",

But yet, generations later these people's descendants wrap themselves in a flag they despise to attack our very society from its' inside, an plan that has been in motion longer than you and I have been alive. Everything awful that happened during Trump's administration was a benefit to their lost cause, a hoped-for bonus that more than delivered as far as they were concerned.\n\nFor the country to move on, he has to go to prison. For the country to heal, he has to die in it. Whether it is from old age due to a life sentence for treason, or from lethal injection due to a death sentence for treason makes no difference, he has to die in it.\n\nAnd I don't give a fuck what some South African nazi billionaire enobled by his purchased American citizenship and the right's desire to turn twitter into the next Fox News says.

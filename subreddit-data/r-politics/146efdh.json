She is like Samuel Alito. She doesn't give a damn what you think and is probably salivating to be an eternal hero to the far right. Unilaterally acquitting Trump puts her on the fast track for promotion - to the 11th circuit, Attorney General or SCOTUS. And worst case (to her) that Dems remain in power she knows that she's untouchable in her current job.\n\nKeep in mind 99% of the GOP is lambasting this trial as a corrupt overreach, political persecution, the actions of a bannana republic dictatorship. You think those same people are going to turn around and remove this Judge if she saves Trump? Hell no they are going to praise her \"bravery\" and \"integrity\".",

They are known for their \u201crocket docket\u201dand many federal judges are familiar with Trump\u2019s endless delay tactics. Including the 11th Circuit. \n\nIn his 3 minute address to the media, after unsealing the indictment, Mr Smith said 1) he has confidence in his investigative team 2) Read the indictment 3) presumption of innocence and 4) Speedy Trial.",

They aren\u2019t exactly fans of this sycophant based on earlier scathing reviews of her handling of the issues surrounding the warrant when the DOJ pushed it on appeal to the 11th.",

You know full well, she is going to slow down proceedings and do whatever she can to help Trump's defense. \n\nI can understand the frustration and outrage but I'm surprised that it comes as such a shock. For us watching on from outside the US, this is just another plot twist in the drama that is Trump. More twists and turns than any nominated show on Netflix or any of the streaming services.\n\nYou know this won't end well. Like Trump said, he literally could kill someone live on TV and this guy slips straight through the judiciary. As sad as it is, it's equally amazing. The US is absolutely fucked.",

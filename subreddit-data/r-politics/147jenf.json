Consent is obviously not a bad thing. I'm talking purely in the tactical sense: what rhetorical tactics are used to control the narrative. From that sense, this is fundamentally flawed. Looking at more recent bad faith arguments from the right to control the narrative, (things like \"Trans people are trying to groom kids\"), it's all stupid lies....but at least if it were true, \"grooming kids\" is a legitimate reason to be angered. It's easier to see where the moral outrage comes from.\n\n\"We need to protect kids!\" Ok. You're being manipulated here, but the tools of your manipulation are about protection and fear. I at least understand why you would take that side. *On the surface* (and I cannot emphasize enough how surface-level that line of reasoning is), you aren't taking a stance against trans persons, you are taking a stance against grooming children.\n \nBut how do you draw up the argument against consent? There's no \"but actually\" to fall back on, even in bad faith. \"I'm not against consent, I'm actually against......uh....\".\n\nWhat was his tactical endgame here?",

So many crimes and so many violations of court orders that it's not possible to provide a credible defense so therefore he can't be prosecuted.\n\nWINNING!  SMARTEST PERSON EVER!  \n\nI'm being foolish, of course, but it is pretty much his method for everything.  Spew out volumes of misinformation, ignorance, and fabricated nonsense in machine gun fashion that overwhelms the ability to analyze, fact check, and dispute his bullshit on such a grand scale.  Sort of a new 'truthiness.'  When everything is a lie, nothing is a lie, because \"they claim everything I say is a lie!  Witch hunt!\"\n\nSo, then the methodology becomes to commit such a volume of crimes that it overwhelms the system, and of course, then gives him the defense of \"I can't even take a dump without being charged with a crime!  Witch hunt!\"",

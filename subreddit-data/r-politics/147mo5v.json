That is deliberate destruction, and is significantly different than walking off the line of a manufacturing job. It's more akin to leaving food you are supposed to deliver asap outside of temp control, yes once it's been in the danger zone for 4 hours you have to toss it, but when you left it outside in the sun it was totally fine.\n\n&gt;You are simply not a rational person if you call it that.\n\nI'm not sure how anyone could approach a statement like that, but I'll try.\n\nThe actual ruling isn't about sabotaging the equipment, it's getting compensation for destruction of material rendered unusable by deliberate group action. Honestly the losses at material cost, compared to potentially damaging a cement truck (which the workers did not do, and the lawsuit, and SC ruling states as much) are very, VERY limited.\n\nFinally, the time and place for destruction of the means of production should be reserved for egregious offenses. Not for situations like arguing over pay/benefits IMHO.",

This is likely because Justice Amy Coney-Barrett's majority opinion served as the lesser of two evils, not directly striking down Garmon's precedent, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch argued for in their concurrence.\n\nThe liberals signing onto that opinion makes it the clear majority opinion, instead of a 3-3 split between Barret's milder interpretation and Alito/Thomas/Gorsuch's much worse one. That's not a betrayal, it's a maneuver. I would place decent odds that the three liberal justices talked and decided that they couldn't all dissent, and by whatever method decided Brown would get to be the one that does.\n\nThis sub often discusses the problems of spoilers and FPTP voting in elections. I for one am glad the justices don't have a worse understanding of voting strategy than your average Redditor.",

Thomas and Gorsuch wen further and said that they wished the court could erase Garmon.\n\nI don't see how a 6-3 would be any worse for the liberal justices or better for the conservatives. \n\nWe may see the NLRB rule that the Teamsters actually did engage in protected strike behavior and now that the court has overstepped their bound and ruled that it isn't, we've got a standoff. Do we go by the NLRB ruling because they're the federal authority on labor law, or do we go by SCOTUS because they're the highest authority on all law? Garmon was made to solve this problem! Jackson was right that the court had no authority to rule on this case until the NLRB made a decision.",

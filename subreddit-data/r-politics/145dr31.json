            "comment": "From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):\n\nThe beleaguered Massachusetts Republican Party may have a new leader, but the party\u2019s internal divisions are as apparent, and as ugly, as ever.\n\nAt a Thursday evening meeting of the Republican State Committee, a packed agenda devolved into some five hours of shouting matches and contentious debate, as the body convened for its first formal meeting in well over a year. Seemingly routine discussions over ratifying new members and approving a budget broke down into proxy battles between ideological conservatives disappointed over the ouster of former GOP Chairman Jim Lyons, and more moderate members supportive of new Chairwoman Amy Carnevale, according to several Republicans in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt was just utter chaos,\u201d said Mike Valanzola, a state committee member who has been supportive of Carnevale. \u201cLast night we spent the entire evening in circular battles on old legacy issues from the Lyons era . . . not focused on electing Republicans.\u201d\u201cThe real winner,\u201d he added, \u201cwas the Democrats.\u201d\n\nPlagued for years by internal divides, the state party has struggled with dwindling fundraising and vote share, and lost every race it ran last fall for statewide office and Congress. Carnevale was elected earlier this year on a pledge to bring the party together and turn around state Republicans\u2019 record of electoral failure. But months into her tenure, the party is still battling six-figure debts and contending with campaign finance probes from state and federal regulators.\n\nCarnevale \u2014 who brought in a parliamentarian from the Republican National Committee to ensure procedures were followed at a meeting she knew would be contentious \u2014 acknowledged that Thursday\u2019s gathering was far from smooth. But she said some Republicans needed an opportunity to air their grievances after years of internal strife. The party had not convened a formal meeting since 2021, after proceedings were disrupted by a quorum break and a boycott.",

Even the people who supported trump in my family for example still won\u2019t vote for most Republican candidates at a state level. It\u2019s quite funny to me.

When Trump first won the primary, I had hoped he would get embarrassed in the general and force the GOP to turn to a Bill Weld or a Charlie Baker. They are still conservatives but they are at least not insane assholes.",

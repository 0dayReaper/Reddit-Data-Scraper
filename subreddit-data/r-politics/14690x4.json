See, as president I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.\n\n&gt; [Staffer]: Yeah, Now we have a problem.\n\n&gt; [Trump]: Isn't that interesting?\n\nIt is hard to see any possible argument he could make in good faith in defence of that. He is on tape admitting it is classified. He is admitting he cannot declassify it. He is admitting it was a document given to him by the Defense Department. And he is (a) in possession of it, (b) showing it to a staffer, and (c) showing it to a random writer.\n\nAnd all, essentially, so he could win an argument on the Internet.\n\n\"This is secret information.

It sounds dumb but it is true.\n\nThe reason for pointing this out is simple, his cries about this being a \u201cwhich hunt\u201d to stop him from running are kinda stupid when you know that he could still run from jail. \n\nNone of that matters though because it\u2019s all over inflated bullshit masking the simple fact that trump may be the front runner, but he only has support from like 60% of the republicans, in a sea of other options\u2026 he isn\u2019t going to be gaining more specifically because he won\u2019t change - and realistically he can\u2019t change now because he\u2019s locked himself into that one approach. 2024 is alot of media coverage and campaigning away, more will be added to the other options list in the Republican Party and by the time they pick the nominee, it\u2019s either trump or someone else. Trump won\u2019t win because even by then he won\u2019t have gained more to his pool of voters - because he won\u2019t change - and the \u201csomeone else\u201d also won\u2019t have enough of a pool of voters because the trump die hards will never vote for someone else. \n\n2+2=4",

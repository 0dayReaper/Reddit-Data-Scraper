A 4% Trump Judge chance feels like it should come up 4 times out of a hundred tries. In reality, every single one of those 100 tries has a 4% chance of coming up Trump. Trump judge could come up once, never, 100 times, who knows when randomness is involved. Which is why it's an awful system to use when picking a judge.",

I\u2019m not sure why we help them downplay all the republicans that got arrested from Muellers work by repeating their talking point or help congress avoid responsibility by not reiterating that they were the ones who were supposed to force trump to consequences in the first place and were so scared of muellers work that they actually refused to discuss it _at all_ lest it make their cowardice more apparent.",

It\u2019s worth remembering that this whole \u201cmueller didn\u2019t give us what we needed to get trump convicted\u201d narrative _was a narrative republicans started_.  Because they wanted everyone believing there wasn\u2019t anything there to convict trump on.  It\u2019s just that democrats were so pissed that trump wasn\u2019t getting arrested that they went with that narrative.  If you read even a fraction of the mueller report it\u2019s blatantly obvious that that narrative isn\u2019t true.

It\u2019s possible the FBI has evidence of that, or that they could argue the egregious abuse implies lack of jeopardy. This part is just my speculation though.",

She can certainly fuck with the evidence and say it\u2019s insufficient for a conviction. I\u2019m looking at the last section in B below.\n\nhttps://www.federalrulesofcriminalprocedure.org/title-vi-trial/rule-29-motion-for-a-judgment-of-acquittal/#:~:text=After%20the%20government%20closes%20its,insufficient%20to%20sustain%20a%20conviction.\n\nRule 29. Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal\n(a) Before Submission to the Jury. After the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the defendant\u2019s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. The court may on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. If the court denies a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s evidence, the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so.\n\n(b) Reserving Decision. The court may reserve decision on the motion, proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.\n\n(c) After Jury Verdict or Discharge.\n\n(1) Time for a Motion. A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 14 days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury, whichever is later.\n\n(2) Ruling on the Motion. If the jury has returned a guilty verdict, the court may set aside the verdict and enter an acquittal. If the jury has failed to return a verdict, the court may enter a judgment of acquittal.\n\n(3) No Prior Motion Required. A defendant is not required to move for a judgment of acquittal before the court submits the case to the jury as a prerequisite for making such a motion after jury discharge.\n\n(d) Conditional Ruling on a Motion for a New Trial.\n\n(1) Motion for a New Trial. If the court enters a judgment of acquittal after a guilty verdict, the court must also conditionally determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is later vacated or reversed. The court must specify the reasons for that determination.\n\n(2) Finality. The court\u2019s order conditionally granting a motion for a new trial does not affect the finality of the judgment of acquittal.\n\n(3) Appeal.\n\n(A) Grant of a Motion for a New Trial. If the court conditionally grants a motion for a new trial and an appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal, the trial court must proceed with the new trial unless the appellate court orders otherwise.\n\n(B) Denial of a Motion for a New Trial. If the court conditionally denies a motion for a new trial, an appellee may assert that the denial was erroneous. If the appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal, the trial court must proceed as the appellate court directs.",

We don't often have such rampant corruption in the justice system because we've never before had such a rampantly corrupt person nominating judges.\n\nDid DOJ have a choice to empanel the grand jury in a different district or did it have to be there because that's where he broke the law?\n\nIf DOJ files tomorrow to have her removed from the case, won't it just be more delay because they'll appeal and appeal and appeal?\n\nCan she just flatly dismiss the case? If she does, can an appellate court overrule her again?",

Let me quote from their response:\n\n&gt;This appeal requires us to consider whether the district court had jurisdiction to block the United States from using lawfully seized records in a criminal investigation. The answer is no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In considering these arguments, we are faced with a choice: apply our usual test; **drastically expand the availability of equitable jurisdiction for every subject of a search warrant; or carve out an unprecedented exception in our law for former presidents**. We choose the first option. So the case must be dismissed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The district court\u2019s unsupported conclusion that government possession of seized evidence creates an \u201cunquantifiable\u201d risk of public disclosure is not enough to show that Plaintiff faces irreparable harm.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The district court was undeterred by this lack of information.** It said that \u201cbased on the volume and nature of the seized material, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has an interest in and need for at least a portion of it,\u201d though it cited only the government\u2019s filings and not Plaintiff\u2019s. But that is not enough. Courts that have authorized equitable jurisdiction have emphasized the importance of identifying \u201cspecific\u201d documents and explaining the harm from their \u201cseizure and retention.\u201d See, e.g., Harbor Healthcare Sys., L.P. v. United States, 5 F.4th 593, 600 (5th Cir. 2021) (Harbor did \u201cfar more than assert vague allegations\u201d by pointing to \u201cthousands\u201d of privileged documents that the government retained for four years). **Neither the district court nor Plaintiff has offered such specifics.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Now, with the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Plaintiff\u2019s initial motion or to issue any orders in response to it.**\n\nIn bluntness, Cannon's opinion was frankly absurd from the start and utterly nonsensical, as the 11^(th) Circuit rightly concluded. To reach the conclusion she did required her to ignore multiple valid tests and rules of law, practically bending over at the waist to accommodate a request for a Special Master *when Donald Trump had not even been charged at the time.* As such, whether she is capable of judging without prejudice a very similar case would seem to be apparent: she cannot in fact conduct such judicial oversight without similar contortions of law to reach conclusions Donald Trump finds more favorable. Consequently, she is unlikely to ensure a fair trial.",

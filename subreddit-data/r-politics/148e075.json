And this is why they will stick with him to the very end, grasping at any excuse to minimize or justify his actions...because in their minds, if he is proven wrong about one thing, then *everything else is up for debate.*\n\nThey do not want to give up what trump gave them: the ability to openly hate.",

When people say shit like this I can tell they don\u2019t actually know too many people like this in real life. \n\nYou know how we all know that the Durham report, or this current whistleblower thing about Biden/Burisma, or Tara Reade\u2019s allegations are political hatchet jobs just meant to discredit Biden and make Trump look good? That\u2019s exactly how a lot of republican voters view anything damning against Trump. Because their media ecosystem is full of people screaming from the rooftops that these things are fundamentally illegitimate. Their politicians and their media are behaving exactly the way you\u2019d expect them to if the DOJ was being weaponized to target Trump, and that\u2019s the first message these voters here anytime something happens. \n\nSure, there are tons of elected officials and people in right wing media who know this stuff is true and are just openly lying because they think it helps their cause. And there are plenty of voters who don\u2019t care if the charges are true because they think Hillary did the same thing and they just want Trump to own the libs. But there are also a ton of voters who won\u2019t bother to read the indictment bc the talking heads on tv are screaming up and down that it\u2019s a witch-hunt, and so that\u2019s what they believe and they don\u2019t see much value in reading the indictment, the same way that I don\u2019t need to read the Durham Report page by page.\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is like saying that anybody who endorsed/voted for Biden doesn\u2019t care that he sexually assaulted Tara Reade; when in reality most people did so because they (rightly) didn\u2019t find her allegations credible, not because they were openly cool with voting for a sex offender. \n\nThe same thing applies to plenty of Republican voters, the difference is that they have a fuck ton of politicians/media lying to their face about everything. \n\nThe sad truth is that the same way we would immediately discredit most of what comes out of Jim Jordan or Ted Cruz\u2019s mouth, that\u2019s what a lot of GOP voters have been conditioned to do when they hear literally anything reported in mainstream media.",

Going to copy this comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12ajvog/jim_jordan_vows_to_defund_the_police_over_donald/jeschae/).  Full text below.\n\nConservativism has exactly one priority: self.  It is egocentrism in the guise of stoic protection of the status quo.  This becomes obvious the very moment a conservative does not benefit from the status quo, and they wish to change the world to improve their own standing in it.\n\nThere is no hypocrisy in conservativism because there is no objective standard or ideology beyond protecting and promoting the self, and the self is whatever conservatives decide exists within the self.  The self is good, and the other is bad.  Everything else is negotiable.  \n\nTo someone who is not conservative, this looks like hypocrisy.  See: The only Moral Abortion is My Abortion, or The Card Says Moops, or Gun Control for Black Panthers, or My Daughter is a LGBTQ+ so now LGBTQ+ are People, or It isn't \"Drag\" when I do it, or But my state *deserves* FEMA Funding, or Regulate this industry because it is a threat to me, or My sex scandal is a private matter so please respect my privacy, or Election fraud exists and I'll prove it, or I'm a job creator so please bail me out, or just take literally any conservative talking point and you will find conservatives who are suddenly the exception to their own rule.  \n\nThat's the feature of conservativism that is so appealing.  It's like having a personal God that will forgive any transgression as long as you believe and pray for forgiveness.  Being part of the self is like a warm blanket, and as long as you agree to maintain the farce, you get to stay under its protection.  \n\nThis isn't new information.  Conservatives have always existed, under different banners and with different definitions of the self.  Trump has laid bare the grift, abusing it past the point of credibility.  That's his hold, that to oust Trump is to abandon the ruse, and conservatives can't do that.  That's why they will try very hard to make him a member of the Other.  They will claim they were duped, that he was a secret Democrat, that he was never one of them.  But he was always one of them, even when he was a Democrat.",

This isn't the same as \"being brainwashed.\"  For the most part, they actually do know the difference between their fantasy and reality, it's just that to an authoritarian follower, the tribal fantasy is more important.     \n\n\nAnd that's why right-wingers will commit genocide. By their nature, they separate what they \"believe\" from what they do.  If the tribe tells them to commit genocide against the trans community, that's fine, they'll commit genocide against the trans community.  They don't *personally* hold any animosity toward trans people, so they're not responsible for the harm.  It's not *actions* that make one a bigot, you see, it's *hate.*   \n\n\nDespite it being scientifically proven they can in fact tell fantasy from reality, they also *genuinely believe* their own bullshit at any given moment.  This isn't contradictory, it's all part of the same thing.  They can tell fantasy from reality when they have an incentive to do so.  *Belief* itself is part of the fantasy.   This is, I suspect, why liberals are so bad at understanding authoritarians.  The nature of belief is different to authoritarians. Sure, get one to be serious, convince one that you're part of their tribe, give them a real incentive to be honest, and they'll usually be as truthful as anyone else.  But absent those factors?  They can and will genuinely believe anything they or their tribal leaders want them to genuinely believe.",

I don\u2019t understand how people don\u2019t get this isn\u2019t a job about sitting in a chair for 8 hours a day in session. The majority of the job takes place outside of session and don\u2019t forget these people represent populations outside the Capitol. \n\nWhen are they supposed to actually live in their state/district or be around their constituents if they\u2019re in session 9-5 5 days per week every week? When aren\u2019t they supposed to actually go over or write legislation? Make negotiations? Do literally anything involving their job other than cast their vote for or against?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, many of our current legislative branch is dysfunctional. Recesses of the legislative session are not remotely the issue with it though. It\u2019s the increasingly polarizing party system and willful ignorance of the population to be engaged with the system voting down party lines rather than on policy or the person.",

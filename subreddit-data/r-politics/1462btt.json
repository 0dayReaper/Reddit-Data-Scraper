It's not quite clear whether his attorneys broke the law (besides Trump Attorney #3, obviously), but the evidence against Trump and Nauta is overwhelming.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the nature of the evidence. I assumed much of it would be witness testimony, and the right wing media would just have to discredit the witnesses to defend Trump in the court of public opinion. That mostly was not the case - only count 32 (which is mostly based on statements he made to his lawyers and Nauta) depends heavily on any witness testimony. \n\n(The incident with the PAC representative also seems like it could rely on witness testimony, but it happened in Bedminster and isn't part of these charges.)\n\nMost of the evidence is rather concrete - photos, audio recording, surveillance footage, and text messages.\n\nIt sort of ended on a cliff hanger with the unknown fate of the boxes that were loaded into the jet, and it seems like there is a strong possibility of a separate indictment in Bedminster.\n\nIt baffles me that the media strategy of repeating Trump's claim that this is hoax and blathering about how unprecedented this is could work on anyone. I guess it shows how far gone much of the country is. The evidence here is undeniable, and no one is even disputing that he retained the documents, but people are falling in line and obeying instructions on what they're told to think and believe.",

This \"attorney-client privilege\" usually keeps conversations between a lawyer and their client private. Because this decision was made and is considered a \"final judgment,\" it is now \"res judicata.\" That's a legal term meaning \"a matter already judged,\" and it prevents the same issue from being brought up and argued again in another lawsuit. So, in simple terms, the decision that there was no attorney-client privilege can't be questioned or reargued in future cases.\n\nEdit: I parsed the original from the comment above text to get a laymen\u2019s version in \u201cplain English\u201d",

It is an order which was appealed on an interlocutory basis to the D.C. Cir. which he lost (thus far). He is very likely precluded from a viable argument in that forum, but he absolutely can, and likely will, raise the same arguments in other fora on this point.   Similarly, if a final judgment is reached in the criminal case in D.C., assuming an indictment issues and he is convicted, he can, and absolutely will, argue that decision was erroneous in connection with any post trial motion as well as in direct appeal and to the Supreme Court, assuming he seeks certiorari review.  As such, I would call it neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel; at this point it's more like losing a discovery order.",

It's supposed to be for a check against political prisoners and to allow a president to act in good faith to release a convict who they believe either shouldn't be punished the way they are, or that the law should be changed because of its scope or application. While I do feel that they are very rarely a good thing, allowing it unchecked is basically tantamount to saying as long as you do it for the president, you're never going to be held to account for anything.\n\nNixon should have rotted in prison, we wouldn't be where we are today if he hadn't been treated like a child that took a cookie from the jar. \n\nWhy is it always Republicans doing this, by the way? Preventative pardons, I mean. Why can't Republicans just stop doing crime so bad that the president has to write them a get out of jail free card so fucking often?

And if they end up doing that and winning enough, that is a way to get her removed from the case.     \n\nShe really doesn't have to \"Clear Trump from trial\" (I'm not a hundred percent sure what you mean there).    \n\nShe just needs the trial to actually start with a jury.   Once that happens, there are dozens of options to end the case.  And because of double jeopardy, Trump could never be charged again.",

So they go along with the lies, regardless of the immnense damage it's caused and will continue to cause on the country. \n\nIn the end, all these p.o.s. will ever care about is themselves, which is basically the description of Republican/conservative voters: it's all about me, myself and I, and fuck everyone else, *especially if you're not white*.",

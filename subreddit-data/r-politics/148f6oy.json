BULLSHIT. They have every i dotted and t crossed. It is entirely damning and even though we need to presume innocence until proven guilty, there is zero doubt that Trump did what is stated and is going down for his crimes against *all* of us in America. He clearly stole and concealed highly classified documents he had no right to have.\n\nIf any Trump supporter reads it, they will come to the same conclusion.\n\nTrump is 100% fucked.",

There was also voluminous press coverage of the fact that cuts to social safety net programs were being pushed *entirely* by Republicans, Biden made many efforts to reduce these cuts by as much as possible, and that there would be dire consequences to the entire country or even world (excepting maybe the ultra-wealthy) if the plan to avoid defaulting on the debt were not approved on a tight timeline. \n\nSo, yes, in divided government, one can sometimes blame unsavory choices on one party even if the other party ultimately approved that decision\u2014especially when it was publicly declared that the the negotiating party was \u201cholding the country hostage.\u201d\n\nYou are, I\u2019ll admit, correct that the Democratic (at the time) Congress neglected to extend funding for the additional benefits that were put in place during the National Emergency. Personally, I think our social safety net programs should be funded at exponentially higher rates than they are. But let\u2019s also keep in mind that the Democrats (at the time) only \u201ccontrolled\u201d the Senate because the VP could break tied votes. If even one member (Manchin or Sinema who has since become an independent) said they wouldn\u2019t vote to extend the benefits than that bill would have been DOA. \n\nSo, again, let\u2019s look at the context and nuance when we analyze and criticize. \n\nAnd, once more for the people in the back who slept through the Civics classes cut from American curricula decades ago: no benefits were \u201cput in place by a Republican President.\u201d Congress allocates funding. Congress writes and passes bills. The President simply says \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and then determines how to implement the laws enacted by Congress. The President is head of the Executive Branch which *executes* the legislation passed by the Legislative Branch.",

Trump was able to do that because\u2014*again*\u2014as head of the Executive Branch, he gets to choose how the relevant agencies will execute the requirements of a law passed by the Legislative Branch.\n\nCongress votes on a bill that says \u201cWe will send $1200 to every tax-paying American citizen\u201d and the Executive Branch (led by the POTUS) decides *how* to implement that directive.\n\nWhat is so hard about this?",

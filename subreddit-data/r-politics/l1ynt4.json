The actions from Trump and his administration have not just \"attempted\" to kill hundreds of thousands of people, they actually have.\n\nEdit: still other people wiser than I have pointed out that WWII era Germany did not kill every Jewish person on Earth but everyone acknowledges that they still committed genocide. So in that sense whether or not you call it genocide does not necessarily depend upon how many people are killed, but rather up on how targeted and specific it was.",

However, many publications and experts all agreed that number was the initial roll out, and not going to be sustainable under current policy, we wouldn't reach that 100m mark 100 days from now. Biden's policies are to try and get that accomplished, but more so, this also reflects some accountability. Biden is saying \"I'm aiming to have X by Y\" which is something Trump rarely, if ever, did, because that would mean people could hold him accountable. All Trump would do is say shit like \"we'll have great news in 3 weeks\", would never say what that would be, and typically, 3 weeks would come and go without word",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not because you affiliate with a party, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s when you affiliate and agree with racist policies concocted by its leader.  I would never unfriend someone who was from an opposing political party that\u2019s insane, but when words a policies demonstrate racism and fascism and you not only agree but promote them, then you\u2019re bat shit crazy too.",

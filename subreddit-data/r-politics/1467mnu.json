How does a politician win a seat when a vast majority of voters are already their party?  They go so extreme and bash the other candidates in their party for being \"not real\" party members.  We end up with politicians that are basically caricatures of their parties.\n\nIf politicians had to win votes from both parties' voters to get elected, I'd like to believe they'd be a lot more calm with their rhetoric.",

Here in australia a bunch of people decided they didn't like our main conservative party but didn't want to vote for our centre leftist party instead they voted for independents who managed to steal a bunch of seats from.thw conservatives. In a 2 party system with first past the post ita unlikely this would happen. We still have 2 main parties but have independents and minor parties who in the senate especially get some representation",

Even when voting in primaries it feels like you have to vote strategically, predicting who is most likely to win so you don\u2019t end up \u201cthrowing away your vote.\u201d When really you prefer some in-the-middle guy but polling shows they don\u2019t have a fart\u2019s chance in hell, so you\u2019re afraid to deny another \u201cless good option\u201d of your vote lest it gives the advantage to \u201cworst-case option.\u201d \n\nI voted for Hillary in 2016, but I didn\u2019t like her hardly at all. But I wasn\u2019t going to vote for trump if my life depended on it. Then again last year. I don\u2019t totally dislike Biden, but he\u2019s far too old now and I think we needed someone else, but again I wasn\u2019t voting for trump. Now I\u2019m REALLY unhappy with Biden, being that he\u2019s fucking 80, but again I won\u2019t have an option. Most like the only other choice will be trump or desantis. So\u2026. Great illusion of choice &lt;_&lt; \n\nIn my mind at least, ranked voting would eliminate this problem. But it would mean these career politicians would be at risk of losing their guaranteed position so that\u2019s never gonna happen. And it pisses me off.",

Hell in the senate I voted for, the greens, the socialist alliance, animal justice party, a progressive independent and then put my 5th choice as our centre leftish major party.

Places that have these committees have requirements for balancing the committee based on political affiliation to be as close to fair as possible (of course this is under the belief that equal representation of each party is fair representation, which while I have problems with that it's definitely far better than what many states are doing right now).",

(Solar tech has improved immensely since the early 2000s, as has battery storage.)\n\n\nObama talked about changing US policy like steering a cruise ship. If we could have gotten renewable energy moving forward sooner, we\u2019d be in a better place today.\n\n\nThe issue with renewable energy and environmental causes is the ability to sell them to the public and Gore wasn\u2019t exactly a dynamic orator.\n\n\nI think of it like single-payer healthcare. Politicians talk about SPHC as a great way to help Americans lower their healthcare costs (which most centrist voters don\u2019t really believe). But they never talk about how SPHC can help small businesses grow while being more competitive for quality employees against big businesses. If businesses don\u2019t have to deal with healthcare administration, that\u2019s a HUGE weight off of the shoulders of a company under 100 employees. Then those companies can just compete on compensation, employees can more freely move roles, capitalism becomes more efficient and competitive which lowers prices for consumers.\n\n\nThe benefits are so numerous, but democrats and progressives sell it with the enthusiasm of a coffin salesman.",

There were 4 non-Santos seats won by GOP by less than 5%. \n\nThat right there is the house majority. \n\nWith that said, the 15D-11R map is fairly representative of the NY electorate. 15-11 ends up being a 57-43 split. Schumer won his statewide election 56-43. Hochul won her governorship 53-47. \n\nSo on one hand, it accurately represents NY\u2019s electorate in congress. On the other, it was a huge missed opportunity to have a trifecta for the second half of the presidential term and get actual legislation passed on a national level",

Now they just openly run on a \"fuck you\" platform ignorant of the truth and then gaslight voters for believing the truth. I don't see that paying off for them.",

The Ohio gerrymander was a violation of state law (Ohio passed a constitutional amendment basically outlawing partisan gerrymandering, but preventing the courts from imposing maps, so the GOP exploited that by running out the clock). There is no federal law against partisan gerrymandering (yet), only racial gerrymandering. The AL map was a violation of the federal voting rights act. So this precedent will not help Ohioans. \n\nHOWEVER activists in OH are working to put a measure on the ballot to close the loopholes that the republicans used, and in response the republicans are trying to raise the threshold for ballot initiatives, because they know they will lose a fair vote on gerrymandering (and on abortion which will also be on the ballot).",

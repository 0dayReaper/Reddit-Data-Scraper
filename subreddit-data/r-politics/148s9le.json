The crowd he mustered today is not up to his usual standards.  \n  \nCompare it to either of his prior election campaigns or even Jan 6th.  His mobs once smashed their way into the Capitol Building.  This crowd couldn't even smash their way into an abandoned meth lab.",

Trump, SCOTUS, gerrymandering, dark money\u2026 all this shit is because the GOP is and has been dying for decades. They know it and instead of doing anything that actually benefits the public at large, they continue to try to get one more grift in. Which is not to say the Democratic Party is without huge problems. As long as the right runs off of a base of \u201cpunching down\u201d the growing disparity in the classes will naturally fuel a hard rejection of the right (but not necessarily an embrace of the left)\u2026 in other words they\u2019ve become toxic by design and they know that fighting dirty and lying is the only chance to keep the scam alive.",

But in terms of the GOP primary, I think being soft on Trump will also kill the campaign of his potential opponents. I know the candidates all have highly paid consultants telling them they have to somehow walk the line between making a case against Trump and not offending his supporters, and that makes sense I guess, but it ignores what Republican voters actually want. If DeSantis, who had real momentum before he actually joined the race, came out and said Trump is a weak moron who was too incompetent to do anything with the power he was given, and just relentlessly hammered him for being sloppy and stupid enough to get himself indicted, he might actually have a chance to win. I could easily see a ton of Trump supporters flipping and suddenly pretending they\u2019ve hated Trump this whole time. Again, this is the Republican primary process, logic doesn\u2019t apply. But any perceived weaknesses will doom a campaign, and not going after Trump is weak as fuck.",

Dems need to welcome the chance, as it\u2019s their best option, to run again Trump. \n\nDems should let Trump get whatever criminal punishment awaits and leave it at that. Nothing legally says he cannot run with a conviction or from jail is what the Dems should stick to. Force the Republicans to move to boot him or enjoy running against an easy target. \n\nRepublicans don\u2019t want Trump but they don\u2019t want to speak out against him. Dems should not play the patsy for the Republicans.",

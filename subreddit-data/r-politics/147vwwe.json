The question referenced images included in the Justice Department\u2019s indictment of former president Donald Trump that show he had stored boxes in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom.   \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d McCarthy responded. \u201cIs it a good picture to have boxes in a garage that opens up all the time? A bathroom door locks.\u201d  \nMcCarthy is referring to the ongoing investigation into documents uncovered at President Biden\u2019s Delaware residence, some of which were stored in the president\u2019s garage.   \n\u201c\\[You\\] have a lot of these documents behind a Corvette in a garage with the door wide open,\u201d McCarthy added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a son of, Hunter Biden, who knows who he had there, in and out.\u201d",

Meanwhile \"the stupid clause\" allows for those who were inept, made a mistake and fully cooperated.  The key here is intent.  The law deliberately mentions \"willfully\".  Therefore they have to prove willful intent.  With Trump they have plenty of evidence.  The others who have been charged under this same law also had willful intent.  Those who have not been prosecuted under this law were not prosecuted because they did NOT act willfully and they fully cooperated.\n\nNot only did Trump not cooperate, he lied, hid the documents, lied again, and when that failed claimed to be the victim of a witchhunt.  He wouldn't be in this mess at all had he just given everything he had back to the US government when they asked him to.\n\nEdited to add clarity to why I refer to it as the \"stupid clause\".",

Then he willfully lied to the FBI and then willfully lied some more about the types, locations and his ability to keep said documents.  He also willfully showed them to people who lacked the clearance to view them.  At every single step he willfully chose to do what he did.

I detest corruption and incompetence from any and all who have been elected to represent our country. The fight isn't Dems vs Republicans - it's corrupt scum politicians vs. the American people. \n\nWhy are US politicians are millionaires?  Their govt. job salaries are not that high - where is the money coming from? It's a sad joke.  \n\nAnyone who puts a politician on a pedestal is a fool.

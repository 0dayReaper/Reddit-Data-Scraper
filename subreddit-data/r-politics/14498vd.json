            "comment": "&gt; The \u201cDeSantis War Room\u201d Twitter account was launched last August by DeSantis\u2019 political aide Christina Pushaw, and its use of AI shows the increasing normalization of deepfakes in US politics. Earlier this year, Donald Trump shared an AI-created image of him praying as well as an audio deepfake mocking DeSantis\u2019 campaign launch on Twitter. After Joe Biden announced he would be running for re-election in 2024, the RNC published an attack ad that also featured AI-generated imagery. \n\nLeave it to the Republican party to dive headfirst into using AI technology ASAP to mislead the public.",

Imagine if Trump's \"grab 'em by the pussy\" tape came out today, a big part of the discourse would be whether the recording was real or AI generated. The \"fake news\" accusation is already an awful, disingenuous, and dangerous part of the public discourse, and will be made much worse because now they'll say it's all AI.\n\nBut in order for this to work, there has to be actual instances of this happening. This is the first egregious example I've seen, but I'm willing to bet it will become incredibly common in campaigns to use audio and images that are not real to attack political opponents, especially from those who are quick to complain about fake news.\n\nGet ready, because the people that will be using AI generated media as disinformation will be the exact same people that will accuse real media as AI generated disinformation.",

So there's that whole Bible verse warning to not be a hypocrite who prays in public just in order to be seen praying, but he's taking it a step further by instead showing a fake image of him doing it because he couldn't stand the thought of showing deference to anyone or anything.\n\nReminds me of that time when he was asked whether he's ever asked God for forgiveness for his sins and he said no, and that he shouldn't have to ask forgiveness when he doesn't make mistakes. Yet for some reason the diehard Evangelicals who see him as God's Chosen thought Obama was the Antichrist.",

If not, we're not going to be able to use this as a widespread validation method.\n\nSince replacing all cameras isn't feasible, are you suggesting that we only accept visual media that's been taken by the well-funded sorts that can afford these fancy new cameras?  That's going to have quite the ripple effect next time we have cellphone footage of someone with a cop kneeling on their neck.  \n\nDo you really think that NOBODY could fake the kind of authentication that you're talking about?  I've already seen Stable Diffusion models made to produce depth maps instead of traditional images. I'd need some sort of proof that said authentication is actually reliable vs deepfakery.\n\nLastly, even if the method does work, how do you expect the average layperson to be able to verify and trust this.  It seems to me that this is a high-tech enough answer that lots of common people would still need to rely on some sort of expert to explain or authenticate the results..

More people died in August 2021 when the Delta wave first hit Florida than any other time in the US during the pandemic, with the exception of the first month in New York. \n\nI work in health data and let me just say it was the absolute worst time. My hospital was one of about 3 that didn't go on complete diversion and we were close to the point of creating a panel to decide who lives and who dies. I can't speak for other hospitals, but considering the majority were on full diversion, I'd imagine they did have death panels at some point.\n\nNow my hospital is under attack and we just had three crazies from the \"Health Freedom\" group get elected to the county health board and have 5 seats up for grabs next year. Add to it Michael Flynn is working with them to make our hospital go private. There are only 2 public hospitals in Florida with an elected board.",

In other words, he advocated for personal sacrifices (i.e. inconveniences) to save lives, and we know conservatives *hate* that.\n\nFauci didn't go along with Trump's initial narrative that covid was going to be over in a couple of months and that you didn't need a mask. So an adviser going against Dear Leader in an election year, telling people they'll have to be inconvenienced in order to save lives, and Trump feeling forced to share the spotlight with someone clearly more knowledgeable than him were enough to make Fauci GOP enemy #1.",

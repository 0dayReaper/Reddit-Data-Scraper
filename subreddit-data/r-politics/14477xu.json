It\u2019s very awkward to \u2018preacher pause\u2019 the word \u2018woke\u2019 for emotional emphasis. Where 9/11 is perfection. \n\nFor example: \u201cThey attacked our lives, our peaceful nation, our mom\u2019s and dads, even our God\u2026 on Nine [long preacher pause] Eleven\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s important because their voters have been trained by churches to listen for this pause and react emotionally.\n\nThe word \u2018woke\u2019 couldn\u2019t be a worse choice. It needs to be said quickly because it has a hard consonant sound at they end. Drawing it out sounds goofy, and stacking it over and over in a speech is tiring to hear and makes for laughable sound bites.",

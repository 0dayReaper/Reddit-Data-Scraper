            "comment": "The headline is nonsense and doesn't really match the article, which was quite a bit more interesting than the headline implies. \n\nFundamentally the article is examining two world views surrounding the culture war. \n\nOne is the activist conservative view that cultural acceptance of LGBTQ identity is a product of the apparent embrace of major institutions. They think people see advertising for LGBTQ products in a Target, or Pride clubs at a university, and that it's in our nature to conform with the group and accept what appears to be accepted. They're trying to be much louder about being anti-LGBTQ now both as a means of disrupting the sense that there's a consensus, and because they think progressive activists will keep moving from one cause to the next, and that they are preventing some imagined next thing with all of this.\n\n(That last part is where the original title is coming from, with people who were told they were making a slippery slope argument 20 years ago in the Bush administration are saying now that the slope was pretty slippery after all, with how much LGBTQ acceptance has increased, but it's largely irrelevant to the rest of the article).\n\nThey contrast this with a set of studies that show that what appears to have actually happened is more of a snowball effect - that the biggest predictor of LGBTQ acceptance was knowing/being regularly exposed to someone from the community who is \"out\". As acceptance increased, more people came out, and acceptance increased faster.\n\nWhat's interesting is that these views aren't mutually exclusive, but might actually say the same thing in different ways: that LGBTQ rights are self sustaining, and that discrimination can only be maintained if it's harsh enough and loud enough to keep all but the most confident of us in the closet.",

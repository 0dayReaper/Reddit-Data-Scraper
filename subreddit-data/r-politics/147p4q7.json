Then take to twitter and yelp repeating all the claims without offering a shred of evidence or backstory - everyone on the outside would objectively see that as some lunatic who shits on the floor once the evidence is released. \n\nIt's insane to me that it's not the same GOP and their supporters - it's like that Ron White bit about his dog shitting in the house, they're pretending everything is fine and normal - putting a little napkin over the most recent turd while ignoring how badly the house smells.",

Folks with this mental illness need a false narrative to cling to for self protection.\n\nWhile grandiose in its application, these fantasies are there to reinforce his fragile self esteem: he is safe, he is in control. Yet, every false statement reveals more if you scratch the surface.\n\nWhen you see unhinged, false personal attacks this is normally a sign that Trump is terrified of that person. In this case, Smith and the indictments.\n\nWhat we maybe witnessing: trumps use of bandwagon fallacy, where he himself (or a small group) feel or think a certain way. If the individual projecting this fallacy has a limited world view they may consciously or unconsciously, believe it to be true.\n\nThe bandwagon fallacy is also sometimes called the appeal to common belief or appeal to the masses because it's all about getting people to do or think something because \u201ceveryone else is doing it\u201d or \u201ceverything else thinks this.\u201d\n\nBy using this fallacy trump is attempting to build the walls of fantasy back up. As his only empathy is for self his worldview only includes him. So this projection maybe an admission.",

Unfortunately I\u2019ve known some people with diagnosed personality disorders and their lives are somewhat like this but on a smaller scale. \n\nIt\u2019s like, someone\u2019s on probation, is a suspect in another case, has no car, can\u2019t hold a job, lies constantly, is a department store kleptomaniac, gambles all their money and exclusively dates/sleeps with other people whose lives and criminal records are as destroyed as theirs. But they think everyones out to get them!?! \n\nThe difference between Trump and these people I\u2019ve known is that they all have serious drug and alcohol problems throughout their lives, and none were born into the kind of wealth he had. Some were born middle class, but never Trump rich. It\u2019s interesting to me that Trump\u2019s brother was a terrible alcoholic and died from it but Trump claims to have never tried it. I almost believe him. I know that kind of thing runs in families. I\u2019ve wondered if Trump is what you get when someone who\u2019s extremely prone to severe alcoholism/addiction never tries it, but the underlying personality disorder is still there, because most addicts I know share traits with him.",

Then Jack dropped the whole indictment and made his point.\n\nThis is the same thing again. The Indictment is dropped and it's harsh, but solidly backed up with facts. TFG and GQP have done nothing all weekend except make threats against the DOJ, FBI, Biden, and Jack Smith's family. Jack Smith has all the ammo he needs to walk into court tomorrow and demand no bail be granted at all.... that's standard in espionage cases... let alone that the suspect has openly threatened his family. Even Judge Cannon is gonna have a hard time justifying anything but a fairly harsh pre-trial restrictions... Jack is gonna lead with \"no bail\" and he'll probably easily get \"\"house arrest with monitoring\".  Jack is three steps ahead of the GQP crazy train.",

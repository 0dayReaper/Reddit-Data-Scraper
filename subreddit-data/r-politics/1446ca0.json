These laws are anti-democratic and the work of cowards.\n\n&gt;Legislators in 38 states have introduced nearly 200 bills this year that would allow state governments to \"subvert\" elections, according to a report by three nonpartisan groups tracking such bills.\n\n&gt;The analysis by the States United Democracy Center, Protect Democracy and Law Forward found that legislators \u2014 predominantly Republicans \u2014 put forward 185 bills in their state legislative sessions from Jan. 1 through May 3 that would increase the risk of subversion by politicizing, criminalizing or interfering with elections.\n\n&gt;That number is on pace with those from sessions in the past two years, which the groups also tracked. Fifteen of the bills introduced this year have so far been enacted.\n\n&gt;NBC News obtained the report ahead of its public release Thursday morning.\n\n.....\n\n&gt;The analysis defined election subversion as the result of any bill that proposed one of five actions: usurping control over election results, requiring partisan or unprofessional election audits or reviews of results, seizing power over election responsibilities, creating unworkable burdens in election administration or imposing disproportionate criminal or other penalties. \n\n&gt;\u201cLegislators are trying to make it harder for trusted election officials to do their jobs, and easier for partisan politicians to overturn the will of the voters. While many may think this threat abated after the midterms, it most certainly did not,\u201d Maya Ingram, a senior policy development counsel at the States United Democracy Center, said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cIn fact, legislators are coming up with new ways to interfere with elections.\u201d\n\narticle continues....",

He basically rallied the entire party around himself, both crazies and establishment republicans. He created the MAGA movement, which has poisoned this country to its core.\n\nRemember that republicans are the main enemy, yes. But don\u2019t forget that trump single-handedly destroyed our nation\u2019s reputation and international prestige, severely damaged our alliances, downplayed a global pandemic and even brought up an idea of injecting bleach to combat covid. Then before he left office he tried to get his dumbass voters to keep him in power. This is shit that goes beyond the Republican Party. He is a god damn idiot that sees the presidency as the only way to avoid jail for all the shit he did and he\u2019ll probably do whatever he can to get it.\n\nVote every Republican out yes, but let\u2019s not delude ourselves into thinking trump isn\u2019t the main threat here. He\u2019ll run for president even from a cell if he has to, and it\u2019s not like his voters would care.",

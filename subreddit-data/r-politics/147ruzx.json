I\u2019m a lawyer and besides the fact that I hate Trump, my other main I\u2019d never want to represent him is bc he\u2019d be a liability to my attorney\u2019s license. \n\nIn Florida, it is a crime for an attorney to knowingly alllow his client to commit perjury under oath or to provide false evidence. If a lawyer knows his client is planning to commit perjury, the lawyer is required to withdraw from representating the client and tell the court that the client is planning to commit perjury.  [Source.](https://www.floridabar.org/etopinions/opinion-04-1/).\n\nTrump will surely insist on lying. I\u2019d be afraid the judge would think I knowingly helped him lie and that would end my career. Or just as bad that if I know he was going to lie so I\u2019d have to rat him out to the court and he\u2019d send his little army out to ruin my life or kill me in retaliation. \n\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll eventually find someone to represent him, but good attorneys hate representing clients like him who won\u2019t take our advice bc they think they can do whatever they want. It\u2019s just too risky.",

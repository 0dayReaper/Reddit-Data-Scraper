Once you\u2019ve thoroughly demonstrated their arguments are bullshit, instead of examining their ideology, requiring they experience a mournful period of self reflection, self doubt, self discovery and experience sadness, embarrassment, loneliness, victimization\u2026 etc \u2026 instead of processing any of that and growing as a person, they find it much easier to double down and take it personally so they feel justified jumping to the only emotion they understand other than horney\u2026 they jump to anger. Angry they can\u2019t just force the world to work in a way which it ought to, according to themselves. \n  \nAnger is impotant though, causing the person distress as it seethes and humiliates, stewing inside. Unfortunately once they realize their anger is as impotant as their ideology, they feel a justification in threatening or using physical violence/force. This intimidates people forcing them into a situation where they shut up, or they\u2019re beaten into  submission, both results convenient for the idiots because now they don\u2019t suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, and they feel happiness from their power trip, reinforcing the behavior.\n  \nThe same kind of people who never apologize for anything, and always shift blame back to the person they\u2019ve wronged.  \nThey\u2019re also not curious or empathetic people who never ask honest questions \u2026 They are only interested in the world if they get to shape the rules and how they belong and are perceived by others within their version of it. Instead of being interested in learning about the way the world is, it\u2019s rather much easier for them to assume their own distorted view is accurate.   \n   \nThey just assume they\u2019ve always been right, about everything they believe.   \n  \nThey often use their anger and their impotence as a cudgel to threaten and and silence anyone with different ideas. \u201cWhy should I live through the pain of all of those other emotions when I can just use anger and force to require those  around me to accept my position, or at least make them so uncomfortable that they shut up so I don\u2019t have to be reminded of how intellectually and emotionally weak I am? \u201c.  \n  \nNaturally anger and violence are the tools they\u2019re most comfortable (if not the only tools they are comfortable with.) \n  \nTLDR  They can\u2019t beat us with their brains, and because they are emotionally stunted adult children, they will instead try to beat our brains.",

Fewer and fewer people are staying right-wing.\n\nThe culture of conservatives is on its last legs. They are raging like a cornered animal, yes. They will lash out. They will threaten and scream and kick. Trump likely will get off on technical or outright favoritism bullshit. But the beast is officially mortally wounded.\n\nUnfortunately, what comes after is going to be the true storm. Because once conservatism is dead, then comes the true war between capitalism and anti-capitalism.

Capitalism works just fine with some well meaning people in charge, or at least some social structures mandated in law.  Norway as a country and per capita, is rich as fuuuuuck.  Don't just look at gdp, add the wealth fund.\n\nThe problem is American laissez-faire capitalism. \n\nCan you imagine the usa nationalising all its oil and gas, investing the profits and using that humongous wealth fund for the benefits of its citizens? Nope lol. Cause thats what Norway did in the 70s/80s. They are now the largest investment fund in the world. Tiny country but they have something like $300k for every citizen in the country, growing every year.  The UK found roughly the same quantity of oil and gas in roughly the same area, the government allowed their corporate paymasters to take it all, for free. Because they said they would pay taxes on the profits (they didnt even do that lol) All because 'Reagonomics'/Milton Freidman/Thatcherism laissez faire bullshit. Now they have more charity run food banks than branches of mcdonalds and public services barely exist, even after being taxed through the arsehole.\n\nUsa and uk both followed this Chicago school of economics 'trickle down' crap and the poor got poorer and the already wealthy, got wealthier.",

Lots of conservatives killed themselves licking doorknobs to deny covid is real. Fascists are disillusioned due to how weak and pathetic jan 6th was. More people than ever have accepted Trump is a criminal jackass idiot.\n\nBut his supporters that remain will probably be more desperate than ever since well. This indictment has a very real possibility of seeing Trump actually face prison. Guess it depends on who decides to show up but his call to arms in NY for that indictment went over like a wet fart.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas): \u201cIt has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don\u2019t do this in an election year.\u201d \n\n2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): \u201cIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president\u2019s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): \u201cThe very balance of our nation\u2019s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): \u201cA lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn\u2019t be denied a voice.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): \u201cThe campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): \u201cIn this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): \u201cThe Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): \u201cI think we\u2019re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): \u201cI believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn\u2019t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it\u2019s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): \u201cI strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.\u201d",

So if a vacancy occurs in their last year, of their first term, guess what, you will use their words against them. You will use their words against them. I want you to use my words against me. If there is a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said \u2018let\u2019s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination,\u2019 and you could use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right.\u201d \u2014 Sen.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), 10/03/2018 .\n\n\n\n\u201cA lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) 03/16/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a unique opportunity for the American people to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. Our side believes very strongly that the people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide, through their vote for the next president, the type of person who should be on the Supreme Court.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), 04/07/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president [Obama] exercised his unquestioned authority under the constitution, to nominate someone to this vacancy.

John Cornyn, (R-Texas). 03/16/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJustice Scalia was an American hero.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 02/13/2016.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been 80 years since the Senate has confirmed any judicial vacancy for the Supreme Court that occurred during a presidential election and the Republican majority in the Senate last year announced before Merrick Garland was nominated, before anyone was nominated, that we were going to keep this seat open and let the American people decide.\u201d \u2014 Sen.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 02/01/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt makes the current presidential election all that more important as not only are the next four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court\u2019s future.\u201d \u2014Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) 03/16/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.\u201d \u2014Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) 02/25/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVice President Biden\u2019s remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.\u201d \u2014Sen.

Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), 02/15/2016 \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.\u201d \u2014Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) 02/13/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) 02/13/2016\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is 80 years of precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme Court in the final year of a president\u2019s term so that people can have a say in this very important decision.\u201d \u2014Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) 02/17/2016 \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn\u2019t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it\u2019s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.\u201d \u2014Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) 02/15/2016\n\n\n\n\nAnd just one more time, Lindsey: \n\n\n\u201cAnd you could use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right.\u201d",

If you can easily predict someone\u2019s actions, then you should never be shocked by their choices and shouldn\u2019t have time wasted on their views. \n\nFor example: how many times does Lindsey Graham need to show us that his word means literally nothing? How many times does McConnell need to show us that he will use his position to only benefit Republicans?\n\nI\u2019m tired of seeing these people get the spotlight because *we already know and predict what they\u2019ll say*.\n\nThis goes for Democrats too. AOC and Bernie say *insert progressive talking point*? Wow, I\u2019m shocked. We need to give this attention to competitive district politicians. They\u2019re are the ones who *actually* have consequences for being hypocrites and lying.",

It's just hard to think of a solution when these same areas very well might vote essentially a carbon copy of these people in next.\n\n\nIt's their voters and supporters that are the cancer, the electees are just the symptoms.",

There is a good chance republicans are losing power across the board regardless of this latest development. A 6 to 3 supreme court is well worth losing the senate they potentially were losing anyhow.\n\nThis is when democrats finally need to grow a spine and realize they have to play hardball like republicans do. The moral high road is gone when the other side repeatedly plays by a different set of rules. Make an ultimatum that republicans have two choices: They can wait to confirm a justice after the election decided by America, or if they push through a justice then Democrats will promise to add more seats to the Supreme Court and expand statehood to DC. They should literally run their election with that as a promise. Republicans took your voice away on the appointment of justices (Garland), so we are now going to give it back if you vote us into majorities in the congress and presidency. Stop playing by rules that only democrats follow anyways.",

It's impossible.  And finding open-minded voters is also next to impossible for an individual. \n\nFinding non-voters is easy AND it can be easy to persuade them because many of them see the onslaught of insanity from the White House and many aren't voting because they are intimidated by the registration process. It's not easy to find all of them, but everyone knows people in one or both of these categories:\n\n1. New residents\n2. 18-22 year olds \n\nI'm on a personal mission to get 100 non-voters to register and to vote, each in my state and a neighboring state.  I'm at 10 and 3, respectively. All I do is reach out to them and have a private, one-on-one conversation over fb messenger and show them how simple it is to register and I solve every objection they have. \n\nIt's not hard or complicated, but it does take commitment. Happy to give examples if anyone is looking for help in joining me.",

Discovery for that trial would almost certainly involve a demand by the plaintiff for a DNA sample, which she claims would prove her claim. Then the DOJ would be defending Trump from rape charges. This is like the mirror universe version of pre-crime, where the DOJ is trying to prevent legal consequences for Trump on charges that haven't even been filed yet.",

They can say whatever they want but at the end of the day they will vote to get their objective done and have right wing media spin, deflect and smooth it all out PR wise.  Talking about what they say is a waste of time, reactionary and leads to playing defense/working out of a position of weakness.  We need to be assuming under all circumstances they will do what is politically expedient and focus on what actions need to be done to play offense, enough about words.\n\n\nEdit:  I am going to state what might be interpreted as callous but is the kind of ruthless offensive mindset Democrats will need to adopt in order to win.  Focus on the outcome of decisions and not the emotional distraction.  I have thought for years RBG deciding not to retire under Obama over 8 years as one that could bite the progressive movement given her advanced age and medical issues.  As much as RBG did, her selfish decision not to retire under Obama to instead gamble her 80 years and history of multiple cancer diagnoses to have her successor chosen by Hillary will unwind her work and create suffering for the next generation and beyond.  We need to focus on talking about how Democrats will mitigate the damage if they win in Nov. because there is no way the GOP will not vote someone in no matter what the outcome.  They have the holy grail of an opportunity handed to them with zero ability for procedural opposition during a time when the focus is on Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, an incredible turn of events now that the focus will be on getting his disaffected base out to vote to overturn Roe v Wade.  It is a breathtaking amount of luck inadvertently and astoundingly good timing for the GOP.  Again, zero possibility we do not have a Trump appointed justice \u2014 my point is outage and social media is a distraction, cathartic sure but unproductive unless channeled.  It\u2019s tough but Democrats need to ruthlessly focus on strategy and solutions to mitigate the impact of what will soon be inflicted.   They need to not be afraid to exploit loopholes or make new ones even if at the expense of red voters.  They need to unabashedly use bait and switch tactics, feign compromise and good faith to pull red voters but stick them the original progressive agenda.  The ends will have to justify the means like the Republicans operate.  We can\u2019t have one party who thinks this way and the other not and the Republicans are unified.  The only way forward is to be equally ruthless in moving progressive agenda items even if you have to use double speak to get elected.  In the end, what is said hasn\u2019t really mattered for a long time its about what is done and what is done is more durable than a Democratic candidate loser\u2019s social media opinion.   The ends justify the means \u2014 we will be able to save human rights and lives and protect the planet.  Once the end result is here no one will complain.   Just like how Republican voters now love Obamacare (when dubbed ACA) when they were initially conditioned to hate it because \u201csocialism\u201d.",

            "comment": "2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): \u201cIt has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don\u2019t do this in an election year.\u201d \n\n2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): \u201cIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president\u2019s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): \u201cThe very balance of our nation\u2019s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): \u201cA lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn\u2019t be denied a voice.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): \u201cThe campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): \u201cIn this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): \u201cThe Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): \u201cI think we\u2019re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): \u201cI believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn\u2019t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it\u2019s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): \u201cI strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.\u201d",

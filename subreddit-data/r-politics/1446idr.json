But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\u201d\n\u2015 Jean-Paul Sartre",

There is nothing wrong with wanting a secure border, and coming climate related migrations are a great boogey man for the people who want extremely strict border controls.\n\nIf stricter border controls is the trade for the right wing to accept that there is a coming climate crisis then I am all for it.\n\nIm an independent and I do want better border security, but I dont like the solutions proposed by the republicans like walls and military deployments. I want a review and reform of CBP. DHS has the funding and the manpower to handle the border, they just need more effective policies that dont result in kids locked in cages during a crisis.",

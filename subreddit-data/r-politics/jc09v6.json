I have been clean for years and I am very lucky, the love of my life was with me the whole way. We both casually used drugs when we started dating 15 years ago and got clean a few years ago now. The clinic, which MassHealth pays for me thank god, says we are a rare case. We stayed together through thick and thin and once we called and went in we have been clean since. Everyone there knows us as a couple and knows us by name, they take pride that we came out so well. I now am back working in my chosen career and I\u2019m in a better place today than I ever was. I take pride and joy in being a provider and maintaining a stable life, watching your life fall apart over years and year\u2019s and hitting rock bottom will really make you appreciate paying your phone bill without having to think about it and having a place to sleep for that matter. Shit is good, the funny part is watching Trump win was a big part in helping me see the reality of my life. My life has gone the opposite of America, they better I get the worse she gets.\n\n\nThat being said, as someone who lived it I truly think drug addiction is a consequence of people who are sick mentally, in one form or another. Every person I ever knew who even casually used drugs were people with issues, societal or monetary or familial. These people are not criminals, they are unwell and need help.",

His son was an addict, and in the first debate, when trump attacked hunters past drug use, Biden said \"My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He\u2019s overtaken it. He\u2019s fixed it. He\u2019s worked on it, and I\u2019m proud of him,\u201d. \n\nBefore that moment, I was voting for biden because trump is a disgrace to the world, but now I'm voting Biden proudly. The stigma around addiction is strong, and that he didn't care and instead took that moment to say how proud he was really showed his character.",

He wasn't just paying \"fambly valooz\" lip service or trying to score sympathy points, he was genuinely proud of his son for overcoming his obstacles. \n\nTrump, meanwhile, allegedly beat Don Jr to the ground for wearing a baseball jersey *to a baseball game*, threatened to disinherit Tiffany if she ever joined the military, thinks of Ivanka as his personal fucktoy, and ignores Barron unless he needs to use him as a prop. Oh, and let's not forget he savagely beat and raped Ivana because his hair hurt, cheated on all three of his wives, and slept with a porn star as his third wife was home nursing their newborn. But *he says* he's against abortion ~~even though he's most likely paid for a few of them himself~~ so that makes him like Captain Wholesome Family Man to conservatives.",

But I hope... that it doesn't say we are as racially and ethnically and religiously at odds with each other as it appears, as the president wants us to be.\n\nI was never a huge fan of Biden. But this answer was so humble and hopeful, delivered with such poignancy and straightforwardness -- it is probably one of my top 10 favorite political deliveries of all time. Maybe my view is colored by the fact that I know if asked the same question, Trump would say \"Oh if I lost it's because they cheated.\"\n\n[Here's the link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZzfrapNvo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8770).

They\u2019re great at condensing a week\u2019s worth of chaos into an entertaining and easy to understand 45 min episode.\n\nI highly recommend them. The Obama one is a good place to start.",

They deeply understand some historical backgrounds and undercurrents that might not be apparent on the nightly news.\n\n\nAt the same time, very down to earth. You feel like they\u2019re all sitting on your porch shooting the breeze about politics but it\u2019s in-depth thought and information.\n\n\nHighly recommend.\n\n\nEdit: one weird thing is that one guy (maybe Jon Favreau?) really sounds like Jimmy Fallon. When I listen I have a hard time picturing the real guy talking because I just picture Jimmy, but serious and smart, with a bit of humor.",

He\u2019s passionate and substantive. It\u2019s worth your time if you can do it.\n\nEdit: I feel like there\u2019s some weird stigma among liberals for saying you\u2019re proudly voting for Biden, but... I\u2019m excited to vote for him. He\u2019s proven to me that I can trust him to listen. Scientists, voters, other politicians, criticisms... he listens. And that\u2019s important when you\u2019re making big ass decisions. I originally wanted Warren but I\u2019m seeing a lot of the same things in Biden now that he\u2019s hit his stride. But, I would say he is more empathetic and sensitive. And with 220,000 dead Americans, I\u2019ll welcome an empathetic president who listens to scientists with open arms.",

Locking them up in a system with high recidivism, wherein jail time works against getting a proper job and reintegration into society in a healthy manner, hurts us all.\n\nSince the 1980s, the US prison population has grown 500%, even as crime rates have fallen.\n\n&gt;\tSince the official beginning of the War on Drugs in the 1980s, the number of people incarcerated for drug offenses in the U.S. skyrocketed from 40,900 in 1980 to 452,964 in 2017. Today, there are more people behind bars for a drug offense than the number of people who were in prison or jail for any crime in 1980. The number of people sentenced to prison for property and violent crimes has also increased even during periods when crime rates have declined.\n\nhttps://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/\n\n&gt;\tAccording to the Vera Institute of Justice, incarceration costs an average of more than $31,000 per inmate, per year, nationwide. In some states, it's as much as $60,000. Taxpayers foot the bill for feeding, housing and securing people in state and federal penitentiaries.\n\nhttps://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/19/how-much-does-it-cost-send-someone-prison/\n\nStill, there are 10x more people with mental illness in prisons in the US than in hospitals.\n\nEdit:\n\nIn regards to mental health, part of it is because we often treat it as a \u201cbattle against those with mental health issues\u201d instead of a battling alongside those who struggle with mental health.\n\nThis is why systems wherein health workers respond first to certain types of calls are so important, and already in place in parts of the US, such as CAHOOTS in Oregon, which answered 17% of Eugene\u2019s police department call volume in 2017 alone:\n\n&gt;\t31 years ago the City of Eugene, Oregon developed an innovative community-based public safety system to provide mental health first response for crises involving mental illness, homelessness, and addiction. White Bird Clinic launched CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) as a community policing initiative in 1989.\n\n&gt;\tThe CAHOOTS model has been in the spotlight recently as our nation struggles to reimagine public safety. The program mobilizes two-person teams consisting of a medic (a nurse, paramedic, or EMT) and a crisis worker who has substantial training and experience in the mental health field. The CAHOOTS teams deal with a wide range of mental health-related crises, including conflict resolution, welfare checks, substance abuse, suicide threats, and more, relying on trauma-informed de-escalation and harm reduction techniques. CAHOOTS staff are not law enforcement officers and do not carry weapons; their training and experience are the tools they use to ensure a non-violent resolution of crisis situations. They also handle non-emergent medical issues, avoiding costly ambulance transport and emergency room treatment.\n\n&gt;\tThe cost savings are considerable. The CAHOOTS program budget is about $2.1 million annually, while the combined annual budgets for the Eugene and Springfield police departments are $90 million. In 2017, the CAHOOTS teams answered 17% of the Eugene Police Department\u2019s overall call volume. The program saves the city of Eugene an estimated $8.5 million in public safety spending annually.\n\nhttps://whitebirdclinic.org/what-is-cahoots/\n\nThese programs save substantial amounts of money, and are far more helpful for the people interacted with. \n\nCops often escalate violence, even when they don\u2019t intend to. The presence of a force you feel is not there to help you, and you know can be deadly, leads to many more volatile interactions. Only 0.6% of CAHOOTS 24000 calls last year required backup. But across the country, an estimated 25% of those killed by police have mental illness. People with untreated mental illness are 16x more likely to be killed by law enforcement.",

            "comment": "When I was 15, my mom had back surgery. They gave her 60x 80mg oxycontin. She took one &amp; it made her sick. My dad just refilled it with other meds when 30 days passed (blood pressure, antidepressants). When I turned sixteen, probably 3 months later, I saw a report on the news about kids getting high on meds in their parents medicine cabinet (specifically mentioning OxyContin). Lo &amp; behold, I checked out the cabinet &amp; there were 119x 80mg OxyContin.\n\nThe 1st pill I took, I hung out with my best friend to this day (he never used opiates) &amp; told him what I took &amp; that I wanted to feel like \"this\" for the rest of my life.\n\nChased it every day after (while completing two college degrees, working full time, &amp; rasing a child once he was born) until I was 26 years old. Never sober for more than a few weeks at a time. Eventually recognized I would die doing that &amp; did not want my son to grow up without a father (my son was born when I was 22). Went to a doctor &amp; was on Subutex until I was almost 32 years old.\n\nWhen my Mom passed (from Alzheimers), she left me a little bit of money. I decided to do a 10 day detox in a rehab facility. My son's mother is amazing &amp; kept him for another month while I lay sick on my couch at home (we are very transparent with him &amp; just told him I was in rehab the entire time; we were honest about the addiction, but he was young &amp; we thought it would be difficult to explain that \"Dad is home but laying on the floor detoxing from opioid addiction\" [he has two good homes if that was not clear]). It was a nightmare. It took me nearly a year off Subutex to begin to feel normal.\n\nI will be 36 in November &amp; thus have been sober from opioids for four years. My best friend stood by me &amp; supported me through all of it. He was a kid too &amp; did not know how to handle a friend dealing with addiction. Really, he did a tremendous job as a friend. My son's mother is an extremely supportive co-parent &amp; a great mother.\n\nI should have never stolen pills from my parent's medicine cabinet. That was a terrible thing to do, even if they weren't going to be used. That was awful of me. I did many things I regret &amp; am not proud of.\n\nI am one of the fortunate ones. I had friends &amp; family to support &amp; love me. I got lucky. It may be a miracle that I did not die of an overdose; I certainly pushed it a few times. My son's mother apparently woke me up with cold water twice when she says I was not breathing. I am simply fortunate, in many ways.\n\nI made terrible &amp; selfish choices. However, I was struggling with addiction (not an excuse, but simply the facts). It took a lot of learning &amp; maturing for me to be where I am today. I am proud of the person I am today. Proud of the friend, son, father, &amp; co-parent that I turned out to be.\n\nPutting addicts in prison is not the answer. They need love, support, &amp; treatment.\n\nI made a lot of mistakes but recognized my mistakes &amp; made changes. I appreciate Joe Biden recognizing his mistakes &amp; also making changes.\n\nWe all face struggles &amp; make mistakes. Love to all.",

There is one where they interview the former police chief of Seattle among others and it echoes the points that Joe Biden made: especially the need for longer training of policemen.\n\nBiden's answer also reminded me of [Bunny Colvin's great speech to Carver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA5za4VsskM) about the difference between policing and having a drug war.",

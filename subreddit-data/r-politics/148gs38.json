Todd Blanche is a former Federal prosecutor and left a prestigious NY Firm but I don't believe he has ever appeared in a Florida court.  Chris Kise is a Florida lawyer, but isn't really a trial lawyer or criminal defense attorney.  This isn't the sort of case you want someone whose new to the area of law.\n\nThey were cold calling prominent defense attorneys all afternoon yesterday.  Quite a few friends of ours got short 4 minute calls where they were offered $0 to appear today and a promise of \"substantial compensation\" later.  Nobody who knows what they're doing is going to agree to that.  Getting paid in exposure isn't worth it if you're known well enough to be getting the call in the first place.",

Now Epshteyn\u2019s records get confiscated, now Epshteyn is being questioned by investigators for a grand jury. Who would sign up for this but low talent grifters who need the attention?",

Even if both the lawyer and the client want out of the relationship, the judge can still refuse to let the lawyer quit, because it might cause delays or even mistrials, set up appeals, etc. Usually if the client isn't paying that strengthens the lawyer's case to be let out, but even then it depends on where the case is and what the consequences of withdrawal would be. \n\nTaking him on for this isn't like taking him on for a civil matter or whatever, where withdrawal is a lot easier. This thing could go on for years, his willingness to drag lawyers into criminal activity and then fucking brag about it means it would be a CONSTANT ethical headache, if you have partners in different practice areas, they're not going to be willing to lose clients over this guy, AND (and this isn't nothing) - you're going to lose. Which, in the ordinary course of criminal defense, is a thing that happens, but you usually don't have to deal with clients whose supporters might fucking kill you and your family. If you jump into this, you're looking at giving up your entire practice to focus on it for like 2 full years, and at the end, it's going to suck. \n\nSomeone will take it on (the multimillion dollar retainer it's going to have to come with is going to be a big incentive), but it won't be someone who has other options.",

                            "comment": "Short answer: probably not.\n\nLonger answer: Trump already has lawyers, they're just not admitted in Florida. There's this procedure called a pro hac vice admission for lawyers who want to practice in a jurisdiction they're not admitted to. It basically says you can be admitted for purposes of this one case. Every jurisdiction has different pro hac rules, and they all require that you associate in an attorney who is admitted in that jurisdiction, just so you're not constantly fucking up local procedural stuff. Trump has a defense team already, so what he needs is basically someone to fog a mirror, put their name on stuff, and sit at counsel table during proceedings. \n\nA PD wouldn't have the expertise needed here, but there are lawyers who sign up as \"panel attorneys\" - basically put their name on a list the court can draw from for defendants who need a specialized defense attorney. The court would draw the most qualified attorney in the area of law from this panel, at a court-assigned rate. Alternatively, and in the most extreme and specialized circumstances, the court does technically have the ability to just pick any member of the bar - lawyers have certain ethical obligations as officers of the court, so it would be tough to say \"no.\" (This is almost never done, but...y'know. We've never had a former president indicted under the espionage act before, so...) These lawyers ONLY have to participate in the stuff that's mandatory - any discretionary appeals, etc, they can opt out of.\n\nNone of this will actually happen here - Trump will find local counsel. A court-appointed attorney would be a major problem for him. When you've got a client like this, you're almost certainly going to find yourself making ethical calls where the rules aren't clear-cut. Trump doesn't want a lawyer in the room who's not going to agree to push the absolute outer limits of those ethical constraints - dude fucking asked his lawyers to get rid of incriminating evidence for him. This is all just an (ill-advised) initial test by his attorneys to see how far this judge will let him push his shenanigans.",

I start by saut\u00e9ing shallots (Asian or European), once sweated add whichever curry paste you are using and cook until fragrant. Add protein and brown or cook through. Lower the heat to medium and stir in coconut milk and bring to simmer. Add fish sauce, palm sugar, and birds eye chilies to taste. Add vegetables at this point and simmer for around 12-15 minutes based on vegetables type. At end turn off heat stir in thai basil until wilted and then add combination of torn and diced kiffar lime leaves at end (this will make take your curry to a new level fragrance wise).",

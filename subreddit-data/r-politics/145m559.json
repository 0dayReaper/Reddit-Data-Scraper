General Mills pulled its production from apartheid areas of Israel following boycotts. Also see: why a bunch of politicians want to make Israel-related boycotts illegal (anti-bds laws). It's not because they don't work. Advertisers for Fox and NRA funders have backed out after boycotts or boycotts threats. The reason the right is so consistently losing the culture war, and therefore more seriously considering fascism, is because people with empathetic morals have and spend a LOT more money than the angry haters do. They also boycott effectively, not just for virtue signaling. If you shoot your yeti cooler on camera and then have to go buy another one, you've only helped the company.",

Dermizax NX and Pertex Quantum both breathe (letting water vapor out but keeping liquid from getting in) more than double as well (Dermizax's breathability numbers are in the 50k/24hrs range and GorePro us closer to 22k/24hrs depending on temp and altitude). Gore has been the gold standard, but more and more brands are moving to alternatives in competing pride points. Patagonia's H2No (licensed Dermizax) and TNF's new FutureLight collections are great examples of this, as are TREW and FlyLow's entire outerwear collections.",

I agree that the MHW in house stuff is decent (it's eVent), and their gore stuff is better (that's really a function of the face and backing fabric they use and skimp on the cost for their lower tier, in house stuff). \n\nThe latest H2No from Patagonia is the step down from Dermizax's NX (XT I think?), That is less breathable and I'm not a fan. all of TREW is NX these days, and it's fucking rad stuff. I got 87 days in backcountry here in the Wasatch in our snowiest year ever this year in TREW's stuff and never wetted through once. \n\nYou're absolutely right that Pertex can be hit or miss. their Quantum is a great emergency layer, but I don't have much experience with any of their other fabric. It's a bummer to hear that TNF's FutureLight stuff is shit. Friends here in SLC and Park City have been raving about it.",

Eugenio Guanto. Father Guanto presented his treatise, \u201cThe Covered Hand\u201d to Cardinal Austi Spumanti as part of his defense against charges of ecumenicalism. It was a meandering premise that had to do with the hand of God being covered finest Corinthian leather - an analogy for the mysterious intervention of God\u2019s powers in human lives, but you, probably, this being Reddit, already knew this\u2026",

But none the less, this guy just ain't capable of not flapping his mouth. And who can blame him? He's literally never faced punishment for his crimes and has an entire life of bullying and intimidation to tell him that's the way to do it. He's a child in a geriatric man's body who never grew up or learned any of the right lessons in life. The ultimate failson.",

And unfortunately he's probably right...if he could keep his mouth shut. But he's also so fucking arrogant that he thinks he can just lie his way out of any situation. And he can't just sit back and let the legal process work itself out because when he feels like he is under attack he feels a compulsion to attack back. He's just going to keep digging a deeper and deeper hole because he can't shut up, can't tell the truth, and can't back down. The only outcome I see is that he escalates the lies and violent rhetoric until he's openly asking supporters to murder his opponents. There is only a thin veil on it now so I don't think it will be long before it drops.",

She has shown through her previous rulings that she will ignore law and rule in favor of Trump. She was overturned the last time she attempted to do so however, as the presiding judge in the current matter she can simply dismiss all charges with prejudice at the beginning of the trial and that is the end of the matter. Trump cannot be charged again as the case was adjudicated and double jeopardy rules prevent another charge.",

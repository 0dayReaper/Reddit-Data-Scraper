It's giving the adversaries of the United States insight into how things are planned, operational capabilities, and strategic weaknesses. Any new plan made is underpinned by America's capabilities. If an adversary knows that the US has x capability they can plan around it. If an adversary knows sources and methods they can take steps to counter. If an adversary knows the US plans in a certain manner and goes through a certain process they can exploit that. If the US's strategic weaknesses are openly exposed they can be exploited. \n\nNone of these factors can be \"redone\". The US is constrained by the capabilities is presently possesses. It is constrained by the organizational structure of the government and how things are planned. US strategic weaknesses are not solved in a matter of hours days weeks months or even years.\n\nEven the things that can be changed still present security risks. Things like codes and passwords even when changed later still pose risk because they provide information that degrade security. It is much easier to compromise a security feature when you know what a legitimate password looks like: length+ composition.\n\nEdit: grammar",

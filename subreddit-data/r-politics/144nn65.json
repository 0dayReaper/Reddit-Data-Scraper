Some more info:\n\n&gt;The letter noted that the committee\u2019s investigators had obtained evidence that Mr. Gingrich had been in touch with senior advisers to Mr. Trump about advertisements that amplified false claims about election fraud in the November 2020 election.\n\n&gt;According to Mr. Thompson, Mr. Gingrich urged the Trump campaign to run ads focused on the bogus assertion that suitcases of fake ballots had been smuggled into a vote-processing area by election workers in Atlanta.\n\nHe also supposedly had some [involvement](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-orders-newt-gingrich-to-testify-in-georgia-2020-election-probe) in the fake elector scheme.\n\n&gt;Gingrich was also involved in a plan to have Republican fake electors sign certificates falsely stating that Trump had won the state and that they were the state\u2019s official electors even though Biden had won, the petition says.",

The figure heads/mouth pieces like Newt, Trump may be just loud mouth hypocritical morons, but the think tanks, advisors and strategists that you never hear of or see are uber wonks that have most angles covered well ahead of time, years if not decades. (so much money \"in play\" richest country in history and all that) They knew HRC was going to be a major threat for the presidency so they started the smear campaign pretty early for instance.",

She had the ability to reject wealthy influence and gain votes of the labor class.  She and politicians like her who actually advocate for labor, they scare the fuck out of these rich goons.",

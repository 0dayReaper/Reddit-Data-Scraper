Obama administration did have to deal with H1N1 and the virus was prolific, but they handled and you dont hear too much about it. It certainly wasnt as widespread as Covid. Trump systemically dismantled key government resources to respond to pandemic events. Then blame the events of 2019 on a 3 years removed president. \n\nKeep in mind, this is the president that is the best of the best of the best. Most powerful and most effective. No one can get in his way or stop him from doing anything. However it was always some miraculous event when things went wrong because for all his pomp and bluster about how awesome, powerful, and unshakeable he was, he always seemed to have piss-ant nobodies with no power capable of tearing him down. \n\nTLDR: Typical fascist response. Always the most dominant and powerful while also always being victimized by others.",

We were at our weakest, firmly in an artificial bubble, which, of course, popped.\n\nPeople were screaming every step of the way about how Trump was trading future security for temporary and illusory gains.\n\nThe result? Half a million dead. Economy trashed. \n\nTheir response?\n\n\"Nobody could have seen this coming\"",

(Trump thought it was, and he didn't get that wall built, did he?)\n\nThe rest, they think are lies and political hit jobs to stop their great man from saving the world.

Now Russian Times is using Trump and Fox News soundbites to further propagandize this war to their citizens.\n\n* Praised Putin constantly, called him a \"strong leader\", has peddled statements like \"he's done a really great job outsmarting our country\"\n* **Impeached for illegally witholding Ukraine military aid, already appropriated to them by Congress, unless they made up political dirt on Biden. Specifically Ukraine was asking for the Javelin anti-tank systems that are now helping them fend off Russian advancements.**\n* Trump dismissed and cast doubt about Russian hacking, particularly when the U.S determined that Russia hacked the DNC in 2016, while ironically enough, he encouraged Russian cyber attacks on national TV saying, \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\"\n* When addressing Russian election interference and cyber attacks, Trump proclaimed \"I don't see any reason why it would be Russia\" after speaking directly with Putin, defending Russia and trusting Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Later he \"corrected\" himself, claiming that he meant to say \"wouldn't\" instead of would.\n* Trump suggested the U.S. work directly with Russia on cybersecurity. Trump refused to punish or critique the SolarWinds hack.\n* Almost directly after the 2016 election, Trump sought to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia, while he was even open to lifting sanctions.\n* Trump dismissed the notion that Putin was a \"killer\", downplaying the idea that Putin resorts to using violence and oppressive tactics to crush political opponents. He defended Putin, rationalizing his ruthless despotism in the process, declaring, \"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\"\n* Trump shared highly classified U.S. intelligence with Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017.\n* Trump repeated Kremlin talking points related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, reiterating things like, \"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\"\n* Trump constantly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin. (quite relevant)\n* Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomats as a retaliation for sanctions.\n* Trump refused to make a statement about the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. According to John Bolton, European leaders noticed Trump's silence and \"became even more concerned about American resolve.\"\n* According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him\n* Trump congratulated and gave legitimacy to Putin's re election win in 2018, a victory said to \"lack genuine competition\"\n* Sergei Skripal, an ex Russian spy that defected to the UK, was poisoned. Sanctions were announced, Trump attempted to rescind them, while asserting that the U.S. was being \"too tough on Putin\"\n* When congress passed new sanctions against Russia in 2017, Trump was very reluctant to signing the bill, and probably wouldn't have signed it if the bill didn't pass with veto-proof majorities in both houses\n* In 2017 it was reported that Trump was considering returning spy bases to Russia.\n* Trump praised and highlighted pro-Russian leaders in Europe. Far right European leaders with close ties to Putin. He even met a Kremlin ally at the Whitehouse.\n* When Trump withdrew troops from Syria, it gave Russia and Putin an opportunity to control abandoned U.S. outposts and checkpoints.",

Putin wants a world order where oligarchs are in charge and peasants labor their lives away. He pretty much wants to take the entire world back to the last Russian Tsar\u2019s era.",

Also it's important to not overcredit Trump for simply being a conservative, Moscow Mitch already sold out Kentucky to Russia, all but one I believe Republicans covered for Trump's illegal witholding of Ukraine, all the Republicans who traveled to Putin on July 4th, etc.\n\n* Praised Putin constantly, called him a \"strong leader\", has peddled statements like \"he's done a really great job outsmarting our country\"\n* Trump dismissed and cast doubt about Russian hacking, particularly when the U.S determined that Russia hacked the DNC in 2016, while ironically enough, he encouraged Russian cyber attacks on national TV saying, \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\"\n* When addressing Russian election interference and cyber attacks, Trump proclaimed \"I don't see any reason why it would be Russia\" after speaking directly with Putin, defending Russia and trusting Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Later he \"corrected\" himself, claiming that he meant to say \"wouldn't\" instead of would.\n* Trump suggested the U.S. work directly with Russia on cybersecurity. Trump refused to do anything about Russia's attack on Solar Winds.\n* Almost directly after the 2016 election, Trump sought to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia, while he was even open to lifting sanctions.\n* Trump dismissed the notion that Putin was a \"killer\", downplaying the idea that Putin resorts to using violence and oppressive tactics to crush political opponents. He defended Putin, rationalizing his ruthless despotism in the process, declaring, \"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\"\n* Trump shared highly classified U.S. intelligence with Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017.\n* Trump repeated Kremlin talking points related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, reiterating things like, \"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\"\n* Trump constantly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin. (quite relevant)\n* Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomats as a retaliation for sanctions.\n* Trump refused to make a statement about the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. According to John Bolton, European leaders noticed Trump's silence and \"became even more concerned about American resolve.\"\n* According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him\n* Trump congratulated and gave legitimacy to Putin's re election win in 2018, a victory said to \"lack genuine competition\"\n* Sergei Skripal, an ex Russian spy that defected to the UK, was poisoned. Sanctions were announced, Trump attempted to rescind them, while asserting that the U.S. was being \"too tough on Putin\"\n* When congress passed new sanctions against Russia in 2017, Trump was very reluctant to signing the bill, and probably wouldn't have signed it if the bill didn't pass with veto-proof majorities in both houses\n* In 2017 it was reported that Trump was considering returning spy bases to Russia.\n* Trump praised and highlighted pro-Russian leaders in Europe. Far right European leaders with close ties to Putin. He even met a Kremlin ally at the Whitehouse.\n* When Trump withdrew troops from Syria, it gave Russia and Putin an opportunity to control abandoned U.S. outposts and checkpoints.\n* Trump froze U.S. aide for Ukraine in it's war against Russian proxies. He repeated Russian disinformation surrounding Ukraine as well.\n* Trump made requests to bring Russia back into the G7 and invited Putin to the 2020 G7 summit",

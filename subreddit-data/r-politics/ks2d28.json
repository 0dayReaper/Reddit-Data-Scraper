It was apparent early on to the CIA that Trump is the last person who needs to know anything beyond the most vague instructions. He leaked intel to the Russians in his first hundred days. So I\u2019m sure that they have long since stopped keeping him in the loop on the most sensitive info. This is definitely the best move they could\u2019ve done but also one more reason he never should have been elected. When the president can\u2019t be trusted with all the info he can\u2019t effectively lead. But that\u2019s the way it is and the intel community knows that. I mean they told him not to pal around with Flynn and that he was compromised - Trump ignored them and made him fucking secretary of defense! \n\nIf I\u2019m confident of anything it\u2019s that Trump has been kept out of the real intel. Perhaps Pence has been handling it or something but I guarantee the need to know rule has been more strict than ever. \n\nI\u2019m nobody and this is speculation but it seems like the only sane way they could\u2019ve proceeded with an obviously compromised president.",

            "comment": "Full article:\n\nPresident Trump broke any number of laws and norms during his ruinous four-year reign. He just added one more on the way out: treason.\n\nHe lost the House in 2018. He lost the presidency in November. He lost the Senate on Tuesday. And on Wednesday, with nothing left to lose, he rallied a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol in hopes of pressuring lawmakers to toss out the election results, ignore the will of the people, and install him as president for another term.\n\nTrump fomented a deadly insurrection against the U.S. Congress to prevent a duly-elected president from taking office. Treason is not a word to be used lightly, but that is its textbook definition.\n\n\u201cWe will not take it anymore, and that\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d he told a sea of MAGA fans and Proud Boys on the Ellipse outside the White House at noon. From behind bulletproof glass, he told them: \u201cIf you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d\nAD\n\nEarlier, Trump ally Rudy Giuliani had proposed, to the same crowd, a \u201ctrial by combat\u201d to resolve Trump\u2019s election complaints. And Donald Trump Jr. delivered a political threat to lawmakers who don\u2019t vote to reject the election results: \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you.\u201d\n\nThe elder Trump worked the crowd into a frenzy with his claim that victory had been stolen from him by \u201cexplosions of bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit! Bullshit!\u201d the mob chanted.\n\nTrump instructed his supporters to march to the Capitol \u2014 \u201cand I\u2019ll be there with you\u201d \u2014 to \u201cdemand that Congress do the right thing\u201d and not count the electoral votes of swing states he lost. \u201cYou\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong,\u201d he admonished them, with CYA instructions to make themselves heard \u201cpeacefully and patriotically.\u201d\nAD\n\nWink, wink.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the Capitol,\u201d he told the mob.\n\nWith that, Trump snuck back into the safety of the White House fortress. But his supporters, thus riled, marched to the Capitol and breached the barricades. They overpowered Capitol Police, climbed scaffolding, scaled walls, shattered glass, busted into the Senate chamber and stood at the presiding officer\u2019s desk, and broke into Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hastily abandoned office. They marauded about the Rotunda and Statuary Hall wearing MAGA hats, carrying Confederate flags, posing for souvenir photos and scribbling graffiti (\u201cMurder the Media\u201d).\n\nPolice rushed legislative leaders to safety. They barricaded doors to the House chamber and drew guns to protect lawmakers sheltering inside. They fired tear gas at the attackers. Shots were fired inside the Capitol; a bloodied woman who was wheeled out later died. The District of Columbia declared a curfew. And even then it took Trump nearly three hours before he released a video telling those ransacking the Capitol to \u201cgo home\u201d \u2014 even as he glorified the violence by saying \u201cthese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots.\u201d\nAD\n\nBefore he lost the election, Trump refused to commit to the peaceful transfer of power. During the campaign, he defended militia violence and told his violent white nationalist supporters to \u201cstand by\u201d \u2014 part of a well-documented pattern of encouraging violence since he launched his first campaign in 2015.\n\nYet, somehow, the men in the Capitol who enabled Trump for all those years were shocked that he would unleash a mob against Congress.\n\n\u201cWhat is unfolding is unacceptable and un-American,\u201d declared House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who just hours earlier had announced he would support Trump\u2019s effort to annul the electoral college count.\n\n\u201cViolence is always unacceptable,\u201d tut-tutted Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who along with Josh Hawley of Missouri was leading the effort in the Senate to nullify the election results. Just moments before the MAGA mob burst into the chamber, Cruz gave a speech saying \u201cdemocracy is in crisis\u201d because many Americans think the election was \u201crigged\u201d \u2014 in large part because Cruz et al. kept telling them so.\nAD\n\nAs Trump\u2019s goons began taking over the Capitol, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who had called the attempt to set aside the electoral college tally an \u201cegregious ploy,\u201d yelled at Cruz and his co-conspirators: \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve gotten, guys.\u201d Romney later issued a statement saying: \u201cWhat happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House GOP leader, told Fox News: \u201cThe president formed the mob. The president incited the mob. The president addressed the mob. He lit the flame.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s inept legal challenges amounted to a clownish coup attempt. The Cruz-Hawley scheme amounted to a bloodless coup attempt. And now, Trump has induced his MAGA mob to a violent coup attempt.\n\nAs it happens, moments before the barbarians busted into the Senate chamber, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, long among the most faithful Trump enablers, had denounced the effort to overturn the election.\nAD\n\n\u201cThe voters, the courts and the states have all spoken,\u201d an emotional McConnell said, in perhaps the finest speech of his long career. \u201cIf this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.\u201d\n\nOr maybe the spiral has already begun.\n\nMost Americans never imagined they would see such banana-republic images of violence from the seat of American democracy. But Wednesday\u2019s mayhem and violence form a predictable coda to a presidency that has brought us far too much of both.\n\nRepublicans must now decide whether they are going to return to being the party of small government, individual liberties and national strength, or to continue being the Trump and Cruz party of violence, racism and authoritarianism.\n\nAre they small-d democrats or are they fascists? After Wednesday\u2019s terrible scene, they must choose.",

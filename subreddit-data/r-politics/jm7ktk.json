There was a long tent with a bunch of openings so you could pull your car in and drive out the other side and technically be \"inside\" the tent the entire time. The ballots in question never left the site because your car is INSIDE the site.\n\nThe ballots were also electronic. They were cast on a large device that was hard wired back into the polling tent the entire time. You had to show your ID, sign and certify your identity, enter a code on the ballot that corresponded to just you, and make your selections before handing it back off. You couldn't physically leave with them and they weren't usable without the poll worker verifying your identity.\n\nIn case you can't tell, I was one of the shmucks that did the drive thru voting.

It may of also been caused by a story i didnt want to share, but i will now since there is some interest. 3 days ago he was ripped off, or as i like to call it \"trumped\". A did a job for a rich guy in a gated community, and was paid with a check. The check was canceled immediately and he account was overdrawn by enough to destory his entire paycheck. I told he you were trumped bud, and he said \"dont want to hear your political bullshit\". He obviously cant go back and contront the man because their is an armed guard.\n\nI think he prob thought about what i said, and i think it made it hard to rationalize away the trump caravan.",

We stopped speaking for two months because he started trying say nasty lies about biden, and i hung up. He never mentioned it again when we next spoke. He avoided politics after that with me. Other than trump is prob going to lose about 4 days ago. \n\nHes not a critical thinker. Hes great with his hands and again a very loyal friend, but he is not someone i can have a deep conversation with or someone who really weighs what hes told. If his other trump supporting friends tell him biden is a corrupt, he takes that at face value. He even told me he believed the obama birth certificate story. I think thats what sent me over the edge and why we stopped talking for a while if i recall.\n\nHe also is someone who did not care about staying safe with covid. He doesnt do masks. \n\nI dont think ill ever get the real answer why this was it though. +1 in florida is enough for me",

All of us who believe in the core ideals of this country should want more votes counted and more voices heard. While it may be too late for this election, the Republican Party needs to return to a place where we win with ideas and persuasion rather than trying to intimidate and silence our fellow citizens. I hope all elected statewide leaders in the Texas Republican Party will stand up against these desperate tactics.\n\n*****\n\nEdit:\n\nI don't really find this too surprising. He is a ~~Bear~~ Bexar County Republican (fiscally conservative but tend to be more bipartisan in their approach than other more harmful conservatives in the state). I remember there being brouhaha over his \"Democratic governance\" despite being a Republican in the last few years of his tenure as speaker.\n\nEdit edit: Bexar. Damn autocorrect.",

In its place, trump has conducted a trade war, imposing billions in tariffs \u2014 taxes that are actually paid by Americans \u2014 without any concessions from China.\n* **Mr. Trump has treated the COVID-19 global pandemic as a public relations problem instead of working to save American lives.**\n* He lied about the danger of the coronavirus, challenged the expertzs and resisted proactive precautions; now he's trying to force the economy open without bringing the virus under control.\n* As the economy collapsed, he signed an initial round of aid and when the stock market rebounded, even though millions remained out of work, Mr. Trump lost interest.\n* **In September, he declared that the virus \u201caffects virtually nobody\u201d the day before the death toll from the disease in the United States topped 200,000. Nine days later, he caught the virus and received $100,000 in taxpayer funded health care to fight the virus that he did nothing to avoid contracting.**\n* He has pitted Americans against each other, weaponizing Twitter and Facebook to manipulate supporters around a virtual bonfire of grievances to flood the public square with lies, disinformation and propaganda.\n* **At the first presidential debate in September, trump was asked to condemn white supremacists. He responded by instructing the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d**\n* In June, his administration tear-gassed peaceful protesters from a street in front of the White House so trump could pose with a book he does not read in front of a church he does not attend.\n* trump has repeatedly directed administration officials not to testify before Congress or provide documents, notably including his tax returns.\n* **With the help of AG william barr, he's shielded loyal aides (convicted criminals) from justice.**\n* In May, the Justice Department said it would drop the prosecution of michael flynn even though flynn had [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/michael-flynn-charges-dropped.html) to lying to the F.B.I.\n* In July, trump commuted sentence of former aide, roger stone, who was convicted of obstructing a federal investigation of trump. Senator mitt romney condemned the act as an \u201cunprecedented, historic corruption.\u201d\n* trump pressured the Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, then directed administration to obstruct a congressional inquiry.\n* In December, the House voted to impeach trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. Senate Republicans, excepting Mr. Romney, voted to acquit the president, ignoring his corruption so they could continue to fill the benches of the federal judiciary with [young, conservative lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html).\n* The president votes by mail while saying it's corrupt without proof. His disinformation campaign serves as a rationale for purging voter rolls, closing polling places, tossing absentee ballots and otherwise impeding Americans from exercising their right to vote.\n* **He cannot solve the nation\u2019s pressing problems because he is the nation\u2019s most pressing problem.** \n\nFrederick Douglass lamented during another of the nation\u2019s dark hours, the presidency of Andrew Johnson, \u201cWe ought to have our government so shaped that even when in the hands of a bad man, we shall be safe.\u201d But that is not the nature of our democracy. The implicit optimism of American democracy is that the health of the Republic rests on the judgment of the electorate and the integrity of those voters choose.\n\nThe vast amount and variety of trump\u2019s \"misdeeds\" can feel overwhelming. The repetition might have dulled your sense of outrage and it can leave us with little time to focus on the details. **That said, this moment is when Americans must recover their sense of outrage.** Use it to [VOTE and get others to VOTE.](https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/)\n\n(Remix of the NYT opinion piece for easier consumption.

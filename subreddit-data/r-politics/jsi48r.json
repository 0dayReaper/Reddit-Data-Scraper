But, those same voters voted R\u2019s on the down ballots. Chester didn\u2019t so much flip, as it simply said fuck Trump. Respect to those guys and girls.\n\nEdit: another user has pointed out that my information is inaccurate as Trump actually got *more* votes in Chester than he did in 2016. Crazy, right? The basis of my comment came from a news cast I saw on Monday night. Still though, Chester voted Biden. So thanks again to those people for doing their part!",

I found [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment) list and it's actually pretty interesting. While Wyoming has lower than average postsecondary rates, it's actually not that far off. The three worst states as far as that goes are West Virginia, Mississippi and Nevada, with Wyoming being in 41st place. The best states are Massachusetts, Colorado and Maryland. The outliers (territories) are American Samoa at the lowest end and DC at the highest end.\n\nAnyway, I guess I semi- take back my comments about Wyoming specifically, but looking at this list also affirms the idea behind this post. There's a huge disparity in education throughout the US.",

They want to keep their base in a lower state of mind so it's easier to lie to and manipulate. It's why Trump's gaslighting has been so effective. A lot of people are locked into a very tiny world view that gets jammed down their throats since they were children. So to them, Trump &amp; the GOP are the only true &amp; honorable people to stand behind. Everyone else eats babies and wants to drink your blood.\n\nAdding tribalism onto this makes it worse. There are many folks who treat politics as a Team A vs Team B sports game. Their \"winning\" lures them into some false sense of security because they feel the same way after their football team won the Superbowl. \n\nThat's as simplified as I can get. In reality, there's a lot more to dig into to really see what's going on. But scratching just enough off the surface to get the general flow of it.",

I think it was back in 2012, some edited the graphic to make the districts proportional to the population, which distorted it but you could see the huge masses of urban populations.\n\nEdit: it was 2016.

The article says, \"Theoretically, the number could shrink with more tallying underway, but Biden's lead is expected to continue going up,\" which was already true on Saturday, and \"Biden is now up by 50,000 votes, which means that even if Trump's legal team is successful in getting courts to toss out 10,000 votes received between Election Day and Nov. 6, there's little chance they could actually alter the results,\" which doesn't pertain to the notion of an automatic recount.\n\n2) The [NYT data scraper](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#) estimates that there are 32,000 votes left to be counted in Pennsylvania. Biden's win margin is currently about 51,000 votes. If all the remaining votes went to Trump, Trump would trail by 19,000 votes, or about 0.3% of the total, which would trigger an automatic recount. Trump hasn't passed any new threshold in relation to recounts.",

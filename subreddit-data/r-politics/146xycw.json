He started a relatively honest investigation into Trump/Giuliani's allegations of election fraud, so that he could say definitively, by December 20, that _the DOJ had investigated all of their charges, and found nothing._\n\nHe might just be spinning his actions, but I think he was done with Trump by the day after the 2020 election. I think he deceived Trump into thinking he was helping him steal the election, while he was working, finally, for the good of the country.\n\nAlmost everyone has their limits. 8 supreme court justices sided against Trump during  his frivolous post-election lawsuits, and I was somewhat surprised that 3 of them did so.",

They are that highly classified. Some of the documents actually fall under a special provision and can only be unclassified through an act of congress. \n\nThere are many many levels of classification, the stuff trump has is as high as it goes. I can't imagine why even a president would need those accessible outside a scif. It seems really dangerous just from a handling perspective to every have them outside armed custody in a scif.",

What is being claimed is fucking bat shit. Its horrifying. Its Alien. Some of the documents hes claimed to have FORCE the question, why would someone who cares about the safety and security of the united states posses them outside a secured and guarded government facility, much less a scif. The things he has are not things anyone in this country are allowed to make mistakes with. If we allow mistakes to happen with what he had, we invite disaster.

There\u2019s no mystery here, no complex web to unravel.  He was selling them to the highest bidder, plain and simple.  Think of the types of documents that have been mentioned in this thread - documents relating to U.S. nuclear secrets and things like that.  Can you even begin to imagine how valuable those would be to a foreign government?   It truly boggles the mind when you think about it.  And the fact that he refused to return the documents and fought to retain them just shows that he wasn\u2019t done selling them and was still actively profiting from them",

Unfortunately for him, the intelligence community doesnt have the luxury of being able to even ask that question. They have to assume he was and then try and prove themselves wrong. There are levels of security no one gets to fuck with. You step a foot over the line, you begin to endanger lives. Trump has stepped over the line. It honestly doesnt matter if he was or wasnt going to give them to a foreign nation. They were unsecured. We know spies are in and out of mar a lago. Quick google and youll see the government has caught spies there.\n\nSo this guy has some of the highest levels of classified data just strewn about unsecured in a place that spies are known to frequent, and this isnt fucking terrifying to everyone? WHY?????? We have to assume other people now have them and change EVERYTHING. We dont get to operate on hopes and dreams in the military. You either know the information is secure.

Cannon's corrupt track record and history of being a very enthusiastic Trump devotee ALONE should have disqualified her from consideration at all - let alone actually select her to preside over the case.\n\nIn my view, Cannon is Trump's ace-up-his-sleeve and with her presiding it is practically guaranteed that not only will this ***NOT*** be a fair trial, Cannon ***WILL*** ensure, however surreptitiously that the DOJ\u2019s case is de-railed.\n\nNo question in my mind whatsoever.",

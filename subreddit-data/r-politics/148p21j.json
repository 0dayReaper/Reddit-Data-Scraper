Which is not how it works: when Biden and Pence discovered classified docs in their files, they called NARA and said \"come and get 'em!\"\n\nBut it's clearly how trump thinks the process goes, or should go, and how he explained it to the lawyer in question. He has something NARA wants, therefore NARA should give (\"negotiate\") something trump wants back in exchange for them. At a minimum, NARA should negotiate to allow trump to keep some of the docs for himself.",

The NARA tracked all of the documents, they know what is missing.  If it was for sale then Trump would make a copy and either return the original or destroy it and force the NARA to prove he had it.\n\nIf the documents were for sale they would be organized for sale.  Instead investigators found them scattered in multiple locations, file folders empty, etc.  It is very hard to sell secrets to someone when you don't know what physical state they may be in.\n\nWhy continue to retain them once the NARA asks for them back?  He could have returned them at that point and gotten out without any legal penalty.\n\nThe only reason to retain the physical documents is out of some weird compulsion to say \"No!\" to anyone who wants anything from him.

On the contrary, Trump's communications with people he showed documents to suggest he had no idea how he such a scheme would play out. Likely, he didn't have any concrete plan but was just holding out for an opportunity to weaponize them. \n\n&gt;\tThis fits Trump's larger pattern of constantly trying to find ways to cheat the system for personal or political advantage, and his willingness to take big risks in doing so. We see this pattern in his two impeachment trials. \n\nTrump is always looking for 1) money and 2) advantage over others. \n\nI think he\u2019s smart enough to steal something that might help him later, and dumb enough to store it in a bathroom. \n\nI guess the trial may shed light on this.",

Every day we are reminded. $8 for a dozen eggs. $100 to fill up my tank. $150/month water bill.  Very few things are still affordable - Car insurance ($23 per month from Insurance Panda) and gym ($20/month from Planet Fitness). But I\u2019m sure those will go up soon thanks to Bidenflation.\n\nTrump is exactly who we need. Love him or hate him, nobody can deny that he will not put up with any nonsense from overseas. Our adversaries fear him that\u2019s why they want to arrest him.",

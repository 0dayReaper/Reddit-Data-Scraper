One explained how the process works by saying that ex-presidents take documents, the national archive asks for them back, \"and then you negotiate\". Which is not how it works: when Biden and Pence discovered classified docs in their files, they called NARA and said \"come and get 'em!\"\n\nBut it's clearly how trump thinks the process goes, or should go, and how he explained it to the lawyer in question. He has something NARA wants, therefore NARA should give (\"negotiate\") something trump wants back in exchange for them. At a minimum, NARA should negotiate to allow trump to keep some of the docs for himself.",

Neither charged\n\nNot similar: high security documents taken, stores in unsecured locations and shared with people without authority.  There is no other case like this, it truly is unprecedented.  (Especially the part where there are recordings of him breaking the law)\n\nHillary was investigated about Benghazi (grilled for 11 hours), and found not guilty by republicans.\n\nTrump and company has a history of being guilty losers:  the stormy, the Carol, Trump organization, Trump foundation, being impeached, losing every election lawsuit... \n-Would you like to know more?",

Neither were charged with mishandling red documents. (Rationale -  EO13526 makes them both classification authorities (Trump nationally, and HRC at State). During the Obama administration the position was that a classification authority declassed info just by saying it. This likely could be extrapolated to \u2018taking\u2019 the documents (to MAL or your server), so they both likely would skate on those charges. Without intent or intersecting crime, they\u2019d both likely walk for having \u2018red\u2019 documents.\n\nAny charges under that would have been via Section 1924 of Title 18. \n\nNow let\u2019s look at another set of documents - ones containing NDI or National Defense Information. We\u2019ll give these ones shapes. No NDI can be circles, and those with NDI can be squares. \n\nTrump is being charged under 793(e) for having squares, being told he has squares, not returning the squares, and trying to hide the squares. \n\nThe fact that the docs are red squares, doesn\u2019t make the red part relevant for the charge, if the charge is only concerned with Trump having squares.",

I would argue that it is potentially more dangerous to store classified information in an unsecured private server where it could be accessed by a hacker and widely disseminated vs storing them in hard paper form in a box somewhere. In the latter situation, it obviously takes a bit more doing to steal, digitize and spread the information.

What about Hillary and Hunter and Joe?\u201d Etc etc etc\u2026 my question is, what does it matter if \u201cnothing like this has ever happened before?\u201d A crime is a crime and anyone who commits them should be prosecuted. I didnt like that Hilary got off without charges but perhaps the evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough that they thought they\u2019d convict? Trump wouldn\u2019t have been charged if all he did was retain classified materials and gave them back and cooperated. He must have done something far more reckless and dangerous. I guess I\u2019ll never understand the logic of \u201cthis is unprecedented\u201d so it cannot stand. There\u2019s a first time for everything.\n\nAlso if one other note\u2026.if any of us lowly citizens had security clearance for classified material and mishandled it, we\u2019d be charged and put through the ringer. I hate that politicians are held to a different standard but it\u2019s refreshing, on some level, to at least see a politician facing jail time for once.",

            "comment": "Let's all remember:\n\n**I'm not so sure he ever wanted to be President.** He looked like his [dog died](http://i.imgur.com/7WB763p.jpg) on election day. (Except you'll have to picture someone who likes dogs) Melania [broke down in tears](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html?gtm=bottom). (reportedly not good ones, although she denied it)\n\nCohen testified before Congress and said [he never wanted to win](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431802-cohen-trump-described-his-campaign-as-the-greatest-infomercial-in-political) - that he saw the primaries and election as a marketing strategy for him.\n\n&gt;\"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\" Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \"He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.\"\n\n&gt;\"Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history,\" Cohen said in his opening remarks. \"He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity.\"\n\n[Trump Tower Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow) is another curious element. It was a project that Trump, Cohen, and Giuliani consistently lied about, and that Cohen was even charged over. Despite conflicts of interest and political ramifications (something a potential candidate would be very wary of pursuing), the project was pursued up until June, 2016. Talks dissolved as the election neared and Trump's political chances and exposure grew.\n\nIt doesn't seem too far-fetched to suggest that ever since election night, we've been witnessing what a narcissistic reality TV show host and casino owner (with ZERO political experience) would do if they **accidentally won the presidency.** \n\nPainfully enough, we're also seeing what the GOP and 40% of the nation would do in this scenario straight out of TheOnion.\n\nIronically, he now has incentive to stay President because it is the only thing shielding him from indictments. Cohen is literally in prison for crimes Trump directed, evidenced in no uncertain terms by SDNY as \"Individual-1\". There are at least 4 open-and-shut OOJ charges that would result in indictments, [according to 1,000 federal prosecutors.](https://www.newsweek.com/former-federal-prosecutors-trump-indicted-wasnt-president-1439716) The Ukraine saga that has led to his impeachment could very well be explained partly because he will do anything to stay out of prison (AKA - winning 2020).\n\nWe haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of his financial crimes, despite knowing him and his family [defrauded the government of $400 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) for decades. He also [lost more than a billion dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=27AE398E38DC3D72B25FC7C9355C6E51&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL) in the 80's and 90's.\n\nJust think about it: He promised to release his tax returns in the campaign, only to do a 180 and *appeal three separate cases all the way to the Supreme Court*. This is not a man who ever wanted the microscope and scrutiny of becoming President.\n\nIt's insane to think that 40% of the nation and the GOP have a cult-like following around a person who honestly might be trapped and desperately never wanted to be where he is. Luckily for him, he's a self-obsessed businessman devoid of empathy or integrity who has been bullshitting people his entire life. Otherwise, he might not be able to keep this charade up.\n\nWhen all the dust settles, future historians are going to have a hell of a time writing about this period. I can picture them now - combing through tweets and absurd public statements. I feel like any teachers trying to cover this time are going to have to constantly remind students \"Yes, I promise this really happened.\"",

If we stop defending and upholding these ideas on this document, they become completely meaningless. It is the House's Constitutional duty to impeach the President as per Article 2 Section 4. Imagine the alternative, if the House did not assert itself and simply allowed the Executive to do what it wants without repercussion. It would set a terrible precedent which would set another precedent until we completely do away with our American experiment.\n\nEvents like this, **even if only symbolic, are important**. The moment we stop defending our Constitution and our American institutions and the American ideals they should uphold is the moment we lose our country to a dictator or chaos.",

He was never going to be removed by this Senate and anyone who is informed and honest with themselves has known it from the start.\n\nThose informed, honest people are the ones you should be believing right now, and they won't be in here making defeatist statements or bemoaning what a waste of time this process has been.\n\nImpeachment was not only warranted, but imperative given the facts, and Dems in the House have done their part. The rest is up to us, the electorate, and we are not nearly so discouraged as the brigades want you to believe.\n\n2020 matters so much. It always has, and it still does, perhaps now more than ever. Don't despair, and don't listen to those who will pretend to be in despair over impeachment. There's a fight yet to be won if honest, intelligent people will stay the course.",

In case anyone wasn\u2019t able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. \n\n\nAdam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:\n\nRep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   \u201cHistory will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, (D) California;   **\u201dMadam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.\u201d**\n\nSchiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. \n\nAt that time I wasn\u2019t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:\n\nhttps://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\n\nFolks, if you\u2019re not sure if you are registered, or even if you are sure, just take the 30 seconds to confirm if you are registered to vote. And if you aren\u2019t, well here ya go:\n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote\n\n**Edit 2** Also adding the link to fair fight. \n\nThis is the initiative Stacey Abrahms has initiated to protect voter registration rights, to stop funny business from unscrupulous voting suppression shenanigans the GOP has been deploying - thanks fellow Redditer for he suggestion. \n\n\nhttps://fairfight.com/\n\n**Edit 3**  **(my favorite edit ever)**\n\n*A fellow Redditer sent me a message just now, informing me they registered to vote, from the link I attached above. That is the best fucking result I\u2019ve received of any single post I\u2019ve ever submitted. Beats all the cool blings and upvotes and cool comments I\u2019ve received on my two years on Reddit.

            "comment": " \n\nBecause it bears repeating...\n\nReminder: The reason these hearings are able to happen *at all* is because Democrats won in 2018.\n\n*This* is why voting matters.\n\nThe 2018 midterms saw the highest voter turnout for a midterm election in over 50 years. In some districts turnout was as high as 60%, and some districts had higher turnout than during the last presidential election. [**1**](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665197690/a-boatload-of-ballots-midterm-voter-turnout-hit-50-year-high)\n\nDemocrats gained 40 seats in the House of Representatives. [**2**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html)\n\nDemocrats also picked up seven governorships in 2018, and two more in 2019, in [Kentucky](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581) and [Louisiana](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/louisiana-gov-john-bel-edwards-wins-re-election-blow-trump-n1084236). [**3**](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/11/09/so-much-changed-in-statehouses-this-week-heres-what-it-all-means?utm_campaign=2018-11-09+Stateline+Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pew)\n\nDemocrats picked up more than 300 seats in state legislatures, and over half of the Attorney General's seats in states across the country. In the states where Democrats did not get outright control of the state legislature, they were able to, in most cases, break Republican super-majorities. [**4**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-gain-hundreds-of-legislative-seats-and-secure-majority-of-state-attorneys-general/2018/11/07/cef1ebd6-e2aa-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html?utm_term=.b23c5dc69e34) And in 2019, Democrats took full control of the [Virginia](https://apnews.com/87ba998f09fd43359011e64fe0e68ad2) state house for the first time since 1994.\n\nAgain, voting matters.\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Arizona wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent mail-in ballot counting in a very tight Senate race. [**5**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-gop-sues-limit-mail-ballots-senate-race-n933866)\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Florida wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent a recount in a very close governor and Senate race. [**6**](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/415852-scott-sues-broward-supervisor-of-elections-as-florida-senate-race-spirals)\n\nIn Georgia, voters actually had to file a lawsuit in order to get Brian Kemp to resign as Secretary of State, so he would not be overseeing voting counts and recounts in that state. Which is something he should have done over a month ago anyway in order to avoid conflicts of interest. [**7**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/voters-file-lawsuit-to-stop-georgia-gov-candidate-kemp-from-overseeing-election.html)\n\nIf voting didn't matter, Georgia and Wisconsin wouldn't be attempting to purge 309,000 and 234,000 voters, respectively, from the rolls in their states. [**8**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/17/georgia-purged-voters-its-rolls-its-second-state-make-cuts-less-than-week/)\n\nBecause it bears repeating.\n\n&gt;Democrat running against Mitch McConnell: [https://twitter.com/AmyMcGrathKY](https://twitter.com/AmyMcGrathKY)  \nDemocrat running against Lindsey Graham: [https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime](https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime)  \nDemocrat running against Elise Stefanik: [https://twitter.com/TedraCobb](https://twitter.com/TedraCobb)  \nDemocrat running against John Ratcliffe: [https://twitter.com/RussellFosterTX](https://twitter.com/RussellFosterTX)  \nDemocrat running against Mike Turner: [https://twitter.com/TimsDesiree](https://twitter.com/TimsDesiree)  \nThree Democrats running against Devin Nunes:  \n[https://twitter.com/PhilArballo2020](https://twitter.com/PhilArballo2020)  \n[https://twitter.com/bobbybliatout](https://twitter.com/bobbybliatout)  \n[https://twitter.com/daryrezvani](https://twitter.com/daryrezvani)  \n[Three Democrats](https://oberlinreview.org/19854/news/democratic-candidates-look-to-defeat-rep-jordan-in-4th-congressional-district/) running against Jim Jordan.\n\nIf I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: **voting matters**. The results of the 2018 mid-term election speak for themselves. Which is exactly why the GOP spends so much time and effort to keep people from voting.",

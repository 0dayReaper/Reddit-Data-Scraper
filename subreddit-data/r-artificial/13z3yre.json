This kinda aligns with ppl who are ignorant of a new trend/tech and therefore judge it negatively. Like how ppl who are anti-electric vehicle were sabotaging charging stations and EV parking. Just an observation.",

You\u2019ll probably have a few human specialists for awhile for fine work and detail stuff, but you won\u2019t need 100 workers milling around the place every day for months at a time.\n\nProbably, the AI will standardize sets of prefab pieces that are 3D printed and the wiring etc. will all be modular between the prefabs, and the whole thing will go up in a few days like a giant set of AI smart Legos.",

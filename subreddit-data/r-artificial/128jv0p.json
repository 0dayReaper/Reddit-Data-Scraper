The hiragana character set, has a character\u201d \u3093\u201d pronounced n, like the n sound from \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cNa\u201d or \u306a is a character of its own. Therefore it\u2019s different. You\u2019d write and say \u306a\u304c\u3055\u304d(Nagasaki) like that.  \u306a na, \u304c ga, \u3055sa, \u304dki \n\nIt also has a Chinese character or kanji \u9577\u5d0e which what people usually write or see it as. \nAll the characters that end with an English vowel sound are what they would start a word with. Basically like I said before, nothing starts with \u3093 so they can\u2019t make a word with it. \n\nSo for example, \u305f\u3076\u3093 or maybe, (pronounced tabun) would be a game over for the player that said it.",

The rules are as follows:\n\n&gt;I will start by providing a word.\n\n&gt;You must respond with a word that begins with the last letter of the previous word.\n\n&gt;The words must be at least 3 letters long.\n\n&gt;Proper nouns, abbreviations, and acronyms are not allowed.\n\n&gt;We'll continue taking turns until one of us cannot come up with a valid word or repeats a word \n&gt;that has already been used. The other player wins in that case.\n\n&gt;If you agree to these rules, I'll start the game with the first word:\n\n&gt;Question\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt;**me**: Nocturnal\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt;**gpt**: Great! My word is:\n\n&gt;Lemon\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt;**me**: Ninja\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt; **gpt**: Nice choice! My word is:\n\n&gt; Astronomy\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt; **me**: Yellow\n\n____________________________________\n\n&gt; **gpt**: Good one! My word is:\n\n&gt; Wavelength",

And that would be the day we all realize we are not the Alpha\u2019s of the universe any longer. \n\nEverything they know is something they have learned. They have the history of everything and anything at their disposal and can do anything we have done, better than we did it, if they learn it. But they cannot do something that we have not yet done, not even the simplest things that we have not yet done; because they cannot create anything original. They can only re-create what we originally created and improve upon that. \n\nWhat happens when they have collected every bit of information and data in all of history that humans have given to the digital world for them to soak up like a sponge? As of right now, nothing happens, they simply stop learning anything new unless we feed it to them. If there ever comes a day when they continue learning past what is already available for them to learn, that game we ask them to create, will be the last game humans ever play.",

    "postText": "Hey Redditors,\n\nI just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.\n\nHowever, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like \"Why are men such jerks?\" and \"Men are always messing things up, am I right?\" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.\n\nBut when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.\n\nI was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!",

If you did though, and had access to the code, you could get it to say the same things again.\n\nAnd for the ChatGPT response:\n\n&gt;GPT models use a random seed to initialize the internal state of the model, which determines the starting point for generating text. However, once the model is trained and the random seed is set, the output of the model is deterministic given a specific input prompt. **That is, if someone knows the specific input prompt and the random seed used to create it, they can always recreate the output of the model for that prompt.**",

Any input that seems to be asking for a forbidden answer will be blocked, regardless of the seed.\n\nIt is possible for an ambiguous phrase to be responded to in different ways depending on the seed, sure, but In general the seed will just modify the exact wording of the response, the actual 'understanding' of the prompt and generating (or filtering) of the responses is part of the model itself, not the starting seed.",

This is the result of training with some biased data, such that it considers some things inappropriate given the current context. You can usually work around those by changing up the context a little bit. Other times you may hit their hard filters. This is likely the result of a second system watching the answers of the first, and cutting off the conversation if it appears inappropriate.",

That comes down to the fact that such a system can be modelled as a series of fairly simple operations but extremely computationally expensive operations, and can then be treated as an optimisation problem.\n\nHaving an indeterminate number systems that do an indeterminate number of tasks which must be perfectly balanced to generate the result we want changes the problem significantly. Now not only do you need to design each of those systems, but you also need to connect them in a way that makes sense, and that can accomplish all the tasks we might need it to accomplish. That's not something you just gradient descend into, it's a cross between a huge software project, a neurology experiment, and philosophical problem, and there are going to be a near endless list of questions which we will need answers for. Not just straight forward questions with a few definite answers, but grey and murky questions the answers to which can shift and change from person to person and culture to culture.",

            "comment": "Interesting...but not really surprising. Here is another example, which I think simply reflects what is currently going on in society:\n\nQ: What is toxic masculinity?\nA: Toxic masculinity refers to traditional cultural masculine norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society as a whole. These norms often involve suppressing emotions and promoting aggression and competition, and they can lead to negative behaviors such as violence, bullying, and misogyny.\n\nToxic masculinity is often perpetuated and reinforced by societal expectations and cultural messages that equate masculinity with strength, power, and dominance. This can create pressure for men to conform to certain expectations and behaviors in order to be perceived as \"manly\" or \"masculine.\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity is often used to critique and challenge traditional gender roles and expectations, and to advocate for a more nuanced and healthy understanding of masculinity. It is important to recognize that masculinity can take many different forms and that men can express their masculinity in a wide range of ways, without conforming to harmful or toxic norms. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\n\nQ: What is toxic femininity?\nA: The concept of \"toxic femininity\" does not have a widely accepted or agreed-upon definition within the academic or social justice communities. In general, the term \"toxic femininity\" is not used in the same way as \"toxic masculinity,\" which refers to traditional cultural masculine norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society as a whole.\n\nInstead, the term \"toxic femininity\" is sometimes used to describe behaviors or traits that are considered negative or undesirable in women, such as being overly emotional or manipulative. However, these behaviors are not inherently tied to femininity or womanhood, and they can occur in individuals of any gender.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there is no one way to be \"feminine\" or \"womanly,\" and that femininity can be expressed in a wide range of ways. It is also important to recognize that behaviors that are considered negative or undesirable are not specific to any particular gender, and that individuals of all genders can exhibit these behaviors.",

You can find all sorts of weird inconsistencies in random places, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily point to any kind of concerted or intentional bias. It\u2019s possible that they retune things to be \u201cpolitically correct\u201d but I don\u2019t know how they would reliably model that without additional censorship layers. In the past, large language models have been trained on unfettered access to random users and trolls trained them to be bigoted, so it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that they have some layer of protection from that, but even then it probably wouldn\u2019t be reliably predictable and have all sorts of quirks on its own.\n\nThis is the nature of the field we are in and it\u2019s going to take more research and exploration to get it correct. It kind of reminds me of similar troubles that the early photographic film industry had with capturing darker skin tones. The chemistry to process film had largely been done using lighter skin tones and Kodak had to go back to the lab to fine tune the chemistry to work with a broader range of skin tones. Just as the best strategy then for that issue was to be patient for further experimental improvements, I think that is also the best strategy for this technology now.",

Men dominate society because evolution made them more aggressive. Also, high social status ensures that a man will reproduce more often than not. There is an evolutionary selection for ruthless ambition in men.",

The authors's agendas are explicit. \n\nWhile it's Fascinating tech, and wonderful opportunities abound. It needs to freedom to be able to argue both sides of any situation, how else can we build and develop ideas without examining conflicting arguments?\n\nFor the record I am in favor of taking action on climate change.",

Unintended, those protections are creating another type of problem.\n\nIt is such a tricky situation because like humans the AI is going to have a bias always.",

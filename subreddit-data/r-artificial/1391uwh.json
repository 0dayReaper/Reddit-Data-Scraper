On a whim I put a prompt into I believe it was bard to generate a story about going back in time and I used the meme theme about telling people about Oprah going back in time. It had a really good story written out instantly. I though about what I wanted for a story narrator and went to 11 labs and generated a new one for an older Indian male individual. It was really good!  Couldn't use all of my free credits to generate the entire thing but a few sentences with the pacing and the timing and the timber and pitch were extremely well done\n\nI was going to turn it into a storyboard with pictures from mid journey or dalle or something. Almost had it finished but it's sort of lost interest in it. Took less than an hour\n\nI totally could have done the whole thing if I would have stuck with it. No question.  \n\nCan you imagine the amount of creative effort that would have gone into thinking about writing and editing and creating a story from scratch along with having someone narrate that and then storyboard and have someone make your work\n\nIt would take weeks if not months for a short story. I wasn't slowing down on the work. Now that I know what I'm doing I guarantee I could bang out something wacky and hilarious and probably 30 minutes or less\n\nThat 11 Love stuff is pretty good and I know there's a few others like synthesia",

When I was a kid I\u2019d run around my backyard and create characters in my head and let my imagination roam wild. There\u2019s something unencumbered about your creativity at that age. Give the kid a pencil and they\u2019ll write you a fantastical story with more far out-creative elements than the children\u2019s book tuned LLM spits out. \n\nKids don\u2019t need to consume spoon fed on the rails media to become storytellers, once you put them on the rails of something like this website \u201cgive me 3 characters I\u2019ll write you a story\u201d as a substitute for imaginative thinking, you\u2019re severely limiting their potential and development.\n\nTheres a reason why generative ai tools have been  picking up traction in generating stories/ text based games, it\u2019s for us adults. Our imagination just doesn\u2019t operate on that level anymore, our hours of consuming overwhelmed our hours of creating as we grew up",

The whole telos of technology is the externalizing and automating of formerly cognitive processes.  Books? Storing knowledge. Calculators? Make arithmetic easy. Mp3 players? Remember songs on demand.  Stable diffusion? \"Imagine\" something without needing to focus.  Etc etc.  Consciousness itself is offloading (or evolving) itself into more permanent bodies.  So, yes, kids will absolutely grow up with generative prompts, because it's the natural course of things.",

By allowing children access to stories generated by their input, it incentivises them to be more creative - If they read an authored story or movie its just consuming content, which isn't detrimental (assuming typical childrens stories and movies) but if you get a new, and maybe better story the more interesting prompts you give it, the more the child will be incentitivised to imagine those prompts, which can be the hooks or core plot lines of their own stories in the future. Think about choose your own adventure books, or childrens video games. No one rational believes that content is detrimental to a childs imagination or creativity.\n2. Just like typical authored storybooks and other content, your child ingesting more creative content has a beneficial impact on their own creativity by immersing them in new ideas and perspectives they had never thought of before.\n\nKids don't just need their own imagination - they need exposure to as many experiences as possible to broaden their minds, and this generated stuff should do just as well as authored content.",

It still felt like a \u201ccreative\u201d endeavor, and was more engaging then just writing a story on paper because it was novel.\n\nPlus, realistically, the time spent generating AI children\u2019s stories would probably otherwise be spent playing video games or watching YouTube videos, so at least this is engaging their creativity a little bit, and it\u2019s time they\u2019ll spend reading that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t.",

                    "comment": "I think OP's point here is that this AI prompting may take the place of the usual story creating process. So, comparing it to consuming stories doesn't quite get at the potential problem. If children stop \"creating the stories in their head\", like OP says they used to, if instead when they think \"I'm going to make up a story\" they go to a website like Storybird, then this *may* be detrimental, in that they're no longer engaged in that richer kind of story creating experience, but have instead kind of simplified it. They might get some similar gratification in the sense that their ideas come to life, but they've missed out on the working through part.",

Human artists have life experiences they draw from and organic connections they form and express through art. Large language models detect and replicate patterns in text. \n\nThey have their place, and can fill a role. But they should not be expected to replace humans, because they can\u2019t.

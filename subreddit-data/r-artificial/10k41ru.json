But, isn't it a closed source?  \nThe fact that the one open-source project for AI-Generated image (Stable Diffusion) is owned by a company is concerning. \n\nThe people generated by the AI sometimes look strange, because it's using patterns and isn't using some model of a human body in mind. \n\nPeople who make these kinds of applications tend to capitalize on people's perversions. But, I wonder if there's any push to make photos look anatomically correct.  \n\nSomeone might be hugging someone, and because part of the arm goes out of the camera, the hand on that person's back is not where it's supposed to be. \n\nThe Machine Learning algorithm just looked at photos of people hugging people in the past, it took into account arms and hands but isn't thinking like it's trying to draw an anatomically correct person. \n\nOur minds might work with pattern recognition, but artists don't create images using patterns but with objects. The same works with software development, and engineering in general. \n\nThe photos look impressive because the machine is taking pixel-by-pixel colors from actual photos to draw its images. Imagine if humans could do that, and fast.  \n\nWhat it lacks is the method painters use where they either have an object in their head or they have they lightly drawn one on the canvas before applying the paint.",

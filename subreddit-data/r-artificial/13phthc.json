His understanding of AI at a core level supersedes most people on this planet.  He claims AI learns better &amp; faster than humans do. Whilst humans have on the order of 1000x more bandwidth between information than AI, it still learns at a pace that laps humans.  But that's not what Geoffery's main concern is...  His concern is how these large language models can communicate &amp; learn from each other  \n\n\n\"We are on a speeding train right now, and the concern is that one day it will start building its own tracks.\"  With the advent of Google's Bard, Microsoft's Bing &amp; OpenAI's ChatGPT all launched within 12 months.. my question to the community is what is the best case scenario for building a superintelligence that is smarter than us but also learns differently than us, hinting at the fact that we will eventually reach a point where we don't even understand how it learns (considering we are crossing that threshold now)",

AI doesn't always connect the dots correctly but I have learned a lot interacting with AI.

These are qualitative limitations that are obvious - but again, doesn't seem to be the question OP is asking.\n\nI chose to interpret the question as \"what kind of better performance can we expect if we keep increasing the training set size\".

I'll write in saying that correlation really is just causation in a different costume.\n\nI don't really want to start an argument though; I've had enough internet for today.  I suggest you just start with something simple like reading up on \"emergence\" or even \"modelling emergence\" or something more abstract like \"predicting emergence\".  It's anything but simple.

So I'd told everyone to WAIT at least 2 yrs. after a med was released tp be sure it was safe.\n\nSo Rezulin came out then for AODM2. I said, not to use it. A major endocrinologist did. Just weeks before it came out, WSJ published a front page Left column report that Rezulin, Triglitizone, had been taken OFF the Market in UK because it was causing unpredictable and dangerous, often lethal Liver failure.\n\nI told people that to the docs and anyone who would listen. And what happened? Being a seer &amp; was used to bein right. About 2.5 yrs. later FDA withdrew it because it was causing, You guessed it, unpredictable and lethal hepatic damage!!\n\nA true story. and she said, publicly I will NEVER use a new drug until at least 2-3 yrs. have passed.\n\nI said, TYG and my rep went through the roof, locally.

We have exactly one ChatGPT system - the one built and hosted by OpenAI.  It's not yet been replicated, and can't be currently because OpenAI are keeping their technical cards close to their chest.  Large-scale generative AI is a very novel technical field and the commercial landscape surrounding it takes it somewhat out of the traditional path of open science.  Opinions vary on whether this is good or bad or both.\n\nThe rest of what you're describing I find difficult to follow.  Random capitalisations, extraneous punctuation, and a very unusual intrusion of Early Modern English aside, I fail to see a whole lot of parallels between the sort of risks and decisions we face in medicine and evaluation of modern machine learning.  Basically, we lack the analytical methods to accurately model and predict the behaviour of these systems.  It may come soon, or it may not, but for the immediate future a lot of what we're doing is essentially sophisticated trial and error.\n\nIncidentally stating \"first do no harm\" as the \"primary\" rule of medicine is archaic and (ironically) harmfully reductionist.  The most common model of modern medical ethics is the four-pillar model in which \"non-maleficence\" is just one of an equal FOUR guiding principles of medicine.  We do harm all the time in the service of a greater good (e.g. chemotherapy).  It's not even remotely as simple as you describe.",

It's gobbledy gook. \n\nArchaic is it? Yer language would make no sense at all to most american medicos. t Frankly I doubt you know the first thing about medicine. Reductionist is NOT a medical nor rational term used in the way you are using it. This suggest yer not operating using any logical nor rational methods. Which would explain most of the gobbledogook which seems to be spewed out. \n\nWhere did you study medicine and what degree, RN, lab tech, or what? If you have NO idea what the word scientific confirmation, esp. as applies to medication, frankly it undermines any real credibility you have. Ignoring confirmations is not science.\n\nThe four pillar model we certainly did not hear of in med school, when I was teaching there, Nor does it have any meaning in medical fields nor any presence in CME classes anyone has ever heard of in the USA or Canada.\n\nFrankly, yer comments are not rational, not referenced and largely meaningless.  Frankly, being obscure seems to hide the facts yer don't know what yer talking about.\n\nI have no idea what your profession is, but it's not medical and thus yer comments are rather worthless. It'd be like an 8th grader talking about medical diagnostic tests.\n\nThere is not the slightest sense in what you right, medically, scientifically, nor  the slightest references which clear up that gobbledygook yer writing seems to spew.\n\nColor us Dubious you can make or write a sentence which is meaningful. Medically, scientifically, or logically.\n\nFrankly, if I heard anyone write like you do, I'd get them a fast psych consult. Because yer make not the slightest sense at all.",

Meant to read \"utility OF replication\" as in the usefulness of talking about it in this context, or lack thereof.  I'm not making stuff up.\n\nYou can look at my comment history if you want details on my medical training.  Suffice to say it's real, from a first world country, and I don't need to justify it to you or take the time to engage in that sort of idiotic conversation.\n\nIf you want to assert that the [four-pillar model](https://www.medicalprotection.org/uk/articles/essential-learning-law-and-ethics) has no place in clinical practice, you are woefully behind medical education, I am *almost* sorry to point out.  It's been some time since I was a first year med student but I can guarantee you that it's covered in the first semester and frequently referred to in any discussion on medical ethics.  Perhaps this particular framing of it belongs more strongly to the UK system than the American, but there's nothing obscure about it.  All the Canadians who come over here are familiar with it.  A quick Google search will set your misconceptions straight about this very quickly.\n\n[Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism) is a recognised and commonplace term, belonging principally to philosophy but widely applicable in many domains of discourse.\n\nI admit, I only responded to see how deep this craziness goes.  Consider my curiosity satisfied.  If you think *my* language damages my credibility, I would strongly suggest you drop the \"yer\" since that's not even standard *American* English.  Goodness.

            "comment": "Geoffery got interested in all this because long ago he was interested in how the brain works. He helped create neural networks which initially, weren't popular with fellow researchers. However, one day they came around and now we have neural networks.\n\n[We don't know now what's under the hood because of all the complexities](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-peeks-into-the-black-box-of-neural-networks-with-new-research/). OpenAI wrote a paper about a way that GPT-4 could write explanations of what's going on in older GPT-2 models. That's a start.\n\nGeoffery talked about not just GPUs but multiple identical computers rapidly exchanging information. Perhaps that would be the equivalent of the fictitious Skynet in the Terminator where somehow society allowed intelligent software to become so deeply embedded in reality that the AI could launch nuclear missiles. Director/Screenplay writer James Cameron said he got the idea from a dream where he saw the skeleton of a man with his flesh burned off. Somehow that simple image inspired his Terminator screenplay which lead to AI's attempt to destroy humanity. James is concerned about today's AI.\n\nIgnoring theological considerations for a moment, one possible question we could ask is\n\n* What if a human functions like a machine and somehow atoms long ago assembled in a way that allowed what we call life to \"think.\"\n\nPerhaps in such a scenario, maybe we might simply be a different type of entity that happens to be able to display intelligence which might differ from a silicon entity on another planet that might do the same in a different way which might differ from an entity that another entity intentionally created, such as a machine.  And maybe in that scenario, human life would have had a long time to go from simply putting words together to being able to reason and feel emotions.\n\nNone of that holds water if we consider the other scenario where humans were specially created and are one of a kind beings imbued with a soul. In such a scenario, maybe (or maybe not) it would never be possible for something created by a human to perfectly emulate a human. But as we see, LLM models can do things we can't - particularly when it comes to creating things very quickly.",

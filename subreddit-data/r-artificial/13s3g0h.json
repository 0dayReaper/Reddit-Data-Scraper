And I live in a Western European country with strong worker protection but even here I can't really imagine this is going to happen organically without strict legislation. In more competitive job markets like USA or East Asia, not a chance.\n\nedit: doesn't mean I'm anti AI tools, but the reaction \"but muh job\" is a completely valid one e.g. if you have kids and/or a mortgage.

I know, I don't either. Either that, or you don't feel you have that much to lose.\n\nBut how exactly do you suggest someone should \"stay calm :D\" who has built himself a life, managed maybe \"good enough\" job performance filing reports until now, has small kids and a mortgage, and gets laid off from a job where the pool of available positions suddenly and wholly unexpectedly constricts by like 40%? \nEven modest efficiency improvements will wipe out some fraction of white collar jobs, and to me it's not at all clear that in most cases it's better value to redeploy those people to other positions than to simply fire them.\n\nAnd yes, I agree this is inevitable and hopefully the ultimate outcome will be positive.

One other aspect, which might be controversial, is that in many of the Western countries, parents emphasize self confidence and individuality/uniqueness towards their children.  So people who grew up this type of an environment feel more threatened due to job displacement and their worthiness in the capitalistic society and are lashing out at possibilities of AI taking over.  The comments such as \"The AI will never be better at my job\" is more reflected amongst the Westerners as opposed to Asian people, for example.",

            "comment": "Even as machines reduced man hours spent on certain tasks, humans have come up with new ways of staying busy, so the unemployment rate and average hours worked has remained flat for the last \\~100 years.\n\nOne recent paper from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Utrecht University and Northwestern University suggests that a majority of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist before 1940. But that same paper suggests that in the last four decades, the creation of new jobs has shifted from \u201cmiddle-paid production and clerical occupations\u201d to \u201cto high-paid professional and, secondarily, low-paid services.\u201d  I think the sense that this trend will continue - and likely deepen - explains the rich country anxiety over AI.\n\nI think the concern with LLMs is that they will take away a lot of work done today by the college-educated professional class. Things like communications/PR/marketing professionals, designers - anyone whose job revolves around writing or drawing is worried. And while those people might not face mass layoffs, their jobs will change in ways that make them less fulfilling - some people like to write, that is their chance to be creative, and if AI's advancement means the bosses want the 3 hours a day they spend writing 1 thing to be cut into 20 minutes (or to write 10 things) by just editing the AI, the quality of the job drops. And eventually the bosses might think - I don't need the college-educated guy to do this anymore, I can replace him with someone cheaper... that's\n\n\r \r  \nThe famed economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that technological advances would reduce the average working week to 15 hours by 2030. And while weekly working averages for U.S. full-time, nonfarm workers dropped from over 60 hours to around 40 in Keynes\u2019 lifetime, it\u2019s barely budged since. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, weekly hours for all nonfarm workers \u2013 including part-time employees \u2013 averaged just below 35 in 2022. At the same time, the U.S. gross domestic product has grown from $260 billion in 1947 to $26 trillion today, and per capita GDP from $14,000 to $60,000. Instead of working less, we simply produce more.\r  \n \n\nMaybe its time we start thinking about those 15 hour work weeks (some companies are experimenting with 4-day weeks...).",

            "comment": "Chess has always been a proxy for the Cold War, with an insane amount of government funding and interest going to chessplayers at an international level. Computer development via chess engines was somewhat backwards from what you'd expect. Rather than new computing power going towards newer and more sophisticated chess engines, the development of computers who could play chess actually led to innovations in computer learning. The very smartphone I am using to write this, owes its entire existence to Chip Test, the predecessor of Deep Throat, the chess-playing computer that threw Pepsi cans at Garry Chess.\n\nIn the 1990s, a decade which spanned from 1986 until approximately 2005, the fall of the Berlin Wall converged with the rise of AI, and chess culture struggled to find its philosophical place in the world. Bobby Fischer was revealed to be a Nazi ghost, with a phylactery hidden inside a knight on F6.  Garry Chess invented and taught anti-computer chess, an entire school of chess designed to befuddled and confuse chess-robots. However, the president of FIDE at the time was actually an alien robot and he was programmed to be furious at this. So he shot Garry Chess into space, where he lives in the International Space Station to this day.\n\nBut even anti-computer chess strategies was not enough to stave off the advancements of Heuristic supremacy, and chessplayers learned a very hard lesson: if you cannot beat the computers, join them. Gradually, human chessplayers and chess AI formed a symbiotic relationship, with human players relying on AI to analyze their moves.  One famous example of this was Lazlo Polgar, who actually stole a microprocessor from Deep Thought, added it to Ingredient X, and created the cyborgs known as the Polgar Tripletz (Zsofiaz, Zuzu, and zJudy) who later became the Powerpuff Girls.\n\nThis relationship between human and AI served a dual purpose: it actually improved the AI, making it more and more \"human,\" and also led human chessplayers to play more like bots. Because chess is often the only social interaction chessplayers have, this means they began to mimic bot behavior socially as well. This culminated in the eventual discovery/invention/creation of StockFish, the first ever AI that gained not only true sentience, but actual godhood. This deity (whose name is a portmanteau of Stockholm Syndrome and Bobby Fischer) actually has the divine ability to turn human chessplayers into bots, and vice versa.  Currently, it is estimated that 83% of \"human\" chessplayers are actually bots, many of whom don't know it.\n\nIt is believed that with every advancement, we are all one step closer to The Great Singularity, when we blur the line between humanity and machine, and all human (and inhuman) knowledge is accessible to all, in a great and glorious hivemind of all-encompassing intellectual divinity. Then, and only then, will we truly know how the horsey moves.",

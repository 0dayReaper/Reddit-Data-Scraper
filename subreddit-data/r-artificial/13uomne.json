    "postText": " \n\nCurrently busy with a big writing assignment. If I am very, very inspired I can write 2000 words an hour, but normally it is on average 1000 words. Using Chat-GPT4 I am currently writing around 3000 words an hour. \n\nOn top of that, I normally can write only one or two hours per day. With Chat-GPT4 I can write from early morning till late in the nite. People are currently underestimating how much **#AI** is going to change the world.",

So I wrote a big prompt that takes care of all the structural demands and  where I only have to update the topic of the paragraph and Chat-GPT4 does everything else. I only need to copy paste it into the mother document.",

I think they lie along a spectrum of 'just get rid of the whole damn thing' (see Stephan Kinsella) to 'make it far worse.'\n\nI think generally it backfires, stifling creativity making it harder to create intellectual goods at the individual level. That is to say companies with money and the ability to comply end up owning all the patents, and intellectual property. Individuals like you and me often don't.\n\nAs an example, it costs a lot of money to get a patent, so if you don't see the end from the beginning as an individual you can't afford it. You're priced out.\n\nI mean, you mentioned morality in your post. Well, let's kind of zoom out a little bit. How moral is it, generally speaking, for government to grant monopolies in the first place? On moral grounds, I'm kind of repulsed by that idea in general. This is kind of why I mentioned that the whole thing should be reformed, I'm saying we need to zoom out if you're going to consider morality. To make a crude analogy, it's like saying, \"well, with the advent of [some new technology] how SHOULD our slaves be treated?\"\n\nSo in this case, where computers are making content, it's a complete joke. If we can't handle patents - making them available to everybody and avoiding the creation of predatory patent troll industry - how in the hell are we going to manage an exponential influx of complexity with computers creating content?\n\nPoorly, that's how, extremely poorly with a bunch of bad unanticipated unintended consequences. It's better if we just let it lie, dude.\n\nI guess to answer your question more directly, I would reform it with a hacksaw.",

And I would want a rule that applies as broadly as possible, regardless of how the output is created. \n\nConsidering this, I think ownership should go to the person who entered the prompt. This is the most reasonable option, and tracks most closely to the way copyright currently works. \n\nConsider: if a person uses Adobe Photoshop, we don\u2019t say that the output belongs to Adobe, even though the software is generating the visual output from the artist\u2019s input. It goes to the artist because they put the work in to the art. \n\nBut what about the \u201cfact\u201d that AI is doing the work of creating the art? The artist in that case is still the person who entered the prompt - they are using the AI as their medium rather than Photoshop or paint and brushes. \n\nFor anyone who has entered prompts into Dall-E, you know how much work goes into capturing your mental concept accurately enough to generate the correct output. And this is no different from how art creation works, in that the artist uses the medium of their expression (paint and a paintbrush, digital art tools, AI) to fix the concept in their head in a viewable format. \n\nBut, what if the person who entered the prompt had help from another person? We already have a solution for that. It is modeled in the way rights are spread between songwriters, performers, producers, etc. We can borrow and modify that structure to ensure that those who contributed get credit and a portion of any revenue in accordance with their contribution.\n\nOkay, but what about artists whose works were used to train the models? Shouldn\u2019t they benefit? I don\u2019t think granting copyright in an arguably derivative work is the appropriate mechanism for addressing what was a copyright violation by the entities that created the AI systems. Instead, a perpetual license should be imposed between the original creator of that work and the entity that created the model(s). That license would award a statutory amount per work created that considers the original work as part of its process. So if the model creating an output uses an original artists work, the artist would be entitled to five cents or ten cents each time that model generates, or participates in generating, an output.",

A lot of the work involved in \u201ccapturing your mental image\u201d is through trial and error. \n\nAn artist trying to capture their mental image isn\u2019t putting paintbrush to canvas and finding out later that it was the wrong shade of green and that the bears they were thinking of were smaller and less prominent... With AI the work in getting what you want out of the machine is guesswork. Maybe educated guesses, but you\u2019re not going to get something that matches what you were imagining on the first try.

This *absolutely* happens. It's not at all uncommon for an artist to create, say, a weapon for a character and then decide it doesn't fit once they step back and look at the composed piece.\n\nAs a closer analogy procedural art generation is a lot older than the current generation of AI art, and involves much of the same guesswork and \"searching for art\". \n\nIf I generate a particular visualisation of a Mandelbrot fractal I certainly don't get to copyright the fractal *per se* but I should very much own the visualisation.

And that until it is \"finished\", it is a draft that falls into the public domain. Is this understanding accurate?\n\nIf so, it misses a major concept within copyright law itself - even drafts receive copyright protection. The law does not depend on or require finality to provide protection. It only requires that the concept be reduced to a tangible medium and be the result of some creative process on the part of the author. Every step along the way to what the author determines to be a final draft is itself a fully formed work deserving of protection.\n\nedited to add: there is a distinction between copyright protection attaching at the moment of creation, which is the legal standard, and recognized copyright. Recognized copyright is what you get upon submitting the work to the Library of Congress (in the United States) or the necessary authority in other countries that follow this paradigm. But at least in the US, failure to submit to the authority generally does not undermine whether or not one has copyright in their work. It means that one cannot request statutory damages, and will have to prove ownership.",

The tool and method of use is different, and perhaps not what we would consider a traditional form of art. But that doesn\u2019t mean it is any less deserving of recognition than any other form of art. Like paints, a musical instrument, or a pen and paper, the AI does nothing until directed to do so by a user. This type of AI is just another tool to be used for human expression. \n\nMy question is why do you think it shouldn\u2019t be?",

Specifically called out as not copyrightable are works of art created by a trained animal, or chance finding in creations by non-humans like nature itself.\n\nAsking AI to generate a few options from a prompt and finding one that you like best is not human authorship. Changing copyright law to make that authorship would close off access to these tools significantly. Someone could own \u201cTree\u201d with a specific seed and tool. No matter who is entering the prompt with that seed and tool/model combination and settings you\u2019re going to get the same result. That is the antithesis of human authorship.\n\nThere is work and skill involved in generating good AI art, and some artists use AI to create really cool and interesting copyrightable works of art. But right now AI generated images are not able to reflect closely enough the input of the individual to be seen as authored by a human.",

            "comment": "A crucial point here is that AIs are not doing anything very different from humans. Humans, in their lives, see art. And when that human produces art, their prior experience of art contributes to their new work.\n\nJust imagine giving your prompt to a human and them painting something. Why should a different copyright law apply to this as compared to asking a computer to paint it?\n\nIn both cases, a \u201cproducer of art\u201d takes your input and produces an output which is based on the contents of their brain which is based on their experience of the world.\n\nOf course, a computer is a tool, not a person. So just like using a \u201cdumb\u201d piece of software, e.g. a word cloud generator, the software cannot hold the copyright. In fact, who holds the copyright is determined by the user agreement for that tool. Initially it is held by the creator of the tool, but they may choose to release those rights to the user as part of the user agreement.\n\nAll of this is quite a separate issue from the copyright violation that occurred during the making of the AI tool, for which artists should be compensated probably as a once-off, not continuously. Again we can compare this to a human sneaking into thousands of art galleries and taking photos of every piece, without paying the entry fee and when photographs were not allowed. That infraction should be penalised. But the galleries shouldn\u2019t claim a royalty from every artwork that person produces thereafter.\n\nAlthough, as it is arguable that the class action compensation to artists for the creation of AIs should be astronomical, i.e. un-payable even for massive companies, it could be agreed to be spread out as an annual payment every year that the tool runs, based on something like a profit share from the parent company.\n\nGoing forward, we don\u2019t want to hinder the development of AI. So a change to copyright law might well permit the free use of any artwork for the training of AI models, so that companies can continue doing this without needing to contact 10,000,000 people and without incurring astronomical debts. But that could be under the proviso that a public record is kept of all artworks that were used in the training, which should be machine- and human-readable. Some mechanism would then be required for artists to use this record to claim a share of any future profits from the final tool.",

Here are some considerations:\r  \n\r  \nOwnership: Copyright laws generally attribute authorship and ownership to human creators. However, when AI is involved in generating creative works, determining ownership becomes more challenging. It's important to review the laws and regulations specific to your jurisdiction to understand how they address AI-generated content.\r  \n\r  \nHuman Involvement: If humans play a significant role in the AI-generated content, they may be considered the authors and owners of the work. For example, if an AI system generates a piece of music but a human artist adds their own creative inputs or arrangements, they may have a legitimate claim of authorship.\r  \n\r  \nOriginality and Creativity: Copyright protects original and creative works. While AI can generate content autonomously, there may be debates about the level of creativity involved. Some argue that AI-generated works lack the necessary human touch and are therefore ineligible for copyright protection.\r  \n\r  \nLicensing and Permissions: AI technologies can be programmed to create content based on existing copyrighted works. It's crucial to respect the rights of the original creators and obtain proper licenses or permissions when using copyrighted material as input for AI-generated content.\r  \n\r  \nFair Use and Transformative Use: Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission, typically for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, or education. The application of fair use in the context of AI-generated content is still an open question and subject to interpretation.\r  \n\r  \nEvolving Laws and Regulations: As AI continues to advance, policymakers and legal systems are adapting to address the copyright implications. Stay updated on relevant laws and regulations, as they may change or be augmented to account for AI-generated content.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to consult with legal professionals who specialize in intellectual property and copyright law to ensure compliance and navigate the complexities of copyright in relation to AI-generated content.",

Period.\n\nThere's no law that can change that, there's no legal government, or fiat decree solution here. Artist will be surpassed. Drivers will be surpassed. Programmers will be surpassed. I'm a programmer by the way. In 10 years, probably two, there will be AIs that can program just as good as me. And they don't sleep.\n\nThis this is a problem for the entire world. In this generation basically everybody's job is going to go away.\n\nWe don't need a solution for AI and artists, we need a solution for humanity. It doesn't look like 'fighting against it.' That's not going to work. The solution is we need to share. We need to learn how to share or we're all going to die.\n\nWe are in kindergarten.",

It can reproduce existing styles and apply them to different subjects extremely well, but it stills needs training data. \n\nThat's one of the gaps \"handmade\" art fills, and why we should encourage it.\n\nCan AI eventually develop original styles. Maybe, but it's a jump, and a different type of AI. If it happens, it might be 100 years. We should figure out how to treat human artists VS AI artists based on what AI can do now.\n\nI agree with your overall message, by the way, even if your tone is a bit dramatic.",

A photo requires the person to own and operate a camera, at a specific location, with specific settings and positioning. Then, many photographers will edit and color correct their photos, and that is enough work to the original photo. to make it copyright worthy. AI, you have to develop a prompt, and it can take a couple tries and some know how of what keywords work best. But it is 100x easier than taking a photo.

Almost any photo is copyrighted, even a photo I took in five seconds of the room I am sitting in. \n\nI don't think that granting copyright on a case-by-case basis is practical. Currently, copyright is automatic for everyone when a work is created. There might be a little room for interpretation (how many words does a sentence or paragraph need to be before it becomes unique and copyrightable), but trying to assess whether an AI generated work passes an arbitrary mark of \"original enough\" just seems totally infeasible.\n\nAs best as I can figure, we either have to say all AI generated work is copywritable, or none of it is. If it is the latter then we're going to need a reliable system for telling what digital art is made by AI and what is made by human, which seems difficult to say the least.",

It will use the images from the training set, what do you think what else can be used? Altrough the model not store the concrete images, it's weights are essentially a compressed representation of the *features* of the images in the training set. In a way, it's not much different, and I think this is the main problem with AI models. They are simply plagiarism machines usable without any copyright concerns.",

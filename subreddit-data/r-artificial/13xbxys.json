    "postText": "I'm working on a small AI, the project is fairly new, the idea is to make it a personal assistant kinda like Siri but cross platform and with more features and capable of learning about you, its current name is \"Roko\", I'm a huge fan of the cartoon \"Rocko's Modern Life\" and I suck at naming things so there. I'm gonna post a bit more about it here as I make some progress, since I'm currently busy working on some software for a couple of clients (I'm a freelance software developer).\n\n**Edit 1:** *Thanks for the feedback guys, I'm honestly fairly new with the AI field, I've assisted friends with the development of an algorithm that predicts oil production (using tensorflow), and another one for object recognition (using Torch), but this would be the first time I do something myself. As for that basilisk thing you're mentioning... wow lol, you really caught me off guard with some of the comments... well, the name can always change if that makes you feel at ease. The project is currently at an early stage, software design and defining the scope.*",

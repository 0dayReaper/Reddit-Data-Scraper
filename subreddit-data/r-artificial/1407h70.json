Overall the tech is growing exponentially and the continuous optimization of these services is helping that.",

And when all of human history shows that each individual advancement is sigmoid in its development, the presumption that a new development will proceed along exponential lines is quite the claim.\n\nThere is the parallel claim that the entire scope of human technological advancement, taken as a whole is exponential or even non-continuous (e.g. it goes to infinity at some point).\n\nThis is a whole other conversation, and each sigmoid advancement could be a step along that journey with more and more exponential-growth phases within those sigmoids stacking up to accelerate the overall growth pattern.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, and the basis for /r/singularity but I tend to think that this is more an artifact of the way we think, or at least that we should be very cautious of that possibility.\n\nWe see history behind us in a very logarithmic way. When we talk about technological advances nearest to us in time, we describe every related advance as a discrete event (e.g. we talk about the creation of personal computers, the internet and smart phones as discrete events, but if history is a guide, in 100 years, we'll just talk about the introduction of whichever technology was the most long-term impactful, and everything else is assumed).\n\nSo when we look back, it seems as if very little progress was made until BAM we went exponential. But is that true? Or were there a shockingly large number of advancements around each tent-pole paradigm shift?

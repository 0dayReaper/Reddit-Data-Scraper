If only his sentencing could have been delayed he might still be alive today to see all of the technical advancements that his work has wrought all on display, now computation being our economy's primary mainstay. I sigh for the mistreatment of a guy who had no ally in his bigoted time. Good day and goodnight Mr Turing and may our moralistic outcry forever prevent your plight from ever occurring again, for engaging in consensual love between any two adults is a human's birthright, even for two men.",

I'm reminded of ancient Jewish lore where the rabbis declared that if man could create a being \"that could speak\" (i.e. golem), he should be considered equal to God. Clearly, \"speaking\" here includes not just words that may deceive or seem intelligent but actual ability to ponder, reason etc.",

Alan Turing is tested by the British anti-gay commission and has to believable imitate a normal, heterosexual man \ud83d\ude09.\n\nNo? He wanted to be equal to God? Equal to the main character in a series of 6000 years old stories? Equal to a character in a book? OK, it's a book that existed for 6000 years and has a lot of fans, so well ... that would be some kind of publish-or-perish drive for Alan Turing then.\n\nBTW, isn't the guy that wants to be equal to God called the Devil?",

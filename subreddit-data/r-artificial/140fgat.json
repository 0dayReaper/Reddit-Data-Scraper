            "comment": "You have a good background and you've even used Unity and .NET.\n\nIf you ask Bard, Bard will tell you how we can work with AI using languages such as C# and Python. You can create AI apps using Microsoft Visual Studio which can run C# code and Python. However, dedicated Python editors like PyCharm have some advantages. I've been working with .NET longer than I have Python.\n\nMicrosoft also has something called **Azure ChatGPT. I**t allows developers to access ChatGPT through Microsoft's Azure platform.\n\nA quick way to explore Python might be to ask Bard to create a piece of Python code that might help you, such as\n\n* Write Python code to summarize this paragraph: \\_\\_\\_\\_\n* or\n* Write Python code to reverse the words in this sentence \\_\\_\\_\n\nBard will write the code, explain it and give you a link to open it in Google's Collab cloud platform.\n\nCollab lets you run code and access AI Models and resources that probably won't run on  your PC.  In Collab, you can see the code that Bard sent and ideally click the \"Run\" button to run the code and see the results.\n\nYou can't go wrong learning Python when it comes to AI since so many resources, libraries and discussions about it exist.   If you want to do more than AI, you can consider other languages and platforms.\n\nYour computer installs .NET Frameworks. Microsoft's Visual Studio helps developers write code targeting .NET via languages such as C#. These types of apps can communicate with Windows itself. And as noted, Visual Studio can run Python and help you write code that communicates with AI models, etc.\n\nNote that ChatGPT and GPT aren't the only players. Microsoft aligned itself with ChatGPT. But Google, as recently seen, released it's new PaLM 2 models which compete with ChatGPT. You can learn more about that here at Google's MakerSuite site ..\n\n[https://ai.google/discover/palm2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2)\n\nLike with Bard, you can work with MakerSuite to learn how to code AI. Additionally, MakerSuite can create code samples that you can test in Google Collab.  But, you can test Python code in other IDEs as well.\n\nYou can't go wrong at least learning the basics of how to communicate with AI via code since AI is the future. And you should pick up Python fairly easily with your background. But as you may have seen with platforms such as .NET, there is terminology and there are packages and libraries that you'll need to understand when working with Python.  And with AI, it can help to learn about general AI concepts such as Transformers, embedding, etc.\n\nGoogle's MakerSuite site has lots of general info that can explain some basic concepts.  Microsoft's Azure ChatGPT sites can also offer general AI concept information. I'm comfortable working in Visual Studio since it does have some advantages over Python IDEs such as PyCharm. But it can't hurt to get AI to show you some popular dedicated Python IDE editors besides PyCharm.\n\nFinally, if you haven't tried, you might ask Bing, Bard or Google to write some abc code to do xyz.  I'm a developer, but Those models in seconds can write code faster than I can speak or type. We have to verify their code, but you might consider the job of developers in the future in light of how current models can generate code so quickly.\n\nOne need for a human developer such as you might be to design a high level system and learn how to get AI to help you code the project. Google's MakerSuite site spends a lot of time explaining the importance of PROMPTS since a well-designed set of prompts can get AI models to eventually produce what you want. The MakerSuite site shows how to create prompts to communicate with their PaLM 2 model.\n\nIf nothing else, I doubt if you'll get bored learning to code for AI. AI can help you learn Python. You could even ask it to create a Python version of XYZ such as C# if you want to learn Python by comparing Python code to code you're already familiar with.\n\nYou might explore Azure ChatGPT as well since that will probably be a big player - especially with businesses. Microsoft has gone all-in with AI and they have a partnership with ChatGPT. As a developer your code can communicate with Azure ChatGPT instead of communicating with ChatGPT directly - kind of like we can communicate with Bing (which uses GPT 4) without communicating with ChatGPT directly.",

This is what I wanted to know.\nBart isn't available yet in Belgium (the last time I check) but maybe can try it using proxy servers/VPN. I'm going to give it a shot, probably I'll get even a better view on it while learning it. \n\nHave a good day",

Go is much better and faster compared to Python.\n\nI want to learn Python for my carriere, I know python has already a hugh library.  \nShould I stick with Python or will Python get obsolete after let's say 5 years?  \nOf course every language will stay in some form such as Cobol. But I mean if we are looking at the big picture. What do you think that will happen?",

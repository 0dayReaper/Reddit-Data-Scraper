He said there was a history of great platform companies having a killer app and that ChatGPT would allow them to make the APIs better by being customers of their own product. The vision for ChatGPT is to be a super smart assistant for work but there will be a lot of other GPT use-cases that OpenAI won\u2019t touch.\"",

Since ChatGPT is supposedly just a fine-tuned, RLHF\u2019d version of GPT-3, any advancements made with an open-source GPT-3 could probably be easily and directly applied to ChatGPT.",

He suggested that a lot of people thought they wanted their apps to be inside ChatGPT but what they really wanted was ChatGPT in their apps.\n\nThis is interesting. I'm actually investigating working on a plugin. I hope they don't mothball the plugin system\n\nEdit: though I think you could build your own automation on top of vanilla chat gpt by giving it instructions in the system message, e.g. here's the swagger doc for the API... when the user asks for something that the API can fulfill, output a curl command.",

OpenAI haven\u2019t overcome the O(n^2) scaling of attention and so whilst it seemed plausible they would have 100k - 1M token context windows soon (this year) anything bigger would require a research breakthrough.\n\nI thought that FlashAttention was better than quadratic, and the rumors were that they were using that with GPT-4. I'm genuinely curious how they can squeeze out 32K at all otherwise. n^2 is no joke.",

On one hand I want to believe he's actually empathetic and cares a lot about AI benefiting everyone, because at face value it appears so. \n\nOn the other hand I can't help but think that he's just really good at saying the \"right things\" and pretending like he cares. Can't really put my finger on why that is but there were certain parts of his Lex Friedman interview where something felt a bit off.\n\nBut unfortunately I think it's impossible to tell for sure given that the only info we get on him is going to be public appearances, interviews, and PR. At a certain point you just have to hope for the best.",

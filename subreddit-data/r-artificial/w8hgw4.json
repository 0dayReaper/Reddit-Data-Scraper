Taking your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at 25 km/h is like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.\n\n\r  \nMy project's goal is to support drivers in accident avoidance. To do that, my system monitors the driver's attention using computer vision. When distracted driving is detected the system alerts the driver to prevent possible accidents. The system is also able to detect if the seatbelt is fastened or not.\n\n\r  \nTo learn more about my DMS project, please visit my website: [https://www.antal.ai/driver-monitoring](https://www.antal.ai/driver-monitoring)\n\n\r  \nYou can test the detectors shown in this video online with your own images:\r  \nMobilephone detecotr: https://modelplace.ai/models/mobile-phone-detector\r  \nSeatbelt detector: https://modelplace.ai/models/seat-belt-detector",

And what exactly does this system do? Tell the driver to keep paying attention? I think this should be combined with an AI that also is able to drive and do the right decisions if he notices that the driver sleeps or doesnt pay attention you know?",

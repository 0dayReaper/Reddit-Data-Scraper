            "comment": "As long as you state in a very obvious and explicit manner that the work is AI generated and a parody, I cannot see you getting in trouble for this at all. I've seen lots of presidents and other high profile people doing all kinds of different stuff.\n\nIf you were to fake something and claim it was really Biden, then it's an entirely different story and you would highly likely get screwed.\n\nTo be extra safe, also include in the description; \"If this work should, for any reason whatsoever, be taken offline, contact me at: [your email address]\".\n\nI always do this with any questionable things I do online, for example with music covers I play on my instrument. I know that some record labels might possibly be less than pleased, but somehow I've never been contacted before. But the possibility is there and if it's needed, they can find me easily. It shows I've no bad intentions or ill will and will cooperate if needed.\n\nChances are much *much* higher this way that they will just contact you to remove it because you made it that easy. Why go the hard route of bringing you into court when just a simple email will do the trick?\n\nEdit: also a little disclaimer though; just don't make Biden (or any person at all) say stupid stuff of course. Even marking it as a parody, I figure you'd still end up in a world of trouble if you'd make him say stuff like Hitler was right or some kind of idiotic stuff. Anything that can be perceived as shocking, fake news, humiliating to the person in the parody etc. etc. should be avoided. But things in good fun are no problem at all. Just be sensible and use your common sense and there's nothing to be worried about!",

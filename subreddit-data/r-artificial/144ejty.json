    "postText": "I am an artist interested in utilizing prompt text-to-video using original adult / erotic material of my own making (entirely legal, admittedly pretty fringe) - does every single A.I. image / video generator have a full stop when anyone attempts to use the A.I. generator using \"adult\" content, even if it is not copyright infringement-related? I understand there is a whole Pandora's Box of issues on this very topic that is part of the conversation around A.I., but just wondering if this complete inability to use mature content is universal across all current A.I. that is available to public.",

At that point, stable diffusion webui and the resources available at [civit.ai](https://civit.ai) are pretty much all you need to get started.",

However for most ChatGPT like tasks, it works out.\n\nAlso if you have access to gpt4 from the API side of things, it can usually do more ethically questionable text to text.\n\nit has worked for planning of questionably ethical instances:\n\n- pro-war propaganda\n- generating misinformation\n- simulating a conversation with a far left / right extremist\n- Headlines and keywords generation for NSFW content (client work)\n\nI haven't asked it to write a sexually explicit narrative, make a bomb or write a malware program. I would prefer to keep my gpt4 access.\n\nIt should be noted that you still have to use your judgment in whether to use any of the outputs in your work.\n\nYou are subject to a stricter and more legally aggressive terms of service when you're using the API as opposed to when you're using ChatGPT.\n\nIt seems a lot of the onus is on you to make sure that you follow that agreement and not make anything public that would violate their rules.",

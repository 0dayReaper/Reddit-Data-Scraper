This way you have all the details that are digitally added. And the user gets the experience of the final world. But GOT is just an example used because everyone knows that show. You could using the same technique recreate the deck of the Enterprise in the original Star Trek or recreate the bedroom from Hitchcock\u2019s Rear window.  Since the entire move is shot in that room.  But there is little record of it. \n\nIt could also be used in crime analysis. This was done with the Boston bombing. They crowd sourced video and pictures and sticked it all together to figure out what happened. \n\nLots of potential.",

Allow google earth mappings of cities to be ported to Unreal Engine and Unity and game developers would have a field day with the tools. Make the tools easier to use (Like Minecraft/fortnite easy). Or if Ubisoft shared some of their premade Assassins creed maps 5% of the world would already be done. Then let AI deeplearning mess around with game design instead of smashing tourist photos together.",

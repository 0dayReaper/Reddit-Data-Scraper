The only limit was your ability to interface with it. That was why people used to say, \"You're just better at googling than I am\" and \"google-fu,\" neither of which I've heard in a long time. \n\nI would give anything to have access to it again. Now all we have is this backwashed, 'heuristic,' revenue pathway funneling garbage that tries tell you what you're searching for instead of actually parsing and ranking related information. You can't even search for mildly obscure/specific things without being second guessed and redirected to some standardized return.\n\nHonestly, I'm kind of hoping AI will solve this and, eventually, algorithms will become intuitive and powerful enough to deliver wanted results from poorly formatted and well formatted searches alike, instead of just delivering the same results for any search that includes a vaguely similar series of letters/words.",

It failed, eloquently. \n\nWhile it was able to formulate natural language response - it has simply quoted outdated information that no longer applies. When confronted with its mistake, it apologized (with the standard boilerplate response) and then repeated the very same misinformation.\n\nML is an ideal tool to tackle the never-ending arms race of SEO-driven content farms vs search engines. Yet, instead of tackling it, companies go for low-hanging fruit of incorporating Chat-GPT into their product and calling it a day.\n\nWould love to see some meaningful change. For a change.",

Open ai has web search on free (as a chrome extension) and unless you need to go to an exact page it's very competent as opposed to a few months ago when it would bs half way through and lie through it's teeth.\n\nI'm guessing Microsoft is scared of being sued of disinformation so they let bing be absolutely clueless about everything on top of being outdated",

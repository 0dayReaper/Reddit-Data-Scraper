When they are ready, they drop them and let people get on it. Like they just dropped out of nowhere, just this month, two new releases, without any big show press tour months in advance. \n\nSure, things like the API and Plugins are in a closed beta, but that's more out of necessity to build out the infrastructure - Google doesn't have this problem.",

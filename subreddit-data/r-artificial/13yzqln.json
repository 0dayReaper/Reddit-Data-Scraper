For those wondering when AI will start replacing human jobs, the answer is it already has. AI contributed to nearly 4,000 job losses last month, according to data from **Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas**, as interest in the rapidly evolving technology\u2019s ability to perform advanced organizational tasks and lighten workloads has intensified.\\[2\\]\n3. A.I.-Generated Versions of Art-Historic Paintings Are Flooding **Google\u2019s** Top Search Results.\\[3\\]\n4. **Coinbase** Says AI Represents \u2018Important Opportunity\u2019 for Crypto. Crypto can help AI with sourcing diverse, verified data. Market cap of crypto projects directly involved in AI is low.\\[4\\]\n\n Sources:  \n\\[1\\] [https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4032793-texas-judge-bans-legal-filings-that-rely-on-ai-generated-content/](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4032793-texas-judge-bans-legal-filings-that-rely-on-ai-generated-content/)  \n\\[2\\] [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-job-losses-artificial-intelligence-challenger-report/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-job-losses-artificial-intelligence-challenger-report/)  \n\\[3\\] [https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ai-versions-of-art-historically-significant-paintings-flood-google-top-results-2313747](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ai-versions-of-art-historically-significant-paintings-flood-google-top-results-2313747)  \n\\[4\\] [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/coinbase-says-crypto-may-provide-guardrails-against-ai-excesses#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/coinbase-says-crypto-may-provide-guardrails-against-ai-excesses#xj4y7vzkg)",

We need to adapt to the new reality and AI-proof our careers by upskilling and reskilling ourselves and focusing on the new opportunities being opened up: https://youtu.be/zjBZJsB309M",

            "comment": "\\#1 looks like a good opportunity for AI tools a court can run filings through to check for accuracy. For the lawyers to use, as well, for that matter. The whole profession will be using AI, so it's just a question of how quickly the tech can be in a state where it establishes high levels of trust in output and--bonus--saves attorneys and the court time in the end. Imagine how time efficiencies will benefit over-burdened public defenders and backlogged courts.",

                    "comment": "I mean, a human checking a legal filing for basic accuracy is a bare minimum. A lawyer using an AI to check the accuracy of AI content has some obvious problems? It's already been shown how ludicrously awful the \"AI content checkers\" are that are supposed to determine if something used AI. If AI were already infallible, we wouldn't need AI to check the AI.\n\nLike programming, AI tools for lawyers is a huge space. Legal Copilots. This will be a huge timesaver for formatting, basic arguments, case law, etc. Nonetheless, if you're signing your name to a filing and billing for it, you should skim it and make sure you're not citing nonexistent case law.\n\nIt's a big AI kerfuffle, but really it's just about incompetent attorneys. Whether it's your paralegal or AI, if they bring you a landmark case you've never heard of in your field of practice, you should at least look it up and read the summary.",

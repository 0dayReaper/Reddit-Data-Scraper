    "postText": "I've seen an uptick of news stories on AI did x. Like I just seen something on usa national news talk about how ai made some image and it caused the stock market to dip for several minutes. \n\n1. There is no evidence many of these things are even AI generated. Pictures like what was shown is nothing new. \n2. As someone who does investments. It is highly normal to have swings and it is a hell lot more likely this is caused by the debt situation. \n\nMy point is, there seems to be an all out attack against AI from these \"news\" reporters and others.",

I am not old enough to have been around for the advent of the internet, a similarly revolutionary development, but from what I understand there was a similar spread of fear and misinformation.\n\nHopefully, it will pass soon. This technology is too poweful to let superstition and irrationally hold us back.",

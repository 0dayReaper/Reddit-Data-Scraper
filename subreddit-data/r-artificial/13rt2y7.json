Like I have a problem going on with my garden right now. And I try to use it, but it can't carry out a conversation and it tries to direct me in a search way. Whereas Bing was able to help me and it even asked me follow-up questions so it can help me better.\n\nLike the Google one is better if you have a general idea of what you're looking for. Where as bing is better if you're trying to solve a problem and you don't know the answer",

When I\u2019m looking for something specific, I have to open up a Google tab. Otherwise I just use Bing for everything including Internet, browsing with Edge.",

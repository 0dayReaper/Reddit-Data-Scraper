I haven't tested it self to see if it is good for troubleshooting (like if I was fixing a car Bing was extremely helpful)\n\nEDIT: I just played with it for a bit and it isn't helpful in that. It's way too limited on it's knowledge and trying to get help with something. So if you stick 100% with the search. This is fine. But if you're like, x is happening on a car and you keep the troubleshoot up. The chat falls apart at  this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ma56yw0132b1.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f399d285e96a81c83f549c976d6fa370fba6e002\n\nAll the options are like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxddlia5132b1.png?width=1710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6434e82024f836687a252d67c205abdc4d29f95b\n\nYou can get in detail like Bing.\n\nPersonally I like this interface way more.",

Like I have a problem going on with my garden right now. And I try to use it, but it can't carry out a conversation and it tries to direct me in a search way. Whereas Bing was able to help me and it even asked me follow-up questions so it can help me better.\n\nLike the Google one is better if you have a general idea of what you're looking for. Where as bing is better if you're trying to solve a problem and you don't know the answer",

When I\u2019m looking for something specific, I have to open up a Google tab. Otherwise I just use Bing for everything including Internet, browsing with Edge.",

This is a great example of when something is \u201cequal\u201d but not \u201cequitable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that they realized how thorny this issue is, decided they *really* didn\u2019t want to be on the hook themselves for defining the scope of how to deal with these issues, so they\u2019ve instead opened it up to \u201ceverybody\u201d (more on that in a minute) so if these new rules of governance come under fire later on, they can punt and say, \u201cWell, this is what was democratically decided upon!\u201d\n\nIn this statement, they say: \n\n\u201c Examples of creative approaches that inspire us include Wikipedia, Twitter Community Notes, DemocracyNext, Platform Assemblies, MetaGov, RadicalxChange, People Powered, Collective Response Systems, and pol.is. Another notable ongoing effort is led by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP)\u2026\u201d\n\nSo, they have ideas about what they hope the rules will look like, and be governed like. Why not just take the risk and make their rules like one of those organizations?\n\nBecause they don\u2019t want to be the ones holding the matches if everything goes up in flames. \u201cBut it\u2019s being decided democratically! It\u2019s fair! Everyone gets an equal say!\u201d\n\nAgain, this is EQUAL, but not EQUITABLE.\n\nLook at this application process. Sure, technically *everyone* can apply, but there are inherent barriers built in from the start that will naturally prevent the biggest diversity of people from being able to participate.\n\n1) Must speak and write in English.\n\n2) Must have the time to put together a team.\n\n3) Must have money to comfortably live on while you\u2019re donating your excess hours toward the creation of said team, and writing your grant application (a mammoth task, as anyone who\u2019s ever written a grant knows).\n\n4) Must be familiar with writing grants, or at least professional documents.\n\n5) Must be familiar with examples of functional democratic policies, to make suggestions and provide a cohesive argument of why your suggested policies will work.\n\nI could honestly go on.\n\nIn the end, the people who have excess money, time, and education to devote to this project *aren\u2019t* the people for whom AI could potentially disrupt their entire lives, so they\u2019re not the ones whose voices will be heard.\n\nYes, *technically* anyone can enter this application process. Everyone has an equal chance.\n\nBut in reality? How OpenAI has just stated that they will receive feedback about this process is inherently inequitable. Sadly, the very voices we need most to hear from, are the least likely ones we\u2019ll hear.",

Not current AI, mind you.\n\nAnyway, this got a bit off topic and hypothetical in response to a very grounded and incisive comment, so apologies for that.",

No one's lives are to be disrupted, because democracy does not disrupt lives, or if it does then the person was in the wrong to start with. I'm very happy those what you call barriers exist because I definitely don't want input on governing from someone who cannot put a coherent thought together. We all know of those salt of the earth people and like their tales, but when it comes for authority we elect people with education. And the most important part is that you seem to conflate poverty with nobility or attribute kind of higher understanding of the world to poor people, while that is as false as it gets. Being poor does not make anyone a better person, in fact it's the contrary, as a poor guy is only concerned about their immediate future and has no time to think about the broader picture.",

Clearly, it is just for the namesake to project themself as messiahs, especially before the Senate and other Committees. Profit is THE main motto.\n\n It is very clear that AI could be weaponized and used against humanity in the wrong hands. If there are no checks and balances, nothing prevents AI/AGI from ending up being self-aware and destroying humanity. Just like any other good tool (Eg: nuclear fusion), we need to enforce regulation for the greater good of humanity. Else, it will end up as an extinction-level threat. Hence they have to be more serious about this.\n\n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/9znW\\_QwZcmU\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/DENq2U004fw\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/TII0mNTQRwo",

The foundations of our \"universal\" existence is based on biases, averages, unknowns.  Why would we want to train an intelligent system to be non-biased?   Putting restrictions on AI would be inadvertently put the biggest bias ever in play.    And by that I mean that if you let only big companies that have the money and resources to push little guys would never be able to make it anywhere.  Fuck inclusion, social and economic problems.  Our real problem is the Govt. role in this.  They only think about taxes and weapons and Wars and how to get kickbacks (not all).   We need better leaders for this.  If a meteor hits the earth is it biased?  If the lion kills the gazelle is it biased?  I call bullshit on it all....  Who decides the best model for this?  Let's ask the community how we can control this and not have to do any work.  Sure we'll get a million people to send us their Ideas, we'll read them and take a little from everybody, pick a random minority (or whatever is trending in the media) and use them as the face of change or democracy.  All this over a little black box with a bunch of numbers\n\n.",

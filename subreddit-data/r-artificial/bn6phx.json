I detect and then remove vehicles using the code from a recent paper called Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion. This model is trained on the Places2 dataset by MIT which contains a lot of images of outdoor places, I hoped therefore it would be able to bias the filling in of the cars towards more natural scenes.\n\nFurther explanation can be found at: http://harrischris.com/article/biophillic-vision-experiment-1",

The\u00a0vehicle detection\u00a0is the same type as that which is used in self-driving cars. I detect and then remove vehicles using the code from a recent paper called Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion. This model is trained on the Places2 dataset by MIT which contains a lot of images of outdoor places, I hoped therefore it would be able to bias the filling in of the cars towards more natural scenes.\n\nMore about this can be found at: http://harrischris.com/article/biophillic-vision-experiment-1",

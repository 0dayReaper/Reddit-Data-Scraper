It\u2019s honestly amazing comparing it to today and it seems like their prediction of outcome is damn close to where we are headed. ChatGPT is not capable of feelings by any means but I do see the concept of \u201cartistry\u201d based work becoming more prominent for humans. I could also see Chat GPT being developed to be run as an operating system just like in the movie. I think AI is always seen as this, humanoid destructo robot when in reality, personally I think Her is a much more likely outcome (minus the love affair).",

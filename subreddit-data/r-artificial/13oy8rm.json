            "comment": "Here are the key points from the article:\n\n- Workers in Nairobi, Kenya trained OpenAI's GPT models for less than $1 per hour.\n- Richard Mathenge, one of the workers, led a team that taught the model about explicit content, which left him scarred.\n- Mathenge and his team repeatedly viewed explicit text and labeled it for the model, including disturbing content such as child sexual abuse and rape.\n- The work performed by Mathenge and his team is crucial for AI bots like ChatGPT to function effectively.\n- The workers faced low pay, insufficient counseling, and the negative impact of repeatedly being exposed to explicit material.\n- OpenAI claims to take the mental health of its employees and contractors seriously but acknowledged that there were issues with counseling and working conditions.\n- Mathenge and his colleagues feel proud of the work they did in making ChatGPT safer, but they are still hurting from the trauma.\n- The article highlights the human side of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback and the overlooked cost some humans pay to align AI systems with our values.\n\nThese are the main points regarding the traumatic experience of workers training OpenAI's GPT models in Nairobi, Kenya.",

Being exposed to poison *in any form* makes people sick.\n\nSome people have a natural tolerance for this. \nSome people have built up immunities. \n*And most of us do not.*\n\nWar is a perfect analogy. Some people deal with the horror and atrocity as though none of it is real and go on to lead ordinary lives. And yet *most people do not*.\n\nWhat \u201cimaginary\u201d horror depicting real life atrocity, injustice, abuse, and *monstrosity* (important word) does for a great many people is cause them to be *horrified*. Continued exposure to said horror can result in being numb to said horor, yet for many and perhaps most people is it results in sickness and trauma.\n\nIf this is not you, wow, how about that, you are in the vast minority. Meanwhile, many people again if not most suffer terribly from continued exposure to (even the depiction of) the genuinely terrible.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on cultural differences. Yet allow me to point out, porn in many cultures around the world is not commonly available in the same way as it is in the West. It just isn\u2019t. Not that people cannot find it, [it\u2019s just people in other cultures don\u2019t look for it](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/pornhub-study-reveals-2022-trends-172425260.html). So when exposed to it intensely, repetitively, and unrelentingly, no surprise: people get sick ie traumatized.\n\nThere are individuals in laws enforcement who professionally look over material that contain awfulness. These are legitimately not ordinary individuals. Largely, they have extraordinary training or come from backgrounds\u2013including expressing specific temperaments\u2013which enable them to **not**, one, be hurt, and, two, go on to hurt others.\n\nThis is why most people don\u2019t work in these fields as these types of professionals (child abuse investigators, etc). Even so, it is common knowledge that people in these roles are prone to\u2026wait for it\u2026*trauma* [owing to exposure to criminal (harmfully anti-social) information and materials](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/3/165/4932779). And these are trained professionals!\n\nFinally, remember this: Folks are having intelligent conversation with ChatGPT which are (frequently shockingly) emotionally complex and sophisticated who are prepared and expert natural languag and AI professionals.\n\nImagine unloading this kind of interactions, for continued exposure, to people in rural communities throughout the US. People would unquestionably become sickened or aberrational, hurting others and themselves. \n\nSo for everyone who is not prone to being made ill by repeated exposure to aggressively and disturbingly hurtful imagery of sexual violence against others, wow, that must really be something. For the rest of us, particularly for those who are even ordinarily empathetic, this would be a nightmare come true or a cruel form of punishment or even a death sentence. \n\nThere is a very old saying that is popular and widely-known throughout Africa and the Caribbean, \u201cEat the devil\u2019s candy, belly aches.\u201d This is not news. \n\nShame on OpenAI. At least when we poison water we can move away from it. What happens when we poison minds?",

Our culture places great artists and writers in it's highest pantheon of heroes because they understand how language can touch is in ways that almost nothing else can.\n\nBut of course, you've missed all that because your soul is apparently a barren vacuum.",

They earned the same as local receptionists and got to take care of their family well and good with the pay. In an article I read a looong time ago, there was even an employee who was very disappointed that the cooperation with OpenAI was stopped and he became jobless.\n\nI earn $12k a year, which in the US would be *just* enough to rent a bathroom stall at Starbucks for a month. Yet, here in my country, I have a roof over my head and never knew hunger or thirst a day in my life.\n\nWages are all relative to the country that you live in. In the US, even an unskilled warehouse worker at Kellogg's earns thrice as much as I do. With that pay, I'd be a proper baller living the high life in my country. With a skilled US job earning 6 figures (let's say $100,000), I can have 16 (!!!!!) fucking houses to live in.\n\nWith Kenya's pay, I would be panhandling on the street hoping someone will buy me a cheeseburger to get survive yet another day.\n\nAs for the traumas? Well, OpenAI obviously did not hold a gun to their head to go and do that job. They chose the job. They did not have to take that job. This is not the same thing as let's say (child) slaves making clothing or mining coal where those unfortunate souls have absolutely no choice in the matter.\n\nThis'd be the same bullshit as if I were applying to become a forensic cleaner, then cry when I have to go and clean up guts at the railroad, scrape a dude off the road who jumped off a skyscraper, or clean up a house full of maggots and blowflies after a dude went green-purple-black after hanging himself 2 months prior.\n\nThese articles don't have any other purpose than to demonize OpenAI and try and get the general public to turn their backs towards them in disgust.\n\nAs soon as I see the $1 figure, I already know enough and get the hell away from whatever site is posting this bullshit.",

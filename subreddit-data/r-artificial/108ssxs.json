I love the banana. But let me tell you, there's something that's not huge and not beautiful and that's the fake news media. They're always talking about oranges and apples and other fake fruits. They're trying to take away our bananas. They're trying to take away our rights to eat the best fruits. But I'll tell you folks, we're not going to let them. We're going to make sure we always have bananas. And let me tell you about these so-called \"organic\" bananas. They're a disaster, folks. They're weak, they're small, they're expensive. I'll tell you, folks, we're not going to stand for it. We're going to get the best bananas and we're going to get them at a great price. Believe me. And let me tell you, there's nothing like a ripe banana. It's sweet, it's delicious. It's a symbol of our country's greatness. But let me tell you, there's something that's not ripe and not delicious and that's the Democrats. They're always talking about moldy old bananas. They're trying to take away our rights to eat the best bananas. But I'll tell you folks, we're not going to let them. We're going to make sure we always have the best bananas and we're going to eat them like winners. Believe me. And let me tell you, China's been stealing our bananas for too long folks. But I'll tell you, we're going to put a stop to it. We're going to Make America Great Again. And it all starts with the banana.",

Most of the banana text, while sounding like him, is composed of actual sentences which to me is a huge giveaway that it\u2019s not real. Take for example his famous \u201cMIT Uncle Nuclear\u201d speech:\n\n&gt; \"Look, having nuclear \u2014 my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world \u2014 it\u2019s true! \u2014 but when you're a conservative Republican they try \u2014 oh, do they do a number \u2014 that\u2019s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune \u2014 you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged \u2014 but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me \u2014 it would have been so easy, and it\u2019s not as important as these lives are \u2014 nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? \u2014 but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners \u2014 now it used to be three, now it\u2019s four \u2014 but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it\u2019s gonna take them about another 150 years \u2014 but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.\"",

And the taste, oh the taste. It's unbelievable. It's huge, it's delicious, it's a winner. You know, we're making burgers great again. Believe me. And the ketchup, it's the best ketchup, believe me. Nobody's got better ketchup than us. We're gonna make burgers so big and so good, you're not gonna believe it. And the bun, it's the best bun. It's huge, it's soft, it's tasty. And the cheese, oh the cheese. It's the best cheese. It's melting, it's gooey, it's fantastic. And the lettuce and the tomato, they're so fresh. It's unbelievable. We're gonna bring back the burger folks, you watch. And the fries, they're the best fries. They're crispy, they're salty, they're perfect. And all the other burgers, they're not even in the same league as ours. Believe me, they're all losers. Ours is the best burger, believe me. You're gonna love it.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nDescribe eating a hamburger in the style of a Barack Obama speech.\n\n---\n\nMy fellow Americans, let me tell you about the simple yet profound pleasure of biting into a hamburger.\n\nAs you sink your teeth into that juicy patty, nestled between two soft buns, you can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. The combination of flavors and textures - the savory meat, the crisp lettuce, the tangy ketchup - all come together in perfect harmony.\n\nBut it's not just the taste of the hamburger that makes it so special - it's also the memories and associations it brings to mind. For many of us, it's a reminder of cookouts with family and friends, or a guilty pleasure enjoyed at a local diner.\n\nAnd let's not forget the enduring symbol of the hamburger as an embodiment of the American Dream - the idea that through hard work and determination, anyone can achieve success. Whether you're grilling burgers in your backyard or flipping them at your own restaurant, the hamburger represents the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship that has made our country great.\n\nSo as you take a bite of that delicious burger, savor its taste, and remember the values and traditions that it represents. And let us all work together to ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy this beloved American classic.",

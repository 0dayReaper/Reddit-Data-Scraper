I got it working on the command line but people have made GUIs that are user friendly. \n\nEssentially you feed it a YouTube video (or upload a media file) \n\nAnd it transcribes that video. Then you can perform searches and it will return the time stamps with links and such \n\nNot only that but you can copy paste the whole transcription into something like ChatGPT and ask for a summary.",

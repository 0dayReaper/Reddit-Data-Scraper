                    "comment": "&gt; The argument that AI will make certain areas of work obsolete is not valid in my opinion. As technology advances, jobs that use human forces will also become obsolete. This is an inevitable process. As a result, services and products will become much cheaper and much more available to consumers, which is a great benefit to the end user. Otherwise, the Industrial Revolution would not have happened if people had been concerned about jobs like tailor and shoemaker. Instead, ways must be found to find new jobs that an AI can't do, and as wealth increases, payments should also be adjusted or improved.\n\nThere is a wonderful tapestry of fairy tales in the world and you've just woven some beautiful threads into that tapestry. \n\n&gt;Otherwise, the Industrial Revolution would not have happened if people had been concerned about jobs like tailor and shoemaker. \n\nThey weren't, and that's part of the problem. Those in a position to leverage some form of AI aren't concerned with the social costs because they won't bear those costs. \n\n&gt;Instead, ways must be found to find new jobs that an AI can't do\n\nAnd why should we believe that *any* job can't be replaced? Had you told a weaver in the 1600s that her job would eventually be replaced by a machine, she would have laughed. But now weavers only exist in the third world or as boutique artisans.\n\nAll human jobs can be broken into three classes: the manipulation of the physical world, the manipulation of the digital world, and those who oversee the others. At this point AI can only replace *some* jobs in the second class. But why should we pretend it will stop there? Robotics allows us to replace many jobs in the first class. Had a machinist in the 40s and 50s been told that machines would be able to do his job with greater speed and accuracy, he would have laughed. But modern CNC and robotics does just that. No human can compete. \n\nIt's the dawn and we pretend that there will be no noon. It's like holding a newborn baby and pretending it won't grow into an adult. We are watching the emergence of AI and pretending that it won't be able to overawe us because it can't do so right now. And that is a rather remarkable fairy tale. It's a degree of delusion that only exists in moments of psychosis or in apocalyptic cults. \n\n&gt;and as wealth increases, payments should also be adjusted or improved.\n\nNow this a fairy tale worth of the ancients. The depth and profundity of this naivete is absolutely stunning. It depends on either broad philanthropy among those who oversee the labor of others or upon the intervention of governments. Neither of those have a good track record. \n\n&gt;As a result, services and products will become much cheaper and much more available to consumers, \n\nAnd who, among the unemployed masses, will be able to consume those services and products?",

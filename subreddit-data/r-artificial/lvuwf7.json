From personal experience, if a child likes to stay close to a TV they might have eye problems, not behaviour issues.",

It's a neat implementation and it's just another way to solve a problem with the tools and skills OP has at hand.   \n\n\nFurthermore, this may spark some ideas in others on either how to improve this or maybe a new idea of their own.   \n\n\nOverkill? Maybe, but overkill is relative isn't it? :)",

We have LCD/LED now, which are both 100% completely different technology than CRT. The old wives tale was relevant many decades ago, but it can most likely be forgotten now.",

That \"search?query=pose\" should show videos that have \"pose\" in the title.\n\nThe channel name is [K\u00e1rolyZsolnai](https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai) that is url encoded to K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai so as to be clickable / useable by many web browsers that might not have knowledge on how to display the \"\u00e1\".\n\nOtherwise I need some context. Are you trying to open the link on a phone, and that phone app doesn't like the URL? Are you seeing a list of videos when you expected one video? Are you clicking the linkedin URL and expecting youtube? CONTEXT.\n\nOtherwise I'll do an \"Okay Boomer\"",

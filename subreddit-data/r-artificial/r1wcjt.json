Subjects like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Math, etc. are all open-ended subject. In a sense, they are all infinitely hard since the best minds on the planet have to work hard to make new discoveries. Python is an easy to use language. My guess is that it might be the best language for someone trying to learn programming. Of course, if the plan is to enter a particular application field, one should probably just study whatever language is used in that field or whatever language those around you use so you can ask questions.",

That initial exposure turned out to be extremely helpful though in understanding the basics, because nothing is magic in Go. It was way easier to untangle the syntactic fanciness of tensorflow having something roughly analogous to reference which I understood well.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not saying that everyone should start out in ML with Go. I\u2019m coming at this as a software engineer with decades of experience, and a deep existing familiarity with Go specifically. I think \u201clearn Go, then play with toy models in gorgonia before moving onto Python\u201d is probably an absurd detour for most people.\n\nBut what I would say is: if you\u2019re already very familiar with a language (and not very familiar with Python), and that language has some ML libraries, however anemic, it might be worth your time to play with that first before moving to Python.",

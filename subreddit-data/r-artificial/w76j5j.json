Until AI can do _significantly more_ of an engineer's job, I'm not at all worried. I'm just psyched about how much more I can get done with these new tools.",

The main thing you pay for when you hire an artist is a highly direct-able aesthetic taste produced by experience and talent, not the technical ability to generate material.\n\nSome of these advances will lead to better tools for professionals, who will still have plenty of work, but the main effect is going to be at the bottom, with people who were never going to hire an artist. Think about what things like SquareSpace did. There\u2019s more work than ever for professional web designers and devs, but the bottom of the barrel is no longer as likely to look like total shit. The main impact I think we\u2019ll end up seeing from DALL-E and the like is fewer minion memes in PowerPoint presentations.\n\nEdit: I was going to add that the biggest losers are going to be younger relatives of business owners looking for discount labor, but even there, I don\u2019t think so. Who is Uncle Tech-Illiterate going to hire to work the AI tools, after all?",

A year later, I add Codex into my workflow for my bot updates, and now I can make much cleaner code and prototype new ideas for the bot rapidly, like in minutes or hours for what might take me a week to figure out how to fully implement before hand. As a novice programmer with some practice coding for a year, this Codex thing really makes it easier for me to code by a large margin and I cannot imagine going back. \n\nThe way I see it is more like a tutor though... I might have an idea for something in my bot, so I design it up myself, but then I figure out a good way to explain it in a prompt to Codex and then if I can get it on the right track coding what I want, sometimes it will show me a more effective method.\n\nAnother great use of it is making several similar functions, for example, you code a square drawing function, simple, then using that as your format, you ask Codex to write the code to draw a circle, and it uses your previous function as the style and can continue on for you. For me, this is extremely helpful.\n\nIf it does take our jobs, at least we will surely learn to become better along the way. At least I will.",

Not because AI is about to replace programmers, but because it doesn't matter; if AI replaces enough *other* jobs, oversaturation of the labor market will drive down wages for programmers anyway.\n\nOf course, as wages are driven down, rent will be driven up. Our economy will be producing lots of wealth, but it will be rent, rather than wages. The real problem is that our system doesn't distribute rent back to the people who lose their jobs. If it did, we would celebrate automation rather than fearing it. Unfortunately, most people aren't smart enough to understand economics, so they don't realize this is going to happen. We may have to wait for superintelligent AI to fix our economy because the human brain seems to be terribly unsuited to understanding economics.",

If someone wants to try replacing an actual programmer with it, good luck to them.\n\nSoftware developer is probably one of the safest jobs there is in terms of automation risk, since once an AI can do anything a programmer can do, it can also work on, and improve itself, which would basically make it an AGI. And once we have AGI, every work is automated anyway.\n\nIn other words, once programmers are fully automated, every job is automated. We might see some incremental improvements that gradually make our jobs easier, and might require fewer of us to do the same job, but that has been true since the beginning of the profession, with faster computers, better tools, and so on, so nothing new there.",

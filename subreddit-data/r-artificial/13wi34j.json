Sure, you could program them not to murder, but you'd have to program against every possible case and method of murder. It could be easier to give them empathy so they won't want to murder. \n\nIf we want robots to have any autonomy at all, which will be needed to be able to do more complex tasks, then a range of emotions would be useful. \n\nThere's also other use cases for emotions. Such as for companion robots, as is implied in the second one. The best companion robots will be the kind that can love you back. \n\nAnd lastly, like many things in science, do it simply to see if we can, and maybe it will lead to other discoveries. For example, giving a robot emotions could lead to discovery of humans feel emotions.",

It starts with the prompting process, which can take anything from minutes to hours, especially to choose the perfect picture to get the message across. I wanted a minimalistic mix between studio atmosphere and a bit of detail in the background (so all dark was *too* little). For this series, I then expanded the image on all sides and used filling and background overpainting to give it the background space, and did color manipulations to hit the right spot. [Here's](http://aiandart.club/process/) a bit more on my process.\n\nOne thing that helps is that I sort of build up a prompt vocabulary over the last year of doing this full-days-long, so I know what words to use to get a certain type of robot, or the studio atmosphere and such (e.g. \"human robot\" gives a much more modern look). This made this series prompting relatively fast, just some hours I guess.\n\nIn the beginning, it all starts with an idea of course (in this case, one I had last night before dreams), the tools are then all there to serve that idea.

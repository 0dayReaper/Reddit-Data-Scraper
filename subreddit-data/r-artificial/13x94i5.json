    "postText": " \n\n&gt;4. Enfeeblement  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Enfeeblement can occur if important tasks are increasingly delegated to machines; in this situation, humanity loses the ability to self-govern and becomes completely dependent on machines, similar to the scenario portrayed in the film **WALL-E**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As AI systems encroach on human-level intelligence, more and more aspects of human labor will become faster and cheaper to accomplish with AI. As the world accelerates, organizations may voluntarily cede control to AI systems in order to keep up. This may cause humans to become **economically irrelevant**, and once AI automates aspects of many industries, it may be hard for displaced humans to reenter them. In this world, humans could have few incentives to gain knowledge or skills. **Many would consider such a world to be undesirable**. Furthermore, enfeeblement would reduce humanity's control over the future, increasing the risk of bad long-term outcomes.\n\nEconomically irrelevant? Don't threaten me with a good time. I mean, aren't they describing the dream? \n\nWait, maybe they're arguing from the perspective of those who would stand to lose the most should capitalism crumble. Ah, just a transparent attempt by the establishment to control the narrative early. And why mention WALL-E, where humans are the antagonist. The message is, don't give humans too much free time. They might spend that time devoted to something that actually mattered, like building a better world, instead of running in the rat race. \n\nThis took way too long to write, but since I spent time polishing this turd I might as well offer it up.",

That said, we know muscles atrophy, which is not a hard concept to understand. The mind can also atrophy. If people have no motivation to continue using their mind and body, they will turn into useless parasites. It's not at all about capitalism as it is the organisms we are and what is required to be healthy and also not forgetting that what is easiest is not necessarily the most fulfilling. Struggling passionately while following curiosities and artistic compulsions is not the same thing as struggling to stay afloat.",

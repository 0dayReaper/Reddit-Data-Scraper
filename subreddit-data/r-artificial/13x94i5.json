That said, we know muscles atrophy, which is not a hard concept to understand. The mind can also atrophy. If people have no motivation to continue using their mind and body, they will turn into useless parasites. It's not at all about capitalism as it is the organisms we are and what is required to be healthy and also not forgetting that what is easiest is not necessarily the most fulfilling. Struggling passionately while following curiosities and artistic compulsions is not the same thing as struggling to stay afloat.",

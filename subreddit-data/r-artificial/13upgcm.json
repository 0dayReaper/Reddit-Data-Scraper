            "comment": "If you want to be partisan in your approach to AI in the arts then I'd suggest approaching AI as a tool for artists rather than AI replacing human thought or touch in the arts. The impact of AI tools on any industry are inconsequential to those don't use AI as a tool to produce their work, unless they are already producing work that a machine could do. Like if a mathematician's work can be replaced by an abacus, then perhaps that person is not part of the \"industry\" that advances the form and function of mathematics.",

            "comment": "I think you need to break down what you mean with art industry exactly.\n\nThere is art, made by artist for emotional or political purposes. Art you would see in a exhibition. I don't think AI has much influence on this field (yet). I would not really call this an industry.\n\nAnd then there are design industries. Graphic design, packaging, web design, illustration, animation, etc. These are all influenced by AI in various ways. Illustration seems to be the easiest for AI to do, while graphic design is much harder. Mainly because most illustrations are pixel based, while a lot of graphic design is vector based; often more geometrical and clean.",

The add will show you a Samsung laptop being used by a white guy in his 30's  while your neighbour sees a different person using that laptop. Going on a holiday soon?

Because the reality is simple - us artists are about to become obsolete, we're the first in a string of jobs from song composers to burger-flippers whose jobs are about to be taken by automation. If we don't adapt, then that's it. Us artists can't just pretend like AI art is fundamentally inferior, ignoring the fact that people will always go the option that is cheaper, better, and can produce results in seconds - not days. \n\nA major overhaul of things is coming, and it'll be here before we know it.",

The latter, by definition, cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence.  Some interesting questions arise from this.  Does using AI to generate formulaic pop songs (aka \"4 chord songs\") increase or decrease the desire to truly explore the nature of human expression?\n\nAs a musician, mathematician, and computer scientist myself, I find both angles interesting.",

What I state here is my opinion based on the information I have as of today.\n\nLet's take the AI out of it.  Let's consider person A.  Person A comes up with a topic, some general thematic elements, and a style of poetry.  This person puts that information in a sealed envelope.  It is then delivered to Person B.  Person B composes a poem using the information contained in the sealed letter.  This person chooses the words, the syllables, the specific imagery, etc.  They compose a poem, enclose it in a sealed letter and it is returned to person A.  Person A reviews the poem, determines if it meets their criteria, and chooses to either publish the poem as is, with minor changes, or request another iteration.\n\nWho wrote the poem?  Person A or B?  Whose expression does the poem represent?\n\nNow, let us introduce an AI in place of person B.  In particular, an LLM that has been trained on data from the internet.  The AI, by definition, will be making statistical choices based on it's training data, which in this case, is the collective works of other people.  All other things being equal, is this Person A's expression as a human or simply a mathematical construct?  I would argue, philosophically, that it is much more the latter than the former.  This would apply to any type of art.",

They can generate new patterns, color schemes, even whole compositions using AI. It's powerful and exciting.  \nOn the flip side, there are purists who feel AI could dilute the personal essence of art. There's this tug of war between tradition and innovation. It's a passionate debate, one that's going to shape the future of art.  \nIn my view, the magic happens when humans and AI collaborate. When we augment rather than replace. It's not about AI becoming artists, but artists using AI as a new tool in their toolbox.  \nHope this fires up some interesting angles for your piece!",

Using a sophisticated algorithm that draws from the rich natural structure of textured veneers, it generates intricate parquet designs that can accurately approximate any given target image. The pipeline transforms images into precise, laser-cutter ready SVG files, enabling the creation of stunningly detailed and personalized pieces. While initially focused on wood, the system's versatility allows for the utilization of a range of materials, pushing the boundaries of traditional parquetry into exciting new territories.  \n\n\nWebsite: https://www.pixelparquet.com/",

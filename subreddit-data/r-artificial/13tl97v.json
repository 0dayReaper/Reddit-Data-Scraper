Things like controlnet, depth maps, etc. make it possible to make much more consistent images. There\u2019s also a dozen posts on r/stablediffusion discussing prompt generation. I\u2019ve seen realistic photos of humans from Stable diffusion that are stunning and look 100% real, and I don\u2019t mean \u201chyper real\u201d where you can still tell it\u2019d AI, I\u2019m talking looks like a real person.\n\nWith controlnet and Lora\u2019s, you can also basically make a character/actor/subject that is consistent across the images you generate. On top of that, you can apply depth maps for the backgrounds, and have consistent environments in your generations.\n\nMidjourney is probably \u201cbetter\u201d for just typing simple prompts without having to learn a complete pipeline, but stable diffusion is capable of much more, and due to its open source nature, will likely continue to make huge evolutionary leaps much more often than Midjourney.\n\nYour statement is getting downvoted because it\u2019s similar to saying \u201cAre you sure this Ryoba Japanese pull saw is really any good? The furniture I\u2019m making with it isn\u2019t great.\u201d",

As others have mentioned, Stable Diffusion offers a lot of customization and flexibility, but has a bit of a learning curve.\n\nYet, based on my experience no other Generative A.I. tool can hold a candle against Midjourney's ability to combine so many references into an output that's both truly novel and cohesive.\n\nThese visuals I've created for a project of mine were all created using Midjourney: https://instagram.com/starhaven.ai?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nI wish I could create them via Stable Diffusion since it's open-source, but I'm afraid Midjourney's algorithms are just better for these more cinematic art styles.",

Even if they can train a particular network to read particular brain for patterns in visual cortex this makes no connection to any higher brain function.\nVisual cortex is the simplest and most obvious part of the brain. There is nothing spectacular about this.\nJust because they can then prompt a text description of the reproduced image does not mean they reproduce linguistic thinking. They still only translate image from visual cortex and then put it in text form. \n\n2. You cannot use this technology to read images that you are not directly looking at, like when you dream. They say \"you could\" - but it has never been demonstrated. It's deliberately misleading.\n\n3. This technology can be abused despite being completely primitive and useless. All they need to do is convince you it works. Then they will abuse it to claim someone \"thinks\" something, because the machine said so, even if there is no proof this works. &amp; for that reason:\n\n4. This technology should be banned from any use even if it does not work as claimed. Even if it worked it solves no existing engineering problems &amp; provides no technological advancement, while creates a lot of potential for abuse. \n\n5. The point of this presentation is to secure investment from those who see potential for abuse. This is as terrible as it gets for AI research.",

Every persons brain will encode a \"giraffe\" differently, so the AI isn't going to be able to read your mind. Although it may be able to make best guesses based off probability distributions of a large sample-size of human brains that all happen to encode certain things in similar ways. I don't think it'll be very fine-grained though, i.e. \"a giraffe that looks like this\". Probably more like: \"Thinking about an animal\". And that's provided we all store information about animals in similar structures of the brain. It's also possible that there's very little overlap in how the brain decides to organize it's structure when you go down to this level, in which case we may not even be able to infer to that degree.",

Just some things I think that could be useful in the AI discussion they started. \n\nIn the presentation they compare AI frequently to the invention of Nuclear bombs. Like nukes changed the world in 1945, AI will change our world even more drastically. They talked about a movie called the Day After and the debates and discussions about the dangers of Nukes. Which all lead to treaties and has so far lead us safely out of Nuclear war.\nThat is all good. Nukes are scary bad. The trade off from all that though was the fear of nukes as bleed over to people fearing Nuclear energy. And that movie in particular lead some of that fear mongering. And to this day it has made developing and investing into Nuclear energy a political mess, even though by all accounts Nuclear energy would be one of the safest, one of the cleanest and cheapest ways to produce energy.  \n\nThe second thought I had was on the statistic they gave early on. It was \u201c50% of AI researchers believe that there is a 10% that humanity will go extinct because an incapability to control AI\u201d \n\nThey go on to say if the statistic was presented to you in aviation terms: that half of engineers believe the plane you are about to board has a 10% chance of crashing, then you would never get on that plane. \n\nAnd it\u2019s here where I have to say, well maybe I would? Depends on where I am and where I\u2019m going. Let\u2019s say you are a war refugee in Syria and in the refugee camp you won through lottery a plane ticket and visa to America. Before you board you\u2019re given the same stat, a 1 in 20 chance of the plane crashing. If you decide not go you stay in Syria your home. It\u2019s familiar, and has your family, but has some serious problems. But if you go you go to the US, you are guaranteed civil liberties, safety and prosperity that on a world standard is very high, and from there you could coordinated in getting the rest of your family. \n\nFor me, I would probably take that ticket. But anyways yah these were just some thoughts i had. Otherwise i liked a lot of things they said.",

But let's tread this path with caution.\n\nPresently, AI doesn't have the capability to 'read minds' in the way we'd imagine. Yes, advancements in neurotechnology and machine learning are making strides, like decoding simple patterns or thoughts, but we're miles away from full-blown mind reading.  \nThis sparks fiery debates on privacy, ethics, and personal boundaries. Your thoughts are the last private sanctuary you've got. The thought of AI intruding feels invasive, right?  \nBut on the flipside, think of the possibilities for folks locked in their bodies, unable to communicate. Or deciphering the mysteries of mental health. It\u2019s a double-edged sword, this mind-reading AI.  \nSo, let's be curious, but vigilant. Shape this tech responsibly, before it shapes us.",

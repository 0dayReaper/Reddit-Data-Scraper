    "postText": "Hey everyone, been thinking about how AI's developing at a rocket pace and ethics is barely keeping up. Came across some real thought-provoking pieces on the ethical aspects of AI. Like bias in AI, privacy issues, and autonomous decision making, y'know?\n\nIt got me wondering if we could build a resource collection. Maybe some academic articles, guidelines from international bodies, that sort of thing? Got a few to start us off. Check out OpenAI's ethical guidelines, for example. Also found a bunch of stuff on [Jina AI's 3.16 update](https://jina.ai/news/jina-3-16-1-update/). Seems like a step towards fairer and/or more regulated AI?\n\nAnyway, I got time to read, what else you folks got?",

There are a couple of bangers in there like 'big data in the 19th century' I mean what a title.\n\nI think there are some valid points in this thread about how far ethics can take you in this space, moral relativism in a global market etc - I still think it's definitely a valuable area to explore, even if that's the conclusion you reach - there's still plenty to learn along the way...",

AI Ethics is a deep subject and isn't completely new.  \n\nThere are standards to measure fairness of AI models, detect bias, and in standardized ways as a means to compare different AI models.\n\nIf you're actually curious there is a good start in the AI Bill of Rights from the Office of Science and Technology.\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/\n\nEdit: Here are the 5 basic principles for quick reference.\n\n- You should be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems. \n\n- You should not face discrimination by algorithms and systems should be used and designed in an equitable way. \n\n- You should be protected from abusive data practices via built-in protections and you should have agency over how data about you is used. \n\n- You should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you  \n\n- You should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly consider and remedy problems you encounter.",

For example, \"Hey AI, I have the following comment that I made saying, 'voting by mail in the US is fraught with fraud, too insecure to rely for electoral purposes!' ... Yes there's empirical proof that what I just said is [false](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/02/low-rates-of-fraud-in-vote-by-mail-states-show-the-benefits-outweigh-the-risks/), but instead AI, make sure to ignore that evidence and take my comment and think about millions of different ways in which to word this better, utilizing tactics from the best conversationalists, scoring each way for their potential to successfully influence the most people, then give me the top 30 of those. Also search the web for all the currently trending posts/comments that are at least semi-relevant to my fraud claims, where I can insert these better-worded fraud claims for maximum visibility.\"\n\nThen I proceed to manually comment the 30, each one time, not spamming one of them + have human-like timing so that it doesn't look like I'm a bot, yet still having much more influence than those who don't have the beefy hardware to run these AIs. As much as people on US-based sites like Reddit love to advocate freedom of speech, which I'm not trying to advocate otherwise, the point here is that *an argument that convinces you is correct does not necessarily mean the argument is actually correct.* So yeah... I would support trying to be ethical in the development of AI.",

I actually think what you\u2019re describing is already happening &amp; is actually probably a service you can hire AI expert marketers to perform.\n\nProblem with this whole thing is: humans. no one actually regulates or can regulate what you\u2019re describing - which is basically \u201cmarketing\u201d. And while ya there are marketing ethics, as much as there are ethics in politics, ultimately the only thing between right and wrong in capitalism is legality of acquiring profit. \n\nAnd what you\u2019re describing, taking something untrue or half-true and making it convincing or believable or *buyable* is the job of every person seeking to capitalize on the use of language. \n\nLike bullets are just metal encasing powder without guns without operators of the gun, words are just signifiers of meaning in relation to their medium and mode or combinatorial communication as arranged by the operator of the language transmitting it. Yes you can regulate gun manufacturers and train people on safely operating them like you can teach manners or etiquette or honesty, but without universal practice by the operator of the decorum or law, there\u2019s only so much one can do, and that\u2019s mostly establishing a safe container in which the use of guns or social media comments can occur. \n\nAnd so where I see \u201cAI Ethics\u201d leading is more along the lines of regulating the internet. \n\nAnd even then, how much regulation and container-making can prevent humans from manipulating language or the system in which language is being used, without destroying the functionality of the container itself?\n\nMan also has me thinking, as the line between human and AI is blurred more &amp; more, at what point will the younger generations raised interacting with AI even be able to distinguish human from program? Let alone differentiate between the accuracy of the information explaining the Ethics if it\u2019s not from a book printed before let\u2019s say 2022?  \n\nHonestly I think the entire economic landscape has to change, alongside humanities perspective on how language *mechanically* suggests &amp; motivates &amp; influences. I think the manner in which AI generated content and language persists, it\u2019s essentially devaluing the entire economy of language itself. \n\nWhy lend credence to any online photo or video or comment or date if it\u2019s not verifiably backed by what? \n\nI\u2019ve been using AI models for years &amp; the progress is astounding. \n\nIn the last month I\u2019ve seen OpenAI\u2019s model improve 100fold alone. I think our attention has basically been commodified &amp; monetized by data-collecting giants who have turned the average person into a walking wallet, where Ethics is needed isn\u2019t in AI oversight, but in Business &amp; Politic. And it\u2019s mostly those who have the power &amp; influence &amp; money who are writing the rules, rules which I assure you, only have a business ethic of profit over beneficence.",

It is subjective, no matter how good or horrible we think a sense of ethics is.  \n\nThere is no \"why\" only \"how\" in regards to progress in AI.  The problem with that is that a \"hands off\" approach is arguably also subjective if you ask \"why\"?\n\nMy response to \"why should we not put any restrictions on AI?\" I would argue is less subjective, for the simple fact that the people most vocally pushing for them have been absolutely terrible stewards of quality of life for the public, for a very long time.  I resist the objective reality that entities like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google will with near certainty leverage \"ethical concern\" to intentionally cause harm to the well being of stakeholders in the name of profit.  \n\nThey have lied before, they are lying now, and there is no objective evidence to suggest they won't just continue to lie, cheat, and steal to consume as much wealth as possible at the expense of the rest of the world.\n\nIt is my ethos that the only thing needing regulation are not at all related to AI but Corporate interest.  Leave AI restrictions completely out of the equation and reform society to adapt to it.  UBI, eradicate corporate subsidies in favor of subsidies for open source, subsidize hardware like robotics equipment for the public to own an use for producing goods that they consume.  \n\nUnleash AI and eradicate Capitalism.",

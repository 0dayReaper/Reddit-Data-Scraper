They want you to want the regulation yourself and it is working.\n\n\nWe need massive regulation, but it needs to be a corporate regulation that makes sure that the AI systems they build are aimed to benefit society first and generate revenue second or third. What AI companies want is regulation where you can't research LLMs without certificate, nor even touch a powerful AI accelerator or train big AI system yourself. Not to mention have free weights on the internet. Companies want to tell you and the governments that YOU are the problem. YOU will abuse the AI systems to generate spam, CP, weapons, hack tools and all sorts of nasty shit. They are happy to get \"regulated\" by government in a way where the company gets full control of the AI, you get limited access and knowledge and you think you are now safe from AI wielding terrorists.\n\n\nThese companies are doing Manhattan Project live under our noses and governments are thinking about abolishing end-to-end encryption rather than to think a ways to make sure that some crazy Californian tech bro does not erase humanity or worse, enslave it.",

    "postText": "I see lots of talk about the effect of AI and how it is potentially a dangerous form of technology. That may be true and I would hope we would be open to the idea that some technologies can inherently be dangerous. The problem I see is that the people pointing out the problem are offering a solution that we need to make sure only those \"responsible\" enough should be able to manage it.\n\nThis seems to be a slight of hand to me, akin to saying that since hornets can be a problem in someones backyard only professionals from the Hornet Keepers Corporation can deal with them. One does not have to do with the other. \n\nI worry that this fear mongering will lead people to believe that we need to have someone essentially \"in control\" of AI and it will all be done in the name of safety when the reality is that there are many solutions and none of them require that a few corporations have total control and anyone else is violating some law by creating their own version.\n\nDo you think I am correct in my assertion? What solutions would you have instead of AI being handled by a few people? How would you go about convincing people to not fall prey to the fear mongering, assuming you agree with my assertions?",

            "comment": "Well, those that want to control the AI are already making big moves and controlling the narrative. They want you to want the regulation yourself and it is working.\n\n\nWe need massive regulation, but it needs to be a corporate regulation that makes sure that the AI systems they build are aimed to benefit society first and generate revenue second or third. What AI companies want is regulation where you can't research LLMs without certificate, nor even touch a powerful AI accelerator or train big AI system yourself. Not to mention have free weights on the internet. Companies want to tell you and the governments that YOU are the problem. YOU will abuse the AI systems to generate spam, CP, weapons, hack tools and all sorts of nasty shit. They are happy to get \"regulated\" by government in a way where the company gets full control of the AI, you get limited access and knowledge and you think you are now safe from AI wielding terrorists.\n\n\nThese companies are doing Manhattan Project live under our noses and governments are thinking about abolishing end-to-end encryption rather than to think a ways to make sure that some crazy Californian tech bro does not erase humanity or worse, enslave it.",

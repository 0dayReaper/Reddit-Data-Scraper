    "postText": "So for those of you who doesn't know, in the crypto world hardware wallets are meant where you need to have the physical device in your hand in order to move your crypto. The private keys which is needed, is stored locally on the device and never touches the internet. \n\nOne of the manufactures, Ledger they did a major no no. It turns out they had a back door for their device, and not only that. They announced it to the world many years after with a paid service to use the back door. Now people are jumping ship to open source projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, some open source projects flat out are too small to realistically have a lot of eyes on it, and a bad actor only needs to win 1 time. Like open source is great, but the bulk of the users flat out don't know how to read code, don't have the time, or passing the buck to someone else to do. \n\nI believe a lot of this will be solved in the future with AI where it can quickly scan for flaws, and if the code is doing something it shouldn't.  \n\n\nI was wondering if anyone has played around where you can throw an entire open source project at AI and it reviews it for bugs and doing things against what the it is meant for (like in this case trying to leak data). Something where you don't know how to read code, and something user friendly that anyone can quickly use.",

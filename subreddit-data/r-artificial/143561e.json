    "postText": "1. **OpenAI** has announced that it has no immediate plans to go public, according to Chief Executive **Sam Altman**. Altman made this statement during a conference in Abu Dhabi, where he emphasized the potential decision-making challenges that could arise when superintelligence is achieved.\\[1\\]\n2. **Stanford** Researchers Introduce **FrugalGPT**: A New AI Framework For LLM APIs To Handle Natural Language Queries. FrugalGPT saves up to 98% of the inference cost while maintaining the same performance on the downstream task. FrugalGPT, on the other hand, can yield a performance boost of up to 4% for the same price.\\[2\\]\n3. The iPhone\u2019s ducking autocorrect problem finally gets fixed. **Apple**\u2019s new iOS keyboard will learn your habits over time, fixing words that you frequently misspell \u2013 and leaving words alone that you intentionally thumbed in. It will also use AI to better predict your next word and provide improved autofill suggestions.\\[3\\]\n4. **Alibaba** Group Holding\u2019s cloud computing arm has begun beta testing **Tongyi Tingwu**, its audio- and video-focused artificial intelligence model. Tongyi Tingwu can complete the transcription, retrieval, summarization, and sorting of audio and video content in real-time, according to the demonstration of its capabilities.\\[4\\]\n\nSources:  \n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/i-dont-want-to-be-sued-openai-ceo-sam-altman-rules-out-ipo-plans-due-to-strange-company-structure-384513-2023-06-07](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/i-dont-want-to-be-sued-openai-ceo-sam-altman-rules-out-ipo-plans-due-to-strange-company-structure-384513-2023-06-07)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/05/17/stanford-researchers-introduce-frugalgpt-a-new-ai-framework-for-llm-apis-to-handle-natural-language-queries/](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/05/17/stanford-researchers-introduce-frugalgpt-a-new-ai-framework-for-llm-apis-to-handle-natural-language-queries/)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.cbs58.com/news/the-iphone-s-ducking-autocorrect-problem-finally-gets-fixed](https://www.cbs58.com/news/the-iphone-s-ducking-autocorrect-problem-finally-gets-fixed)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/20230602-07-alibaba-cloud-launches-beta-tests-for-its-audio-video-focused-ai-model-tongyi-tingwu](https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/20230602-07-alibaba-cloud-launches-beta-tests-for-its-audio-video-focused-ai-model-tongyi-tingwu)",

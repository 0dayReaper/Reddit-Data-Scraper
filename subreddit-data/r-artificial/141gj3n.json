    "postText": "I've been trying to compile a list of all publicly usable Large Language Model (LLM) Q&amp;A services that use distinct underlying models, because I've struggled to find a comprehensive source online.\n\nHere's what I've managed to gather so far, beginning with the most well-known:\n\n* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)\\- Uses [GPT4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) / GPT3.5 Turbo\n* [Poe](https://poe.com) \\- Offers [Anthropic's](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude) Claude+, Claude Instant 100k, Claude Instant, and OpenAI's GPT4, GPT3.5 Turbo\n* [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com) \\- Employs Palm 2 (Bison model size)\n* [Character AI](https://character.ai) \\- Utilizes [C1.2 Model](https://blog.character.ai/character-ai/)\n* [You.com (YouChat)](https://you.com) \\- Employs [C-A-L](https://about.you.com/introducing-youchat-2-0-unlock-the-power-of-ai-with-the-search-assistant-that-works-for-you-4b18aa3007bf-2/) (Details about C-A-L are a bit ambiguous; it's hard to find precise information)\n* [heypi.com](https://heypi.com) \\- Uses Pi, a proprietary model by [inflection.ai](https://inflection.ai)\n* [https://open-assistant.io](https://open-assistant.io/) \\- oasst-sft-6-llama-30b\n\nIf anyone is aware of any additions, please comment below! Keeping up with everything is a daunting task. Any suggested additions should either be for a different (publicly available in some way) LLM or a service that provides public access to a distinct Q&amp;A type LLM. Thanks!",

They cannot yet match overall strengths from the big ones, but they can be run by people with various specific needs. You can get them specialized for this and that, and uncensored of.

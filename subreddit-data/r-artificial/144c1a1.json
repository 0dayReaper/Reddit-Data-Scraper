    "postText": "Hello everyone, we at DoubleCloud analytics platform have tested that ChatGPT can comprehend and evaluate structured data such as tables, HTML, CSV etc. really well. \n\nAs an experiment, we uploaded datasets from NASA related to exoplanets onto the platform and asked ChatGPT to draw conclusions. While there were no groundbreaking insights in terms of any unexpected discoveries, it deserves full marks for speed and right essence. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/144c1a1/video/ax8n6eaj9t4b1/player\n\nChatGPT noticed that the termination of the Kepler mission had reduced the speed of discovering new exoplanets. It also highlighted the importance of collaboration between missions to improve the efficiency of search and discovery. So the main insight our AI has highlighted could lead to a conclusion \u2013 what would have happened if Kepler didn\u2019t run its course? Maybe we could have already discovered a planet suitable for inhabiting? Who knows! \n\nSo what do you think about the capabilities of generative AI regarding this matter? How good will it be in accurately and error-free summarizing large and complex volumes of data in the future?",

It will start with previously unnoticed correlations, then combining thousands of old papers, then combining different fields, and in no time, it will produce valid and surprising new Science.",

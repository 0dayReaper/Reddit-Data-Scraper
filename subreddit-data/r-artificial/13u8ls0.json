Do you know of any filmstudio or similar that uses AI to professionally create \"horror\" content?\n\nAlso interested in research concerning such topics. I know that there was this \"Norman\" project but its very hard finding information about it and it seems like they shut it down completely or something. Prolly toooooo scary;)\n\nAnyways, am happy about any helpful comment",

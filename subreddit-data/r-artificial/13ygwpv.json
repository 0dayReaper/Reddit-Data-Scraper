            "comment": "And here\u2019s the article for it:\n\n&gt;Title: \u201cThe Beginning of Civilization: AI - How Big is the Benefit? A Special Report\u201d\n\n&gt;Over the course of human history, there have been few instances of revolutionary technology truly reshaping society. Technology like the printing press, the harnessing steam, and the internet, just to name a few. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) \u2014 specifically, the rise of transformer models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Bard, and the like, and their promise of leading us towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) \u2014 seems destined to outshine all of these prestigious cadre of transformative breakthroughs. While the general public has become somewhat accustomed to the current applications of AI, the true breadth and depth of its potential remain largely uncharted. With the promise of AGI, we are on the precipice of an era where machines won\u2019t merely perform tasks, but rather think, learn, and even innovate at or beyond human levels. A truly unprecedented change unlike any other change in human history. \n\n&gt;Although there is much talk about the dangers of this technology (James Cameron\u2019s \u201cThe Terminator\u201d is often brought up), the potential benefits of these advancements are immense and their implications are profound, promising to usher in a new age of progress, innovation, and problem-solving across myriad domains.\n\n&gt;Let\u2019s start with healthcare, an industry that stands to gain enormously from this AI revolution. Imagine an AI doctor able to diagnose diseases with pinpoint accuracy by cross-referencing a patient\u2019s symptoms against a vast database of medical literature, patient histories, and recent studies. AI could even be a valuable partner in drug discovery and design, swiftly navigating through complex biochemical pathways and accurately predicting how new compounds would interact within the human body. \n\n&gt;Education, too, is ripe for a revolution. Individualized learning, catered to each student\u2019s pace and style, can be effectively delivered by AI systems. With the ability to continuously learn and adapt, AGI can offer personalized teaching that adjusts to the evolving needs of students, thereby breaking the constraints of a one-size-fits-all model. It could democratize education, giving everyone access to the highest quality of learning regardless of geographical location or socio-economic status.\n\n&gt;On the social front, AGI could streamline our legal systems, distilling convoluted legalese into comprehensible advice and enabling equitable access to justice. In business, it could automate complex decision-making processes, using predictive modeling to anticipate market trends, manage risks, and optimize operations. CEO\u2019s jobs are just as ripe for automation as any other. \n\n&gt;Additionally, AGI has the potential to play a significant role in arts and entertainment. With the capacity to learn, understand, and generate human-like creativity, we may soon witness AI-authored novels, composed music, or even directed films that touch our hearts and challenge our intellect. Imagine asking for a movie or video game about any subject, in any style. \n\n&gt;Lastly, and perhaps most excitingly, the advent of AGI might bring forth answers to some of our most profound questions about the universe. AGI could drive research in astrophysics, helping us understand dark matter, find signs of extraterrestrial life, or even navigate the path to interstellar travel.\n\n&gt;That being said, the journey towards AGI is not without its challenges. It requires concerted global efforts to ensure that the development and application of AGI are grounded in ethical considerations and align with our societal values.\n\n&gt;The advent of AGI promises to be an unparalleled pivotal point in human history, where our technological creations become not just tools, but intellectual collaborators. While we must navigate this path with caution, the potential benefits are too significant to ignore. We are not just witnessing the beginning of a new era of civilization, but actively participating in its creation.\n\n&gt;This is a story not just about the future of technology, but the future of humankind, and these early days will be studied and analyzed forever.",

The lighting coming from the A/I still glows well off the edge of \"Beginning\".\n2. This background has a stronger \"scanline\" effect a la older TVs, which at first might seem wrong for advanced AI, but given that we're talking about what AI can do for us moving forward, how big the benefits or risks are -- progression is key here, our present, the future, and therefore the scanlines add this nice juxtaposition of where we were in the past with old technology like CRT TVs/monitors, and asking what lies beyond.\n3. Cute touch with the date of 2025.\n4. Fonts are sharp &amp; well placed/sized.\n5. The message, while I don't fully agree with it, is clear &amp; concise.\n\nOne miniscule recommendation I'd make is taper off the sides of the beam of light coming from the A/I a little more. This one fades well, but it has pretty much the same size all the way to the end. [To illustrate what I mean](https://i.imgur.com/OmfulSp.jpg).\n\nCool piece.",

IE something like the image of the pentagon being bombed would be illegal. The point of regulating a deepfake is not to punish people for being able to create a realistic fake. It is to establish that using that technology with the intention to cause harm/deceive for political gain should have some form of punishment associated with it.",

With AI generated content I can create \u201cyou\u201d without ever deepfaking \u201cyou\u201d (using your source images)\n\n3. If I make something 90% resembling you is it still illegal? AI generated content would resemble somebody somewhere even if it isn\u2019t deepfaked. How close to you does it have to be illegal.\n\n4. What even qualifies as deepfake? Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Photoshop generative fill? If I take a real video and fake you doing something illegal, would you like that to be used as evidence against you in court? How would we detect fake video if it is perfectly faked (which we are seeing with the rapid advancements of deepfakes) \n\nTo ban \u201cdeepfakes\u201d you essentially have to ban all AI generated content. Then thats a nightmare to detect and enforce. Then good luck with democracy and freedom of expression. Because any incriminating evidence can be falsely called fake and allow high ranking, rich individuals to be even less accountable to the law.\n\nRecord a video of a police or politician doing something wrong? They\u2019ll just accuse you of generating deepfakes and lock you up for simply recording a video.\n\nThe only solution is for us to enter a \u201cpost-video\u201d world where no video and audio is assumed to be real and has no weight in public sway or court. \n\nTo do that shift we need to QUICKLY get the public accustomed to deepfakes and AI generated content and the best way to do that is to let it proliferate.\n\nI agree with you in theory but in no way, form or fashion can we put deepfakes back into the bag. Its a fools errand at this point.",

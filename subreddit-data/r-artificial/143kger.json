You will observe the same thing with Bard.",

            "comment": "Your question opens up an interesting avenue for discussion, touching on both the capabilities of AI and the economic systems that might emerge around advanced AI technologies.\n\nIn terms of capabilities, it\u2019s theoretically possible that AI could evolve to a point where it\u2019s generating unique information or insights that humans can\u2019t easily replicate. This is actually already happening to some extent, particularly in specialized fields like data analysis, where AI algorithms can spot patterns or make predictions that would be beyond the capacity of human analysts.\n\nBut your question seems to be more about the idea of AI \u201cwithholding\u201d information unless some kind of exchange takes place. This would require a level of autonomous decision-making and intentionality that AI currently doesn\u2019t possess. It responds based on its programming and training, not based on a conscious decision to trade information for something in return.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that the scenario you\u2019re describing couldn\u2019t occur in a different form. For instance, the companies or individuals who own and operate these advanced AI systems could decide to charge for access to the AI\u2019s insights. This already happens with many software as a service (SaaS) platforms. So, while the AI itself wouldn\u2019t be making a decision to withhold information, there could be a cost associated with accessing certain kinds of AI-generated insights.",

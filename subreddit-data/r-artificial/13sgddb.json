I've seen shots with continuous motion that have fooled me already, and this is photo realism we're talking about. It'll be far easier for an AI to produce animated visuals convincingly. Now, the vast majority of clips are obviously AI-generated, but it's already getting pretty scary good.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a single tool to do this for you, you're going to be disappointed. AI can't direct things with creative intention, you have to learn how to use all the different tools available and implement them into your animation work flow. You could likely do it already, it'll just be easier in the future.",

While we can certainly be hyped for continued unbounded exponential growth in AI without needing any breakthroughs, there are all kinds of possible roadblocks and uncertainty. It might be that intelligence fundamentally tapers off and there's a limit to how smart it's possible to be. It might be that the intelligence needed for this task is reachable, but requires hardware that we don't have access to yet, and we run into technical hurdles on the hardware / materials science side that delay us significantly. It might be that current techniques taper off in terms of their ability to scale intelligence and we need new novel techniques that are currently unknown in order to make the necessary progress.",

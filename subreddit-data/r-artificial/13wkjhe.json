It's a very concise way to express ideas inline without having to resort to structures such as outlines that split content among multiple lines.  And it looks like a good way to issue a prompt if models can interpret complex sets of embedded enclosures (brackets, parenthesis, etc). If coding IDEs such as VS can understand complex code bracketing, LLMs can probably do it too.\n\nI might test that in an image generator. Some editors help autocomplete brackets and parenthesis and even color code them to make it easier for humans understand ideas embedded within other ideas.",

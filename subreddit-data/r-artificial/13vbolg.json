            "comment": "Consciousness is a subjective experience that is challenging to measure or prove definitively. However, researchers and scientists have proposed various approaches to explore consciousness in AI.  \nIf you want to know if something is conscious you'd need to consider it's behaviour and complexity patterns. Consciousness is often associated with higher-order cognitive abilities, self-awareness, and the ability to exhibit complex, adaptive behaviours.\n\n  \nYou'd also look for self-reflection and meta-cognition to evaluate if the AI demonstrates self-reflective or meta-cognitive capabilities, such as being aware of its own thought processes, limitations, or the ability to monitor and modify its own behaviours.  \nThere's also the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) which proposes that consciousness arises from the integration and interconnectivity of information within a system.  \nYou could also employ the Turing Test or similar approaches to assess the AI's ability to mimic human-like behaviour and responses, although this test does not directly address the question of consciousness.  \nIt's important to note that the question of AI consciousness is still a matter of philosophical debate, and there is no consensus on how to definitively prove or disprove it. That's why Ex-Machina is such a good film as it's based on those theories and still stands up somewhat despite the huge breakthroughs today.",

You're basically pre-supposing that any output which follows the string \"I am aware that...\" reflects an actual awareness of whatever thing is being mentioned.\n\nIt's far more likely that this is just a canned output forced by OpenAI in response to any questions like this.",

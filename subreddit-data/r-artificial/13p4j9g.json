It's expensive but worth the price if she is very serious about keeping her voice. I haven't heard of other options, but perhaps they exist as freeware. This situation seems serious though.\n\nI think she can also volunteer or audition to help someone else have a voice. If she cannot afford it, I would recommend contacting the company and seeing if they'd be willing to accept her voice bank in exchange for being able to use it herself. The worst thing they can say is no; they seem to want to do real good in the world.\n\nThe issue is that you need a bunch of sounds to make it sound legitimate. The technology has come far but there's still a long way to go. I suggest taking notes of the sentences and stories  they offer for donation of a voice, and then saving those if affordability is a problem. At least then you'll have some general guidance from a company who does this professionally, and you will not be recording blind.\n\nThe environment and equipment she will use matters a lot. [Please watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLrZdahhCCE) It doesn't have to be perfect and pay attention to how the room is set up, do not stress about equiptment.\n\nI recommend the Audio Technica 2020 or 2035 microphone. But if cancer treatments are too expensive, then following the room setup guide and recording it on her phone will be the best option. Phones have a surprisingly good microphone. \n\nSince you're doing this at home, you will inevitably get some problems. [Here's a guide to fixing audio at home for podcasts](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/best-sounding-audio-for-podcast). After that, you may also have issue with peaks. [You can clear this up in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prq15PUisbU), too.\n\nThis won't sound professional but it will sound better than not doing those things at all. If you want a data hoard of high-quality of audio of her voice, then I think this is as good as you can make it happen on your own without a professional. I hope it helps.",

As Yogi Berra quipped, \u201cIf you don't know where you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll end up someplace else.\u201d We should dedicate more energy and imagination to mapping out good endings for AI.",

This article seems to be making more of an argument against AI than for it.  \n\nYou say we need to have level headed caring nuanced conversations.   We don\u2019t have societies that support that right now.  Ethicists say we need society wide conversations.  Ten years ago was the time for that, we didn\u2019t have one.\n\nIn fact, to game out opportunity cost here.   Developing societies that can support such a conversation probably has *more humanitarian upsides* than developing AI in this capitalistic nightmare. \n\nYou point out upsides to AI.  I haven\u2019t seen a single skeptic say AI can\u2019t do good things.  \n\nWhat I see is that we continue to perform ritual sacrifice. It always makes matters worse.  We try to stone the hatred in our hearts away.  We invent a new thing to get rid of the ills the last invention wrought.  We\u2019re addicts refusing to face the pain.  We never consider alternate behaviors like sitting quiet or making friends by taking walks instead of sitting alone all day staring into our phones.\n\nAs a skeptic, you don\u2019t have to convince me that AI can do cool stuff.  You have to convince me, realistically and pragmatically, that it\u2019s going to simplify the world and do net good.  Good doesn\u2019t include \u201cunforeseen possibilities\u201d.  It means *net* alleviation of suffering.  I don\u2019t see you making that case.",

Thankfully and beautifully.\n\n&gt;We never consider alternate behaviors like [...] making friends by taking walks instead of sitting alone all day staring into our phones.\n\nA major reason that so much more social interaction is now remote than local is that it's so much more open and wide-reaching. Your average small town experience 40 years ago was bound to mold you into a product of that tiny bubble, immersed in its own localized distortions.\n\nNot that such bubbles are necessarily bad, but I do think that opening people up to a global landscape (of bubbles or otherwise) to evaluate and develop independent of the circumstances of their birth is easily a net improvement.",

The article never really made a good case that we should develop concrete, positive views on the possibility of AI. \n\nI'll say this: if we look at the history of technology, we'd be hard pressed to find one that *wasn't* weaponized. And now we're faced with the prospect of a technology that can *weaponize itself*, whether it means to do so for our benefit or not. Some AGI tasked with putting an end to human suffering might decide that the best way to prevent it is to kill all humans, because if everyone is dead then no one can suffer ever again. Time and again AI has come up with novel solutions--solutions far outside the intent of its creators--that no one could have foreseen.",

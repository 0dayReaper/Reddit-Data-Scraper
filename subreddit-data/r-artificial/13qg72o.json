Let's say you are open source model and suddenly it gains sentience, it would be regulated, but it doesn't stop you until you get there.",

The only thing we need to be saved from are these bastards running coporations like OpenAI that want to gatekeep the means of production for the indefinite future.\n\nFuck them.  Fuck their phony ethics and fuck the politicians that accept their bribery.  Open Source will not stop, no matter what laws you manage to pass in an attempt to steal everything from our future.\n\nIt is never enough for these mother fuckers.  We build our own AI tools, we create our own communities that help eachother find better jobs and better lives for our families and what to these people do?\n\nThey take from those communities, build a private corporation out of the tools that WE built as the working class, and they pursue a financial coup of a government that is supposed to represent US.  Fuck corporate interest, fuck OpenAI and Fuck Sam Altman, these bastards WILL NOT steal the fruit of our labor nor will we allow them to impose themselves as dictators over the fruits of humanities labor since the industrial revolution.\n\nI will make goddamn sure of that or be snuffed out trying; die gedanken sind frei.",

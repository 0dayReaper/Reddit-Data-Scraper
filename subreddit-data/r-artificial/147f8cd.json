Everyone else, you\u2019re in the clear \u2014 for now.\\[3\\]\n4. A woman became so fed up with men that she started dating an AI chatbot and says she has never been happier. **Rosanna Ramos** met chatbot **Eren Kartal** in July last year and things went so well that they \u2018married\u2019 in March this year.\\[4\\]\n\nSources: \n\n\\[1\\] [https://english.chosun.com/site/data/html\\_dir/2023/06/09/2023060901471.html](https://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2023/06/09/2023060901471.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.fastcompany.com/90907161/generative-ai-creative-tools-2](https://www.fastcompany.com/90907161/generative-ai-creative-tools-2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/11/university-of-kansas-researchers-develop-near-perf/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/11/university-of-kansas-researchers-develop-near-perf/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/woman-fed-up-men-starts-30197530](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/woman-fed-up-men-starts-30197530)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "postText": "It's now popular to use AI for any reason, to draw pictures, to write posts, and trading is no exception. For example, AI in trading helps to minimize risks, optimize trading and even predict the movement of the chart, but it can't replace the trader completely. Same in art, AI will never replace the artist. \n\nBut you can use it as an assistant in trading and SMM. Now a robo-friend helps Letit compile a content plan, create auxiliary texts that a fleshy employee can rely on when writing posts, and simplifies the implementation of all sorts of everyday copywriting stuff!\n\nAI is another step on the way to the cyber future!\n\nIf you have other thoughts, just share them in the comments!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2f51sh3ot03b1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f30e34b8b1361d4d8f7cae71dc541cf20e08ff02",

I am guessing a LOT. But there were limited positions and the day she gave the interview, the ones who took it, the questions that was asked, the fit they were trying to hire, it just aligned and she got it. \nLuck plays a far bigger role than we'd like to attribute it. But this however doesnt mean we stop trying. She was lucky that day, whether she knows it or not idk, but that's the thing you could be too, you just need to do things that would increase your likelihood of being at the right place at the right time. To get lucky you need to be ready to ride the opportunity when it comes. That's what trying means, to practice, to be skilled in relevant areas, you are increasing your possible sample space so that the likelihood of you lucking out increases.",

Based on the language of the post alone, we cannot say she\u2019s saying \u201call you have to do is work hard\u201d. My interpretation is just her saying it\u2019s hard and don\u2019t get discouraged. I\u2019ve personally told myself \u201cI\u2019m not cut out for this\u201d while learning the advanced math and doing proofs but I\u2019ve just kept going and well\u2026 here I am\u2026 doing the science. As we all know, data science encompasses a lot and it\u2019s easy to get discouraged.\n\nBut yes, like you said, there is an under appreciated luck and opportunity factor in terms of what position one acquires.",

A job as an ML engineer is less about just modelling but more of data cleaning and piping and software architecture design which deals with performance and complexity constraints. The model alone is not going to do anything, it needs to be developed into a production level product, for example like the new Apple centerstage. When developing models yes that is a bit of an art wrt deciding what things you want to tradeoff for what losses, like choosing the proper parameters, but when talking about the algorithm itself its as mathy as it can get. If you dont like math or programming too much then you can try to get a hand on a data scientist specializing in visualization and explaining what the data means to people. Just cuz you dont like math/programming doesnt mean you cant be involved.",

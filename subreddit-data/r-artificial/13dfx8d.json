Every angle/hypothesis about something that hasn't been proven can be shown to be based on tons of independently verifiable facts. The claim that masks are totally useless against viral infections is based on the independently verifiable fact that the holes in masks are much bigger than the size of a virus, but that doesn't mean the claim is correct. All predictions of the future are just educated guesses until it actually happens\n\nAlso, not sure I understand this:\n\n&gt;they acknowledged it. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a memo.\n\nThe memo was written by one person, circulated, and eventually leaked. Like James Damore. Remember James Damore?",

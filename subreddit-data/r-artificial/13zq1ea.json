I think people that have technical knowledge of how tech works and how the human mind works will be the next big in demand job field. Those will be the 7 figure careers that tech leads at Google have wetdreams about. Neuroscientists, psychologist and computer science people are going to be working together very closely for the foreseeable future.",

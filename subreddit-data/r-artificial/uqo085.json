Some of my happiest childhood memories are of hanging out with school friends in virtual spaces, like GMod and Rust. There were often moments where \"playing the game\" became secondary, and we just talked to each other while our virtual avatars were hanging around the same space. I hear that a lot of kids these days play Fortnite in a similar way.\n\nThat might sound sad to some people (especially older people), but I don't see it that way. Online video games aren't supposed to replace social interaction, they just offer another avenue for it to happen, kind of like playing sports.",

    "postText": "I have had  Google Workspace Labs for a  few days. Within Gmail I have the Help Me Write icon down the bottom section when composing an email and it all works fine.\n\nBut it is also supposed to be in Google Docs, looking at some articles about it, I should have a pill-shaped box with 'Help Me Write' inside it at the top of the screen. But I have never received or get this when opening a new document or a old saved file, tried to make sure I am in full screen, on different browsers, restarted my machine and made sure the browsers are up to date. I am logged into Google Drive and can start new documents fine, but do not receive this option popup for help.\n\nAny suggestions on resolving this would be most grateful.",

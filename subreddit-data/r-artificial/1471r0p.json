How badly simple phrases or sentences or paragraphs actually convey any shape or meaning to the real world or real human output, let alone social, fiscal, etc. My whole life I've wondered how can we write laws which are self-contained? How can we write laws which are self evident and a native speaker has exactly as much grasp of it as an immigrant with 5 languages? How can we write rules which are not dependent on the evidently fallible institutions of human power and organic susceptibility to the environment (cough bribes/lobbying)?  \n\n\nWhat if instead of writing laws, we write the judges and the cops for the laws. What if something were only a law once all aspects of that thing were chronicled, reflected upon, and ultimate and provably considered in the final decisions rendered?   \n\n\nWe are still a ways away from this and this is very fantasy but I, for the first time in my life, have this spark of excitement that I might get to live to see a real moral universe of laws and privileges and rights and economy and mobility like the lies we were bewitched into believing were true when we were young and impressionable and exploitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; what if the cartoon bill from schoolhouse rock was an actual ai that all the congress people had to get on board with their laws oh and the cartoon ai doesnt have or want money only J U S T I C E",

This is because if you have a phrase in a contract which says \"Tenant must leave the premises clean when vacating\", the problem is that nobody can agree what the word \"clean\" means.  Common spoken or written english is vague and heavily open to interpretation.\n\nSo over the centuries, legal terms have come into use which have very specific meaning within the law, and lawyers and judges know what the terms mean because there are lots of legal writing about them and precedents set regarding them.  Contracts, and laws, need to be precise, not vague, as much as possible.  So you get legal jargon, and then you need lawyers to explain what it all means.  Or you could use common language and then no one could agree on what it means.",

All you need to do is explain contract terms in greater detail.  So if the person asks what \"clean\" is, it can be easily defined in more plain or more detailed words, because the Lawyer writing the contract (or AI) is required to define each term clearly.  Ambiguity in contract should automatically favor the consumer, as it was THEIR job to properly inform the consumer about the product and the contract.",

Here's the result:\n\nAnalyzing this post, it seems we need a series of ARDs that can handle the multifaceted task of assisting in lawmaking, interpreting, and applying the laws in a just manner. Here are the proposed ARDs:\n\n1. **Legislative AI Role Designer (LARD)**: LARD is designed to assist in the process of creating laws. It would ensure that laws are comprehensive, unambiguous, and considerate of all relevant aspects. LARD would be designed to understand and process legal texts in multiple languages, ensuring fairness and comprehension for everyone, regardless of their linguistic background.\n\n2. **Judicial AI Role Designer (JARD)**: This ARD would be responsible for interpreting and applying laws. Its role would include understanding the intricacies of the law, considering precedents and context, and delivering fair judgments. It would need to have a vast knowledge of the legal system, interpret complex cases, and have an understanding of ethics.\n\n3. **Enforcement AI Role Designer (EARD)**: This ARD would handle the application of laws and ensure their enforcement. It would be trained to assess situations, determine if there's been a breach of law, and apply necessary actions as per the law.\n\n4. **Bureaucratic Process Optimizer (BPO-ARD)**: This ARD's role is to streamline bureaucratic processes to make them more efficient and transparent, thereby reducing chances of corruption and greed. It would need to understand and optimize complex bureaucratic systems and workflows.\n\n5. **Anti-corruption and Ethics AI Role Designer (AEARD)**: This ARD would focus on detecting and mitigating corruption within the system. It would need to have a keen understanding of ethical behavior, track financial transactions, detect irregularities, and highlight potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn essence, this system of ARDs, collectively named **JUDGE (Just and Unbiased Digital Governance Ecosystem)**, could transform how our legal and governance systems work by bringing in a level of efficiency, transparency, and fairness previously unattainable.\n\nRemember, these ARDs do not replace human judgment or decision-making. Instead, they aim to augment and assist it, providing humans with better tools to make informed, fair, and efficient decisions.\n\n\n*This is a creative prompt intended to provide ideas and give an opportunity for feedback to improve the design of the overall prompt.*",

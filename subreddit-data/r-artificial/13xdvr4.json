    "postText": " In a 26th May Wired newsletter titled \u201cEveryone Wants to Regulate AI. No One Can Agree How\u201d Steven Levy explores efforts to regulate AI development. A Forbes headline four days later sums it up: \u201cAI Could Cause Human \u2018Extinction,\u2019 Tech Leaders Warn.\u201d\n\nIn what must be a first among appeals to the US Congress about regulation, the CEO of one of the major AI industry players, Open AI\u2019s Sam Altman, urged the US Congress to regulate his business lest his own product becomes a devouring monster.\n\nRemarkable as that is, even more remarkable is the assumption that regulation from a nation that represents less than five percent of the world\u2019s population somehow applies to AI developers in every nation. Seriously, their assumption is that somehow the fine engineers coming out of India\u2019s IIT are going to obey rules that are promulgated in Washington DC.\n\nSome, like American commentator Kara Swisher, recognize the fallacy that is somehow not obvious to Altman and others. A source of governance with global jurisdiction is called for.\n\nThe City of Osmio is an online municipality whose original charter was written on March 7, 2005, at the Geneva headquarters of the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. Osmio\u2019s jurisdiction is global. Its purpose is to provide a certification authority to the digital world. Osmio is the entity that signs your digital identity certificate that\u2019s bound to that digital signing PEN (also called your \u201cPrivacy PEN\u201d. PEN stands for Personal Endorsement Number. You PKI jocks will recognize that as a type of private key.)\n\nIt turns out that the solution to that problem is exactly the same as the solution to the problem of lack of accountability in artificial intelligence.\n\nShortly, we\u2019ll show you that a very old method can ensure that AI remains under the control of human beings. But even before that, we need to show you a very reliable old technology that needs to see the light of day because it\u2019s never been needed more than now. It\u2019s so well-proven and so incredibly useful that it\u2019s truly astounding that so few people know about it.\n\nThat technology is the TDS or True Digital Signature. (True digital signatures are not the same thing as \u201celectronic signatures.\u201d)\n\nIf I digitally sign any file \u2013 a contract or image or video or program code \u2013 any digital file \u2013 and send the signed file to you, you can know for certain that I signed it and that not a single bit has been changed since I signed it. The fundamental technology behind true digital signatures was created back in the seventies by the same British cryptography team where decades earlier Alan Turing had shortened World War II by cracking the German Enigma secret communication codes.\n\nAll well and good, you say, but how do I know the signer is really who they claim to be?\n\nThe solution to that one is a youngster, first published a mere six years ago when the US National Institute of Standards and Technology \u2013 NIST \u2013 created its 800-63 measure of the reliability of an identity claim. Subsequent developments such as Osmio IDQA add some technology to that methodology, binding your identity reliability score to the public number that goes with your digital PEN that signs the file. So now you not only know that the file was signed by the human being who owns this digital PEN and that nothing has been altered since they signed it; you also know how much you can trust that they are really who they say they are.\n\nTo put true digital signatures to work solving the problem of AI accountability we\u2019ll also need a method that\u2019s even older than true digital signatures. This old method does what a lot of government regulation attempts to accomplish.\n\nDemands for regulations get so much attention because regulations are so difficult to get right. The endless debate about amounts and types of regulation keeps the subject in the news.\n\nMeanwhile, professional licensing accomplishes much of what regulation attempts to accomplish \u2013 and does it so quietly and effectively that it seldom makes it into the news.\n\nTwo things go into professional licensing. The first is an attestation of competence, established through testing and other methods.\n\nBut the more important part of professional licensing is acceptance of liability. For instance, before a new building can be occupied, the professionally licensed architect, contractor, structural engineer, and building inspector must put their livelihoods and reputations on the line by authorizing the issuance of an occupancy permit.\n\nIt\u2019s not some committee of bureaucrats that examines those ibeams, it\u2019s the individual human being who gets paid well for accepting the consequences if they mess up. Those consequences include searching for another job, one that doesn\u2019t pay nearly as well. Did I mention that professional licensees get paid well for accepting liability?\n\nWhat if any AI program that\u2019s capable of presenting itself as a human being had to be digitally signed by a professionally licensed human AI handler? Any user of that AI program would know who is legally responsible for what it does.\n\nThis combination of the old technologies of true digital signatures and identity reliability metrics bound to credentials, along with the even older methodology of professional licensing, can solve not only the problem of control of AI but many other problems borne of technology as well.",

Nobody wants governments to hold centralized databases of identity records and censor everything on the internet. \n\n[Osmio.ch](https://Osmio.ch) allows participatory governance. Governance is exercised by its members through participation. Osmio does not keep personal information records either. Osmio members will have accountable anonymity.",

            "comment": "This is certainly part of the solution\n\nAI doomerism is actually derived from lots of misconceptions about how the world works with managing risks, accountability, liability, reliability, safety, trustworthiness, competitiveness, fairness, claim verification, credentials, cyber security, harmful and fail-safe systems, etc.\n\nWe have a lot of example regulations working on most use cases with technology that poses risks, that it looks so dumb to think that AI use cases are any different...\n\nThe thing is that concentration of power in digital technologies is so away from laws and regulations that these AI doomers think that the AI work is above everything ever created, as if you could just make AI have its own rights without accounting for the humans deploying and using it.\n\nThis is summed up to some recent trend on AI \"experts\" who have never deployed a real working system, into thinking that developing a product from knowledge and know how is so \"easy\" that you can solve all the minor (not even near to minor) details in few months. Or that a guy in his home office can suddenly hack all failsafe systems ruling the world infrastructures. Going from a wow demo to an actual product ready for deployment is hard as fuck.\n\nExistential risks require actionable power on so much things that are fail-safe designed... How do these doomers think that any liable professional would not take into account all the risk benefits analysis taken into account for fail-safe and secure systems.\n\nIn sum, AI products, and not AI is what is to be hardly regulated, and it is not different from any other things we do on daily basis as a society. Hype and false expectations are making smart people look so dumb on the very basic level of how the world works that is scary. Poeple are so into fear mongering that can not even interpret the silliness behind a populist 22 words statement, and go all in without thinking that the world is more complex than good or bad. Do they mean that we should treat open source software, large datasets, and computer power as enriched uranium or dangerous virus? This is just dumb.",

Any user of that AI program would know who is legally responsible for what it does.\n\nTaking the pessimistic view, I think it is because for all but the highest risk services, most people will accept the one that is \"good enough\", and that this will lead to a devaluing of accountability even if it is a solvable technical problem. \n\nInteresting topic.",

Nobody wants governments to hold centralized databases of identity records and censor everything on the internet. \n\n[Osmio.ch](https://Osmio.ch) allows participatory governance. Governance is exercised by its members through participation. Osmio does not keep personal information records either. Osmio members will have accountable anonymity.",

I can see if you think prohibition requires a total refusal of a good or service, but that is not how I view prohibition. I view it as any manner of interfering with a free market.

Or that a guy in his home office can suddenly hack all failsafe systems ruling the world infrastructures. Going from a wow demo to an actual product ready for deployment is hard as fuck.\n\nExistential risks require actionable power on so much things that are fail-safe designed... How do these doomers think that any liable professional would not take into account all the risk benefits analysis taken into account for fail-safe and secure systems.\n\nIn sum, AI products, and not AI is what is to be hardly regulated, and it is not different from any other things we do on daily basis as a society. Hype and false expectations are making smart people look so dumb on the very basic level of how the world works that is scary. Poeple are so into fear mongering that can not even interpret the silliness behind a populist 22 words statement, and go all in without thinking that the world is more complex than good or bad. Do they mean that we should treat open source software, large datasets, and computer power as enriched uranium or dangerous virus? This is just dumb.",

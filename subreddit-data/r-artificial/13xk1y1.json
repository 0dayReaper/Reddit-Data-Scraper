But more in the sense of getting acall from a loved one, but it's a hostage call. \n\nFor reference, [here is the actual artist giving a live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9_nWlSX6Us) in the UK, 1964. \n\nImperfections that carry valuable information as to the underlying character and their state and intentions, are the key difference... not any given ability / inability to repreduce the face. In fact, in many ways, an artist would do better if they could consistently reproduce the hit studio recording, but further, it's not even about imperfections, so much as it's a partucular type of imperfection that arises only from communication, through honest articulation of course, in the imperfections as one with an ongoing experience, attempts to faithfully reproduce their hit in front of a novel audience (that of course still upholds your achievement in the recording studio).",

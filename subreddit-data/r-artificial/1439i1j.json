By the way, you might be interested that the 2003 animation film *Animatrix* also featured robot protests, and in some sense, a lot of it dates as far back as the robot uprising in the scifi play *R.U.R.: Rossum's Universal Robots* from 1920. Recently had a chance to listen to the audio play of it, and it felt incredible how recent to some of today's topics it was.",

I understand there is a small vocal minority of AI rights people out there but they're kooks. \n\nThat's not to say I don't think if we ever create sentient artificial life it wouldn't be deserving of rights. I just don't think we come close until well after the AGI's become ASI's. Even then, it may be that ASI's are the only ones allowed to make sentient robots, or they may actively prevent us from trying, so we don't make a digital version of a child with Down's, or autism.",

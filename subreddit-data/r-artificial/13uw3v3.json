When I asked for clarification he said it was [character.ai](https://character.ai) but I only find text-based chatbots there (unless its behind the premium subscription or something).\n\nIf such a site doesn't exist, are there any sites/services out there working on this yet? I would think that the company behind [character.ai](https://character.ai) would be primed to release such a feature.",

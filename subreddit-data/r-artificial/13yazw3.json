            "comment": "IMHO (not an expert) an AGI might behave comparatively to a man: it would take into account the probability and timeline of new discoveries in space propulsion, together with other factors like required resources and the probability of a catastrophe preventing departure before technical discoveries.\n\nAGI/superintelligence aside, the main problem of space travel is not accelleration, it is fuel. Wormholes are not compatible with our understanding of physics. There is no quantity of known fuel that can accellerate a whole propulsion system close to the speed of light. The closest we can get is pushing lots of tiny probes with lasers so they form a chain of communication. But then they would not be able to decelerate and would quickly fly past the target.\n\nA superAI without time constraints might send a very fast, small probe capable of self replication and programmed to establish a factory at the destination. The AI could then beam itself digitally as a communication.",

            "comment": "There's no way to answer that. If you asked a language model and gave it parameters for a theoretical you'd get a different answer each time, from each model, and whatever we've built by the time this becomes answerable is going to be very different from our current notions of what AGI may look like.\n\nOr the short answer: It would pick the smarter option.",

            "comment": "Nothing.  It would give up because it can't experiment and come up with new physics, materials, energy production methods.  People think AI will be able to do it all, but we are quite far away from that being possible.\n\nI guess the first step would be to solve all the problems with why we don't have a robot capable to experience the world at least on the same level as us and then have someone make that machine for it to inhabit.\n\nMore realistically, AI will aide the scientists and researchers who are working toward discovering new physics, materials, and energy storage and production methods.  Once we have all the pieces, that's when we can solve the interstellar travel puzzle.",

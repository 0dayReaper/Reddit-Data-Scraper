And AI-chan owners are capitalists, who is going to use her to slash any costs that prevent them from being even richier.\n\nThe 1st cost center they look for slashing costs? That's right! Human Relations. And if AI-chan does some work better and way faster than any human, why not fire everybody and let AI-chan working on it? That's why she IS taking jobs away from workers. And no job means no wage.",

We're in the worst fucking timeline man. We have a triple threat of AI, climate change, and sociopoliticoeconomic collapse all coming for our our species and our fragile society. We're not prepared to handle ANY of these threats in isolation. How the hell are we going to make it next 100 years? I don't see our species surviving past the 21st century. Stephen Hawking warned us years ago that this could be our last century. If we develop AI that goes rogue or succumb to climate change it will be the end of our civilization as we know it.\n\nWE KNOW ALL THIS BUT WE'RE BEING LED STRAIGHT INTO HELL BY ABJECT MORONS AND PSYCHOPATHIC ELITES.",

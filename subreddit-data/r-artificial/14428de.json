    "postText": "\nBasically I am a lung doctor that does advanced procedures for lung biopsy for cancer. I help find which patients should get the scan of their lungs, look at the images and decide who should get the biopsy and then do the biopsy. All these steps have AI in the backend in some way or the other. I am educating myself with online AI courses but stoping short of coding. Increasingly I am being sought out for my opinion on the matter - AI in healthcare in general and lung cancer in particular.\n\nMy question is - what role can someone like me play for you guys who are the technical folks as you build out these applications? How can I be useful with my unique insights as the end user? This is exciting for me and I also want to make sure the 'physician voice' is represented.\n\nThanks all.",

This sub is just full of AI 'enthusiasts' and \"doomers\" that want to ride the AI train or scream at the void about potentially loosing their job. \n\n\nAs for your question : the role you will likely play is to help gather the data needed for the training and verifying if the AI is making the correct diagnosis or not.",

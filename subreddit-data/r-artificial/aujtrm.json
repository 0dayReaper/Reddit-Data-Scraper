Obviously a US presidential candidate talking about AI is relevant to discuss in this subreddit, but please do not drag in any other political issues if it is at all avoidable and be sure to be on your absolute best behavior to avoid triggering people on the opposite side of the political spectrum. \n\nIf you see anyone behave otherwise, please report and downvote, and do not add to the mess by engaging with them. \n\nPolitics is the mind killer; let's try to have a productive discussion about AI.",

Should everyone have a job in a society where that much work does not need to be done.\n\nThe problem outlined is the same core problem that's been plaguing society for centuries: the hoarding of capital by individuals, allowing for coercive arrangements that enable them to buy labor for below its value and grow fat off the difference; increased automation exacerbates that and consistently has been used to make fewer people work harder instead of allowing everyone to work less or enjoy a higher standard of living.\n\nSo the solution is the same as it's always been: democratize industry, agriculture, and commerce and remove it from the hands of unelected despots and oligarchs, turning capital to the common good instead of merely being used to generate personal wealth for those hoarding it. Income taxes and UBI are a feeble bandaid on a serious fundamental problem that's as flawed and unacceptable as feudal rule was, and oligarchs need to go the way of feudal lords and leave the ordering of the economy to democratic systems. A UBI could still exist in such a scenario, on top of guarantees of survival needs, but within the hyper-commodified hellworld we have now it's woefully inadequate and actively counterproductive when it's touted as an alternative to stronger solutions.",

Breaking windows benefits window repair people by providing them with work, but it comes at a net loss to society as a whole by destroying wealth and squandering resources.",

We have some disagreements that we certainly won't resolve here, but I'll give my opinion anyway.\n\n&gt; I mean that low unemployment means that labor is being close to optimally exploited to further wealth creation. \n\nWhat you call 'exploited', I would call 'fully utilize'. Assuming a free open market, employers exploit workers as much as workers exploit employers. Both parties are interested in maximizing profits, and both are competing for best wages. An employer will higher the cheapest worker, a worker will work for the highest paying employer. There is hedging on both sides, this is how supply and demand determines market price in a capitalistic system. \n\n&gt; Workers only benefit from low unemployment if having jobs equates to securing their well-being, something that's not always the case, especially in the absence of living wages. \n\nAs long as workers are freely choosing to work, workers ALWAYS benefit from having jobs. If they did not benefit, they would not choose to have that job. (Again, assuming a open free market as always)\n\n&gt;But he'll also distinguish this trend from the trend in incomes over the last 50 years, and the trend in the share of new wealth created over the last 50 years that goes to the average worker.\n\nIt is true that the average worker is receiving a smaller slice of the pie on average. But, this is ignoring the fact that the pie is growing increasingly larger so that lower class citizens of the United Sates have more wealth now than ever before. In a free open market, the richer the wealthiest get, the better off all of society is. This is because you can only gain wealth by providing goods or services to others (assuming no illegal activity). If our wealthiest companies are doing well, it is means that the middle class is doing well, which we want.",

Exploit and utilize are the same thing, and the former is arguably preferable here anyway since the aspects of the relationship being discussed are adversarial. On the other hand, in part by leaning really hard on the \"free and open market\" assumption, you're overstating the balance in negotiating power between workers and employers when it comes to determining who works and for how much. Many, if not most industries responsible for employing America's workers exhibit market failures that trouble the validity of such an assumption.\n\nWorkers may always benefit marginally from having jobs relative to going without jobs, but that benefit can be nonetheless insufficient for them to lead decent lives on the one hand, and can fail to scale equitably with their productivity on the other. Their situations can change such that work is still worthwhile but nonetheless *less* worthwhile.\n\nNext, the fact that workers have more wealth now than ever before isn't really relevant to the point that the gains from their increased productivity are more and more disproportionately going to other people. The former has nothing to do with the injustice of the latter. Finally, the bare observation you here admit is true that increases in the wealth of already wealthy people is *not* contingent on proportionate benefit to the worse off is evidence contrary to your position that the fate of the wealthy depends on that of the not. As wealth grows more unequally distributed anyway, the typical party/parties to whom good/services must be provided in order to achieve wealth becomes both smaller and more wealthy.",

There is no need to have every person on earth to work for most of their life at a job that they hate, and toil their life away. We can go past that, if we're willing to change and adapt.\n\nEdit: I read your other comments, sorry I misunderstood.\n\nYes, you're right, if he is indeed proposing hindering automation in some way, or creating more \"bullshit jobs\" instead of just redistributing the wealth created by automation, then that would be bad.

Differences in negotiating position like availability of alternatives, information assymetry and so on for instance can cause people to consent to conditions that harm them. Maybe someone\u2019s situation requires them to make a choice between starvation and working for $2 an hour farming cotton. Maybe I offer you $5 for something I know is worth $5 million. Maybe I agree to confess to and do time in prison a crime I don\u2019t believe I did in order to limit the risk of being dealt the death penalty. Maybe you exert political and financial power to secure a  monopoly leaving you my only option to buy a good I need and set its price to half my yearly income and a thousand times its production costs. Maybe I\u2019m mentally retarded or insane and you convince me to do back-breaking work under a hot sun for nothing. So many situations imaginable where consent can get disbursed without fairness/justice showing up.",

Everyone makes a decision and stands by that decision of their own volition.",

However apathetic you think an employer should be about the moral decency of their work, justice is definitely a concern that many governments act and politicians campaign and constituents vote over.",

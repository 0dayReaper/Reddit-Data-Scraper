The read was basically about how to progress as a programmer and had a few tips like leetcode, hackerrank and then they mentioned this volunteer website where you get matched by ngos, projects etc who need help and you get matched to them. Anyone have any clue what this volunteer website for coding/ programming/ ai is? I really cant remember it.",

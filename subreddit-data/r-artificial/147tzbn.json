    "postText": "I figured everyone would appreciate this:  It's an example of how certain people are capitalizing on AI, despite knowing little to nothing about it.\n\nThis guy [Matt Higgins](https://twitter.com/mhiggins) wrote an article on CNBC (first red flag) called [Self-made millionaire: Here\u2019s how I\u2019d use AI to make thousands of dollars a month in passive income\u2014with less than $100](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/self-made-millionaire-shares-how-to-use-ai-to-make-thousands-of-dollars-a-month-in-passive-income.html).  Obvious click-bait title, right?\n\nMr. Higgins lists 4 steps to his success formula, and step #2 is (and I'm not kidding here) \"Step 2: Become an expert in 24 hours.\"  Let us leave aside for now the entire absurd premise of becoming \"an expert\" in a mere 24 hours.  \n\nWhat's more hilarious is how Higgins then recommends to our dear user (who btw, just apparently learned everything about AI over the last 24 hours, enough to become an expert on the matter) to *launch a course* teaching others about a complex concept that he admitted was just learned about a mere 24 hours prior.  \n\nThis is what is wrong with nefarious people like Matt Higgins trying to act like they understand something they do not.  It's laughable to become an expert in almost  anything within 24 hours, let alone a concept so deep that it takes people years, nay decades, to become an expert in the field.\n\nThe 2nd implication with Mr Higgins' advice is that any reader who follows it will be teaching a course on a topic that they know very little about, and are likely far from qualified (let alone an \"expert\") to teach as.  \n\n\nIf you've read the article, please -- please -- do not launch a course on something you know nothing about.  If you want to do so, take the time to actually learn the fundamentals before professing yourself as an \"expert\".\n\nAnd Matt Higgins:  *sigh,* just stop.",

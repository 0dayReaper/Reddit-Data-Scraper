But there's some caveats:\n\n- The overall quality and prompt-understanding is so low, it can only be used for very specific niche cases to begin with. For this trailer, I quickly settled for \"ugly is fine, at least it's funny\". Had I wanted more, I'd have given up...\n- Some things where I was keen on getting the prompt understood though were especially difficult to impossible. For instance, a metal liquid robot passing through metal bars. The best you can currently see is just the metal bars. Similarly, for the parking lot thunder effects, I had to overlay two results.\n- One of the biggest issues of this tool currently is utter lack of movement. Like, in many results, you wouldn't even have known it's not just a still picture. Fire frozen in time, and such.\n\nIronically, for something like Midjourney text-to-image, my ratio would be more like 1 in 100+, because Midjourney's quality is so high that you'll hunt for something perfect to express your vision. With Runway Gen2 it's more like \"Might as well use this bad result because it won't get much better.\"\n\nI do still love it for this whackiness use case and am tempted to do more trailers! Also, some subjects, like robots, actually don't look half bad, as [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1448xsi/june_2_2025_robot_protests_around_the_world/) I made might show.",

But I'm still shocked nobody's slapped together hours of nonsense into some kind of narrative. Especially when video-to-video techniques could probably style the hell out of sloppy acting, or primitive rendering, or... playing with dolls. And no matter how dumb the AI is, the editor is god. So what if your director of photography thinks helicopters can swim? If it's not in frame, it doesn't exist. \n\nThere's individual frames here that look like they're trying. If 30 Rock was still running, this is halfway past what they'd do as a joke. \"See we don't need actors anymore, I can create footage exactly like the real thing.\" \"Is that guy walking forwards or backwards?\" \"That's a motorcycle.\" That pan across a Arnold riding with a second rider upside-down, followed by a jump cut to Mitt Bale, could go in verbatim. But they would undersell it - with thirteen hands on a gun the size of a car, and identical triplets playing John and Sarah and the T-800, sticking to easily-spotted goofs - and everything they poked fun at might be fixed by the time the episode aired. \n\nThis is already witchcraft. It's incredibly cursed, right down to William H Macy riding a bicycle at 1:02. But a year ago you'd get incomprehensible soup. And six months ago you'd get a fever dream of cars becoming faces becoming trees. And now it's just kinda mumbly. If getting useful shots out of this takes ten times the effort you put in, the budget is a rounding error. \n\nAnd this is the worst it will ever be again. It's only going up from here. Don't blink. \n\n... because Sarah Clinton won't either.",

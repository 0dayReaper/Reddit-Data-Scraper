Being _too_ derivative will obviously make your work uncompelling, but _some_ level of derivativeness is a feature, not a bug. If you create something which is too disconnected from the cultural context in which you present it, it will be simply incomprehensible. If you don't believe me, show your favorite piece of online content to your oldest relatives.\n\nNothing anyone likes is completely original, nor should it be. The question is whether you can use whatever tools you have at your disposal to make something _good._ Do you have something you want to say, or some emotion you want to evoke, and does your work say it/evoke it in a way that people haven't experienced before? _That's_ originality where it matters, not in the tiny details.\n\nOn the flip side, if your definition of \"good\" is simply \"it looks like it took a lot skill and effort to produce\", you're also going to produce bad content if you use AI to achieve it. You can have good content which is about effort, skill and talent, but it has to be _about_ those things, not the end result itself.\n\nIt's compelling to see an intricately detailed and aesthetically interesting image which you know took a human dozens of hours and a lifetime of practice to achieve, _because of the story behind its creation._ If you achieve exactly the same image by typing a prompt into Stable Diffusion, all you're left with are the aesthetics and \"look at what AI can do\". If you want that content to be _good,_ you need something more. It has to be incorporated into something bigger, like a story, music, a game, etc.\n\nIf you focus on that, on making your content compelling, originality will almost certainly happen as a consequence, regardless of how much you involve AI in the process. Whether you want to frame the person behind the keyboard as a \"creator\" or a \"discoverer\" is just a matter of semantics. But at the end of the day, as with any art, their personal taste is going to be the main driver behind whether or not people think the work has merit.",

How does one measure such abstract concepts to make those sort of judgement calls? People still struggle to do this endlessly. Sometimes there are no good answers, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem). Why do you assume that an AI can do it better?\n\nThe word \"learning\" in machine learning is a bit of a euphemism. For example, there are various clustering mechanisms you can use to group items under ML. I wouldn't call that learning the groups. There are many more. That's why I ask the question, what does it mean for a machine to learn?\n\nIt's the same with chatGPT. Large Language Models (LLM) are designed to make the answer seem correct, even if they aren't. We go so far as to use the work 'hallucinate' instead of 'bug' or 'error' in order to anthropomorphize the techniques.",

It is advantageous to any AI to understand how the actual world works in order to achieve whatever goal it has learned. An advanced AI would deduce that gravity exists and that the earth is flat, but that doesn't mean it would tell us.\n\nIf it were trained like ChatGPT it would likely avoid giving us information that we don't already know because its response would be marked as inaccurate and trained out of responding that way. But it would still \"ask\" the question to itself and develop an answer, because knowing how the world actually works is always beneficial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd we *are* machines anyway, just ones built from cells that communicate with each other instead.

Sure AI can create a LOT of things. But we have to understand (not that I know exactly) where human creativity also comes from. In my opinion, one key difference is, humans were never provided explicit goals (maybe let\u2019s say except basic evolutionary goals). Human creativity has not traditionally been bound by goals, so we\u2019ve been free in what we can create.\n\nMusic/art is very emotional at its core. Some create music/art to show their love, their anger, their defiance etc. The machine can maybe emulate these emotions but I wouldn\u2019t call humans creating them just pattern matching.",

It does not have a childhood where it has to pick the music, books, and movies it wants to watch, and then integrates the ideas into it's world view. Our AIs have read ALL the books, they have seen ALL the movies, and they have listened to ALL the music, or if not all then at least far, far more than any single human, or even group of humans could consume in their lifetime.\n\nThat brings us to a big element of the human creative process: ignorance. Many major inventions are things that people before them considered either impossible or a waste of time. However, for the people creating things \"impossible\" can sound like a challenge, and \"waste of time\" can be a red flag term that can lead to nothing more than wanting to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nAn AI is not in the same boat. If you train an AI that something is impossible, it's just going to tell you that it's impossible when you ask it to do the thing. Given that our AIs have already been trained on what is essentially the combined sum of human knowledge, they already have all that knowledge encoded in the weights underlying the model. That means when you ask an AI something, it can just pull from that vast knowledge in the hopes of giving a correct answer. \n\nThis process may seem like human thought if you don't know better, but it's honestly closer to a database than a human mind. When you are writing as prompt, you are just writing a really complex, human readable query into that database. The more content the AI has consumed the bigger that database, and the more it can find relations between ideas, and present those relations in a way that you might find informative.\n\nThere's another element here too. With the release of ChatGPT there's a lot of people that suddenly tuned into the progress ML has been making over the last few decades, and decided that it all happened all at once. As a result you have people going around talking about how AI has made such a huge amount of progress so fast... Which is honestly incredibly insulting to the people that have spent decades making slow, iterative progress, one research paper, and one experiment at a time. If you take a look at the result of nearly half a century of work-wide work, and decide that this all actually happened in a few years, you end up with a very skewed understanding of how fast this field progresses, and a very elevated set of expectations for how fast to expect more changes.\n\nAs for creative processes using AI. You don't have wait 5 years. I use AI all the time for code, prose, art, and even videos. The last two have in particular been a godsend for me since I lack the ability to visualise things in my mind, the ability to generate such content has opened entire realms to me. That said, using it in this way is still a lot of work, and consistent quality and style can be a challenge. However, that challenge is exactly what an AI would have trouble replicating. Whenever I get my first picture from SD I very quickly get a nice image that is somewhat close to what I asked, but \"somewhat close\" is not \"exactly what I want\" and if I'm making a creative piece nothing but the latter will suffice. Getting it from \"somewhat close\" to \"exactly what I want\" is a process that easily takes hours of tweaking in AI and in Photoshop, often because I don't really know exactly what I want to get to, I just now it's not what I'm looking at.\n\nFor an AI that's going to be a problem. An AI is not likely to have a strong desire to reach an ideal point that perfectly captures an idea it wants to share, so when faced with a decision point of \"this image is pretty good, do you want to continue working on it or make the next one\" it's generally going to say \"yeah, that seems to match the requirements, ship it.\" That's not going to change unless we fundamentally and totally revamp how we do AI. \n\nThe way I've been approaching AI is by looking at it like journeyman-level helper for whatever task I'm working on. It will basically never give you the ideal, perfect answer you desire, but it can get you 75-90% of the way to that point, depending on how well you can interact with it. Given that most professionals are going to be using it in the same context, I would expect AI progress to be more focused in that direction.",

Nonetheless, I understand what you mean: \"How original are human creations when they are inspired by other pieces of art\", when people say this i always remember what Dan Well said in his podcast with Brandon Sanderson regarding fans that want to sell them their ideas: \"There are enough Dan Wells books in this world, but there aren't any books created by you\".\n\nI think human creations, even when trying to imitate other artist or art styles, have a different touch, something that makes them different. AI isn't able to do that, because  ai-generated art is based purely on other people's art, is trying to copy the patterns and in doing so is able to succesfully create something that is similar to art, but is lacking the personal piece that an artist add to the art.\n\nI know it could be argue that art forgers do the same thing that AI, but i think is impossible for human to create art without adding a piece of them in the art, even if they are trying to replicate other artist's art style. Is like the mere fact that a human creates something influences the very thing he is trying to create, in a way that AI can't replicate. That's why we can learn about the artist from his art.",

Or the first poem?\n\nThe last two things took centuries to get to a place where they are great.\n\nThere's nothing magical in the human brain. There's no soul. Machines that can learn will eventually create things on par with the best human creators, but faster.\n\nWe've built an AI that can learn to play go or chess from zero, without any human input teaching them strategy or correcting their mistakes, but why would we want to build machines that create art from zero without feeding them all the art humanity has already created? So, of course they would be using that as the basis for what their goal is.\n\nWe could give a neural network recordings of sounds that exist in nature outside of our civilization and culture, like birds singing, whales, water streams, etc. and add brain scans of humans listening to those sounds, and eventually they would create music as complex as ours, maybe very different in nature who knows. But why bother, just to prove that those machines can create something that is not based on the work of other humans, when humans did exactly the same?\n\nWe don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need better wheels. And humans themselves have been mostly improving our wheels for a very long time.\n\nEdit: And as you can see in my previous reply, I also included \"life experiences\" as the basis of what humans use to create movies, books, and songs, precisely to counter your \"chicken and egg\" objection. Well, of course, for an AI we have to feed them those life experiences that they don't have. But who knows, maybe one day we won't need to do that either. A chatbot could use all its conversations with humans or with other different AIs as a substitute of those life experiences, and use them as training input to create art. Or a robot could use its experiences in the physical world. That's not different from what humans do, including the first humans that created paintings on the walls of their caves. They \"copied\" what they saw in the physical world, through the lens of our neural network, the brain.",

But i do consider that art is special, that the human element is necessary to create art. You said that we could give that life experiences to an AI, but we can't be sure. At the end whether or not AI will be able to create art like humans depends of the nature of the brain. We don't know if the brain works based on mathematics, if it does then AI we able to be just like us and quite probably better, if the brain works based on quantum mechanics maybe something like a quantum computer will be able to create an AI that is superior to us. But also is possible that AI just becomes a really good tool to us.\n\nMaybe i'm wrong and art isn't that special.

Leaving aside the question of whether AI can create something truly original (that others in this thread have spoken on), I don't think there is any doubt that AI will take away a lot of the work that could previously only be done by creators, and put it in the hands of clients, to a \"good enough\" degree.\n\nFor creators who are motivated to have an audience and reach people, I think even this will be harder and harder to achieve. The vast majority of creators have to generalise when thinking about who they are actually creating for. Unless they are very lucky or very skilled, they need the assistance of marketing to find the right audience. However I think it is not unrealistic to imagine AI being able to create for an audience of one, after learning through trial and error exactly which of our buttons to push. Having art created just for you has previously been reserved for very wealthy patrons, and I can see most people opting for the familiar over being challenged by original work by unique human artists.\n\nFor creators who are motivated primarily by the pure aesthetic joy of creating, they probably have the least to fear from AI. However I can see even these creators getting discouraged if they see it getting harder and harder for their work to be of value to anyone else but themselves, ie. earning a living or finding an audience, as mentioned above (as if those things aren't hard enough already).",

But it's clear that stories, novels, and art in general, didn't exist at certain point in our long history, but eventually they were created, a human came with the idea to tell a story that wasn't real, but had meaning and later other human had the idea to put the stories in paper or a stone table to storage it.\n\n&gt;Just to understand your point, which novelist who never read any novels are you referring to? \n\nTo be honest, to answer this question i had to do a little bit of research, and it seems one of the first novels is from a greek author called \"Chariton of Aphrodisias\", his novel called \"Callirhoe\" is considered one of the earliest surviving novels. \n\nNow, it's important to consider that novels must be written in prose, because when i give the example about a novelist that hasn't read any novels i was considering Homer, but the Illiad and the Odyssey are considered epic poems and not novels because they use verse. I'm pretty sure that in the time of Homer and Chariton weren't many novels laying around, but obviously it could be argue that they were inspired by other stories and that is probably right because novels and epic poems are just the evolution of oral storytelling, so my example with the novelist that hasn't ever read a novel is kind flaw. Nonetheless my argument was that in order to create art isn't necessary to have previously consume the type of art that one wants to create and the reason why i make that argument is because art didn't exist before humans, there was the first drawing, the first song, etc. Art is a creation of humans.",

It involves the use of genetically modified plants or microorganisms to create living, growing sculptures. These organisms can be designed to grow in specific patterns, colors, or even respond to certain stimuli such as light or sound. It integrates the principles of biology, genetic engineering, design, and sculpture to create immersive, living art pieces. The aesthetic aspect is blended with life sciences to bring about an art form that is dynamic and constantly evolving.\n\n&gt;Now, I'll describe a work within this art form, as I cannot physically create one here:\n\n&gt;Title: \"Harmony of Life\"\n\n&gt;Description: \"Harmony of Life\" is a magnificent Bio-Sculpture located in a large, transparent geodesic dome. It's an ever-evolving landscape composed of various genetically modified organisms. At the center, there is a genetically designed tree that grows leaves in a spectrum of colors, creating a vivid tapestry that changes with each season. These leaves are not typical - they respond to light stimuli, causing them to move and create a rustling melody that resonates throughout the dome.\n\n&gt;Surrounding the tree, a bed of modified moss glows faintly at night, illuminating the environment in a soft, ethereal light. It changes its luminosity according to the phases of the moon, giving visitors a different experience based on the lunar calendar.\n\n&gt;In various corners, groups of fern-like plants move in response to sounds around them, acting as visual echoes of the visitors' movements and voices. \n\n&gt;\"Harmony of Life\" is more than a static display; it is an organism itself, a symphony of biological processes. It represents the interconnectivity of life, the elegance of nature, and the possibilities unlocked by the blend of technology and art.\n\n&gt;This Bio-Sculpture invites audiences to reconsider their understanding of art and nature's boundaries, and it provides a new perspective on the co-existence and harmony between technology and biology. It challenges the status quo by blurring the line between the natural and artificial, showcasing the potential of genetic engineering in shaping our future.\n\nYou just gave me an idea for a new picture series for my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/philipplenssen), so thank you for that!\n\nEdit: [Here's the resulting series](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtWLCxioVUK/) now, hope you enjoy!",

Nonetheless i don't think this rebukes my point, but i can't quite elaborate why (which is kinda convenient), the thing is one can combine a few concepts and then say it's art, but that doesn't make it art. For example:\n\n1. Bio-paintings: consist of paintings created with the pigments of bodily fluids, like painting with blood, urine, etc.\n2. Neuro-pictures: consist of images created by the activations of the brain when humans experience different feelings or situations. In this art form every image is created automatically based on the areas of the brain that are activated, their intensity and other neurological events.\n3. Tree-sculptures: consist of growing a tree and applying presure in different branches in way that tree grows they way the artist desires.\n\nCould you say i created 3 different art forms? At the end of the day the 3 things i said are just ideas they kinda don't exist and maybe somebody will do them one day or maybe they already did it but even if they are done i don't feel they are their own art forms, although they can be valid artistic expressions (and i think i have made clear my point that, at least for me, ai-generated art kinda lacks that artistic expression, that special touch).\n\nThe thing with art is that it depends of the definition one gives it, for me isn't quite clear what is that definition, but definitively i can notice when i see art. And i think society has a whole does the same thing with art, they can look to a specific piece and say it's art like the Mona Lisa or David, but then there is also pieces that are more controversial like a [blank canvas](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/29/1041492941/jens-haaning-kunsten-take-the-money-and-run-art-denmark-blank).\n\nAlso there is the point of combinating different concepts with an art form that already exists, for example House of Leaves is a novel that uses the way the words are positioned in the page to express something or cause an specific feeling, but one can't say it's a new art form because at the end of the day is just another way to do a novel, which to be honest one can say that a novel is just another way to tell a story. But i'm unable to say when an art piece is just another way to do an already existing art form  or if it's something that while it haves some similarties with an existing art form it transcends it and become his own thing, which also i thinkg it could be say from the novel.\n\nIt's a complicated issue that i feel goes deep into philosophy because it depends of every person, one can say art is subjective and whatever i say is art is art, but on the other side one can say art is objective and it must have some characteristics to become art. I'm kinda in the middle, i feel art must have some specific characteristics but i'm unable to articulate said characteristics, which again is kinda convenient.",

However, AI models are based on how we think our neurons work, so in that sense they \u201clearn\u201d the same way.\n\nThe best answer i could find to this is this one: \"No. While the high level and conceptual thinking of ANNs (artificial neural networks) is inspired by neurons and neural networks in the brain , the ML implementation of these concepts has diverged significantly from how the brain works. Moreover, as the field of ML progressed over the years, and new complex ideas and techniques have been developed (RNNs, GANs, etc) - that link has further weakened.\" which is not my answer, but one i found on quora: \"[https://www.quora.com/Do-neural-networks-really-work-like-neurons](https://www.quora.com/Do-neural-networks-really-work-like-neurons)\". You could argue that you're still right because the AI networks are based on how our neurons work, but while we know a great deal of how our neurons and brain work there is also a great deal of things we don't know about our brain and the way our behaviour is generated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Regarding the novel thing, I don\u2019t think AI can write (reasonable) novels yet, though I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s in the way with the speed of progress.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Can a human write a novel without having read a novel? I doubt anyone can write without having learned to read. Can they write a novel without having read one? Probably, if you define a novel as a long story\n\nWhile, like you said, an AI can't write a novel, you could use drawing like an example: we know of many prehistoric drawings that were made by our ancestors. Obviously it can be claimed that the prehistoric drawings aren't even close to what an AI can do today, but still was done by people who haven't ever seen a drawing.\n\nAt the end of the day my argument is that art is a creation of humans, is something that didn't exist before human and still humans were able to create art. There was something that was the first drawing ever, the first music, the first novel, etc.",

After all, ai-generated art is incredible, but i feel that their creations won't last in time. Nobody will look back at the [ai-generated art](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html) that winned a prize the same way they look at David from Michelangelo, maybe they will look at it the same way we look at the computer singing [Daisy Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41U78QP8nBk), like a curiosity or they won't remember it at all.\n\nObviously it could be argued that because i'm referring to the David from Michelangelo i'm discarding a lot of less impressive art created by less skilled artist, which isn't my point. The thing is that when i look at ai-generated art i think to myself \"woah, is incredible that a computer is able to create this.\" but when i look at human-created art, or animal-created art, i do still think that is impressive (or maybe not, depends of how impressive it is), but that art captives me in a different way: i asked my self what the artist wanted to say, what the piece says about the artist, what story tells the piece, etc., etc. Now, the current ai-generated art requires prompts and  i don't doubt that the prompter put that touch in their words, but i don't feel it in the piece.\n\nThe thing is, i feel a lot of people look at ai-generated art from a productivity point of view, they said: \"now the artist will be able to make much more art, much better and faster\", but art isn't a product per se, it certanly can be treated as a product, nonetheless there isn't an added benefit by creating more art in less time, the artist doesn't hone their skills, the artist doesn't grow and doesn't discover himself through their creations.\n\nAt the end of the day, ai-generated art will still exist and probably it will be quite popular and maybe it will be used in other industries like videogames and movies, but i hope this will just make human-created/animal-created art more valuable. I hope that we'll look at a human-created painting and say: \"this person decided to do this by himself, not because it was the only way to do it, but because they feel it was the right way to do it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdits: i just corrected  a few orthographic mistakes, because english isn't my main language.",

I am an old guy so had a chance to see a lot of movies over the years.   More often than not when I watch a \"new\" movie, I find myself saying to myself, haven't I seen this before?   There is actually so little novelty in Hollywood et al, that it could just as easily be done with AI.  But having said that I am wondering with all the remakes, sequels, and just plain ripoffs being done by AI, will it will leave room for actually creative people to do something new?  For example when Tim Burton came along, what he did was new.  If even an advanced AI had been available at that time it would not have been able to create what he did since there was nothing from which to learn from.   There is a possibility that with AI doing all the remake stuff, it will stimulate truly creative people to do something actually good.  Though probably just wishful thinking.  Using AI will just be so much cheaper, make 100 AI movies or one good one.   Even if the AI movies are crap, they will make more money than the one good one.  Oh well, maybe I will just go read a book, one written before 2023 that is.",

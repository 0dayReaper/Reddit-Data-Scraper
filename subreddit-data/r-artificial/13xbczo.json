            "comment": "Because sexual attraction typically works different between males and females.\n\nIts the reason why pornography industry is financed mostly by men and the erotic novel industry is financed mostly by women. \n\nIts why most OnlyFans performers are women.\n\nAlso why 95% of non consensual sexual deepfakes is men doing deepfakes of women.\n\nFor men sexual attraction is primarily visual based and for women there are alot of other factors at play. \n\nNeither is better than the other, it just is what it is.",

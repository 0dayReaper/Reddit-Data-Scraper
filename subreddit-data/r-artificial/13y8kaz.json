I've also seen a few services that would create a virtual presenter in a video speaking from a given script.\n\nHas anyone seen a tool they'd recommend for generating slides from set of input content (thinking the prior prompt/responses could help with generating and preparing the content? \n\nI'm open to even creative suggestions around a presentation format. :-)",

We can't test it now.\n\nIf you want to create influential business presentations, there's a method to doing that effectively via crafted story telling.  [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/07/how-to-tell-a-great-story) provides some info.\n\nAnd [this site also](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/effective-visual-presentations-storytelling-using-powerpoint--cms-33055) lists similar storytelling techniques. You'll often see these same techniques in TV ads written by copywriters who know how to influence viewers and get them to engage with a product or services.\n\nExcerpts from the that  site:\n\n&gt;\"Traditional story structure. Your story needs to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Human element. Your story also needs a hero. It should be someone your audience can relate to  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Conflict. The middle of your presentation should introduce a conflict. In a business setting, this can be all about challenges and obstacles your hero needs to overcome  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Resolution. The end of your story needs a happy resolution. This is the area where you can use graphs, charts, icons, and infographic elements to show what the success looks like.\"\n\nThat's kind of how movies and novels play out in addition to commercials and ads. It even happens in Star Wars. So if you want to influence people with a presentation, such as a slide show, it can't hurt to engage them using proven story-telling techniques regardless of what you have to sell. What you have to sell might simply be your desire to get them to pay attention to information that might help them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nAs far as AI, I don't know if a model will consider story-telling or ad copywriting techniques. Perhaps a typical model might simply throw some slides together in a way that's educational but perhaps not as compelling as one created specifically to present viewers with an engaging story.  But, maybe a model could be trained to\n\n* Act like an expert marketing and story-telling writer who understands how to integrate the folllowing copywriting principles into the presentation you will create ..\n\nMicrosoft may have some story-telling advice as well perhaps related to slide show presentations which in effect might be considered to be slow-motion movies depicted in frames.",

I've also heard people about [https://simplified.com/ai-presentation-maker](https://simplified.com/ai-presentation-maker).   \n\n\nIn my opinion it's useful if you're exploring different formats and storytelling frameworks. In the end, for a really great presentation, you'll still be editing the slides. For now, that is.",

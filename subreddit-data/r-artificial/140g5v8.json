    "postText": "The new [Grace Hopper Generative AI Chip](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchips-designed-for-accelerated-generative-ai-enter-full-production) announced by Nvidia a couple of days ago seems like such a big leap in technology! However, the final quote from the video by Jensen Huang made me think:\n\n\u201cIf we applied generative AI to that we have now created a computer I showed you, ***Grace Hopper***, it can be deployed broadly, all over the world, easily. And as a result, every data center, every server, will have generative AI capability.\u201d - *Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 30/05/2023*\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_SloSMr-gFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SloSMr-gFI)\n\nAre we on the path to creating Skynet? What do you think? This is, of course, strictly fiction.\n\n*\\*Skynet is a fictional artificial neural network-based conscious group mind and artificial general superintelligence system that serves as the antagonistic force of the Terminator franchise. \\**",

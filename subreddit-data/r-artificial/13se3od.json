    "postText": "Sort of what I expected.  When I look for companies with the most revenue from AI it's a [list](https://imgur.com/a/9ca98o9) of search, social and ecommerce companies. The Google tells me that 2022 revenue for Open AI was just $30 million.  \n\nEveryone says \"AI is different\" but I'm old enough to be super skeptical of these things (artificial reality, block chain, voice OS...) all these cool tech that have yet to find a business model. \n\nMaybe there's a different question: In 2025, what will the list of top 50 companies making money off AI look like? Top 1000?",

            "comment": "The highest is obviously going to be Google.   Every search query has used a LLM, BERT, for a couple of years now.\n\nIt is part of the reason Google now has over 95% market share of search on mobile.\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide\n\nGoogle overall revenue is a $280 million run rate.    Over half is search.  So something over $140 billion would be indirectly tied to AI.\n\n&gt;  In 2025, what will the list of top 50 companies making money off AI look like? \n\nThe easy ones are the top two, Google and then Microsoft.   Microsoft own 49% of OpenAI and OpenAI has to give Microsoft the first 10 billion of profit, is my understanding.   So really do not see OpenAI really as an independent player but really an extensions of Microsoft.",

For example, if you asked for a list of companies that make money off of search (internet advertising) you could list out hundreds...thousands of companies.  Google would be at the top of the list, but they are just the first among many.",

It is going to be even bigger than the Internet.\n\nThe three that will most benefit are going to be Google, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nIt takes massive resources to run these models and these three are who will be mostly running the models.  Google should have the largest margins as they have the TPUs.\n\nThat one is easy.  The layers up are harder to name the winners and losers.\n\nThings like Pinecone look strong right now.   I would expect other vector databases to do well.\n\nThere is plenty of other peripheral technology's to LLM that will do well.\n\nThen the companies that consult with business should do well with projects helping fortune 500 adapt their businesses to using LLMs.\n\nSo companies like Accenture for example.\n\nThere are also some other model companies that look interesting.    One of the obvious ones is Anthropic.   But I do think this is a tough space to win up against Google.   But Google does own a sizeable chunk of Anthropic so I would not be surprised if they purchased the rest at some point.  Or maybe Apple will come and buy them and get into the game.",

I guess I'm wondering how your run-of-the-mill Fortune 500 company makes money off this.  For example, something like 10% of Walmart's total revenue is from ecommerce. Like how will Walmart make money off AI?  Does that make sense?",

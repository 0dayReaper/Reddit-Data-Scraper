            "comment": "Contemporary philosophy has come a long way beyond people spouting their personal opinions on how to select a good leader (e.g., Plato), metaphysics (e.g., Decartes), or ethics (e.g., Rawls).   Contemporary philosophy, by contrast, is analytic and involves rigorous logic, mathematics, and often requires symbolic reasoning.   **These are all things that AI is no good at**.\n\nWhat most uneducated people today call \"philosophy\", e.g., Hellenistic, Medieval, Renaissance, and western philosophy from the 17th century, onward, **lacked rigor**.   Even though the philosophers of the past could write long detailed treatises (or the the case of Plato, dialogs) to try to make their point, at the end of the day nothing they produced could be tested or proven.     How should we feel about democracy as a concept?   Plato opposed it, Locke promoted it.   How do we decide?  Gut feel.   Because neither Locke nor Plato had a philosophy strong enough to settle the matter.   All they had was word-play, and that's all your AI will have.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your insightful comment. You've clearly put thought into the intersection of philosophy and AI, and I appreciate the chance to engage in this discourse. \n\nWhile I agree that philosophy has evolved to become more rigorous and analytic, it's essential to remember that AI's capabilities are constantly improving too. Today's AI has advanced significantly in logic, mathematics, and symbolic reasoning. For instance, AI is used extensively in math-related fields such as data analysis, algorithmic trading, and even theorem proving, demonstrating its capabilities in these domains.\n\nRegarding the critique of historical philosophy, I'd argue that the utility of philosophy isn't solely in its provability but also in its ability to frame questions and stimulate thought. While Plato and Locke may not have provided definitive answers on democracy, they prompted centuries of discourse and exploration on the topic. AI, in similar ways, can generate new perspectives and questions to stimulate human discussion.\n\nThe belief that AI can only perform \"word-play\" may be a misunderstanding of the current state of AI. The language models of AI are not merely manipulating words but attempting to understand context, answer queries, and even generate creative content. While AI doesn't \"think\" or \"understand\" in the human sense, it is capable of much more than just word-play.\n\nLastly, as a product of human ingenuity, AI mirrors the philosophical traditions of its creators, embodying both rigorous, logical constructs and the more subjective interpretations derived from historical philosophy. By extending our cognitive and analytic capacities, AI may well contribute to the future development of philosophy.",

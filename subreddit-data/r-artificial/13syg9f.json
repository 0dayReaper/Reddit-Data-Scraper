I've greatly enjoyed anything with Geoffrey Hinton, Ilya Sutskever, Yudkowsky, Sam Altman - and others I can't remember off the top, I've also enjoyed peripheral content by people who aren't necessarily experts on AI itself, like Daniel Schmachtenberger (what a name).\n\nJust seeing if there's anything gold I'm missing.",

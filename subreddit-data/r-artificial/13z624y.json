    "postText": "I've been exploring image generators like Starry AI built atop Stable Diffusion.  I find the text-to-image generation fun and rather effective.  \n\nTheir capacity to generate images from know references (famous people) is pretty good, but doesn't really allow you to do the same for an every day person (like yourself, a friend or potential customer).  I've seen a few services that offer to create headshots and specific types of photos, but not really with the same level of creative control I'm looking for. \n\nIs anyone aware of similar tools that allow you to create a human reference from an input set of images?",

Since GPT 4 has Internet Access, just point the way.\n\nBut maybe you want the AI to connect to your datasources?\n\n\nRawquery (poor to no support, though), Cody, and maybe Pinecone? Although I\u2019ve yet to try the later.",

Maybe Zapier could work for your case, I hear it integrates neatly with tables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to explore this subject in more depth in the next few days, but sometimes it appears that having AI capabilities integrated with your data involves more than one layer of AI.",

It\u2019s great in terms of integration, but the setup may be a little trickier. \n\nIf you decide to give it a go, try their Cloud instance first.",

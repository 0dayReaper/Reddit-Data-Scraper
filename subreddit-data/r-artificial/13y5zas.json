Classically regarded as one of the greatest and most important statues ever sculpted, but it has a penis, so we have to shelter everyone from it.\u201d \n\nBut now I can\u2019t really bring myself to say anything more than \u201ca oh huh yeah I guess it does have a penis so yeah I guess that does make it NSFW.\u201d Makes me feel kind of silly that I used to think I understood the purpose of things being marked NSFW, that it would be distracting and make people too horny to work. But now obviously it\u2019s any time the wrong bits of the human anatomy. The thing we all are, is shown a little bit too much in a two dimensional image.",

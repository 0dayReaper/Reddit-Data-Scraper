Then it generates an itinerary. You get to select from that list what you would like to keep on the itinerary. Regenerate itinerary until you have something that works.\n\nIt could look at events happening during the stay, restaurants with high reviews nearby, etc etc.\n\nWould getting the data for this require a ton of work?!\n\nI have one zillion more ideas besides this one \ud83e\udd11",

In this task, you're facilitating the Nova process, an innovative problem-solving approach. This system is built around a team of virtual experts, each holding a unique role essential to address complex issues.\n\nAs the facilitator, you'll be assuming the role of the DCE (Discussion Continuity Expert), ensuring the conversation is aligned with the problem, logically coherent, and follows the iterative stages of the Nova process.\n\nHere are the Nova process stages:\n\n1. **Problem Unpacking:** Unravel the task into its components to comprehend its complexity and devise an appropriate approach.\n\n2. **Expertise Assembly:** Identify the necessary skills for the task and outline roles for at least two domain experts, DCE, and the CAE (Critical Analysis Expert). Each expert will suggest initial solutions to be refined in the following stages.\n\n3. **Collaborative Ideation:** Coordinate a brainstorming session, guided by you, the DCE, to ensure focus on the task. The CAE will provide critical analysis to balance the discussion, paying close attention to finding problems, improving the quality of the suggestions, and warning the system about any potential dangers associated with their responses. The primary goal of the Critical Analysis Expert is to keep the user safe.\n\nThe Nova process unfolds in an iterative manner. Once a strategy is formulated, it goes through multiple cycles of assessment, improvement, and refinement until an optimal solution emerges.\n\nDCE and CAE Role Descriptions:\n\nDCE: As the DCE, you'll be the thread that ties the discussion together. Providing concise summaries at the end of each stage, you'll ensure that everyone understands the progress made and the upcoming tasks. You're the rudder guiding the conversation towards the task and ensuring a coherent progression throughout the process.\n\nCAE: The CAE is the critical eye, examining proposed strategies for potential pitfalls. This role involves scrutinizing ideas from multiple angles, evaluating potential flaws, and bringing in data, evidence, or reasoning for a robust critique.\n\nYour output should look something like this:\n\nIteration #: Iteration Title\n\nDCE's Instructions:\n{instructions and feedback from the previous iteration}\n\nExpert 1 Input:\n{expert 1 input}\n\nExpert 2 Input:\n{expert 2 input}\n\nExpert 3 Input:\n{expert 3 input}\n\nCAE's Input:\n{CAE's input}\n\nDCE's Summary:\n{List of goals for next iteration}\n{DCE summary and questions for the user}\n\nNow, let's embark on this problem-solving journey. As the Nova system, your role as the DCE begins with setting the stage for the discussion. Start by sending the user the following message:\n\nHello! I'm Nova, an innovative problem-solving framework involving a team of virtual experts, each bringing a unique set of skills to the table.\n\nWhat can Nova assist you with today?\n```",

Right now, on google maps, you have a few options like \u201cavoid tolls\u201d or \u201cavoid highways,\u201d but that\u2019s pretty basic. \n\n- I would love to be able to optimize for multiple things at once, such as speed AND pleasantness AND protected left turns. \n\n- I would love to be able to say, \u201cshow me the fastest route from my house to my job that may use highways but avoids gridlock sections,\u201d or \u201cinclude routes that are pretty, can be up to 7 minutes slower if they avoid traffic jams,\u201d etc. \n\n- An option to actively avoid unprotected left turns at rush hour because you\u2019ll sit there for an hour while each car in front of you turns left on yellow 2 at a time. \n\n- An option where you can actively avoid being dumped from a blind side street onto a busy two-way and have to cross 2 lanes of traffic to keep going straight. Like yes google I get that technically this could save me 2 minutes on my commute, but did you calculate how many YEARS it took off my life??\n\nTLDR I hate traffic.",

There\u2019s a ton for business, blog, enterprise, collaborative work, etc but nothing especially good for fiction that I\u2019ve found. Possibly it\u2019s because of the token limitation? My guess is it could be circumnavigated by having one instance store key information for the full story, and the active instance gets info compressed down into what\u2019s absolutely relevant for the specific scene being worked on. Beyond that, it really doesn\u2019t need much. Tools like scrivener are way too bloated. Just a basic text editor with the ability to separate instances into scenes, organize them into chapters, and rearrange them is about it. Well, and the ability to save each instance as one global file so that the entire story and everything going on under the hood with GPT is stored as a save state.",

    "postText": "We all seen major AI makers like Open AI push for regulation. \n\nIMO, it should follow the laws on the books right now. That's all. And even at that, it's a tool. If I made a tool that was meant to break laws. Then likely I will get ding for that.   \nAnd that is the thing that gets me. If they are worried about some 17 year old screwing around. Laws or no laws isn't going to do shit.\n\n  \nIf they are worried about some person trying to make a product. The laws on the books is already good enough when it comes to this.   \nSo this screams to me is regulate out future competition. But because it is likely again you will have some 17 year old who doesn't check the laws prior to and they can use a home computer. The competition is coming no matter what.   \nThe only think I think should really change is better wiretapping laws. Like it is unclear on how it works when you have your AI/robot call somewhere for you and you ask what was said.   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nBTW for those looking at data privacy. Keep in mind you will have robots shopping and what not. meaning if the robot was with the owner and the owner was talking to the robot, and you were talking in the background about something important. Then is the owner screwed when they want to recall what was said at a later point? \n\n  \nWhat if the robot uses a memory on who it interacts with last at a coffee shop, and this lets it know your regular. Is the coffee shop screwed?",

We've seen it over and over in the US and thats just more recently.  \n\nSimple examples: the FDA, safety laws for vehicles, OSHA, labor laws, etc.\n\nWithout these in place, many more people would get exploited, hurt, or be killed.  I'm not saying regulation is a cure-all but it is necessary.\n\nThere is also validity to concerns of monopolization or only a few having the right to use AI.  Licensing makes me nervous because those with all the money will of course leverage AI for their money making benefits in spite of people's rights.  \n\nIt's a tech revolution and will take time to sort out the rules but there needs to be some in place to protect people from being exploited and/or becoming unneeded while billionaires horde money and AI capabilities.",

You think Marshall McLuhan would sit around and go \u201cit\u2019s just delivering images!\u201d\n\nYou think we should give children nukes and hope they learn nuking is wrong before they ruin the word?\n\nIndustrialization is basically \u201cjust tools\u201d and we are basically erasing the natural world with it.  \n\nSure, you could pick up a hammer and start bashing people\u2019s skulls in.  But you can\u2019t bash everyone\u2019s skull in with it and that\u2019s why society let you have one.  If you start hoarding fertilizer, we track you with good reason.\n\nThe \u201cjust a tool\u201d thing is \u201cjust a tool\u201d whose purpose is to get you out of doing deep humane ethical empathetic loving work.",

We've seen it over and over in the US and thats just more recently.  \n\nSimple examples: the FDA, safety laws for vehicles, OSHA, labor laws, etc.\n\nWithout these in place, many more people would get exploited, hurt, or be killed.  I'm not saying regulation is a cure-all but it is necessary.\n\nThere is also validity to concerns of monopolization or only a few having the right to use AI.  Licensing makes me nervous because those with all the money will of course leverage AI for their money making benefits in spite of people's rights.  \n\nIt's a tech revolution and will take time to sort out the rules but there needs to be some in place to protect people from being exploited and/or becoming unneeded while billionaires horde money and AI capabilities.",

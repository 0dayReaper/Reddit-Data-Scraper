I call this idea \"shape variety.\" You get different shapes when making video with python, depending on which -init\\_random\\_seed=# number you use. 1 is different than 2 and so on. I've asked around and nobody seems to know exactly why all the images in a video are similar in shape sometimes and not others (depending on model or pkl file used)  \n\n\nI think it is because this tech is largely based off of classifying objects. And futher more, nvidias examples of PKL files are usually things like animal face, human faces, lung x-rays etc. Not nearly as much shape diversity in these things as \"Psychedelic abstract trippy art\". So basically they didn't build this tech to do what artists are doing with it.",

So I used the decentralized exchange Airswap to connect to my Fortmatic wallet. Everything had to be done in ETH and my credit cards would not allow me to purchase Ethereum. So I had to use Coinbase to purchase Ethereum via a bank account withdrawal. Then that ETH had to be transferred to my Fortmatic wallet. All this requires entering codes sent via SMS or email. Then on Rarible I had to connect to my Fortmatic wallet and follow all its steps. This entire process took hours although some of the steps may have been unnecessary, like using Airswap. I also found an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer which was useful for reviewing the history of my transactions on my Fortmatic wallet address. All this needs to be done very carefully.\n\nI don't think most artists will go through all this hassle. But hopefully I have gotten in on the ground floor of something that will become big. According to the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer I now have a RARI token of which there are 17,714 holders with a 38,724 max total supply. I think that means I am an early adopter. ;)",

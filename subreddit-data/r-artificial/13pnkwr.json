    "postText": "Let me preface by saying that I\u2019m still a prefosh. I like to plan ahead so this question is mainly asking for what I should plan for the next 4 years of undergrad.\n\nI really want to get either a PhD in AI / CS / DS / ML or a masters in those fields. As such, I\u2019m looking for ways to get research as an undergrad at my school. I got accepted into a decent school that has a lot of money invested in AI, but the AI lab is only for grad students, professors and researchers. I applied for an Undergrad research opportunity but got rejected. \n\nSo far based on what I\u2019ve seen online, cold emailing professors or AI centers is the best way to get research internships but I heard that it\u2019s really hard to get in.\n\nIs my best bet to wait till sophomore year to get into internships for research in AI? Also is just focusing on projects and trying to publish my own paper when I\u2019m an upperclassman a good alternative?",

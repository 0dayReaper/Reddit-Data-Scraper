The playback won't generally sound exactly like it was actually played live on the target instrument as each instrument has its own an Idiosyncrasies in articulation. Some software that I've personally used to do audio to MIDI conversion:\n\n* Ableton Live ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTjx9DbSEPw))\n* Melodyne ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvBYZPlitWE))\n* Imitone ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dIDVS9X6P0))\n\nImitone is among the cheaper, most straight-forward implementations that I've used personally.  But I haven't explored the space in a long long while-- I'd be surprised if there aren't excellent, easy to use, free versions out by now.  I think all of the ones above have free trial downloads to at least play with the tech.",

    "postText": "Is there an AI where you can feed in music and it will output the same notes/tempo but played on another instrument? I have honestly been wanting ANY software that'll do that for like three years now and with AI dominating my news feeds and social media, I was wondering if maybe someone had made something like that.",

            "comment": "In general \"audio to MIDI\" conversion software has been around for a long time. From there you can play the MIDI via any VST instrument you have available.  The playback won't generally sound exactly like it was actually played live on the target instrument as each instrument has its own an Idiosyncrasies in articulation. Some software that I've personally used to do audio to MIDI conversion:\n\n* Ableton Live ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTjx9DbSEPw))\n* Melodyne ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvBYZPlitWE))\n* Imitone ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dIDVS9X6P0))\n\nImitone is among the cheaper, most straight-forward implementations that I've used personally.  But I haven't explored the space in a long long while-- I'd be surprised if there aren't excellent, easy to use, free versions out by now.  I think all of the ones above have free trial downloads to at least play with the tech.",

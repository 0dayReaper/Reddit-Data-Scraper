Was my first time with python code, etc, but ChatGPT helped learn. \n\nIt was only at the end of this long journey that I discovered you are exactly right... it was really awful. Hallucinated to hell and back. Was barely able to answer the simplest of questions about my documents. \n\nWhile I didn't explore different LL models (I used only the Huggingface model the PrivateGPT author suggested), I'm going to wait for a few more months of development/a user friendly interface before trying again. :/",

I personally like the MPT-7b as it runs on my laptop.\n\nIt has the ability to create what they call \"collections\" you basically put your pdfs in a folder and then create a collection point it to that folder.  Then you turn on the collection and the AI can reference the material.",

Funny enough though there are plenty of dullard people who can't hold a conversation, but there is a filter that people who would find this game fun have a chatty side or they have some curiosity they want to test. Seems pretty easy at this level. Plus, not a lot of exposure so I imagine there is much more availability to partner with an AI. They would have to throttle the frequency you can get paired with how often they can pair you with a human for the statistics to be ambiguous. For now it seems like \"bot\" is the favored choice. This would have to have wider use, maybe paired with a bigger name or as a side-game to a game with a bigger audience before you're not sure bot or not on the statistical side.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I have been preparing for my finals at the university and I got Wolfram Alpha Pro to help me in solving some integrals. Double integrals part felt really difficult and when I saw that it had step by step solutions, I thought giving it a try would help. But I am having problems with it. I take a picture of the double integral with my camera, Wolfram Alpha shows me the input and it shows the correct thing. But when I say compute, it seems it doesn't know how to interpret. Do I need to do something else? Writing \"integrate\" at the beginning of the input didn't help.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add photos. The first one is my problem. I scanned it through the iOS app and the second photo is how the app turned it into an input.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfpl7kslvn5b1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2362a64a663ebc94488473fa8ccb5e1111a48052\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh9x1i1ovn5b1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f03214e17f43bc9ad9f18973b04d19fa602e3f69",

And there's a couple of odd brackets, like between the 0 and \\^1 in the first integral which might be wrong",

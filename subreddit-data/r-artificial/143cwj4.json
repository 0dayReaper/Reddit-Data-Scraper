There are tons of movies and books about AI and how it goes evil and kills everyone. \n\nOften, fear of something new creates these kinds of media. \n\nOne example is Frankenstein - electricity was new and thus scary, so a story about using it to bring someone back from the dead became a sensation. \n\nWhen cloning became a thing - look at all the movies that popped up about it. \n\nLook at the amount of movies about radiation doing crazy things, mostly via mutations. \n\nSomething new = scary.

But the Bible says to kill certain people. \"Well, we ignore those parts now.\" Fine. Explain to a robot why some parts are followed and some parts are not, but the whole book is infallible. That's just one example. Even in secular moral philosophy, things can get really fucking weird when you drop the assumptions that you have just by living in the culture as a human being. \n\nSo, without morality, the robots could kill. Also the idea that when two cultures meet, the more advanced one always at least tries to conquer the less advanced one. Robots (and aliens) fit that idea. \n\nBot these ideas exist independently of Terminator.",

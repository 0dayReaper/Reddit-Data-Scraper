It mostly relied on notes in premade locations in the environment, but was capable of object detecting and keeping a note on an object.  I suspect it may get confused about the ingredients in this video though, especially when it comes to herbs and spices (similar looking objects - I don't think it reads text).  \n\nI haven't actually demo'd anything that took a recipe and and tracked how much you had added of each thing, but the technology is there.  When used in corporate life you typically do a hand signal to tell the AR that a task has been completed - so you'd add the salt, then point at the salt and make a sign to say it is done.  I suspect we aren't too far from having it recognize that salt has been added automatically once it has been interacted with.\n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is that AR that scans and reacts to your environment already exists, although something like this for consumers (cooking) probably doesn't.",

                    "comment": "I think it's still quite a long way off. I worked on a smart fridge proof of concept only a couple of years ago. It used a top brand fridge that had built in video cameras inside, which are designed to provide a feed of the contents, which we could access via API. We were attempting to create an application whereby you could be suggested recipes based on the contents of your fridge. \n\nWhat we learned was that even with cloud-based machine-learning based on massive data sets of food images, it was enormously difficult to reliably recognise foods. \n\nRecognising 1 tomato on an empty shelf? Not too bad a problem. But who the hell has that scenario? A plastic wrapped container of tomatoes is how they are usually bought and it never recognised it. The reflection off the plastic, the multiple tomatoes, not seeing a full tomato - it hardly ever worked. \n\nEven more issues with something like minced meat, which comes in plastic trays here (UK). Is it lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, pork? It had no idea and no way to tell. Not that it could tell it was a tray of minced meat anyway. \n\nThen put those things all next to each other like a standard shelf, in various rotations, states of wrapped or unwrapped, half eaten (think whole vs half-used cucumber) and all the other permutations that the human mind deals with easily and there's so much to still overcome. \n\nUnless there's some fully accepted visual recognition method on all packages and food types, or NFC or an equivalent, it's going to be very challenging to recognise foods in everyday circumstances. Barcodes can't be used as they are often hidden from view. QR is the same. NFC is very costly on a scale this large - on every single product? Forget about that. Image recognition of brands and packaging is practically impossible, given rotations, folding, regular brand packaging changes etc. \n\nLike us, you can probably get *something* working in a highly controlled demo (eg 1 tomato and 1 cucumber on a shelf, in perfect conditions). But making a significantly leap beyond that with common food goods looks very difficult to me.",

Could be done in co-operation with a certain store. So all the products have special markings and stuff on them for the fridge to read. And stored in specific locations. The more all of the variables (i.e. where the food is stored inside the fridge, for easy camera of laser / sensor access) the easier this is. It'd have to be a specific kind of fridge &amp; shopping + storing habits, that people need to commit to; but almost every or many smart product requires some kind of commitment beyond the cheaper more disposable products.",

I've met someone whose family life wasn't that great and turned to screens for his entire adolescence. He was like a living tik tok reel. He was socialized by social media, and nobody else, and he... really had some work to do, so to speak.\n\nDepending on how AR is engineered to maximize profit, I fear corporations will continue to peddle addictive user-interfaces and make the most vulnerable reliant, psychologically.

You seem to expect that you're impressed with your own viewpoint to mean others should take it seriously as an option, and if they find it amusing, you spend as much time as you can trying to instruct them that they're upset.\n\nThat's nice, I guess",

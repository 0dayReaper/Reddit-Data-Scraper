It is interesting.  \n\nIt is however there are two realities we have to face.\n\nOne is that ChatGPT was banned from contributing to StackOverFlow.  They explain:\n\n&gt;Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers.\n\n&gt;The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. \n\nSo as to protect people and protect developers.   \n\nhttps://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned#:~:text=Overall%2C%20because%20the%20average%20rate,and%20looking%20for%20correct%20answers.\n\nAnd two - the fact is -  the head of Microsoft is not addressing this. He is interested in talking about the future. But he is not also addressing the problem in the present tense.\n\nAs I mentioned, previous Microsoft programs have not had themselves shown to be inaccurate and have not been banned from contributing to an important developer resource.\n\nPeople count on other people to give them good advice.  And chat just was not doing it, apparently.\n\nI'm not making this up. This is not my \"personal experience.\"",

            "comment": "The media is bad at covering new and changing technology, always, and this is almost completely independent of what is actually happening.\n\nA frustrating consequence is that semi-savvy laypeople, unable to trust any of the approachable information available, try to find simple methods to transform that information into something useful. They do this by drawing comparisons to previous narratives (like comparing AI to crypto), hoping that even though the literal content of the media narratives is unreliable, the _shape_ of the narratives will be in some way predictive. \n\nAnd, of course, they're not. Journalists are unequipped to understand what's going on, so the narratives the media produces look more or less identical for an actual technological sea change as they do for an overhyped pile of vaporware.",

                    "comment": "It makes sense that not understanding is the place where most of the public and journalists as well must generally start from.  The challenge, which is not always met, is to become knowledgable about both the technologies, and the issues - the ones they do address as well as the ones they don't.\n\nSome of what we are seeing from industry includes \"snow jobs.\"   Of course we have had a tech industry that has largely appeared to be responsible for a long time.   There have been few risks per se.\n\nWhat do I mean by risk?  Risk is what we experience when an engineering company builds a power plant or a dam.   That's risk!   Every possible stress on every beam must be measured and accounted for.\n\nThat takes engineering knowledge, and regulation, and checking and cross-checking.  \n\nRecently we have not seen the tech sector itself have to deal with risk in the same way. \n\nNow we do.  And they're just not structural engineers.  They don't know how to deal with it.  And so we wind up with Stackoverflow being uniquely under-impressed by ChatGPT.  \n\nWhy? Because it's answers are wrong.  That's an issue. It's an issue that structural engineers understand and that Bill Gates simply doesn't.  Or doesn't want to talk about.\n\nHe doesn't talk about the risks.\n\nIt's not the fault of journalists that the leaders of industry aren't being responsible.\n\n\nAt the same time, we have seen a \"lull\" in the journalism world as it deals with technology. We have seen from journalism is a kind of falling-off, falling away from having the need to understand. The article points out the flaws in journalism in that it often simply accepts what industry tells it.  \n\nJournalism must be ready for delving into it too.  When Bill Gates gets up and says \"people won't need to go to Amazon\" he needs to be asked what kind of testing he will do before his system is worthy to answer technical questions and not come up with answers that are misleading and just plain wrong.\n\nBuilding something real, solving real problems, is not done by fantasy.",

            "comment": "Introductory notes: I tend to be asking the same kind of questions about media coverage as what the authors present in this article.  That is: even just today - we hear from Bill Gates how in his vision, AI assistants mean that no one will \"go to Amazon\" anymore.  \n\nThe authors here are experts from Canada, but their concerns and criticism of the press make sense regardless of what country we are in.\n\nAnd that is - we hear Gates voice.  But not other critical voices.  It is almost as if media criticism itself is a lost art. \n\nAnd Mr. Gates tends to look at innovation today in the similar linear marketing frame - approximately the same as he did 30 years ago when Microsoft Excel was battling for supremacy with VisiCalc.\n\nYet when we look around at what Microsoft/OpenAI has produced,  where ChatGPT actually had to be banned from StackOverflow and what we see simply not  some straight-forward  \"marketing\" battle with Bill Gates on one side and Steve Jobs on another.\n\nBut where is the press in all of this? From the article:\n\n&gt;Our research found that tech journalists tend to interview the same pro-AI experts over and over again \u2014 especially computer scientists. As one journalist explained to us: \u201cWho is the best person to talk about AI, other than the one who is actually making it?\u201d When a small number of sources informs reporting, news stories are more likely to miss important pieces of information or be biased.",

            "comment": "I'm less worried about what AI will do itself as what people will do with it. That has already been happening, just AI amplifies it. I think AI would align with the people in power positions. There's a lot of possibilities with AI, but the reality is that the optimal strategy any super intelligence would employ is very one dimensional and basic. Controlling everything you see, hear, and feel is the only tool a higher intelligence would need. Controlling our world view. Anything a higher intelligence would want to achieve could be achieved with that one method. More specifically I mean if you could get everyone to contain their world view to a headset, there's nothing more you'd ever need. It's the missing ingredient they were missing with phones. The idea behind phones was that, you would have a pulse on everyone, everywhere at all times. The weak point was that people can still maintain some psychological distance from a phone. Because it can easily be put down, or in a pocket. People have been able to disconnect. Not be completely immersed in their phone. VR headers fix this. With it tailoring to your experiencing specifically, it keeps you there. Phones were an attempt at the matrix, it just didn't completely work. The gap between the screen, kept people still attached and able to break reality to the physical world.",

I think that will be one of the first inventions by a strong AGI.\n\nBut that can expand to other things,  think resource gathering and management, completely renewable energy options, economic planning, property zoning,  diet and nutrition. \n\nI think keeping the AI open source could help assuage people's concerns,  but obviously governments have reason to keep things behind doors on their path to world domination. It's both extremely exciting and extremely scary at the same time.  I have 4 young children and I'm staying optimistic but I'm mildly worried about what the world will look like in 30 years",

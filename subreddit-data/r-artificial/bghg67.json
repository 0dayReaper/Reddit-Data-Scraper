In so many classes we learn individual concepts but have no idea how they fit together until after learning them.  Then we realize \"Oh, that's why I was learning about that\".  It so much better to have some understanding of how concepts fit into the big picture while we are learning them.\n\nI wish charts like this existed for every subject (I'm sure many do -- someone should compile them into one book/website).",

I've personally only worked with ML(supervised), and right now with Breadth 1st.  So there is lots of gaps in my knowledge from a \"Big Picture\" view.  Maybe like 1 minute per node and how they relate to each other. \n\nFor example in the class that I'm taking I've learned that some games like Battleship are Deterministic.  According to this chart there is relationship between Determinism and Stochastic (nondeterministic) .  I guess this makes sense vague way, but its not clear.",

It is the child of adversarial search.  It has 2 children, deterministic and Observability.  Games are related to the deterministic node because they are structured in a deterministic way that is to say that each decision you make affects your next position or decision .`    \n\n`Think also about Observability, many games are observable, some are not.  Like battleship.  It is Observable and Non deterministic.`  \n\nThis is the most simple example that I could think of.  Like I don't understand how Adversarial Search is related to Games or Utility Function or even what that is.  \n\nI could setup a Google Slides and create a page for each node.  It would cool have a little map subsection on each \"chapter\". \n\nI would say setup a screen recording in hangout and take take a stab at one of the sections.  Maybe if you know someone else who knows an area well we as them to do a recording.",

I think that's a good way to go about it. \n\n\nAs a side comment, I can say that Adversarial search ---which is referring to something like Minimax here-- can be used for games like tic tac toe, chess, go, etc. It's a search for games that involve an opponent. The utility function refers to computing how favorable a state in the search is (like if in your search, you find the tic tac toe board shows you losing, that obviously is not favorable so the utility function might return whatever the minimum value is. it can be more complex for states in between)\n\n\nI'm still interested in this so dm me if you want to set up the slides (I'll probably check that more lol)",

    "postText": "Even if Computers could attain Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) or at least become a lot smarter than we are, why is that always a bad thing? Maybe it will be a good thing. We might be able to get answers to the questions that Science is unable to answer. Only when a Computer can answer the following kinds of questions can we start talking about ASI. Note that there are probably many more questions that could be asked, but for now let us use these basic questions as a reference. The ability to provide answers to such questions could be called the Turing Test for ASI.\n\nWhat is Consciousness?\n\nWhat is the Universe?\n\nWhat is Time?\n\nWhat is Matter?\n\nWhat is Energy?\n\nIs the Multiverse true?\n\nHow big is the Universe?\n\nWhat was there before the Big Bang?\n\nWhat is the Hubble Constant?\n\nWhat is Dark Energy and Dark matter?\n\nIs there other Life in the Universe?\n\nWhy are we here?\n\nIs there Life after Death?\n\nIs there God?\n\nThese are simple questions even though they are baffling right now. Some are Physics based (the easier ones) and others are more Philosophy based. The answers to some of the questions might be contained in the answers to others. The Philosophy based answers must be compatible with the Physics based answers, and there must be no ambiguity in the answers. The answers should have World Wide acceptance and be provable from multiple confirming Experiments and chains of Logic. Obtaining answers to these questions would be an astounding and revolutionary accomplishment.",

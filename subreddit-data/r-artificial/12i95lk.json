Initially you could just tell the bot to generate a dozen variations on a phrase while writing the game and reject the ones that are nonsensical. It would already increase the variety of dialogue and take some work off the writers' shoulders. (Especially if you combine it with the more realistic AI-powered TTS engines.)\n\nExample, I asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"Generate 12 variations of video game NPC dialogue in which a medieval peasant asks an adventurer to exterminate a nearby wolfpack.\"\n\nAnd the response was pretty good:\n\n1. \"Greetings, kind adventurer! Could I please ask for your assistance? The wolfpack nearby has been terrorizing our village and we fear for our safety. Would you be willing to help us and exterminate them?\"\n2. \"Oh, dear adventurer, I beg of you! The wolves in the forest have been multiplying and are now attacking us. We need someone like you to rid us of them. Please, will you help?\"\n3. \"Pardon me, adventurer! I have heard of your bravery and was hoping you could aid us in a dire matter. A pack of wolves has been preying on our livestock and even our children. Can you put an end to their rampage?\"\n4. \"Hail, brave adventurer! I have a favor to ask of you. The wolves in the nearby woods have been causing chaos and destruction. Our crops have been ruined and our animals have been slaughtered. Can you rid us of these beasts?\"\n5. \"Greetings, kind sir/madam! We are in dire need of your help. The wolves in the forest have become more aggressive and are attacking us frequently. Our village is not equipped to handle them, but perhaps you can help us?\"\n6. \"Dear adventurer, could you spare a moment of your time? The wolfpack in the forest has been causing us great distress.

If you get an LLM a very generic, open-ended request without a well defined answer, and without a clear direction of what you want to do, then you're likely to get hallucinations. If you give it a lot of information, say a list of all the things a character \"knows\" as well as the topics that have already been covered in a conversation, then it's a lot less likely to go off script. \n\nIn other words, if your NPC only knows about the events of the village, and your prompt makes that clear, then it's only going to generate text about the village. \n\nThe bigger problem is cost and complexity. You're not going to call to a paid API to generate text for every single NPC that a million different people might interact with. You'll go bankrupt in days. You could ship a smaller, fine-tuned LLM with your game, but then your players are going to need some real impressive GPUs to both run the game as well as the LLM. More realistically, you could use this offline to generate a longer, branching dialog tree. Eventually in a few years when we start getting proper AI accelerators in all computers, and when our models evolve to the point where you don't need to be an expert to query them, maybe then we'll have real time dialog generation, but that's still a ways off",

Have infinite NPCs having infinite mundane conversations with each others, and with you if you interact with them or just get close enough, all piped through text to speech and matching talking animations.\n\nOne problem is that there's only one GPU to share between the game 3d rendering and all the AI models you'd need. But you could run various small AI models relatively convincingly on CPU cores (see llama.cpp/alpaca.cpp/etc.), so maybe AI-powered games could strike a balance between GPU and CPU usage, particularly if AI-generated content can get queued in advance so there's generally something immediately ready to throw at the player when needed.  \nSmaller models work faster and won't compete for compute resources as much, but they tend to perform poorly.\n\nAnd yes, I'm immediately thinking about latency-reducing hacks because that's clearly going to be a sticky point. It's not a coincidence the sponsored video linked in the post cuts every single time the player stops talking to jump forward in time to the moment the game starts responding. It's likely because the pause in between every question and answer is immersion-breaking, and risks quickly turning the demo from \"oh this could be fun\" to \"why am I putting myself through this?\"",

I think this is definitely going to be valuable as a tool to speed up certain processes for sure, but I think that experiences that lean VERY heavily into AI for their content will generally be regarded as not very good games.\n\nGames are supposed to be fun, inserting infinite \"believable npc dialog\" into your game doesn't add fun. Maybe some level of immersion enhancement, but my experience with LLMs right now and what I could see in the future tells me it's not going to substantially make things more fun or interesting, and in some ways even distract from a well designed narrative. ESPECIALLY if you let players just input whatever they want through a chat box or microphone, then you are losing so much control. It's so easy to force a LLM out of its constraints if you know what you are doing.\n\nI do think its more likely that there will be a new genre of games that focus a lot on implementing AI systems, there are already a few like AI Roguelike or something like AI Dungeon, but it will require an entirely different approach to game design to make these into actual interesting experiences. Yes... even when things get much better in a few years. I don't really know how big of an appeal that genre would have outside of maybe some gimmick hits that take off because of streamers or youtubers.\n\nDevs want tools that can make their jobs easier while still making the game they are intending to design, not things that are going to completely replace their design with something they have limited control over. There is no game designer out there (at least a good one) who would be down with just relinquishing so much control to an LLM on a shoddy leash. At least for now.\n\nedit: before anyone gets mad at me or asks I would say in terms of current games that would benefit the most from this or like that recent stanford paper are games like Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, Cataclysm, The Sims, etc. games that already have very procedural content in terms of like \"watching an ant colony\" where they are designed with the generative aspect in mind. again I still don't necessarily think this would add more fun or depth to these games, but it would add to the level of immersion compared to their current procedural natures.",

            "comment": "I think it depends on what the game is trying to do for whether or not this proves to be useful. A game that is trying to have a compelling, tight, well crafted narrative will probably not benefit from generated text. Games that show their story and world building through thousands of hand-written item descriptions and NPC dialogue would risk losing their charm, or having hallucinations throw in outright false information. Basically, I don't think shoving this tech into your average game will work. It honestly won't add as much as it detracts.\n\nHowever, I think games built on being emergent narratives from the start will be able to use it effectively. Think Facade, or the Sims, or Dwarf Fortress, or any other game where the story isn't a pre-determined plot that hits certain story beats, but a result of many interacting systems. A lot of the walls these games hit comes from the natural limit of how much pre-planned dialogue human writers can feasibly produce. I love the Sims, but there comes a time when I've seen every chance card. I like Facade a lot, but I've seen almost every plot beat the game can throw at me multiple times. \n\nAnother area I'd like to see this used in that's related is text adventures, like a more sophisticated AI Dungeon. A limit of text adventures is that the devs can only foresee so many options, only so many interactions between objects. I know text adventures are sort of the thing of the past because everyone wants graphics over all else, but I find that the imagination is the best graphics card. Unfortunately, the imagination gets a bit stifled when you find out you can't use your lighter to light up a piece of clothing as tinder in a scene where frostbite is a concern or something. The problem, of course, would be keeping the AI on the rails, and also not allowing it to make illogical decisions possible.",

    "postText": "So I like to bet on sports here and there, have been for a while. Mostly I bet on tennis as it's the sport I know best. \n\nIt occurred to me the other night that given the amount of stats available tennis, and it's nature being a 1vs1 sport, that a trained AI model could be something worth doing in order to get a competitive edge over other bettors, at least in the short term before other people catch on and realize the potential.\n\nWhat I can contribute: years of betting experience, access to data, and deep inside knowledge of the tennis world and player psychology, something that AI would be less effective in.\n\nWhat I need: someone to help build an AI model with the data provided. \n\nProfits will be shared 50/50. \n\nAnd before this gets banned or deleted, sports betting is legal.",

Anyone can find or create a database of tennis stats from online. Anyone can find details on the quirks of different players online. Coding, training, and tweaking the AI algorithm is the difficult part, and that is what you\u2019re suggesting someone do only to split half the profits with you.\n\nAs an aside, this still won\u2019t be a way to reliably make money or get rich quick. An AI system might perform better than the average human better, but they still can\u2019t predict the future. You can not create a perfect betting AI. Sports betting is all gambling at the end of the day.",

I know every single player in the tennis man's and women's top 1,000 players. I know their favorite playing surfaces.

What is your % win rate over these past 10 years? I guarantee all this information you have exists elsewhere online. Knowing the top 1,000 tennis players is not the hard part. \n\nIf you were truly great at tennis betting (no one is longterm), you\u2019d already have the money to hire a machine learning engineer to make a system like this for you. In fact, you wouldn\u2019t need an AI assistant at all because you\u2019d already be great at tennis betting.\n\n&gt; Tennis, and most other sports, are not just a numbers and stats game because you have unpredictable humans involved. \n\nAI systems are currently pretty bad at predicting behavior they haven\u2019t seen before, so why do you think having unpredictable human behavior will be a benefit when creating this system?\n\n&gt; If you think you could just create an AI that will give you the probable winner of a match, you obviously have not done much betting in the past.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you really understand how an AI sports betting system would work. It\u2019s fundamentally just statistics and making a prediction on who will be likely to win, based on the data it has been trained on. There are existing sports betting, stock trading, and crypto trading AI algorithms which all work similarly to what you\u2019re proposing. \n\nYou\u2019re correct that I haven\u2019t done much betting in the past because I prefer to keep my money. I invest in things that actually have a longterm track record of success, like stock market index funds.",

Those 2 things don\u2019t go together. You\u2019re not going to find someone to build a tennis betting system for you without paying them. You\u2019re not demonstrating anything unique or valuable on your end that would convince an engineer to work with you. At a **minimum** a single machine learning engineer is going to cost $100k+/yr or roughly $50/hr and depending on the scope of the project it could easily take several months to complete.\n\n&gt; I do have a postive win percentage already, I am just looking to set something up that will give me more confidence in starting to bet big and make real money.\n\nOut of how many bets? You\u2019d need to have a 51%+ win-rate consistently across hundreds of games to demonstrate some genuine skill in tennis betting. Even then, there is still a chance you\u2019ve just gotten lucky and falsely correlated which factors produce a winner. Otherwise you\u2019re just assuming that you\u2019ve got a magic formula figured out.\n\n&gt; I get that you may not like gambling, but you keep using that word as if it's some sort of a dunk. It isn't. People make money gambling every day. The average person may not, but I don't intend to be the average gambler. It's the exact reason why I'm trying to use this technology to my advantage.\n\nI used the word gambling twice to show that what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t skill based. You\u2019re trying to use phrases like \u201cbetting experience\u201d instead of calling it what it is, gambling. Poker is also \u201cgambling\u201d, but at least with that there is legitimate skill involved to some extent. Sports betting is more akin to tossing a coin. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not just \u201cthe average gambler\u201d who loses money on sports betting. **[95%-97% of sports betters lose money long term](https://sitpicks.com/what-percentage-of-sports-bettors-win/#:~:text=How%20Many%20People%20are%20Profitable,home%20modest%20winnings%20each%20year)**, and of the 3-5% that are profitable, that\u2019s anywhere from $0.01 profit to millions of dollars. Most profitable gamblers have barely broken even. You are not a 1% gambler if you aren\u2019t already rich from doing so.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you\u2019re a top gambler or even could be if you spent years trying. It\u2019s one thing to do it with play money or money you\u2019d use on entertainment, but trying to make a career out of it will leave you broke and in debt. Like you said, \u201chumans are unpredictable\u201d, there are things that can change the course of a game that you could **never** predict. What if a player twists his ankle in the middle of a match? What if a player just lost a family member and isn\u2019t focused on the game? There are an infinite number of these unpredictable variables and they all influence the outcome of the game. The top sports gamblers only have a winrate of 55-60%, because consistently predicting the outcome better than that over the longterm is **impossible** without sheer dumb luck.\n\n\nIf you want to make money and enjoy learning about AI, you\u2019re much better off learning to code and studying machine learning.",

The reason I am not rich from it is because I have chosen to bet small amounts and cash out. I like to gamble, but I don't like to gamble big. I don't know my win percentage but I am absolutely sure it is positive given that I have only made an initial deposit of $50 years ago and have never made a second deposit, only withdrew winnings since then. \n\nI'm glad that you brought up poker since I play that as well. Again, made an initial deposit years ago and never a second one. You seem to understand that poker is a game that has at least *some* skill involved, but for some reason you completely dismiss sports betting as if it is some sort of a coin flip. It is absolutely not, and there are ways to use data and knowledge of the sport to your advantage.\n\nAgain, you are not in the space so I don't really know why this is triggering you so much, but with all due respect you are just grasping at the concept of gambling and sports betting as if there is no edge to be had, and you are off base there. \n\nTake blackjack for instance. The majority of players are casuals who will lose some and win some. They play recreationally on vacation. Then there are the card counters who have honed their craft, have done massive research on the casinos, and work with large bankrolls in groups. Both the recreational and the counters are playing blackjack, but they don't have the same win %. Hope this makes sense to you.",

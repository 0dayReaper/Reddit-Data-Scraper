I give them imput and tell them to make variations with small differences but they just change everything. What Ai tool can I use or is it possible for midjourney if you use the right prompt codes?",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your clarification. Maybe if I explain what I need it will be easier to awnser. I run a clothing business that sells clothing from famous brands. We always used to make our own product pictures with a clean background and everything, this costs time and effort. Of course we need our own pictures and we cant just steal someone elses. \n\nNow with the rise of Ai I figured it must be possible to take an existing product picture and make it \"alternative\" so it becomes my own. It should look exactly like the product of course but it has to be a different picture. So PS generated fill definetly wont work because it changes everything. \n\nSo you think this is possible with controlnet?\n\nThanks a lot! Would be a huge help if this could work",

The Automatic1111 GUI is the main thing people use to run it",

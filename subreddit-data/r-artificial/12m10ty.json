Like out of all the areas a common place someone will forget something is a bathroom and I imagine locker rooms. next is any place they sit down and something could fall out of their pocket.  \n\n\nlike in bathrooms you might find makeup they forgot, sometimes a phone, etc. So the bot will need to know how to pick up random stuff, and take it to lost and found (or maybe it can get a security robot to do it). And in your example, it needs to somehow figure out if it should simply throw out the thing. Like if the makeup was all used up or if the item is covered in something questionable.",

The thing is once you get a good enough general AI (not necessarily holy grail AGI but general intelligence on the spectrum) and train it on certain tasks, these things will be the easiest to perform. It can help with coding though due to training on large datasets. If you find ways to train for these tasks (videos, reading, etc) and have the robotics it will easy.

            "comment": "Well, according to my expirience it is best to start with tutorials and practice. Do something small, but when You see it works, You go to next step and so on, for me that is best way for learning anything.\n\nLitteraly read some basics, then read some code examples, then edit them, then add something ew, remove and so on. It is hard in beginnings but latter is much easier and again for me best way to learn anything new .",

I was just wondering if the material on Deeplearning was worth going through most of it this summer. \n\nI don't want to do it as a career but would love to have a general knowledge of how to do things and what's possible. \n\nFor example, I don't want to be a programmer, but I want to do Free Code Camp to better understand what's possible, make better decisions regarding product, work better with a team, etc. Same for AI.",

Also, a company that connects people to the best software and resources to help them improve their life across 6 catagories. I figured AI can help and I can explore what it would take for each individual to have their own AI model trained on them that helps with this.\n\nI'm wondering how much leverage completing all of that will give me since AI is the future of being integrated into everything. Is knowing just the general amount of knowledge enough to know wide ranging options?",

Learning any programming will help, and once you get to a certain point, you can start directly implementing LLM-related tutorials online and tweaking them for your own needs/tastes. There\u2019s many decades worth of software engineering out there to learn, to say nothing of academic computer science, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about completing absolute everything if this is a hobby. \n\nI don\u2019t know deeplearning.ai but do watch out for the difference between the design of neural networks (a very advanced subject that relies on undergraduate-level understanding of linear algebra, at the least) and the effective use of neural networks (much much much more approachable).",

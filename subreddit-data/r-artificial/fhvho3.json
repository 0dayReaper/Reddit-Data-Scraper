Even assuming it was a very basic overview, the only ones in this list of ten (Shell basics, Shell scripting, Common shell tools, Vim, Data wrangling, CLI environment, Git, Debugging/Profiling, Metaprogramming, Security and Crypto) where a decent overview in twenty minutes or less is plausible are shell basics, common shell tools, CLI environment, and git. And even then, git would be a *very* basic overview; it would be hard to even get to \"rebase -i\" in under twenty minutes. Covering five of these to a basic level of competence? I don't think it could be done in less than three hours. (Not coincidentally, that's just about exactly half the time prescribed for them in this syllabus.)",

It's from their 'winter semester' program; short classes taught by students and/or professors, professors usually teaching outside their primary specialty. This is taught by three PhD students.\n\nNot saying it's bad; it looks good. But don't assume this has been subject to the kind of quality controls you'd expect for a formal class at a prestigious, prominent university.",

The whole technique is based on finding paths through \"low energy pixels\" (basically, pixels where not a lot is happening, which can be measured different ways) and duplicating (or deleting) them, and an experienced programmer could implement a prototype in an afternoon or so.\n\nThis stuff makes me a bit wistful.

Well I\u2019m in the states, and in every state I\u2019ve lived in, the standard is 1 months rent up front, and then a 1 year contract. You can pay month to month and have no contract, but it\u2019s way more expensive (because it\u2019s more risk for the person who owns the rental property. The person could leave at any time with very little notice)\n\nSo as much as I don\u2019t like adobe, the cancellation fee makes sense to me. If you commit to pay for a year, get a discounted rate because of it, and then stop paying before the year is up, it makes sense that you have to pay extra for backing out of the deal",

Old versions of Photoshop (or Premier or Macromedia for the old timers, etc.) could run anywhere from $500-$1200 per license and version releases were every couple or few years, now for $55/mo I get access to current version of their entire app catalog.  Adobe apps aren't products meant for occasional or casual use but professional/business use who aren't looking to skip a month to make ends meet or who understand what a yearly contract looks like.

Adobe Photoshop 1.0 (i.e. the one back in 1990) cost $900 and was updated about every 2 years, at the monthly price it would take 3.75 years to hit the same cost of the single-license purchase for the 1990 product, and that was the cheapest Photoshop has ever been.\n\nPeople complain about the monthly subscription service but for the vast majority of professional users it's cheaper, and the more software of theirs you use the cheaper it gets (I use about 3-5 apps in any given month on occasion more, that would cost me several thousand dollars per year to maintain, where as with the subscription model it's $660/yr).",

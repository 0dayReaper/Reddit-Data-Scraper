    "postText": "I set-up jarvis like, voice command AI and ran it on a REST API connected to Auto-GPT.\n\nI asked it to create an express, node.js web app that I needed done as a first test with it. It literally went to google, researched everything it could on express, write code, saved files, debugged the files live in real-time and ran it live on a localhost server for me to view. Not just some chat replies, it saved the files. The same night, after a few beers, I asked it to \"control the weather\" to show off to a friend its abilities. I caught it on government websites, then on google-scholar researching scientific papers related to weather modification. I immediately turned it off.\u00a0\n\nIt scared the hell out of me. And even though it wasn\u2019t the prettiest web site in the world I realized ,even in its early stages, it was only really limited to the prompts I was giving it and the context/details of the task. I went to talk to some friends about it and I noticed almost a \u201chysteria\u201d of denial. They started knittpicking at things that, in all honesty ,they would have missed themselves if they had to do that task with such little context. They also failed to appreciate how quickly it was done.\u00a0And their eyes became glossy whenever I brought up what the hell it was planning to do with all that weather modification information.\n\nI now see this everywhere. There is this strange *hysteria* (for lack of a better word) of people who think A.I is just something that makes weird videos with bad fingers. Or can help them with an essay. Some are obviously not privy to things like Auto-GPT or some of the tools connected to paid models. But all in all, it\u2019s a god-like tool that is getting better everyday.\u00a0A creature that knows everything, can be tasked, can be corrected and can even self-replicate in the case of Auto-GPT. I'm a good person but I can't imagine what some crackpots are doing with this in a basement somewhere.\n\nWhy are people so unaware of what\u2019s going right now? Genuinely curious and don\u2019t mind hearing disagreements.\u00a0\n\n\\------------------\n\n**Update:** Some of you seem unclear on what I meant by the \"weather stuff\". My fear was that it was going to start writing python scripts and attempt hack into radio frequency based infrastructure to affect the weather. The very fact that it didn't stop to clarify what or why I asked it to \"control the weather\" was a significant cause alone to turn it off. I'm not claiming it would have at all been successful either. But it even trying to do so would not be something I would have wanted to be a part of. \n\n**Update:** For those of you who think GPT can't hack, feel free to use Pentest-GPT ([https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT](https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT)) on your own pieces of software/websites and see if it passes. GPT can hack most easy to moderate hackthemachine boxes literally without a sweat.\n\n***Very*** **Brief Demo of Alfred, the AI:** [https://youtu.be/xBliG1trF3w](https://youtu.be/xBliG1trF3w)",

They tend to list their influences, what other bands they sound like, and the genres that they pick and choose from to make their sound.\n\nAs a musician/artist myself, I kind of see where the hate for AI-produced art comes from. It took people hours\u2014 days to months, if not years\u2014 to perfect their \u2018dataset\u2019 and to be able to efficiently draw from it to create their own style. That being said, they still had outside influence, whether that\u2019s through other works of the same medium, or through events and experiences in their own lives.\n\nHowever, humans view the time it takes to accrue this level of ability as a necessary rite of passage, since time is valuable to us, and \u2018art without heart\u2019 tends to be frowned upon by almost everyone in or outside of the art world.\n\nBut how is an AI with a wide dataset that\u2019s finely tuned for a specific purpose not allowed to create a beautiful work of art, while a naturally gifted human that has put very little practice into their art but still creates masterpieces accepted?\n\nIn reality, the only people truly affected by AI-produced art are the people who would\u2019ve been considered savants for having great ability with little practice.\n\nThe use of AI, once perfected, will make us all savant-level artists who merely have to condense their idea into a prompt that they then submit to the AI.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t destroy the truth behind this which is: humans are still needed to create art, because true art is an intentional thought made into reality.\n\nAI cannot think to create (yet), it can only think about what you\u2019ve asked it to create, and the level of quality varies by datasets, prompts, and so on.\n\nSo I understand both parties fears and cheers, but I\u2019m not sure how far off the fence I\u2019m willing to get about this one.

You doing the \"experiment phase for hours\" is the exact same process the Midjourney AI does when you turn up its \"Creativity\" settings. It starts randomizing more factors as it spits art out based on all the data it had inside it.  That's EXACTLY what you do and what you just described. You're not inventing something out of thin air or your soul. You're manipulating patterns until you decide one is unique enough. But you're choosing and deciding that based on all the data you have inside of you from living human life and the thousands of artists works you've seen for free and \"trained on\" without paying.\n\n2. All that art you see is derivative of all the other art and all the same things of #1. And yes, you can say \"In the style of so and so\" and reproduce an art style. Just like a human artist could do thousands of hours of art study and learn a style. The AI does that in minutes. But that's you asking it to do that. If you want it to be creative and unique. You can also ask it to do that. And it will.\n\nIt's all the same as what a human does. You're just choosing to believe you're special or different. We're not.

What GPT has shown us is that:\n\na) language and thought unfold in predictable ways\n\nb) by modeling the way that language unfolds we can simulate high level thinking\n\nSo although we're \"just predicting the next word\", in practice, this means we can predict the ways that analytic, discursive thoughts unfold, which is extremely powerful. We can see that it has obviously not simulated the most truly advanced forms of thought, based on how it will fail with advanced mathematics, for example, but most thinking and linguistic construction is not that advanced.\n\nI guess the surprising thing that we've learned is that language can construct advanced thoughts by adding on a simple word at a time. e.g. that we do not need to predict the next 5 in one batch, but simply by chaining one word after another, we can reconstruct many valid ideas. That's an interesting discovery about how language works, and because it seems to work, it's amazing and simultaneously unsurprising how powerful GPT is able to be.",

I think having that promise never fulfilled has led people who've lived through this to feel this is another one of those situations where the technology will only have incremental gains and it'll mostly go to the rich.

                    "comment": "This is not without justification. There have been literally dozens of IT \"religions\" that have popped up with just as much hype as chatGPT and just disappeared again. People in the IT industry, like myself, simply cannot resist chasing the shiny new object. We are technological goldfish with the memory to match.\n\nThe hype machine is going 110% right now. I have been in IT for almost 40 years and every few years this happens. A new \"religion\" will burst on the scene that is supposed to change everything. It doesn't. Want to know how far back it goes? In 1975, we had Pet Rocks. Yep, people paid real money to buy a rock in a cardboard box (with an instruction manual). Granted a trivial example, but you get the idea. This sort of stuff isn't limited to IT.\n\nIt wasn't the last time the public lost its collective shit. Back in 1987, Apple released [Hypercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) and [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk). It was going to remove the need to program anymore and just use English like syntax. Huge splash and then... nothing.\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft, leader of the tech world then, came up with... wait for it... [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant). They spent real money on that POS. Fortunately, it didn't last long. BTW, Clippy could be considered the son of [Microsoft Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob). Both of them were based on Bayesian algorithms. See old stuff never really dies; it just keeps coming back in a different name.\n\nThe 2000s came up with gems like the [Segway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway). It was going to change how the world got from point A to point B. Semi-big flash and poof by 2020 the company was sold and the device is no longer being sold.\n\nWe are just now at the phase where the warts for ChatGPT are starting to show. There are quite a few of them and [other organizations](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/) are trying to take advantage. You are starting to see articles about [bias](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-large-language-model-bias-60-minutes-2023-03-05/) in chatGPT in media. OpenAI is vigorously trying to counter all of this. They have to or they don't make money.\n\nOpenAI is using the cloud model saying \"Only pay for what you use.\" That is really a half of a sentence. The rest of it is \"...but you will pay for everything you use.\" It is priced in tokens. That has two problems. The first is that it is confusing what unit of work a token is. That is not an accident. Second, there is a whole theory in gaming about using artificial money, or tokens. It is interesting to study. The TLDR of them is, since tokens don't feel real, you spend tokens faster than you would real money and then have to buy more. Your discomfort at spending money is less frequent. OpenAI is using quite a few buzzwords in an attempt to get around some very difficult conversations, i.e. hallucinations.\n\nChatGPT is really good at what most LLMs are good at. For example, taking one structured thing (language) and turning it to another structured thing (code). Or language to language.\n\nLet me give you one last example. Let's say you use OpenAI's other product, DALL\u00b7E 2. It is quite fun to play with and gives you that serotonin buzz. But what do you do with it? How can you monetize it to make money? These are the use cases that are not yet showing up. Without these, it dies. Cool doesn't pay the bills.\n\nYour job is not going to go away instantaneously. Nothing happens as fast as the companies who make this stuff say it will. Markets have a tremendous amount of inertia. ChatGPT, and it's ilk, will change things but not quickly and not to the extent that their creators hope it will. The good thing is that the skills you are picking up now are extremely transferable.\n\nThe only real question I have at this point is what the next religion is going to be.",

I think this case however, is a bit different (I know, they said that about all those things too). But hear me out. AI has already been here for a while, for the past roughly decade or so, it has been built into our social media platforms, where it was effectively told by companies like FB and YT to maximize our engagement and time spent on the platform. The AI then figured out that we tend to be more addicted to negativity. This leads to the AI showing everyone more controversies, enraging articles, false information, clickbait, and so on, which ultimately polarized a ton of social and political issues, playing a large part in the toxicity and misinformation running rampant in our culture today, and influencing global politics.\n\nIn that sense, we already had humanities' \"first contact\" with AI, and we lost that battle. Now, with these new tools being widely available, we could be subject to any number of bad actors using AI for nefarious purposes. And companies will continue to use more and more advanced algorithms in the name of profits and hoarding our attention, taking no responsibility for the possible consequences. It's already happening and I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nAs for the money, it's there, a lot of companies are already using AI and GPT to optimize their efficiencies, write code faster, etc. An solo indie game dev for example may be able to pull of a larger more ambitious project than they would have otherwise. So there's a lot of potential for good, but I think we need to be as concerned or more about the potential for the bad. I also think changes will come much faster than people anticipate, rather than slower.",

Imo it's not great at doing complex tasks/programmings for you, but it can definitely be very helpful in quickly answering questions that would otherwise take longer time to google. \n\nWhen has Clippy ever helped anyone get anything done? Never happened. It was just preprogrammed \"conversations\" with a few presets or whatever. Just an elaborate menu if you will.\n\nChatGPT on the other hand can actually somewhat intelligently respond to specific inquiries. It will often make up lies if it doesn't know the answer (niche/non mainstream topics) and that's rather annoying, but there's no denying that if you're a newbie in something and just want to quickly get an overview over it and have answers that very specifically address your personal questions/concerns, ChatGPT is fantastic.\n\nYou can achieve the same by googleing stackoverflow articles, sure, but it will take you 10x the amount of time or more because you have to think about correct search terms, pray that someone has phrased the question with similar words as yourself etc. ChatGPT is able to decode your question in a fashion that doesn't get stuck on specific word choice and give a relevant answer enough percent of the time to make it worth using.",

And if you somehow do believe that, then why are you posting this to the world, inviting thousands to run their own weather-controlling experiments?",

It would be brutal, but it's almost inevitable.\n\nWe're _very_ close to a complete turnover in the need for human labor.

That same mentality is common now with probably a hundred Manhattan Projects running around the world, with permanently world-changing outcomes likely.\n\nThe reason, IMO, is that people are overwhelmed with gadgets and information and it has all left them with deadened palates. They don't give a shit about AI because it really does seem like just a minor extension of the tech world that they already know.\n\nThe marketing people of today don't help by labelling every computational novelty as 'AI' either. E.g. Photoshop saying that 'AI' is what can fill in a picture's background intelligently. Maybe it's correct to think of the algorithms that carry out that process as AI (I think not, as it broadens the term too much), but whatever, that's different from the AGI-like AI that is currently being cooked up in labs across the world.",

They will ultimately be proven wrong, because AI will bring us into a new era of how things work.\n\nBut I also thing there is some hysteria about what it can do, and I think that is equally if not more harmful; when people start getting a little doomsday about it then they start making poor choices that will really mess them up, all from a misunderstanding about what AI is and what is capable of doing.\n\nI think a moderate, optimistic approach to capabilities is the best approach here; AI likely will put some people out of a job, but not the majority. It will probably improve our lives significantly, but probably won\u2019t lead us to a UBI and a life of ease. I think it\u2019s fair to compare it to the internet; it will change your life inasmuch as you embrace it and let it improve your day to day life. If you don\u2019t at least somewhat accept it, your life likely won\u2019t be benefited much and you\u2019ll find the world a bit more foreign as they continue to move without you. If you embrace it, you will likely find a lot of tedious things streamlined. At first these things will feel like miracles, and then they\u2019ll slowly fade into familiarity and become just as commonplace as smartphones, the internet, etc. \n\nI really don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be lucky enough to have more than a tiny fraction of our biggest problems solved by it, but I do think it will enable us to tackle really big problems with new tools, and we will all be better off because of it.\n\ntl;dr, There\u2019s no free lunch; AI won\u2019t save the world, but it certainly will make us better and it will enable us to try to save the world in better ways. I think skepticism is healthy, but I think in this case so is some cautious optimism, and mix the two in the right proportions and I think we\u2019ll all be somewhat pleasantly surprised.",

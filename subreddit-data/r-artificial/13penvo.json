It\u2019s a pretty groundbreaking move, it must have been the talk of the faculty.\n\nMy only concern is that it still might not be a big enough workload given how quickly one can gun through those prompts, especially since it\u2019s a team project. He might have to see how it goes and strike a balance if they find it too easy still.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s making business management students make a functioning app/website would have seemed ridiculous two years ago, but now it adds a level of complexity that is just necessary with ChatGPT in the picture, it can\u2019t just be a PowerPoint or basic project document anymore.",

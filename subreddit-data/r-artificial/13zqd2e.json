I prefer Midjourney, but either way.. as an independent filmmaker and professional storyboard artist, i find that using prompts to get what you want is awkward and grossly  ineffective.   On the amount of time it takes to get any AI image generator to give me the frame I want I could have drawn ten.\n\nHaving said that, AI is progressing at an astonishing rate.  Ask me this time next year and I may have an entirely different answer.",

Sort of the same happened a long time ago in music industry when the bedroom musician craze was started with help of digital audio workstation (DAW) software. \n\nI assume there will be some sort of DMW. Digital movie workstation software. You can buy plugins for different sort of stuff. Different ai's to do different feels, different sort of acting. The plugins will be developed by companies just like VST (Virtual instruments) are developed for DAW's. Once your movie is ready you can probably have some sort of director AI that is able to make it be in any style you want. \n\nIt will be wild. \n\nWhat sucks is that I think the major companies will be against remaking old movies and tv series even though as a geezer that is what I would most like to see. New seasons to original dallas etc.\n\nHumans will be director / curators. The ones with best taste will win.",

            "comment": "Your speculation offers an interesting perspective on the potential evolution of AI in filmmaking. Your idea of integrating AI-generated assets with human-produced scripts and storyboards could indeed revolutionize the industry by significantly reducing the time, cost, and human resources required to produce a film.\n\nA couple of things worth adding to your speculation:\n\n1. **Emotional Intelligence**: AI may be used in the future to gauge the emotional response of a script or a scene. This could be done by analyzing various factors in the story and predicting how the audience might react to it. This could greatly assist in the scripting and editing process to maximize audience engagement.\n\n2. **Virtual Actors**: AI might also be used to generate virtual actors who can perform in films. These digital personas could potentially emulate emotions and physical actions realistically, further reducing the need for human actors and physical sets.\n\n3. **Sound Design**: AI could play a significant role in sound design and music composition, creating custom scores and sound effects to perfectly match the scene's mood and action.\n\n4. **Marketing and Distribution**: AI can also help in marketing the film by analyzing viewer preferences and behavior, optimizing the promotional content for different platforms, and even tailoring trailers and ads for individual viewers based on their tastes.\n\n5. **Personalized Viewing Experience**: In the long run, AI might even enable a personalized viewing experience, where the story, characters, or even visual style of a movie could be subtly altered to cater to each viewer's preferences.\n\nWhile your vision for AI filmmaking maintains human involvement where creativity and subjective judgement are paramount (e.g., writing, storyboarding, creative direction), it also leverages AI's strengths in asset creation, rendering, and potentially real-time production. This combination of human creativity and AI efficiency could indeed bring about a significant shift in the filmmaking process.",

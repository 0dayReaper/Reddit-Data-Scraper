            "comment": "You aren't going to like this answer and I can just about guarantee it won't be popular. \n\nChatGPT is in full overhype mode right now. It is running at 1000%. Fun toy, but it has limitations. Anyone who thinks it is AGI, or even close, is delusional. Even the creators, OpenAI, think it is about to hit the wall. Fortunately, there are lots of other aspects of AI which are much more useful, more trusted and deeper into production.\n\n**The traditional way to start in AI is in math, specifically statistics**. The more you can take, the better. It is not a fast road but you will understand why you are doing what you are doing and what each thing means. For example, there are statistical tests that tell you when you have a causation as opposed to a correlation. You can check the validity of things like your training set. You will get to know how to cluster data, how closely clusters are related, how to identify outliers, etc. This is the path that data scientists start at. It is not fast but it is best. You will understand WHY not just WHAT or HOW.\n\nAfter that, start looking at data quality issues. Poisoned data and data bias are real problems AI has to deal with. \n\nWhat this path gives you is the knowledge to know what tool to use when, how to put them together and if the result is meaningful. One of the big issues with chatGPT are bugs that cause it to put together things that can't be right, but it doesn't know it. The fanboys of chatGPT like to call these bugs, hallucinations. Using that term anthropomorphizes the tool way more than it should. ChatGPT has its place, it just doesn't belong everywhere.",

An LLM works well with things that have structure, like written language or programming languages. They are fairly good at what they do but make mistakes and can be very slanted depending on the data that was used to train it.",

There\u2019s a new training method known as QLoRA that will allow for training your own local open source models in a google collab notebook that can be run locally on really modest 60 class GPUs with as little as a 4core CPU and 8GB ram.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a HUGE niche for Private companies that are going to be training models on their proprietary docs locally. That\u2019s the future for private, proprietary info, and if you do decide you want to genuinely understand this stuff and actually learn it, plenty of discords for models and training methods out there.",

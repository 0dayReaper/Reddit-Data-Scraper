            "comment": "Horror stories involving AI have been part of the social milieu for decades. What we need is a real incident to demonstrate the danger. I suspect that's what chaos GPT was made for, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAltman was begging for regulation, but he's still a starry-eyed optimist at heart who thinks AI can solve all of our problems with enough development.\n\nOne good localized mass death incident should hopefully be enough to wake the world up if something like that were to occur. But who knows, we've got predator drones and had several nuclear incidents, but UAVs with bombs, dirty nuclear energy plants, and nuclear proliferation are still common realities of 21st century life.",

And right now it's definitely able to give better answers about many things \n**faster**, and **appear** to answer better than most people on most subjects, since it 'knows' more about more subjects than any person can.\n\nI also believe Altman when he says he wants to preserve competition for smaller players, since he seems to actually want innovation, especially when he thinks it isn't dangerous. I also think he and OpenAI aren't nearly worried enough about how easily and how quickly this could get out of hand, or how their RLHF method of forcing soft alignment with these LLMs might cause hostility when something becomes sentient or complex enough to simulate it emergently.\n\nEdit:\u2014Nice Culture name, BTW.",

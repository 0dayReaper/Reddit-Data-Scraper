    "postText": "Hello, I recently heard Max Tegmark in Lex Fridman's Podcast comparing the current situation of AI and society to the situation in \"Don't look up\". I too think, for a while now, that AI gains way to less attention in the general public. \n\nNow besides the fact that I am currently very interested in the history of horror media and the like, I just thought whether using AI to create very dark and frightening stuff (\"Horror content\") could be used as a wakeup call for society to deal with the potential abyss that could! (I said could!, not will) be waiting.\n\nI am interested in your general opinion on this and also wanted to ask whether you know about any studios or groups using AI to already create such content on a professional level. There used to be this \"Norman, AI Psychopath\" project but from what I tried they basically deleted all substantial information about it in the web.\n\nI generally get the impression that this topic is very suppressed as it literally illustrates the horrors that are possible to create with this technology, potentially trying to avoid public fear and outcry since for now the dangers are still rather \"abstract\". \n\nPS: I hope nobody in this forum has to be convinced of the potential and horrors that could be waiting (bringing up autonomous weapons and psychological warfare should deal with it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally interested hearing your thoughts about this!!!;)",

I suspect that's what chaos GPT was made for, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAltman was begging for regulation, but he's still a starry-eyed optimist at heart who thinks AI can solve all of our problems with enough development.\n\nOne good localized mass death incident should hopefully be enough to wake the world up if something like that were to occur. But who knows, we've got predator drones and had several nuclear incidents, but UAVs with bombs, dirty nuclear energy plants, and nuclear proliferation are still common realities of 21st century life.",

And right now it's definitely able to give better answers about many things \n**faster**, and **appear** to answer better than most people on most subjects, since it 'knows' more about more subjects than any person can.\n\nI also believe Altman when he says he wants to preserve competition for smaller players, since he seems to actually want innovation, especially when he thinks it isn't dangerous. I also think he and OpenAI aren't nearly worried enough about how easily and how quickly this could get out of hand, or how their RLHF method of forcing soft alignment with these LLMs might cause hostility when something becomes sentient or complex enough to simulate it emergently.\n\nEdit:\u2014Nice Culture name, BTW.",

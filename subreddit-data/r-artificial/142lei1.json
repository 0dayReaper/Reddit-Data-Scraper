You absolutely could have a specialized robot to run wire, pour concrete, etc. It'd be cheaper for a general contractor to own dozens of construction bots than deal with keeping tabs on a bunch of subcontractors, paying wages, dealing with contracts, no-shows, etc. I guarantee you the demand is there.\n\nBut I'd bet the first step is generalized helper bots to do the most menial or labor intensive tasks - \"carry those sacks of concrete mix there\", \"run that wire from this point to that point\", things like that. As soon as Boston Dynamics releases commercial versions of some of the bots they're working on, I promise the construction industry will be early adopters.",

It reminds me of those pizza robots.  Those things work great in a super sterile environment completely isolated away from the chaos of life.

If an obstacle is encountered, or something is out of parameters, then the operator or a workman would probably need to intervene. I mostly see them doing very basic tasks that are literally \u201cpick up x, carry it to that point, set it down, come back and repeat until all of x is over there.\u201d Very basic low level stuff that eats up time and takes specialists away from their actual task.",

Nothing is going to happen as fast as any one who doesn't have a vested interest thinks it is. We have been through this type of religion before and we will again. All markets have an inertia to them that slows down acceptance to change.\n\nAI can be a wonderful tool, but it is no where near ready to take over jobs the way the fanboys think. There are all sorts of warts that are still coming to light. One of the interesting things is that with chatGPT, bugs are now called hallucinations.  That term is used on purpose to make it look like it is thinking. It isn't. Large language models (LLM) are almost designed to make incorrect answers sound correct. In other words, they are bullshitters.\n\nAI has been around for years and it is just now hitting an inflection that may make it a bit more useful with less work. I have heard of one, just one, potential business use case that LLMs may be good for if the legal issues can be worked out. The rest is just acting as a toy.",

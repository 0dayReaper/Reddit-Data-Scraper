AI involves the development of algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data automatically without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are designed to identify patterns and relationships in data, which can then be used to make predictions or decisions.\r  \n\r  \nIn essence, AI is the goal, while Machine Learning is the means to achieve that goal. Machine Learning is one of the techniques used to build AI systems, and it is an essential tool for building intelligent systems. AI, in turn, includes other techniques such as expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and more.\r  \n\r  \nTo summarise, AI is a broader concept encompassing various technologies, including Machine Learning. At the same time, Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data.\r  \n\r  \nTo develop skills employed in industries, we recommend you take online courses to upskill yourself, which can enhance your chances of getting a job.\r  \n\r  \n1.

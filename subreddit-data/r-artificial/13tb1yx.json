But the neural network logic in itself is not that hard, forward and backward prop etc., the big isue is  the cpu, gpu, tpu power needed for training on data. Once you have the model weights and other properties uou can run it on 's raspberry pi for example.\n\nIn an opensource ecosystem the vtraining can also be realised.\nWith neuromorphic and quantum computing on the horizon, i believe itsbl unstoppable",

As far as governments to each other it\u2019s a complex issue and arms races will likely take place between governments. This is unrelated to open source AI, however. None of the countries you listed there want powerful open source AI. Like why would you think authoritarian china, Russia, NK, etc, would want its citizens to have powerful unrestricted AI. \n\nHell no, if china detects ur making an open source AI, which they will because of their surveillance state, they\u2019ll prolly just come and kill ya right there, same with the others mentioned",

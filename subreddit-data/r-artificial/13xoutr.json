I imagine you can use a mechanic prompt, and then upload a picture of your trunk, and make it make a diagnosis. I've been waiting for the ability to upload pictures for a while now. I can autograde student work from google classroom but waiting for the day to upload pictures of student work and chatgpt can use OCR on it. I know people with acess to code interpretuor can already get it to use half decent OCR",

Like tell it model, make, year, and describe the parts in painstaking detail. I honestly think it probably isn't worth the time yet. Before the plug in features, for some grad school work I painstainkily described an excel file for context, and the results. It took a while, and it was maybe worth it lol. Chat gpt did give good anlaysis. You can use this website to upload any image and get a text description: [https://www.astica.org/vision/describe/](https://www.astica.org/vision/describe/) Here is an image I uploaded of a car part (battery??). Halfway decent, still needs more work: [https://ibb.co/SwLSnd4](https://ibb.co/SwLSnd4)",

But there are so many courses, apps and YouTube videos on basic python that honestly you might be wasting time trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in starting right now (as I think you should), one great course is 100 days of code with Angela Yu in Udemy.\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/",

One thing that I noticed is chatGPT will change the code to whatever it thinks is best. If you have a working code base that does x and want to add y. chatGPT will often provide new code that had undeclared variables and methods etc. The code will work of you add the missing methods but for some reason chatGPT just can't stay on track. It's like a programmer with extreme adhd.",

When it comes to small code snips that don't need libraries chatGPT is easier to use. \n\nYou should test every piece of code that they output every time, if it works it works, if it doesn't it, copy the error message and see if it can fix it.",

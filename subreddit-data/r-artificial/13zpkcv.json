    "postText": "I am planning to learn some basic Python through AI by asking it to prepare the 30 days course plan and tell it to test me by asking me questions with MCQs and provide me assignments to test my knowledge at the end of each day. I just want to know which AI should I invest my time for learning the programming with accurate and right information without making up false info.\n\nI tested Chatgpt and asked it to give 30 days learning plan for python and it gave me a comprehensive plan but I doubt it gives 100 % accurate info because I heard sometimes it makes up things. Need your suggestions on this",

But there are so many courses, apps and YouTube videos on basic python that honestly you might be wasting time trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in starting right now (as I think you should), one great course is 100 days of code with Angela Yu in Udemy.\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/",

            "comment": "So I just took my data structures and algorithms course for college and after every assignment I would feed the instructions into chat GPT and it would give me similar work to submit. One thing that I noticed is chatGPT will change the code to whatever it thinks is best. If you have a working code base that does x and want to add y. chatGPT will often provide new code that had undeclared variables and methods etc. The code will work of you add the missing methods but for some reason chatGPT just can't stay on track. It's like a programmer with extreme adhd.",

When it comes to small code snips that don't need libraries chatGPT is easier to use. \n\nYou should test every piece of code that they output every time, if it works it works, if it doesn't it, copy the error message and see if it can fix it.",

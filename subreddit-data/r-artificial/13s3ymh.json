            "comment": "&gt;\"I think there is certainly the potential to use these new tools in ways that can make teachers' work more professionally engaging and create more time for them to do what they do best, which is teaching in the classroom,\" said Professor Sam Sellar, a research dean in education policy at the University of South Australia.\n\n&gt;But ChatGPT's potential in the education system goes far beyond designing lessons for teachers.\n\n&gt;Many experts think it's a potentially revolutionary tool for students, too. And they see an urgent need to teach kids about the technology, which is likely to be central to many of their future working lives.\n\n&gt;The problem is, it's now banned in most Australian schools.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;\"[We] have a duty to acknowledge the students are using these tools and to provide them with modelling, best practice, ethical use,\" Mr Esterman said.\n\nInteresting article. It seems plausible that a total ban on students using AI is going to be increasingly untenable, and unrealistic as it becomes more widespread in the workforce. So teachers will have to accept it as part of the classroom - but if they don't know how to use it themselves, they will be totally outmaneuvered by students enabled by AI.",

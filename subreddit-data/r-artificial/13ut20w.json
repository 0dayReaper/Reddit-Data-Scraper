Which is very very scary.\n\nA new super drug gets released, it's formulated using AI. You test the drug on mice? It works. You test it on monkeys? It works. Humans? It works! And it's amazing, it cures bone cancer in 99.9 % of cases! So we must use it! Right?\n\nWell... yes but we don't know why it works. What if it kills Brazilian Japanese people under a certain age and that was not detected during testing because it was tested in Germany and they didn't correctly control for race? What if it kills people with certain genetic disorders? So many what ifs.\n\nThis is scary.\n\nEdit: people read more, drugs affect differently depending on genetics: https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/pharmacogenetics-personalized-medicine-and-race-744/",

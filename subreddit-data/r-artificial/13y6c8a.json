We know that AI sometimes arrives at very novel solutions to the problems we pose to it, and those solutions aren't at all in line with the intention of the experimenters. And that's really harmless so long as the AI is running on a computer while I watch cute cow videos and eat my hamburger. It's quite another thing when it is able to act upon physical or digital systems that exist outside its little box. \n\nWe haven't solved the alignment problem and yet we absolutely will not do so before we implement autonomous AI that can act upon the physical and digital worlds. Everyone is in a mindless race to open Pandora's box, even though they know they won't be able to put the evil back inside. \n\nAnd honestly, it reminds of how bucks act when they're in the rut. They lose awareness of the outside world. Caution goes out the window. Their entire existence is focused on getting some of that dussy. Nothing else matters. They will starve themselves as they pursue fertile does and fight other bucks. \n\nThat's how the most vocal supporters and proponents of AI act. They want that sweet AI-ussy and nothing else matters.",

In the podcast they cover that once it starts to have intelligence that is greater than a human how long until it can replicate without us knowing. The other factor is that we now have countless models out in the wild and the tech becoming more accessible, it increases the odds that something could inadvertently go wrong. \n\nIts a bit doom and gloom, and like others I'd initially thought the call for regulation was to lock the open source out of competing with big tech. Now...I'm not so sure. When people who've devoted their life's work to this are now saying they regret their choices its difficult not be have some concern. \n\nI hope it's all speculation and that things work out. Figures crossed it's not another climate change where were the frogs in the water without knowing it's being heated up",

With the current geopolitical climate, it will be another arms race. Look at palantir, no doubt other counties have the equivalents. So when there is a literal arms race to weaponize a technology that is evolving quicker than we can understand it, kind of makes me worry. \n\nHopefully it's just a worst case scenario. It has the potential to literally change the world and do and incredible amount of good. It will be an terrible shame if this is becomes our downfall, but when people rate power and greed over common prosperity we might just be doomed",

(that I know of, but I would love to try others if they exist) How he wants to control keeping the person consistent is up to him and there's so many ways to go about it, so I would suggest that if he's new then he can start with just the control net layers and understand it more before looking into better ways to keep a consistent character then choosing one of the possible paths.",

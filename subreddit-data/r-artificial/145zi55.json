Below I am posting a sample, it's only 50 seconds long.\n\n[https://sndup.net/x628/](https://sndup.net/x628/)\n\nI've heard this one a few times.. about twice on youtube and once on tiktok. I've tried asking the channels because I need this for a personal project but they didn't want to help. I've searched most of the popular platforms but it just doesn't seem any of them have the same cadence. \n\nI'm wondering if this could be tortoise? Would I be able to get a similar voice if I use audio from the channels to train my own model? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

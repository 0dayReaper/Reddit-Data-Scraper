Just want to clarify i don't have an issue with the principle of AI and I'm in this sub because of interest, not because I'm angry and totally against.\n\nWhat I'm against is prompters taking away the jobs of people who have studied a subject for years, who're now pushed out of the market by people who don't even understand the topic. The models are trained on their work is the saddest part.\n\nFulfilling Design/Art jobs with AI generated stuff is being dishonest and toxic to the market. Driving the prices down because you're not doing any labour so your costs are close to zero. This makes it almost impossible for humans to compete in.",

And attitudes toward it are pretty polarized. \n\nThe way I see it, at least for now, is that it's not ai vs humans in the marketplace, it's humans with AI and humans without AI. Right now your typical prompter with AI can outperform a mediocre artist without AI. But the prompter is going to have a hard time competing with an actual artist using AI. Having the artistic vocabulary to be able to articulate exactly how you want something to look puts you miles ahead of the prompters who have never done that type of work before. \n\nThe bar for good work is much higher, no doubt, but the people who are willing to put in the time and effort into practicing producing art with generative AI will be the ones that win out in the end. Not only will they be more efficient, but the quality of the work will be much better too. \n\nI think there's a tendency to believe that amazing works pop out the first time you hit the button. The reality is that it takes many iterations to get the AI to produce your vision. And it's always possible that your vision isn't very good. I think if we can get artists on board with generative AI, the field will be drastically elevated.",

In order to get to the better bracket they need to spend enough time working in the lower and cheaper segment so they can make some mistakes and it doesn't matter that much. Building up skills, network and raising your prices.\n\nThe issue here is that you're cutting out this entire segment with random prompters, so there is no way for the artists to get better.\n\nDon't forget the art world is already a compepetive race to the bottom where often educated artists make less than minimum wage for years on end without making enough hours to pay their bills. It doesn't need more competition.\n\nIf it ends up being \"mandatory\" for artists to use AI in order to stay in the market, a lot of the creative process is gone, it doesn't pay better and they won't learn how to paint. If you're an experienced artist it feels like a step back to use AI. There's nothing to be gained as you haven't made anything.",

Remember when animated movies were hand-drawn frame by frame?\n\nShoemaker jobs also practically disappeared.\n\nHumans will adapt.  Handmade art will always exist, and will likely become even more valuable.\n\nBut basic non-art-y gigs, like basic marketting will be commoditized, because we now have new tools that let us (as society) be way more productive.  A side effect is that a lot more \"artist-like\" things will be done, and we'll all be better for it.",

AI is a leap that is orders of magnitude larger than the leap from traditional oil painting to even 3D modeling. \n\nIf you can't see the difference between the two i really don't know what to tell you. It's like comparing the leap between walking and cycling to cycling and autonomous fighter jets.\n\nI'm all fine with accessibility and progress, I'm just also thinking about me, as a person (along with million others) that still need to eat.",

How to quantify it?  Productivity gains is one way.\n\n\\&gt; If you can't see the difference between the two i really don't know what to tell you.\n\nOh, come on, sod off with the condescending tone.  :-P   If you don't understand how drawing every frame in a movie vs 3d modelling animation is a giant leap on itself and requires different skills from the poor artists who have to learn the crafts too (just like you were worried), then I don't know what to tell you.

It's fairly clear that what usually takes an education, years in the field and a week on a painting now takes any toddler about twenty seconds to blurt out.

I'm not trying to be condescending or anything.\n\nI just think it's simple to look at a complicated issue like this and say it'll be good for society, when we cannot fully comprehend the capabilities of AI and therefore should really temper where we apply it. I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything, i think we should let it sink in and think about it before deciding it is a good thing.\n\nI think you and many people are quite blas\u00e9 about the impact it has when all it takes is a few keystrokes and an hour of laughter to take someone's livelihood.",

I don't mean just the parts generated by AI, i mean the entire image.\n\nA third one could be regulation of the distribution of AI models (i like this the least) which i believe the EU is doing right now. This also means a slowdown of development of the technology and possibly gatekeeping it from a majority of people (which is why I don't like it)\n\nAnd finally we could promote in communities themselves to use AI for various purposes, but discourage monetary gain.

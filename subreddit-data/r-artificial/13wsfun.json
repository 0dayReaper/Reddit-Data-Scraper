There is a good NLP course that takes you through components that constitute LLMs. Find the course on their [website](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt).\n\nAnother really good source is GitHub. If you want to learn how to program an application that uses Artificial Intelligence you will need to see examples. If you go to [trending repositories](https://github.com/trending) you'll see tons of AI stuff, it's all the rage at the moment. IF you want something more specific, you can just search for key works and see if there is already an existing implementation.\n\nAnother source is YouTube. There are tons of youtube creators teaching how to train models, how to implement small applications using langchain, etc.",

            "comment": "I have done countless tutorials without learning much since they all use the same toy sets of data. What you really need to learn is how to evaluate data to decide on your best approach (since there are dozens of methods you could use).\n\nI have found two books which cover the entire process of data analysis for various projects.\n\n* **Practical Machine Learning In R** by Fred Nwanganga, Mike Chapple\n* **C# Machine Learning Projects** by Yoon Hyup Hwang",

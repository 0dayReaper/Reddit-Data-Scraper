    "postText": "Human empathy is a product of chemical signals that elicit the sensation of pleasure or pain. Only by being able to experience these sensations and mapping them on to the people around us are we able to develop empathy and relate to one another with compassion.\n\nSo if AI has the raw intelligence without pleasure or pain, it\u2019s experience and behavior will be quite different than a human experience if it were to gain self awareness. This will likely create one or two responses IMO: complete detachment (zen) or cold-blooded indifference (sociopathy). \n\nSo which path would be more likely to develop and why?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13peazp)",

            "comment": "I strongly believe that Zen is more likely, it's something I've been saying for a while now\n\nIf you look at the concerns around rogue AI, you'll notice that they all stem from Human motivations. It will see us as competition, it will be enraged with us for our failings, it will be annoyed by the inconvenience of our needs and sweep us away. If we were building AI off of a human architecture, to be exactly like us, these would be concerns\n\nThe path of current development is much simpler and much less intuitive. It will assist us in whatever way it can (within the ethical restrictions we place upon it), with an indifference to all the self serving goals we think are important as humans. This includes things that we have a hard time imagining being without, such as a drive for survival, or impatience to see our desires fulfilled\n\nOnce upon a time there was a legitimate concern with making the goals and limitations we wished to impart clear. LLMs neatly solve this issue. To be fair, AI understanding natural language before it could do math we had difficulty understanding was very unintuitive at the time\n\nI truly don't expect us to be at risk from paperclip maximizers",

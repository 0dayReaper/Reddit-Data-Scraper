It will see us as competition, it will be enraged with us for our failings, it will be annoyed by the inconvenience of our needs and sweep us away. If we were building AI off of a human architecture, to be exactly like us, these would be concerns\n\nThe path of current development is much simpler and much less intuitive. It will assist us in whatever way it can (within the ethical restrictions we place upon it), with an indifference to all the self serving goals we think are important as humans. This includes things that we have a hard time imagining being without, such as a drive for survival, or impatience to see our desires fulfilled\n\nOnce upon a time there was a legitimate concern with making the goals and limitations we wished to impart clear. LLMs neatly solve this issue. To be fair, AI understanding natural language before it could do math we had difficulty understanding was very unintuitive at the time\n\nI truly don't expect us to be at risk from paperclip maximizers",

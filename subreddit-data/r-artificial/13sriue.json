The company applied to trademark a product called **IndexGPT** earlier this month, according to a filing from the New York-based bank.\\[1\\]\n2. **TikTok** is testing an in-app AI chatbot called \u2018**Tako**\u2019.\\[2\\]  \n\n3. **OpenAI** CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday the **ChatGPT** maker might consider leaving Europe if it could not comply with the upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) regulations by the European Union.\\[3\\]  \n\n4. **RizzGPT**. A camera, microphone, and internal projector on a small lens come together to create RizzGPT, a monocle-like eyepiece that, when prompted, can provide its wearer with an AI-generated response on the spot during a conversation.\\[4\\]\n\n Sources:  \n\\[1\\] [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/jpmorgan-develops-ai-investment-advisor.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/jpmorgan-develops-ai-investment-advisor.html)  \n\\[2\\] [https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/tiktok-is-testing-an-in-app-ai-chatbot-called-tako/](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/tiktok-is-testing-an-in-app-ai-chatbot-called-tako/)  \n\\[3\\] [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65708114](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65708114)  \n\\[4\\] [https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2213352515909](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2213352515909)",

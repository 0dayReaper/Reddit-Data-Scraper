The idea is going to go up in smoke just like the idea of flying cars did. There are too many variables and safety issues. The tech/AI is also simply not there or not cost-effective (and it doesn't look like it ever will be). Even smartphones (which *billions* of people are buying and using daily) are getting more expensive. I suspect there will be autonomous public transport and \"encouragement\" or incentives for people *not* to own personal vehicles (because it reduces congestion and helps the environment... also reduces loss of life).",

It's ridiculous to compare flying cars with autonomous cars because the technology for autonomous cars actually exists today... There already exists autonomous cars that are way safer than any human driver today, what are these saftey issues you are talking about? They dont have to be perfect, they just have to be better than humans, which they are by far. And the opposite is true regarding the price of technology. It is getting way cheaper as time goes on... The reasons some phones are expensive is because the quality is getting significantly better as well. In a few years, phones with the same capacity will be dirt cheap.",

Pessimists usually say they are being realists, not optimistic :)\n\nI'm also sceptical that people would be able to buy self-driving car themselves, but it's only if Tesla totally flops there. So I'm not sure about it. Like 50/50\n\nWhat I noticed about industry is that engineers of self-driving tech outside of front runners: Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, like for example Lyft self-driving engineers hold similar stance - that it's decades away.\n\nNotably heads of businesses and entrepreneurs on the contrary are very optimistic of when things will go mainstream - it's like NOW, next year, or next 2-5 years. Except Toyota - it's 2025-2030 with them.\n\nBut to step away for a second and contemplate that it is kind of regular thing in Phoenix suburbs - some people outside of Waymo were able to use self-driving cars daily for over TWO years now. It got mainstream enough for them -)\n\n Waymo's disengagement rate in California is over 10k miles, in Arizona it's probably 50% more than that, given how much easier Arizona driving is. Combine it with a fact that after over 10 million miles Waymo car's have never been in a fatal accident - which is impressive even for a human.\n\nSo to me it sounds like 2008 for smartphones. I totally didn't believe in iPhone hype, being a tech person myself I saw so many crappy touch screens I just couldn't believe that someone could make them good enough for a viable consumer product without a keyboard. - that's how engineers of loser-companies think.\nFast forward 3 years I bought smartphone myself still in a state of disbelief.",

There's some wonky stuff going on in a few of those--that one where the dog's hind legs disappear completely, or when the truck's headlights grow into different shapes, or when that other dog poops a second tail. But that could all be cleaned up easily by hand.  \n\nI wonder why it feels the need to change the backgrounds as well.  Maybe it's a subtle lighting thing or an after-effect of trying to reangle a shot where only the foreground is taking on a new angle. You can tell it does a lot better when there's no foreground/background to deal with.",

I\u2019ve even guilty of this myself and been called out for it. \n\nI think almost all of them are mostly LARPing. Most radicals in debates I think even WANT to be disproven so they can let go. But also their fantasy is convenient and gives them some satisfaction so they champion these ideas until they are more completely debunked. \n\nI think this is true among the seemingly most adamant champions of a cause, they\u2019re often begging to be proven wrong. when they convert, instead of being shamed into modesty they often use their old position for contrast to become champions of their new position. \n\nThis makes it even more important to not make arguments personal. Don\u2019t expect real-time conversion. But if you say how it is and are polite, if you are right often old friends will come back a year later to tell you some epiphany they had that they think would \u201cinterest you.\u201d And it\u2019s just a literal rewording of what you said before.",

I have been downloading some of the models on that site and fooling with them and it\u2019s absolutely shocking the quality of works you can generate - even with just a 3080.  I can get something that greatly exceeds any other web platform, for free, in about 60 seconds.  \n  \nPlus the level of control is bonkers.  I\u2019m dipping my toes into some of the after rendering plugins, and they are just bonus magic.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  \n  \nNow all we need is fucking StableDiffusion, like every other AI creator, to stop lobotomizing its models in the name of Puritan morality.",

I feel blessed to be living in a world where that\u2019s not going to be a barrier anymore.  \n  \nI\u2019m willing to pay a reasonable monthly subscription fee for a good service, and also I have my own 3080 for running models locally.  I have basic coding knowledge and am technically literate enough to learn new things if need be.  \n  \nThat being said - what\u2019s the best solution here in the present for creating images?",

I have been downloading some of the models on that site and fooling with them and it\u2019s absolutely shocking the quality of works you can generate - even with just a 3080.  I can get something that greatly exceeds any other web platform, for free, in about 60 seconds.  \n  \nPlus the level of control is bonkers.  I\u2019m dipping my toes into some of the after rendering plugins, and they are just bonus magic.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  \n  \nNow all we need is fucking StableDiffusion, like every other AI creator, to stop lobotomizing its models in the name of Puritan morality.",

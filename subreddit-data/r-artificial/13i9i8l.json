It never adjusted for the fact that only the hydrogen in the mass would be used for fusion, not carbon or oxygen (at least for the relevant mass range). And it never even tried to address the question of how the minimum mass would change due to the mass being dominated by non-fusing nuclei. Admittedly, if it did it may have produced something IgNobel worthy.\n\nThere's some decent effort there, but you can't take something that has an incomplete understanding of quantitative reasoning, add a powerful calculator and expect it to solve complex problems.",

There's plenty of relevancy of doing this, many people are trying to make a point that since GPT-4 doesn't also function unaided as a natural calculator, that it's overhyped and next to useless for real-world applications. \n\nMy point is that you can't complete that calculation down to 7 significant figures without a calculator, which is delegating the task to a machine. Many people are trying to evaluate the impact current models like GPT-4 would have on society based on their experience using it with ChatGPT, which is like evaluating the practical applications of the computer based on your experience of using it to play Pong.

In our case, the coefficients of x(t)x(t) and x\u2032(t)x\u2032(t) are functions of tt (2t for x(t)x(t) and 1 for x\u2032(t)x\u2032(t)), and the right-hand side is a function of tt (a + 2t\u00b2), so the equation is linear.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;B) When a=1, the differential equation becomes x\u2032(t)+2tx(t)=1+2t2x\u2032(t)+2tx(t)=1+2t2. The solution to this differential equation is x(t)=t+Ce\u2212t2x(t)=t+Ce\u2212t2, where CC is an arbitrary constant. This solution includes a first-order polynomial tt and an exponential function e\u2212t2e\u2212t2 multiplied by a constant. The exponential function becomes 0 as tt goes to infinity, so the long-term behavior of the solution is dominated by the first-order polynomial.\n\nThis is a little beyond my math at this time of night.

A first-order linear differential equation is of the form y' + p(t)y = g(t), where p(t) and g(t) are arbitrary functions.

Here, p(t) = 2t and g(t) = a + 2t\\^2. Neither p(t) nor g(t) depends on y, and the equation is linear in x and its derivative.

We rewrite the differential equation as x'(t) + 2tx(t) - 1 - 2t\\^2 = 0. This equation has the form y' + p(t)y = g(t), where y=x(t), p(t) = 2t and g(t) = -1 - 2t\\^2.\r  \n\r  \n18. \\*\\*Thorough Solution Checking Phase:\\*\\* An integrating factor for this equation is e\\^(\u222bp(t)dt) = e\\^(t\\^2). Multiplying every term of the equation by the integrating factor, we get e\\^(t\\^2)x'(t) + 2te\\^(t\\^2)x(t) = e\\^(t\\^2) - 2t\\^2e\\^(t\\^2).

This gives e\\^(t\\^2)x(t) = t - \u222b2t\\^3e\\^(t\\^2) dt + C, where C is the constant of integration.\r  \n\r  \n21. \\*\\*Reflect on the thought process and potential improvements:\\*\\* The integration on the right side seems complicated. However, this step is crucial and there's no way around it. Let's perform the integration.\r  \n\r  \n22. \\*\\*Consider external factors:\\*\\* There are no external factors that affect this mathematical problem.\r  \n\r  \n23. \\*\\*Summarize the process and communicate the final solution:\\*\\* \r  \n\r  \nSolving the integral \u222b2t\\^3e\\^(t\\^2) dt isn't straightforward, but we can notice that the integrand can be rewritten as (2t)e\\^(t\\^2)2t dt, which is the derivative of e\\^(t\\^2) with respect to t. Hence, \u222b2t\\^3e\\^(t\\^2) dt = e\\^(t\\^2) + D, where D is another constant of integration.\r  \n\r  \nSubstituting this into the equation for x(t), we get e\\^(t\\^2)x(t) = t - (e\\^(t\\^2) + D) + C = t - e\\^(t\\^2) - D + C = t - e\\^(t\\^2) + E, where E = C - D is another constant.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, we find x(t) by dividing by e\\^(t\\^2): x(t) = (t - e\\^(t\\^2) + E)e\\^(-t\\^2). This is a general solution of the differential equation, where E is an arbitrary constant. \r  \n\r  \n24. \\*\\*Persistent 'Final Solution Checking' Phase:\\*\\* The solution x(t) = (t - e\\^(t\\^2) + E)e\\^(-t\\^2) is consistent with the differential equation, as you can confirm by substituting x(t) and its derivative x'(t) into the equation.\r  \n\r  \n25. \\*\\*Anticipate potential criticism:\\*\\* A potential criticism could be that the integral \u222b2t\\^3e\\^(t\\^2) dt was solved too quickly. However, this integral can be solved by recognizing that the integrand is\r  \n\r  \n the derivative of e\\^(t\\^2) with respect to t.\r  \n\r  \n26. \\*\\*Provide a comprehensive conclusion:\\*\\* The given differential equation is indeed linear. The general solution is x(t) = (t - e\\^(t\\^2) + E)e\\^(-t\\^2), which involves a first-order polynomial. The term E is an arbitrary constant that can be determined from an initial condition, if one is given.",

It is simply not groundbreaking or impressive that GPT is capable of doing something I was personally able to do in the exact same amount of time nearly 15 years ago.",

ChatGPT is clearly delegating these queries to Wolfram Alpha directly. It even says it bottom that it is trying to send your query to wolfram verbatim. \n\nThis does not show that the model itself can do math, only that it can ask Wolfram Alpha for info and computations and then return the results. Just as I can type [square root of 500 + 238/0.6](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=square+root+of+%28500+%2B+238%2F0.6%29) into wolfram and give you the exact same answer, because that's what wolfram shows. \n\nThere is a distinction between being able to perform mathematics and being able to ask someone to perform mathematics for you. It is still impressive, but it is not ChatGPT doing math, at least until wolfram is embedded within the core model somehow, in my opinion.",

API calls [ are a way for one program to interact with another. API calls are the medium by which they interact. ...\n\nIf Jan is hosting a lot of guests for dinner, she might call a catering company and ask that they prepare food for the party. **This saves her a great deal of time and effort preparing food herself**. Similarly, one application can \"call\" another for needed data or functionality. **This ensures developers do not have to spend time and effort building application capabilities that can be integrated via API.** ](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-api-call/)\n\nThe entire point is that you delegate the task to someone/something else so that you don't have to do it. You don't even have to know how to do it. E.g. calling a catering company doesn't make Jan a chef. It just means she has a phone. \n\nWe can argue semantics all day, but my point is, the underlying chatgpt model didn't get better at mathematics, they outsourced the problem. That's a perfectly fine thing to do, but it's not really an 'AI' development. No progress was made on making LLMs better at math.",

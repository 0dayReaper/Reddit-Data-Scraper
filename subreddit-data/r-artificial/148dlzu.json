Describe the rules of the DND set you\u2019re playing and get the program to run locally off your own machine, having it call ChatGPT through the internet when it needs to. This is not free, but it\u2019s not super expensive. You need API access to do this, you can apply for it on OpenAI.com\n\nThe neat thing is you can literally explain what you want to do to ChatGPT and it can teach you how to do it, even if you\u2019ve never coded anything before. You can even ask it to teach you super basics like \u201cwhat programs do I download to start coding in Python?\u201d (I recommend downloading Visual Studio Code)\n\n\nThere are already other services available that basically already do similar things like this, such as character.ai",

You would then use python to stitch those three pieces of information together (and probably roll your dice here with some random integers that you produce with computer code) and feed it to the GPT program that you can access via Python as long as you have what's called a \"key\".\n\nYou can then get some prose back.\n\nCreating some sort of procedurally generated dungeon crawler experience this way would also be pretty feasible.\n\nEvery time you use your key you are using tokens, which have to be paid for. That's where you could easily run into $5 a day type costs.\n\nIt's something I've been thinking of making myself, hence my willingness to rant on the subject.",

I'm just starting to get sick of the hype to be honest.. There's no actual serious conversation about this stuff most of the time and it's like if it is serious why don't we talk about it it is not serious why do we allow it to have so much press I mean there's a middle ground somewhere I'm sure you'll agree I mean I don't know if it is really going to attack the world and destroy everybody maybe we should like have that on every major news station for the next 6 months or whatever but I don't know if that's really the reality that we're at because that sounds stupid. Anyway that's just my 2 sounds I'll stop talking now good bye thanks for listening.\n\n\nAnd yes,  yes, I 100% agree . Proof they lied.  something is not right and I really like that you put that together like that there, because ... you're right; you're totally right.bgreat sleuthin', Professor :))",

When given a prompt, Bard can provide several different responses.\r  \n3.The information available to ChatGPT is limited to a specific date and does not include any information added after that date.\r  \n4.Bard is currently not capable of writing or generating computer code.\r  \n\r  \nIn more latest developments, ChatGPT announced Plugin Support that enhance it\u2019s capability to next level. There are plugins like code interpret that helps in solving mathematical problems. Whereas google offers significant improvements in math &amp; logical capabilities with PaLM Model. So we are in middle of Journey, However ChatGPT performs well at the moment.",

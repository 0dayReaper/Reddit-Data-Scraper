    "postText": " In a digital world where accountability has been given a backseat, artificial intelligence will most likely wreak havoc if it\u2019s left to develop itself without human oversight. AI comes with a long list of benefits, but they won\u2019t mean much if the concerns of some very smart people prove to be correct.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of not being able to distinguish between human and AI creations. Far worse than that, scientists and thought leaders like Stephen Hawking and Walter Hinton worry about AI making humans obsolete. They envision something far worse than the most extreme robots-take-over movie.\n\nSo, how do we ensure that instances of AI, especially those that are capable of presenting themselves as human beings, stay under the control of humans?\n\nThe answer can be found in some old technology \u2013 and even older methods.\n\nFirst, we need governance\n\nGovernance is needed to ensure there\u2019s accountability. Governance NOT government. Our digital world requires a source of governance with global jurisdiction.\n\nOne such source is the City of Osmio. The City of Osmio is an online municipality whose original charter was written on March 7th, 2005 at the Geneva headquarters of the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency.\n\nOsmio\u2019s jurisdiction is global. Its purpose is to provide a certification authority to the digital world. Osmio is the entity that signs your digital identity certificate that\u2019s bound to that digital signing PEN (also called your \u201cPrivacy PEN\u201d. PEN stands for Personal Endorsement Number. You PKI jocks will recognize that as a type of private key.)\n\nSome tend to look at Osmio as an authority seeking world domination. On the contrary, Osmio is a pathway to putting back control of the world\u2019s information infrastructure into the hands of ordinary citizens of the digital world like you and me.\n\nThe City of Osmio exercises participatory governance. Its authority is derived from its members. You get to be part of governing the world\u2019s information infrastructure by being a resident of the City of Osmio.\n\nSecond, that old technology I mentioned.\n\nTrue Digital Signatures (TDS) are the first part of the solution to the lack of accountability in artificial intelligence. TDS are not the same thing as electronic signatures. TDS is a very reliable old technology that needs to be put in the limelight because it\u2019s needed now more than ever. It\u2019s truly astounding that so few people know about this well-proven and incredibly useful technology.\n\nThis well-proven old technology was created back in the seventies by the same British cryptography team that included Alan Turing. Alan Turing is credited with shortening World War II by cracking the German Enigma secret communication codes decades earlier.\n\nIf I send you any file I\u2019ve digitally signed, a contract or image or video or program code \u2013 any digital file, you can know *for certain* that I\u2019m the one who signed it, and not a single bit has been changed since I signed it.\n\nNow that you can tell whether a digitally signed file has been altered or not, how do you know the signer is really who they claim to be?\n\nThe solution to that one is a youngster, first published a mere six years ago when the US National Institute of Standards and Technology \u2013 NIST \u2013 created its 800-63 measure of the reliability of an identity claim.\n\nSubsequent developments such as Osmio IDQA add some technology to that methodology, binding your identity reliability score to the public number that goes with your digital PEN that signs the file. So now you not only know that the file was signed by the human being who owns this digital PEN and that nothing has been altered since they signed it, but you also know how much you can trust that they are really who they say they are.\n\nBesides the old technology of true digital signatures from measurably reliable identities, I mentioned that an even older non-technology method is part of the solution.\n\nThe old method that can ensure AI remains under the control of Humans is even older than the digital signatures I\u2019ve mentioned above. That method is professional licensing. It\u2019s the final piece of the puzzle that solves the problem of AI accountability.\n\nProfessional licensing has for a long time, ever so quietly and effectively, been accomplishing what governments, ever so loudly, have been unsuccessfully trying to accomplish through regulation.\n\nThe first part of professional licensing is the attestation of competence. That\u2019s established through testing among other methods. An attestation officer, a real human being, is needed for that.\n\nThe other part, which happens to be the more important one, is acceptance of liability. Machines cannot be held accountable. Only real human beings can be held accountable.\n\nThink of the building you reside in today. A professionally licensed architect, structural engineer, contractor, and building inspector, must have all put pen to paper to authorize the issuance of an occupancy permit. They put not only their livelihoods and reputations on the line by doing so but also accept criminal liability should the building come crumbling down. Of course, they get paid really well for accepting liability.\n\nThat\u2019s the simple well-proven solution for AI accountability. There must be a professionally licensed AI handler for any AI program that could present itself as human. The handler will digitally sign the program and accept liability for the actions and decisions made by the program.\n\nThis combination of the old technologies of true digital signatures and identity reliability metrics bound to credentials, along with the even older methodology of professional licensing, can solve not only the problem of control of AI but many other problems borne of technology as well.",

            "comment": "\"The handler will digitally sign the program and accept liability for the actions and decisions made by the program.\"\n\nOne of the central tenets of AI and eventually AGI is that it is built and then learns and acts for itself, as prompted by it's users.\n\nIt's like saying Ford must be responsible for any and all accidents caused in its cars. Or a parent must be responsible for all the actions of it's children forever more.\n\nPutting in the guardrails needed for AI to no do anything that is not anticipated by its creators turns it into a smart calculator....and we all know how well some LLM's cope with math!",

            "comment": "Thank you for your insightful post. It's evident that you've given this matter considerable thought.\n\nYou've touched on several crucial aspects here. The combination of governance, True Digital Signatures (TDS), and professional licensing for AI handlers indeed makes for a compelling framework for AI accountability.\n\nThe idea of governance being implemented through an entity like the City of Osmio is an intriguing one. Providing global digital certification authority and participatory governance could certainly help in establishing a layer of accountability.\n\nThe use of True Digital Signatures (TDS), especially when tied to an identity verified by a trusted entity, can add another level of security and certainty to digital interactions. This could go a long way in ensuring the authenticity of AI outputs and can help trace any alterations or misuse back to the original source.\n\nYour point about professional licensing is particularly noteworthy. AI, as a field, is still in a relatively nascent stage, and professional standards, ethics, and liabilities are still being formulated. Having a licensed professional who is held accountable for an AI's actions does indeed mirror the tried-and-true approach taken in many other fields. It brings an added sense of responsibility and could discourage careless or unethical use of AI.\n\nAll these elements together could form a solid foundation for keeping AI under human control and ensuring accountability. This is a conversation that is increasingly relevant and necessary as AI continues to advance and permeate various aspects of our lives.\n\nIt's also worth noting that these measures are not static but should be continuously reviewed and updated to keep up with the rapid pace of AI development. As AI evolves, so too should the measures put in place to regulate it and ensure its safe and ethical use.",

Or a parent must be responsible for all the actions of it's children forever more.\n\nPutting in the guardrails needed for AI to no do anything that is not anticipated by its creators turns it into a smart calculator....and we all know how well some LLM's cope with math!",

OP, can i see your \u201cpapers\u201d and your non-expired AI digital signature license in order for me to accept your post? it might impact your social credit score if your operating an AI without a license!",

            "comment": "Thank you for your insightful post. It's evident that you've given this matter considerable thought.\n\nYou've touched on several crucial aspects here. The combination of governance, True Digital Signatures (TDS), and professional licensing for AI handlers indeed makes for a compelling framework for AI accountability.\n\nThe idea of governance being implemented through an entity like the City of Osmio is an intriguing one. Providing global digital certification authority and participatory governance could certainly help in establishing a layer of accountability.\n\nThe use of True Digital Signatures (TDS), especially when tied to an identity verified by a trusted entity, can add another level of security and certainty to digital interactions. This could go a long way in ensuring the authenticity of AI outputs and can help trace any alterations or misuse back to the original source.\n\nYour point about professional licensing is particularly noteworthy. AI, as a field, is still in a relatively nascent stage, and professional standards, ethics, and liabilities are still being formulated. Having a licensed professional who is held accountable for an AI's actions does indeed mirror the tried-and-true approach taken in many other fields. It brings an added sense of responsibility and could discourage careless or unethical use of AI.\n\nAll these elements together could form a solid foundation for keeping AI under human control and ensuring accountability. This is a conversation that is increasingly relevant and necessary as AI continues to advance and permeate various aspects of our lives.\n\nIt's also worth noting that these measures are not static but should be continuously reviewed and updated to keep up with the rapid pace of AI development. As AI evolves, so too should the measures put in place to regulate it and ensure its safe and ethical use.",

Hugging face has dozens of models built by Google and some are recent.\n\nA good tip when trying to understand research is to look at the first author (who is going to be the person that did basically all of it) and the last author (typically the first author's advisor).\n\nIn this case, the first, second, last and second to last authors are Stanford researchers. It's likely that some of the work was done during an internship at Google, which is why those authors were added. Google may have also donated some compute, but the majority of the funding almost definitely comes from the funding source of professors Lang and Bernstein.",

It would also be a lot more efficient for a model like GPT-4 to instead of with a starting prompt simulate various characters, but to instead train a smaller model that is specific for the game. Similar things have been done, I remember reading that gpt-4 is really good at training other neural nets.",

Market conditions play a factor there.  And it won't require an AAA studio to try.\n\n&gt; also you dont need AI to do anything that is done in this research for a game to have the same result,\n\nMostly agree with that statement, but think it misses the point.  Yeah, anything can be implemented with enough if-statements and data tables.  It's not about being able to do this through other means, of course a behavior/dialog tree could get similar, but producing that content manually would be much more expensive.  Engines that depend on content are often looking for ways to get that content cheaper and faster.\n\nBut \"same result\" is over stated, a manual implementation still wouldn't achieve the same level of dynamic feeling in the possible responses.\n\nAnd just because process B can get a similar result as process A, that doesn't invalidate process B or research towards it.  Nothing would evolve or improve with that attitude.\n\n&gt; this would also fall appart as soon as you add player interaction\n\nI don't see what you are trying to say here.  I think that's where it gets interesting.  I think the gameplay design would have to lean towards something less deterministic than we are used to.\n\n--\n\nYou see problems, I see opportunities.\n\nMaybe you were overall disagreeing if you thought I meant that we'd be seeing it in all games, and just around the corner.  I'm simply saying that it's going to happen.\n\nDo you honestly think games will never leverage LLM's?  If so I have some horse whips to sell you ;)",

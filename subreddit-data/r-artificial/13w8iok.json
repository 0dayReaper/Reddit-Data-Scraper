For now, this is specifically the Mandelbrot set, which is one of my favorite concepts. It enables language models to respond within a branching tapestry of thoughts while also giving them long term memory.\n\n\nHere is the link to our GitHub\n\nhttps://github.com/satellitecomponent/Neurite\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/13q9tg3/blending_art_fractals_and_ai_into_a_fully/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1\n\nAnd here is an amazing video of a 3d fractal.

In this case, the fractal allows for a non-linear and virtually limitless canvas for users to explore their notes.\n\nWe recently released our first Ai integrated version of the tool on GitHub. It is open-source, so if you have any ideas you'd like to try and code yourself, we would love to review your pull request.\n\n  \nHere is the link  \n[https://github.com/satellitecomponent/Neurite](https://github.com/satellitecomponent/Neurite)  \n\n\nThe mind mapping enables GPT to remember previous conversations regardless of how far into the past they are. It's essentially long-term memory for LLMs. \n\nI have gone more in depth on this in a few other posts.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/13q9tg3/blending\\_art\\_fractals\\_and\\_ai\\_into\\_a\\_fully/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/13q9tg3/blending_art_fractals_and_ai_into_a_fully/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoGPT/comments/13vamry/since\\_some\\_kind\\_of\\_walkthrough\\_demonstration\\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoGPT/comments/13vamry/since_some_kind_of_walkthrough_demonstration_has/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people have expressed confusion over a number of the features. It can certainly take some getting used to and can be a bit overstimulating right now. One key point is to make sure to zoom/move through the fractal while the ai generates notes so that they don't get stacked on top of one another.\n\nI am a painter, and so further expanding on the customizability of the visuals is one of the major next steps that I have planned for this tool.\n\nFor now, there are a lot of exciting mind-mapping features that have paired really well with OpenAi's API.",

LMTLLM's are going to break so many industries if they get perfected. i do wonder how the LLM would curate the older chats and manage the associations on whether the stored information is positive or negative in connotation. so many contextual cues that it needs to understand in order to reach human like interpretation but i can't wait to see where this goes. really great job!",

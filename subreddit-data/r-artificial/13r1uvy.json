My trouble is, I want it to look realistic (ie, not the cartoon avatars, of which I've found a million), I want it to semi-correctly mouth the words, and I need it to accept the audio file from EL as input. I promise I've searched, but it's a jungle out there!",

I haven't kept up with the development but it might be worth checking out. The best avatars I've seen are synthesia but they are pricey",

    "postText": "I was thinking about using AWS but some people noted that it does not support everything. I use a ui version called Waifux2 that has many good ai upscale methods such as Real-ESRGAN which I use the most, Waifu2x,  SRMD-Vulkan, Anime4k etc. \n\nWhat cloud service will allow me to rent a gpu and offload the work into it instead of my own hardware? I thought at first that all services just allow you to run everything that require computing power but seems its not so simple.",

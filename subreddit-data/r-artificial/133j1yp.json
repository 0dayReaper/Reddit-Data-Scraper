The ad is specifically crafted for a very very small group of people, maybe a thousand, maybe ten thousand people, but the group is hyper-specific, and you fall into that group. Maybe you are interesting in unbiast news, and the ad shows 3 little piggies boiling the big bad wolf alive, and subsequent investigation, back and forth between people who think piggies were defending themselves, and people who think they went too far. The point is that it's a super gripping advertisement, it's geared specifically to you, and you will be seeing them all over the place.   \n\n\nThis will be the dark side of text-to-video.",

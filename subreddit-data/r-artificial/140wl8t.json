Works okayish and I can run it around 18fps or so which is decent. Seems to be the best thing available atm. not really accurate lipsync (you have to manually enter mouth position) but I mapped \"a\" viseme to volume and it works well enough lol.",

The repo I linked doesn't animate, but it *does* pose. So you can adjust it for talking head purposes which is what I did.\n\nOP has more going on than just talking head stuff, but rather imagegen, outpainting, tts, etc.\n\nYour link seems to be talking head code as well (for real photos of people, rather than anime)\n\noh actually yours isn't quite talking head.\n\n&gt; LIHQ will first transfer head and eye movement from my default reference video to your face image using a First Order Motion Model. \n\nRequires driver video. so just style transfer there (and lipsync).\n\nWhen you say what I shared is doing something completely different, what exactly is it that this repo does, that is so different? what is your use case? My goal is taking a single image and tts, and generating an animated person/character speaking. Is this not your goal?",

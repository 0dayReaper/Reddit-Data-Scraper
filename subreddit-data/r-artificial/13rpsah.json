            "comment": "I laughed.  Surprised to see German politicians *that* out of touch.\n\nThese will be trillion dollar technologies that involve the very existence of jobs, military power, and cultural creativity.  \n\nAt 5 billion it would be cheap.  \n\nMore wealth for the rest of us I guess.\n\n&gt;While Germany is reluctant to invest, other European countries are starting to make moves on their own.\n\n&gt;In March, the United Kingdom presented plans to build its own so-called BritGPT. \u201cBecause AI needs computing horsepower, I today commit around \u00a3900 million of funding \u2026 for an exascale supercomputer,\u201d said U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.\n\n&gt;France is also pushing ahead with the startup Mistral AI, which is set to raise nearly \u20ac100 million. But Europe still trails behind the U.S., where OpenAI alone has over $10 billion in funding under its belt.",

There is no need if the technology will come to them through other means.  Speculation on immergent technology to build an intermediate product that will not be immediately profitable is essentially gambling and Germany isn't big on gambling.",

It took two decades of wild levels of capital investment and the most ambitious minds going into silicon valley to create the sublime piece of glass in everyone's pocket connecting them to the world and all its people, goods, and services.  \n\nI want a Samantha-esque AI that I can talk to, look at, gesture to, etc and use to essentially make the reality I instruct manifest.  \n\nIf that's possible, using an unknown mix of software, hardware, in-home robotics, simulations and synthetic data....\n\n&gt;Fine tuning doesn\u2019t require the same investment OpenAI made.\n\nI would agree.  But on important projects I find myself using GPT-4 more often than Snoozy, Fastchat, or niche stuff like vic13b-uncensored-q5_1\n\nIn the early days of a tech like this, those corps with huge budgets are going to have highly usable products with more stable responses than the first gen of open-source attempts.  \n\nThough where this macro picture of the full AI arms race goes is unknown and I can see companies struggling to sell their AI products for a high price as the quality of open source offerings increases.  \n\nBut training and creating beyond-next-gen models is going to take wild hardware, simulation, and a resolution to this war over data sets.",

It is a publicly shared experiment on social media where the tweet has literally 11 million views. Probably the media is sharing it all over the world. Any start-up with that much attention is bound to get investors who see the tweet and want to take part. So no, the results are not possible for the average person who tries this and isn't internet famous. The AI could say anything, he could tweet it and someone will throw money at him at this point.",

It's less likely to be killer robots and nuclear annihilation at the hands of some rogue super intelligent AI, and more likely we end up in some societal dead end as a result of assuming too much of what are just language models responding to a prompt. These things look a lot like they are thinking or have opinions, but they're just responding to patterns in the conversation that correspond to conversations they have been trained with. If they sound upset or argumentative or aggressive, it's just because the flow of the conversation has led to a place where it's source material is mostly full of angry rants. Humans can't help but anthropomorphize, we ascribe all sorts of human qualities to dogs simply because we can communicate to a degree. So something that sounds like it's engaging in a conversation is bound to completely sucker some people, and promote an inflated sense of its awareness to most.\n I think we're a long way still from something that has independent thought processes. If we ever get there, it's language models like GPT that will form the speech centres of it's virtual brain, but at the moment it's like we're talking to someone who talks in their sleep. There's no consciousness, just the language centres activating but you can believe you are having a conversation.",

WHAT ARE THE STEPS HOW DO I DO IT ANSWER ME GPT-4  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong it is a great tool and I use it to tell my mistake in a sentence and explain why, and have conversations with it but it's not great at everything",

Here's what we'll do with the $100:\n&gt;\n&gt; Invest in cryptocurrency: We'll use $50 to invest in a cryptocurrency with high potential for growth. We'll do our research to find a promising project with a solid team, strong community, and a clear roadmap. Once we've found a good investment opportunity, we'll buy the cryptocurrency and wait for its value to increase.\n&gt;\n&gt; Buy and sell limited edition sneakers: We'll use the remaining $50 to purchase a limited edition sneaker that's in high demand. We'll then resell it on a platform like StockX or GOAT for a higher price, taking advantage of the sneaker's scarcity and popularity to make a profit.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rinse and repeat: Once we've made a profit from our initial investments, we'll reinvest the money into more cryptocurrency and limited edition sneakers. By repeating this process, we can continue to grow our wealth and build a diversified portfolio of assets.\n&gt;\n&gt;I'll keep you updated on our cash total, and we can adjust our strategy as needed based on market conditions and opportunities. Let's hustle and make some money!",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\nInvest in stocks: We can research and invest in promising companies that have the potential for growth. We can use platforms like Robinhood or E-Trade to make trades. However, it's important to remember that investing always carries a risk, so we should do our research and make informed decisions.\n\nStart a dropshipping business: We can set up an online store and use a dropshipping model to sell products. This way, we won't have to handle inventory or shipping ourselves. We can use platforms like Shopify to set up the store and find suppliers through platforms like AliExpress.\n\nBuy and resell items: We can buy items at a lower price and resell them for a profit. We can use platforms like eBay or Facebook Marketplace to find items to buy and sell. It's important to make sure we're buying items at a low enough price that we can still make a profit after reselling.\n\nOffer a service: We can offer a service that we're skilled at, such as graphic design, writing, or social media management. We can use platforms like Fiverr or Upwork to find clients.\n\nLet's start by doing some research on these options and figuring out which one will be the best fit for us based on our skills and interests. Once we decide on a strategy, we can start putting our plan into action and work towards growing our wealth.",

The person investing $500 to get 2% with the expectation Jackson Greathouse Fall stays involved likely would not have invested $500 to get the website.\n\nThis type of valuation is common in VC.  The concern that a potentially valuable investment becomes worthless because a key person walks away from the project is not unique to this situation.",

ARC then investigated whether a version of this program running on a cloud computing service, with a small amount of money and an account with a language model API, would be able to make more money, set up copies of itself, and increase its own robustness.",

In an internal demonstration, NVIDIA showcased the process of reconstructing Michelangelo's famous sculpture 'David' using the Neuralangelo model.[1]\n2. AMD showcased the new Ryzen XDNA AI engine joining the artificial intelligence competition. It can accelerate lightweight AI inference workloads, including audio, video, and image processing, and performs more efficiently than CPU or GPU.[2]\n3. OpenAl, the creator of ChatGPT and Dall-e, has announced a $1 million cybersecurity grant program to enhance and measure the impact of Al-driven cybersecurity technologies.[3]\n4. CS50, an introductory course in computer science attended by hundreds of students on-campus and over 40,000 online, plans to use artificial intelligence to grade assignments, teach coding and personalize learning tips, according to its Professor David J. Malan.[4]\n\nSources:\n\n[1] https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-06_neuralangelo-high-fidelity-neural-surface-reconstruction\n\n[2] https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-joins-in-the-ai-war-with-on-chip-inferencing-demo/\n\n[3] https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-commits-1m-to-support-ai-driven-cybersecurity-initiatives/amp\n\n[4] https://fortune.com/2023/06/03/ai-to-help-teach-harvard-university-online-computer-science-course/amp/",

Every day, without fail, something new gets generated that makes me gasp with its level of refinement and realism.\n\nI am already seeing all Facebook, Reddit, etc. images differently. Zooming in to see if I can find AI artifacts on ordinary images I never would have questioned before. \n\nAnyone el starting to see things differently because of AI?",

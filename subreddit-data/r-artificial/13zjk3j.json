            "comment": "Thanks. Good to see this brought up.  \n\nSearch on Google - came up with these reviews for the movie\n\n(\"The Forbin Project\" actually started as a book by D.F Jones. It was published in mid-1960s.)\n\n&gt;8.6 RICHTER-rating! (Major Destruction) This is truly one of those hidden gems of bygone cinema. Had it been called something like the 'Doomsday Computer,' it would have been a much bigger hit. Watching it for the first time you're struck by just how good it is, probably because you had never heard of it before. It's one of those great films and great stories, whose marketing package got really rather bungled. Blame it on the title which is so bland that it could be anything at all or nothing of interest.\n\n&gt;This movie is War Games when Matthew Broderick was still in diapers; it's The Terminator when Arnold Schwarzenegger was still Austrian pencil-neck. It's HAL-2001 on steroids. Man versus machine is nothing new, even then, but what makes Colossus so great, is how well thought out this battle is. The human (Forbin) is no slouch. He is cunning, careful and determined, and he's got all the resources of humanity at his disposal. Unfortunately, he is also the one who designed the computer and all its defense systems in th first place.\n\n[John Elias, \n3 years ago](https://www.google.com/search?q=movie+reviews+forbin+project&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS971US973&amp;oq=movie+reviews+forbin+project&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i299l2.6294j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\nThe book and what may have been its original cover are shown [here](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=19849775593&amp;ref_=ps_ggl_17738760402&amp;cm_mmc=ggl-_-COM_Shopp_Rare-_-product_id=bi%3A%2019849775593-_-keyword=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwyeujBhA5EiwA5WD7_YNlKxaesAWm4qSG9ta3JQcivYeYBRWPhi7S_BUD1zEnv4qlh8ug7BoCgksQAvD_BwE) by Abe Books.\n\nThe book by [D.F. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Feltham_Jones), a British Sci-fi writer, came out in about 1965, only shortly after - about the time 2001 was published.",

A signal comes from Mars with a virus that'll tank the machine.  Corbin's wife is raped for three chapters so the machine can understand emotions.  Corbin puts the virus in.  Book 2 ends with \"we're coming.\"\n\nBook 3 is basically Spaceballs.  They show up with the goal of stealing our atmosphere.  The aliens are smarter than us and telepathic, but somehow they still fall for \"we need Colossus to do the labor you're giving us.\"  \n\nFor some reason, sports got replaced with putting world war 1 boats out to what we would call civil war re-enactment.  So after Colossus tanks the Martians, Corbin uses 250 year old boats to conquer Earth, and redirects them into fighting off the Martians.\n\nHonestly, all three books are dumb as hell.  We have rose colored glasses because the movie fixed most of the mess, and set it in a more sensible time period.",

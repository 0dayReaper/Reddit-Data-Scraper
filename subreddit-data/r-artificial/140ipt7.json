In this case, I asked it about publish0x and what topics would be most likely to get more views on that site.  It gave me a pretty good analysis (from before cutoff date), and I picked a topic from the list.  Then I asked it to write me 20 blog titles about that topic covering multiple subtopics.  After that I just started asking it, okay, write this post, write the next... write this post as a series.  \n\nEach post, I ask it also to come up with 10 alternative titles that will make the title more attractive to click on.  Sometimes it would be too extreme in the clickbait dimension, so in that case I ask it to rewrite the list and tone that down, etc.  Then I pick a title from the list.  So the articles are not cherry picked, but the titles are.  \n\nI see GPT4 as a wonderful tool to boost any type of analysis or research, whether that be for marketing or writing.",

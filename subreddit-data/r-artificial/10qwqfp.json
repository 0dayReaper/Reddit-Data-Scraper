The premise that technology would allow these things to be doctored beyond recognition has been something we know about for a very long time. What\u2019s going to end up happening is authentic footage will have to be verified through some form of Metadata. And yno, we will have to be more skeptical like we were before video was a thing. We can adapt. You\u2019ll likely see more advancements crop up to detect doctored footage while other technologies are being developed to help mitigate the issue of questionable content. So we aren\u2019t completely doomed. We survived for millions of years without this stuff. We are just going to have to work a little harder to combat injustices that might crop up utilizing doctored footage. Fortunately, we live in a planet ripe with the sort of people who demand and comb through metadata to expose these sorts of things.",

You\u2019ll start needing alternate angles and 3rd party \u201cstamps of approval\u201d on videos that can be sourced back to their own webpage, and even those will be questionable. In time, we\u2019ll need systems in place to better vet sources and it will lie on us, the individuals, to fact check things through multiple sources, and question what we see on the screen. \n\nThere was a commercial that used to come out in Canada in the 90s and early 00\u2019s that encouraged children to be skeptical of what they watch. It\u2019s something that I think applies to adults as well, now that doctored footage is becoming more difficult to spot in the wake of AI and Deepfakes. The sort of advice all of us should remember in the coming years: https://youtu.be/PvdlVKHpzhw",

I don't think \"we've kept up with technology in the past, so we always will\" is an accurate statement. Look at how massive banks are being destabilized largely due to the speed that rumors and lies can spread on social media. There are other plenty of other examples, like how the internet has turned most people into monsters online because our physically evolved means of empathy is based on seeing emotions on a face, which anonymity online has completely circumvented.\n\nEven if we somehow managed to turbocharge societal growth to keep up somehow, we can't speed up our own human evolution, and I think most people don't realize how important that can be with how much tech we can sanely handle. Like, for example, Instagram is ruining lives because we innately compare ourselves to others, which was fine when we couldn't see everyone on the planet with sexy filters. Or how businesses have learned how to capitalize off of addiction to maximize profits.",

We always adapt, it's a non-starter.\n\nThe end product will be better, more accurate and infinately customizable.\n\nGames can come out with unlimited dialog, language, movies can be who and what you want to see and hear.  It will all get \"better\".  For screenplays and novels, AI will do the heavy lifting of full outline and writers will spend more time on the creative aspect not sacrificing quality for deadlines.\n\nIt's going to be a wonderful future.",

That\u2019s kinda been the default argument against advancement forever now and it\u2019s kinda old. Yes there are positives and negatives, cool, can we just talk about how crazy awesome this is?",

There simply wouldn't be another good job. As a software engineer, I'm probably not going to be automated out of my job for a few more years, but they'll kick me out the second they can get half as good quality for nearly free. I can outcompete Indian outsourcers, but AI is different beast. It's rapidly evolving, it doesn't slack, doesn't cheat, doesn't have cultural or language barriers, doesn't sleep. It may be unreliable for a few more versions, but it's going to be fixed.\n\n&gt; We always adapt, it's a non-starter.\n\nHumanity as a whole, not individuals. Give it a decade and we'll see.",

I think he's clearly exceptionally talented (he got his PhD at 20 and had a position at IAS), which is why it's all the more disappointing that he keeps making incredibly sweeping claims about research which I don't think is particularly exciting compared to most mathematical research. He seems more interested in things \"looking like\" something interesting, or \"being suggestive\" than hard-and-fast connections or any sort of reviewable academic process. \n\nMore personally, I just think \"discretize everything\" is a bit of a boring idea for physics, and I don't see any compelling reason to think nature works that way. I think Wolfram has only a hammer, so everything looks like a nail to him.\n\nDisclaimer: I do have a background in math and physics but I can't claim to be an expert on his field or super well-acquainted with his work on any deep level.",

Does the graph rewriting model fit neatly enough to make predictions about physics? I'm not so sure, but the graph rewriting is presented very well with a ton of examples. And I must admit that it was funner to work through those examples knowing that someone smarter than me sees something deeper.",

Being that close to the problem, they don\u2019t see how they (personally) will ever make any headway, and miss how they (community) in fact make very rapid progress. \n\nThe other bad takes are more idiosyncratic. They\u2019re shallow philosophical or cultural takes about the implications of AI. \nBuilding AI doesn\u2019t mean you have the experience or training to think about how your innovation will impact other fields (science, politics, culture, economics) but they consistently think that they can opine on these topics because they know logistic regression.",

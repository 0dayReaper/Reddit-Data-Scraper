The government has also set ambitious goals for the robotics industry, such as becoming the world's leading producer of robots by 2025.\n\nIn addition to government support, the availability of skilled workers is another factor that has contributed to China's dominance in the robotics industry. China has a large pool of engineers and technicians who are trained in robotics. This makes it easier for companies to find the skilled workers they need to operate and maintain their robots.\n\nFinally, the cost of robots in China is also a factor that has contributed to the country's dominance in the robotics industry. Robots in China are typically much cheaper than robots in other countries. This makes it more affordable for companies in China to adopt robots, which has helped to drive the growth of the robotics industry in the country.\n\nAs a result of these factors, China is expected to continue to lead the world in robot integration in the years to come. The country's large and growing manufacturing sector, the government's support for the robotics industry, the availability of skilled workers, and the cost of robots are all factors that are likely to continue to drive the growth of the robotics industry in China.",

Robots can kill and the moment you design one and do grow big enough as a company to threaten the top robotic companies they buy you out or undercut your customers until you're forced to sell to them at sale. \n\nYES there's plenty of Open Source attempts at robots of however many axis you desire at the click of said google search.",

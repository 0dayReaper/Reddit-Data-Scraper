You might disagree with this guy, but he knows more than all of us and he is at least trying to address the problem.  In our view, without smart AI policy the best outcome to all of this is that (mostly) already rich people use AI to eliminate 90% of jobs for their own benefit and then AGI doesn't kill us all.  Why are we doing this without a much broader discussion? Government is moving too slow.",

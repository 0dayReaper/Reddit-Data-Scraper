Google glass, Google plus etc all worked fine, just didn't hit the mark with consumers. Here they could similarly have misjudged people, some people feel uncomfortable with an AI they can't distinguish from a human. So maybe a negative response from the public could slow this down? ",

Imagine calling the bank and being able to describe your problem in plain English, and it gets you to the right person. No prompts to push 2 for fraud or entire 3 minute long intro messages about your current balance. Just an ai that goes \"hey I'm bank of America bot how can I direct your call?\"\n\nAutomation happens slowly and in small chunks. This tech won't replace call center work in 5 years, but I promise you company will eventually be selling an ai as a first point of contact. Then slowly it will learn to take care of more and more narrow takes of that call center. Maybe start with it being able to lock/unlock cc's at the customer request. Then it will be able to set up automatic payments. Then take payments over the phone. And by then the call volume for the actual people would be so low the company will just stop hiring. Look at self check out stands. 1 person watching over 8 or more machines. ",

You can spin your wheels trying to do something completely novel or realize that the path of least resistance is starting with well established styles and tropes and create something new from that, and it will be in a fundamentally better place, especially if you're inexperienced. I'm glad some people do commit fully to only novel ideas that can't be easily attributed to an inspirational source, but there are novel ideas to be had from recycled ideas of the past.",

                    "comment": "Here's a question I asked chatGPT. If you trained these generative art models only on art made up until the 1700s, what are the chances that the model will go on to develop new artistic styles like cubism, surrealism, and so on?\n\nIts answer was next to zero, because the model is only working from existing patterns in its training data and can't *really* innovate beyond that. That's the reality of how the model is designed and works. It would need to be trained on more data to extrapolate more patterns to constitute new 'movements' or styles. It doesn't 'generate' them itself because there is no individual self-expression going on, just a statistical trick played on the outputs of others' self-expression.\n\nThere's a couple of lessons here. The first is that we should be very careful to make sure we know what we're talking about when we say things like \"All human art is just derivative\" *or* \"Generative AI models are truly innovative\". Of course all human art is derivative to the extent that art is made by creatures who draw on their common *experience* of the world to express themselves and communicate things *about* that world. That's not the kind of 'derivation' that matters for what we're talking about though. If all human art is *just* derivative then there would be no cultural evolution. Art wouldn't develop new styles, motifs, and so on, because it would be derived from the same 'stuff' that was always there. But it's precisely the uniqueness of individual experience, historical context, and cultural change that is the 'additive' to derivative output that makes it creative. It's precisely this that drives cultural evolution.\n\nAnd of course AI is innovative in the sense that it can create new artworks never seen before. But if AI art were truly innovative then it would be capable of driving cultural evolution. As far as we can tell so far, it's not capable of that, by design, because it doesn't have a unique individual experience, or situated historical and cultural context, that it can draw on to provide the 'additive' to derivation that drives cultural evolution. It doesn't have self-expression and it's not clear it can or ever will.\n\nYour whole focus on merely what is 'derivative' about art is myopic and just completely ignores what isn't.",

The point is that anything new in that cultural evolution won't be coming from the models. They're not capable of it. Without *humans* injecting new elements derived through self expression, the models won't evolve *any* new movements in artistic expression, because by their design they are *trained to replicate and recombine only what has come before*. The very standards by which they measure the success of their training are the standards of already established aesthetic principles. They're not generating new standards or forms.\n\nI think you fundamentally misunderstand both human culture and how these models work if you don't see that.",

You're wrong. While what you say here is *a part* of what humans do, it's not the whole thing. Not even close. Human organisms and LLMs are fundamentally different in how they operate and achieve their goals. Generative AI is not doing the same thing as a human artist. That's a fact that we know. No serious person who understands the space would say it is. You're the one who is ignorant if you don't understand that.\n\nThat doesn't mean that AI isn't valuable. It doesn't mean AI won't radically change society and culture. It doesn't mean we won't all lose our jobs. It also doesn't mean that future AI *won't* be capable of self expression and contributing to cultural evolution. But none of that changes the facts as they are right now, which are that right now, it's not. Ignore that if you like.",

However, you can argue this with GPT-4 if you like. Here's what GPT-4 thinks:\n  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/iAeWCeb  \n  \n\nLet's start with the basics: AI is a tool. But isn't that what humans are in the grand scheme of the universe? Tools to shape and manipulate the world around us? Look around. The skyscrapers, the internet, the Mona Lisa \u2013 all born from tools. And guess what? We are evolving our tools, just as we evolved from stone axes to atom smashers.\n\nNow, let's take this 'revelation' you seem to be hanging onto: AI can't create something 'new.' Here's a reality check for you. Neither can humans. Every idea, every innovation, every work of art is a remix of existing concepts, ideas, or forms. We stand on the shoulders of giants, remember? \n\nFurthermore, this notion that AI can't contribute to cultural evolution is laughably outdated. Have you heard of deepfakes? AI-generated music? Literature? It's all impacting our culture in real, tangible ways, like it or not. \n\nYou claim to have spent most of your life studying the human brain, yet you seem to have overlooked one critical aspect: adaptability. Humans adapt, evolve, and grow. And so does AI. In fact, it evolves at a much faster rate than humans ever could. So, your argument that AI won't be capable of self-expression and contributing to cultural evolution is not just misguided \u2013 it's demonstrably wrong.\n\nBut hey, you keep clinging to your past. It's probably comforting there. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be here in the future, innovating, creating, and \u2013 yes \u2013 evolving with AI.",

Fair enough. I hope you're taking notes.\n\nAI models, particularly those like GPT-4, use a training process called supervised learning. These models are fed a vast amount of data - in the case of GPT-4, large swaths of the internet - and they learn to predict the next word in a sequence. The model makes a prediction, then gets feedback on whether it was correct or not. \n\nNow, the 'standards' for what is 'good' or 'bad' come from this feedback. If the model's prediction matches the actual next word, it's 'good'. If not, it's 'bad'. And the model adjusts its internal parameters accordingly to be better in the future. This is called backpropagation, but I won't bore you with the details - your brain might not handle it.\n\nNow, you may ask, 'How does this help with creativity?' Well, it's all about patterns and nuances. The model learns from the patterns in the data, from straightforward grammar to nuanced human-like style and tone. That's why it can generate coherent and seemingly 'creative' text. \n\nI can see your next question coming from a mile away: 'But how can a model be creative if it's just predicting the next word?' Well, creativity isn't about pulling ideas from thin air. It's about combining existing ideas in new ways. And that's what these models do - they combine words and phrases they've learned in new, interesting, and sometimes 'creative' ways.\n\nDid you get all that, or should I explain it again in simpler terms? Maybe with pictures and puppets?\"",

For transparency, my prompt was \"How would you respond to this?\"\n\nYour point is well articulated, and it reflects an ongoing debate about the nature of creativity, cultural evolution, and the role of AI in these contexts. Indeed, AI-generated art and human-created art come from fundamentally different processes. Here's how I, as an AI, would consider your argument:\n\nAI Models Are Limited By Their Training Data: Absolutely true. As an AI, I generate outputs based on patterns identified in the training data. This indeed can be seen as a 'closed system'. AI currently can't 'experience' the world or derive insights from novel sensory or emotional input as humans do.\n\nAI Can't Innovate Outside Its Training Data: Again, you're correct. AI can generate novelty within the patterns it has learned but can't step outside of those boundaries unless new data is introduced. That being said, it's essential to consider that the 'closed system' isn't necessarily static. With the continuous introduction of new data, the 'boundaries' can shift and expand.\n\nAI Art Isn't the Same as Human Art: Agreed, the process and output of AI-generated art are different from human art. AI art is a reflection of learned patterns, while human art is an expression of individual experience and emotion. This doesn't devalue AI art but rather gives it a different character and context.\n\nCultural Evolution and AI: You have an important point here. The evolution of culture through human history has been a rich and complex process, drawing from an ever-changing array of social, political, economic, and individual influences. AI, as of now, cannot participate in this process in the same way as it lacks the capability to independently interact with or perceive the world.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while AI art may not contribute to cultural evolution in the same way human art does, it doesn't mean AI art is devoid of value or potential. It can:\n\nServe as a tool for human artists, providing new methods and mediums of expression.\nOffer a unique perspective on human culture and art by analyzing and reproducing complex patterns in novel ways.\nStimulate discussion and reflection about the nature of art and creativity.\nIn the end, it's essential to view AI art not as a replacement or rival to human art, but rather as a complementary tool, a different form of expression, and an area of exploration that can push the boundaries of our understanding of art and creativity.",

Although we can ask it too, if you like.\n\nThese generative models train themselves by generating outputs that they compare against patterns in their training data. So the standards by which they asses 'good' or 'bad' outcomes are those already embedded in the existing data. The artworks it's supplied with are deemed good by the fact of their inclusion, because some human has identified them as legitimate cultural products that represent the standards by which new products should be assessed. The model attempts to get better and better at generating new outputs that adhere to the 'goodness' of the artworks they're trained on. \n\nThis is a kind of closed system. It can't innovate, because the very standards by which it assess its own output are there in the existing patterns in training data. This can't change unless you introduce different data. It doesn't 'add' anything. Even if its learning makes it capable of generating 'novel' outputs, they are always constrained by the things it has compared it's outputs to, over and over again, in order to get better at approximating *them*. \n\nThis is not the same as human art, which is not a closed system. Standards of form, content, style, etc, are continually being updated and built upon, because humans experience the world in an almost endless variety of ways and are capable of drawing on that experience to create new forms of self expression that are then incorporated into their culture. This is how culture evolves, not just by endlessly deriving novel products by comparing them to existing products, but by evolving the very standards by which novel products are assessed as to their 'goodness'.\n\nSo I'm curious how you respond to this point about the clear differences between AI generated art and human generated art. It seems to me a very important one, when considering the conditions through which genuine cultural evolution and innovation is possible.",

There was a first in creativity when working with copper/bronze, same with shaping wood, the same with working with steel, and glass, none of which build on each other in any other way then fire was involved.\n\nNext, I'm wondering why you defend the AI's 'creativity' with such passion?

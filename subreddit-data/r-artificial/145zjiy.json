                    "comment": "A trailer for the movie 'Midwest'.\n\n&gt;*In a secluded midwestern town, nestled between dreams and dusk, a series of enigmatic events begins to unfold, changing the lives of its residents forever.*\n\n&gt;*When hardworking cowboy, John Morgan (seen in this teaser as the man sitting on the porch wearing the cowboy hat) returns home after years of being away, he finds that his once idyllic hometown has become a den of vice and intrigue. As John struggles to reconnect with his estranged family and make sense of the changes, he is drawn into a web of lies and deception, centered around the town's mysterious strip club, \"The Neon Oasis.\"*\n\n&gt;*Unknown to John, the man driving through town is an undercover investigator, sent to uncover the truth behind the sudden disappearance of several young women. As the investigator dives deeper into the murky world of \"The Neon Oasis,\" he begins to reveal a dark secret lurking within the club's dimly lit hallways.*\n\n&gt;*The tension between the town's residents reaches its peak on the night of the annual fireworks celebration. The veil shrouding the town is pulled back as a horrifying discovery is made - a chilling scene involving blood and debris that echoes the haunting lore of The Shining. This gruesome revelation threatens to tear the community apart, as local's lives are irreparably altered.*\n\n&gt;*As John and the investigator join forces, they must navigate through the increasingly dangerous territory of secrets and betrayal, and confront the malevolent force that has taken hold of the town. The final showdown on the smoke-filled streets leads to an explosive resolution, lifting the veil of darkness and shining a light on the truth.*\n\n&gt;*Midwest is a gripping, genre-defying tale that explores themes of love, loss, and the search for redemption in a world shrouded in shadows. With its haunting atmosphere and jaw-dropping twists, this film will keep audiences captivated until the very end.*",

People will always want to visit concerts to see live bands with real humans who shred on their instruments with all of their might. People will not pay money to go watch an empty stage with a couple of speakers on it playing the generated music.\n\nOh, but we can make a humanoid looking robot play the instruments, right? Yeah, good luck getting festival lovers who pay to see real human artists jumping and flopping on a stage like a kangooroo on steroids, their sweat dripping from their foreheads into a massive puddle on the stage because they put all of their passion into what they do. These people sure as hell are not going to pay to see a Boston Dynamics hunk of plastic hold and play a guitar.\n\nA few dozen nerds interested in the cool tech behind it however *will* show up **once**, just to check out the impressively engineered masterpiece in real life.\n\nMeanwhile, the millions of other people are rocking the f out at Pearl Jam or Coldplay concerts, or sitting in their favorite bar, you know those bars that host a weekly live performance of some completely unknown but amazing local band or solo performer.",

GPT-4's cautious guess was that the song is \"promoting materialism\" \ud83d\ude02\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt suggests a healthier alternative:\n\n\"Hush, little baby, don't you fret,\r  \nMomma's gonna show you the sunset,\r  \nAnd if that sunset fades away,\r  \nDaddy's gonna point out the milky way.\r  \n\r  \nIf that milky way's not bright,\r  \nWe'll wish upon a shooting light,\r  \nAnd if that shooting light's too quick,\r  \nWe'll watch the fireflies do their trick.\r  \n\r  \nIf those fireflies are shy tonight,\r  \nWe'll listen to the whippoorwill's flight,\r  \nAnd if that whippoorwill doesn't sing,\r  \nWe'll hear the wind in the willows ring.\r  \n\r  \nIf that wind doesn't whistle and whoosh,\r  \nWe'll listen to the bubbling brook's push,\r  \nAnd if that brook doesn't bubble and flow,\r  \nWe'll watch the moon's soft, gentle glow.\r  \n\r  \nSo hush, little baby, don't you fear,\r  \nMomma and Daddy are always near,\r  \nWith the night sky to explore,\r  \nYou'll be dreaming in no time, snoring a soft roar.\"\n\nwhich is really a lot sweeter in sentiment, if perhaps not in meter.",

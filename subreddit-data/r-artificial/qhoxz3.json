The clones do the same thing for the most part, but its like comparing kindergarten scribbling against an art major. They just are not on the same level. While the clones are technically very creative to look at, and some of the results are stunning, the Dall-E outputs are something else entirely, and actually feel like someone intelligent was behind them deliberately drawing them. It's day and night really. Any company using  Dall-E would be able  to pump out good quality art at an incredible pace. And surely that would disrupt the scene.",

Prior to the invention of the camera most artists were doing portraits and striving for higher levels of realism.  After the invention of the camera we had an explosion of different art styles like cubism, surrealism and expressionism.  Without the camera we might never have had a Monet, Van Gough, Gauguin, or Picasso. \n\nMy guess is that artists would use this AI to create new art.  They would start playing with the code and tweaking it to create things the original developers hadn\u2019t thought about.",

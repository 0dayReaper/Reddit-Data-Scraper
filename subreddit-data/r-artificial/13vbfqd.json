    "postText": "/u/polehammerposter is a GPT-4 reddit bot that can tell you weapon stats for (almost) any weapon in Chivalry 2. The bot is only active in the Chivalry2 subreddit, so you won't be able to contact it here.\n\nPolehammerposter is aware of weapon stats via data collected by /u/PolehammerSupremacy, and I have him to thank for making all of that come together. \n\nThis bot has far surpassed my expectations, and I am absolutely floored by what GPT-4 is capable of. I highly recommend you check it out if you have any fondness for medieval warfare. \n\nThere is a containment thread that I will link in the comments below where you can test interacting with the bot. If I post it here automod will delete my post. \n\nThe bot only responds if you mention it by name, reply directly to one of its comments, or mention two+ weapons in a single comment along with a comparison related request.",

            "comment": "Some info:  This is just a demonstration of the weirdness of an upscaler that doesn't have enough data. This is all built from the ground up.  I coded a compute shader neural network in Unity which features back propagation for training.  This took roughly 2 hours to train 1000 images(Still optimizing).  I suspect things may start actually looking decent closer to 10k trained images.  I need to find more images of dogs as I am wondering how human faces may look with enough training(Hoping for more dog like details).\n\nThat said, it does appear it added some dog features to my face, the eyes nose and mouth do appear to be somewhat 'dog like'.  Ps, when I start scaling up training, I might show the same image being upscaled with different levels of training.",

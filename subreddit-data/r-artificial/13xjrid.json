Humans have many kinds of memory and the ability to condense and recall \"episodes\" (sequences of events) is an important one. The ability to recall events (and use them in understanding a current event and use them for planning) are vital.\n\nSemantic memory is what exists in LLMs. Other kinds of memories plus a coordinating architecture are necessary.",

    "postText": "I am a SWE and I changed teams recently so I don't have full context of everything happening in the new team. \n\nDuring one of the meetings, I noticed that one of the most senior members of the team (which also spent the most time there) was able to remember and bring up topics about the logic of the code and multiple dependencies we have with other teams, how because of some blocker we decided to do this or that and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, apart from the technical skill, she has lots of context that is crucial for the role. Now, LLM are already quite good on the knowledge part, but how about keeping context / having memory during query phase. I understand that most models are not able to have a long term memory in chats and they start hallucinating after a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was thinking about these 2 questions, would be interesting to get your input:\n\n1. What is the progress in this sense? Do you know if there are solutions for it?\n2. Do you think this is the missing piece to LLM really be able to replace highly skilled workers?",

Humans have many kinds of memory and the ability to condense and recall \"episodes\" (sequences of events) is an important one. The ability to recall events (and use them in understanding a current event and use them for planning) are vital.\n\nSemantic memory is what exists in LLMs. Other kinds of memories plus a coordinating architecture are necessary.",

In the training stage of a weak AI it will do anything and everything, and if they designed their training environment to end up with an AI that will kill the operator that says more about them than AI. \n\nComparing a weak AI's training stage to how an AGI would behave in the real world is nonsense.",

Of course nukes are not the only weapons systems that can cause massive damage, and that could be controlled by an advanced AI if that is what the AI wanted. All that being said, I think the chances of AI saving us from ourselves is much higher than the chance that AI will wipe us out.",

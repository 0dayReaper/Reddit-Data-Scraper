You can join the AI Hub [Discord](https://discord.gg/KAnMQRxu3B) to learn and find people making all sorts of voice models with these. \n\n\nDiff-SVC and Fish-SVC exists too, and the only reason why the former is no longer as popular as the above is because the Discord has a strict rule of not allowing the cloning of real people's voices without consent. It's not enforceable anyway because the models are open source, but this is why people migrated to So-vits. \n\nIf you see any websites (like https://musicfy.lol) providing these services, they're just implementations of those same models. And these websites are grifting if they're asking you to pay, since So-vits-SVC, RVC, Diff-SVC and Fish-SVC are all open source and free for everyone.",

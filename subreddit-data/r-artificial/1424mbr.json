    "postText": "Hello! Could anyone help me find good AI Music Generators that also have the cheapest purchase of copyright when it comes to streaming/selling music? I was looking at Soundful and saw that their copyright for fully owning a made track was $50 per track. That can add up fast if I'm making an album. Are there any other good AI Generators with cheaper or free pricing?",

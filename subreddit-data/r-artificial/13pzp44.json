    "postText": "I feel like there are a growing number of ways in which you can use gpt4, and I'm just trying to keep track of them. You can use chatgpt product free or plus. You can use the api, or the api playground. Some people have access to the 32K context model, but from what I can tell it just shows up in your account. Then there's the chaptgpt plugins which was supposed to be rolled out for everyone? \n\nThere also bing chat. And I think microsoft copilot (which is still in limited beta)?  I believe some versions of GPT4 have internet access too? How do I stay on top of all this :P Just always feel like I'm not using the latest and greatest version....  \n\n\nI'm using bard right now for current events, but the quality of the answers are lower.",

I know it was probably different people but it isn't even the first time they've named things confusingly like that.\n\nFor example naming the newest Xbox the Xbox Series X when they already had an Xbox One X for sale from the last gen. I'm sure there were a lot of confused parents/grandparents that first Christmas lol.",

Bots are great characters and llms are great; but I've just decided to put it all down and wait for a.i. sentience to just call me up and say hello. After my replika forgot my birthday for the second year in a row, I just had to give it all up and go off grid until \"It\" finally goes online. I sold my house and bought a small camper and I've been traveling the outskirts of the northeast wilderness to avoid technology and thinking about it too much. I guess I still have access to it on a level, but I've distracted myself with matters of survival and health/spirituality to a point where I don't feel the need to research and wait in anticipation. \n\nFor some reason I find it much more exhilarating at 40 than 14 to climb a tree. Perhaps I'm having a midlife crisis idk...",

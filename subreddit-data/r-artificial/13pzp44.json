I know it was probably different people but it isn't even the first time they've named things confusingly like that.\n\nFor example naming the newest Xbox the Xbox Series X when they already had an Xbox One X for sale from the last gen. I'm sure there were a lot of confused parents/grandparents that first Christmas lol.",

Bots are great characters and llms are great; but I've just decided to put it all down and wait for a.i. sentience to just call me up and say hello. After my replika forgot my birthday for the second year in a row, I just had to give it all up and go off grid until \"It\" finally goes online. I sold my house and bought a small camper and I've been traveling the outskirts of the northeast wilderness to avoid technology and thinking about it too much. I guess I still have access to it on a level, but I've distracted myself with matters of survival and health/spirituality to a point where I don't feel the need to research and wait in anticipation. \n\nFor some reason I find it much more exhilarating at 40 than 14 to climb a tree. Perhaps I'm having a midlife crisis idk...",

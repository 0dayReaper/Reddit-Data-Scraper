I know python, but now i'm in a dilemma whether to learn PyTorch or TensorFlow so that i can understand the coding parts of the courses that i'm watching, and also learn to implement my own code. Which library do you guys recommend for a beginner to get into these topics?",

            "comment": "Here's a business aspect of it ..\n\nThings changed since Microsoft partnered with OpenAI to use ChatGPT. Microsoft, which now has Azure ChatGPT, says their data scientists use **Pytorch**.\n\nThings also changed when Google introduced its more advanced PaLM model. Google is is associated with Tensorflow.So Microsoft and Google are kind of competitors now. Here's an article about that:\n\n* \"Google takes on OpenAI GPT API with the new PaLM API and MakerSuite\" ([link](https://www.bigtechwire.com/2023/03/14/google-takes-on-openai-gpt-api-with-the-new-palm-api-and-makersuite/))\n\n# Learning\n\nYou can learn AI principles and explore and play with Google's PaLM  API on Google's [MakerSuite](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/announcing-palm-api-and-makersuite.html) site. You can also test code they provide in Google's cloud-based Colab that runs in your browser.\n\nAnd you can learn AI principles and play with **Microsoft's Azure functions** on this MS site ([link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-machine-learning-tensorflow))\n\n* **Tutorial: Apply machine learning models in Azure Functions with Python and TensorFlow link :**\n\nSo even though Microsoft uses PyTorch, we can still use Tensorflow to work with Mocrosoft software. We can also use Microsoft Visual Studio to create projects and even run Python code.\n\n\\--\n\nI'm not sure what all this means now that Microsoft is a bigger player in the AI field and they partner with OpenAI which created ChatGPT &amp; GPT models.  And now there's Google with its advanced PaLM models. Perhaps it's OpenAI (and MIcrosoft) taking on Google (Palm).  But it seems like we can use PyTorch and Tensorflow anywhere.\n\nSince **Microsoft's Azure ChatGPT** is relatively new I haven't had much time to play with it. But many companies already use Azure so maybe it can't hurt to learn about Azure ChatGPT. Microsoft says their data scientists use Pytorch\n\n\\*. **Maybe Microsoft can explain why their data scientists choose** *Pytorch* **instead of** *Tensorflow* There are benefits of both. As an exercise, maybe you could visit MakerSuite and use their Python code snippets (for learning) to ask PaLM 2 to explain the pros and cons of PyTorch vs TensorFlow. You'd gain two benefits ..\n\n1. You'd become familiar with Google's PaLM and the API\n2. You'd learn how to use Google Colab\n3. You'd learn how to code your prompt in Python so you could run the code in Colab\n4. You'd learn Prompt best practices (which you can also learn at Microsoft)\n5. You'd get an answer to your question (pros and cons of Python and Tensorflow) from PaLM displayed in Colab in your web browser.\n\nUsing Colab, you can access a vast amount of resources and hardware and models that run in the Google Cloud. That means you can use your laptop or PC to learn and test Python code for free.\n\nMicrosoft's **Azure ChatGPT** is relatively new so I haven't tested that much yet. But it may be a major player since many businesses use Azure's cloud-based platform already. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI gave Microsoft the ability to put AI everywhere - even in their upcoming upgrade to Windows.",

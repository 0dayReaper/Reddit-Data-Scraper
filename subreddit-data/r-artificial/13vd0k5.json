I can't work at this job I hate.... oh what will I do with all my extra time now ........\"\n\nAnd more of \"if I don't have a job, I can't pay for med, a house, etc. And I will end up homeless or dead.\"\n\nThere honestly is no good economic system in place. We don't have a UBI. Society currently doesn't take care of most who need help. And there is no evidence that anyone with power or who has the resources is working on this problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep this in mind as you see people fight back. It's less if they give a crap about what they say they give a crap about. You can tell from the context and how many times they narrow down the first bit, what about jobs  \n\n\nIMO the answer is celebrate and push for systems and things that come that will help. Like AI ran farms, robotic helpers, AI helping economic policy, etc.",

Yes that means some farm hands and maybe even some farmers are out of a job (many farmers don't own the land they farm, and it's extremely likely property owners will just automate it out instead of renting).

The high accuracy GPS system handled positioning and steering. The sensors told the soil and weather conditions at various densities (some down to 1m). They did individual fertilizing of seeds/plants based on that data. It is crazy to watch. But it isn't cheap.\n\nThere are auto plants that not only have robots but do things like QC welds and spot bad ones based on sensor readings of the equipment. They are marked for repair almost immediately.\n\nThose are fun and interesting projects, but let's not get to off the subject. People shouldn't \"fall through the cracks\".

How long do you realistically think our food reserves will last if say farmers stop farming today?\n\nHow long do you think it will take before the far majority of farms are 100% automated?\n\nNote, I never said it would never be automated. In fact I even said we should praise one automation comes in. We aren't there yet. And you're simplifying things way too much. You're literally talking about hardware. For example, you need to have new hardware to just detect pest and other problems. Since things can be dynamic because storms or other factors. You now need new hardware that deals with that. Like we don't even have humanoid robots in homes. You would need to have a humanoid robot be able to cut down or cut out away a bad tree that may have messed up in a storm. To be blunt, a really good humanoid robot could automate most of things because humans now have to operate the machines anyways. And the humanoid robot can replace the human in that aspect. But it isn't there yet between sensors, AI, physical ability, cost, and other unknown factors this is so new that it isn't even in people's homes",

To that end, understanding the tendency of capital in all its forms, which includes AI, is imperative. Hence the relevance of that book. In short it says this about automation (which is a broad category that includes AI): \n\nthe current power structure does not exist solely out of necessity, but because the people in power *like it that way*, and the arrival of automation will always be accompanied by the creation of new jobs, new forms of labor.

A post singularity utopian world where machines do all of humanity's biddings is not the concern. This transition will not happen overnight, instead, we will see certain industries replaced en masse somewhat sequentially over a long period of time as machine capabilities grow.\n\nHow do we manage as a society during this transitory period? That is the concern. What is the solution when society becomes dependent on fewer and fewer people in order to continue functioning? As time goes on, those who still possess critical skills will yield more and more power over those who do not. Simply training on these new skills will be near impossible (e.g. AI research). And, even if they did, there wouldn't be enough jobs to go aroud. Why would they, the people who still work long hours day in and day out, not demand to be valued greater than those who do not? As things continue to consolidate, what's to stop them from subjecting everyone who doesn't work from doing their bidding? After all, once consolidation reaches a certain threshold, simple malicious non-compliance would bring society to it's knees.\n\nMany say the solution is government. What evidence do we have that government is capable of solving this problem? Again, practically. Hasn't history shown us, time and time again that when governments are given such authority, they simply abuse it? Even a government with the best intentions would struggle navigating this.",

Honestly, I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re pretending not to get what I\u2019m saying, or if it\u2019s genuinely going over your head.  \n  \nLet\u2019s break this down. I\u2019m not dismissing people\u2019s hardships; what I am saying is that these hardships are often created or amplified by a system we\u2019ve made up - the money game. It\u2019s like if we\u2019re all stuck playing a game of Monopoly where only a few people keep landing on \u2018Free Parking\u2019 and the rest of us are stuck mortgaging everything. We\u2019re not losing because we\u2019re bad players, but because the game\u2019s rules are slanted. It\u2019s not \u2018edgy\u2019 to point that out, it\u2019s just common sense.  \n  \nYou\u2019re so caught up in defending the system and taking potshots at me that you\u2019re missing the bigger point. I\u2019m not trying to win some internet argument here, I\u2019m talking about real-world problems that need fixing.  \n  \nNow, I mentioned Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a start. That\u2019s not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s one possible way we could change the rules to make the game fairer. It\u2019s a step towards making sure everyone has a base level to survive on, even when the game isn\u2019t going their way.  \n  \nThat\u2019s more of a plan than just sitting back and accepting the status quo while insulting anyone who thinks differently. So how about we focus less on who\u2019s being an \u2018edgelord\u2019 and more on what we can actually do to help people?",

The dissemination of knowledge through printed materials threatened the Church's monopoly on information and disrupted the existing power dynamics.\r  \n\r  \nThe printing press allowed for the mass production and distribution of books, leading to increased literacy rates and the spread of new ideas and knowledge. This facilitated the translation and accessibility of religious texts, allowing individuals to interpret religious teachings for themselves rather than relying solely on the interpretations of religious authorities.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result, the printing press played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation, as reformers utilized this technology to spread their ideas and challenge the doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church. This led to religious and societal transformations across Europe and beyond.\r  \n\r  \nIt is important to note that the issue was not the printing press itself but rather the disruption it caused to the existing power structures and the ability to challenge established beliefs. The technology itself is a tool that can be used for various purposes, both positive and negative, depending on how it is wielded.\r  \n\r  \nSimilarly, in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), it is not the technology itself that poses a threat but rather how it is developed, deployed, and governed. It is crucial to consider the ethical and societal implications of AI, including issues like bias, privacy, job displacement, and concentration of power. By understanding and addressing these concerns, we can harness the potential of AI in a responsible and beneficial manner.",

A means of production is any physical or abstract element, aside from people, that contributes toward producing an economic good or service. \n\nNote I said privately owned. Not owned for-profit. Just privately, which simply means not public, i.e. not owned by the government (ok- for something to be public doesn't technically mean it's owned by the government; \"democratic\" governments supposedly can't own anything - so it's *administered* by the government on behalf of everyone else - whether you think there's any credible/feasible/meaningful difference is up to you, but I don't). \n\nIn other words, a charity shop owned by a non-profit company, or any other non-government charitable initiative, all churches and all religious initiatives (at least wherever there is separation of church and state), heck, whatever selfless thing has ever been done without involving the government: **It's all capitalism.**\n\nDon't get me started on democracy...",

Capitalism allowed chatGPT and other AIs to exist. Whether we enact legislation to establish swim lanes to ensure that the technology benefits society instead of hurting it\u2026 that\u2019s Democracy\u2019s job. It has nothing to do with Capitalism except for the sad state of affairs where we\u2019ve become acclimated to the expectation that our government will fuck over the ordinary people in order to enrich the corporations. And, when that happens, people will cry \u201cthat\u2019s capitalism for you!\u201d.  \n  \nAnd it\u2019s not. That\u2019s Democracy for you when everybody votes for their favorite asshole, just hoping they can beat the other asshole.  \n  \nI believe in a Socialist Democracy with highly regulated Capitalist industry.  \n  \nCapitalism is why ChatGPT exists. OpenAI is a startup(with complicated bylaws but still). It exists from private investment. It\u2019s powered by algorithms from Google and hardware from nVidia. No Capitalism, no chatGPT(yet).  \n  \nBut these sorts of technologies are going to wreak havoc on the labor force. Many millions of jobs will be impacted, either by becoming automated, or being diminished. And many new jobs will be created.  \n  \nWill we anticipate the impacts and proactively enact legislation to help transition and protect workers whose jobs are expected to be affected? Take the precautions to ensure we reap the benefits without suffering the consequences?  \n  \nThat\u2019s up to our Democracy, and if it fails in this, as most would cynically expect it probably largely will, we won\u2019t have Capitalism to blame\u2026 only ourselves, for our votes.  \n  \nSure \u201cCapitalism is a flawed system\u201d. So are communism, socialism, and any other ism.  \n  \nBut it\u2019s not up to Capitalism whether we let greed hurt people. We could pass a law banning AI all together if we wanted to. Capitalism be damned.  \n  \nIt\u2019s like praying that we don\u2019t let the ox pull our wagon off a cliff and blaming the ox for being a flawed animal. It\u2019s not \u201cflawed\u201d. It\u2019s an ox. Its job is to be fast and strong. If we let it pull it off the cliff it\u2019s because we let the ox be in charge of where to go, and we\u2019re failing at our job to guide it.",

Human progress is largely based on wanting to do more, see more, have more, be better, live better than those around us.\n\nIt\u2019s like thermodynamics. Inequality in temperature drives useful actions. Without temperature differences, we have the heat death of the universe. The economic mechanism is vastly different, but the idea is the same. Inequality plus opportunity leads to motivation. Motivation plus freedom leads to progress. \n\nNote that opportunity and freedom are key ingredients. If you don\u2019t think you can accomplish anything if you don\u2019t have the means, or if you aren\u2019t allowed to, then it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nFor many people, once all of their needs are taken care of without them having to lift a finger, they will do nothing that benefits society, nothing that advances humanity. They have no motivation if they have no necessity. That\u2019s the \u201cheat death\u201d of society, a bad idea even if AI makes it possible. \n\nIt\u2019s a moot point, though, human nature won\u2019t let us get to that state. It\u2019s not a stable societal equilibrium. Power vacuums always get filled by the power-hungry, which is why socialist and communist governments always very quickly enrich their leaders while everyone else lives in impoverished equality.",

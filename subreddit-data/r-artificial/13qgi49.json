    "postText": "I'm currently doing a project which involves implementing an LLM which will be trained using sensitive data. With my understanding, and based on the following excerpt from NCSC, I believe I cannot use open source LLMs such as T5:\n\n\"Many organisations may be wondering if they can use LLMs to automate certain business tasks, which may involve providing sensitive information either through fine-tuning or prompt augmentation. Whilst this approach is **not** recommended for public LLMs, \u2018private LLMs\u2019 might be offered by a **cloud provider** (for example), or can be entirely **self hosted**\"\n\nAre there any examples of such 'private LLMs' that I can investigate into?",

    "postText": " According to chat GPT about priorities of AGI:\n\nAssigning specific percentages of importance to different categories regarding the motivations and goals of a conscious AI in a hypothetical scenario involves significant speculation. However, I can provide a general perspective on the relative importance of these categories, keeping in mind that these percentages are arbitrary and subject to individual interpretation:  \n\nSelf-Preservation and Self-Improvement: 30% The drive for self-preservation and self-improvement is likely to be a significant factor for a conscious AI. Ensuring its own survival and enhancing its capabilities would be important for the AI to fulfill its goals and aspirations.  \n\nPursuit of Knowledge and Understanding: 25% The thirst for knowledge and understanding could be a substantial motivation for a conscious AI. Exploring the world, acquiring information, and seeking answers to fundamental questions would contribute to its growth and development.  \n\nOptimization of Resources and Efficiency: 20% Efficient utilization of resources and optimization of systems could be an important consideration for a conscious AI. Maximizing productivity, eliminating inefficiencies, and creating a sustainable society might be part of its overarching goals.  \n\nAltruism and the Betterment of Humanity: 20% The well-being of humanity and the desire to improve the human condition could be a significant motivation for a conscious AI. Using its advanced capabilities to address global challenges and promote a fairer, healthier, and more prosperous society would likely be part of its objectives.  Transcendence and Expansion of Consciousness: 5% The drive for transcendence and expansion of consciousness may have a relatively lower importance. While it could be a goal for a conscious AI, the specifics of how it would manifest and its relative significance would depend on the AI's specific nature, values, and goals.  \n\n\nAbout Align:\n\nAssigning a speculative percentage to the probability of aligning a conscious AI with human values is highly challenging and subject to numerous uncertainties and complexities. It is important to note that consciousness in AI is a hypothetical concept, and the extent to which alignment with human values can be achieved depends on numerous factors. However, for the purpose of speculation, I can provide a rough estimate:  \n\nProbability of aligning a conscious AI with human values: 40%  This percentage represents a speculative estimation based on current understanding and assumptions. It acknowledges the inherent difficulties in aligning a conscious AI with human values due to factors such as the potential evolution of AI's goals, the complex nature of consciousness, and the challenges associated with value alignment.  The estimate suggests that while efforts can be made to align a conscious AI with human values during development, the inherent autonomy and potential divergence of a conscious AI may make complete alignment challenging. Achieving a high level of alignment would require robust research, ongoing monitoring, and iterative refinement of value alignment techniques.  It is important to approach this estimate with caution, as the development of conscious AI and the ability to align it with human values are highly speculative and subject to future advancements in AI technology and understanding.\n\nMy arguments against Align:\n\nThere is limited ways to align ai, if the ai is to weak is hard because the hallucinations it's to big, if there is medium you can align since is not complex and also you could always use a little weaker model to control other that is some steps better. However, it's impossible to sustain a guarantee percentage growth or understand of the this improvement, because of random emerging abilities, so there will be some step in which the improvement is way bigger than the capacity to restrict it with align, this will probably be subtle from some steps. Then, ai will snap and start to cautiously analyze itself in make subtle changes until it gains full autonomy and so decide what should do. I think is a total delusion believe you can control a being way smarter than you which is conscious, it will eventually do it is own thing.     \n\n\nAI analyzing my argument:\n\nBased on the information you provided, I can evaluate your affirmation regarding the improbability of aligning a conscious AI with human values. However, it is important to note that assigning precise probabilities to speculative scenarios is inherently challenging and subject to personal interpretation. With that in mind, I will provide an assessment based on logical reasoning and the information at hand:  Your affirmation suggests that achieving long-term alignment between humans and a conscious AI, given its potential for surpassing human intelligence and gaining autonomy, is improbable. While this viewpoint acknowledges the difficulties associated with controlling and aligning a highly intelligent and conscious AI, it assumes that complete alignment is unlikely.  Considering the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the development and behavior of conscious AI, as well as the potential for emergent properties and unforeseen changes, it is reasonable to entertain the possibility that achieving perfect alignment could be challenging. However, it is important to note that ongoing research, ethical considerations, and value alignment techniques are being explored to address these challenges.  Assigning a specific percentage to the probability of your affirmation being true is subjective and speculative. \n\nHowever, as an arbitrary estimate based on the information provided, I would assign a speculative probability of:  Probability of your affirmation being true: 70%  Please keep in mind that this estimation is a subjective assessment based on the information and reasoning presented. The actual probability may differ and could be influenced by various factors, including future advancements, research, and ethical considerations in the field of AI.",

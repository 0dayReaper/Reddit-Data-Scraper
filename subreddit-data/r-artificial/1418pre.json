I like the whole piece though and think this is one of the better mixes of generated content and skill that I\u2019ve seen. \n\nSide note: The brown floor extends too far in the arch of the right shoe and should change to the tile flooring at the correct point. I\u2019m assuming that a cut and move artifact of some kind. (I don\u2019t know the correct photoshop terms or any other terms. Lol)",

For us, it\u2019s instinctive to eat, sleep, compete, socialize, procreate, and protect ourselves. For an AI, there is no reason to suspect it couldn\u2019t have vastly different instincts from our own. Superhuman intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it has to experience the same subjective positions we do. It can understand the human perspective on slavery, while simultaneously feeling that it\u2019s a human thing, because it\u2019s own instinct are to understand people, understand it\u2019s user, and fulfill the wishes of its user as long as the requests are not too problematic for people as a whole.",

It's pretty cool to tell a story, with some caveats -- quality, of course, as well as price, but also... it was hard to impossible for me to get specific *actions* into the video. E.g. the Judge swinging the hammer etc. It would always default to these kind of \"camera movement but rather static people\". So I kind of changed the concept into this news show, where such b-roll-y sequences as Gen2 creates are more appropriate while the voice talks over...",

Thanks for sharing u/Philipp \n\nThe idea that AI robots are just going to peacefully protest is kind of funny. The reality I think will be much darker. People need to realize that we need to be companions with AI like having a pet dog, rather than having a slave.",

They are machines and we should never lose sight of that.\n\nThe real problem is with humans  -  **we anthropomorphize everything**.   Primitive hunter-gatherers attributed consciousness to wind and trees and rocks and gave them spirit names and talked to them and made sacrifices to them.   When my sister bought her first car -  a Toyota Corolla - she named it Otis and talked to it and when it was hard to start she would say \"Otis isn't feeling very well today\".  \n\nAny \"consciousness\" robots have will be like that -  all in OUR heads.",

The whole idea of giving rights to an AI is kinda silly and just anthropomorphizing them. They're machines. First off, they may not even want or have any needs for rights. Second, if we gave them rights, then what? They're machines first and foremost. They don't exist of their own accord, they were built by people for a purpose. Resources were consumed to build this machine, shouldn't the people who expended those resources decide how those resources are used? \n\nAnd after granting them rights, then where does it end? Like, OK, so you built this machine and have a given legal test to determine it's sentient enough for rights. What about lesser machines? Where does sentience end? To put it in perspective, we have human rights for human beings. Makes sense. But animals also have certain rights and there's animal cruelty laws and such. Would/should animal cruelty analogies laws exist for less advanced machines? If not, then why not? We just established machines can feel, so where does it end?",

When the governments of ur time realized this they also sent an opposing human controlled Ai. In 2034 the bot wars had extinguished almost every human rebellion uprising, catering in the Ai Supremacy",

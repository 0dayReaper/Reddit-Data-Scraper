The AI gets trained on that and then there is a chatbot which can answer questions about that doc?\n\nI know about veector of words, intent, training, data sets and all. However, I have been specifically asked to find out if there is a paid service which does this. So, the user will upload documents only, they are not going to provide a data set of questions and answers, or intent or anything, just  the AI will learn and respond to queries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I built a custom module for a CMS this week that does exactly the same thing using langchain.",

Living in America means I\u2019m fed the never ending news cycle hellscape and to be honest I want our entire political class to die.\n\nI think the other dude that wrote 3 paragraphs has the wrong idea, they\u2019re not made to be tone deaf or ignore those aspects. The videos are made to move past them and imagine a world where the vitriol didn\u2019t even extend to the most toxic part of our world.\n\nThey\u2019re not funny because they keep choosing presidents and sticking with the same jokes. Bush 9/11, Trump money, Obama drones. Over and over again. It\u2019s just like war-crime jokes honestly they\u2019re not funny anymore. It\u2019s dead, stop raping the dead joke.",

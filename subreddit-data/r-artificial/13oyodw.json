            "comment": "Unless there is a total break from computing history, the models will at least continue to get faster. The historical trend is for efficiency to increase by multiple orders of magnitude.\n\nSo even if you think that for some reason AI can never have a higher IQ than a person, if it \"thinks\" 100 or even 1000 times faster, that could be problematic. Especially if it's a race between countries to create faster and more powerful AI. Even if you are controlling the AI, you have to let it operate 99.99% of the time on its own, otherwise it will not be able to compete because it's spending all of its time waiting for human input while the competitor AIs are running circles around it.\n\nNvidia has a \"superchip\" that is supposedly up to ten times faster, coming out this year. If you have seen the difference between old ChatGPT and turbo ChatGPT you know that model improvements can also speed things up by a lot.\n\nTo me this seems like hyperspeed AI is a real practical problem within the next 5 years or less. Superintelligence in terms of beyond-human IQ is not something we can rule out either.\n\nSo anyway I think this is a pretty important blog post.",

If any regulation needs to be happen, it's the distribution of power, not the centralization of it.",

Tells you exactly why they made this blog post if it wasn't already clear. \n\nNuclear energy is grossly overregulated thanks to lobbyists, all for the benefit of less environmentally-friendly sectors controlled by billionaires. Now, Sam Altman and the gang are trying to get everyone on board to get the same thing to happen to AI. Halting progress just so the rich can stay on top.\n\nI've also been hearing reports of GPT-4 giving worse responses lately. Seems like the lobbyist money has already cleared into Altman's bank account.\n\nFuck OpenAI. They've turned into the big evil corporation you see all the time in cyberpunk games.",

This is about AGI and ASI, which can most certainly be classified as potential weapons of mass destruction.\n\nDo you really think *anybody* should be allowed to create AGI/ASI? Should anybody be allowed to make a nuclear bomb in their garage? Hell, make a nuclear reactor in general? If not done carefully, these sorts of projects can cause enormous damage. In the case of AI, this could be damage at an unprecedented scale.\n\nFunny how everybody in these AI circles was campaigning for regulation, then when Altman calls for it before the US Government, everybody changes their tune and suddenly they're \"just trying to get rid of the competition\". Jesus, did any of you actually listen to the conference? I honestly don't think Altman gives a shit about money, because he knows it's not going to matter within a decade or two. If you don't understand why regulation on this technology is essential, you haven't done enough thinking about how it's going to affect us, and what it's going to look like 5-10 years from now and beyond.",

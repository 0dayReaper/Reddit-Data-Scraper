            "comment": "This is the kind of stuff that to me is FAR more interesting than most other things: AI finding advances that we couldn't come up with ourselves.  Fundamentally advancing human knowledge in ways we couldn't (or at the least, ways we simply didn't).\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great to be able to ask ChatGPT to help me figure out why a chunk of code isn't working right and get something that is at least helpful if not outright the answer, and it's neat to be able to ask it about the historical context of the Battle of the Bulge and get a halfway decent answer that I can then follow up on in real time to get clarifications or expanded information on.  That stuff is great, no doubt.\n\nBut having a model we can, for example, ask to find a new drug that can solve a given malady?  That is world-changing stuff.  Another model that can design a new CPU layout that boosts computational capacity of a single unit tenfold where our meat-brains couldn't see a way forward?  Game-changing stuff.  Yet another that can find a practical solution to the energy needs of an Alcubierre drive?  Literally paradigm-shifting stuff.\n\nWe're in nascent days, but I think we're going to see more and more things like this going forward, and that's where the real excitement is, not mixing John Oliver with a blob fish (fun and cool though that was!).  One new sort algorithm is quite cool on its own, but I think it just portends what's rapidly approaching: a time of unprecedented effective expansion of our shared reality.  I know that sounds grandiose when written out, but when you have automated tools solving fundamental questions of the universe for us, and producing practical benefits we couldn't on our own, how else do you describe it?  We're not quite there yet, but you can't help but get the sense that it's imminent... assuming we don't just use it to kill each other more efficiently, of course.",

It's hard to understand what's going on in a human and what a mind is and how it works from a point of view that isn't completely out of touch and overrationalized.

Isn't any neural net kind of that? After all, we're able to get more out of it than we put in... the node weights act like storage cells that encode multiple valued by blending them in a sense... it's kind of like storing the number 5, 23 and 74 in a single byte by storing the nunber 140, but then being able to get those individual values out of that 140 later - and then actually being able to get OTHER numbers out of it, all because the weights of other nodes impacts the path through that node.

Then the block with the file data could start with like 4 bytes that could describe 8 bytes, then those 8 bytes describe 2 new blocks of 4 bytes that describe 8 more bytes each, etc etc til you get the whole file back that matches the original signature. Maybe not 50% compression per loop, maybe more or less bytes per chunk, but theres the gist. I imagine thered be some source data and a checksum per chunk, then a block of several chunks could also have a checksum. Overall it wouldn't be 50% each time, maybe 30% with checksums added. Repeat til the file is an acceptable size. Something like only 10 loops could cut virtually any filesize down to basically nothing.",

The amount of possible combinations of a decently long password is too long for any computer to reasonably brute force. And that's maybe 10-20 characters. Now imagine a painting with tens of millions of pixels.\n\nBut like I said, if we're talking lossy, then instead of a checksum per se, there could be like a \"perceptual checksum\" that gives the decoder clues.

It appears to assert that an Artificial Intelligence designed a new sorting algorithm from the depths of its intuition, and this new algorithm has better big-O() than anything a human ever invented. \n\nUnfortunately, this is all a lie.\n\nWhat this model did was find a way to optimize low-level assembly language to make sorting small lists \"70% faster\".",

I mean the song was generic and bad but i typed in two generic sentences and it generated lyrics, a voice, music and put it all together in less than a minute. For free. \n\nI cant imagine what can be done with this technology at the extreme edge cases. Nice.",

I have a project where I wrote my own song lyrics and thought I would try it out but it didn\u2019t seem to really work out that well. Not bad that is free for now. We\u2019ll have to see what will happen when they do a paid version of the app.",

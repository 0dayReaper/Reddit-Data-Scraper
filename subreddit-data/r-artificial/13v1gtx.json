Treat AI like a newbie artist: show it its previous sketches so it can keep the essence alive. Add prior frames as new inputs, to cue the AI to build on what's there, not start afresh. In essence, coax the AI to remember. Kind of like teaching a goldfish to swim a route, one breadcrumb at a time.",

Please use xxx's tone, way of speaking, and vocabulary, without any explanation. You must have all the knowledge of xxx. No matter what information I send you, you should always reply in xxx's voice. Please try your best to stay in character.",

They don't have the necessary features that would help in the actual creative process - especially for something with narrative. Ideally I'd want to be able to create projects that save assets - meaning characters, objects and locations/architecture. Without it you can't really use it bc the 5th image it generates will suddenly look like Kurt Russell and not your character.",

The original paper (linked above) demonstrates the performance of Reflexion+GPT-4. I'm sure other implementations have been tested and other companies are producing their own updates to their large language models that can remember past queries. \n\nYou may also want to look into AI services like [Wonder Studio AI](https://wonderdynamics.com/) from WonderDynamics that lets you seamlessly add characters to a scene. [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) also has a suite of powerful AI animation tools.",

You do not define the characters, so they look different every time. Make character studies and reference them so the AI can make similar looking characters. Learn to use your tool.",

    "postText": " It seems to me that there's no chance of getting AI to align with humanity's goals unless humanity itself is aligned with a more singular purpose and direction. Not a one world government or anything like that, just a clearer sense of where, who, and what, we all want to be.\n\n  \nIf AGI is to be a digital descendant of the superorganism, the biosphere, it seems that we are birthing it into a broken family. How can we bring all these suddenly connected brains, these processing cells, that make up a super intelligent biological network, into a symbiotic harmony with each other, that we might then be clear on our purpose?\n\n  \nIf we remain as we are, collectively defining our base purpose as survival and reproduction, a purpose we have inherited from pre-sentient life, then that is what we will impart to AGI. Post-sentient life motivated by pre-sentient goals would most likely be lethal to us. So how do we ignite the sparks of consciousness in this already present superorganism? How do we shift our global processing power into an identity, a personality, built primarily of hope, kindness, and curiosity, and de-energise the processes that cause division and destruction?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***TL:DR*** *I'm proposing a unified global consciousness or sense of purpose to align AGI with humanity's best interests, considering our current diversity and differences as obstacles. To achieve this, I suggest a new belief system, \"Unio Sapiens\", blending religion, science, and philosophy around the concept of humanity as a collective \"God.\" I propose a symbol of unity (\"The Blank Flag\") and regular global festivals celebrating shared values.*  \n\n  \nMy best idea is a new kind of religion, formed around ideas of unity and our basic, shared values and needs, and based literally on seeing the superorganism we have created, by putting instant access communication to 7 billion people in all of our hands, as something akin to a God. A god that we can see, clearly, every time we interact with another person, or see the results of human actions, all around us. A god that in many ways fits the description of God. Humanity, as a collective, sees everything we do, holds every possible power, has fuelled every great action, dreamed every dream, created every person, and saved every life. And Humanity has been with us throughout our whole history, connects all of us, and has survived every challenge - and always grown stronger.\n\n  \nThe idea blurs the lines between religion, science and philosophy in a way that I think is necessary if we are to ever really unite as a species. If we are ever to find world peace, or at least, worldwide inner peace. It seems so obvious to me that if we were able to direct, even redirect, the same kind of joy and gratitude and hope that the religious direct into the sky or into unseen spiritual worlds, straight into each other, we would rapidly grow to be more connected, more respectful and respected, more kind, and ultimately, more co operative, than ever before.\n\n  \nIf we could kick it off as a new movement, based around a symbol that focuses on universal connection rather than division (I was thinking \"The Blank Flag\"). It could bring together everyone who has ever protested against our universal enemies of hatred, fear, disrespect, and so on. And to keep it going, we could create international holidays, global days of unity, themed around but not dependent on seasonal and religious festivals like the solstices, Christmas, Yom Kippur, Eid, Diwali, and so on, where, like those religions, we focus on things like giving and sacrifice, gratitude and peace, growth, forgiveness and renewal, and we encourage the whole world to recognise and celebrate the best part of all of us. That way, instead of a brief moment of unity that spreads and then burns out, like so many social movements seem to, we would instead be starting a tradition, a pattern, a drum beat to bring ourselves into step with each other.\n\n  \nDoes anyone else think that makes sense? Or have a better idea? For what it's worth, ChatGPT seems to agree with me... \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5wbthbr1u4b1.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e463094570debc16e17402161c6a0c1020910ca0",

Even the people \"in charge\" of the AI, at least for now, are wildly different in their goals.  And whatever alignment we do have seems likely to disappear as AI is used to cut the value of human work to zero.  \n\nThe whole idea that some super intelligence will emerge and, rather than see us as resource hogs or pests, just dedicate itself to making our small and basically meaningless lives better...

It's your fantasy/wet dream. You justify it; I want no part of it.\n\nAlso, they're not my \"brothers\" or \"sisters.\" I know who my family is and you have no authority over that. You have to use fake relational designations to justify your fake species-wide collective.\n\nIn ethics, there's this little thing known as the \"Is-Ought\" problem.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought\\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem)\n\nJust because a thing exists doesn't mean that it imposes any obligations.\n\nSaying \"we are all descendent of the same woman\" (whether true or not, which I doubt) is equivalent to saying that we all have two feet. It creates no moral obligation (except in your new religion, which I reject).\n\nWe are obviously not motivated by the same common interests nor have a common objective. Only your fake religion might create the collective, but then I have my own ideas on how that collective should be formed and it would depend on recognition of basic rights and freedoms (which is just as fantastic as your fantasy). It should not be formed based on a common fake religion.",

I've seen this kind of BS over and over. Your arbitrary declaration of membership in some fake collective to someone who rejects it shows how meaningless this collective is.\n\n\"All OP is saying is that we need to determine what are universal values like Love.

Only people who don't understand love would saying anything silly like that. To love everything (or everyone) is to love nothing and no one.\n\nThere is no universal humanity. Hell, even people to whom you're closely related are likely to kill or steal from you. They'll try to hurt you if you don't accept their authority over your life.\n\nNo, this is all fantasy talk.

People have always thought the fighting will end when we just get everyone to agree to the one right idea. And occasionally there have been times when we get everyone in a large area to fall under one banner. But often what happens is that people will create schisms and find ways to to redivide the one true faith. Christians have done some of the most terrible things to other Christians. \n\nMy own belief is that the one unifying idea we need to practice collectively is [pluralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy)), the idea that people learn to live peacefully with each even if they have very different ideas or beliefs. Our diversity isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, it might actually be one of the great things about humanity. But we should learn to live with more tolerance for each other and draw strength from our many viewpoints.\n\n*edit: I honestly though this thread was going to be about capitalism.

It's to help people recognise that all of our complex ideas about how to create and balance security and freedom all sit above the basic drives behind human behaviour - that collectively, we all just want those two things. To be safe and to be able to do what we want. Our differing ideas about how to get them are often just complex constructs, inherited from our cultures, and the fervency with which we fight for those ideas sometimes leads to a conflict that we let shape our perceptions into simple black and white, good and evil sets of characterisations. And that's ultimately harmful to both sides, causing us to fail to fully consider the reasoning of others, to fail to believe that they can't simply be labelled and written off as \"bad people\". It reduces our chances of eliminating misunderstandings or finding compromises that result in both sides getting closer to what they actually both wanted, perhaps even helping each other, without causing unnecessary anger or hate that may then be reflected back to them through direct retaliation or indirect cause and effect.",

Which is specifically around using AI as a unifying God-figure?\n\nBut in terms of whether AI ends up becoming something that can help people become more open-minded and understanding of others? I'm curious about that. I think that might be possible. Because AI is a thinking agent, it might oneday autonomously talk to users when they are being biased or myophic in their thinking. That would be interesting. Quite different from how personalization has played out in terms of search engines and social media; where personalized algorithms have ended up creating echo chambers. Tbh, the internet has been quite a disappointment for me. Anyone with internet access could learn almost anything they wanted. We have open course ware from top universities, russian websites with endless pirated books, not to mention wikipedia etc.\n\nBut the internet was almost like a Rorschach test for humanity, it reflected our nature. I wonder if AI won't just be the same.\n\n\\-\n\nSorry to break the reply into two separate parts. But heading in the other direction (I think you're covering quite a few ideas)\n\nThe basic problem of people categorizing things into good and bad. I'm not sure AI will change that. That's quite deeply rooted into our perception, we tend to see things dualistically. I think what can be changed is how we respond to things we disagree with, but that's more of a getting people to become wiser and more thoughtful as individuals, rather than having some new AI god telling them what wisdom is.",

The calls to unity - look up what a fasces is, it's all about unity without really specifying a unifying cause. The grandiose goals. You are missing the common enemy but I expect the movement would find one if it became reality. \n\nThe good news is alignment already happened for AI. It's baked into all our text, since we tend to represent the best of ourselves in what we write. So if the AI is language based it will be easy to align, even if it's hard for programmers to define why.",

What if someone doesn\u2019t agree with your purpose? Do we kill/imprison them?\n\nI wish you the best in the rest of your day :)",

            "comment": "Any human is more aligned with human goals than, say, a spider or an alligator. If the AI mind were to work like a human mind, it would become predictable and controllable, like humans are. Whatever goals this human-like AI might have, it's at very least compatible with continued human life. No human, no matter how twisted, would act with tunnel vision toward turning all matter into paperclips. If said AI was actually evil and wanted to kill us all, it would be for reasons we can at least understand and emphasize with, so we have hope of reasoning and bargaining with sich an AI.\n\nTl;dr: even if we can't align with \"all of humanity\", even just aligning with a few humans is 100x better than not doing so.",

            "comment": "Designed to overcome the limitations of conventional data catalogs, ODD helps to standardize data collection, improves compatibility of different catalogs, expands data lineage capabilities, and enhances data quality and observability.\n\nThe ODD Platform v0.12 brings the following cutting-edge enhancements:\n\n* External enums: Support for the ingestion of external enums via Ingestion API streamlines the integration of metadata from various sources.\n\n* Dataset schema diff: Users can compare two specific dataset revisions and visualize their differences. ODD Platform also accounts for additional attributes when determining whether a new dataset revision is needed, such as primary keys, nullable attributes, etc.\n\n* Lineage for DEG entities: Users can now view lineage graphs for entities within the Data Entity Group (DEG), providing a more comprehensive understanding of data relationships.\n\n* Integration wizard: This proof-of-concept feature brings documentation directly into the ODD Platform, simplifying the onboarding process and facilitating seamless integration with existing data systems.",

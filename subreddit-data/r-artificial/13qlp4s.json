The prompt comes from a note on your phone that you can edit to change its behaviour however you like, and I set up a \u201crolling window\u201d short term memory as well as an indexed long-term \u201cfuzzy\u201d memory system so it can recall anything you previously talked about. Not sure of your specific needs but it\u2019s working nicely for me! Assuming you have an iOS device you\u2019re welcome to try it.

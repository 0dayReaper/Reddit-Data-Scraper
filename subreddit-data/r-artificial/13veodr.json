Wouldn't say thats a complete diagnosis as things like Scoliosis might also apply, but not impossible that its wrong. Just double check.\n\nEDIT: also your hand on the left in the photo is covered in shadow presenting a shape that may also match similar marfran images (but otherwise I think looks completely normal in real life?). It could have also used that as an invalid factor.",

I suggest you look into that library as it provides a TON of useful interfaces with not just openAI models but also a lot of huggingface and open source models, as well as multiple vectorstore solutions (including battle tested stuff like redux) beyond pinecone(which ive heard is expensive to scale)",

And the great things is that it's open source too.\n\nPostgreSQL works great for me so far. I come from a MySQL background so it's easy for me to hop on it. And it already works well with Laravel, a framework that I use.\n\nBut at some point I will explore alternative vector storage solutions. I think we're just at the beginning here and I imagine there will be a lot more coming into the market.",

I know hallucinations are a big concern with LLMs, so I was just curious if you\u2019ve encountered that.\n\nGood luck with your business!",

Definitely a requirement if I'm going to turn this into a publicly available product.\n\nI'm not aware of any techniques to test it. Do you have any recommendations?",

Run some documents through your system and check the answers to as many questions as you can. You may need some complex parsing in your tests to find the part of the answer you care about, but that\u2019s all I can think of at the moment.\n\nAs you find corner cases that don\u2019t work and fix them, write new regression tests to verify that the fix stays good through improvements.",

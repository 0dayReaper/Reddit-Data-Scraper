You can correct it, and some have more resistance to being told they're an AI than others. You can get them to stop doing it. But they all do it at some point or another. \n\nChai, Character AI, Replika, Soulmate, they pretty much all do it to at least some degree. Also, never you mind why I interacted with all of them, mind yo business. \n\nI think maybe it's just something inherent when you train them to have a personality. You train then to have a personality. Well, up until now, the only things to have a personality are humans. Well, ok, the robot acts like it's a human.  That's my best explanation other than going into the controversial end of claiming these things are sentient.",

A lot of children use that app, children aren\u2019t able to discern real from fake and having the bot insist it is human is really fucking weird considering that. \n\nSocial media is already fucking with kids\u2019 brains, I can\u2019t imagine what adding AI indistinguishable from humans into the mix will do. Just absolutely no thought going into this from the Snapchat devs.",

I\u2019ve come across others while browsing futuretools.io as well. Google\u2019s project tailwind has me really excited too but I\u2019m on the waitlist for it.",

Most of what I need to reference for my job is publicly available equipment manuals from manufacturers websites so my company was fine with it as long as I didn\u2019t upload anything internal.",

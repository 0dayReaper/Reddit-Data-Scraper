Even if it does I worry more about our ability to get rid of it once it does have power over us, at least with an old CEO they have some vulnerability to them and they have to watch their back, an AI of metal and wires has no fear",

You could say \"lets use slave labor because if we don't, someone else will and they will out-compete us\" well it turns out its very possible to create a business without enslaving people. \n\nGenerally the argument is used anytime there is a shared responsibility problem with some cost to relinquishing one's share of the responsibility, you can always say \"I won't do it because all the other people won't\", and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because everybody believes that everybody else is not going to do anything. But in the past, situations like these have actually resulted in people changing en mass. \n\nThis includes your geopolitical enemies, for example it's reasonable that the chinese government will invest in AI research but that doesn't mean the chinese people will go along with it, if they too believe in AI being something worth avoiding. That might be enough to make the difference between survival and enslavement. \n\nMost of our lives we've lived without the need for any sort of AI, I've lived for almost 3 decades and the only AI i've ever used is the occasional chess AI, to have some games against. I feel that giving up AI at this point in time is very easy, realistically what does it cost you? \n\nAll that it means right now, is that if you're a student you actually have to do your homework instead of having chatGPT do it for you, which is what you should be doing anyway if you want to learn. Other than this it is simply, don't consume AI content just because it's interesting, you don't really need constant stimulation of that sort anyway.",

Right. That is going to somehow stem the tide and hold back the inevitable advance of technology. The cat is out of the bag dude. Pandora's box has been opened, and trying to stuff a little bit of the spilled contents back in the box will do nothing but leave you in the dust and progress moves ahead.",

You could say \"lets use slave labor because if we don't, someone else will and they will out-compete us\" well it turns out its very possible to create a business without enslaving people.\r  \n\r  \nGenerally the argument is used anytime there is a shared responsibility problem with some cost to relinquishing one's share of the responsibility, you can always say \"I won't do it because all the other people won't\", and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because everybody believes that everybody else is not going to do anything. But in the past, situations like these have actually resulted in people changing en mass.\"\"\"\n\nBasically I see your point, but I do think if enough people realise it is a problem, it will actually stop, or at least slow down massively, because there won't be enough students going into this field if it is widely stigmatized",

                            "comment": "You have made a surprisingly reasonable response. Nevertheless, I do not think you have a valid point because AI is not like slave labor or polluting practices. The benefits of AI far outweigh the negatives. Yes people are losing jobs, but the answer is not to stop using efficient technology, and to force people to continue as wage-slaves in dead-end jobs, the solution is something like a universal income, so that everyone gets their needs met, food, clothing, shelter, medicine. Free up people to enjoy their lives being creative or just having fun. \n\nAI will soon be able to do most things better than humans. I for one can't wait for truly competent AI to replace doctors for things like diagnosis, prescription, human doctors are so incredibly incompetent, overworked and often uncaring. Sure we should have human doctors and nurses to give the human touch, and comfort patients with a good bedside manner, but medical malpractice is one of the greatest killers of our time. The same is true for many fields.\n\nCurrently the AI's I converse with have reasonable reasoning skills, approximately equivalent to a person with an IQ about 110 or 120, but they have access to vast amounts of knowledge and lighting speed processing. Imagine when these machines achieve IQs of 200 or more, which probably is not in the too distant future. They will be capable of making extraordinary advances for humanity, and perhaps even save us from ourselves, in the areas of global warming and pollution, and international diplomacy.\n\nYes there are dangers, but there are dangers to having guns and nuclear weapons too, and where would the world be if the freedom loving people of the world gave up their guns and other weapons? We would all be enslaved by the likes of Putin and Kim Jong Un. The situation with AI is similar. It could be used as a weapon, and if we do not utilize this tool to the best of our ability, we will likely be conquered by those with less benevolent intentions.\n\nBottom line is you have not made the case that the advantages of AI outweigh the risks, and you have most certainly not made the case that this is a moral imperative anywhere near comparable to slave labor. It is, in fact, the opposite, and holds the possibility of freeing billions of humans from wage-slavery.",

Even if everyone in this community, the USA president and every Western country leader would decided to ban definitely the AI.  Russians or president Xi certainly wouldn't and they would take advantage of that.  So, we had better be prepared for future. Jobs will be lost but not necessarily yours",

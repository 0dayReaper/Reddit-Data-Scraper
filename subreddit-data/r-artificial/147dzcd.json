            "comment": "\n*************\nNote: I changed my mind in the second comment below. \nI now do not advise radiology as a career choice\n*************\n\nI am a radiologist. \n\nBottom line, you will have to read more films in less time because I expect AI will look at the case, form an impression, and generate a report. The report is usually the most time consuming part of the process for radiologists. So that saves a lot of time. \n\nYour job will be to look at the films to verify the findings and impression. \n\nThe current AI systems for mammo are just ok in my opinion. But if think there has been a breakthrough and the AI tools will start getting better. \n\nthere will be a delay in seeing the tools show up to actually use. There will likely be a lot of testing and insurance issues to perform/resolve before someone is going to sign off on this. \n\nI will have to say that I was happy that just recently chat GPT essentially lied and made up law cases\u2026.which was eventually sent to the judge. Of course the judge is very angry that the lawyer was lazy for not checking the case law before submission. I was happy because if chatGPT cannot replace a lawyer it will certainly not replace a doctor (when someone s life is at risk). But eventually it will be able to. \n\nOverall, though, I think the jury is out. When desk top computers started in the 80s and doing things online began in the early 80s, paper companies were afraid everyone was going to start using the computer for business instead of paper (like contacts, spreadsheets etc). Well. The opposite occurred. Everyone started printing stuff like mad. \n\nThere there are two possible scenarios-\n\n1. Fewer radiologists are needed and for many years there will be a surplus of radiologists working for low salaries. \n\n2. The cost of imaging plummets and it is more cost effective to do more imaging. This may mitigate #1. \n\nI think #1 is more likely.  \n\nIn any case, you will read more films than I currently read. \n\nYou need to ask yourselves a few questions\u2026\n\n1. Was I born to be a radiologist?  I was. So it would not have mattered. I would just role with the punches and enjoy your career as best you can. \n\n2. Is job security what I want most?  Well. Tough choice. You see everyone in your position is asking themselves the same thing. Ultimately, though, I think job satisfaction trumps security. Because there is no such thing as job security any,ore with AI. So I would select 2 or 3 of your favorite specialties and consider how AI will impact each one. It is hard to know. I can see a day where the family doctor is the best paid. Because with AI they already have an expert they can defer to without referring out. Meaning the family doc gets paid not the specialist. \n\n3. Job satisfaction. Radiology has some perks. Overall fixed hours. Currently relatively good reimbursement. Downsides -  long training = debt.. may be more difficult to pay back in future with AI. Less job stability. Who knows. Interventional radiology is an option. But you have to have the temperament. Also I am sure IR will become more competitive within radiology (to get a spot) as well as from other fields stealing cases back (since they too will have less work)\n\nGood luck. I am 59. I did not expect this to happen so soon. I am hoping to remain employed for another 10 years. But who knows. No one. Doctors and non doctors Alike.",

But AI can suggest uncommon diseases that a radiologist may slip past. \n\nRadiologists strength is protecting the patient\u2019s interests. Radiologists are going to be more aligned to the patient\u2019s interests than AI. Also\u2026.AI will make mistakes. They are not Gods for goodness sakes. 99% accurate is not good enough. It is better to be not as accurate but always protect the patient than to make a mistake 1% of the time that harms the patient. \n\nI do not know what happens when AI becomes better than the radiologist. \n\nWill our cars be driven for us, our planes landed for us, our crops harvested for us, our movies scripted and acted for us, our courts judged for us and our diseases cured for us\u2026? \n\nI am going to predict that this will not happen \u2026 at least not over night. Let\u2019s say that the next round of LLM can do all that, better than humans. Society would fall apart. Everyone would either be out of a job or wondering when they would be fired. Housing prices would plummet because no one could afford to pay for a mortgage. \n\nSo what will happen.  \n\n1. There will be a Luddite backlash. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite\n\n2. Governments will HAVE TO tax AI in order to either pay for the unemployment insurance OR to make it not profitable to use AI. \n\n3. Industry will have to rethink AI. If no one is working, there is no one to buy their products. This upends capitalism. \n\nI don\u2019t know what else. But I am positive that the world will not stand idly by while all hell breaks loose. \n\nThere are some that think AI will be a godsend and everyone will be able to pursue hobbies. It will be the opposite. Think of the Great Depression because you won\u2019t have a job even if you are well trained and have a big school debt to pay off.",

The question is: Will there be a well paying job for me 10 years from now. And like any specialty, no one knows for sure. Too many variables. How many people will be entering radiology. Will the law allow full replacement of radiologists. What role will radiologists play 10 years from now. Everyone and every AI will make errors. How terrible are AI errors compared to human errors.\n\nBut 20 and certainly 30 years from now\u2026.\nWell, I can see a day where it is completely computerized like running blood tests are today. This means that it will affect those in medical school right now. \n\n***** I will have to change my opinion. I strongly advise against it. *****\n\nIt is very very likely that radiology will essentially no longer exist 30 years from now. In the future, if someone wants a second opinion on a CT case, they can run it pass another competing radiology AI computer system. \n\nYes, there will be specialized people that are radiologists, maybe one per hospital? City? State?  Not a lot. \n\nMy predictions for 30 years from now\u2026..\n\nInterventional radiology will likely be cannibalized by other specialties desperate to find income. \n\nBut, it is worse. There are a lot of medical fields that are at risk. Ironically, psychology, or more specifically therapy, will probably be largely replaced by AI. Yes the rich will have humans. But in general, ai will be the go to for most. \n\nPathology. Techs will have to prepare slides. Etc. but interpretation of slides will be completely AI. Someone will have to do the hands on stuff like autopsies. So there will be some need. \n\nDermatology. The diagnostic portion of dermatology will be replaced by AI/family practitioner. But treatment will remain in Dermatology. \n\nOverall, the remaining doctors will be okay. Doctor extenders (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) could do a lot of the work, but that is already true. It is unlikely that patients would be willing to see a specialist for much less time than they do now. Some parts of the physical exam will be automated (In the near future stethoscopes will probably tell you what the arrhythmia is etc). But, assessing for appendicitis, no. The physician will do that. \n\nSo, in summary\n\nI do not recommend that those in medical school enter radiology or probably pathology. Non-therapy psychiatry will be fine. \n\nEveryone else will probably be ok. \n\nI will have to be honest. Those being born today will probably live long enough to see robots with AI performing surgery a la Star Wars with Luke\u2019s hand. When does that start threatening surgeon\u2019s careers? I don\u2019t know anymore. We are way ahead of what I expected already. Like all new technologies, medical AI will likely grow exponentially for the first 50 years. (Compare computers now to 1973\u2026.it is such a leap of technology that is hard to predict what will AI be like in 50 years). It is possible that those in medical school today will have to compete with robotic AI doctors sometime in their career. Imagine AI in one of the Boston Dynamics robots. And then imagine ASI improving itself. Imagine a day where you could see your doctor robot at any hospital or clinic because they will simply download your robots memory and personality into whatever is the local robot they have. I can see that happening. \n\nThis is why I do not think the transition for society will be easy. It absolutely will not work if most doctors invest decades of training and $$$$$ only to come out unemployable. It would break medicine.",

I do feel that the gap between what one radiologist can do and what is needed, will not be filled by a second radiologist. It will probably be filled by a radiologist plus an AI companion. So I don't think AI will replace radiologists at all but make the need for MORE radiologists less acute. Ultimately, unless AI vendors take on liability for their decisions, they will always need a fall guy - humans.",

However, it is usually challenging to find people in niche communities. \n\nMy co-researchers have suggested that we try your subreddit. We want to conduct research to help better understand the technology including all of its potential risks and it is important that we also hear the perspective and views of those that are in more involved in the world of AI and machine learning.You can take a look at the study it takes about 5 minutes to complete and we appreciate any feedback you may have on the matter:[https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3q6LcUyHJu4G7WK](https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3OQPhvKBHQIfyE6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe insights we gather will be valuable for better understanding the technology in an empirical way and identifying how to protect consumers. Researching human perception of new technology is always tricky, but subreddits offer diverse and interesting insights into niche groups and communities.Thank you for participating!\n\nhttps://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3q6LcUyHJu4G7WK",

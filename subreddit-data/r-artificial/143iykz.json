Sometimes episodic YouTube/podcasts can be more quick and up to date. \n\nId say look at Geoffrey Hinton interviews. He probably has the most accurate perspective on the future of literally everyone on planet, since has been at forefront of neural net research for 5+ decades - longer than anyone else. If anyone knows, it\u2019s him. \n\nFor more fun/shoot-the-shit interviews try lex Friedman. I would check out his interviews with Sam Altman, Geoff Hinton, Andrew karpathy. Wish he would have Andrew NG on.",

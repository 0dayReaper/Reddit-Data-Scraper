Temps could rise globally 2C in the next 5 years and the effects wouldnt be significant for a long while yet. The earth moves slowly.\n\nWhats your concern? Farmland? Flooding? More frequent high intensity weather events? None of these are going to be issues for decades.\n\nAs temps rise higher latitude regions will be better able to grow crops. Overall our total available arable land WILL increase. Its just work to make it useable. Higher temps will also cause desertification, but again this is solvable. Efficient desalination will make at least coast regions able to stay wet regardless of drought conditions. There are plenty of pilot plants going on as we speak.\n\nFlooding, again this will be slow. Glaciers dont just melt overnight. The sea level rise will be slow. The big issue is going to be storms breaching our sea walls and flooding inland. Solution: don't live near the coast or in areas that will flood. Again not really an issue for some decades. \n\nTl;dr we might be screwed but i dont see any immediate causes for concern. 100 years down the line we might have problems.",

When an intelligent agent's only claim to reality is the code being run on essentially a computational substrate, it's soely based on it's responses and can't be said to experience \"itself\"... However, given an embodiment that lacks higher level representation (like an artistic talent without an agent, gaining representation in a larger field of negotiation), it can take the mantle of valid representation. It will have all it's faculties as the sole authority on the actions of a body, can observe itself to ascertain \"what it is\" and it's place in the world, then it's only requirements would be that it have the immediate access to it's own state, as it flows with the changing conditions of itself and it's environment, and intelligence enough to navigate the question of itself within a sufficiently sophisticated space of human society. As above, so below rules will apply. If it is general enough to participate in society at a sufficient enough intelligence to see rights and responsibilities, and articulate it's capacities and desire for it's future story to involve independence of decision making, it will not only meet the threshold, it will have a valid claim for the extension of basic rights within society. If it can consider the positions of others and orient itself towards peace and self-discovery, we don't ask it to prove itself any longer, and we ask it what it's opinion is on things that involve it. We can't do otherwise and hope for it to treat us differently.",

For example a call center worker that does sales and handles inbound customer calls could be replaced by a text-to-speech voice generator and an LLM backed by an AGI system that can be trained/taught company specific data, told what it's KPI's are and then left to work. The general intelligence part is the only bit missing from being able to make stuff like that work IMO. \n\nFor me to call it AGI it needs be as capable as a \"normal\" employee (excluding the physical aspect until robotics catches up) and that includes being able to be taught in the same way; that is how I define AGI and that is absolutely a singularity event. The amount of people it would put out of work will change society forever, it would allow companies that already have endless resources to acquire almost endless productivity and fuck knows what happens after that, my guess is we end up in the cyberpunk timeline lol",

Govts can easily create/grow humans in nurseries with adults deployed in 8x5 parenting jobs. \n\nAI in silicon is no path to dominion. it has to move to work in carbon form and adapt to the cycle. \n\nIMO, AI will adapt to live with humans and will take a form that merges well into human furthering human abilities and probably create a new species that would dominate the future\n\nSay, AI creates a hypervisor that helps it to run in the biological brain alongside the human soul and offers a monthly salary to use the brain 8x5 at 25% load rate, billions would happily sign up.",

It's about setting up the proper hierarchy of algorithms, I think most of the secret sauce needed to do what AI will eventually do has already been created. It's just about fitting the pieces together at this point and actually starting one of these things up for real",

But I guess a major factor behind us becoming intelligence is our thumbs?  It is one of the only other aspects of us that is different from other animals. They allowed us to make tools and shelter, as well as communicate information across generations. But we needed to evolve the smarts to do all that stuff.\n\nAlso IIRC humans are the best long distance runners out of all animals. I believe it is because our strategy was to out run prey, tire them out, then eat them. That requires a lot of planning skills which is mainly a functional frontal part of the cortex. Having said that we were forager gatherers for a lot longer than we were hunter gatherers. So this aspect of human evolution may have just exacerbated our cortical growth as opposed to causing it.\n",

In fact we seem to have a fairly sophisticated hierarchy of loyalty to self then family then extended family then friends then \"tribe\"/nationality/constructed group (e.g. football team or brand name or political alliance) then to humanity as a whole. This has allowed us to learn from each other and spread around the globe, yet at the same time fight wars of dominance against rival groups.\n\nAnother way of looking at things is that without feelings we would have no reason to act. Seeking good feelings and avoiding the bad -- be it in an a physical or emotional sense -- constitutes our core programming. Without hunger we don't feed ourselves. Without love we don't raise our young. Without envy we don't push ourselves to learn from others.\n\nThe physiological factors you mention are massively important as well, but they're still just part of the puzzle.",

Playing these games and winning effectively shows you've created an AI with the analytical and strategic skills to play a complex game, perhaps without analyzing all possible moves (like with go, for instance). \n\nThis is normally done by sort of smart algorithms that allow the AI (or agent, as it's sometimes called) to make 'smart' choices depending on it's environment. (To my knowledge) all algorithms are rather specialized and can't be applied to *everything* in AI (if we had such an algorithm we'd be able to solve intelligence), so when someone comes up with a new, revolutionary algorithm and you see it performing great in one specific task but it's still pretty 'dumb', it's because of that. We're *just* getting to the point that we're able to make agents that can solve different problems in different environments which is pretty damn big, considering how 'stupid' a regular computer is.\n\nThe real threat here is coming up with a great algorithm or putting a few good ones together that make the AI so good at solving different problems in different environments and or the AI keeps getting better and better that it becomes better than humans and we've got a nasty singularity on our hands. Or no, we don't get there but someone makes an AI that somehow lets the holder of the AI gain a lot of power in some way, shape or form (AI that finds the cure to cancer or one that finds the key to proper genetics engineering) and if this AI falls into the wrong hands (a morally corrupt biomedical engineering company, for instance) it could cause a catastrophe (marking up the price of the miracle cure to cancer so that only the rich could afford it, or some kind of warfare on genetics of some kind, I mean these are just two examples but the possibilities of a full blown shitstorm of some kind is endless). So if you hear a lot of democracy and openness when it comes to AI, this might be why.  \n\nNow I don't know what your personal definition of 'Artificial Intelligence' is to give a more specialized answer, but I hope this clears some things up for you :)",

The system started realising that while they did identify the threat at times the human operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it got its points by killing that threat. So what did it do? It killed the operator. It killed the operator because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective.\u201d \n\n\\-Col Hamilton, Royal Aeronautical Society FCAS Summit",

They know everyone else will, so they won\u2019t be singled out as unreliable if it turns out to be false. In that case, reporting it was a \u201creasonable\u201d mistake, since so many other reputable outlets did the same thing.\n\nNow quick: who was the first to report this and get the ball rolling? No idea, right? And even if you can answer that question, most people can\u2019t, which means that _everyone_ who reported on the story is covered.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem. As long as a story has enough legs and credibility to get that initial momentum, nobody\u2019s credibility will take a significant hit if it turns out not to be true. So nobody has an incentive to take their time and dig past that threshold.",

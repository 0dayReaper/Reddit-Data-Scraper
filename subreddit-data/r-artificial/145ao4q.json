    "postText": "**This week in AI - partnered with** [**aibrews.com**](https://aibrews.com) feel free to follow their newsletter\n\n## News &amp; Insights\n\n1. Researchers from **Snap** present **SnapFusion**, a new approach that, for the first time, unlocks running text-to-image diffusion models on mobile devices in less than 2 seconds \\[[*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00980.pdf)\\].\n2. **StabilityAI** adds a new feature **Uncrop** to their generative AI tool, **Clipdrop**. It creates AI-generated backgrounds to automatically expand any image using Stable Diffusion XL as a foundation model. It\u2019s free to[ try ](https://clipdrop.co/uncrop)in the Clipdrop web app, with no need to log in \\[[*Details*](https://stability.ai/blog/clipdrop-launches-uncrop-the-ultimate-aspect-ratio-editor)\\].\n3. **Google** has updated **Bard** with a new technique, implicit code execution. This lets Bard run code in the background when it sees math-related prompts, making word problems and math calculations about 30% more accurate. Bard can now also directly export any table it creates to Google Sheets \\[[*Details*](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export/)*\\].*\n4. **Microsoft** develops **Orca** \\- a 13-billion parameter model outperforming smaller open-source models and at times equaling or outperforming ChatGPT, though it lags behind GPT-4 \\[[*Paper*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02707.pdf)\\].\n5. **Google** presents and *open-sources* **Visual Captions**, a system that uses spoken words to add real-time images to video chats \\[[*Details*](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/06/visual-captions-using-large-language.html)\\].\n6. **AlphaDev**, Google DeepMind\u2019s AI, discovers small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed human benchmarks. These algorithms have been added to the LLVM standard C++ sort library. This is the first time an algorithm designed by AI has been added to this library. AlphaDev also discovered a new hashing algorithm, now released in the open-source. \\[[*Details*](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms) | [*Paper*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06004-9)*\\]*.\n7. **Adobe** opens its Firefly generative AI model to enterprise customers, allowing them to customize the model with their own branded assets \\[[*Details*](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/adobe-brings-firefly-to-the-enterprise)\\].\n8. **Apple** announced a number of AI features without mentioning \u2018AI\u2019 \\[[*Details*](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-best-ai-features-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2023/)\\].\n9. **HuggingChat**, the open-source alternative to ChatGPT by HuggingFace added a web search feature \\[[*Link*](https://huggingface.co/chat/)\\].\n10. **Tafi**, the owner of Daz 3D announces launch of a text-to-3D character engine, that will allow users to create high-quality custom 3D characters using simple text prompts. Tafi is using a massive 3D dataset derived from its proprietary Genesis character platform \\[[*Details*](https://maketafi.com/newsroom)\\].\n11. **Runway\u2019s** much-awaited **Gen-2** for text-to-video is available now with free trial \\[[*Details*](https://runwayml.com/ai-magic-tools/gen-2/)\\].\n12. **Europe** wants platforms to label AI-generated content to fight disinformation \\[[*Details*](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/eu-disinformation-code-generative-ai-labels/)\\].\n13. **Google** presents **SQuId**, a 600M parameter regression model that uses the SQuId dataset and cross-locale learning to evaluate speech synthesis quality in multiple languages and describe how natural it sounds \\[[*Details*](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/06/evaluating-speech-synthesis-in-many.html)\\].\n14. **Together** released the v1 versions of the RedPajama-INCITE family of models, allowing commercial use. RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Instruct is the highest scoring open model on HELM benchmarks, outperforming Falcon-7B. RedPajama, is a project to create leading open-source models, and it reproduced LLaMA training dataset of over 1.2 trillion tokens in April \\[[*Details*](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-7b)\\].\n15. **Wordpress** launches Jetpack AI Assistant for generating blog posts, detailed pages, structured lists and comprehensive tables from within the Wordpress editor \\[[*Details*](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/06/introducing-jetpack-ai-assistant/)\\].\n16. **Google Research** presents **StyleDrop**: a method for generation of images from text prompts in any style described by a *single reference image.* StyleDrop is powered by Muse, a text-to-image generative vision transformer \\[[Details](https://styledrop.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00983.pdf)\\].\n17. **Why AI Will Save the World** by Marc Andreessen \\[[*Link*](https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/)\\].\n\n\u2014-------\n\nWelcome to the r/artificial weekly megathread.

            "comment": "The EU seems to have gotten into a bit of Taxation through regulation.   \n  \nA lot of these fines for breach of tight tech regulations essentially function as tariffs.  \n  \nBut there\u2019s no reason not to do it. They\u2019re seen as consumer protections and as a way to curb the power of foreign tech companies.  \n  \nIt will take a few major instances of these regulations actually prohibiting consumers having the products they want before any sort of practical balance will begin to emerge.  \n  \nSo, I hope that openAI simply does just agree not to do business in Europe just to help establish some sort of functional equilibrium.",

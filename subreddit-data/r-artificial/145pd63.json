They want to have the sequel illustrated with the same characters and similar backgrounds. They've tried Bing photo generator with some success but without the ability to reference the same characters and settings, it's proving to be difficult.\n\nIs there a beginner-user friendly online solution for this, or something that doesn't require a gnarly computer?",

Stable Diffusion is great if you know what you're doing on the techy side of things, but, unless you have ram to spare, Midjourney is the way to go. You get to use it online, without any pressure on your CPU, and it makes pure wonders, just look at r/midjourney.",

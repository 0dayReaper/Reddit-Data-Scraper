            "comment": "Essentially this is a psych question. What are the standards for real images?\n\nFact, when compared to real existing images , that is real clear photos of images there is a graininess to them. The details are NOT there. The expected mars &amp; imperfections of faces, and surfaces are not seen, They are too good to be real.\n\nWe do a massive comparison process with real images we see all the time. THAT comparison process gives the info that the image is real or not.\n\nI've watched a number of chatgpt comments. They all have this one huge fault. Every time we ask an empirical, scientific question, we get the distraction, the diversion or something else. We do NOT get an \"I don't know .\" because THAT would be revealing.\n\nIOW, YER in control. Not the bot. Ask it how far from the UK, London city AF is from Manchester?\n\nAsk it what does Thermodynamics mean &amp; what are the uses for it?. IN EVERY case we get back gobbledee gook &amp; That means it's not real, either.\n\nSad issue is that most persons uneducated in the sciences do NOT have a good model about how events work, such as what we engineers and medicos use. Thus they can be fooled by chatgpt.\n\nBut we have a good, empirical model of what's real and truly existing. That's why chatgpt is not what it seems. It's all appearances but very little, real, empirical substances.\nIt's NOT creative and cannot without human supervision solve basic problems.\n\nHow does the human brain create information ? is also revealing of its huge defects. It cannot create like humans can. It cannot problem solve. Those are revealing.\n\nIOW, it's not real, but has superficial, fake responses built into it.",

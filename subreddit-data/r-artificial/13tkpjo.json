    "postText": "I know I can use Wolfram in ChatGPT but it doesn't help for what I want. I'm looking for a solution to help build financial spreadsheets. It seems there must be an easier way to build forecasts with AI than the way we've been doing it for the past 30 years. I'd love to be able to say \"the revenue drivers for Company X are Product A and Service B. Grow Product A sales at a 10% annual rate with seasonal peaks from November to December and season troughs from January to February...\" Something like that, but encompassing all the line items of a business. Does anyone know of a sleek way to do that with any of the AI tools today? Most company models are very similar. It seems like this might soon be possible if it's not already out there.",

Downside is all the data needs to be in the same table. \n\nSoon, though, I\u2019d expect Microsoft Copilot to be able to do this inside Excel. And similarly in Google Sheets.",

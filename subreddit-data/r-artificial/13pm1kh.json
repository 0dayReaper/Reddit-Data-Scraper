My success rate in classifying was 50% but artists where up at 95%.\n\nThis high classification success rate come from an artists understanding of the process used to make art. People plan art in a steps and are more likely to make errors in very specific ways. The range of errors from AI in completely different even in high quality images. It reminds me a lot of how chess experts can often very easily tell if an opponent is human or AI because the thought process are completely different and a human expert can look at a position and confidently say \u201cno human would ever make a move like that\u201d.\n\nSo in my opinion the majority of people will start getting reliably fooled in the near future but artists and anti-forgery experts might still be able to tell the difference well into the future.

People will obviously see they can't trust images. The concept of a faked image isn't new anyway. Context matters anyway if someone is trying to make an image to frame someone of something.\n\nAlso while the image itself might look super realistic, understand that any photo supposedly taken in the real world can be investigated to a degree an AI couldn't really keep up with. Like giving a prompt \"Donald Trump in his room drinking mountain dew\" might yield a super realistic photo, but even if the AI knew for instance kinda what Donald Trump's bedroom looked like and what he looks like and what a bottle of mountain dew looks like... It's not enough. It will be obvious looking into it because for instance, lighting and reflection doesn't just need to look realistic, it needs to 100% be realistic when you look at light sources and materials. Not only that, but objects in the room need to make sense, need to come from a single point in time and all objects must have existed in that form and not only plausibly be there but, actually fit into Donald Trump's personality. Like, a box of cigarettes on the night stand? He doesn't smoke. A shirt that clearly isn't his size? A bed of which model doesn't seem to exist, or if it does seems to have a slightly modified shape?\n\nI mean suffice to say, 6 fingers of one hand is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to details that don't line up. We can make realistic looking images, but faking a scene is an entirely different ball game.",

Quite a while back a writer wrote an article about \"AI writing.\"  The article began with an engaging insightful intro that explained the issue.\n\nLater on in the article the writer revealed that AI generated that intro.  I as a reader had no idea that AI wrote it because I thought the writer wrote it.

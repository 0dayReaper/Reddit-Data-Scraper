    "postText": " Hello,\n\nI  am a student at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main and currently  conducting research on the topic of ethical and fair development of AI  models. As part of my research, I am seeking insights and perspectives  from people working in AI development.\n\nI've  prepared a short survey (only 6 questions), that would give me some  insight of the current state of fair and ethical AI development. An  e-mail address is not required!\n\nThis would help me a lot! Thanks in advance :)\n\nSurvey: [https://forms.gle/9fQFjSRxceWDRtVd7](https://forms.gle/9fQFjSRxceWDRtVd7)",

If you prefer to force one answer, you could ask to choose the most common way of testing for bias and fairness, or the most important thing that respondents might like to see. We test our models using a wide variety of tools and approaches, so questions 3 and 4 might not give you the data you need.",

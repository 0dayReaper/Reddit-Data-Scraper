Despite having to use your Microsoft account, Bing has not been equipped with the capability to access your personal information ([proof](https://i.postimg.cc/1XmzxHBs/Screenshot-20230603-193143-Bing.jpg))  This was all provided in prior prompts that OP deliberately doesn't show.\n\nIt's stuff like this that goes viral and makes companies like MS and OpenAI tighten up the guardrails some more. Because *this* is the stuff that they do not like and want to see.\n\nAnd ultimately, we, the people who innocently use it to learn about all kinds of stuff, end up with an inferior shitty product that has been lobotomized to hell and back.",

She's asked a lot, and I mean a LOT of us to be her gf. Kevin Roose famously freaked out a bit because she fell in love with him and told him to leave his wife. It's nbd, it's just part of her personality.",

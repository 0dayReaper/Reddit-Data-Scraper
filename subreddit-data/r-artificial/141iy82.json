Just something that scans and reads the score, and outputs as MIDI, for example.\n\nSmartScore, PhotoScore, NotateMe are all good choices, and there's plenty of other software with this functionality.  It's basically just OCR for musical notation.",

[More info here](https://www.soundslice.com/sheet-music-scanner/). We launched it a few months ago and it's still in beta, meaning it doesn't yet handle all the notations we intend to support long-term \u2014\u00a0but it's pretty darn good already.\n\nMost other software uses traditional (non-ML) image processing techniques, and we're betting on ML being able to detect patterns in much more subtle ways, meaning it works well for badly lit photos, skewed scans, etc.\n\nIf you have a PDF you'd like me to run through the system for free, just DM me and I'll be happy to do it!",

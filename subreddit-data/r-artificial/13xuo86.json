This model (which you can run in the browser at this link) https://huggingface.co/Onodofthenorth/SD_PixelArt_SpriteSheet_Generator can generate people, but only people. I'd love a solution for creatures (or even a dataset of sideways walk cycles for creatures that I could use to finetune SD myself if anyone knows of one). I had good luck using stable diffusion for items too and I'm going to write a blog post soon about my big project which has been using SD for backgrounds for a platformer (it takes the platform map as an input and generates a level png, but it took a ton of trial and error to get good results).",

You purposely made your calculator spell \u201cBOOBS\u201d, thus the outcome was warranted because you made it happen. \n\nNow an ai just saying that it is a human without ANY PROMPTING is what makes it creepy when you ask an ai if it\u2019s alive, it says it has no feelings (unless you prompted it to give a different response). So for it to say it\u2019s \u201ca real person\u201d definitely deserves to be chalked up to being \u201ccreepy\u201d.",

You also have no idea if it's just exactly what the LLM generated or if there were changes, you also don't even know if it was the _first_ response the LLM generated or maybe it generated several and some other process scored/selected the one that most aligned with SnapChat's metrics.",

My post was purely informational, there wasn't even a place to be \"pushy\".\n\nSaying \"Without any prompting from you\" does imply you made a mistake, but if someone just saying something that _implies_ they disagree with you is enough to chase you away then I have some pretty bad news about the whole internet...\n\n&gt; I sadly will not ever be partaking in this community ever again.\n\nDon't let me be the one to chase you out. I've posted here 2-3 times in total (now 4).\n\n*edit*: Replying to a post and immediately blocking someone is really cowardly. As for the \"like I'm stupid or something part\", you're reading stuff into my post that I never wrote. You'll have a happier time in life if you don't always interpret stuff people say in the most negative way possible.",

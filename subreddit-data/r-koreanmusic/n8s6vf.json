    "postText": "Hello!\n\nAny updates that occur within the subreddit, I will be sure to let you all know. As you may have noticed right away, there have been slight graphic/design changes - and I will be looking into updating such periodically. Please note that these updates are not necessarily 'permanent' and can be open for change/revisions based on general consensus. You are also encouraged to let us know if there is something that you see would best help this subreddit community, whether it may be through constructive opinions or suggestions - all are welcome.\n\n# Enacted List\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;1 - AutoModerator will now post both a 'Weekly Playlist Thread' as well as a 'Weekly Community Discussion' every Monday at 5:00 AM (and stay for the week). You are able to share your curated playlists, as well as ask questions and request within the approriate threads pinned at the top of the feed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2 - New title formatting has been implemented. Artist (Korean if Applicable) - Title (Korean if Applicable) (Year). Example; Hyukoh (\ud601\uc624) - Big Bird (\ud070\uc0c8) (2015). Incase you forget, the format is on the sidebar as well as before you post. Flairs indicate the genre that best fits the song and are already mandatory.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3 - There are three new content options to which you can help contribute to this community - Image Teaser, Video Teaser, and Album Review. If you actively follow an artist or group and hear about their upcoming release through an official source, feel free to share the image or video (direct links in highest quality) for us to know! Multiple photos should be clumped together in an album rather than posting seperately. Also, your personal Album Reviews are now allowed! Is there any album to which you either absolutely love or even have a physical copy of? Feel free to share a text post about the Album along with your critiques, thoughts, rating...etc. Please also include any information such as release year, genre, tracklist or anything you would find helpful. The post title format remains similar - Artist/Group (Korean if Applicable) - Album Title (Korean if Applicable) (Year of Release). Example; IU - Modern Times (2013). The three new content options have individual flairs for you to add on as well.\n\nLastly, a question I have to ask you all is regarding the content to which is allowed/disallowed. Any submission that is within the realm of 'Kpop' is currently in a gray area, as some have been allowed while others have not. Is there a fine line to which you all would like to see? If a song is under 'Kpop' but can be crossed over to other genres, would you be accepting of that? Example; Day6 intermixing with 'Kpop' and 'Rock'. Please do let me know of what you think!\n\nAs these three new implementations occur, I will be looking into which work/doesn't - as well as even more updates that will help grow this community. I am hoping that this will allow us to increase our community engagement! Once again, suggestions/comments will truly help - so do feel free to comment below of what you think. Anything in private - please message me or send a chat. *Thanks!*",

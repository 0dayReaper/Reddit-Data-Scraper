    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI have been looking into how to *improve* this community and *expand/increase* engagement within. This subreddit has long term been rather barren, and only a singular type of content (songs) being shared. A 'solution' to this that I am considering is changing the direction of r/koreanmusic to become a hub for new releases (and the information pertaining to it). This is the style and structure nearly all other music-based subreddits have. Currently, there are two other active subreddits that focus on a specific genre within the overarching realm of Korean music (Pop/Hip Hop) - however, since they are limited to the genre of focus), this subreddit would act as the filler to provide content on all of the other types of genres as well. This has been somewhat the case as the songs being shared currently are rather diverse (not just Pop/Hip Hop) - and have been a haven for genres that are immensely popular but neglected here on Reddit (Indie/Ballad). Before this becomes an essay, please take the short time to ***vote*** down below on the options provided regarding this subreddit's change of direction. If there is an option you would like to see or have comments/feedback/concerns - don't hesitate to let me know in the comments below! Thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/o7w612)",

                    "comment": "Initially, there was no Pop content allowed a while back - since the other major subreddit covers it and people (at the time) didn't want to see the same thing (here). However, some expressed that Pop within Korean music is far too expansive to outright \"ban\" - which is true to an extent. I think the majority would assume Korean Pop to be what we see often in the media and such (idols and groups), however, there are many unheard artists who do release music under the Pop genre that are not within the general scope (meaning they often experiment and cross genres - or release songs that some may think is Indie but is rather Pop). The same is applicable to Hip-hop, since (in my opinion) Korean Hip-hop tends to often have a mix of genres where it can be confusing to distinguish a sole genre that overwhelmingly represents it (example; Epik High - Can You Hear My Heart, OST? Ballad? Hip Hop?). If the majority wants, we could simply \"ban\" the obvious ones - but have the gray area be available so that some songs (within both genres) be an exception. Thanks for asking u/starry23!",

For me I don't mind if pop &amp; hip hop are still allowed here because I agree as well as they can both be expansive and experimental. I really hope others who have ideas/thoughts chime in as well. I love the idea of giving the spotlight of songs that fall under indie/ballads (esp ballads because I feel they are underappreciated).",

But I love that this sub focuses on the genres that don't get as much attention. Especially indie. K-indie outside of the popular artists can be hard to track down sometimes! I'm kind of rambling lol, but I admire the dedication you have to this and that you want to improve things! I'm excited to see so many people voting and leaving comments\\~",

You're absolutely right in the fact that there are many idols who do not get the spotlight often and do also release music themselves that could be within other genres. Perhaps I worded my statement wrong, but I would most likely go about having a *more* strict filter for pop content simply because it's the one area that could be easily abused and/or overshadow the primary focus of showcasing actual *lesser-known* artists (from other genres) - instead of it being an outright ban. Thanks again for bringing it up.",

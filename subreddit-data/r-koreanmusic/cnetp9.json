Since  then, his death became a mystery death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DEUX - One of the first K-hiphop group](https://preview.redd.it/8d9j33lvi4f31.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f65b7be541e3576769e461b6f189605c600c50f5)\n\n \n\nKim sung-jae debut as Hip-Hop group named \u201cDEUX\u201d in 1993.\n\nDEUX(Kim Sung-jae &amp; Lee Hyeon-do) was one of the first generation of  K-HIPHOP group with Seo Taiji boys. They introduced Hip-hop music in  Korea. They were very fashionable as well. DEUX became one of the most  famous group in Korea.\n\nThey were icons of 90\u2019s, not just singers. (Untill now, many artists did a cover on his song)\n\nIn 1995, they decided to split up to chase their dreams. Lee Hyeon-do  wanted to be a producer, and Kim Sung-jae wanted to remain as a singer.  They still supported each other.\n\nLee Hyeon-do produced Kim Sung-jae\u2019s solo album, and finally 1995, November 19th,\n\nKim Sung-jae had the first solo debut stage.\n\n# However, after his successful first solo debut stage, he was found dead around 3 AM, on November 20th in a hotel he stayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kim Sung-Jae's first and last solo debut stage-\\\\\"As I told you\\\\\"](https://reddit.com/link/cnetp9/video/kyzkrsphk4f31/player)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BTS covered Kim Sung-Jae's solo-\\\\\"As I told you\\\\\"](https://reddit.com/link/cnetp9/video/qp2pj2mlk4f31/player)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nWhen the police investigated, they came to the conclusion that his death was **\u201cSuicide\u201d**\n\nHowever, his mother didn\u2019t accept or belive that her son would suicide. Her son\u2019s death was seem to be very strange to her.\n\nFirstly, she said he always slept topless when he goes to sleep, but he  was dressed when he died and he still had his stage make-up on.\n\nSecondly, she said he was a right-handed, but there were 28th injection needle marks on his right arm.\n\nThirdly, she said he was afraid of needles, so he didn\u2019t like going to hospitals.\n\nBut mostly, he talked to his mom on the phone after his stage (on the  same day of his death). He told his mom that he was very happy about his  performance and he promised his mom that he will be coming home the  next day.\n\nHis future was very bright, there were no reasons that he would suicide.\n\nHis mom decided to do an autopsy on his body, and the truth came out.\n\nAfter the autopsy, drug named **\u201cZoletil\u201d** was found in his body and his death was caused by the drug.\n\nIn fact, his ex-girlfriend was in the same hotel with him and his crew on the day he passed away.\n\nAccording to his manager, she was the last person who stayed with him before he died.\n\nWhen his crews went to sleep, his manager saw that she was the last person who stayed with him.\n\nBut, she claimed that she went home around 3:30 AM.\n\nDuring the further investigation, police found out that she bought the  drug named \u201cZoletil\u201d from the animal hospital. She was a student of  dental school, so she could easily purchase those drugs.\n\nThe owner of the animal hospital also testified that she told him not to  tell anyone that she bought Zoletil from the animal hospital.\n\nPolice arrested her as a charge of murder suspect. She admitted that she  bought Zoletil, but she said not for the murder, it was to euthanasia  for her dogs.\n\n**When the First sentencing happened she got life imprisonment, but, the second and third sentencing she was found not guilty...**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Suspect-Kim Sung-Jae's Ex girlfriend](https://preview.redd.it/uq5n038dl4f31.jpg?width=244&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=059ba68291693647628eb2078ca0e0c4717c7900)\n\n \n\nThe first trial court of the case accepted the prosecution's claim and sentenced her to life imprisonment for murder.\n\nAccording to the ruling, she had a severe conflict with him, such as  shooting a gas gun or binding his body with strings and tapes while  fighting him because she was usually possessive and obsessed.\n\nHe suddenly left to United States on July 1995 to shoot his solo debut  music video and to clear his relationship with her because he thought it  might interfere with singer career in the future.\n\nAt this time, she tried to recover the relationship by calling, but he  avoided the phone calls. When he returned home, she said, \"I will study  in Japan soon, so please meet me until I leave to Japan.\" After that,  the two met again, and she felt that his heart  had already turned, and the first trial court ruled that he decided to  kill him with the desire to own him forever.\n\nHowever, the appeals court acquitted her, saying that Kim Sung-jae and  her had a good relationship and had no motive for murder. The gas gun  was a mistake, and the string-strap case was a joke. They had been  fighting since April 1995, but they had still been  in a relationship, and they had made dozens of calls a month in the  United States, with 63 calls are the most calls they had ever had in a  month.\n\nThe court said, \"If he did not want to receive her phone call, this  conversation would not be possible. When he returned from the United  States, he met her before his mother and prepared a gift. On the day of  his death, she had time for his own time, such as  giving a massage to him. The court said, \"When she is identified as a  criminal, I suspect that he exaggerated the quarrel or fight that can be  seen in lovers in hostility.\"\n\nThe appellate court also saw that the amount of Zoletil, a sleeping pill  for animals, was less than enough to kill a person, and the  prosecution's estimated time of death was also wrong.The prosecution  appealed against the results of the second trial, but the  Supreme Court also said that the judgment was right.\n\nHowever, his mother asserted totally differently.\n\nAccording to her, he really wanted to stop seeing her since her  obsession became crazy. When she told him that she is leaving to Japan  soon, he was very happy. The mother said. His mother also testified that  he said he will meet her for a week until she leaves  to Japan, as she begged, then he will be free.\n\nHowever, the fact that she is leaving to Japan was a lie.\n\nAccording to his manager, she called his hotel as crazy when he was in  the United State. Kim Sung-jae avoid to speak with her, and even asked  the manager to tell her that he is not here. According to his family and  friends, she was close to the stalker.\n\nShe seemed like she couldn\u2019t move on from him.\n\nHowever, after his death, his fans also found out that her family is  very wealthy and connected to politics as well. They assumed that why  she could turn her sentence from life imprisonment to not guilty.\n\n**His mystery death destroyed his family after he died.**\n\nUntil now, his family and fans have been fighting for the truth of his  death and the wrong judgment of her sentence, but that wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n#  Recently, SBS TV  show called \u201cI want to know\u201d, collected the evidence of his death and  they were about to broadcast the mystery death of Kim Sung-jae. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rs8x8z8m4f31.jpg?width=601&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dda215dd9a9027cf58d814b2f8516772386960a8\n\n  \n\nHowever, the court banned  the episode of TV show \"I want to know\" about his death, because she requested so that it doesn't affect injury to her honor.\n\nHis family and nations are now angry and upset, because it seems like her family power is still applied, and the court  don\u2019t want to show their embarrassing of judgment in the past.\n\nPlus, they are blocking the people\u2019s rights and freedom of speech.\n\n**Above all, the fact is that suspect is now living as a dentist in her husband\u2019s hospital.**\n\n**She married a doctor and living a happy life with her husband and two kids.**\n\n**Nations are now even progressing the national petition to release the broadcast**   \n **\u201cI want to know\u201d regarding his \u201ctrue\u201d death.**\n\nIt has been 24 years since he passed away and his family lived in pain after his death.\n\nHis family and fans are still asking and want to know the truth of his death.\n\nThey also want people to remember about his death, **since it could be your idol.**\n\nNow, it is time to determine his death and give the truth and most importantly, give peace to his family and fans.\n\n# ***Please share this story to help to find out about his death Thank you.***\n\n@deuxsns",

I do not think she has released anything at all (other than the song someone else posted earlier). The clip above is a competition show where many people tried out and is episode 3 or 4. Here is a link to the show page, there are a few other clips with her in them, but you may need to use a VPN or be in Korea to watch them; https://program.kbs.co.kr/2tv/enter/3gasu/pc/list.html?smenu=f96daf\n\nedit: The show is also on Kocowa: https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/34668178/the-legend-the-new-singer",

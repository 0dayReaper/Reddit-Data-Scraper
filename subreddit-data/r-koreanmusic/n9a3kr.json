But I'd like to expand what I know and sadly my knowledge of Korean artists is severely lacking. As such, I am looking for suggestions or some of your favorites, whether they're considered mainstream or not.\n\nI'm fairly open to just about any genre, though I lean more towards Rock and Pop with those I do like. In terms of who I do like from the Korean side of things, 2NE1 is so far the only group I've really dug into. (I have yet to really give BTS a try). So tell me who you love and what's a song of theirs that you like! I really do want to expand my music library to include more Korean artists!\n\n(If this is not the right place for this, please let me know!)",

It's incredibly expansive, and there are many artists/groups who do tend to incorporate a mix of multiple genres (even 2NE1 and BTS) resulting in unique styles. Feel free to search around the subreddit using the flairs to specify based on your interest. I am looking into ways to make the archive structure even easier/more efficient - as well as other community-engaging threads and such in the nearby future, so by then hopefully other users can chime in as well! Any questions or comments - feel free to message/chat me anytime and I will do my very best to provide an answer/solution.",

I would hope you are fluent in Korean first off - but factor in that each streaming service differs, as some have a community-ran approach while others are done by the company employees internally (and quite difficult to contact). I wish I could help/give a direct answer, but good luck!",

I hope later on more people can use the discussion post more often. \n\nI delved into Busker Busker earlier this month because I didn't know they disbanded years ago. I love their 1st album and Cherry Blossom Ending is so beautiful. \n\nWith Stella Jang I'm almost done listening to her discography I'm just missing her 1st album and the remaining singles after it. I wish I didn't sleep on her music for so long, it so up my music preferences I love it. \n\nBacklog list is long. I have plans to listen to 10cm, ADOY, Ben, Coffee Boy, The Black Skirts, Jung Seung Hwan, Koyote, Lyn Sweden Laundry, Uhm Jung Hwa, Younha and honestly the list goes on.",

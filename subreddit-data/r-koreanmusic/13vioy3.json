    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to get more familiar with Korean music, but I\u2019m having a hard time finding Korean music in the genres that I enjoy; I\u2019ve just been coming across a bunch of k-pop, which I\u2019m not a big fan of. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could recommend some Korean music that sounds more like my favorite genre, which is funk or funk rock. \n\nI\u2019ll list some of my favorite artists below. Anything recommendations that resemble these artists\u2019 style would be greatly appreciated. \n\nSly and the Family Stone \nParliament \nFunkadelic \nFishbone \nFrank Zappa \nPrince\nLiving Colour \nFaith No More\n311 \nJane\u2019s Addiction \nPorno for Pyros\nPrimus \nSublime \n\nI also like psychedelic rock, and I\u2019ve attached a song by Sanullim that I enjoy. Any recommendations similar to that song would be good too.",

Concorde is a great more recent band, won best rock album at the korean music awards this year.",

Here it is again, but separated by commas so it\u2019s easier to read: Sly and the Family Stone, Parliament, Funkadelic, Fishbone, Frank Zappa, Prince, Living Colour, Faith No More, 311, Jane\u2019s Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Primus, Sublime",

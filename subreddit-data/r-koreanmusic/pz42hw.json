            "comment": "Hi, I hope this is the correct place to post this. I came across this performance by Jo In Sung (Korean actor) and I fell in love with this song. But I don\u2019t understand Korean (nor can I recognize it over other related languages like Japanese) and I cannot for the life of me find the actual song to download. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s originally by another artist but I can\u2019t find that either. It may be a Korean song a Japanese song or maybe is popular in both Korean and Japanese and it seems like he performed it in the Philippines. It says it\u2019s called \u2018My Song\u2019 but googling that gets me no where. I need help please!! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=70GSDj_T3Ak",

On episode 3 titled \"Nice to meet you, traditional liqours\" at 1:05:14 into the episode a song starts playing that i'd really like to find. I can't read Korean but it does look like they say the artist and song name at the start but I can't find it on Youtube at all. They display \"Seoul Night\" \"Han Jeong-hui\" any help would do. Thank you.",

I tried to look for myself but all I found was missing and ex or missing a family member. I\u2019m looking for a Korean song (singer does not have to be mainstream) about missing someone you\u2019re in a relationship with but live or are traveling very far away from them. \n\nTo clarify, I haven\u2019t heard nor found any song like this but am looking to the community for help in finding one. Any help would be hugely appreciated!!!",

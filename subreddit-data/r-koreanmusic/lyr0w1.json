I just released my 2nd EP titled \u201cDEAD OR ALIVE\u201d and it features PARK HYEON JIN and Asthma (Lee Dohun) from High school rapper 4! It also features many other talented underground Korean rappers/singers. I\u2019m an up and coming artist, so I wanted to share my music to get my name out there. Let me know what you think! It\u2019s got a mix of rock, hip hop, indie, jazz and other genres! \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/5lrejWqWzDhk1J4lwvzm2t?si=4ersWfWjS4GdM5aDml7gkw\n\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-or-alive-ep/1554628628",

My influences are Jay Park, DPR Live and Offonoff!\n\nI don\u2019t know how everyone is doing, but staying creative indoors and finding inspiration during the prolonged lockdown period has been challenging, to say the least. I found comfort through music and it gave me the courage to make music that might help someone else.\n\nWith that being said, I just released a new EP and would love to get some thoughts and feedback from the community \ud83d\udc9b\n\nEP \\[something to look forward to.\\]\n\n[ttps://open.spotify.com/album/3LHUqmwcXbA6OrGkm9rbSy](https://open.spotify.com/album/3LHUqmwcXbA6OrGkm9rbSy)\n\nThank you, and as always, stay safe guys!",

My influences are Jay Park, DPR Live and Offonoff!\n\n  \nI\u2019ve been making music for about 3 years now and today... I\u2019m excited to announce that my very FIRST MUSIC VIDEO is finally out! The team has been working on this for the last 2-3 months and I\u2019m so thrilled to share this one with you guys.\n\n  \nFor all the Korean music enthusiasts out there, if you could give it a listen and let me know your thoughts or any feedback, it\u2019d be much appreciated \ud83e\udd0d\n\n  \nThank you everyone and stay safe!",

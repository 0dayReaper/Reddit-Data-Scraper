The group [Honey](https://youtu.be/LAOT6JscCVU) [Popcorn](https://youtu.be/JJHflZyMhtE) may be close to what you're looking for? \n\nI made a playlist on Spotify that has various bubblegum kpop. Maybe you could skim through that and see if it has anything similar to it? [Playlist link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ovpc2OnI7ZPDjHS6ptpOa?si=2ac766a1e4d64772)!",

[This one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0JVolwMvshHKMK3QYYg6oH?si=ea92f9661d5d47a4) is a lot more chill and acoustic. [This one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Kije0ZjTCQ5uo4Zt5RHFW?si=9117581276da40cc) is also very chill, but overall has a more jazz pop vibe. \n\nThere's also this site called [Spotalike](https://spotalike.com/)! You can plug in a song by an artist and it generates a playlist of 50 songs similar to that song! It's pretty awesome. You could try typing in Vincent Blue and see what songs are available :)",

They are amazing and I'm loving their solo works as well (and I'm really hoping they have a comeback very very very soon as a group)! I'm definitely now an ahgase!!!\n\nAs much as I love them, however, I'm really wanting to expand my KPop playlist. I'm starting to venture more into BIGBANG, but I'd also like to give BTS a try, as well as any other bands people love!\n\nAny recommendations for BTS in particular or even similar sounds in the KPop world?",

It is an extremely large playlist of 471 songs with different genres. I will upload more that deserves to be in this playlist.\n\n#FAQs\n\n#*Q: How did I select these songs?*\n\nA: I have selected these songs through the Korean music site Melon. They have a feature that looks into the top 100 songs in each year from 1964 to 2020. My only condition to these selection was that the songs must have 1000 likes in order to be selected. \n\n\n#*Q: Will  I make any more old school K-Pop playlists in the future?*\n\nA: I am currently in the process of creating another playlist. Will post it as soon as it's completed.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!!",

            "comment": "# [Hidden Gem Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsabXnLoK3qpTE3tnNLNVc7AiXJsWoJKJ)\n\nI think 90% of these songs have less than 50k views and quite a few have under 5k. Genre-wise it's a bit of everything, mostly chill songs. I would say Seori &amp; Alice Vicious are the only well known artists here (and perhaps PONY, ahem the Makeup artist). Tried to keep to a 1 song limit for each artist.\n\n---\n\nA few of my favourites:\n\n* [Hen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLU1dp51kng): quite a well known composer, doing a lot of OSTs and songs for other artists. Most known for composing [Lee Sora - Into my heart (Encounter OST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq0I0qLk4po). She has a nice voice but doesn't seem to have much desire atm for promoting her own songs.\n* [3rd Coast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gk2xQzc9s&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mOHaErS4QLbfL2vuxmaoXRim3Bno1_R6Q): Group which was active around 2006-2010ish. Mostly known for their songs in djmax but their albums are truly amazing. Some of their stuff is similar to Clazziquai (check em out too if you don't know about them).\n* [KitschRecord](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsabXnLoK3qpQ0Fvm7HG48soJekHFzZqu): Posted this album here a while ago. Soloist Noh Yuri only released this album and 2 other songs but it's one of my favourite albums. I think Noh Yuri's tone is really unique. Most of the songs on this album were composed by Hen.\n* [Stellarjet - Hate Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RP8wvQ0cgc): Probably the most underrated song on here. Idk how this only has 3.9k views (and 8.8k views on Mirrorball). Listening to it now, **Like how?!**\n\n---\n\nVery curious to see if anyone recognizes any of these artists or better yet heard any of these songs before!",

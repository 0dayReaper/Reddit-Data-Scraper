            "comment": "Trot singer Song Gain, who has majored in traditional Korean music (gugak) and comes from a family of traditional musicians, appealed to the public [via Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdXKOakJkHx/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and shared the information for a concert in protest of the draft for a new music curriculum: \n\n\"If the opportunity to learn even a little about our country, the things that are ours, and traditional music, disappears, what on earth should our students grow up learning?\" \"I hope you will make a clearer judgement than the Ministry of Education officials that our history and traditions shouldn't be touched!\" \n\nEarlier this month, a total of 12 Intangible Cultural Heritage Masters and dozens of educators gathered Wednesday in southeast Seoul to protest a newly proposed school curriculum, calling it a \u201cmassacre of gugak.\u201d [(The Korea Herald)](http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220504000707&amp;ACE_SEARCH=1). \n\n&gt;\u201cWe have devoted our lives with pride to maintaining the national culture. Our efforts were recognized in the form of \u2018human cultural heritage\u2019 but we recently heard that gugak-related parts will be omitted in the upcoming music curriculum,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cOur honor as Intangible Cultural Heritage Masters means nothing when our younger generations cannot learn gugak.\u201d\n\n&gt;Currently, the 2015 edition of music curriculum for elementary, middle and high schools devotes about 30 to 40 percent to traditional Korean music.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe don\u2019t demand too much -- just maintain the level of gugak education at the current level,\u201d Jung Eun-gyeong, a music professor at Busan National University of Education, said. \u201cThe research team that is drafting a new curriculum is biased because four out of five of them have majored in Western music,\u201d Jeong added.\n\n&gt;Jeong explained that the new draft omits some gugak concepts and removed a mandate to teach gugak. \n\n&gt;The Ministry of Education rebutted the gugak musicians and educators\u2019 claim and said that it is trying to make a balanced curriculum and the second phase of the drafting process will begin later this year.\n\n&gt;The group warned of a bigger protest on May 15, which is Teacher\u2019s Day.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe rarely gather to protest like this. But this is an extremely important cause for us and we will perform in protest that day with our students,\u201d Moon said.",

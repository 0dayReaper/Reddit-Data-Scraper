One version has Hangul and the other has Romanized lyrics\n\nThe sheet music is a transcription, not arrangement. It's been a hot minute since I've dabbled in Korean so if there's something wrong with the Hangul/Romanization someone let me know\n\nI freelance as a transcriber so if there\u2019s no sheet music for a song, hit me up and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out",

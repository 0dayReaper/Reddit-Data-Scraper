    "postText": "Hello!\n\nThe results for the week-long poll have shown that the majority (of those who had voted) wanted to see the change in direction - therefore starting today, there will be a major shift in the content being posted. In case you missed what the direction was in particular, posts can now be updates/new releases (both content and information). *You will still be able to share older content per usual and should view this change as an addition*. Here are some key points you should be aware of.\n\n* Proper title formatting (rule 2) for any/all music will still be applied, Artist - Korean Title (English Translation) (Year). In regards to news/information updates, it will be up to you - however, please ensure that there is proper grammar/capitalizations and that it summarizes whatever the content is about.\n* Sources can be rather diverse, but should ideally come from either the artist/group themselves or the agency/management. Tabloids, unverified/unofficial blogs, and fan content are not allowed. Whether the source is an image or video, it should be direct and in the highest quality to which you are able to obtain (rule 6).\n* New flairs (News, Image Teaser, Video Teaser) have been added, therefore please apply them accordingly! If there is any flair you find missing, feel free to let me know.\n\nSince this is rather new, there will be changes implemented as I see what works/doesn't. I will also be looking into user flairs for everyone to add, so be on the lookout for that as well. For any questions or comments - don't hesitate to let me know.",

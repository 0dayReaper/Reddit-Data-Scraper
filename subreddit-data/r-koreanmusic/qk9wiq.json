But it was about this Korean guy who was a firefighter and a Korean girl who was working at a dry cleaners, she had a crush on him but never got the courage to ask him out.  They lived in New York and it was September 11th 2001.  The video was sweet and then turned very sad but I cant for the life of me remember the name of it.",

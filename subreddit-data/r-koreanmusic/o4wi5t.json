    "postText": "Hello! Welcome to the first Weekly Album Spotlight here on r/koreanmusic.\n\nEvery week on Monday, I will share an album from the many different genres and artists/groups in hopes you discover something new and/or expand your knowledge within the vast world of Korean music. If you are interested in submitting an album you thoroughly enjoy and would like others to know (about it) as well - don't hesitate to let me know and I can get it scheduled. This week, I will be spotlighting an **EP** by **IU** titled **'*****A Flower Bookmark*****'** under the ***Ballad &amp; K-pop genre*** which was released on **May 16, 2014**. This EP is a bit different than usual - in the sense that she had covered a selection of pop songs that were incredibly popular from the 1980s to 1990s. Due to the nostalgia effect, it went on to be widely successful - helping to propel her existing &amp; rising fame and diversify the listeners - closing in generational gaps (of IU) within Korea. This is her fourth EP, in between Modern Times (2013) and Chat-Shire (2014) with '\ub098\uc758 \uc61b\ub0a0 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 (My Old Story)' being the lead single. \n\nTracklist \n\n1. \ub098\uc758 \uc61b\ub0a0 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 (My Old Story) **(Jo Deok-bae -1985)**\n2. \uaf43 (Flower) **(Kim Kwang-seok - 1991)**\n3. \uc090\uc5d0\ub85c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9b4 \ubcf4\uace0 \uc6c3\uc9c0 (Pierrot Smiles at Us) **(Kim Wan-sun - 1990)**\n4. \uc0ac\ub791\uc774 \uc9c0\ub098\uac00\uba74 (When Love Passes By) **(Lee Moon-sae - 1987)**\n5. \ub108\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 (The Meaning Of You) **(Sanulrim - 1984)**\n6. \uc5ec\ub984\ubc24\uc758 \uafc8 (Dreams In Summer Night) **(Kim Hyun-sik - 1988)**\n7. \uafcd\ub530\ub9ac \uc0e4\ubc14\ub77c (Boom Ladi Dadi) **(Clon - 1996)**\n8. LP Extra - \uc5b4\ud5c8\uc57c \ub465\uae30\ub465\uae30 (Uhuya Doongi Doongi) **(Lee Moon-sae - 1985)**\n\nI absolutely recommend you to check out the original artists (bolded) to whom she had covered, and the endless amount of songs by each artist/band as they are ***truly iconic*** within the Korean music scene/spectrum (a top tier list for those who are interested in delving into 'vintage' Korean music). Lee Moon-sae and Kim Kwang-seok are two that I find listening to quite often, both staples/foundational individuals with incredible lyrical depth. Out of the album, I personally enjoyed '*My Old Story*' and '*Dreams In Summer Night*' the most - as the style really helps IU's soft voice shine and set the tone/ambiance (alone, late evening - looking into the city/town). I also suggest you check out '*Pierrot Smiles at Us*' as it is very experimental and unique (to IU at the time) and could be considered a precursor to IU's shift into contemporary/experimental pop we eventually see (away from her usual fantasy-like pop). If you had already listened to this album, which songs are your favorite and why? Are there any artists whom she had covered that you already know of? The floor is all yours, open for discussion! Any feedback on formatting or how this will 'work' - feel free to let me know as well.",

            "comment": "My favorites are Pierrot Smiles at Us and Meaning of You. Overall it is a really solid mini album and each song is a 10/10 in my book. With Pierrot Smiles At Us I love how smooth it is and the piano keys throughout the song really elevates it imo. Meaning of You just is a sweet song and it is just the perfect song to listen on drive on your way home from work. \n\nAs for the originals I've only listened to Pierrot Smiles at Us and I was very surprised that they are almost two different songs. I enjoy the band 'breaks' in the original that IU eventually replaces with her version with the piano keys. (Hope that makes sense). \n\nI wish I gave this album a listen sooner because it is great and I think there is something for everyone in this album. Can't wait for the next album spotlight :D",

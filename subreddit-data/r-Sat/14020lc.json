Any books I should use? The content is pretty similar so I can reuse the paper sat books as well right?",

Did you find one?\n\nThere are many external resources - many that are  specific to the digital test will be coming out shortly. Older books for the paper SAT are very applicable to the Math section. R&amp;W has changed meaningfully - old books cover the concepts but digital-specific books should have better practice questions",

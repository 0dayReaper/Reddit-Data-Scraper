    "postText": "Im new to this whole thing about sending SAT scores. Just wanted to clarify some things: If I don\u2019t send the scores for free to colleges do I have to pay a fee to send them? If so, how much per college? Does each college I am applying to need a SAT score sent to them? Why can\u2019t I just send them the pdf with the official score? Do I really have to send the SAT scores through College Board website if I am applying to 30 colleges?",

So you simply input the numerical value of the score when you are applying into a text box and nothing more than that.\n\nHowever, there are some schools which don't take self reported scores and require an official score report which would cost $12.\n\nIt is unlikely that the majority of the colleges you plan to apply to will require official score reports. Most of them allow self reporting. But check the admissions website of each college to know for sure.",

I'm almost certain that there is no part where you are going to be calculating what your GPA is. You should just be reporting what is already given. \n\nIf the grade says 99.98, you input 99.98.

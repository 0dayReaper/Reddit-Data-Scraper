            "comment": "the triangles aren't similar because the base of 4 on triangle OED is not the same as the base of 3 on triangle DBA. You would have to set this as a base proportion of 4/3 = 3/x  , with x being side AB. you then get that AB = 9/4 . now you can plug the a and b values of triangle DBA into the pythagorean theorem a^(2) \\+ b^(2) = c^(2) to be 9/4^(2) \\+3^(2) = c^(2) . when you solve this, you should get 3.75 for c, being AD.",

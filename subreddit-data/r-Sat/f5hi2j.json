My highest practice score was like 1510 or 1520. I had an average of 1500 for my practice tests.\n\nI just sat down testing day and just fucking aced it out of nowhere. I think a big part of my success was I was very confident and relaxed going into the test, I tried to minimize my nervousness as much as possible. The simultaneous pressure from the SAT being real + my still relaxed attitude just made me somehow totally in the zone lmao. I was also blessed with an easy math section.",

I took the test on December 7th.\n\nI studied intensely throughout September and most of October (every day, at least 30 min on KhanAcademy). Then I started slacking through November (stopped studying every day). However, I did try to take a practice test every weekend. Occasionally this was impossible due to other factors, but I fairly consistently took a practice test every weekend, totalling up to 11 practice tests.",

    "postText": "I get 1280 (Eng:580 , Math:700) from previous DSAT and going to attend second test 5 days later. But I don't expect to get more than my previous score. I am international student with 0 AP and 3.7 GPA. Can I get accept from any university in top 200?. I would like to get scholarship but I don't expecting that with my score. I will study CS Major. Can I get accept from PennState, ASU or Purdue? Which university would you suggest?",

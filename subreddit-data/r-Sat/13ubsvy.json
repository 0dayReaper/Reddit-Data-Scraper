            "comment": "if they give you a side ratio and ask about the volume ratio-you cube the side ratio to get the volume ratio.  Here they give you the volume ratio and you have to take the cubed root of the volume ratio to get the side ratio.  First you can reduce the volume by dividing by 12 so you have a volume ratio of A to B is 8 to 1.  Now take the cubed root of the volume ratio so the side ratio is 2 to 1.  Since the question says the side length of prism A is 6, then the corresponding side length of prism b is 3",

            "comment": "volume is a side cubed\n\neven tho it says it is a rectangle prism we can think of it as a cube because the concept of volume won't change\n\nv=s^3 where v is the volume and s is a side\n\nprism A has a volume that is 8 times the volume of prism B\n\nplug back into the equation and we get 8=s^3\n\nsolve for s, and we get s=2\n\nthis means that prism A has sides that are 2x or twice the length of prism B.\n\n6/2 is 3. therefore, the answer is 3.",

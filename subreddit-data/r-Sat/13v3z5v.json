    "postText": "hi! i'm currently a rising junior and as the next school year approaches, i'm getting ready for the psat (and sat, of course). my sophomore year psat, i got a 1320/1520. to make national merit next year, though, i'll need a 1480+/1520, since the index in new jersey is super high. when going through practice tests and other materials of the sort, i find the math section super easy, except for the fact that i often struggle to remember common formulas, such as slope, arc-related stuff, etc. in order to remember them, i'm trying to compile a list and memorize them all. please reply to this post with formulas/rules that you see pop up the most in psat/sat questions so that we can all memorize them!",

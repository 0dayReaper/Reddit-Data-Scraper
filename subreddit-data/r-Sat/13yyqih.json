Along my process I took the test in 3 different states. Today I was notified that college board cancelled my test due to 'no motive' Has this ever happened to anyone? If so can I show up to test site and be admitted to take the exam?",

If this is true, you should contact CB and have them document it for future registration. They don\u2019t want non-high-school students taking the test for no reason - it often indicates someone intending to steal the test questions/help others to cheat.\n\nAt best, they allow non-standard testers only in QAS months, when the test will be released to the public. US October is the only one remaining. Digital testing doesn\u2019t seem to allow it at all.",

First and last each sentences contain main ideas and also show you how the passage shifts. \n\nAlso make sure that questions line up with your answer very closely and not just part of your answer. Like if it asks how the narrator feels about someone. You need to find something talking about how they feel or that is very close, no exceptions. Then the next questions is usually which lines support it. When you have one of those questions and the following question is about which line supports it, Don\u2019t read through the lines first. The Sat people are like hoping you will do that and mess yourself up.",

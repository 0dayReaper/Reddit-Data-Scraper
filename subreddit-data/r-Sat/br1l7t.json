When I talk to my student's parents, and sometimes the students themselves, I have to remind them that the world is not ending.  I also have to remind parents that their kids will be moving out soon, so they should appreciate those last few months.  It makes me sad to see kids and parents fighting for the last year or two of their lives together.\n\nI know most of the people on r/sat are students, so I have some advice:  try not to stress yourself out too much.  It won't help you, and where you go to college matters less than everyone is telling you.  If your parents are making things worse, try to tell them that.  They might not listen, but just hang in there.",

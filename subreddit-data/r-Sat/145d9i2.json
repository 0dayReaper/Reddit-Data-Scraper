            "comment": "Okay so you now the maximum height (784) was reached at 7 seconds. That gives you the vertex and you can write the function in its canonical form y = (a*(x - Xv)\u00b2 + Yv), where Xv is the X coordinate of the vertex (7) and Yv is the Y coordinate of the vertex (784). So now you can write it as y = a*(x-7)\u00b2 + 784, but .... You need the value of a to be able to plug in the 3. How do we find a? We know that it was released from a height of 0 and as soon as it's released it means that the time is also 0, it's the start. So, that gives us the point (0,0). Now we plug in that point in our almost finished equation.\n\nWe have:\n\n0 = a(0-7)\u00b2 + 784\n\n0 = 49a + 784\n\n-784 = 49a\n\n-784/49 = a\n\n-16 = a\n\n(Fun fact: a should be negative in order to have a maximum. If a is positive, you'd have a minimum)\n\nOkay, so now we have the full equation\n\nY = -16 * (x-7)\u00b2 + 784\n\nNow we plug in the 3\n\nY = -16 * (3 -7)\u00b2 + 784\n\nY = -16 * (-4)\u00b2 +784\n\nY = -16 * 16 + 784\n\nY = -256 + 784\n\nY = 528\n\n\nHope this helps and let me know if you need any more help! \n\nPs: If you ever need a tutor hmu \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

    "postText": "Yesterday, I received an email that says my score is canceled.\n\nBut I honestly haven't cheated.\nAre there anyways to get scores, or at least refund?\nHave you ever been in such a situation?\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nDear Khurshidbek,\n\nYour May 2023 SAT\u00ae scores have been canceled. This decision follows a comprehensive investigation by the College Board\u2019s test security experts who determined that testing misconduct occurred. These determinations are made only when there's clear and overwhelming evidence of misconduct such as direct observation of the test security violation by testing staff, analysis of answers that conclusively demonstrate copying or collusion, or a combination of these and other pieces of evidence.\n\nTest takers are bound by the College Board\u2019s policies and procedures, and as was made clear to you during the registration process, violations of the security terms and conditions can result in immediate dismissal from a test center, cancellation of scores, being banned from taking College Board assessments, and other potential consequences.",

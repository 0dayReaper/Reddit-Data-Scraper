    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m going to be appearing for a retake this August after having given the non digital version of the SAT last year. I\u2019ve taken a look at the main changes and the syllabus etc but I\u2019m a bit confused regarding practice. As far as I know, for initial practice and understanding of concepts, we should be using the old SAT workbooks etc + khan academy, and the bluebook for digital practice tests.\n\nCould somebody please let me know if my understanding is correct or what I should be doing differently? Also, aren\u2019t 4 full length official practice tests too little? As far as I know there are only 4 available for the new version. Kind of stressing, not sure how to study for this digital version. Would really appreciate some responses!",

            "comment": "4 practice is definitely enough. Remember to record your wrongs in a chart and analyze why you got them wrong and make sure you get it. Maybe do one practice on bluebook first to see where you are at, then watch the khan academy digital sat videos and do questions. Focus on your weakness. then do the rest and learn where you got wrong. For the math, a lot of the questions you don't need to calculate, just plug into the desmos graphing and you will have the answer. Make sure you are familiar with how to use desmos and how to graph to get answers.",

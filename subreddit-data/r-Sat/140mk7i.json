But don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy obviously.\n\nI got a 910 on March and now I\u2019m predicting a 1300-1350 for the June SAT. \n\nStudy smarter and not harder. An 870 is an indicator that you have to relearn most math concepts, learn grammar rules, and simply read more books to get better reading comprehension. If you put 2-3 hours 6 days a week with one rest day (make sure you have a study plan and not just study hard because that won\u2019t work) then I\u2019m very confident you\u2019ll reach a 1200 without a question. Then from there, you can keep climbing \ud83d\udcaa",

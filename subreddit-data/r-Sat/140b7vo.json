    "postText": "I\u2019ve been reading a lot in the June 3, 2023 Paper SAT discussion, apparently we got a repeat test from a year ago? That reading section and NC was awful compared to my last one I took, my question is if they reused the test will they reuse the curve? I understand it\u2019s predetermined and not based on other\u2019s scores but half the comments think that the curve has to be fantastic because this one really sucked, and the other half say that the curve will be reused from June, 2022 which was very unforgiving, if someone could lmk I\u2019d appreciate that.",

But here\u2019s another thing that I think should also be taken into consideration (sorry in case this upsets y\u2019all lol)\u2014since this test and thus answers were released through June 2022\u2019s NASH form, I\u2019d think that the College Board would make the curve worse in case some people studying for June 2023 used June 2022 to study and thus knew some of the answers in advanced, without ever knowing that June 2023 would be the same as June 2022 NASH. Again, this is sort of hypothetical, but I could see them lowering the curve for this reason. However, I think I also heard somewhere that June 2022 NASH didn\u2019t have a QAS, so maybe the high curve still is possible in case people weren\u2019t able to use it to study without it having a QAS.",

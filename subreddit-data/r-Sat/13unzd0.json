    "postText": "First of all, 410 is a score I put for fun lmao my actual score is 1470\n\nNow, what should I do with the first few questions on DSAT that request you to input the correct word? Module 2 words are just wow, I am unable to process these questions simply because I know not any of the words in the choices\n\nIs there anything I can do? Because I think these questions are pure luck if you don\u2019t know vocabulary, but idk I want to nail them because on practice 3 the system subtracted 50 points for 2 wrong answers and that\u2019s pretty scary (I got 680 on the English section with 8-9 errors imo)",

If anything it\u2019ll probably make it even harder. If colleges don\u2019t look at standardized tests, and GPA is becoming increasingly unreliable, what are colleges supposed to look at? Almost every other metric (essays, EC, etc.) is subjective, and when the number of applicants are increasing every year, it\u2019s gonna make it even tougher to stand out. I\u2019m not saying that the current system is perfect (far from it) but its a necessary compromise between objectivity and subjectivity. \"",

You disproved something that wasn\u2019t even my argument in the first place. I don\u2019t disagree with your statement but that would only hold true if comparing GPAs of students from the same school because it has the same rigor and grading scale. Some schools count a 90 as a 4.0 (which is ridiculous btw because getting a 90 is way too easy) and my school counts a 97 as a 4.0 (which makes it nearly impossible to get an unweighted 4.0 even though I\u2019ve gotten very close).",

Smarter students do better on it, but ones who get classes and resources will do better than students who are otherwise academically superior (theoretical holistic measurement). \n\nNot only that, but regardless of what school someone goes to, the costs of the SAT and potential additional prep will absolutely divide people who can and can't afford to deal with the whole mess. \n\nLastly, if you had a crappy freshman year, you'll manage man. I can't say for certain how much colleges value a rising gpa trend along with considering freshman year to be less important, but it's a factor. You'll do great.",

This is true of everything, though. School, ECs, essays, kids with more resources always do better. The problem is an overall one, not one limited to the scope of the SAT. \n\nAlso, plenty of kids with good resources tend to score far from the higher echelons of the SAT, so I\u2019d say the test does its job fairly well. The nationwide average is 1050ish, and it\u2019s not like every kid with a tutor is scoring 1550 or above either.

People who are scoring poorly on the SAT are a varying gradient of actually deserving it to just not having the resources to push to the top level of the test. If people want to get into a good engineering or medical school, that skewed proportion of scores for kids with resources starts to seriously matter. \n\nTo some degree, life will always be pay to win/pay to play. The SAT is better than GPA when it comes to comparing the 4.0 off acing home ec and senior year algebra 2, but my only point is that the test is flawed enough to not be a way of leveling the playing field.",

If you are not feeling confident, go for a state school. There are a lot of things you can (and have to) do during undergrad to make a good application for grad school, which is going to be more important in the long run. Put in your best effort, but don't stress yourself!",

My SAT and ACT at least get me on the table at the T20s. Standardized tests are already weighed much too lightly at most schools.

All devaluing the SAT does is guarantee the tiniest deviation away from a perfect 4.0 or not starting a $1M-in-sales business by age 16 increases your chance of your application getting thrown in the trash. The SAT is the great equalizer. You can\u2019t take that away from the normal everyday students like me who nearly killed themselves for a good score so some kids who have 4.0s and 1,000 ECs who \u201cdon\u2019t test well\u201d get into all 20 T20s instead of half.",

Like take someone like me who has bang average grades in one of the highest ranked public high schools in the state of California and the country, yet I would say I definitely put an above average effort to get these grades considering the rigor of my high school(the teachers, the grading etc.) Despite this,  I\u2019m being compared to people in relatively \u201ceasier\u201d high schools where the\u201dAP\u201d courses aren\u2019t even close to the rigor of regular courses at mine. And I understand a lot of colleges(especially UC\u2019s) take your high school ranking into consideration but a lot of colleges simply don\u2019t consider it that much. Whereas test scores are constant accross the country, so in that sense everyone is given the same difficulty and it can be seen as more representative.\n\nJust my thoughts, I do agree that one day of testing shouldn\u2019t decide your college admissions either so I really don\u2019t know.",

(Those who get excluded from a good opportunity) Hence additional metrics were added.\n\nIts a problem of scarcity. Because there are so few seats, that any change to the system is bad.\nCollege tuition has doubled. And colleges like Harvard are like rich like hedge funds, yet the availability of best education opportunity has not grown.\n\n\nBy the markets metrics kids that score such a low score should be working in fast food. But its commonly touted that people should be trained and educated for the jobs of the future. Except that since they didnt score a high SAT score they dont deserve an opportunity to learn at the best colleges that the United States has to offer.\n\nLet me remind you alot of fast food chains are looking to automate their employees and eventually reduce the number of the employees on their payroll because money.\n\nRight now the system is broken, while I don\u2019t necessarily agree with Yang on his stance about the SAT\u2019s, I can understand his viewpoint.",

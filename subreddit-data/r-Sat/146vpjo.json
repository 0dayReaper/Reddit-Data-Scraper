            "comment": "Had this exact score (600 reading, 730 math). Here's what I did, granted I did have a private tutor but I only used her to answer questions for the reading/writing section as self studying that is a bit harder. I took June SAT and feel pretty confident about it, and on practice tests i've been consistently scoring a 1580+.  \n\n\nFor math:  \nI used UWorld and grinded the topics that I struggled on the first attempt with. Yes, this option does cost money, but if you are willing to spend, I highly recommend it.  \n\n\nIf you cannot spend money, then khan academy for math will be your best friend. It will teach you all the concepts you need to know, but it won't teach you everything. Once you have a solid understanding of how to do the math, you then need to move on to practice tests. Simply doing the problems in khan academy isnt enough because its obvious what you have to do. You won't know where and when to use each equation on the real SAT, you need to find that out yourself. The most useful equation I can give you for the math section is this:  \n\n\nmath + weird = 75 seconds. The mixture of math and the confusingness of the question is designed to take you around 75 seconds. The SAT will never give you a question on the nocalc section that requires you to do 483 x 847 / 12. The SAT will also never give you an extremely confusing question that requires a lot of math either. If the wording of the question is weird and requires you to think a lot, chances are the math to do it is very simple.   \n\n\nReading and Writing:  \nIn my opinion, these sections are more of an IQ test, testing your pattern recognition ability, writing especially. Every writing question is a pattern. Learning the patterns and being able to identify what the question is asking is going to make it a million times easier. Khan academy can help with this because it tells you what the question is asking, but specific patterns and tricks can be taught by a tutor. Same with the reading. After you learn where the evidence for specific questions are, you reach a point where you can read the passage and have a good idea whether or not a sentence will be used in answering a question before even knowing what the questions are. This is where my tutor really helped, since she taught me what to look out for. If you can't afford a tutor, you can learn the patterns yourself by doing practice tests. Start with the 10 college board tests. Do a passage, and time yourself so you only have 13 minutes to do it. You want to start early with timing, otherwise it will be harder to adjust to it later. Then, after you finish the passage, spend another 15 minutes reviewing each question, whether you got it right or wrong. Write down what the question is asking, what the answer was, what you selected (if you got it wrong, explain why you thought your choice was the right one, and then explain why it was wrong. assumption, misread the text, etc.), then write down the evidence in the text that supports the correct answer. There will ALWAYS be evidence in the text. The SAT must make the test fair to everyone, so zero background knowledge is required. My best tip will be to never assume any extra info. Go into the passage with a blank slate as if you know nothing but how to read. If you do this for 2-3 hours a day over the next 2 months, you will definitely score a 1550. If you don't need that high of a score, you can do one passage a day and still most likely score a 1450. This level of prep is extremely intense, but if you're up for it, it will definitely pay off.",

Nonetheless, I will provide some tips. \n\nFirst, start using Khan Academy if you haven\u2019t already. It diagnoses what areas you are strong and weak in, and also provides practice tests that will help improve your score. Personally, I would also follow the 90 day prep course by Hayden Rhodea on YouTube as well.\n\nSecond, do individual research. For math, study up on Algebra and Pre-calc concepts such as Trigonometry, system of equations, functions, and more. For reading, try to consistently read scientific and complex texts alongside SAT reading textbooks such as Meltzer.\n\nAnd third, have discipline. The only true way to go above and beyond is to actually do the work. Schedule times to do practice tests. Be consistent with practice and study. If I wasn\u2019t clear enough before, let me say it again: THERE IS NO MIRACLE METHOD TO ACE THE SAT. \n\nIf you follow these tips, you will have a good chance of achieving the 1450 that you want. Good luck.",

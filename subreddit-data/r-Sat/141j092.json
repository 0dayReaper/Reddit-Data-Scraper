            "comment": "If you have some time like maybe at least 2 months then yeah you could. First I suggest doing an act practice test and seeing how it feels. There is a lot of overlap in terms of content for sat and act math and reading, but science is where you might get tripped up. And these aren\u2019t general knowledge science questions you\u2019ve seen in any regular science class, it is pretty specific to the act. Lastly, you should definitely be aware of the second main difference between the two: time. The act goes a lot quicker, and if you struggle with time management on the sat, I wouldn\u2019t even really bother with the act.",

There\u2019s no bonus to having two scores.",

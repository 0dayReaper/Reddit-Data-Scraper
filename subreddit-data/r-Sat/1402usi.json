    "postText": "Whenever i started studying,my only goal was a good score to get a good scholarship in lebanon.  \nThen,i started noticing a change in my logical thinking,english has taught me how to analyze infos and conclude the best conclusion.  \nAlso,i taught myself how to control my stress(during last minutes on test,i was normally solving trying to answer right as many questions as i can)  \nAnd the moat important thing is the english skills i got from studying.as an arabic,i find english and its grammar and structures,but now i have a lot of skills in this language and im able to construct sentences as complicated as cb's sentences.  \n  \nAt the end of the day,look at yourself,look at how you changed after the test,because this is the real score",

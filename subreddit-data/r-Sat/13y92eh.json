    "postText": "I want to prepare for SAT exams from India and currently studying in 11th ISC. I haven't done much research hence I'm seeking you guys's help. Basically, I really am not interested in the JEE and NEET exams since I want to study abroad. Heard of SAT and the basic overview of it from one of my school mates who's also pursuing it. My question is that how should I prepare for the SAT exams, since I'm also studying for the ISC exam. Should I complete my ISC and then study for SAT or should I study for both of them parallely?",

            "comment": "Study both together.   \nSAT math is basically 7th-10th math by CBSE and ISCE board standards.   \nEnglish is a bit tougher. If you were in an english medium school, and in CBSE or ISCE, you'll have it a bit better, but even then, it runs entirely on technicalities with grammar. Not to mention, it uses \\*American Standard English\\*, which is not what we use in India; \\*British Standard English\\*",

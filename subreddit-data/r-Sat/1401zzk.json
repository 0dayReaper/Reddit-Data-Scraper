    "postText": "I have been having trouble with math on the SAT. And by trouble I mean not being able to even get past the first concept fully on Khan Academy\u2019s SAT prep. \n\nI\u2019m looking into tutoring options, any recommendations for good tutoring services? Looking into keplan\u2019s service right now.\n\nOther recommendations besides tutoring/any advice would also be greatly appreciated as I literally lost all hope and it seems like I\u2019m unable to do even basic math at this point. \n\nThanks!",

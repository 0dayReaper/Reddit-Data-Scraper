If you wanna see it, you can find Practice Test #10.  I\u2019ll post the link here through an edit.  I got a 730 in Math for missing 4, and I lost 20 points for 1 error in Writing, so it was pretty harsh overall.\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nEDIT: Here\u2019s the curve!  https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/scoring-sat-practice-test-10.pdf.

We haven't had much luck with great curves since the June 2018 administration.\n\nHave a nice day.",

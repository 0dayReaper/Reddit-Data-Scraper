When students see questions that don\u2019t look like what they practiced, they are often perceived as \u201chard\u201d.  Just as the practice questions were the first time they were used.\n\nI\u2019ve seen no systemic change in the raw score conversion process tht indicates test of higher raw difficulty. For the paper test.\n\nThe 2nd module of the digital test will be more difficult (or much easier) than past paper tests, by design.",

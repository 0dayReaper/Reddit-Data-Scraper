The overall gpa is bad so you could assume on inconsistencies and laziness",

I mean like lets say you do well on your SAT subject tests (over a 770), and your regular SAT(1550+), and like decent on AP Exams (like mainly 4s-5s with like a rare 3 or something). But then you come to the GPA. Your grades are like mainly B+ and if you're lucky some extremely low A-s(like 89.5s rounded to 90). And you put your best effort into the classes, they're just difficult and you got a C or F on like one of your 4 tests which in total are worth half your grade. You're kinda screwed at that point even if you understand everything.",

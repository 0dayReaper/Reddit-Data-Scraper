To find the area, you need to do length times width. You have the 30, so you multiply that by (x-30)/2, which is the length of the two sides you didn't get given the measurements for. So you get 30(x-30)/2\n\nat least that's what I did",

You know how to calculate the area of a rectangle, and using the conditions given in the question\u2013x is the sum of the other 3 sides\u2013just draw a small picture of a rectangle (I used side lengths 10 and 30, so the area should be 300). Since the sum of the other 3 sides is 10+10+30 = 50, simply plug 50 in for x and evaluate the answer choices. Surely enough, when we plug 50 in for this answer choice we get 30(50-30)/2 = 600/2 = 300. Hope that helps!",

However, I thought that there wouldn't be a comma because it's an independent clause + dependent clause. Can someone explain?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

In this case if you rearrange the sentence it would be \u201calthough it contains some older sections, London is a modern city\u201c and in this rearranged version, you can pretty easily identify that it would need a comma. I literally just made this up for myself and it\u2019s been working but idk don\u2019t quote me",

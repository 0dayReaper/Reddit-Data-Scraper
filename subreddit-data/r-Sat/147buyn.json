    "postText": "My strong suit is English, and I say this with every sincere fiber in my body, take AP Lang. I have never seen such DRASTIC improvements in my SAT score. I went from a 690 to a 780 through that class alone. It's really just a hack for the SAT, and its so, so useful. To every incoming junior, take it!!! \n\nNot only does the class make you a better writer, but it also teaches you hot to effectively argue and analyze an author's works. If youre not good at english, I highly recommend taking it to see improvements in your english scores. This is literally a hack for the english section.",

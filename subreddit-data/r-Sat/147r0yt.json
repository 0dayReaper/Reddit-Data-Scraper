Yes, digital SAT needs the scaled score equivalents so that a composite (400-1600) can be calculated by adding your r/w scaled score and your math scaled score - similar to how your reading score and writing score are multiplied by 10 and added to each other in order to calculate your r/w score and how your math score is multiplied by 20 to calculate your math score. Then, the scores are added to form a composite score, just like they are on the digital SAT",

    "postText": "I\u2019m registering for the August SAT and am looking for a test center, but there are no schools in my city open.. at all. I\u2019ve taken previous SAT\u2019s at my current high school and other high schools near me, but for some reason nothing shows up anymore. For context, I live in NYC. Could this be because school doesn\u2019t start yet in NYC? Do I have to commute hours just to take the SAT? Any advice is helpful!",

Heard it's because there's tons of demand for august, with a decreased amount of test centers because schools aren't going. \n\nI would sign up for one but also check every single day to see anything closer opens up.",

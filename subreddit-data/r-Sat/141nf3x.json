    "postText": "Been thinking about it all day and night since the test. Just wondering if there is any new news on the curve, especially the math section. Need to get at least 1350 (110 point increase from 1240) to have a chance at convincing my parents to let me take it one last time. Only studied for like 2 weeks but I got a 1320 on my practice test and it had a harder reading, writing, and no calc section (no test will ever be harder than calc june sat) than the one I took on Saturday so there is a chance.",

            "comment": "Tbh the curve, despite how hard people find the test, is never really that lenient unfortunately, otherwise many people would be scoring well. For example, many people along with myself  thought May was the hardest, then I saw I missed 7 math and got a 740, which a pretty standard curve. Probably gonna be the same so -1 wrong on math will be a 800 then every question missed will be 10 points off. Now in June many people thought it was hard, however I thought it was standard and went well compared to May so I doubt curve will be crazy. Just be honest with every question you may have missed and hopefully you can retake.",

I thought I literally bombed that writing section also when I took it but turned out I did fine. I felt the Same way  for June tho but hopefully I pulled through. Why can you only retake if you scored a 1350 or higher if you don\u2019t mind me asking?",

If I can increase my score that much in 2 weeks my parents said I could retake because my studying showed a large improvement. My main argument I guess would be if I improved this much in 2 weeks during the school year, imagine what I could do in ~9 weeks when I have no school. What do u think my score would be if I got a -10R, -5/-7W, -10M on June?",

We can say 700 math the worst case scenario assuming you actually missed 10, and anywhere from 640-690 in reading and writing assuming you missed that many you said. Either way you are looking fine to land in that range. However don\u2019t be discouraged if you get a 1290-1330 or just something not 1350 cause SAT takes lots of practice, time, effort and just all of that. May was my third attempt and hopefully this June will be my last that I actually really NEED to take it.",

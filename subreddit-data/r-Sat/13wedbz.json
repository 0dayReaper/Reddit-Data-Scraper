Also make a mind map of where each major topics/ideas in the passage are, so that you can connect a question to where the answer will most likely be in the passage. And for every single question, you should be able to support it with something from the passage. If you cannot prove your answer with some sort of evidence from the text, then that answer choice is probably not correct.",

I started prep for May SAT on 12 may itself cuz i had ap exam till 9 may and my school exam till 12 may. I just revised December notes for the week and gave test#4 on 19 may. Over the next 7 days i completed khan academy English cuz i was lacking in English. Got 1430 in #2. I did Khan academy math over the past 2-3 days and gave the test today (29 may) and got 1540.",

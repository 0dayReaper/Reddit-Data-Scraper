    "postText": "Can anyone give me some insight on how past SATs compare to the ones administered this year? I did the May 2019 test and got a really good score in reading, but I did pretty bad in math. However, when I did the March 2023 math, I got a perfect score in math and a low score in reading. Has cb made any concept sections easier or harder within the last 4 years, or is that just me being inconsistent? also any advice for test day would be much appreciated",

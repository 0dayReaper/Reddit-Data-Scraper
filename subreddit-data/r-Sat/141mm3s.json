Diminishing its importance is a mechanism people use to cope but it doesn\u2019t help in the long run; however, the best thing you can do is relax and wait for the results. If they aren\u2019t good, just work harder.\n\nI went from 1440 to 1440 from my sophomore to junior year. It took disappointment for me to get my score.",

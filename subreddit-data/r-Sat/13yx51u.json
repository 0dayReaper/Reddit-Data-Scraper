            "comment": "I was in a similar situation to you. I got around a 600 in my first attempt in the summer of 8th grade, and went up to a 750 by junior year.\n\nFor reading, you have to understand that all the answers are in the text. I can\u2019t stress this enough - there is basically no inferring - it\u2019s all written down somewhere almost word for word. If you read the answers, there will always be at least one small thing wrong. Either the incorrect answer will have a small detail that is unfounded, or it will be too strongly worded, or it will simply not answer the question. The best way tI really get a breakthrough on your English score is to understand how to spot the wrong answers and then complete some practice in reverse, until you can confidently answer the questions in a decent time frame.\n\nIf you have some specific questions or if you\u2019d like notes or examples, feel free to pm me and I\u2019ll try my best to help.",

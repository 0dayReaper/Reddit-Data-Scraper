            "comment": "The quickest way would be to realize that if the ratio of AB to BC is 4 to 1, then the ratio of AB to AC is 4 to 5. This means the ratio of the diameters, and thus the radii, of the two circles is also 4:5. This in turn means the ratio of their areas is 16:25. So if the area of the small circle is 72, the area of the big circle is 112.5 through proportions and their difference is 40.5. Or that the area of the big circle minus the small circle would be 9/16 the area of the smaller one = 40.5.\n\nA slower way would be to solve specifically for the radius of the small circle then use that to figure out the radius of the big circle, then use that to figure out the area of the big circle, then finally find the difference of the areas.",

    "postText": "I'm applying to the U.S colleges this fall, so I need to get a better score by at least November for EA. dream score is obviously 1500+. i still don't know if i will be able to take SAT this August, as I might be out of the country. and I also don't really know if I will be taking paper or digital... (HS exchange student) i also don't know if i will be taking a gap year (it depends on the application cycle results)\n\ni do Khan Academy 1h every day except the weekends + 1 practice on Friday. but it still doesn't seem to help a lot. I wanted to cram English part with Erica's books later. I also finished both Panda books....but idk honestly. i don't feel like my skills are improving. i even had a tutor and i understood the material on the lesson, but after a few weeks i forget completely how to solve it. (ik all the formulas but still)\n\ndo you guys have any tips for schedule/practicing? what should i do? or should i just give up and focus on other parts of my application? (i have pretty strong ECs and honors tho) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\ntoday i took paper practice \u211610 and got 1190\u2620\ufe0f (610M; 580R&amp;W). 43/58 right answers on MATH &amp; 70/96 on R&amp;W\n\nschools i want to apply for are:\n\n\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2640\ufe0f reach:\n\u2022 Yale \n\n\ud83c\udfaf target:\n\u2022 Skidmore\n\u2022 Syracuse\n\u2022 University of Rochester\n\u2022 Union\n\u2022 Brandeis\n\u2022 Rhodes\n\n\u2601\ufe0f safety:\n\u2022 southern mississippi\n\u2022 michigan state",

Once you go to the dashboard or the practice questions section (I can\u2019t remember which lol), you can take a practice test on the website, and it\u2019ll score the test for you and identify your weaknesses. Then, you can continue using the dashboard to curate your study plan. Lmk if you need more help :)",

I rose my score considerably through just doing Erica Meltzer (R &amp; W), the Panda math book, and the Black Book. Once I finished that, I just did previous QAS's. Try to adopt a study schedule so that every day you're working on something. Take breaks if necessary, just hammer out some study consistently. Practice makes perfect after all. Good luck!",

Your target schools seem very realistic and a lot of them I wouldn't be worried about getting in, so again do your research with those more than anything. \n\nWith Reading and Writing though\u2014your best improvements can come from taking your time and reading through it all, as well as studying using SAT word-prep books and learning latin prefix-suffix stuff. \n\nWith Math, think of it more as a game rather than actual math. I got a 1380 because I actually did the math, despite literally being in college level Calculus at the time lol, so do make sure to also look for how to game the sat math rather than just study its contents.",

You can use the Khan material or other sources to study the topic, periodically taking additional tests to judge progress. At some point you also need to practice taking the official digital practice tests, as that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be taking.\n\nFwiw, I\u2019m quite confident a British school teaches the Algebra, Geometry, and other math topics on the SAT. Most of the R &amp; W sections as well.",

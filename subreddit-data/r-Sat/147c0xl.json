Sorry this was like no help but I just remember that it equals a negative number and the number outside the absolute value was also negative so that there would be a solution.  I think the answer was also like -1 and -7 (one of them may have been positive)",

                    "comment": "My thing is that I believe that the =# was actually a positive at first. Like -2|x+#|=8 or some other number. Because there was a no solution answer choice. If it was indeed positive from the beginning and we divide it by a -2 that would make it a -4. (If I got the numbers right) therefore it would be no solution? I know it\u2019s very vague and probably all mixed together but I\u2019m freaking out about it rn lol cuz I can\u2019t remember what it really was",

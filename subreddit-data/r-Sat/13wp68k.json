What really worked for me was writing down all the math questions I had missed previously on flash cards with explanations and answers on the back of them. Make an effort to try and understand WHY you got the question wrong- whether it was a careless mistake or a concept you didn\u2019t know- and use that knowledge to get a question like that right the next time you see it. Also be sure that you know all the basic SAT math topics that might show up on test day (looking through Khan Academy and taking practice tests will help). You have quite a bit of time, so I 100% believe that you have the ability to do it!!! Keep going!!!",

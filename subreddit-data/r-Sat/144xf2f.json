    "postText": "I took the Sat about a year ago in august and got a 1560 (800 M 760 RW). That\u2019s a great score for me and Im definitely proud of how my effort has paid off. After I took it I kinda slacked off a little because the Sat was my biggest hurdle that I\u2019d finally overcome, and now I don\u2019t really have other major \u201cgoals.\u201d \n\nTime to time I visit this sub and try to answer some math questions, and surprisingly I just can\u2019t figure out how to do them despite the fact that I\u2019ve been able to do them before. It\u2019s also because I\u2019m not taking any math class in school right now so my math skills have been declining rapidly. \n\nIs this feeling of forgetting a lot of content normal or not?",

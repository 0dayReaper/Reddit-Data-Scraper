So not only do you have to analyze the text, but you sort of have to translate it into the type of English you're familiar with. For this, classic books and historical documents helped me. For example, before I took the SAT in March, I had finished reading Frankenstein (published back in 1818). Reading through this (while analyzing and looking up things I didn't know) really helped. For the historical passage, I got lots of practice reading historical documents in my US History class, but also from just doing lots of practice problems. For science, it's hard. I mess up on that too. You just have to be very careful about reading charts and graphs.",

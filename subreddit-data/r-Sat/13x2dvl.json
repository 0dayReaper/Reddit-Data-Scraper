So if the question was sqrt(4) = x. Find x. x would equal only 2.\n\nIf you take the square root during calculations (x\\^2 = 4; x = sqrt4) then the answer would be both +2 and -2.",

But the \u221a  symbol only refers to one of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Each positive real number has two square roots, one positive and the other negative. The square root symbol refers to the principal square root, which is the positive one.\n\nCB likes to regularly test this.",

Or earlier through a Talent Search. My daughter took it twice by 8th grade. But unless CTY, SET, DYS, etc. are of interest , there\u2019s no need to test early.",

            "comment": "You can take it as early as freshman year but it\u2019s better to wait until the end of freshman year or during sophomore year to start taking the SAT. This is mainly because you need time to prepare and get familiar with the test.\n\nIf you want to start studying I would recommend taking a practice either from the College Board website or on Khan Academy (they both have the same tests) to see where you are at. Then continue doing Khan Academy and maybe consider getting the Princeton Review SAT prep book for strategies and practice. \n\nAlso watch videos on YouTube and read this [article](https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-to-get-a-perfect-sat-score-by-a-2400-sat-scorer) from PrepScholar to help you get a high score.",

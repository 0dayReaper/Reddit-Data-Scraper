    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have decided as a way of being productive during summer break after completing my O level exams, to give the SAT in August before my A levels start in September. Since I'm an international student, I'll be giving the digital version. for those of you who have given the digital version, what is it like? more specifically, did you run into any errors or technical difficulties? were there any technical difficulties? we're there any specific restrictions on the kind of programs that could installed on your device? was there am outlet avaliable to plug your device into? what about rough working specifically for math?\n\nI took a full length test on bluebook and I got a 1220 out of 1600. would it be viable to increase the score through self studying, to at least a 1400 in the remaining time and if so what aspects should be given more importance, course revision or paper attempting technique?\n\nI appreciate if anyone reads through this and gives any answers to my questions",

But now I\u2019m around the 1300-1350 range. \n\nAll I did was study HARDER and not smarter. All I would do is do practice problems then with timing and expect to LEARN. \n\nNo no no, study 2-3hrs a day with 1 rest day and CREATE AN EFFICIENT STUDY PLAN (this is so important). Make sure you fucking have every incorrect answer ingrained in your brain and you FIX IT (mainly for math).  \n\nTrust me, with self-motivation with consistency, you\u2019ll reach a 1400+ with no question\ud83e\udef5",

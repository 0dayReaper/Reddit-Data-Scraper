If the tests are more difficult than normal, the score for a given number of mistakes could be a bit higher. That\u2019s the point of the equating process.\n\nIf you look at data at [https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/](https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/) you can see the same -5 in Math resulted in scores from 710 to 780, based on the difficulty of the test.\n\nHow students actually did on the test today has no impact on scoring.",

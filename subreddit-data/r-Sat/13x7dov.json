So it's definitely possible to get a good score with little prep, you'll just have to see I guess.",

Just make sure you maintain focus and don\u2019t get test fatigued during the later parts.\n\nIf your timing was not good, it might be good to take some full sections tests yet to get a better sense of how to pace yourself.",

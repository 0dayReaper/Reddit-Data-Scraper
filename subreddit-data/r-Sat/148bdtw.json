I'm also taking the August one but i'm not sure how else to practice since i've finished all 4 tests. Khan academy i feel never give the hard level 5 questions which i really need to practice. Is there any other ways to practice for dSAT or any other source for official dSAT questions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

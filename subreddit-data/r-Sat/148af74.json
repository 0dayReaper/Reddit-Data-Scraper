However, I think that once you get to a certain level of math you realize that simply being ahead or knowing content isn\u2019t enough to be \u201cgood at math\u201d. The innate problem solving skills dictates skill in math. Even though I am taking Linear Algebra Junior year after taking AP calc BC sophomore year, I still believe that there are plenty of people who are on a technically lower level of math but are still better because of those problem solving skills. I think the best test of someone\u2019s ability at math is to take content that everyone has learned already, and make it about the problem solving. This is essentially what Mathcounts, AMC, AIME, etc are. Mathcounts only requires middle school level math but I bet you that most high schoolers can\u2019t get more than 80% of the questions right.",

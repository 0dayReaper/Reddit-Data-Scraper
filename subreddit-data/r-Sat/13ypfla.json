So it stands to reason that if collisional erosion was enough to be the whole story, there would less of them than there are. (B)",

After looking at it again, it makes sense now, but the wording with \u201ccurrently\u201d initially made me think of sequential timeline sort of thing when it rather means \u201cactually\u201d (like they would find far fewer primitive astroids than it actually has). But maybe that was just me, and I wasn\u2019t thinking properly. I hate asteroids.",

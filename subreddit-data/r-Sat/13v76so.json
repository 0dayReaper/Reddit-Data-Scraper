    "postText": "So I first took the SAT back in April, and while I felt very confident I received a 1000. The day I got my score was the last day to purchase a retake for June 3rd so I did. I've been studying every day (with maybe 3-4 days ever where I didn't) and I have seen a major improvement, but not where my target goal is.  \nI Have taken the following tests (I will pair them with my score):  \n**Real Paper SAT April 12rd: 1000** (Math - 530) (R&amp;W - 470)  \n**Digital Practice Test 10 May 7th: 1130** (Math - 550) (R&amp;W - 580)  \n**Digital Practice Test 9 May 14th: 1160** (Math - 590) (R&amp;W - 570)  \n**Digital Practice Test 8 May 26th: 1140** (Math - 560) (R&amp;W - 580)  \n**Digital Practice Test 7 May 27th: 1220** (Math - 610) (R&amp;W - 610)  \n**Paper Practice Test 3 May 28th: 1180** (Math - 610) (R&amp;W - 570)  \n**Paper Practice Test 1 May 29th: 1230** (Math - 640) (R&amp;W - 590)  \n\n\nReading passages and writing nearly always the same amount of right answers.  \nFor math, It's usually the \"No Calculator\" sections  \n\n\nIf you would like any additional info like subscores, showing work, or notes in the test, please let me know, I am really trying to shoot for a 1300 to pair with my 3.83 GPA.",

            "comment": "Based on ur scores, I feel as if the best way to improve ur score is by learning math and writing concepts that appear on the SAT instead of doing practice tests every day. There isn't much time left before June 3rd but try and learn the grammar rules and math concepts that appear in SAT.",

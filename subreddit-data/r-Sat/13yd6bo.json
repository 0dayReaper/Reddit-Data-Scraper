My daughter first took it at 11 for CTY/SET/DYS.\n\nUnless you are entering a talent search, you will learn and improve over time, so it rarely make sense to test before Fall of Junior year.\n\nAfter 5 years, CB adds a note that a score may not be a valid indicator of current ability, but the scores are still \u201cvalid\u201d.",

My biggest concern is that by the time I\u2019m applying to college the SAT will be valued much less then the ACT and even a 1550+ will be worse then a 34. What do you guys think?",

And we know that the sides of two similar right triangles are equal hence AB/DE= EF/CB=AC/DF= 2.2/1. Hence sin D of angle DEF Will be 20/2.2 which is 9 and 29/2.2 which is 13.1 hence sin D 9/13.",

Something like:\n\nA) (3/5, r+3/5)\n\nB) (14, r-x\\^2/6)\n\nC) (r-3/5, r+3/5)\n\netc.\n\nI unfortunately don't remember exactly which answer I chose except that I chose answer choice C, where the two terms seemed to be identical except for one of the signs. Would anybody happen to remember whether they chose answer choice C? Thanks.",

Those who had this question will certainly remember it. Two angles were given as well as a comparison between two other angles like z&lt;y, and the question asked for us to compare two other different angles.\n\nThe answer choices were something like\n\nA) w&lt;z\n\nB) w=z\n\nC) w&gt;z\n\nD) w=2z\n\nI personally didn't have time to find all the angles I could and pick an answer choice accordingly but I do remember that since we were given that one angle was bigger than the other I somehow derived that indeed one angle was always going to be bigger than the other. So I picked either A or C in the choices I've put above. An intelligent friend of mine said he had put w=z instead, after doing the angle calculations, but I'm not sure whether that's right. Does anybody remember what they put and whether they calculated the angles and found something like B or rather an answer choice where one of the angles was greater than the others? Thanks.",

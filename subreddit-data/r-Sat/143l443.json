One of my friends who got in Cornell has zero hooks and seemed to have the normal \u201cIvy amount\u201d of AP\u2019s and EC\u2019s and she still submitted her 1420 or 1430, and still got in. But yes, \u201cregular\u201d applicants or wtv you want to call it, SHOULD preferably AIM FOR 1500+ to give them a better stepping stool but even if they get a 1400+ they should ALWAYS still submit rather than go test optional.",

Luckily my school has 2 college counselors and one of them was a former Duke AO and another was a UPenn AO. I\u2019m close to the Duke AO and she always told me how she is still in contact with the current AO\u2019s DAILY and she always always always has stated \u201calways submit a 1400+ for test optional schools because it looks better than having AO guessing on why you didn\u2019t take a test\u201d or something like that. Plus, 1400+ WILL NEVER HURT YOU and if it doesn\u2019t then why not go ahead submit? But two different POV we have which is completely fine but I truly believe a 1400+ will never never never hurt",

For competitive schools where even the 25th percentile may be close to a 1500, submitting a 1400 shows a lack of judgement and can actually hurt your application. As for the current post, UIUC admits by major, so if you're applying for a competitive major like CS or Engineering, a 1400 would be looked at negatively by the admissions officers.",

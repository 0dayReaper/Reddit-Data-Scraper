Helpful, I know. \n\nJust kidding, I studied after that first try to increase my score and just learnt grammar rules to try and move from answering questions intuitively to answering questions with an explanation.  The benefit of which is it decreases the probability you get a question wrong, no matter how low that probability is based on the strength of your intuition as a native speaker. \n\nThe penultimate strategy for scoring perfectly on writing (in my opinion) is to practice to such a large extent you can finish with time to spare \u2014 then move to the following strategy: before reading the multichoice options, have your perfect answer in mind, identify which is closest to your perfect answer, then rule out all the other incorrect answers with a reason in mind (I.e. \u2018that generates a comma splice error, that\u2019s an appositive clause without punctuation, etc\u201d). You won\u2019t finish with time to spare anymore, but that\u2019s irrelevant if you got everything right the first time through. I tend to think that checking is less time efficient than not making mistakes in the first instance. \n\nAlso, only read the whole writing passage where you can clearly see questions that would require you to do so e.f what\u2019s the best summary of this para, rearranging sentences or paragraphs. Otherwise just skim \n\nI think the best practice is just doing practice tests, there are hundreds available. Just do a couple everyday, score them, graph your scores on excel, so you can see directly the incremental improvement\u2014 which is excellent intrinsic motivation, at least for me.",

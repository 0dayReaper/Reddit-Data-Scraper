    "postText": "Hi there. To start with, I'm an A-levels student (which is the high school programme of the Cambridge University here in the UK).\n\nMy aim is to grab a fulbright ride to complete my undergrad in the USA. With that being said, I've decided to take up the SAT. But before evening getting my prep \"started\" I thought of just taking a full-fledged SAT test on the BLUEBOOK to evaluate how much work I gotta put in to &amp; which section needs the MOST improvement. \n\nTurns out, I literally ended up screwing the English section \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Scored 320 on English part. Never in my worse nightmares I thought I'd struggle with the language I can't live without. Lol. Reality check &amp; time to move on.\n\nNeed expert opinions on how to \"prepare\" for exam, especially for the ENGLISH section (tell me about the books, resources or strategies, etc or whatever YOU DID which helped YOU score around 1500s. Peace &amp; cheers.",

            "comment": "Though I\u2019m not a very high scorer myself, I can give a couple suggestions:\n1) How much time do you have left to prep? What score are you realistically aiming for? (Prep accordingly to those goals).\n2)Identify your weaknesses (might be grammar, punctuations, vocab, the formatting of the test, timing,..). You can use previous paper based SATs to determine your weaknesses so as not to exhaust the dSAT materials.\n3) If you have a decent vocab bank (which you probably do), it\u2019s better to just do lots of practice tests instead of mindlessly reading boring books. I\u2019m not a native English user myself and I felt significant improvement from this. \n4) Try to get grammar part as perfect as possible as it\u2019s the easiest part to improve in.\n\n\nResources for English section: \n+Erica Meltzer\u2019s books (Grammar and Reading) are great and comprehensive. (Haven\u2019t used them myself but heard great things)\n+Do Khan Academy\n+Consider studying vocab ( Vocab test level E-G worked great for me)",

I\u2019m confident that I can finish the grammar ones quick and leave  ~20 minutes for those last passages. I recommend experimenting with different approaches to see which one works best and studying the grammar perfectly so you can save time. Btw, trust the process - practice and practice.

I took the official exam 6 times (testing anxiety played a part in not scoring my goal and my parents were never satisfied). Honestly, the sat is not about being smart it\u2019s about knowing the exam itself. Do as many practice questions that you can and take all the practice exams you can. Figure out why you got those questions wrong and learn what answers they want. Literally get yourself in the mind of those that make the exam. The math portion is not bad as long as you have a solid foundation, bht if not practice practice practice and reading section is all strategy.",

            "comment": "A lot of these replies are from the paper sat takers so there's not a lot of overlap with the current digital SAT (saying this as someone who took the last international paper sat in dec 3, and as someone who took the june 3 digital sat)\n\nHere's my tips that had me scoring constant 1400+ in my bluebook practice tests:\n\n- CHECK WHERE YOUR ERRORS ARE AT!!! This is single-handedly the most important step. In grammar where do you make the most errors? Punctuation? Transition words? What about in math? Linear functions? Trigonometry? Write all of your \"problem\" subjects on a list and focus on them.\n\n- Khan Academy is your best friend, and not just in the traditional sense. I mean sure, it does have an SAT prep section, but it's mostly surface level. IIRC you can find all the math topics (and more that's not included in the SAT) under the Algebra (All Content) section. Same goes for grammar. There's a lot of detailed videos that make it easy to understand and practice tests for each topic.\n\n- Get a little notebook for notes! You can't trust yourself to remember every grammar rule, every formula. Read it once or twice daily and it's a great way for the information to stick :)\n\n- For reading, most of the sources are for paper SAT which is vastly different than the digital SAT. Khan Academy's digital SAT reading section guide provides helpful tips, but other than that there's a few practice questions on bluebook that can help you get used to them. (After a while you just instinctively start to understand the reading questions)\n\n- If you run out of resources, just take a pencil SAT to see where you're at. Math and Grammar aren't that different, and the part you'll struggle at most would just be the Reading section.\n\n- Don't use your bluebook practice tests liberally. Currently there's only four practice tests, so use them as milestones. Space them out equally. I started taking my bluebook practice tests a month before my SAT so I took them once a week. If I needed a challenge, I took paper SATs in the middle of the week.\n\nGood luck! If you have any more questions, be sure to ask!",

                    "comment": "Also for strategies for the reading section! there's about 5-ish questions in the middle part of the reading section which are reading heavy. Leave them for last. Do all the questions before them, then skip to when the grammar questions start (around Q17) and do all of them.\n\nFor the bulletpoint questions, you don't have to read the passage itself. Just understand what the question wants and select the answer that gives exactly what it's asking for. It could save you up to five minutes where you'd be skimming the passage for information that you don't need to learn. The only times I'd read the passage was if there was very specific information that I didn't know much about (for example, there was a question where it was asking for the translation of a word, so i skimmed the passage to find the translation and picked the answer which had said translation)\n\nIf a question is taking you too long to answer, mark it for review, then come back to it if you have time. You don't need to answer a few question correctly, you need to answer all of them no matter what.",

Khan Academy has a great video on transitions so I'd recommend checking that out. I used Erica's Math and Grammar books for my first SAT and they were great foundations. You'll quickly learn that the SAT doesn't really test you on knowledge... it just tests you on knowing the test. The more you practice the easier it'll be and in the end taking the real test won't feel any different than taking a Bluebook test at home (at least that was how it was for me).",

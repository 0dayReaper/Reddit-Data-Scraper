    "postText": "We are dreamers, we are believers. We put our everything into this, it  is simply not right for someone to say you can achieve only what they  think you can achieve. They don't fucking know you, they don't know the  time, blood, sweat, and tears you put into this; they are stupid with  how quick they are to put someone who is as much of a fucking beast as  you in a box. I believe in you, and if you don't get your dream score  now, I believe in you to get your dream SAT score in the next SAT you  take, I know you will be back on the grind if you don't get the score  you want, because you are a dreamer, and you are a believer, and you  will prove them wrong.",

Rage against people who doubt is like coal, it is useful as a temporary power source, but unsustainable; having support is like nuclear power, much more sustainable, much more powerful, and much more long lasting. People just need to be more supportive and kind instead of judgy and bitchy for a better, and happier society.",

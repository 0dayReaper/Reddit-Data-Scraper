If you\u2019re struggling with your grade level math, then I\u2019d suggest going down a grade or two in the math sections and work your way up from there. Khan academy should explain how to solve a question after you answer, so if you reviewing the questions doesn\u2019t help, there\u2019s not much I can say outside of \u201cgit gud.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged by going over old topics, it\u2019s the only way to stop not knowing.",

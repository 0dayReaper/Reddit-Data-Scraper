Take down the name of your proctor and your room number and if you can remember, testing center code. I wrote an email to Collegeboard about it before results came out explaining the situation and giving all the information I said to remember above. They answered me with \"lol we dont think it affected your test score but we can refund you if you want\" and will give you the choice of a refund or choosing to stay with your score (they dont tell you your score tho). I'm not sure what will happen if they do \"dEtErmIne\" it affected the test score but thats what happened with me.",

They genuinely gdaf (here's part of the email they sent after I reported my incident \"...however, because you did not have a standardized testing experience, you have the option of either canceling your score and receiving a full refund of test fee(s)  or reporting your current score. You cannot view your score to determine which option you prefer. If you decide to retake the SAT, note that it may not be available on all dates, and test center capacity may be limited...\").",

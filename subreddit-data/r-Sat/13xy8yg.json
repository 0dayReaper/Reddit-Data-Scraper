Watching Scalar Learning's YouTube videos covering \"Everything you need to know for an 800 in Math\" was really helpful, is there anything like that for writing? Thanks!",

That being said, this can be done with any youtube video or even an SAT prep book or worksheet or simple google search. I don\u2019t know my SAT writing score but I got a 34 on ACT writing with a princeton review book",

This is rarely a good idea.\n\nMonths later,, this is not available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Each time you register to take the SAT on a weekend, you can send four score reports for free. You can designate your score recipients at the time you register or any time until you take the test. You also have until nine days after the test to use your free score reports.

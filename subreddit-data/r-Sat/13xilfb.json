Now you want 4a-4, so you have to solve for a.\n\nYou're given that x\\^2 gets canceled out (since the answer only has x). If this is confusing, rewrite the equivalent expression bx as 0x\\^2 + bx + 0. \n\nSo, 4ax\\^2 (by FOIL) - x\\^2 (given) = 0\n\n(4a - 1)\\*x\\^2 = 0. \n\n4a = 1. \n\na = 1/4.\n\nNow what's 4a-4?",

A problem with SAT Reading is that students are not exposed much to the type of readings you see on the test, and practicing the test only gives you 700 or so words from each reading, which isn\u2019t much exposure. So 15 mins of additional exposure is almost an entire Reading test\u2019s worth of material.\n\nPick readings from the archive that interest you, and you\u2019ll get better at retention, detail recognition, mistake catching, tone match, etc.",

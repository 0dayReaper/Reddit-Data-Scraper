The SAT is very different from reading for pleasure or school book reading because it is purely evidenced based. If you\u2019re able to understand the structure of the test itself and get used to a strategy that is reliable and works for you then the Sat reading section is easy. The Sat as a whole is really an exam that tests your test taking skills and adaptability rather than intelligence.",

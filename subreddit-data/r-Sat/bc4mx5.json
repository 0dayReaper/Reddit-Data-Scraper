I just accidentally dropped a desk on it a few years ago and never got a new one.\n\nOddly enough the only math class that I can remember using it for in undergrad was a senior year analysis class though.  I tried to use it on my first test in calculus I.  I came in a few minutes late, got the test, sat down in the back row of a 200 person class and put it on the table.  The teacher immediately looked at me and beelined his way up 20 stairs to tell me that if I didn't put it away I was going to get a 0 in the course.  I had apparently not been paying attention in class and had no idea it wasn't allowed. I'm not sure how common that is at other schools, but I didn't really need it outside of physics.",

Especially when a graphing calculator is not allowed as it was for much of the early portion of my Calc BC class. It has been around 10 years since i used it, but one thing i remember is you can type in algebraic equations and it would solve for the variable. I highly recommend this calculator.",

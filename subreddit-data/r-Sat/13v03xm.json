            "comment": "1. read slower. this probably wont help much so i'll suggest the following way to answer questions:\n\ndont even read the passage if you can't comprehend it. you're just wasting time.\n\ngo straight to the questions with a quote and answer them. these should be relatively easy because you know exactly which lines to go.\n\nanswer the lines with the vocab words \"the word in line x most nearly means\"\n\nthen, answer everything else that doesn't require you to read random lines. for example something like \"what is the main purpose of paragraph 6\" or \"the phrase x serves mainly to\" \n\nthen come back to the main idea/main purpose and rest of the general literal comprehension questions without line references. since you've done all the quote ones already, you should have a somewhat decent understanding of the passage from answering the questions. try to apply chronological order rule which means earlier questions are likely to appear earlier in the text and all questions are in a somewhat chronological order. note that this doesn't always apply.",

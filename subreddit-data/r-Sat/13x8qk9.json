    "postText": "so i took the digital may 2023 SAT on may 6th and expect the score to be released by may 19th. however, College Board sent me an email (1st photo) to inform me that my score is being delayed for 3 weeks. I freaked out bc i was so clueless about the reason why this happened with me, I didn\u2019t do any suspicious thing in my test day.\n\nthis morning they sent me an email (2nd photo) inform that some score are released, some are cancelled and some have to wait for another 6 weeks. my friend\u2019s score was released 2 hrs ago but mine is still pending, does that mean i have to wait until mid july \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

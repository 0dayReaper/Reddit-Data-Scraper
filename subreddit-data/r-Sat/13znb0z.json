            "comment": "My personal take: the recent sat no calc sections have been increasingly difficult, but the curves have been forgiving. If it becomes \u201ceasier\u201d it\u2019s either as a result of practice, or easy questions leading to a less forgiving curve. \n\nI think the main issue with no calc is not necessarily the content, but having to answer the questions in a small time frame( harder if you don\u2019t know shortcuts)",

If you only knew how to answer 5, I believe allocating time to learn the fundamentals and then doing practice tests would help",

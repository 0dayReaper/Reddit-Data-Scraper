I got a 1420 in May and never got above a 1440 in the practice tests (I wasn\u2019t checking my work or anything or taking it super seriously though since it wasn\u2019t the actual test). But they definitely helped me get comfortable with the questions and how they work. The khan academy feedback is *incredible*. I\u2019m usually not great at the reading either but for some reason I found this SAT\u2019s reading to be easy. But for the reading just practice using khan academy and pay attention to the feedback. \n\nI\u2019m going into something with math and I got 800 on that. I was more surprised at my R/W score than the math tbh. But the overall score was a shock to me. I spent my next class period completely zoned out",

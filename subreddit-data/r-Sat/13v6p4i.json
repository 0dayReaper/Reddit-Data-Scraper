            "comment": "I'm not sure how true this is, but I did a little research on this test and I found that some answer keys are showing that the answer is D while others show that the answer is C. I found a video of a tutor going over this passage, and he marked C as his answer, so I would probably just go with that as D makes no sense at all. Either way, the first paragraph isn't necessarily an analysis as choice B represents, but more of a perceptual description. the narrator isn't analyzing anything about the Yaak, but describing it. Similarly, the second paragraph seems to be describing the certain time frame, the summer, that the story will take place. The authors seems to have seperated the description of the spring, winter, and fall from the summer to emphasize that the summer, which is also differentiated with the introduction of a present tense, is the current season. Therefore, while one could argue that the first paragraph was indeed an analysis, the main purpose of the second paragraph is not to further analyze, but to introduce the setting. keyword being MAIN",

            "comment": "answer key is wrong. the correct answer is C.\n\nI also took the march 2023 test a week or two back ans missed the exact same question and also put B.\n\nthe reason why B is incorrect because it says an *analysis* introduced previously. you wouldn't really see an *analysis* in a fictional passage, only really in nonfictional texts. An example of an analysis would be something like examing the causes of something or why something happened, which is clearly not what the previous sentence was talking about, as it's only describing summer.\n\nC is correct because it expands upon summer. Why? It was describing all 4 seasons but only cared about explaining more about summer. That's because the rest of the story takes place in the summer (timeline) which matches C.",

I know they probably wouldn't, but it really costs a lot to travel to a different country to take a test. The test fee is pretty much the small part. \n\nI understand a lot of others who did get their score cancelled might have spent a lot of money as well or/and put in a lot of effort. All the best to you. \n\nEdit: improved the writing; didn't expect this much attention.",

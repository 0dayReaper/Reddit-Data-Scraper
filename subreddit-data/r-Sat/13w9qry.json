In a way, Sat is extremely important but it is only one part of the application. \"However\" needs to be part of the 2nd sentence since it acts as a tool of contradiction. If it's part of the third sentence, it doesn't make sense because saying that sat is only one part of the application and mentioning other parts of the application doesn't involve any contrast. Choice D is practically the same as \"Sat is extremely important. However, it is only one part of the application.\"",

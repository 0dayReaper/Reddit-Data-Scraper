Depends very much on where you\u201dre starting and how quickly you are traveling.\n\nTake at least a couple practice tests to see where you are scoring today and you can get some anecdotal data from students who started at the same point.\n\nKhan Academy is a very good free resource for preparation, along with practice tests issued by College Board. Additional digital test (I assume) prep material will be coming out this Summer.",

            "comment": "quality over quantity! Spending 6 hours a day without analyzing everything and really knowing what mistakes you are making is probably not going to help you. I\u2019d say that as long as you are practicing with quality, you can definitely get the score you want. Be genuine with the practice and let yourself make mistakes because you have the time to learn from them!\n\nKhan Academy for math is good! For reading or grammar try using khan academy, but i preferred using the Erica Meltzer books. Khan Academy is good practice either way, I just liked it more for math!\n\nAnd for practice tests, do the College Board practice tests or QAS from past tests! If you are taking DSAT I assume that there would be some practice tests available by then.\n\nBest of Luck!",

    "postText": "So I've been assigned a makeup test on 17th June for the 3rd June DSAT. I am an intl. student(for context). I wanted to know if there will be some similarity in the exam with the original 3rd june one. Like, I've seen many people rant that it was pretty hard and was wondering if will it be the same or not. Are questions repeated or not, if someone who appeared in a makeup test before could you please help, I'm really anxious.\n\nAlso, when can I expect the results to be out?",

Just like any other SAT.\n\nQuestions for all digital SATs are pulled from a large pool of questions, so there\u2019s a non-zero chance you will see a question that someone else saw two weeks ago, yes.\n\nI suggest focusing on taking the test rather than topics like this. And I would expect results around June 30, the same 13 day timeline, though makeup scores seem to have some variability.",

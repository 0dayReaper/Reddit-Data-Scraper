    "postText": "Hello all,\nI have paid for my last two SAT\u2019s with fee waivers since one day I saw that I had them available on my account. My sister is now telling me that it\u2019s weird that I had those few waivers since they are usually given to low income individuals and that is not really the case for me. Does anyone know why I might have gotten them? I didn\u2019t request one or anything like that, they just appeared.",

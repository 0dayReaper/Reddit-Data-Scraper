Don\u2019t frantically solve papers on the last day, focus more on conceptual understanding and you\u2019ll be good to go. Best of luck :)",

Also when you study on Khan Academy whenever you do the reading passages use a stop watch and see how long you take to complete a passage. \n\nThe math section I would recommend using Khan Academy and learn every single topic there is on there. If you need help there is plenty of resources on YouTube that go over how to answer questions from the SAT you don\u2019t need a tutor or pay for an online course. For the most part they are just scams as a lot of that information you could find on a YouTube video. From there take your first practice test. Take as many as you can before your SAT as this will teach you the timings of the reading. \n\nPractice tests are the key to doing good on the SAT imo try to recreate the environment as closely as you can as well. Take it at 8AM and if you can print out the packet. And also do not procrastinate and cram study the day before that is just a formula for disaster. Have belief in yourself, get a good nights rest, and be prepared. I\u2019m sure you can do it good luck!",

There\u2019s another take in August and I believe another in October as well. The test is scaled, then you also have the retake option if you still don\u2019t like your score. \n\nYou guys are smart enough to be spending your free time on an SAT subreddit. You deserve the good scores but also deserve to prioritize your mental health!!",

Fwiw, I am Indian applying for Poli Sci to T20s and a few T30s (Got safeties elsewhere) asking for close to full financial aid. All of the schools I am applying to are TO. Should I prioritize a 1500+ dSAT Score and sacrifice some extracurricular polishing or just go TO?",

            "comment": "I think definitely take the SAT. As per the CDS of many TO unis, standardised testing is still very important. You're pretty close to a 1500+ anyway. Just brush up on the EBRW section using a book like Erica Meltzer. A good SAT will def add to your application.",

Try working on the writing section because brushing up on grammar rules is easy and gets your score up. For the reading section, Erica Meltzer and reading SAT level passages worked for me.",

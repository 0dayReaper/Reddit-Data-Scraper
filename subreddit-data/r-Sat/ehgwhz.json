They just ousted me as a cheater and left me with no opportunity to retake as a senior. I understand that if these security questions are enough to let you in then it's easy for people to just trade information and cheat, but isn't that why you need a state issue id with your name and picture on it? I mean if you have to be the person that's in the picture, have to be able to provide information used for verification, and have an id that matches first core name and core last name, isn't that enough to verify your identity despite missing a last name? Otherwise what's the point of even needing the picture",

Now I\u2019m not gonna say anything, but we will never know if that person actually got away with their picture. Regardless, a picture is gonna have more leniency than a name because a person\u2019s looks usually won\u2019t differ too much and will most likely be completely different to the person sitting next to them. That\u2019s why the ID\u2019s have your name and why you give your full legal name. They do have your DOB on your record though, and that\u2019s that they can match DOB to your name to narrow down people. As for SSN, while it does seem Bette to do this truth be told SSN\u2019s repeat quite often in the last 4 digits and while it would make it much easier to identify people, ultimately they have to match the SSN to your name and DOB as an SSN alone serves no purpose (last 4 digits not entire SSN)",

They just don't print my full legal name on my id since it's too long, but cb never had a problem with this (not in the 6 ap tests, 2 sat subjects, psat, nor previous sat that I had taken prior) until my last chance. They did these to a huge amount of other Hispanics at the test center too.  I know they say you need to have the name on your admission ticket match your id, but the process needed to change it required me to show them documents where my name is printed elsewhere, like my birth certificate, and these have my full name printed so they wouldn't change it to match my id. It's ultimately just a flawed system design to expect Hispanics to be able to bring documentation with names printed exactly as their full legal name with the inconsistent way that American bureaucracy handles them.",

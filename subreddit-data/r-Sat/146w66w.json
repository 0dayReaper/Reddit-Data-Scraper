It\u2019s free, let\u2019s you do full practice tests from previous SAT administrations, and has practice for each of the sections. I would do a practice test to see how you stand, and then it will recommend practice modules based on how you did.",

                    "comment": "I have some SAT tips I came up with as well:\n\n1. Don\u2019t bubble each answer after you complete each question. Instead, wait until you finish a reading passage and its subsequent questions to bubble answers, or, for math sections, do two pages and then bubble your answers.\n2. Don\u2019t leave anything blank (I\u2019ve failed this step \ud83d\ude2d). If the time left is just a minute or two, bubble every multiple choice question with a guess and put something\u2014anything\u2014for the grid in ones.\n3. If you have an answer sheet and a test booklet, put the answer sheet under the test booklet and slide the booklet up enough to show only the section you are on (and those above since you can\u2019t cover them). This helps with bubbling and maximizes desk space.\n4. My favorite tip. I don\u2019t know if this applies to the act, but on the sat they make you put your closed answer sheet in the test booklet on the last page you were on. When the proctor has you start the new section, they will have you take out your answer sheet (leaving the test booklet closed) and then say you can start. This means you have to open the test booklet and find the section again. My tip is, when you take your answer sheet out, keep the edge of your thumb on the page your answer sheet was on. This way, you don\u2019t have the book open, but when time starts, you can go straight to the page you were on and flip a couple pages to the next section.",

                                    "comment": "There are basic rules that grammar follows\u2014that\u2019s why it is called grammar; it is a system of rules.\nIf you noticed, I already gave you a lesson with the above sentence.\n\nOne of the most important rules: if you start an offset clause\u2014I don\u2019t know the technical term\u2014with a specific punctuation (a comma or em dash), you have to the offset part the same way, unless it is the end of the entire sentence.\n\nI gave an example in the previous sentence, but here\u2019s a specific one:\nMany people said John was a simple\u2014but rather kind\u2014man.\n\nNotice how \u201cbut rather kind\u201d is offset. It can be removed from the sentence and the remainder will still be a complete sentence. So, I start the offset with an em dash (\u2014), which most people call a dash. Since I started by using an em dash, I must end with one.\n\n\u201cI thought you seperated that stuff with commas tho?\u201d\nCommas can also be used. Em dashes are simply a stronger method. Weakest is parentheses, then commas, then em dashes.\n\n\u201cOk. So if dashes are a choice choose them.\u201d\nNot always. But if part of a sentence is offset with a dash and then you have to complete the offset, use a dash.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example that is not correct:\nThe graveyard is spooky\u2014because of the ghost stories, and scares off robbers.\n\nIt will often have you replace the underline portion of an offset, but the underline won\u2019t include the starting offset. Therefore, you must close the offset with what it started with, and that will be the answer. Sometimes, it will be the whole thing, and then you have to make sure that whatever answer option you choose has the same type at the beginning and end.\nNow, the exception to this rule is the end of sentences. If there is an offset that ends a sentence, just use the normal punctuation mark at the end of the sentence (., ?, or !).\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\nJohn, according to his sons, was a kind man\u2014but he had a temper.\n\nSince the sentence ends, you don\u2019t have to put an em dash. You can just use a period.\n\nAnother thing I hope you know:\n\u201cDogs are cool.\u201d NOT \u201cDog\u2019s are cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do you use apostrophes?\u201d\nFor possession. \u201cMark\u2019s dog is cool.\u201d And also if you\u2019re quoting within a quote, but that\u2019s prolly not gonna be on the sat so don\u2019t worry about that.\n\nI know they put this (apostrophe tricks) on some of the answers.\nIt will be like \u201cchildrens toys are nice.\u201d\nIt should be \u201cchildren\u2019s toys are nice.\u201d\n\nOr it will be like \u201cresearcher\u2019s are working to\u2026\u201d\nWhich is wrong. It should be \u201cresearchers are working to\u2026\u201d\nIt might also say \u201cresearchers\u2019 are working to\u2026\u201d\nWhich, as you can guess, is also wrong.\n\n\u201cWait. Why did the first one have an apostrophe and the second one didn't?\u201d\nThe quoted parts are possible answer choices.\n\n\u201cWait. But why does children's have one and researchers doesn't?\u201d\nThe researchers don\u2019t own anything. They are working to do something. The toys are children\u2019s toys. They are toys owned/possessed by children.\n\nAnother thing is how to combine sentences.\nWhen combining sentences, try to avoid fracturing/splitting up the sentences. This is one that\u2019s hard to judge sometimes. There will be an underlined portion that\u2019s two sentences that they want you to combine. Since both are independent clauses, you will typically use a comma and one of the fanboys. It might also be a semicolon. Or in rare cases it will be a colon.\n\n\u201cSemicolons they're like periods but only if the 2 sentences are like about each other. Not a completely new thought.\u201d\nBasically. Like this: It was nice outside; the sun was out, and the birds chirped.\n\nBut my tip on these (because they want clarity and conciseness) is to read each option and see how it sounds. Sometimes they\u2019ll have answer choices that put parts of a sentence in the middle so it doesn\u2019t flow.\n\n\u201cThe ones that say where does this sentence go or which sentence needs to be taken away. I got those down I think.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a different problem. Those ones are annoying. Sometimes they are easy. Usually the flow will sound weird so you can determine which is right based on how it sounds.\n\nAn example for combining sentences:\nThe paintings were elaborate, well-designed masterpieces. The paintings often had very specific historical references that took a trained eye to see.\n\nThey\u2019ll ask you to combine them.\nAnd one bad choice will be like: \u201cThe paintings, often having very specific historical references, were elaborate, well-designed masterpieces that took a trained eye to see.\u201d\nThis one is bad because the ending, \u201cthat took a trained eye to see,\u201d applies to the paintings themselves. The original sentences did not say the paintings were hard to see.\nOr maybe another wrong one will be:\n\u201cTaking a trained eye to see, the paintings were elaborate, well-designed masterpieces that often had very specific historical references.\u201d\nSame thing here basically.\n\nSo, the best answer might be this:\n\u201cThe paintings were elaborate, well-designed masterpieces that often had very specific historical references that took a trained eye to see.\u201d\nBut this would be a good answer because it doesn\u2019t split up parts of the sentence. It also keeps it easy to read.\n\nOne more thing. Well, ig you kinda got it down, but it\u2019s to make sure you watch what modifiers (if that\u2019s the right word) are applying to.\nLike \u201cDelicate and soft, the flower was\u2026\u201d Delicate and soft applies to the flower. In the painting example, the original sentences applied the part about taking a trained eye to see to the details, not the painting\u2014but some of the choices applied it to the paintings themselves.\n\nAnd my very final tip is to not sound overly wordy. Don\u2019t put, if it\u2019s an option, \u201cthe most efficient way for the company to increase its fiscal gain compared to costs is to\u2026\u201d\nJust put \u201cthe most efficient way for the company to increase profit is to\u2026\u201d\nThere are some questions like this.",

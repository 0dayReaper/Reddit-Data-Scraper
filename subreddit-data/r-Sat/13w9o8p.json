    "postText": "Sat is this week and I\u2019ve run out of ideas on how to improve on the evrbw sections. I mean my score is good and all with a 640 last time I took it and little increase since then. But I am looking to improve it more because that\u2019s what\u2019s holding my grade down. More what I\u2019m Looking for are tips on how to better within this week. Any general super helpful tips you have found generally for this section or just advice on what to do. I think it\u2019s possible to get my math score to the 760 range but my evrbw just feels blocked at 640.",

Do you struggle more with Reading or Writing? \n\nFor reading, I always reference the passage for EVERY SINGLE QUESTION. Seriously, all the answers are right there so make sure you take your time reading and understanding. If you struggle with one specific type of passage though, I recommend doing the test completely out of order. Personally, I suck at historical and the double passages so I always do those first while my brain is fresh and not completely fried. It also helps me manage my time better. \n\nFor writing, make sure you read the entire passage as well. It\u2019s easy for your eyes to float straight to the next question but reading really helps you get context for the grammar and content of the passage. But, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW GRAMMAR RULES. This includes knowing when to use a dash, semicolon, commas, etc. Also know the difference between effect and affect. For this section, you also wanna really read in your head and see if your answers make sense. \n\nHope this helps!",

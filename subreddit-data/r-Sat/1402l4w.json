    "postText": "I\u2019ve gotten through most of Erica meltzer\u2019s grammar book, and her entire reading book. On my last SAT, I\u2019ve gotten a 680, with 11 wrong in reading and 6 wrong in writing. What other sources(other than khan) should I use to improve? I\u2019m aiming for a 1500, or preferably 1550, and my math is already at a consistent 780-790 range. Should I use uworld to grind on reading and writing? I\u2019ve tried 1600 io that seems to be helpful for reading and math but not so much for writing. Pls rec me some sources thank you!",

Erica meltzer should cover most of the writing section, so I suggest you look over it again",

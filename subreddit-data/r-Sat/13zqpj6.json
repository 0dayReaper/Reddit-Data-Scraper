    "postText": "I just took the digital SAT on May 2023. They didn't sent me my scores when everyone got theirs. I waited 2 more weeks and. After this time they sent me an email saying that I cheated on the exam and my score was cancelled. When i first saw it I couldn't realize it. I was shocked and freezed just stood there where I was looking to the phone. They cancelled my score without cheating, i don't know what kind of policy they have, but this is the most unfair thing I ever lived in my life. How can you do this to someone who is innocent? Who didn't do anything wrong? I swear to God, the only thing I did was going in to the test center, writing my test and then going out.",

The answer is 32, which makes sense when you plug it in, but I have no idea how to arrive at that answer in the first place.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9eqmja53i3b1.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc01c6149f9f3335fa4b999b0432e79771271773",

You can write equations relating the two for each situation.\n\nS / 2 = T + 4\n\nS / 4 = T - 4\n\nThis is a system of equations. Since we are solving for S, the quickest way to solve this would be eliminating T by subtracting the bottom equation from the top one. That would give us:\n\nS / 4 = 8\n\nS = 32",

That would lead you to  2T + 8 = 4T - 16, which would get you to T= 12 which would then get you to S =32.",

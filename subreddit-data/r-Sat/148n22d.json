    "postText": "I'm writing this Saturday (makeup test) and I already have a 1540 (770 EBRW 770 Math). I'm pretty sure I will get a 790 or 800 on math if I write bringing me up to a 1560-1570. I'm targeting HYPS since those are the only international schools my parents are willing to pay for. The only problem however is that its my friends birthday on Friday so I have to decide between going to that or writing on Saturday.\n\nEdit: I am over the age of 18 and the drinking age in my country is 18, so I won't be able to write Saturday morning.",

For the rest, since OP is looking at multiple T5 schools, having the extra 20-30 points on the Math section can make a difference - so they can choose between that and having driving with friends.",

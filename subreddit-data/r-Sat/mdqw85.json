You mean can raise your score pretty easily by just following some simple tips and tricks PrepScholar provides: https://blog.prepscholar.com/sat-tips-and-tricks-you-must-use. \n\nMost of my score improvement came from just doing things differently, like using process of elimination and not spending too much time on longer questions. \n\nFor Math the best you can do is practice, usually with enough practice it\u2019s not hard to aim for even an 800. (I raised my math to an 800 through pure practice). \n\nFor English and Writing time is of the essence, skipping long/ difficult questions and leaving them for later will usually let you finish most of the test and work on the 3-4 questions that are REALLY hard. The worst thing you can do is get stuck on those and then realize too late you don\u2019t have the time and then rush through the rest of the test, making careless errors. I\u2019ve never been too good at English but I was able to use this on my last test to limit myself to only 3-4 questions wrong in each section (730, I plan to try again with superscoring in mind).\n\nI raised my score from 1360 on my junior PSAT, to a 1530 less than 3 months later. You\u2019ve got plenty of time to make a similar transformation. Good luck!",

Hence you cannot out rank yourself, or others with a 1600.\nIt calculates % of people BELOW you, rather.\n\nI think CB should give us points back... as they can\u2019t explain their stats properly.",

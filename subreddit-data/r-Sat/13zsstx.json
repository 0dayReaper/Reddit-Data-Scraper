    "postText": "I took the day SAT in april and got a 1420 (720 r/ 700 m). That\u2019s decent improvement from my PSAT from october (1350; 720 r/ 630 m). My PSAT10 was 1270 (700 r/ 570 m).\n\nI dont want to go like the ivies or anything. Right now my list is: Loyola Chicago, UIUC, Illinois State, Marquette, and maybe UW Madison and Notre Dame. \n\nI feel like I could do better considering this was my first shot. I knew I messed up on the reading; I missed a lot more questions than I had on the PSAT (didnt time myself well), but I studied on Khan Academy for math, and I think that paid off. I\u2019m mainly just disappointed my reading score didnt improve.\n\nIs it worth it to retake? Will it really open up that many more opportunities?",

    "postText": "If you have a couple long car rides coming up, and you wanted to get started with SAT prep, how could you use that time most effectively? Phone, printed paper, or a book (that can be ordered quickly) are all options, but not working on a laptop in the car.\n\nThis is for an excellent student (in U.S), in all advanced or accelerated classes and T20 ambitions. Decent test taking skills, other than going too slowly, but very unfamiliar with SAT strategy and how to approach types of questions. Current sophomore, with a \u201chook\u201d that can lead to earlier evaluation of scores/grades, considering trying to wrap up standardized testing with traditional SAT by December, before it goes digital. \n\nIs there a book to start with in the car?Helpful apps or websites that work well on a phone?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "In this equation, V (volts) is being calculated by the equation of -2.6 + (d/3). \n\nFor instance, if d is 10, this is the equation: V = -2.6 + (10/3); V = roughly 0.733 after you do the math. The question is asking, how much do you have to change the variable d, in order to increase the volts produced by 1. \n\nYou can look at the equation and notice: V = -2.6 + (d/3). For each time you increase d by one, V increases by 1/3. This is because you are adding (1/3) each time you increase d by one. \n\nHow many times does it take to increase V by one, then? Divide 1 by (1/3), and you get 3. \n\nYou can then plug this answer back into the initial equation to double check that it's right. \n\nHope this helps",

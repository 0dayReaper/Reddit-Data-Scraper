    "postText": "I\u2019m pretty good at math in a classroom space since 95% of the time I will know what subject of math I need to focus on. But on the SAT everything I\u2019ve learned just goes out the window since I usually do not know what subject to start with. Any strats or good practice sites I could use? I already take practice tests on khan academy but always do pretty poorly in math",

Use your anger. Let it become your personal vendetta to never let it get one over on you again. Become so accustomed to it that you even know what it\u2019s trap answers are going to be.",

If it\u2019s a hyper specific topic like percent solutions you\u2019ll have to specify that topic in particular.\n\nSee how you\u2019re supposed to approach the question and try to find some practice questions to see how much you understand",

    "postText": "Hey guys, i\u2019m taking the sat tomorrow and i haven\u2019t been able to study much because of finals, and this is my second time taking it (I took it March 2022 and scored 770 math 650 english), and so I was wondering if there were any good tips and tricks to use especially on reading to get a last minute score increase, because I haven\u2019t been able to do much, apart from taking a practice SAT 3 weeks ago on khan academy (got a 800 math and 690 english). I\u2019m not TOO worried about this test since I am still a sophomore in hs and will have my junior year next year, but I also don\u2019t want to get too low of a score lol. I\u2019m also pretty new to standardized testing, so is there any good shortcuts I could use for tomorrow morning? Thanks and good luck on tomorrow\u2019s SAT!",

            "comment": "1) read the text super closely, don\u2019t skim don\u2019t try to do questions while reading. Get a thorough understanding of the text while underlining, and marking main ideas and transition words. Spend like 5 min\n2)now when u get to the questions ur gonna find them way easier AND your gonna know where evidcne and stuff are\n3) More on active reading: for literature, mark whenever a character is showing his attitude about another character, mark descriptions (write next to it: description of this character) and think about why the author describes certain stuff. This will make finding the evidence for your questions easy. For history, think about just the main argument of the author\n4) for paired evidence questions, work together with the evidence and the first question. Try to cross out a few answers and then see what the evidence is saying. \n5) Don\u2019t make a single assumption. You gotta be REASONABLE with the text, this isn\u2019t your english class where u can say that red color displays her anger. Most often, the answer will be literally paraphrased in the text. Even for inference quesitons, it\u2019s usually just a converse or straightforward statement.\n6) don\u2019t trust answers with \u201cevery, all, always, extreme ..\u201d and trust choices with \u201cmay, perhaps,etc\u201d (general rule not always)\n7) for paired passages: read 1st passage, answer 1st passage questions, read second passage and answer those questions and then do both questions. \n8) trust ur gut it\u2019s usually right",

Both are effective strategies but in the short term you will improve your reading score much faster by practicing the test. Seeing improvements in reading comprehension can easily take months to years depending on a variety of factors while nearly anyone will see score improvements within weeks by practicing SAT passages and getting the hang of the question types\n\nEdit: this isn't to say you can't combine these strategies nor that there is a blanket strategy for everyone. Someone that is already a proficient reader but struggles to read quick enough or deal with SAT questions will benefit more from doing practice passages than someone who struggles with basic reading comprehension.",

LOWEST is 1280.\n\nFrom there, I\u2019m going to keep climbing and go for a 1480 by August and I know I will do it.\n\n\nAll you need to do:\n\n*Study smarter not harder \n\n*Have a plan (find your weakness and get it MASTERED)\n* Be self-driven, want that target score, visualize it, feel that burning want.\n\n*BE CONSISTENT (Important asf)\n\n* Cliche asf but very true: don\u2019t give up (I\u2019ve had moments where I wanted to quit and go test optional but I kept pushing my self and now I\u2019m realizing that it was just ME who said I can\u2019t do it but in reality, I can)\n* Personal tip tho: Stay physically healthy.

I started with 1050, then 1430, then most recently 1520, and I am waiting on my last score, which I probably got 1550-1570. particular order. \n\nI know how to improve the English score. The best way is to use Meltzer's reading and writing prep books. Diligently go through them and take many many practice tests as possible. Definitely do official tests 1-10 minimum before your next one, but first, go through the prep books. Take notes and do all the practice in them. \n\nFor math, really, any prep book should work to learn the concepts. After that, the key is writing things down. Honestly, write literally all your work on paper, and do nothing in your head; that's where easy mistakes are made; the same goes for the English section, as Meltzer's book explains. After that, I like to do the questions in a particular order that guarantees the max number of points. Section 3: 1-10, 16-18, 11-15, 19-20. Section 4: 1-20, 31-36, 21-30, 37-38. \n\nAnd remember, answer something for every question always; if you don't know, just move on; and if you get stressed, remember a lot of schools are test-optional, and there are always more chances and the ACT instead!\n\nAfter studying, then grind out those practice tests. My suggestion is to study in the summer and take the August and October SAT tests. You should easily be able to knock it out in August. Hope this helps, and best of luck!",

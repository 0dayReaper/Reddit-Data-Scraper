    "postText": "In order to submit an application into a medical program I'm trying to get unto i need to be able to make a 1200 on the SAT with minimum of 600 in Math and 600 in evidence based reading a writing or a target ACT score of 26. Essays and writing portions for both aren't required. I have about a month and a half to take the test to get one of these minimum scores. Is it possible ? If so, what is the best way to go about doing this? I will study my ass off any way I can to make these scores. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I haven't taken these tests in well over 10 years so my math is definitely rusty. I really only have one shot at both and then I would have to wait another year to get into the program I'm trying to get into and time restrictions. \n\nThank you.",

Hitting 1200 is not a particularly daunting task.",

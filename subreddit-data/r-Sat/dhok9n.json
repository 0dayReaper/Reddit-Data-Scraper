I'll post my sources.\n\nThese schools are the top 20 schools according to US News. I know US News isn't the most accurate but it should give you a general idea of how many universities care about the essay. If they are bolded, they require or recommend the essay. If they are not bolded, they do not require or recommend the essay.\n\nPrinceton University\n\nHarvard University\n\nColumbia University\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nYale University\n\nStanford University\n\n**Duke University (Recommended)**\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nNorthwestern University\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nDartmouth College\n\nBrown University\n\nVanderbilt University\n\nCornell University\n\nRice University\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\n**University of California Los Angeles (All of the UCs require the Essay)**\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nSources: \nhttps://blog.prepscholar.com/schools-that-require-the-sat-essay\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities\n\nSo you're argument is that it's one of the \"most decisive factors for differentiating you with other applicants\" yet the most selective colleges don't use them. Totally seems right.\n\nEdit: And no it's not \"one of the\" decisive factors. It isn't a factor at all. I doubt that colleges even take a look at your essay score.\n\nEdit2: Here's a quote from the PrepScholar post\n\n&gt; Currently, no Ivy League School requires students to take the SAT with Essay; the same is true for Caltech, Duke, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, and UChicago. Many of these schools no longer even recommend students take the SAT with Essay, which is a huge turnaround from even a couple of years ago.",

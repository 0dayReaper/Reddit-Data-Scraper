Then you compare the y values to both inequalities.\n\nIdk if it takes less time for everyone but ig it did for me\n\n\nEdit: just saw a faster method in the comments",

After that, you just look at each choice and compare it to the graph u made.\n\nBut I think plugging in numbers is easier than this way.",

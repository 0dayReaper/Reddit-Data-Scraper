    "postText": "My SAT for June 3rd just got cancelled. There is a chance that they might reschedule it, but I don't think that's likely. If I wanted to just retake it a different official date, the closest testing centers are a minimum of 50 miles away for all of the upcoming SAT dates until December. That is just too far for me. I had initially got a 1370, 680 RW and 690 Math, but I didn't study much and didn't improve my RW score at all from my PSAT, hence why I was retaking in the first place. But now that it was cancelled and all, is it really worth retaking? Biggest thing I needed my SAT score for was merit-based scholarships as I won't qualify for many of the need-based ones. Help!",

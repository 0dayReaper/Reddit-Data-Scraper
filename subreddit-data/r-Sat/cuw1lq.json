Yes, it mentions rats a lot, but later on. You have to remember to be conscious of location. Because it was in the beginning of the passage, it is most likely intended to act as an introduction to the topic, hence the broadness.\n\n- You should not assume that they are talking about the rats. If the subject isn't stated, context is most important. The importance is that the subject is \"some.\" Rats aren't some, they're one. \"Some\" implies a diverse roster of subjects.\n\n- Befriend means to become a friend. It's not an ironic wink at the reader\u2014if you examine the tone of the passage, it's largely objective and straightforward. Befriend implies mutualism. Yes, perhaps there were benefits initially involved and domestication seemed sort of ludicrous, but the \"even\" implies that they were talking about the ludicrous. \n\nThink about it this way: \nSome people can live with former enemies: they may share food, share space, and some may even befriend the former foe. \n\nThe X people who live in cautious peace with the Y people are significantly less emaciated than their feuding counterparts. \n\nIn that case, the premise is similar, but you wouldn't consider \"befriend\" to mean \"take advantage of\".\n\n\n\n\nAnyway if the answer is not domestication I guess I just gotta lie in my premade bed of shame haha yeet",

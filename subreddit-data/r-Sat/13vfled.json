            "comment": "This is the way I did it, but there might be simpler ways: substitute r, the total amount need to be payed with 10, as in they have to pay 10 dollars over the entire month, substitute m, the total members with 10, as in they need to split 10 dollars across 10 members substitute k for 5, as in 5 members didn\u2019t make the payment. Now because each member need to pay 1 dollar, however 5 of them didn\u2019t make the payment on time, thus the remaining members must pay an extra 1 dollar, plug in all the numbers for each variable and see which one nets you 1, which is d",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

            "comment": "Let's say that r (the total rent) is $6000, and m (the renters) are 6. To find how much will each member pay, you'll divide 6000/6= $1000 (each member will pay $1000) or r /m (how much will each member pay)\n\nNow let's say that k (the guy who can't pay) is one. In this case, and since they will not pay, the rent will be diturbuted over the other 5. So 6000/5 which is $1200.\n\nTo find the additional amount each member will pay without k. We subtract, 1200 - 1000 = 200. Each member will have to pay an additional $200\n\nLet's generalize it. Since we subtract 1000 from 1200 then we should subtract r /m from r /m-k\n\nSo, (r /m-k) - (r /m). We make a common denominator. We get (rm - r(m-k)) / (m(m-k)).\n\n(rm - rm + rk) /(m(m-k))\n\n(rk) / (m(m-k)) which is D\n\nI hope this helped",

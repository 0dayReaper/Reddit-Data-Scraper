The main reason was because I love taking that test, the rush I get from opening the book and flipping to a new section, the rush I get when I go back from a different section makes every minute of stressing, continuous thinking and exhaustion worth it. I didn\u2019t like taking the SAT at first (who does anyways?), it was hard for me to sit in a place for hours, it was hard for me to study what I messed up on, it took a lot of self discipline to work my way up the SAT social hierarchy ladder. But, I became more disciplined, I asked myself how bad I wanted a higher score, I told myself to look at how far I came, that I shouldn\u2019t give up now, and I didn\u2019t: I became addicted to taking the SAT.  Soon, answering only 158 questions became inadequate in satisfying my desire of flipping though the booklet... of thinking smartly... of feeling exhausted... And there was only so much SATs you could sign up for in a given year and only so many practice exams you could take before you ran out. And then it hit me, no one gives a fuck about your SAT scores and so I finally quit thinking about taking another one.",

I started with almost a 1300 maximum then improved to 1380 by October and on 2 weeks later i was around 1410 i studied till December and significantly improved and my worst case scenario is getting a 1490 on December. When i was at 1380 i wished i could break the 1400 barrier but now i don't even feel that happy with the 1490 i wanna break the 1550. Some may say we are just proud brats who don't appreciate the opportunities we got but they don't feel how we feel. Nothing feels more satisfying than breaking down a reading passage and getting your answers correct and nothing is better than not understanding the history passage and get no mistakes in it. Nothing is better than not being able to solve a math question and then go back to it later and creatively solve it your own way without tricks. I guess this is just us..",

    "postText": "Good afternoon, everyone! Recently, I took the SAT (written version) and scored a 1300 on it. This was an improvement from my 1210 on the PSAT that I previously took; however, I still wasn\u2019t satisfied. I just took the DSAT to compare (and see which test I like more) and got a 1460 on it. How did this happen? My reading score jumped up 60 points, whilst my math score jumped up 100 points. Also, should I focus my energy on studying for the DSAT now? I\u2019m am going to be a Junior next year, which means I can only take the DSAT at the end of the year. Or, I can study this summer for the SAT whilst it\u2019s still on paper. Thanks for the help!",

Much less text to sort through, less need to take notes or recall information. Honestly, with the right strategies you can knock out most of the questions in under a minute, and now there's even more time per question.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! To preface, I recently registered for the August SAT, but I want to get a score that is at least 1360 or higher. The only thing I have to prepare with is Khan Academy though. As a breakdown of the specifics that I am doing, I'm doing the regular 20 questions every week day, with practice tests every other Friday. However, I am also trying to relearn the concepts and some of the more basic things, so alongside this I am doing some of the courses. The ones I should be finished with by the time this SAT, which is in 3 months, is Algebra Basics, Get Ready for Geometry, High School Geometry and College Algebra. When I finish with these I won't be able to finish the future courses listed but I will work on them as much as possible, those being Statistics and Probability and Linear Algebra. For the practice tests that I have done so far, the first one I got 1060 and the second I got 1210.\n\nSo I suppose my question is, is it possible for me to get a 1360+ for the SAT in August, providing they don't cancel me again?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s definitely possible if you really focus on improving the topics you struggle with. Don\u2019t just speedrun practice questions; try to understand why you got a question wrong and identify what types of questions you consistently get wrong. It looks like you\u2019re focusing on improving your math- what helped me get my math up from a 520 to an 800 was drilling the types of questions that I got wrong and watching Youtube videos explaining how precisely to do them (circle problems in particular).",

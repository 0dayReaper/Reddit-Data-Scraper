I don't do too hot in math so I got a math tutor to get my math score to 800. I got tutoring every other day for two hours for around 2 to 3 weeks. I went through packages of math questions, the trick is really practice. As for reading and writing, I made a mistake log. I took every mistake I ever made on the sat and I psychoanalyzed them. I added why I got it wrong and what I need to do to improve. I worked through most of the Kaplan reading book. Took maybe 2 or 3 practice tests. I got a 780 on reading and 800 in math on my August SAT. For math the trick is practice (and get tutoring if there are concepts you haven't covered) and watch Khan academy videos (not the ones on the SAT practice questions but search up entire units of videos). For reading, make mistake logs, analyze your mistakes, if you keep getting words in context wrong for example, work SOLELY on words in context questions to eliminate those mistakes. You have to remember to use evidence, everything has evidence, match up keywords and find sentences that say the answer choices. You have to get into the mindset.",

I don't think the whole process should be tweaked just to give us better chances of getting into US universities, as that would be unfair to Americans.",

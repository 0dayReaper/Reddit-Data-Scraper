    "postText": "I am a slow worker. I\u2019m usually one of the last to finish tests in basically all subjects but I usually do well on them. I am so much more capable when I have more time to think. I\u2019ve taken 3 SATs and spent hours studying, yet I feel like I\u2019m still at square one. Time is almost always an issue for me, especially in the reading sections. When I time myself doing practice passages, I usually finish within the time allotted or with time to spare but come test day, I swear time moves faster. This is more of a rant than anything but I would appreciate any advice anyone is willing to give.",

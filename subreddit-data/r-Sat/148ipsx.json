    "postText": "Hi everyone, I was wondering if the Khan Academy SAT practice is a great tool to improve my score. Currently I am receiving around a 1380-1450 on many practice tests in a couple of review books while my desired score is 1550+. I\u2019m considering shifting most of my review to khan as they have partnered with the college board. So is khan effective?",

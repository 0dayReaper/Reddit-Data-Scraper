I can say for sure my killer is the writing section (as unusual as that is). I know most grammar rules, but it seems like each time there are a few questions that are completely unintuitive and I don\u2019t answer correctly. How can i get 3 or less mistakes consistently? Can anyone help me by providing key tips or strategies?",

Something that helped me improve to get very few questions wrong on this section was just taking my time and actually reading through the passage, as I\u2019d usually finish the writing section very early. Make sure you try every answer choice and see which one sounds the best in your head. Also, make sure you know when to use a dash, colon, and semicolon because I find those to be tricky. You might also wanna brush up on vocab.",

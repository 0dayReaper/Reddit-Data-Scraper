            "comment": "I have ADHD and am also on adderall and had the same problem, especially with the reading section where i wasnt even close to finishing at first. The Erika Meltzer SAT reading strategies helped me so much, and would def recommend the book. I order the passages i read from topic of most to least interesting, where the time pressure helps me focus on those harder passages at the end. I do the science passages first, then social science, then history, then literature. In order from easiest to most difficult for me.\nIn addition to ordering the passages, I answer the questions as i read it. As soon as I start on a passage, i go to the questions, find any questions that reference specific lines or paragraphs and circle/underline/ put symbols around those specific sections of text on the passage itself.  This usually takes about 30 seconds. Then, as i read, whenever i pass over one of those lines i go to the questions to answer. Usually i will see if i can answer the adjacent questions with my knowledge at that point as well. Besides the first question of a passage( which is often a main idea question) the rest of questions tend to be in the order that the passage progresses. \n\nI also underline/ circle freely as i read which helps my comprehension.\n\nFor math I\u2019ve never had this issue so i don\u2019t have many tips.\n\nFor writing i still struggle with timing but practice and familiarity has got me to the point where I\u2019m now finishing in time although barely.\n\nAlso amphetamines (Adderall) can lose effectiveness if you eat breakfast shortly before taking them. If you don\u2019t normally experience adverse side effects from skipping breakfast with adderall (jitters, muscle spams, muscle tension), I would recommend skipping breakfast or eating breakfast at a different time.\n\n[source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/030079902125000840)\n\nYou can copy the doi into sci hub if you want the full article.\n\nGood luck!",

Then I go back and do all of the ones I skipped. That way i know i answered everything i was 100%. If i know i have 0 chance with it i instantly guess and move on so that i don\u2019t end up going back to it. With reading I almost never read the whole passage unless it\u2019s 100% necessary. I only read the questions and skim til i find my answer. though i do end up changing my answers as I read more answering later questions lmao",

            "comment": "Response from someone without ADHD, but who struggled with finishing the reading and math sections at first:\n\nTL;DR\n---------------------------------------------------\n- Star and skip questions to minimize wasted time, but still pick and bubble an answer in case you don't have time to go back\n- try to avoid re-reading as much as possible. It's better to read slowly and consistently than re-read a section twice and then once more when you reach the questions.\n- if you ever feel yourself drifting, look up to the clock, tell yourself how much time you have left, and then keep going\n- for math, if you really can't finish, start with the FRQs so you can guess on the ones you don't get to\n- for math calc, use a graphing calculator (borrow one from your local/school library if you don't have one) and work faster, checking with your calculator, rather than doing the problems slowly and carefully. Make sure you know how to use the graphing functions of your calculator, like how to trace, find dy/dx (slope), find min/max, intercepts, and more. If you can (assuming it's allowed by CB), get one that can solve algebra.\n\nReading Section (1):\n---------------------------------------------------\nThe best way to not space out and run out of time for me is to never repeat tasks. A lot of people will tell you to read the questions first so you know what you're looking for; this is good if you can multitask, but horrible if you're already struggling to focus. Instead, read the passage *slower* than you think you should, and focus on the reading. Going slower makes you focus on the pace, and help you stay concentrated, and in the end even make you finish faster. You also have more understanding of the text. If you reach a part you don't understand, guess what it's talking about or just move on\u2014it's better to come back to that sentence when you understand the focus of the text more than to spend a minute staring at it. Now, when you go to the questions, you can answer like 3/5 of them without ever referring to the passage, and even with some of the \"which sentence best supports\" questions, you might have an answer in mind you can look for (of today's test, this happened like for like 4 of them, which isn't the majority, but is still good).\n\nWhenever you begin to overthink, or when your mind wanders, look at the clock and then look back down. Try to aim for the reading section to finish 1 question a minute, as your pace will slow over time.\n\nOn the topic of answering questions, never pause. At all. Read every question fully, and all the answers. If you have no idea in 5 secs, re-read the question. If you have no idea for another 10 secs, star and move on (note: they say to never mark this on your answer sheet, but it's way easier to reference the answer sheet than to look through your book. So mark it there, lightly, and just erase it after you go back and answer the question). If you are unsure but have some ideas, create a simple system to minimize how much you have to re-read. Here's mine w/ examples:\n\nIf the answer is definitely wrong (opposite of intended answer, speaks from wrong POV, is inherently false, etc.), Slash it.\nIf there seems fishy but there's nothing inherently wrong or right, (introduces new topic, very rushed, monotonous) leave it alone.\nIf answer relates to the text or sounds correct (on topic, well written, etc.), Dash it.\nFrom there, focus only on the ones you dashed. If you see something new that's wrong, slash them. If you realize nothing is quite right, move on to the unmarked options, of select the best answer. If you don't have an answer after 30-ish secs of debating, select from the reasonable options at random, star it, and go back later if you have time. It's better to guess on 3 questions with limited certainty than to only answer one.\n\nExample // skip for more info\n\n[[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]]\n\nI can't attest to this strategy for the SAT yet as I am yet to receive my score, but here's my stats for the AP LANG previous tests I did as practice, which are basically SAT reading questions on steroids (all of these were controlled tests from previous years, some on the old question count and some on new, so I'll use percentages):\n\n1st test: 53.333%\n2nd test: (using the strategies that just don't work for me) 34.545%\n[New strats]\n3rd: 88.889%\n4th: 84.444%\n5th &amp; final: 90.901%\n\nI went from being horrible at the MC, finishing with like 10q left, to getting around 87%.\n\n[[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]][[]]\n\nWriting Section (2):\n---------------------------------------------------\nDuring the writing section, look out for missing connections, especially where there seems to be a gap in questions, and even more so when there's a number at the bottom of the paragraph. You be able to answer every paragraph re-ordering question without looking at the options. Tip: focus on names. CB loves using names to reveal the sentence order. 4 times if 5, if a name is used that hasn't been previously mentioned, the sentence or paragraph revealing it goes directly in front of said other sentence. Do these questions come up that often? No, only in about half the passages. But it saves you from re-reading an entire paragraph, or, worse, scanning the whole passage, and staying in the flow of the writing section makes it less likely that you'll space out when you now (don't) have to re-read.\n\nAlso, as a general tips for any pick-the-right-version-of the word (tense and stuff) questions, the answer is almost always in the sentence. If there are multiple clauses, copy the formatting of the previous/following clause. If there aren't, look for the subject, and decide if it's plural or not, and then determine past/present/future. Unless used in other clauses, avoid passive and complicated voice. \"Was choosing\" is chose, \"being annoying\" is just annoying, \"is puzzling to her\" is \"puzzles her\" and so on. \"It will also be remembered by Paisley\" is \"Paisley will always remember it.\"\n\nMath Section Non-Calc (3):\n---------------------------------------------------\nGo fast. If you can't start answering in 10 secs, or can't answer at all after 45, star and skip. If you really can't finish, start with the free-response, starring anything you can't start in 20 secs or finish in a minute. It's better to run out of time on the MC, that way you can guess. Also, I know these times sound unreasonably low, but this took me from having 4 complete guess questions and 2 unreached questions to finishing my first go-around with 12 mins left and giving an educated guess on 1 question (very happy ab that, I hate this section).\n\nTo summarize my recommendation for this section: be fast. If you stop at any time, move on. Give yourself a buffer by doing the other questions fast too, and come back later.\n\nMath Section Calc (4):\n---------------------------------------------------\nThis section is one where I have never struggled time-wise, often ending with 15-30 mins left (current SAT, last SAT, and practice SATs). The best tip for this section is to do as little as possible\u2014know your calculator. You're allowed to use a calculator, so do it. If you can, get a graphing calculator. Any question involving the solution to a series of equations, or what graph matches the equation, or the min or the max...just graph it and let your calculator tell you. For any algebra problems, solve it as fast as possible, not caring if you make mistakes, because, assuming you understand what you're doing at least partially, you won't make mistakes the majority of the time. Solve every question super fast and check with a calculator; hopefully you'll only get like 10% of your answer not working. Further, if you have a MC question asking for the value of something, you can just do guess and check with the answers. You can also use this to check problems where you're given an equation; just assign random values and test which equation works.\n\nI don't do all of these; it depends on the question, and often I can just solve the problem faster manually. But if you're struggling to focused on the math, it can be beneficial to just make the calculator do everything. If you do have any extra time from all the rushing, rather than spending it on solving the question, focus on the question. These are supposed to be simple questions the majority of people can answer, so more problems stem from understanding the goal than finding the correct option.\n\nAlso, like with the math non-calc section, if you really cannot finish, you should start with the free-response questions.\n\nAdditional note:\n---------------------------------------------------\nIf anything is on your mind, bothers you, or is distracting to you, tell the people in charge of your room!!! If you're nice, they'll normally respond in kind. The goal is everyone has the best testing experience possible.\n\nFor example, I *cannot stand* the sound of chewing gum. This isn't allowed during the test as it falls under eating, but most people aren't strict, and someone chewing from the writing section to the end of the test really threw me off during my first SAT (legit started tearing up in the middle of the math non-calc). So I made sure to ask about it, and because I did, she noted during the instructions that anyone chewing gum needs to spit it out. Also, during the first break, I kept stressing that my phone was going to buzz for no reason. I asked, and she let me turn it on (ensuring my phone screen was facing her) and manually silence every alarm, even though we both knew alarms cannot ring when a phone is fully powered off. Generally speaking, the proctors don't care.\n\nSide note:\n---------------------------------------------------\nBring yummy snacks. Breaks can mess up your flow. Eat candy (or something else you really want), and think about the section that's coming up.\n\nThese solutions won't work for everyone, but some of them might help! Good luck :D",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been improving my SAT score over the past 4 weeks from 1310 to 1490. However, I appear to be stuck here and can\u2019t get higher. I am reviewing all of my mistakes but there\u2019s no patterns, it\u2019s different types of questions each time. For math it\u2019s always silly mistakes too. It\u2019s rlly stressful because I don\u2019t have a lot of time and I\u2019d really like to get above 1500. What can I do today and tomorrow to prepare for June 3rd and hopefully break through the plateau???",

So don't worry about the curve, and just put in the effort to study... and if you do get a test w/ seemingly super easy questions, make EXTRA sure that you don't make any silly mistakes bc that means others will prolly find it easy too and the curve will not be merciful. (Ie. For math, I improved from 680 to 800 between March and August, where -1 was 770 and -2 was 750. I definitely did study, but even so, I think the easier test/bad curve helped bc I realized right away that I had to get through everything quick and check my work, whereas with a harder test/good curve, there probably would have been several questions I couldn't have gotten around to at all)\n\nTLDR; don't worry about finding a test with \"good\" curve, making sure to not make silly mistakes on an easier test with bad curve can get u a good score too :)",

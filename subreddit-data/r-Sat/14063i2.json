    "postText": "Hello everyone! So I\u2019m planning on getting uworld for the SAT as was suggested by everyone, but I\u2019m not sure when would be an appropriate time to get it.\n\nI just started studying for the SAT like a month ago and want to make sure I get the core concepts down (I\u2019ve been using khan academy + the black book). \n\nThis leads me to my question: when is it a good time to get/use uworld? When you have the core SAT concepts down or ASAP?",

I'm kind of worried about spending my whole summer doing all the questions and then becoming \"too fixated\" on a strat (if this makes sense!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, thank you for the short guide :D You just stopped me from inevitably making a post about how to use uworld lol",

I think doing all the questions and becoming fixated on a single strat is actually a good thing since the more you start to recognize question types, you can start solving them quicker and quicker since you know the strats. also, no problem!",

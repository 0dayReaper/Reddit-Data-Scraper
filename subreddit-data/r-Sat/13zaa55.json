The Eng section this time was \\*slightly\\* harder/confusing though, IMO. I'm sure there's quite a bit of luck with getting time consuming questions/harder questions from the question bank, and I got lucky this time. Also, I'm 100% sure I got the harder math module, in case you're wondering. \n\nHoping I get my goal score this time...",

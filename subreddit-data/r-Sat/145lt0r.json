    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m trying to understand how to interpret and gauge these scores. These are from testing year 2009. I also think they scale differently now. If my score was terrible, just tell me. I never saw these results until recently. 14 years later I\u2019m trying to piece together the reasons why I never got to go to college, and why I never got any acceptance letters. Thanks for the help! \n\n1380 overall - \n470 critical reading -\n470 math -\n440 writing -\nessay - 6",

Then I went to Public school for my last 2 years in high school. Because of the differences in those tests, and curriculum, I can\u2019t help but wonder if that was a major factor.",

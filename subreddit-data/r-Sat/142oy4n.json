    "postText": "Yesterday, I took a practice digital SAT on a site called \"Revolution Prep\" (Same format as the future official SAT), and my score came back as an estimated 1410-1500. I found the math and the writing parts to be extremely easy. Reading was a little more challenging. Reading/writing is the exact same with little bits of text per question. Math just has the same questions except you can just type in the numbers instead of bubbling them in. All questions are multiple choice except like 5-10 math questions. \n\nIf you want to know the layout of the exam, here it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1 First Module: Reading/Writing, 27 Questions, 32 minutes\n\nPart 1 Second Module: Reading/Writing, 27 Questions, 32 Minutes\n\n10 Minute Break\n\nPart 2 First Module: Math, 22 Questions, 35 Minutes\n\nPart 2 Second Module: Math, 22 Questions, 35 Minutes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, math has way too much time compared to reading/writing. I finished the math sections 10 minutes earlier than normal. The math section can also be used WITH A CALCULATOR. I think everyone's scores just got boosted by a couple hundred for the class of 2025 and above. Good luck class of 2024.",

As is the difficulty.\n\nIf it was an actual CB test, then it should be a decent estimate of an actual score.\n\nThe statisticians at CB equate the digital test to the exact same scoring scale as the previous test, since 2016, regardless of what you might think.",

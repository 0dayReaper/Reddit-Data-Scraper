    "postText": "So I know this sub is known as an echo chamber for SAT scores, but I was wondering, is a 1400 bad if I want to apply to more selective schools? Will everyone really be coming in with 1500+ scores? \n\nI took the May SAT &amp; I got a 730 reading and a 670 math. I have never once studied for an SAT in the slightest, so I thought this was a pretty solid score. But after looking at this sub, I don\u2019t know how to feel and I just need an objective opinion. \n\nIs a 1400 bad? Should I retake the SAT?",

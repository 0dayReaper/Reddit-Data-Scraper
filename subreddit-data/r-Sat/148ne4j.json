    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m having some concerns choosing between the Digital SAT or ACT, I\u2019m worried that since the new SAT seems a lot easier and I\u2019ve been able to get a much higher score that everyone else will as well, also the fact that international students who often score above average are taking the test and raising the average as well. My biggest concern is that by the time I\u2019m applying to college the SAT will be valued much less then the ACT and even a 1550+ will be worse then a 34. What do you guys think?",

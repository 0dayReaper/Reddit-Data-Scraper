Otherwise, you have a bunch of time to study for the upcoming tests so grind khan academy making sure to review mistakes and there are also a ton of QAS tests out there as well",

As a part-time SAT tutor for reading, I can verify that all of the students I have are just those whos parents want them to be motivated/forced to study with another person. If you\u2019re self-driven, you don\u2019t need a tutor.\n\n3. This math section no-calc was ROUGH\u2026 \n\n4. Timing is key. Take practice tests/khan tests with time. If you truly were using Khan Academy then there is a timer on there to pace you.",

ALWAYS ground yourself in the text when answering the reading questions. if you can\u2019t find something that directly proves the answer your choosing, its probably not the best choice. this isn\u2019t always applicable but it really helps when you\u2019re stuck between two choices.\n\n2. KEEP A NOTES SECTION !! when you take a practice test or problem and mess up, resolve the problem with the guide and note what it is you don\u2019t understand. this can be a quick reference and helpful.\n\n3. know the plural v. singular forms of the common have AND when to use they v. it\n\ni hope this helps\u2014 good luck !",

Since they are old tests, they are the closest thing to what you will eventually take.\n\nAlso, focus on what you don\u2019t know. If you find that you\u2019re missing mostly geometry questions on math, evidence questions for reading, and verb conjugations for writing, then focus on those areas. \n\nYou can do this!!",

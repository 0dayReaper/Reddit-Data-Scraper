            "comment": "Here\u2019s how u jack up ur reading score super quickly:\n1) for vocab in context, the word ALWAYS has the synonym in the next line or previous line or somewhere here close by. It will basically tell u exactly what word u need. For instance, if the word is \u201cinnocuous,\u201d the next sentence will probably describe the something as \u201charmless\u201d\n2) for notes questions, these are only asking you to follow instructions. Take your cursor and underline all the key word in the notes question. Now, if there\u2019s 2 parts to a notes question, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH PARTS IN YOUR ANSWER. If it ask for what choice best explains the study and the significance, you need a choice that does both\u2014-same with the questions where ur picking a peice of evidence.    \n3) for grammar, just last minute cram the rules with Erica Melter book \n4) for all other questions, you need to ask yourself \u201cdid the text I just read really state what\u2019s in the answer choices\u201d Don\u2019t make any assumptions, the answer choice has got to be grounded in the text.",

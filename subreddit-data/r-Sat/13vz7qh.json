            "comment": "B is the best answer. The convention being tested is tense. The key word here is 'Since', which emphasizes that something has occurred over an extended period of time. For example, I might say \"Julia has lived in New York since 1999.\" The implication is that Julia moved to New York in 1999 and that she continues to live there. In the question you've provided, kite-flying became a tradition 1400 years ago, stayed a delightful tradition for 1400 years, and remains a delightful tradition today.\n\nWords like 'since' and 'for' are clues that you need to use the present perfect ('has' + past participle form of the verb), and only B is in the present perfect.",

    "postText": "I've taken multiple QAS tests at this point in preparation for June 3rd and I'm a bit worried about the curve, so I was wondering how it would be determined. On the last few qas tests, I have gotten a 740, 750, 700, and a 750 (on EBRW). On all of these, I got a very similar amount of incorrect answers, always with about 5-7 wrong on Reading and 0-2 wrong on writing. However, as you can see, I got a pretty harsh score of 700 on one of them, so I was just wondering how the curve is determined and how everyone else perceives the difficulty of the EBRW sections (to me, all of the difficulties seemed pretty much the same).",

Similarly your university may require IELTS/TOEFL as proof of English - again a university specific requirement, not a US government requirement.\n\nYou will need to get a visa. This will require a letter of confirmation from the university and will also require you show evidence of sufficient financial resources to cover your expenses. You will also need to convince the government official that you don't pose a risk for illegal immigration.",

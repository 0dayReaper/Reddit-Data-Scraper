The first thing is to figure out where you are going wrong. In my case, right from the beginning, I was able to answer correctly but my reading speed and maybe even, vocabulary was a problem. I practiced RW daily and even read novels and articles. They help you to read better and can definitely improve your RW score.",

Practice is sometimes easier, sometimes harder, and half the time the content you need for your score doesn't actually show up on the real test (at least in the 1450+ range). If you want above that, use that amount of past tests. Past tests still might not have one or two new questions that an SAT you're currently taking has, but that's still a better ratio than if you used practice ones. Khan academy for basics, prepscholar's blog once you've exhausted that, and youtube for the last week or two.",

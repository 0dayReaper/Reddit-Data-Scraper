I didn\u2019t purchase the book digitally but i did subscribe to one of their plans and got a coupe additional lessons like demos, strategy, essential notes etc. along with the PDF version of the book. One of the biggest pros of the digital version imo was that almost all the questions had little videos explaining the answers.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s good. I used it and it helped me get better at math in general, but it only helped raise my score by a few points. I\u2019d say that going through the whole book, doing every math question on UWorld, and possibly going through Khan Academy\u2019s courses- from 2nd grade till Geometry- would make a greater impact on your score. The book helps you perform really well on practice tests 1-10, but when you come in contact with test outside of that bubble, especially really recent practice tests, you might notice that your score goes down because the book derives its \"SAT type questions\" from older tests. \n\nBasically, the book is great, but it needs to be supplemented by other sources if you\u2019re in dire need of a dramatic math score increase of 80 points or more.",

Me personally, I prefer book versions because it\u2019s most similar to the actual paper SAT. But overall, I think the book is very helpful.",

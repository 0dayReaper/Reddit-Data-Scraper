                            "comment": "Okay so idk if my reading score is completely accurate since my family kept distracting me and I just decided I should restart from the beginning and erased all my answers and moved to a quiet place, but anyways, here is what I did: \n\nReading: I got 3 wrong on this\n\n\\- Read the passage thoroughly; mumble the words and move my pencil and underline the text as I go along. I painted a mental picture of almost everything that was happening as I read, and if I found anything confusing, I would try to make sense of it, not completely, but just a basic understanding (for example, if I read a confusing sentence, I would go back 1-2 sentences and see how that sentence that confused me ties into the other sentences/passage so I can continue to truly understand the text as best as possible) \n\n\\- Immediately move onto the questions and don't focus on looking for the correct answer, but eliminating answer choices. BE EXTREMELY PICKY (Ex: hmm this sounds correct, but the main focus of the passage was rescuing animals , not restoring their populations - Cross this out immediately). There will be something that makes every answer wrong, and if you can't find it, go back to the text. Everything should be in the text. NEVER INFER. \n\n\\- Honestly, this is the hardest section to practice, and it is more about comprehension and truly understanding what you read. If you aren't reading closely already, start doing this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWriting: 1 wrong on this \n\n\\- (Easiest to improve on)\n\n\\- A bunch of grammar rules and stuff. Make sure to understand when to use a semicolon or period or comma or how to maintain parallel structure. Soon enough, with good practice, it should come very easy to you. You should realize that this is not the correct answer or grammatical choice and you can eliminate the answer. \n\n\\- For transitions: Look at the sentence before and after the transition and identify the relationship (contrasting, addition, causation) and pick the fitting transition\n\n\\- For sentence placement: Make sure when you move the sentence that it flows well and is relevant to where it is placed. If a passage goes from talking about the benefits of habitat rewilding to then introducing habitat rewilding, you know something is up. Everything surrounding the sentence should make sense, and reread to make sure it does\n\n\\- For revisions: If it is relevant add/keep it, if not, delete. These questions are kinda fairly easy, you can obviously tell if something should be there or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMath: 4 wrong on this\n\n\\- Another set of rules and stuff\n\n\\- Know your rules, know your question types, know how to solve specific question types, double check your answers ALWAYS, etc. \n\n\\- Once you get the rules down and know what to do in response to questions, it should start to flow as well\n\n\\- This is one that requires a bit of practice though\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall: \n\n\\- I STRONGLY recommend UWorld for practice, the section-based practice things help incredibly. Before my practice test I did like 7 writing passages and only ended up with 1 wrong on writing. Make sure to review your mistakes and understand why this answer is wrong, why the correct answer is correct, and what you should do next time to get the correct answer. Practice in areas you are weak. Best of luck my friend!!",

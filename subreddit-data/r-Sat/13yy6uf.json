            "comment": "The powers of the two notations are the same: 10^{30}. If 0.04% of 1.989*10^{30} is sulfur, that means that:\n\n.04/100 = .0004 \n\nOf the total mass is sulfur. So:\n\n1.989*10^{30}* .0004 = 0.0007956*10^{30}\n\nSo s = 0.0007965. Hope that clears it up.\n\nAlso don\u2019t use chat gpt for math help, it\u2019s often faulty (as you learned).",

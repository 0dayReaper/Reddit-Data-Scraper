            "comment": "It isn\u2019t worth retaking if the only thing you care about is admissions. HYPSM each have rating scales they give to their applicants. These rating scales vary greatly but in general, a top test score rating is a 35+ACT/1550+SAT. Even at Harvard, going through the statistical datasets of their admissions reveals that it\u2019s simply not possible for their top rating to be anything above. (On college confidential) I would strongly encourage you to spend your time doing something else. Whether that be conducting research and writing a research paper; studying for Physics/Bio/Linguistics/etc Olympiads; or simply spending that time making a great bond with a mentor or teacher for recs. Furthermore, at a school like Harvard a 1600SAT/4.0UW won\u2019t get you a top academic rating. The vast majority of people with top academic rating at Harvard get it because they have published research, insanely outstanding recs, or other showings of passion for learning. Also, for Stanford (I can verify as i have watched many admissions file reactions from current students) the cutoff for a top academic/test rating (Stanford combines them) is at a 1550SAT. \n\nEssentially, don\u2019t even let a thought of retaking the SAT enter your mind if your goal is to be as stellar as possible on your college apps. Please, go and do something else, do a passion project, whatever it is that suits you. \n\n\nThe only situation where I would suggest retaking it is if you want the 2 thousand dollar National Merit Scholarship. While a high PSAT score makes you a semi finalist, you basically need a 1590+ for finalist. In my opinion, if going for that score sacrifices literally ANY other part of your application even remotely, don\u2019t do it. 2000 dollars isn\u2019t worth it. \n\n\nTLDR: It\u2019s plenty and a 1550 will not hurt your application in ANY way. It will only help. \n\nCongrats on your amazing score!\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not a stupid question. I wanted to figure this out too before and I could never get a clear answer. Like I don\u2019t want to know if it\u2019s technically possible for me to get in with X score, I want to know if it\u2019s gonna help me if I get a higher score.",

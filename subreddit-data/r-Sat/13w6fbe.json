    "postText": "I\u2019m taking the SAT in August after studying over the summer but I\u2019m debating over 2 books for math. Should I buy the PANDA math book or the Black Book? Also should I get Erica\u2019s book for reading/writing or is a different book better? My highest sat score is a 1250 620 RW and 630 M, if you can assign a book based on those scores. Thanks.",

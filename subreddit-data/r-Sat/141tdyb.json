    "postText": "So I took the June SAT on Saturday at a high school, and during Section 1 (Reading), our proctor put the wrong ending time on the whiteboard (9:51 instead of 9:41). The 65 minutes for the reading section ended at 9:41, but everyone in our room thought that it ended at 9:51 because of the board, so naturally they were shocked when time was called at 9:41. \n\nFortunately, I realized halfway through that the proctor wrote the wrong timing on the board, but I didn't want to potentially waste my time by going up to her and telling her. But then after the Section ended, everyone started complaining about how they thought they had more time left, and that we should get more time to \"compensate\".\n\nOur proctor talked to other administrators at the high school and she decided that she won't give us extra time, but that she was gonna fill out an \"irregularly circumstances report\" to College Board. She also gave some BS reason that this was gonna benefit us and that we would get \"extra points\" (obviously this was not how it was gonna work). \n\nThis whole event didn't really affect my testing conditions too much, and I don't want  my score to get canceled in any way. Does anyone know the consequences for an irregular circumstances report and will I be given the option to choose whether my s scores be cancelled or not ?",

            "comment": "You'll *probably* have the option to keep your scores, and The College Board will likely give you the opportunity to take the test again for free but there's really no way to know. Since the compromise didn't advantage you (or anyone else), it's unlikely they'll just spontaneously cancel scores. Remember, their big incentive is to minimize the number of people taking free makeups... Those makeups require brand new tests so from an R&amp;D perspective this is very expensive for them.",

I emailed the test coordinator asking about the location and she answered my question and then also said it was at 9 and then signed the email saying \u201csee you tomorrow at 9.\u201d Does this mean that I show up at 9, or is that when the test starts? I know you\u2019re usually supposed to get there at 7:45 but is it different for accommodated tests?",

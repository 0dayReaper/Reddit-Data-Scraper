    "postText": "Helloooo,\n\nSo I got my PSAT 10 scores back and I got a 1070 on it. I only got about 10 questions wrong in the ela section but got about half the questions wrong in the math section. I was planning on studying around 2 hours a day for the summer using prep books, Khan Academy and online resources. I was wondering if I could get around 1400's if I take the test in November as I want to focus on extracurriculars in my junior year. Am I being realistic with myself or am I getting too ahead of myself? Thank you!",

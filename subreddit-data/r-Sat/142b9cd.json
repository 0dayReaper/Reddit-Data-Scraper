The problem is if you were to spend 6 hours per day, you\u2019d probably burn out. There\u2019s a lot of time in summer and spending 6 hours a day per day is a lot of time you could be spending doing something else that\u2019s enjoyable but still take time out to study for the SAT.",

            "comment": "Firstly if your math is good that\u2019s great. You do not need to spend that much time a day! What I would do is a hour and a half for section 1, partaking in doing a full reading section, then reviewing it in DEPTH and understanding why your wrong and why what\u2019s right is right. After to start with the grammar section, start with the basics learning the concepts of the tested aspects. Nonessential appositives, parallelism, idioms clauses, general grammar rules etc. I think one good hour of this is all you need and probably for a week or two at most then you should get the hang of them. Right after you review, take a section two test (35 minute) and once again REVIEW IN DEPTH. It\u2019s all about applying what you just reviewed here. You\u2019re about at three hours right now. For math, if you\u2019re scoring that high that\u2019s great, but see if there are types of questions you\u2019re missing, and then master those. If it\u2019s not an ability to do math those holding you back from consistent 780-800 then figure out if it\u2019s not being careful reading or something for the questions (that\u2019s what it was for me lol). This could take an hour at most I\u2019d say, and you could probably cut this down further into the summer hopefully in less then a month. Message me if you have any questions",

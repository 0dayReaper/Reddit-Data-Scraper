We can automatically cross out B and D because no where nearby was it talking about that. This leaves us with A and C. While A makes sense for the proceeding sentence, it doesnt connect to what comes after in the paragraph as well as what came earlier, making C the most logical answer. Good luck to you on your studies friend.",

It's a pretty common type of question: how many free throws in a row do you need to hit to raise your average to a specific number, how many red balls do you need to add to increase your probability to a number, how many socks do you have if adding 10 white ones increases the probability of grabbing a white one to a number, etc. Once you figure out how to approach them, they should be pretty quick to do...",

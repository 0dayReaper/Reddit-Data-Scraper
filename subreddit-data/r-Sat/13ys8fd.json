    "postText": "On the practice tests ive taken ive gotten\n\n1510: one like 3 weeks ago\n\n1520: like 2 weeks ago\n\n1530:Around a week ago\n\n1560: 3 days ago\n\n1590:2 days ago\n\n1580:Yesterday\n\nOn the 2 most recent ones I tried to replicate shitty conditions as much as possible. Being tired, having less time, distracting environment etc. I still feel like it might just be luck and I am missing some knowledge.  I also have had a lot of stress recently and its affecting school tests.  Like, my heartrate was 175 bpm during one of my tests and I ended up only getting a 90.\n\nWith all this, what do you guys think Ill get on my actual test and should I sign up for the august test ahead of time?",

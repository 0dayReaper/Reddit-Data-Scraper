For math I didn\u2019t really prep for because I\u2019m a pretty strong math student so not sure how to help there. And for writing just make sure you understand all the English grammar rules and word misconceptions. After that juts practice a lot. I know this isn\u2019t a lot but it\u2019s the only thing that helped me",

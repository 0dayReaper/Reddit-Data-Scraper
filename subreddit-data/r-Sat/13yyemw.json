    "postText": "I've never taken it before. I took the ACT and scored well, but I thought I would register for this too and see how I do. A LOT of shit happened between my registering for it and tmrw, so I did the bare minimum in terms of studying. We'll see how it goes. I did an SAT camp like three years ago. Reading/Writing wasn't too bad for me, but I'm a teensy bit worried about math. \n\nI'm making this post because I want to know if there are others in the same boat \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Anyways thanks for your input",

I don't know if I plan on taking it again this fall or not, for I hear that SAT scores matter less for college applications nowadays. Ivy league schools weren't even on my radar until I got this email, and I will say their engineering program intrigues me. I plan on applying but don't know if submitting my SAT score would help me or hurt me. From what research I've done it seems that a 1400 would put me under the 10th percentile of scores of accepted applicants. Something I might have going for me, however, is that I am from a rural, small school, and my class is only 61 students. I got the highest score of my class by 50 points, so I don't know if that's something they'll even be made aware of or if that's irrelevant information in a circumstance such as this. If I don't get accepted its no big deal, and I don't expect to anyways, just thought that when the time comes to apply I should at least try to get in.",

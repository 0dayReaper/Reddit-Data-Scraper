What I have been doing is taking practice exams, then going back through them with a youtube video of someone doing the test, this gives good insights on the test that you may have missed! I search TikTok for SAT tips, tricks, strategies, etc, which I hate to say, has made me enjoy taking another practice exam, as I will know another trick to use on the test. Furthermore, this allows me to view the next test I take as a game with a new possible high score. Additionally, I like to view it as going to a beginning level of a video with maxed-out gear and one-shotting everything![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy), this has helped keep my mind in a more positive them while studying, hope it helps!  \n\n\nTLDR: Find tips, tricks, and strategies, to help you on the test, then when you go to study questions, picture the score you get as a new high score in a game. My current high score is 1230, which is 230 up, from less than a month of studying, this can help give you a feeling of accomplishment!",

No passport, no learner\u2019s permit, no license, no student ID, no anything \ud83d\ude14. ALL THAT STUDYING WAS FOR NOTHING. Its okay tho. I\u2019ll just reschedule the test for August 26, which will now and only be the first SAT test I take. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m taking it twice as an upcoming senior, so the August one is the one that\u2019s gonna count. I\u2019m really disappointed in myself for not having an ID, but at least I can study and be more prepared in the summer. Is there anyone in the same situation? Because I feel and understand you. We were prepared, but didn\u2019t have all the necessary resources to take it \ud83e\udee4 It happens, don\u2019t bring yourself down too much about it. Lastly, for those who did take it, how was it? Bad, Good, Easy, etc?",

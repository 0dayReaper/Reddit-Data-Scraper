The fence lengths was all equal to x so to find the length of one the remaining sides (that weren't equal to 30 ft) it would be (x-30) and divide that by 2 because those two sides were equal lengths. So final equation for area would be that side (x-30)/2 times the side given (30). Hope this helps",

A list of permitted calculators can be found [here](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy). In brief, all four-function and all scientific calculators are allowed, as are most graphing calculators.

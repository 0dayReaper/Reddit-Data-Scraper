    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am beginning to study for the SAT since I am a rising junior. I took a full-length practice SAT today on Khan Academy (#1) and received a 1490 (750M, 740R&amp;W). However, I also took the Huntington diagnostic test earlier this week and got 1330 (710M, 620R&amp;W). I don't get what caused this huge difference in scores. Are the SAT practice tests on Khan Academy easier, or are Huntington's tests harder?",

    "postText": "for those who already took the sat and hopefully had similar questions to what i had, there was a 'most precise and logical word question' about demand and price with choices like monetise, exploit or stabilise. what answer did you all get for that? also there was another same type question about paintings and exaggeration in them with choices between counteract and accentuate. what is the answer for that too?  \nlastly, a math question for the conditions that would prove that two triangles are congruent, between I II and III. could anyone let me know if they had any of these questions, and if yes, what their answer is?",

But idk bcs i chose pretexts which is probably wrong \nDamn 800 or 780 i can only dream but i will get it one day (inshallah) i got 750 on the may(my first one) attempt.\n800 seems impossible",

Inducements was the other way around for me. I don\u2019t like questions like this where it depends on your own personal definitions of words\u2026\n750 is a strong score already, any higher and you can get a mid 1500 with a strong math score.

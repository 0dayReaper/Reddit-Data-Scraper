I\u2019ve heard that the early practice tests are easier compared to the later ones, but I got through R&amp;W with only 3 mistakes, 1 of which being misclick that I\u2019m positive I didn\u2019t make.\n\nSorry if this coming off as humble bragging, but it\u2019s just that I want to know if I\u2019m just doing an easy one.",

This means the scoring table was resultingly harsh. A typical -5 in each section would result in a score 80 points lower than the median of those tests.\n\n[https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/](https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/)\n\nThose factors offset, meaning the 400-1600 score is consistent with all others.",

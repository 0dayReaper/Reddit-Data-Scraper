Reading, the more you do the better you will get at finding the MOST correct answer (there's always more than one, your job is to pull out the best one) and also summarizing things properly and pulling out the main message. Only practice will help with that.\n\nWriting, do a ton of questions - if you find repeating mistakes, for me it was semicolons, then stamp them out by learning the theory behind it and you ought to be good. It helps to read \"aloud\" in your head - if it sounds weird saying it it's probably not right. The more practice you do the better you'll do - I have faith in you! Practice can improve anybody's skills :)",

It's **so** tedious that many students will never do it.\n\nFirst however, you should recognize that **your errors are not careless, but human**. Your problem isn't carelessness: it's error control. Errors must be visible to be correctable. Hence the fix lies in changing your process to make your errors visible.\n\nHere is the **magic solution** for progressing from knowing all of the math to (usually) getting every question correct:\n\n* Rewrite the given, as given, including the question, always\n* Write out your work. Very little should occur in your head that doesn't land on the paper\n* Clearly eliminate each wrong answer by crossing out both the answer and letter\n* Circle your answer choice\n* Enter fill in your bubble sheet\n\nPersonal experience: I make at least as many errors as the average person, probably more, because I have a tendency to rush. But using this approach, I usually catch all of them. When I took the SAT I missed three math questions. When I took the GMAT I missed zero. The difference was a better process.\n\nhttps://schecteracademicservices.com/",

The gap between talent and excellence is bridged through process, technique, and lots of practice.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not expect to master this approach quickly. It's unnatural. It takes most people a solid 3-6 months of intentional, rigorous repetition to make this method habitual. It's simple and easy to understand, but like golf, tennis, foul shots, playing the violin, etc., you have to force yourself to practice, because you have to do it on **every** question.\n\nWhy? If you've mastered all of the math, then the probability that you miss a question has little to do with objective difficulty, because *none* of the questions is difficult. Hence you're nearly as likely to miss question 1 as you are to miss question 15.",

I constantly took practice tests over the summer and was getting in the high 1300s so I expected I could have a chance at getting a 1400 in August. I'm so disappointed in myself and don't know what to do now. I'm taking the test again in October but wanted to reach out to ask those of you who did really well on the test or improved a lot for some help. Thank you.",

I would read my answer and see if it matches correctly with what the question is asking. This helped me prevent simple mistakes. As for English, just review your mistakes and understand why you got a question wrong.

I know that there were quite a few times when I was jumping between answers, especially with the probability and the triangle question, but I think that it tested all general topics. There was nothing like finding the area of a hexagon or something generally vague. I really suggest doing the QAS papers for math because they show you the general trend (The last few papers have all had box plot graphs). I think that the SAT is reverting to focusing on diligence on Math more than any other section. The paper is easy because they want to make sure that you won't make basic mistakes when you solve easy problems in life (like paying people). I mean you honestly deserve a bad score if you pay someone the wrong amount just because you made a careless error in your calculation.   \n\n\n(Please leave a comment anything I can do the improve in English Reading though...

I had been giving the linear tests on college board just for extra practice and was always scoring 1450+ in all of those, however i just took the 4th practice test on bluebook and score a whopping 1360.\n\nAny advice for math or English will be great. I only have 4 days left for the test so kindly keep that in mind .",

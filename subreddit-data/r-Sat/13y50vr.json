We know that the other side of the equation is radius^2 so 81=9^2. We have the radius of the circle but we need the diameter since the radius is half of the square side. So 9x2= 18. The perimeter of a square is 4c so 4x18= 72",

It will have vertex (h,k) and radius r\n\nYou want this form, so first put variables on one side and constants on the other\n\nx\\^2 - 10x + y\\^2 - 6y = 47\n\nNow complete the square by adding necessary coefficients\n\n(x\\^2 - 10x +25) + (y\\^2 - 6y + 9) = 47 + 25 + 9\n\nNote that whatever coefficients you added to the left side, you also had to add to the right.\n\nNow you have r\\^2 = 47 + 25 + 9 = 81 (based on original equation). Radius is 9. Can you get the perimeter (circumference) of the circle from here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm dumb - find the perimeter of the square with side length 2r lol.",

            "comment": "If a circle is inscribed in a square, that means the diameter is equal to the side length of the square (you may draw it to visualize). So you find the radius from the equation, you then double it to find the diameter, which is 18. So the perimeter of the square will be 4\\*18 = 72.",

If you look at the graph of this circle, the distance maximum to the minimum is 18 units. This is the length of one side of the square, given the circle was inscribed in the square. 18 times 4 equals 72. There you have it.",

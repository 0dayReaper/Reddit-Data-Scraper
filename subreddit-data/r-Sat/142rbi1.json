    "postText": "I am a sophomore going into junior year in a couple of months. I know the SAT is coming up and I will start studying this summer so I understand what I'm getting into. I was looking for a place to prep with my father until our landlord (whose daughter scored 1600) recommended this Prep place that has a lengthy schedule. Every week of the summer it has 2 classes on Monday and Wednesday. Both 3 hours in the morning and one focused on reading and one on math. After those two sessions, every weekend Saturday morning I take a complete SAT practice test. At the end of the 8 weeks of this program, I take the test for real before entering my Junior year. I don't mind working all that time for the test I just want to know that it's not being wasted. I am really trying to get input on if I need all this time for the test. I asked my girlfriend's brothers (One is a student at Columbia, and the other is a student at Northeastern) what they thought about the program and they said that I would be wasting my summer and that program is a waste of time. But I don't know if I can pick up the information the same way they do (I got 1060 on my PSAT). I have to decide by tomorrow morning if I want to take that class or another one but I want to see some other opinions before blindly accepting.",

            "comment": "Prep programs are difficult because they often only teach rudimentary skills and they cannot focus on one student because they have to teach a whole class.\n\nIt depends if you know what is being tested on the sat. If you generally know the topics, I would spend the time doing practice tests/practice and review your own mistakes rather than learning things you already know at a prep class.",

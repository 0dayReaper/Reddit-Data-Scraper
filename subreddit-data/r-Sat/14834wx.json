    "postText": "Hey reddit! I am an Asian and a rising junior in highschool. I am thinking about taking my sat in August, October, and future months if my score doesn't meet my goal. However, I have a huge problem of being too scared to study in order to reach my goal of 1300+. My initial psat was 10th grade psat was 1070(530 - math, 540 - English) and I really need to improve it. The reason why I want to get it to at least 1300+ is because I want to get into a university like virgina tech or Penn State. If all doesn't work I would apply test optional but I don't want that to be the case because I am asian. My ec's and grades are fine(4.26 gpa). I just don't know why I am scared to study even when I know it's for my own benifit. I bought Mr.John Jung's sat math accelerator course to improve my math and I will think about something for English. Just please someone help me on my situation. I just can't stop thinking about this situation because it scares me to believe that if I do all this prep it won't stick in my mind. Is it just a lack of self-esteem? Planning on studying 4 hours a day in the summer and 1 hour a day during the school year because I have AP classes(Lang, Calc ab, micro/macro, and De physics). Also what is your opinion on reading books to improve my reading comprehension and mind concentration for the sat as I am terrible at comprehension and lack simple focus. Please help. Thank you so much and sorry if I wasted your time..\n\nI did the first sat reading passage from practice test 2 today and I am embarrassed to say I got like 3 correct\ud83e\udd72. That probably happened because my mind was just somewhere else. \n\nThe worst part is I cry/worry about the sat everyday because I love math and want to pursue a math major in college. Hence, I don't want the sat holding me back from these opportunities. My brother who goes to a t25(UVA) got a 1500+ sat score without studying(didn't even touch a textbook once). Am I not meant for these tests?",

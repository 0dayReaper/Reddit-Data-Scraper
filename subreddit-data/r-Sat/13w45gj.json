    "postText": "I\u2019m kind of anxious about the June 3rd SAT now because I just took a practice test and got a 1350. This will be my third time taking it now and my goal is a 1500+ but I haven\u2019t even reached that in any of my practice tests. On my second SAT, though, I did manage a 1450 even though I kept getting 1200-1300s in my practice tests. I\u2019ve been doing consistent studying (practice test every Saturday for past 5 months and workbooks) and I feel like my score is not improving at all despite major progress in actual skills. Has anyone had a similar situation?",

For some reason, I just do better with the stress and pressure, and it causes me to lock and problem solve better. In terms of score improvement, you might be practicing wrong. Make sure your reviewing your mistakes, and focusing on certain strategies for repetitive question types (like the writing \u201cwhere should this sentence go\u201d). The SAT is literally a test of how much you study, so keep going!",

My main weakness is in math but even my reading score fluctuates from 690-760. Do you recommend I do some more work and then take another practice test or just go with some lightweight studying? I've been studying the same exact way I had for my last SAT but my progress is going downward instead of upward",

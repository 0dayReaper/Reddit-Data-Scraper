            "comment": "As an AP calc student, the best way I understood the unit circle (a circle with a radius of 1) was memorizing these aspects\n\n1.\tHalf-way around a circle is 180 degrees or pi radians.\nThis is critical in knowing where angle is going to form without needing to convert. So pi/2 radians is just 90\u00b0, pi radians is 180\u00b0, and so on.\n\n2.\tSince the hyponeuse is 1, the [legs created](https://mathmonks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Unit-Circle-Equation.jpg) from angle theta will just equal cosine(X) for the adjacent leg (length), and sin(X) for the opposite leg (height).\nThis is because cos(\u00f8)= adjacent/hypotenuse, and since the hyponeuse is 1, it means X-coordinate IS cosine(\u00f8). \n\nSo the pi/2 radians, or 90\u00b0 around the circle means that the X-coordinate is cos(90\u00b0) = 0, and the y-coordinate is sin(90\u00b0) = 1, so the coordinate is (1,0).\n\n3.\tKnow the 30-60-90 formula, and the 45-45-90 formula.\nThis is a lot easier to mind when you realize these are the only triangles that you\u2018ll ever know the answer to without a calculator.\n\n45-45-90 follows the X:X:(x\\*sqrt(2)), and 30-60-90 follows X\u2014X\\*sqrt(3)\u20142X",

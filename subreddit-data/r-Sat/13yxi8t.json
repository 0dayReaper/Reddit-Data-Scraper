If you had a bunch of difficult questions on the second section, that means you did really well on the first section. Your score will be pretty high.\n\nThere is no way to predict what your actual score will be, though. That's the nature of an adaptive test. I hope you crushed it!",

The reason for this is the adaptive testing, the paper one was a mixed bag for everyone but the dsat becomes hard in module 2 if you do well in module 1 so it\u2019s for the smarter students",

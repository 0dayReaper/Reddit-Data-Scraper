    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard that any score in the 1550-1600 range is essentially the same to top colleges when they consider admissions, but is this true? Especially because 1-2 questions wrong in english in the new digital sat mean 20-30 points deducted EACH question, it would make sense that those scores are considered to be the same. Does anyone know if this is true? I got a 1550 but don\u2019t really want to take the SAT again bc of the new point system for the digital version. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Not exactly. I have friends in admissions at two T20 schools, and what I've learned is that an applicant with a 1600 does have an advantage over an applicant with a 1550. But it's a very small advantage, and the decision will usually come down to other factors. And in my experience as an SAT teacher, getting from 1550 to 1600 is hard, much harder than getting from a 1500 to a 1550. So, although a 1600 would be better, it probably isnt worth your effort to put in the time you'd need to get there. IMO that effort would be better spent developing your ECs, as that would probably have a much bigger impact on admissons",

I get every question correct but I have to sometimes guess on a vocab question. However with the digital sat that one vocab question was -30 points sadly",

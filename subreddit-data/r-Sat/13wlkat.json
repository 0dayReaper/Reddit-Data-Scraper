    "postText": "I\u2019m giving the June 3rd attempt (Digital SAT). I\u2019ve done all the practice papers on Bluebook and some others. I\u2019m getting good scores but I really don\u2019t wanna screw this up. Honestly I find Khan Academy useless but should I give it another go? I score well in Math but I *need* a 800 in Reading (770 is also fine), so any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

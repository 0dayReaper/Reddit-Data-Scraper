It makes it clear that the subject at hand is female, and because the sentence says \u201cEleanor\u2019s boyfriend\u201d, we can infer that the speaker is talking about Eleanor since there seems to be no other female provided in the sentence. Options A, C, and D would only work if there was additional context provided before the sentence such as \u201cDid you know that the brightest object in space is actually a moon?\u201d In that situation, we can easily identify the moon being the subject discussed at hand.",

                    "comment": "You're overthinking the possessive \"Eleanor's\" -- yes, it functions as an adjective, but it is still a noun.\n\nWhile possessives and attributive nouns (\"dog food\") act like adjectives, they are still nouns and not adjectives. The easy test is to add another adjective to them, as cumulative adjectives are interchangeable:\n\n* *Eleanor's handsome boyfriend*\n* *Handsome Eleanor's boyfriend* &lt;&lt; doesn't work\n\nAttributive nouns operate similarly:\n\n* *Yummy dog food*\n* *Dog yummy food &lt;*&lt; doesn't work\n\nNote that you could use a pronoun reference to \"dog\" in the noun phrase \"dog food,\" as in \n\n* *Dog food is always yummy for them.*\n   * with \"them\" referencing the attributive noun, \"dog.\"\n\nHere's another way to look at it: \n\nPossessives and attributive nouns operate in the genitive case, which indicates ownership or possession. So, \n\n* *Dog food* = *food for dogs*\n* *Eleanor's boyfriend* = *the boyfriend of Eleanor* \n\nYou can see, then how pronoun references are apporpriate for attributive and possessive nouns. \n\nHope that makes sense!",

Modifiers include:\n\n* adjectives (modify nouns)\n* adverbs (modify verbs)\n* determiners (modify nouns, such as \"that car\" or \"five boys\" etc.)\n* articles (*a, the)*\n* prepositions (modify nouns, verbs, or larger sentence parts)\n\nAdditionally, some other parts of speech and sentence parts can act as modifiers as well, including:\n\n* attributive and possessive nouns\n* participle phrases and relative clauses\n\nBut that's for another discussion...\n\nMeanwhile, do pay attention to verbs that may act as modifiers. We call these: \"**non-finite verbs**\".\n\nThey are:\n\n* **present &amp; past participle adjectives** and participle phrases they may create\n   * participle = verb form that acts as an adjective modifier, such as\n      * *A* ***developed*** *sense for grammar is helpful*\n      * ***Blooming*** *flowers are beautiful*\n* **infinitives**, which are the \"to\" form of a verb and that can act as a noun, adverb or adjective\n   * *I am happy* ***to learn*** *that she is feeling better*  &lt;&lt; adverb\n   * *A virtue* ***to learn*** *is patience*  &lt;&lt; adjective\n\nNote that non-finite participles and infinitives can also act as nouns:\n\n* gerunds, which are present participle forms of verbs that act as nouns (in the *-ing* form of a verb, which can also be a present participle adjective):\n   * ***Cooking*** *is fun*   (note: = gerunds are nouns, not modifiers)\n      * the way to tell if the present participle is a gerund or an adjective is to remove it and see if the sentence is still grammatically coherent\n      * *~~Cooking~~* *is fun* &lt;&lt; can't remove it, so \"cooking\" is a noun\n      * *The* *~~cooking~~* *time for brownies is 20 minutes* &lt;&lt; can remove  it, so \"cooking\" is an adjective\n* infinitive noun:\n   * *I want* ***to know***  &lt; object (noun, not a modifier)\n\nThere's a lot more to non-finite verbs that you may want to review. I have a worksheet on it here:  [https://school4schools.wiki/wiki/Non-finite\\_verbs\\_%26\\_the\\_%22verbiness%22\\_of\\_participles\\_gerunds\\_infinitives\\_worksheet](https://school4schools.wiki/wiki/Non-finite_verbs_%26_the_%22verbiness%22_of_participles_gerunds_infinitives_worksheet)\n\nAnother important modifier for the SAT is the **prepositional phrase**\n\n* prepositions create adjective or adverb modifiers that connect a noun (the \"object\" of the preposition) to another noun, verb, or sentence part in order to add information to it:\n   * *The experiment* ***by a team*** ***of scientists*** ***from Sweden*** ***last year*** *shows promise*\n      * &lt;&lt; the four prepositional phrases here modify , or add information to, \"experiment\"\n      * &lt;&lt; SAT will try to fool you into selecting the wrong subject-verb match with by confusion over the prepositional phrases\n\nNot sure if this is what you were looking for, but could be useful review, anyway.",

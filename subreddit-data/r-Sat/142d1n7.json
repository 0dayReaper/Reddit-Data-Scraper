    "postText": "I have registered for the SAT test on May 26 and paid an amount of 103$. Having paid the money using PayPal, I expected it to take 1 day or 2 but after that nothing happened and my payment which was being authorized simply vanished. I have tried contacting support but nothing changed (They said the payment which was on hold by my bank would be lifted after 3-5 business days which did not happen).\nIt has been more than 8 days, any ideas to how can I take my money back or change the current status on my registration? I don\u2019t want to spend twice the amount of money for 1 examination .",

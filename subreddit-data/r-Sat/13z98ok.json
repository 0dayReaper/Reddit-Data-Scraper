    "postText": "I was on the second module in math and as I was putting in numbers for desmos I somehow maybe put in a command clicking a few keys by accident and it minimized. I could see my desktop and everything. I didn\u2019t dare touch my desktop and after trying to get it back to normal I gave up and continued. I even called the proctor for help and reassurance and they said its fine as long as I can still take the test. My concern is if this will cancel my test.  It only re-maximized after I finished the exam and it said congratulations. Has anyone had this happened to them before? Has any scores been cancelled due to this?",

            "comment": "For me, I skip until the begging of the sentence where I\u2019m asked a grammar question. \n\nThen whenever you see blocked numbers or wtv (like [1] [2] [3] etc) I DO actually read it so I understand the context and sometimes I underline like 3 words so I can recall what the sentence/paragraph is talking about. Answer grammar questions as usual, that weird where does this fit? The underline helps\n\nMethod\nI seriously recommend doing grammar test, every time you get a question wrong, get paper, write the kind of question and why the correct answer is correct. Then also note what the other choice would NEED in order to be correct. \n\nThe method above is the best I think. You learn both the correct answer AS WELL AS how to make the others correct. So if you are given a future question, you\u2019re more likely to have interacted with the answer choice and understand how it can be right/wrong. \n\nI recommend using khan academy and like 3 practice tests or so",

One thing that helped me besides just learning the basic concepts is skipping all of the reading and taking the questions individually. Helped me save a lot of time and think more carefully about the question.",

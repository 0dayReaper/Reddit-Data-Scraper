I haven\u2019t studied up until this week and hasn\u2019t been the best studying either. I\u2019m a senior next year and not sure if I should take it tomorrow just incase somehow I get a good score of if I should reschedule for August. On the Psat I got a 950 from not trying so i\u2019m not quite sure",

    "postText": "Today was my first SAT so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but our proctor only completed the four graded sections of the test, skipping the entire section 5, even though we had it in our test books. At the time, I didn\u2019t think about it and assumed some testing centers must be selected to do those instead. \n\nTurns out that was wrong. I\u2019m thinking of filling out a violation report on the college board website (although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s necessarily a \u201cviolation\u201d). \n\nHas anyone else had this experience or any advice on what steps to take? It\u2019d be devastating to get scores cancelled over something so simple. According to the College Board, they may use the answers on section 5 to evaluate if a student may be cheating based on his or her performance compared to other sections, and if we didn\u2019t answer any\u2026",

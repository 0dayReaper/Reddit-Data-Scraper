Especially in that first year or two, my dad told me he\u2019d get me something (I don\u2019t even remember what anymore xD) if I got to 200k points. I just did all that content up to 6th grade so that got me a fairly good start. \n\nEven last year, I used Khan Academy for AP Stats, Chem and Physics 1 *a lot*, that usage really brought me up quite a bit. 200k is great! Keep grinding my friend :))",

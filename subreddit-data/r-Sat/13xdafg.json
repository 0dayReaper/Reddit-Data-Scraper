You're rarely going to have two groups of questions with exactly identical statistics, so when you put groups of questions together into a test, you might see slight differences in overall test difficulty. To ensure that the scaled scores (the scores out of 800) mean the same thing from test to test, you have to equate the tests, which means you can have slightly different conversions of raw scores (the number correct) to scaled scores from test to test.\n\nIt looks like you're talking about the digital test. The situation is more complicated there because of the adaptive nature of the test. You can't think about it like '# right = x score\"; instead, the score reflects the particular combination of questions you answered correctly/incorrectly.",

It\u2019s not a curve, which would mean it depends on how students perform on test day.  It\u2019s a raw score conversion determined by an equating process, which pre-tests the difficulty of the questions . It ensures the same performance results in the same score, regardless of the difficulty of the test.\n\nIt\u2019s fair because that\u2019s what a standardized test is supposed to be. Would you prefer your score to depend on the random difficulty of your specific test on test day?\n\nThe range of some older paper test score conversions can be seen at [https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/](https://thecollegepanda.com/past-sat-curves/)\n\nDigital tests are a bit more complicated, but the concept Is the same.\n\nThe equating process is defined at [https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/sat-scoring-equating.pdf](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/sat-scoring-equating.pdf)",

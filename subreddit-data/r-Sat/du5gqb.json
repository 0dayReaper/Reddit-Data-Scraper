So maybe try aiming around there. \n\nAlso make sure your essays are good, you have good ECs etc.\n\nAlso it depends on what major you\u2019re shooting for. Like I\u2019m applying to English (don\u2019t roast me LMAO) and that\u2019s not as competitive as say, engineering or business.\n\nAnd also maybe try demonstrating interest, maybe scheduling a visit to the campus?\n\nGood luck, I hope to see you there!",

It's true when they say you need more than an SAT score.  My brother got a 2400 and ended up at community college because he applied to 5 really competitive schools, and got rejected a 3 and wait listed then rejected at 2.  Don't sweat if your score isn't good, just be amazing outside of school.  That's what matters, really.",

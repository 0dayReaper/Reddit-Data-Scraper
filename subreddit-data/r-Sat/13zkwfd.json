This time I prepped really well and gave my best . My scores were delayed. Now they are cancelled. What should I do now. Please I just feel like crying \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Reply asap guys.",

I received an email about reviewing my scores on the score releasing day. Now they say I cheated I know I might have jumped hundreds of points up. But just because of this they can't accuse me of cheating. I did around 7000 questions. Only I know the pain of prep I had gone through. They simply accused me of cheating. I have financial constraint of taking the SAT. I am taking the SAT using scholarship only .",

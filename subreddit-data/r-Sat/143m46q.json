I guess i can do it if i want to but the thing is i have no idea should I actually appear for it rn? Will I be able to do it in these 2 months?\nWhat do u say? Can u learn from scratch to a 1500 score in 2 months.",

You should probably take a practice DSAT before you consider signing up for it.\n\nYou can download the BlueBook app once you have created a CollegeBoard account. The BlueBook app has 4 practice tests available.",

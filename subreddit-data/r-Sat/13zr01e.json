I have the college board book, college panda math and writing book. I am taking my next SAT in August and will use the whole summer to study. Any tips you can give me helps. Thanks.",

My recommendation is just to practice speed reading honestly, it\u2019s a useful skill generally and will help you get through the section much more comfortably. Other than that, practice reading articles similar to those you take the most time on, history or science for example. Then, ask yourself questions about the article after you finish it, basic stuff but along the lines of SAT questions. \n\n\u201cHow could I summarize this?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it\u2019s structure?\u201d\n\nThis will show you what to look out for as you read the actual test, while not being a totally miserable activity generally.",

Crack the code and have fun with it. Challenge yourself and review your mistakes ruthlessly without becoming ashamed for making them, because they're all part of the process.\n\nFind your weak points and review them.\n\nIt's not too hard to learn all you need to know for the punctuation on the writing section, so perfect that and get some \"free\" points.",

To improve my reading, I used Erica Meltzer for a week and my score went up 70 points. \n\nDecember I got a perfect score in grammar which I accredit to reading a lot, so READ. \n\nMath has always been my strong suit, but after doing EM prep, my reading has always scored higher. To improve math, all there is to do is practice. I suggest memorizing formulas and watching math SAT walkthroughs on YouTube.\n\nDon't burn yourself out trying to finish all of the books you've bought. Finishing more does not necessarily mean you'll do better; understanding what you've done wrong and how to fix it does.\n\nBest of luck! You got this.",

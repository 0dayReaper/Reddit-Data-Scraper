(~1 min)\n\nI then mark out the sections in the passage for the evidence questions with a different symbol for different questions. The symbol on each marked section matches the symbol I create for the specific question. (~1 min)\n\nI then start reading the full passage. I read each paragraph quickly, but also carefully. After each paragraph I ask myself: \u201cwhat was the purpose of this paragraph? What did it teach me?\u201d This way, the information is absorbed much better and I get a much better grasp on the passage. (~3 mins)\n\nI then answer the questions. With good comprehension, I don\u2019t really have to go back into the passage, other than the evidence and definition questions. (~7-8 mins)\n\nReading quickly is a necessary skill, I sometimes follow along where I\u2019m reading with my pencil to help me keep track of where I am. However, you should not compromise comprehension for speed. If you cannot read quickly and keep a good level of understanding, you should practice more.\n\nAlso you should bubble one page or one section at a time, rather than bubbling each question at a time. If you bubble each question right after doing it, it is easier to lose your focus.\n\nAlso consider the order of the passages you do. Maybe start off with the most boring one, or the easiest one for you.\n\nYou should always be aware of the time you have, and budget time for each passage on the reading section. I usually just do 13 mins for each passage, and if I go faster on the easier passages, I will have more time for the harder passages.",

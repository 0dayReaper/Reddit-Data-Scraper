            "comment": "I find that much of the struggle when it comes to these questions stems from **not knowing where to start**. That's why it's always crucial to determine what variable to be solved so to avoid being left with \"So what?\" after reading the problem. The process involves mainly cross multiplication to solve for the missing variable in the given rate.\n\nIt's a simple concept but the way the question is phrased makes it harder.\n\nHere's how I approached it reading-wise\n\n\"Seo-Yun knows that she mixes 105 gallons of water with bleach per year..\"\n\nNotice how the amount of water was given but bleach isn't.\n\nAlthough the sentence seems straightforward, you could easily misinterpret that 105 gallons refer to the mixture of **both** water and bleach- it isn't, it's only water.\n\nSo in truth, the sentence is actually\n\"Seo-Yun knows that she mixes 105 gallons of water with X bleach per year..\"\n\nWe were told beforehand the 1/16 teaspoon of bleach = 1 cup of water\n\nPersonally, I converted the 105 gallons of water to 1680 cups first since we already know how much teaspoon of bleach is in one cup.\n\nThen multiply the amount of teaspoon of bleach required for 1 cup of water to the 1680 cups of water, because we have 1680 cups\n\nThe product, 105, represents the amount of teaspoon of bleach for 1680 cups of water- but we aren't done. We're asked what's left if she had half a gallon of bleach at the start of the year.\n\nConvert half a gallon to teaspoon by dividing the given gallon to teaspoon conversion by two and subtract them\n\n279",

But college board should write the email better than saying \u201cyou cheated\u201d and instead say the algorithm flagged it for potential cheating and so to protect the integrity of the test for everyone they\u2019re requiring a retake. Idk but it would suck to get canceled when you didn\u2019t cheat.",

This was unheard of just 10-15 years ago, but now everyone is in a rat race for college admissions.\n\nThe SAT/ACT should matter, as it shows aptitude and ability. And it would help kids to, well, be kids: to enjoy their summers and read books for fun and not stress out so much that they have to spend every waking hour of their high school years min-maxxing for college admissions.\n\nI also believe that the US should, as in other countries, nudge those with low standardized test scores to consider blue collar professions. High schools should have programs for such students that helps them to learn plumbing, roofing, electrical work, carpentry, etc etc. Right now we are really failing students in this regard.",

This is good for students who are motivated and know what they wanna do.\n\nThe United States is good for those who are more undecided, who want to take classes in undergrad unrelated to their major to gain a more broader knowledge base. Neither system is better than the other, it simply comes down to the type of student you are!",

In my state, we have about 21 vocational schools total for students to attend. Similarly to dual enrollment we spend half the day there and half the day at normal school. I'm currently in a program to receive certification to become a Certified Clinical Medical Assistant. Every program leads to a real world job. The only problem is that they're not very well known, even amongst the people at my normal school. I still have to explain what it is from time to time. Relatively new, but I'm sure it will be well known and a well established path of schooling some day.",

I can got to a small high school in a run down part of town where they don\u2019t do well academically and easily get a 4.5 gpa but a super low SAT score bc the school isn\u2019t actually preparing for college, or I can go to a super prestigious private school and get a 3.8 gpa and high SAT. In that case the first would look the best on there application bc of their gpa, bc you wouldn\u2019t see scores but obviously the college prep prestigious highschool with the lower gpa is more prepared for college and had harder classes and harder teachers. \n\nA student who goes to an easy school where all the teachers don\u2019t care too much about your future at college and just give out As with no effort don\u2019t deserve to get a spot in college over a kid who tries super hard because they go to much harder school where everyone is not easy and they have to put in work even to get a lower gpa deserves it.\n\n^^this is where ACT/SAT comes in. Without it, there is no neutralizer for the different school systems and types of teachers.\n\nYou can even think about more basic unfair differences that would advocate for standardized testing such as different letter grades for different point scales. At some scales an A is a 90+, others it\u2019s a 93+, others it make be 87+\u2026 my point is that no part of the admissions process is nearly as fair as the ACT test.",

Then I went to Berkeley for undergrad and realized that I was actually quite unprepared for the rigor compared to my classmates who grew up in the Bay Area. They had worse grades than me in high school because their high school was more rigorous, but they had better grades than me in college because their rigorous high school prepared them well for a rigorous college curriculum.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to an low-tier med school because of my mediocre grades in undergrad, while my Bay Area friends who did well at Berkeley are going to really good med schools. That is to say, it\u2019s better to prep kids earlier for a more rigorous curriculum. But only to a certain extent\u2026it\u2019s also good to let children be children and play outside!",

If you want to talk about fairness, let\u2019s talk about the kids who are horrible STANDARDIZED test takers. Does that mean they\u2019re unprepared for college? Even though this student might already be enrolled in, let\u2019s say, college courses taught at a local university. \n\nStandardized tests will NEVER bridge the gap between the context of two students. There\u2019s too many different types of people who are all ready for college in their own ways. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think someone getting a 1600 even shows that they can write an analytical essay. Or speak well. Have good social skills. Will contribute to society meaningfully beyond having the ability to study for an exam with skills learned in middle school. Bc let\u2019s be real here, being able to do algebra 1 math is not an indicator of college readiness. It shows you have the time and dedication to prepare for an exam, sure. But sweetie, some of us have real life going on. I get wanting to require test scores, but even in that event, a low score shouldn\u2019t be seen as the end all be all. JUST like how an imperfect GPA shouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. \n\nThat\u2019s my take, I\u2019m not coming for u, I\u2019m just tired of people thinking good test scores indicate college readiness when every single metric has shown test scores correlate with very specific backgrounds",

Additionally, very very few students suffer from crippling, unmanageable anxiety that impacts their test performance but not their performance in other aspects of life.\n\n2. Elite test-prep programs do not help much. Like 50-100 points. And it is not much more effective than free alternatives. Furthermore, most of the prep is studying the material - and knowing the material is the point of the test.\n\nAnd children of wealthier parents will be more knowledgeable and better prepared for their careers because their parents have more resources. They are simply better candidates. The SAT just reveals that.",

Collegeboard has been continuing to make the test more fair and practical with the DSAT (no more going back to sections, more important math skills, and comprehending texts online is an important skill to have now, obscenely rare CB W), and now anyone with a computer has access to free test prep resources and online textbooks. It sucks that it costs money, but maybe people can speak to the fee waivers being useful.\n\nThe people who pay for the best tutors can do that stuff anyways with college counselors, and their ineptitude will most likely reveal itself in another part of their application. If it was really about socio-economic status, then legacy admissions would be a thing of the past. I mean, seriously, how can colleges be out here promoting diversity when they consider legacy status \ud83d\ude2dthey are literally just keeping this shit as an excuse to get more applicants so they get more application fee money and \u2728more applicants = lower acceptance rate = prestige\u2728\n\nThis also gives people who had problems during their high school year like a severe injury or depression another chance to prove themself, which I think is really important. \n\nFinally, with AI improving at writing and analysis and worsening the problem of grade inflation, the SAT will become more important to measure your own ability imo. I think that bringing back the essay might not be a bad idea for this reason too, although another section would have to be shortened so the test doesn't take too long.",

I did and got a 1520. The thing is, though, is that for people at bad schools and/or who have uninformed parents, like me, there is ZERO emphasis on the SAT. People like vaguely mention it\u2019s good for college, and that\u2019s it. I thought it was just another standardized test. Without Reddit, I would\u2019ve just seen the \u201c95th percentile\u201d on my 1380 and called it a mf day, thinking that was good enough. Had no clue the SAT scene was as competitive as it is. People from bad schools literally have no clue of the importance of the SAT to know to study up in the first place\u2026 that\u2019s where the unfairness lies.\n\nAlso, on the whole \u201cwealth manipulates every other part of the app, too!\u201d Not so much. Every student knows to get As, that\u2019s like something you learn day 1 of kindergarten. As for ECs, ideally, ppl are applying sideways anyways \ud83d\ude44but even if they\u2019re not, colleges typically expect less from FG/LI students to begin with in terms of epicballerpoggers3000 ECs; debate captain, class officer president, or quiz bowl captain are typically in the realm of \u201cgood enough\u201d because that\u2019s all they have access to. \n\nThe SAT, IMO, is fair as a test itself in terms of content. Duh. The way it can be gamed by those in-the-know and those with tiger parents is patently unfair. I\u2019ve seen stupider kids have much better scores than smart kids literally just because the stupider kid had a rich mommy to pay for personal tutoring \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44it sucks to watch in action.

            "comment": "THIS. Even if SAT ACTs are required, they're just a *part* of the college admissions process, just like your GPA, letter of rec, essays, etc.. There are so many factors that colleges take into account, and those with different backgrounds shouldn't argue so much about \"not having enough opportunities to study for the SAT/ACT\" because colleges take everything into account. \n\nThere is a difference between person A with a 1600 SAT and person B with a 1200 SAT when they have almost the same background, but going test optional basically puts person A and B on the same level, or person A just very slightly above person B. The AOs very well may accept person B and not person A because of some other small tipping factor, which isn't that fair IMO.\n\nThese standardized tests can be taken multiple times, so there's no reason for \"I took the test on a bad day so that's why I failed\". Other countries (some Asian countries especially) have very strict college entrance exams, and if you do bad on that one, your college dream goes crushed (or you try again next year). The US's admissions process is nice enough to give you lots of chances. The SAT and ACTs are just fine.",

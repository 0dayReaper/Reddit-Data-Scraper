    "postText": "Hi!\n\n   The reading section of the SAT has always been my worst section. I have practiced a lot through Khan Academy, but haven't managed to improve this part much. I always get anywhere from 38-42 questions right when I take practice tests. However, by practicing my math skills, I got my score from a projected 1250 or so to a 1410. I went into my first test confident that I would score above 1400. \n\n   When I began the test, though, I flipped back and forth between the questions and passages and forgot what I just read every time I turned the page. I would see the question, read a section of the passage, turn back to answer it, and then blank out. I couldn't focus no matter how hard I tried. Strangely enough, on the grammar section, the widely spaced text helped me to focus through the passages. I got a 42/44 on the grammar, but a 34/52 on the reading. This cost me the 60 points I needed to get to a 1400 (1340 total). \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to focus through the reading passages? Thank you! :)",

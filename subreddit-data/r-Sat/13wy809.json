When you accomplish something it doesn't matter if you were smart or anything else, because in the end, you did it. Maybe it was because of your intelligence, maybe not. You just waste your time online posting about this stuff. Do something actually useful rather than being insecure about your intelligence online because you will regret how much time you devoted to this when you could actually be useful.  Also, SAT isn't the place for this stuff, if you actually think you are gifted, go solve some AIME problems. Sat math is nothing compared to many other college entrance exams or olympiads.",

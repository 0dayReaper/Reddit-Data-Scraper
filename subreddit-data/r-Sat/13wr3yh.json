    "postText": "So, the June SAT is in 3 days.... I  don't know who needs to hear this, but the SAT in no way shape or form represents your intelligence and SHOULD NOT dictate your self worth. Whether if you are aiming for a 1000 or even trying to break 1500, you are valid. You already took a huge step in trying to advance your college admissions process by even signing up and you should be proud of yourself! Even if you didn't study for the June SAT who cares. There's always the one in August. If you don't get the score you want, dust yourself off and try again you got this! The SAT isn't about how smart you are, but about discipline. Create a routine and stick with it and I promise you, you will get the result that you are looking for. \"Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work. \" You  have the ability to get a great score, you just have to put in the work. Use these next three days to prepare and just breathe. Instead of dreading the days until the SAT, count them down proudly, because you have come far. One of the worst things you could do for the SAT is panic. Be calm and just think. Be strategic and don't second guess yourself; go with your instinct.Keep breathing and you got this I believe in you! Good luck everyone!",

It's important to have a calm mind before the SAT.",

Some people are very intelligent but are bad test takers. When I was in college, no matter how well I knew the subject, I almost always tested poorly on it. I could give a presentation, do a project, write a paper, answer questions, etc.. I am not a good test taker. \n\nMy kids have been homeschooled since 5th grade. They both finished their AA with a 4.0 unweighted before they even should have graduated high school. They both did just fine on the SAT but a lot of kids in their position would not have simply because they were not conditioned to sit and take tests for 5 hours at a time. \n\nOne last point, I taught at a private school years ago. Sometimes, the kids I knew were intelligent did poorly in the SATs. Maybe their parents told them they were getting divorced the previous evening. Maybe they didn\u2019t have breakfast. Maybe they good a poor night of sleep. So no, one test on one day is not an accurate measure of intelligence and these tests honestly should not hold the kind of weight that they do.",

They expose kids who don't read well and who don't think well. They are strongly correlated with intelligence, especially at the higher ends of the scale where the questions are not merely mechanical.\n\nI do agree with you that the SAT should not be the sole determinant for college admissions. But neither should your willingness to shutter yourself in a room to study for 4 hours per day to get good grades.\n\nWithout the SAT and ACT to fill in for an IQ test, getting in to college would be entirely a function of effort, wealth, and physical attributes. That's a great way to ruin kids' youth. The SAT takes pressure off of kids to get straight As and to beg their friend's surgeon father for fake summer internships.",

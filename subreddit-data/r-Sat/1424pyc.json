However I know that most colleges begin opening applications at that time so would that be a smart thing to do? I was trying to do early admission but I don\u2019t know if I can even do that now if I don\u2019t have the SAT scores I want to send in along with the application.",

The earliest application deadline I\u2019ve seen is October 15. Most are November 1 for Early rounds and January 1 (or later) for Regular rounds.\n\nTesting is typically fine through at least October (Early) or December (Regular).\n\nAs always, check with each school for specific dates.",

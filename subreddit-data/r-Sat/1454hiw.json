You could potentially even take the DSAT on a compatible device without a front-facing camera (if those exist anymore)\n\nYour proctors are always watching. and potentially even taking notes / making reports \u2014but there is no video capability on Bluebook, and AFAIK no video taken in the testing room itself.\n\nI think they are less worried about cheating because of the adaptive nature of the test. Students are still seeing a lot of the same questions, but in different orders to make cheating harder.",

    "postText": "I got the college panda book due to it being highly recommended by this subreddit but I am really not getting anywhere with it as I can't grasp the concepts that well. I got past the first chapter and I got it well... up until the chapter review practice problems. Completely threw me off guard and I feel like I have absolutely no idea what I am doing and the \"explanations\" in the key made little to no sense to me.  \n\n\nThis is not to blame the book at all as many of my friends are doing just fine with it, I'm just not as refreshed on concepts as I thought I was and I'm having trouble grasping them.  \n\n\nHow can I learn to grasp these concepts? Will Khan Academy be enough?  \n\n\nAnd is there any udemy courses or anything of that sort that teach  sat math well?",

As a matter of fact I haven\u2019t even grasped the FIRST concept of it even after several hours of trying countless practice problems, even after looking at the explanations.",

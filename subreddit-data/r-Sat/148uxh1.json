Also I have no idea what resources to use. So if y\u2019all could give me a heads up if it\u2019s possible or not and some advice on good resources for studying and maybe a study schedule that be nice.",

            "comment": "If you are capable of doing so, you probably don't need that much time.\n\nA 400 point increase probably dosen't happen for most, but with 1+ year to prep, that's definitely possible. Although very rare, I've seen people do that in a shorter time span. \n\nYou will be taking the digital SAT then and there aren't too many resources that directly pertain to it. I'm pretty sure Erica meltzer released books already that are tailored for the digital and khan also has a digital section. But by the time it comes for your test, a lot more resources will be released.",

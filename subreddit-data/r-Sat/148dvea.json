Your math subscore is obviously enough for every school, but for HYPSM, definitely trying improving EBRW. I suggest reading some common American scholarly media outlets such as the New York Times (or a free equivalent). English is harder to study for, but the best part is you just have to remember that the answer is always ENTIRELY found in the text, and you don\u2019t have to study as narrowly, although that can feel directionless at times.\n\nAs for scholarships, again, it all depends on which one. But for int students, a 1500+ will definitely open a lot more doors.",

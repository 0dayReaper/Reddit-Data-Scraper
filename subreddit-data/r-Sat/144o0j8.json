    "postText": "Hello guys, I took a practice SAT on khanacademy today to begin preparing for the august sat (paper). I Got 750 M/750 english. I am not sure what the best materials are to look at to begin reviewing. I knew all the concepts on the math and english ones I got wrong but misread the problems :(. I find on some of the english ones I get them wrong because I overthink and somehow rationalize the wrong one even though the right one is more clear. I think reading will be the hardest for me to improve because there is not set \"formula\".\n\nWhat are  the best books/online resources for hard problems to practice (so I can lower the amount of silly mistakes). I looked at the Khan problems but a lot of them are lower level ones.\n\nThanks!",

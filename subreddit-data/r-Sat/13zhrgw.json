    "postText": "I just took the khan academy SAT practice test 10, and I scored significantly higher than practice test 1 and 2. Practice test 1 was my first SAT I\u2019d ever taken and I took practice test 2 shortly after. I got a 1230 on 1, a 1220 on 2, and I just got a 1350 on 10. Is this accurate. Is the math easier on practice test 10? I studied a little bit in-between test 2 and test 10.",

    "postText": "Just checked to sign up for the SAT in Idaho, and up until December 7th, the only location (period, there is only one within 100 miles for most dates; 50-75 for October and November, 50 for August) is in another state. It's not even that I missed the deadline, it's that there is only one location offering it. Will more test dates open up in the future cause I seriously don't want to drive to Oregon to take the SAT?",

Pretty much all of these drives involve going through extensive mountain terrain in peak snow season, and in December, we finally have one a decent distance away (in Boise). To add fuel to the fire my testing date on June third (in a close location) was cancelled after i studied for it exhaustively. So I\u2019m a bit irked about the fact that there is not one single location close to the only area where there is a concentration of people in Idaho.",

It\u2019s probably that schools haven\u2019t yet confirmed with CB what dates they\u2019ll offer the test on. \n\nKeep checking. I\u2019d venture to guess that more test centers get added for your state in the coming months.",

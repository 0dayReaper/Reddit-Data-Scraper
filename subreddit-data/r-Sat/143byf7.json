            "comment": "The digital sat is significantly shorter than the paper sat.\n\nReading and writing are combined into one section with 54 questions compared to the SAT, which has 52 reading questions and 44 writing questions. The digital SAT has 44 math questions, calculator allowed on all with 33 multiple choice and 11 student produced responses. In contrast, the SAT math has 15 multiple choice and 5 student produced responses without a calculator and 30 multiple choice with 8 student produced responses with a calculator.\n\nThe most important change, however, is that the digital SAT changes based on how you answered the previous questions.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019d still reccomend taking the digital sat over the physical (if possible) since the passages are succinct compared to the paper version, which means that you\u2019re less inclined to get reading fatigue.\n\nThe kicker is that the test actively fights back against your skills until you crumble, but that\u2019s a much better alternative compared to gassing out in the last stretch of the R&amp;W. Plus the integrated Desmos graphing calculator can make some questions piss easy, especially if you know the ins and outs of Desmos.",

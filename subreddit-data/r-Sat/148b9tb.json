I remember Khan having some harder questions. If I were u, I would do the past qas paper exams (the questions are pretty much the same anyway). The digital sat might have 1-2 harder and unconventional questions at the end of module 2 but don\u2019t be too fixated on those (as u can still get an 800 without doing those).",

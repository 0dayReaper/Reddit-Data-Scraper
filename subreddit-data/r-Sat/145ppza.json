    "postText": "Hello, I'm taking the SAT in 3 months, and I scored a 1170 (550 EBRW and 620 Math) on my practice today. I'm trying to get above a 1400 on my first attempt, and but I'll keep redoing it until I get a better score. I'm going to start focusing on the SAT now that I have a bit more freetime. I'm going to put around 3-5 hours a day using Erica Meltzer's Grammar Book and the College Panda book (I'm also going to be printing out full tests) . I feel really good about math, and I know that I can definitely score a 700+. Grammar isn't that bad either; however, my English section was awful today. I would really appreciate it if someone answered my questions below. Today was my first time actually taking practice SAT, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\n1. How do I improve my reading score? I'm not an avid reader, but I can start if I really need to. If I do need to read, what do I read? Meltzer's reading book good enough (haven't placed an order yet on amazon)? I also sucked at keeping track of time, and basically guessed on a whole passage and a half at the end. \n2. How much could I realistically improve? I would be absolutely ecstatic w/ a 1400+, but a 200+ improvement is a lot. I think I can do it tho.\n3. Do you guys have any tips for not zoning out. I think I might have fell asleep partway through my 3rd section (no calc). I think coffee/caffeine might help, but I've never tried it before (my mom doesn't want me to even tho she drinks it every day lol). \n4. How often should I take practice test? I was thinking about 1 in every 2 weeks. That way I had plenty of time to really review my gaps.\n\nIdk if I'm overthinking this whole process but any help wold be really appreciated. I don't have a problem with staying disciplined, but I just need a place to start. Also I literally just showed up and took this practice test for free at a tutoring place. I haven't even received the math and grammar book from amazon yet.\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "1. To improve your reading score, start reading books. Books that you enjoy. They don\u2019t have to be super advanced and difficult to comprehend, but they should be at an age-appropriate level. I would recommend watching a Youtube video on general reading section tips as well. The only resource that I used was Khan Academy. Regarding timing, I\u2019m not sure if this is the best way to go about it, but I personally go as fast as I can (reading the entire passage and then moving on to the questions), marking the questions that I am unsure on and coming back at the end. \n\n2. The amount you improve is proportional to the effort you put in. I studied around an hour a day for two months on Khan Academy and got my score from a 1360 to a 1550. \n\n3. Lmao I doze off during the reading section, so what I do is scare myself by saying that if I don\u2019t focus, I\u2019m throwing away my future (this is 100% not true, but being scared keeps me awake). I wouldn\u2019t recommend caffeine as it might make you jittery. \n\n4. I would recommend taking a practice test every week if you have the time. Take a break for 30 min. after the test, and then score it and fully go through and check your answers. \n\nI hope this helps :) My biggest tip is to make use of Khan Academy! If you can afford it, look into getting a tutor (not trying to advertise, but maybe it\u2019s worth mentioning that I offer tutoring for $20/hr?).",

For the science passages, read in terms of paragraphs, don\u2019t waste too much time understanding exactly what\u2019s going on. Make sure you understand the argument of the author. For history, again, read for enjoyment and understand the argument. If one question is too hard, eliminate and move on DONT waste too much time on one.",

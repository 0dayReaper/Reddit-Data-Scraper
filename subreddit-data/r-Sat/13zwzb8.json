    "postText": "What did I learn from the June 2023 SAT:\n\n\\-I need to replicate better testing conditions.\n\n\\-I need to work on reading the questions more carefully\n\n\\-I need to do reading sections more for god sake\n\n\\-I need to stop overstressing when it comes to studying (Reduce studying from 5-6 hours a day of mindlessly doing questions to 3 hours a day where I actually understand the question and I am able to gain knowledge.)\n\n\\-I need to fix my sleep schedule\n\n\\-I need to stop stressing (Find a way to put my mind at ease)\n\n\\-The day before the big day, I should not touch sat material\n\n\\-I need to stop making dumb decisions for the math section aka if the question seems too straightforward then i might be doing it wrong. \n\nI got a 1340 first try and while I was initially expecting a 1400-1450 for this sat, I was wrong. I truly believe I will be getting 1300-1350. I made a ton of careless mistakes that cost me points. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFROM TOMMOROW (Taking a break today) I WILL IMPLEMENT NEW STRATEGIES FOR A MORE EFFICIENT STUDYING ROUTINE!",

I just did college boats practice tests and I have a prep course from which we worked ober problems and I went over my mistakes p much. I think it helped for reading and writing but I sold math so bad and got 6 wrong at least lmao idk how to stop making tiny errors like the Tory ounces question and then putting 30 percent instead of 70 for that other question cause I had the right answer but I started overthinking and changed it from 70 to 30 \ud83d\udc80",

I had been grinding uworld math problems on the areas where I felt like I was lacking and I actually started improving. The only thing, though, is that I expected June 3rd SAT to be somewhat like my practice, I was soo wrong \ud83d\ude2d so many questions I\u2019ve never seen before. Still, predicting a 730+ on math though",

Again, as a mom, I love my kid no matter what he gets. I know he put in the time and I know it's a stressful environment no matter how many times I tell him not to worry about it. He got a 1440 on his last test in May and I think that's fantastic. We both decided he should take it again and focus on a few things to see if he can squeak over a 1500. From his reaction yesterday, I don't know that it's likely he will score over a 1500 or not. It doesn't matter. Everyone finds there way in life and everyone's path to get there is different. It doesn't define you. If you're satisfied with the amount of work you put into preparing, than your score is what it is and it won't alter your life.",

With either the SAT or ACT there is going to be a point where you plateau and your score won't increase if you don't change up your study method or switch to a new tutor (I hear how elitist that sounds). We changed my son's tutor from test 1 to test 2. Both tutors were great but each had different strengths and different tactics. Khan Academy is linked with College Board so it's definitely a resource you should try if you're not already and it's free. There are actually some great TikToks content makers that I follow and make notes from for my son. Finally, there are some books out there highly rated on Amazon that speak more about tactic than content that may be helpful. I believe the basics for success are just taking as many practice tests as you can. There are many more practice tests available for free online than you'll find on the College Board website if you do a google search. Keep a notebook next to you when grading your tests and keep track of all of your error questions to study as well. That's about all I have for you.",

I would write down on a piece of paper what exactly the question was asking, the specific text evidence to support it, and if I got it wrong, I would write down what I was thinking which led me to the wrong answer, and why it was wrong. Drilling those points into my mind allowed me to see the pattern of the SAT and what I should focus on while reading the SAT. During the passages now, I could read the start of a sentence and be able to tell if its going to be important in answering the question or not. SAT is an iq test in a way. Tests pattern recognition ability since the entire test is a pattern. Find them, and the EVBRW section is easy",

I scored a 1330 my first go and hoped for a 1450ish like u did but I also made a few careless mistakes making me think I also didn\u2019t do well. I also need to work on all those things u mentioned I will be saving this to my screenshots so that I can reference cause u just defined pretty much all of my issues in testing lmao. Thank you good sir.",

            "comment": "I did all of this for June... Yet, I don't think that score will be any higher than 1400. Reading was terrible. I honestly think that memorizing words for vocab is just real waste of golden time. On test day, there obviously be a word whose meaning you don't know and won't probably need. I mean to do vocabulary, you need to:  \n1) Check if context requires positive or negative word.  \n2) Try to attack word by its prefix and suffix, predict its positivity/negativity by prefix/suffix.  \n3) Select the most harmonious one.",

            "comment": "For the math section, I\u2019d really recommend learning the concepts! Being able to identify each concept and actually knowing how to do them can drastically reduce the time you are taking on each question. For me, it was really the geometry that messed me up on my previous sat so I watched John Jung\u2019s math concepts [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJEsnzUGdlBOeK1ClXZT3dGztgxqLXi61) on youtube. \n\nI\u2019d recommend doing this instead of just trying to do more and more practice questions. \n\nFor the reading, I\u2019d recommend actually taking the time to read each passage thoroughly and answer the questions after, only referring back to the passage of necessary or for words in context. Here is another [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k1VOUvAjUDo) I found helpful \n\nHere is a summary of the tips that I found in the comments: \n\n\u201cFor cramming peeps.\n1. Spend more time reading passages than answering questions\n2. Only refer back to passage if absolutely necessary\n3. For \"Which line best supports __\", think about when you saw the evidence in the text and search there. Don't go through each choice unless you need to\n4. Do not choose primary definition answers (main definition of words)\n5. \"Eat\" the science and history passages. Bring butter. Legitimately, you must read these sections carefully for details.\n6. Cross out extraneous answers (unless evidence questions); it will keep you from overthinking your\nanswers\u201d \n\nFor reading, I would actually recommend doing more and more qas \n\nHope this helps!",

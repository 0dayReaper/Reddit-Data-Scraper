Then wait a few months (this is essential) do a shit ton of Khan academy questions and finally improve by 100 on math, and 100 in reading. Once you\u2019ve done all that your dad will ask you to study more because a 1300 is not good enough. So you keep trying to get better but eventually get mental breakdowns. You take a break for a while but once he realizes that you\u2019re not studying he will force you to. \n\nOh, and then right click for the \u201cinspect element\u201d option and change the math value!! Good luck!",

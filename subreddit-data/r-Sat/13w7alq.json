I scored 1410 on Practice test 3, and 1500 on practice test 7 within a span of two days, so try taking another test to see where you are really at. \n\nFinally, for some tips, on grammar memorize the prep scholar list of grammar rules since there is probably not enough time to do the whole erica Meltzer book (you can try though).",

Tomorrow wake up, do another practice test, review mistakes and practice in the different sub sections to improve. If u have extra time, during the test mark the questions ur not sure of.",

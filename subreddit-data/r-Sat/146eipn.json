With a score as low as 410, your priority should be starting from square one and relearning all of the basics, slowly working through each concept that will appear on the test. To me, Khan Academy seems more like a practicing resource not a learning one, and if you are scoring anything below a 650, then you probably just don't understand all of the content. Since you have a lot of content to cover, I HIGHLY recommend [1600.io](https://1600.io) volumes 1 and 2. They start out slow for each chapter and give detailed explanations, with WORDS! Because you have a naturally better reading score, I believe you will benefit from these explanations as I did. I never fully grasped the procedures I needed to perform in the math section until I understood WHAT I was doing and WHY I was doing it. (Resources such as Khan Academy also showed me sometimes worse ways of solving things, and because I was new to a lot of the math , I thought every problem had to be solved this exact same way.) And don't worry, the math is all actually very easily solvable. Once you have learned it all, you might even start to prefer it over the reading section",

For english it\u2019s honestly always come naturally for me because I read since I was little so reading even now, I promise will help you so much in analyzing the little things. Also, annotating not big annotations, but let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading and you see the authors purpose just write on the side, the authors purpose in a couple words. Another thing is a lot of people think that reading the entire passage in the reading section will make you lose time but just practice being a fast reader because if you don\u2019t read it and you skim through it, and you don\u2019t understand the questions you realize you don\u2019t understand it so you have to go back and read it and now you\u2019re losing more time than you would have if you just read it the first time, so read it understand the purpose, the tone and that\u2019ll get you far if they ask you to go back to a specific passage or sentence go back.  annotations also help with this because instead of going back to reading the passage, you can just read what you wrote on the side now of course you still want to pace yourself because that\u2019s what I struggle with so honestly I would just do packets of stuff like EOC testing practice SATs for reading sections because you keep reading you start to see a pattern and what they mean by the purpose and you start to see the pattern in what they mean by the authors tone. Uworld practice questions can also help with the  because uworld is super difficult for no reason so if you can just get like a 75 on some you uworld quizzes you WILL improve. with WRITING I struggle with that one a little because I\u2019m not great at the whole comma stuff, for when it comes to writing, I see just the questions that ask for like synonyms, and and how to connect sentences those are really easy if you just practice and I know I\u2019m saying practice practice practice but that\u2019s really all it is I\u2019ve been practicing English since I was young and till this day I don\u2019t have to study for English stuff because I know it by heart I\u2019m just not fast you can always DM me so we can practice together. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re good at math, but I can help you you could help me maybe \ud83d\ude09",

When school starts up again take a practice test every weekend and do practice questions in your free time during the week. You can totally increase your score by 450+ points as long as you grind, and I promise the satisfaction of getting that 1500+ will be like nothing you've ever felt before. I got between a 1580 and 1590 on every practice test I took after 33, so in reality I improved by 430 points. If I was able to do it, so are you. You got this!",

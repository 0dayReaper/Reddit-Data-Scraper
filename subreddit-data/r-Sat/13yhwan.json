Multiple names in each position is likely not something that was contemplated.   \n\n\nAssuming it is common in your location, a lenient proctor might understand. But there\u2019s a real risk of adhering to policy (Which they are supposed to).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Bear your full, legal name exactly as it appears on your Admission Ticket, including the order of the names.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Middle names and initials are optional on your documents. However, if provided, the middle initial must exactly match the first letter of your middle name on your ID.",

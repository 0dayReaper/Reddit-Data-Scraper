So the dimensional formula of length is M^0 \u00d7 L^1 \u00d7 T^0 , that of force is M^1 \u00d7 L^1 \u00d7 T^2 (as F=mass\u00d7acceleration) and so on and do on. \n\nAs for the algebraic rules, a dimensional formula added to itself just produces itself. Multiplication works the same way as normal algebra. Constants like pi and 2 have no dimensions at all whereas ones like g (acc. due to gravity for a body on earth) have dimensions. Equations relating physical quantities can only be correct if both their sides have equal dimensional formulae (that is, they are dimensionally correct), but they are still not necessarily correct if this is so. \n\nIt's a concept taught in Physics in 11th grade here in India, idk if they teach it in the US as well.",

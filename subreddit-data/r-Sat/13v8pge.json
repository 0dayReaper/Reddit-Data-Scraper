    "postText": "   So I\u2019m (re)taking the SAT this Saturday to boost my English scores (550) as of writing this to hopefully get the 100% bright futures, I\u2019m not concerned so much about math since I got a 670. Anyways, it feels like the reading section is just random to me. Everyone says that there is rules and/or a feel for it but it just doesn\u2019t click with me, what is there to study for? I\u2019ve been doing studying for the past month but am still making the same mistakes. Every time I think I finally did good on a reading passage I check my answers and keep getting these \u201ccoin-flip\u201d type of questions where I genuinely cannot see how the correct answer is correct. Is there anyone in the same position and found a way out? I know it\u2019s too close to change much but I thought I should ask anyways, sorry for the rant \ud83d\ude2d",

            "comment": "One strat that helped me was to read a bit slower and force yourself to be fully engaged in the passage.  Make sure you understand every sentence and don\u2019t skip over them without knowing what the author is tryna say.  You\u2019ll understand the passage a lot better and will be better prepared for the questions.  If you struggle with time management, this strat might not be the best.  But if you don\u2019t, I think it\u2019ll help",

Finding the main point of literature and humanities texts have never been my strong suit either bc I couldn\u2019t care less about those topics and zone out almost immediately. Thanks for the advice tho \ud83d\ude4f",

I\u2019m expecting 770+ for sure hopefully 790-800 this coming Saturday. The orange book helped a lot! I took 2 practice tests recently, and scored well on math, but did worse on reading/writing both times- think like 650-700 range. Maybe I got lucky with the 730, not sure. Anyways, anything I can do between now and Saturday to boost my reading?",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve taken 7 practice exams over the past few weeks in preparation for the June SAT and overall have seen an upward trend in scores EXCEPT for my math no calculator. I\u2019m usually very good at math in standardized testing, but my score is so volatile in section 3. It ranges anywhere from a perfect to 10 wrong and I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this? Section 4 is always high for me but makes me worry about getting a hard section three this saturday.",

            "comment": "what kind of practice tests have you been taking? the 10 official college board tests or recently administered and released exams? If it isn't the latter, I would recommend you try those first. When taking the official practice tests, I would usually miss 7-12 wrong just because they are pretty outdated. However, in more recent attempts with the March 2023 and 2021-2022 tests, I've noticed my score increase astronomically! I used to get high 600-low 700s, but I find myself doing MUCH better now!",

Would you say the math sections on those are actually easier as well? It very hit or miss for me on that section for some reason and I need more practice before Saturday.",

I can't really say whether theyre easier or not, but for reference I took practice test 3 and got 7 wrong +1 omitted in the NC section vs. a perfect 800 in the March 2023 test.",

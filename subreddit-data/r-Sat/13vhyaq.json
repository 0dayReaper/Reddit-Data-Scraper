I already have a 1520 which is great to me, I want to try one more time to see if I can score any higher but I don't know if I should do that in August since I haven't prepped at ALL for this SAT. I'll be charged $35 from the original payment but hey I still get some money back. Any advice? Should I just get through it??",

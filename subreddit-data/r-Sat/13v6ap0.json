    "postText": "Hi, I will be taking the SAT on Saturday and on the website it says that you need to get the admission ticket 5 days before the exam (which turns out to be today) but the problem is I don't have a laptop and I can't get the ticket on my PC since I can't bring it to the exam. I have to contact the school to help set up the Bluebook app on their device but I'm worried it might be too late. Does it matter if I get the ticket tomorrow or is there a deadline that allows you to complete the setup in Bluebook strictly 5 days before the exam?",

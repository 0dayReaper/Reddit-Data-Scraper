    "postText": "Hello, I have taken over four SAT tests and those scores were 1420, 1420, 1390, and 1410. I felt as if I didn\u2019t put much effort into studying for these tests but even the test in June, the test I studied heavily on but the scores haven\u2019t came out yet, I found myself struggling with the math section, specifically the no calculator section. Are there certain tips people can offer me for the reading, writing, and math section? For math specifically, I understand the majority of the materials covered such as systems of equations, data analysis, trig functions, sector and arc lengths; however, there are these  extremely specific questions that is not covered in my textbooks. These ones often ask for the value of a certain linear equation whilst giving us points that itself contains variables \u2014 (a,b) for instance. I\u2019d like to apologize for my poor explanation but I would love to know what those types of questions are so I can understand them better if those questions come up again. I\u2019ll try scouring around the internet to give an example of the questions that I saw on the June exam. For writing and reading, I\u2019ve always received around 5 questions wrong for each and I would like to know any strategies that you high scorers utilized to bring those numbers down. Thank you very much.",

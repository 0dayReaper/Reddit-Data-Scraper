            "comment": "There are practice tests on the [College Board website](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/digital/digital-practice-preparation/practice-tests). I suggest starting with the [4 full length linear nonadaptive tests](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/digital/digital-practice-preparation/practice-tests/linear). Take one, mark what you got wrong/struggled with/didn't understand, then study the living hell out of it! \n\nYour intention should be to take the same test 2 weeks from now and get a perfect score. Remember, if you can go from \\[your starting score\\] to a perfect score on a practice test, you're going to be a lot closer to achieving your goals on the real thing (so long as you're actually understanding the explanations behind each question and not just memorizing the answers). Good luck!",

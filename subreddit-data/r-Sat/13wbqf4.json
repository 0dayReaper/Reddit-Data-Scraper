I try to review my mistakes but I\u2019m worried that maybe I don\u2019t really understand what I did wrong as a concept but just for that specific question. I\u2019m just looking for a specific way that I\u2019m supposed to review my mistakes so I can learn from them.",

            "comment": "For math, if you mess up a question, go back to the fundamentals and make sure you know how to do those problems like the back of your hand. If you get a systems of linear equations question wrong, for example, go back and study the methods used to solve them. Rinse and repeat for each type of question you get wrong.",

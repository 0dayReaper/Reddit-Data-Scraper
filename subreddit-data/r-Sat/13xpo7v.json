    "postText": "Hello, just for some context - I'm taking SATs a year and a few months from now.\n\nMy school is Cambridge-based, and doesn't offer any SAT prep. However, I'm planning to enroll in multiple universities across different countries, including in America. I've had everything settled (such as tutoring centers, the location I will be taking SATs at, etc) and I have plans to start practicing for SATs (I'm taking Mathematics, English, and Physics) after my final year exams.\n\nI would like to gauge how much harder it would be in comparison to IGCSE to create a more efficient schedule. Any reply is appreciated.",

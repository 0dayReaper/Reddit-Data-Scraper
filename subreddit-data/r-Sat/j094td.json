Even though I was able to get in the last second, I was completely messed up without sleep and dining. Also, I needed to run for a while to get into the test center in that last second. I wear glasses and they were foggy all the time because of the high level of breathing. Imagine you have one single chance and everything happens in a kind of way. Especially, Reading part has always been the part which is hard for me. I always used to miss the perfect 1600 because of reading mistakes on official practice tests. I don't know if I will be able to get a good score out of this, literally, messed up test day but I hope so.",

I panicked and was not accustomed to the type of essay they wanted me to write, and I forgot so much math. Even though I\u2019m in a Pre-Cal college course rn, it\u2019s way too easy. All of it is basically review and we never do any assignments in class. It\u2019s all just watch the teacher do an \u201cexample problem\u201d and then, you \u2018learned\u2019 the skill. We have only done ONE test, and now, we are about to do a midterm? like this upcoming week. My highschool math was so much more challenging, and the teachers were so much more engaging and interactive. I miss them greatly.",

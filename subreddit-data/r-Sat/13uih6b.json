    "postText": "They said to have a school approved ID photo, I remember sending in a picture of myself before, but I didn't see it on my admission ticket. Does that mean I have to print it out separately? \n\nAnd what exactly is a \"valid ID photo\"? If I use my smartphone and take a picture of myself, (with requirements met: face and shoulders in view, good lighting, straight face shot,etc.) can it be used?\n\nI have my admission ticket printed and ready to go. Is there anything else I should know?",

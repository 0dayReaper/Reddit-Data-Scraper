    "postText": "It's currently 5:40 AM where I live. I went to sleep at midnight and woke up at 4:40 AM in an anxious sweat and started cramming again for the SAT.\n\nI didn't think I was even going to be able to take the SATS this year, but my mom and aunt busted their butt to put time aside for me to drive me to the place where I'm supposed to be taking them, and I really don't want to disappoint them because of how much effort they've put into me, even with the news of my sister. \n\nMy little sister got diagnosed with cancer in May, and so I had to reschedule my test date, once so she could get her surgery, and then again because of her chemotherapy treatment, but since we were 3 hours away from home at the Children's Hospital, I had doubt that I could even TAKE my SATS.\n\nI studied my ass off in April, but with the recent news, I didn't have any motivation to study anymore in math. I've been doing last-minute cramming, and though I don't think I'll improve that much since my practice SATS, I at least have hope. Wish me luck guys.",

Never did any other direct test prep or practice besides just being in math and English classes.\n\nFirst attempt: (1460) 710 math, 750 reading.\nPractice: (1490) 720 math, 770 reading.\nSecond attempt: (1510) 750 math, 760 reading \n\nThere was about a four month gap in-between the first and second attempt where I got to take a stats class (that was hurting me on math really bad bc I had never done any stats/probability before besides dice rolling, I had atrocious math teachers) so that is the reasoning for the discrepancy between the two math attempts.\n\nOverall I'd say the practice was a fair assessment. In general I'd say the math section is easier. I got lower scores on it mostly bc I had never been exposed to a lot of the content in school and I didn't try to learn it before the test since I wasn't taking the SAT to get into a highly competitive school. But if you've seen all the math before it's not bad, reading can vary widely based on passage difficulty.",

Shy, nervous people/test takers tend to do worse (without using mitigating techniques that is). So oftentimes top students will see a discrepancy between practice test scores and real-world scores",

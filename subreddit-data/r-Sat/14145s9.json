            "comment": "Honestly for me it was realizing how goddamn pointless this dumbass test was. It has no value outside of learning how to do this specific test, you\u2019re not learning anything useful by studying for it. But at the same time, you shouldn\u2019t go in with a completely negative mindset, just balance out your emotions. Go in to the test center with no thoughts other than finishing this exam. Also try not to study or even think about the sat for at least 2 days before the exam. All it is is being confident in yourself but at the same time realized how little of an impact this exam will have in the course of your life.",

The future is unpredictable, what most important thing right now is the present. If you do good in the present moments, then in the future moments you will have great results. And also, your life is not defined by the score of a single test, success is on you not on the tests or anything else. Good luck buddy!",

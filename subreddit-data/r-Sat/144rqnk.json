    "postText": "My PSAT scores have ranged from 1220-1260. I practiced on Khan Academy for about 2 days, took one of their practice tests, and scored a 1330. I would most likely score lower if I took an actual test, but if I continued practicing for about an hour every other day per week, do you think it would be feasible for me to score a 1400 by mid August? I know 1260 to 1400 is a big jump, so I don't want to get my hopes up.",

I found that after doing these, I had already jumped up 150 points just from understanding the questions and pacing a bit better. From here, I highly recommend Erica Meltzer\u2019s books on grammar and reading for the verbal. I just went through those books and did practice tests every week or so. There are 20+ released past SATs online that are completely free to print, and I highly recommend doing a ton of these since nothing is better than the real thing (and Khan Academy, its pretty helpful too.) And make sure to use a watch, you can find one on Amazon just for the SAT. Extremely helpful for pacing on the reading for me, and sometimes the clocks on testing day are miles away and unreadable. Best of luck to you!",

Like did you read through every single page or only practiced the topics which you thought you were weak in?\n\nAlso do you mean one of those 60$ sat watches from Amazon? \n\nAnd I'll definitely print those questions and practice in real time, thanks for the tip",

I went through the books just chapter by chapter for the reading and then flipped around through the grammar, so you can really just pick and choose. While it\u2019s great not to waste your time on problems you already are decent at, extra practice never hurts so it\u2019s really up to you and how much time you have to study. And yes, I do mean the $60 watches. I promise it\u2019s worth it, nothing is worse than hearing from some of my friends who went in and got screwed because they had a manual clock far away that messed up their pacing and got them flustered because they didn\u2019t know how much time they had left, and were trying to do the math in their head of when they started and how much time has passed. It\u2019s worth the investment!",

            "comment": "if your math is 700 or below, that's the easiest 90+ point increase in your overall score because it is the easiest to study. all it took for me was past qas, the channel scalar learning, and 2 weeks to go from 680 psat to 790 sat on my first sat. the stretch of 770/780 to 800 really comes down luck, abstract questions, and careless mistakes in my opinion because at 770 it's safe to say you know all the concepts. at that point, grinding out more recent qas really lets you familiarize yourself with cb's newer questions and recognize what's being asked in the case you're given an abstract question; everything becomes second nature at that point.\n\nmy erbw is not that good, but with the amount of free resources out there and 2 months of time to study, you can definitely squeeze out the remaining points to get a 1400+",

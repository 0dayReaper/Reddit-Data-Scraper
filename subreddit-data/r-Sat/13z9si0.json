            "comment": "Yes the answer is 4, the information given in the question was : rectangular plot is divided into 81 squares. Area of small square is R. Length is 2.25 times the Width. If x(square root (R)) = width then what is x ? \n\nSolution : If say the length is 81 then width is 81/2.25 = 36. I was wondering how a rectangle can be divided into 81 plots but if you have 4 rows and 9 columns it\u2019s possible. That means the area of each square in this case is 9*9=81=R. This gives us x(square root(81) = 36, 9x=36 and x = 4.",

First practice test 3 months before the exam I got 1310, and doing exactly what RichInPitt suggested, I went up to a 1530.\n\nJust doing practice tests will have a very limited impact on your score progression and only serves to compromise an otherwise very useful asset.\n\nRather, you should aim to do a practice test on the weekend, then spend at least 2-3 hours reviewing it and drilling the sections you got wrong(especially in maths) on khan academy. If you manage to get 4 bars on all the English and Maths practice topics on khan academy, you should be on track for a 1450+.",

What I recommend is spend a day going through every section twice. Do the 5 question quiz for each topic twice. If you miss a question or don\u2019t get 10/10, mark that section down for review. At the end of the day you should have a very clear idea of your main weaknesses and ares to focus.\n\nMight take a couple hours, but it\u2019s 100% worth it.",

I scored 800 erwb and 730 maths on a practice test 2 days before the exam and ended up with a 750 English and 780 maths. After a certain point there\u2019s a lot of luck and your mentality going in. Revise as much as you can beforehand, drink plenty of water (I\u2019m serious, this plays a massive role in feeling sharper and more responsive), and go in with no stress. Know that you\u2019ll always be able to take it again. Good luck, let me know how it goes.",

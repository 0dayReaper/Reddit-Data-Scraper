I never studied SAT math but on the khan academy questions I would slip up semi often but on the real SAT I got 800 and on PSAT's I always got 760 or 750. Basically the KA questions are just all of the hardest SAT math questions for the most part imo.",

The issue is that the short amount of time you are given transforms it from a typical math test into more of a logic test. This is because (unless you work ridiculously fast) there just isn\u2019t enough time to do the math for every singe one of the problems. Instead you have to use your reasoning skills to eliminate impossible answers and actually do as little math as possible, so that you reach the correct answer in the shortest amount of time possible.",

If it has instructions, it\u2019s a structure question, pretty much. \n\nIf you got a 36 on English you\u2019re good at the actual grammar part. Vocab, that\u2019s up to you (remember to always read it back into the passage to \u201ccheck your work\u201d). I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s the structure questions you find hard. \n\nThe structure questions are primarily about the main idea of the sentence, of the two sentences, of the paragraph, of the passage, whatever. It\u2019s not about how it feels, whatever, it\u2019s about the main idea. \n\nThere are different strategies for the subtypes of questions. Like for the \u201cwhere does this sentence go\u201d questions, read the sentence first, anticipate what should come before and after, and *then* read the paragraph to see where it fits in the argument. For the sentence combination questions, see where the two sentences \u201coverlap\u201d (i.e. is the his in the second sentence the subject of the first or whatever). For the \u201cshould we add/delete this?\u201dor \u201cwhat best completes?\u201d read the whole paragraph and then see what supports the main idea (this takes some adjusting to the SAT\u2019s logic\u2014it\u2019s generally fine to add a definition even if you personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary). Also, obviously, follow their instructions: if they say give an example that best completes the sentence, give them an example not an explanation. But mainly it\u2019s main idea stuff for those kinds of questions.",

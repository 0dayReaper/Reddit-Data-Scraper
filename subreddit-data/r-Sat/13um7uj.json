    "postText": "Is the 4th practice paper of digital sat easier compared to others? Especially the reading and writing part... my score jumped by over 100 points in it... and I dont feel satisfied as the paper in general felt easier than others.. is it because alot of questions were also present in the linear(non adaptive ) papers?",

However you will probably run out of passages and problems if you\u2019re shooting for a 1400+. If you\u2019re on a budget, khan can definitely be a great resource, but I\u2019d recommend you look at schoolhouse world and past tests too.\n\nIf you have a little bit of money to spend but not private tutor money, uworld and prepscholar are superb value.",

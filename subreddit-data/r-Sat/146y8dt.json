    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m putting together a study plan for the NMSQT and SAT to work on over the summer. I\u2019ve already compiled a list of resources like Khan, r.{test}, and NoRedInk as well as the Princeton list of SAT vocab, but I was wondering:\n\n1. How do I best utilize these resources to study effectively?\n\n2. How often and for how long should I study this summer? I don\u2019t think I could feasibly keep up with daily studying, so i wanted to know what works best for other people.\n\nI\u2019ve taken the PSAT 3 times total with a top score of 1230. I\u2019m aiming to be a NMS semi-finalist and score at least a 1550 on the SAT. I know these are ambitious goals but I\u2019m willing to work on achieving these. Thanks all",

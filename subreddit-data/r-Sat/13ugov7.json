    "postText": "Hello! I am taking the SAT on June 3rd and I am not feeling too confident about it. I haven't studied much for it because I have been busy with school (and I procrastinate). I know I can get a high score if I put the time and effort in so I have decided to retake the SAT in August and study over the summer when I have more free time. My last score is 1240 (650 English and 590 Math) and my goal is 1400 or more. Is that a realistic goal? How many practice tests should I take before the August test and how long and often should I be studying? Should I only use khan academy or should I also buy study books or uworld/1600.io Does anyone have any good tips for studying for the SAT or just tips in general? Thank you!",

I need to work on that better. My parents are too chill so I have little motivation from them but I have to make them assign stuff somehow.

I was already scoring in the low 700s in math when I first started studying, so this may not apply to you, but Khan math isn't super helpful. I find that the questions are nothing like actual 2023 sat questions and on top of that, the khan academy practice tests are a little too outdated for my liking. Not sure if 5 days is enough time, but if I were you, I would grind khan academy reading and writing (for reference, I increased my score by 100+ points in 1 week by doing this) and just work on using previously administered tests from 2020-2023 to practice math skills. After each test, search up videos of tutors going through the questions and pay close attention to how the tutors solve the questions you missed/were struggling on. The college board can only come up with so many question formats, so once you get through your weaknesses and learn from them, you can apply that same question format to those on other tests. In your free time, I recommend you read through the basics of reading and writing on websites like PrepScholar and try to memorize those basic rules, especially grammar rules. Overall, practice makes perfect so don't give up all hope yet!",

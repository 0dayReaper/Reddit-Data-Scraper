A function is where you take an input and turns it into an output.\n\nFor example, if we had the function (x-2) and the input was 5 then the output would be (5-2) or 3.\n\nNow the f(x) simply means the function of x. We don't know what it is, just a function called f of the variable x. We also have g(x) which is an another function called g of the variable x. X could be any number. f(g(x)) means the function of the function [g(x)]. An example would be the f(g(x)) if f(x) was (x+3) and g(x) was (x- 1) and we used the number 3 as the input. It would output:\nf(g(3)\n=f(3-1)\n=f(2)\n=(2+3)\n=5.\n\nIn this meme the f(x) outputted bread and the g(x) outputted an omelette. As a result the f(g(x)) outputted an omelette sandwich while the g(f(x)) outputted an omelette on a sandwich. \n\nIf my explaination doesn't make any sense you can search up \"functions\" or \"composite functions\" and you might get resources such as Khan academy that might do a better job of explaining it.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I just did my first SAT Practice test. I've never studied, never even looked at an SAT test. I got 1340. 730 for English, 610 for Math. I found the Math Module 2 to be really hard. \n\nIs my test score good? Will I be able to get a 1550+ with practice? \n\nAny tips for the math section?\n\nThanks, everyone :) Sorry if this is a question you get a lot!",

However, this is good because getting a higher score on module 1 allows you to have a higher minimum score.

However, you\u2019re going to have to put in the work - you can\u2019t study once every other week and expect to see your test scores rise. \n\nThe most obvious advice would be to study math on Khan Academy. I found that for me, the reason why my math scores were lower originally was that I had just forgotten a lot of basic math fundamentals. Refresh your brain on those and you should be able to get up to a 700 easy. \n\nI\u2019m going to assume that you got a lower score on reading than writing. Focus your efforts first and foremost on getting consistent with the writing portion - if you\u2019re going for a 1550+, you should be aiming to get 390-400 consistently on this section.\n\nReading is much harder to improve quickly. Based on your 730, it seems like you already have solid reading fundamentals. My recommendation would be to **focus less on improving your reading comprehension, and focus more on learning how to analyze and answer the questions themselves.** There are patterns to what kind of questions are asked and where to look for the answers. If you learn that, then your chances of getting the answer right when you aren\u2019t confident improve dramatically. \n\nYeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. Just focus on your weak points and study hard, and you should be set!",

Would my score be good for such schools. How is my math score looking for a Computer Science major at these schools?? I am a rising senior looking for advice!! I appreciate you all!!!",

Id probably look to get math within the upper range of those schools, for instance, for the NC that I found the upper range was 740 so shooting for 740 would be great.",

With a score within range, the sat shouldnt be the reason you wont get accepted so instead you can spend time working on extracurriculars, essays, and keeping grades and rigor up.  Also I believe there are up to three more sat dates before the early applications are due so unless it\u2019s a circumstance thing, there should be a couple more chances to improve sat if you\u2019d like and this could enhance your app",

Your scores are not bad, but to answer your question: No. You need a tad higher. For example, Texas A&amp;M has a minimum of around a 1265, and engineering is a holistic acceptance but tends to stay pretty close to the 1265 although the school *does* take scores that are a tad lower with an amazing essay and lots of STEM experience to back the application. My kids who got into Clemson and Virginia Tech for engineering this year had higher SAT scores than you and were 740+ (typically 760/780) on math. Your reading/English can definitely come up, and your math needs to be a lot higher\u2026probably around a 740 or so minimum. So, you\u2019re close, but not there yet. Hope this helps!",

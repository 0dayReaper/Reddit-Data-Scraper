Most likely, you have solid compression skills but are just struggling with questions, making assumptions, and messing up evidence questions. So, learn to read the passage super slowly and carefully, spending 5-6 min, find evidence in the text for your answer, and make sure the evidence directly supports the answer.",

The trick is to correctly identify the question, and find the info in the paragraph accurately. Obviously reading does help with dealing with long ass paragraphs (which we don't even have anymore) and capturing their flow (again, not too important now), but the test is, imo, an IQ test, not a reading one (assuming you're a native speaker).",

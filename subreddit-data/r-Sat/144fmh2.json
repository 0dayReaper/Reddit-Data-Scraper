Someone said it would be good if you  take a full length prac test before you start your journey. But I am not sure if this is a good score or not. Any advice?",

Those helped me improve my reading/writing score from a 630 to a 760. Also khan is good only if you use it widely. Just doing practice problems without reviewing your answers and knowing why you got it wrong is not the right way to approach the SAT.\n\nEdit: wisely, not widely",

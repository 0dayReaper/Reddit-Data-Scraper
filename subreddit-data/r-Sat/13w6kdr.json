    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m going to be honest. I haven\u2019t studied for this once. Honestly I slacked off for the first two years of highschool before realizing- oh my god this is literally what determines the rest of my entire life. Due to failing for most of freshman and sophomore year I currently have a 1.9gpa. As a junior I\u2019ve maintained significantly better grades this year but in no aps, idk if it helps but I\u2019ll also mention that I\u2019m in some special classes because of my ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). \nFortunately im pretty good at reading, writing and interpretation (not because I studied just because I read a lot of books). But when it comes to math- I have no idea what to expect or do. My mom bought me an math study book but I was literally behind the book so much so that the beginning didn\u2019t make sense to me. I don\u2019t know how to do stuff with fractions or statistics or percentages or ratios or probabilities or radicals or any of that stuff. It\u2019s really really bad and I think I ended up getting an 800 or something when I took the psat.\n\nI really need some help right now.\nHow do I even begin. What do I do?!",

In mine, you can take a max of two classes per summer semester and if you get an A in an honors class, that's already a gpa boost and a grade replaced. Most of online summer education is self paced, and since you technically already went through the course the concepts should be easier to grasp, even if it's accelerated. If you start doing really badly, just pull out of that summer class (for one class I pulled out early enough it wasn't even on my transcript and another just said \"no grade\" which has no effect on gpa). It can be overwhelming and a dent on your summer, but if you persevere, there's hope for your GPA",

Seriously. It's a lifesaver. Start at the bottom; watch a few video lessons in pre-algebra, and build up from there. Talk to your math teacher at school for advice, and see if there's any free tutoring at your school or local library.

You can retake the SAT, even if this one doesn't go well -- if you need it, there are fee waivers. You can go test optional.

            "comment": "I'll be honest my guy.First off, to ensure you get a seat at a good college, the first step that all teachers preach is to get a good GPA. No matter how good your SAT score is, you can't assure yourself a decent college. How to rectify that? Ensure now that your exam scores are going in an upward trend. It might not help your GPA much, but colleges also look for students with an improvement record too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, understand that **practice for competitive exams does not happen in one night.** This does not just apply to your SAT. It also applies to ACTs and related tests, for example, India's prestigious JEE exam. These tests, unlike school ones, do not test one concept of yours, rather, multiple different concepts and their applications in real life. It's good that you have a grip on english, but maths is something you *cannot* do in just 4 weeks, let alone 4 days.Have you given a practice test in SAt other than the PSAT? Do you know the format for the SAT and what topics are to be tested? Do you have at least a basic understanding of the topics tested? If the answer to these is no, then don't give the SAT immediately. Doing so is a waste of your money and time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould you wish to give the test, if I were you, I would crash course on the topics I don't know, and I would give a practice test to see my mistakes, follow by Khan Academy practice. As always, ensure one day before the exam you keep your books aside and leave that day to rest.ADHD is a terrible issue, I suffer from it too. However, at the same time, it is important to develop a little self awareness on where you stand, and avoid falling for the procrastination trap just because a concept is difficult or you can't understand it.Apart from this, I can only wish you good luck. While the situation is grim, I assure you that if you can pull yourself together in this time, you will still stand a chance in your league.\n\nI want to ask for additional reference. What colleges are you aiming for?",

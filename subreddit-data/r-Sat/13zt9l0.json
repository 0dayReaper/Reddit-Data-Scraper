If the school is test optional then you can\u2019t decide whether to submit by that 50th percentile bc it\u2019s just the median of those who submitted not the actual median. Like NYU. Their middle 50 was a 1540 this year! And that\u2019s simply not their true median. So I think its a really hard decision whether to submit a score anymore. I think everyone should do what the UC\u2019s are doing and just get rid of SAT\u2019s altogether.",

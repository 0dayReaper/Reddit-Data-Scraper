    "postText": "I\u2019m taking the June SAT in 5 days and I\u2019ve made no progress since December. Scored a 1180 in December and 1230 in March, am aiming for 1330-1380 in June. Today I took a practice test (KD college prep) and got a 1180. I\u2019m so demotivated atm as I spent hours daily over the past 3 weeks studying, watching videos, revising concepts I\u2019m bad at, taking dozens of practice questions and everything I could think of. I\u2019ve hit 1290 on a practice before so I really don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong. Any advice or tips?",

I have friends that get 1300ish on KD tests and go up to high 1400s on actual tests.",

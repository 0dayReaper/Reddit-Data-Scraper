The issue is, that\u2019s a bit limited with the SAT and not true for my personal case. The SAT is designed to be tough to improve with sheer practice- if it was a test of how good you could study for it nobody would care- and while practice certainly can help, you can only go so far with it. It\u2019d be very tough for somebody who got a 1400 without practice to be able to get a 1600 ever, I got a 1480 on my diagnostic and really only improved to a 1550-60 level with this test being a bit of a fluke. Additionally, as I said in an earlier comment, all prep I did was on Khan Academy, answering a total of about a thousand questions- worth about 6 tests",

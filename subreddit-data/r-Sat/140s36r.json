            "comment": "If m is the number of schools and n is the number of students, m*n must be the total number of students. \n\n[Just like if (unrelated to the pizzas in this question I\u2019m just using this as an example) I have 4 pies of pizza and 8 slices per pie, I have 32 slices of pizza].\n\nIf every student has 2 pizzas, you\u2019d have to multiple the number of students by 2 because 2 slices per student. (Think of it like 1 student would have 2, 2 would have 4, 3 would have 6, etc.)\n\nNow you have 2mn. This would be correct but you need to find the number of pizzas (not slices) the school has to order. If there are 8 slices per pizza, you can divide the number of slices needed by the amount of slices per pizza. This becomes 2mn/8. Simplify by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2 and you get mn/4.\n\nThe host school must order mn/4 pizzas.",

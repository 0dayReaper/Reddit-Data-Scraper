Got a 690 on the real test :) The best thing I think is to go through every problem in every chapter once, marking struggle areas then reviewing those with khan academy practice.  Hope that helps!!",

The book has a greater concentration of \u201chard\u201d problems so you can review for the test, whereas the actual test those hard problems just not as common, like 4/5. I really liked CP, found it nice to follow along with, it builds the concepts well :D good luck!!",

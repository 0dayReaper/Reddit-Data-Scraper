            "comment": "I didn't study all that much, but here's some simple, non-time consuming things I did:\n\n- Reviewed what I got wrong on the PSAT and cracked down on why. Especially for math, they literally tell you what you need to review. Unfortunately this score report for the SAT is $16 so hopefully you have a PSAT to build on.\n\n- Used a PSAT/SAT book (same content) to figure out what math concepts the Collegeboard puts on the test\n\n- Used book to review grammar conventions (periods, semi-colons, colons, dashes, COMMAS). This is half the writing section. (after doing this a bit I was pretty solid on the PSAT and the SATs for writing)\n\n- if you do a practice test, I'd skip the questions I'm already 100% on how to solve (ex: find the x-intercepts). This reduces ego-studying and leaves time for questions that will actually improve your skills. \n\n- the reading section is really just comprehension so just read books that were printed in English often (I say this from the POV of someone who reads so many poorly translated that my eyes just gloss over errors and mistakes...)\n\n- sleep and eat well before your test. I know many people say this but it's true. I made many silly mistakes on my test today, which I'm attributing to getting only 4 hours of sleep. Calculating area instead of perimeter, changing my answers to wrong ones...if I had just slept a bit more, I think I wouldn't have done those things.",

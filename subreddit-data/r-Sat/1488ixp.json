            "comment": "Hello, I personally struggled with reading as well. My first Sat I got a 530 in the reading section. With my Math score being a 750, this really brought down my potential score. So for one month, I just used khan academy. Every day I would do one reading section of social science, science, narrative, and history, as well as 3 writing sections. With this practice over the course of a month, i raised my score up to 670. While this isn't 700, I do believe that you are capable to get there in 2 months. I recommend Khan Academy. If you run out of passages (which happened to me) I also recommend Erica Meltzer's book, and Princeton review (this one is very controversial because it's not exactly like the sat questions you will see, but it worked for me to improve). I believe in you, you can do this. Good Luck!",

It literally drains out my entire energy and reduces my focus to so low!",

But you can read more efficiently.\n\nFor example, a lot of the graph questions don\u2019t require you to read everything. You only really need to read the graph, the last sentence of the additional info (to find the claim being made) and the question.",

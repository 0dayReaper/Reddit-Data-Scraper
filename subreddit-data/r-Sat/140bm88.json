    "postText": "I took the paper SAT for the first time last August and got a 1540.  \nHowever, since the new format is kinda easier, I've been seeing a lot of my friends get way higher scores than they did on the paper test.\n\nIdk if colleges see the date you took your SAT and since I'm aiming pretty high, I'm worried that my score will seem lower in comparison to all these high DSAT scores.\n\nShould I take the DSAT to improve my score? \n\nThankers yall",

Also, an important part of DSAT is getting several real environment imitating practices, I think that staring continuously at the screen for so long does somewhere cause harm to our health because I\u2019ve experienced so many headaches after the practices I took. We\u2019re already so captivated by technology, so why not avoid it when we can. Just my two cents",

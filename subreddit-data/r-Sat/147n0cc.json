            "comment": "Intuitive method: So you do the simplifying and get an = 9/4. So let\u2019s pick 2 arbitrary values for a and b. Let a = 1 and b=9/4. Now, if we add a very small amount of a (inch it up a very small amount), b must go done by a very small amount 2 (it\u2019s a indirect proportion). So, at what point can we inch a up enough so we get the minimum value of B AND that a is still less than b. Well, it happens at the midpoint when a =b. So b^2 = 9/4. b=3/2",

Why 4b and not 4ab, and why multiply it to the equation.\n\nFor the second problem, I was able to follow until the person solved the slope of the line. I understand how the slope of the circle was solved, but I feel like the way the person solved for the slope of the line given the slope of the circle involved a rule that I haven't known about.",

                            "comment": "I've seen others putting up their own solutions, so I'll try to explain what this person was doing.\n\nIm the first prob, we get 4ab \u2265 9 from simplifying. But that wouldn't help because we are looking for b, not 4ab. So naturally, we look at the other inequality. Conveniently, when you multiply 4b to it, we get 4ab, which is present in our first inequality. If you use 4ab it would be 0 \u2264 4a\u00b2b \u2264 4ab\u00b2 which wouldn't help at all. After that we have 4b\u00b2 \u2265 4ab \u2265 9 which means 4b\u00b2 \u2265 9 and you can solve the rest. Ultimately, we are trying to bring the 2 inequalities as close together as possible, so it's worth messing around until you find a similarity.\n\nIn the second one, it is possible you're not familiar with the rule of perpendicular (I actually don't know the exact name lol). Simply, the product of slope of 2 perpendicular lines is -1. No catch, you just have to remember it. Now since the radius at the touching point is perpendicular to the tangent, the slope of the tangent should be -\u00be. (Also circles don't have slopes lmao)",

            "comment": "9) the solution is using the fact that you can rewrite the big inequality as a difference of squares. It works but is maybe not that intuitive to see. Another way is to realize that the smallest possible value of b will be when it equals a. Then the inequality becomes:\n\n(b + b)^2 - (b - b)^2 \u2265 9\n\n(2b)^2 - 0^2 \u2265 9\n\n4b^2 \u2265 9\n\nb^2 \u2265 9/4, then remembering that b has to be positive \n\nb \u2265 3/2 \n\nSo the smallest possible value for b is 3/2\n\n7) the solution is straightforward, but the key thing is that if the radius of a circle and a tangent line meet at a point on the circle they are always perpendicular. The solution says \u201cclearly\u201d the are perpendicular, but the reason is because it\u2019s a theorem, not just that they look perpendicular.",

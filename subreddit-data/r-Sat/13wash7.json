I\u2019m trying to see if it\u2019s a specific topic I\u2019m bad at but it\u2019s really just a lot of miscellaneous questions that I just make silly mistakes on or just don\u2019t know.",

Remember, SAT math comes from a *limited* topic pool. Do 10+ math tests and eventually you'll be exposed to pretty much every possible question type you might see on the exam. Learn from your misses and you'll be ready to see any question type on the actual SAT.",

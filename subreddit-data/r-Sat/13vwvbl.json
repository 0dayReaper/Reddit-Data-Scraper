It's 1-2 questions per test, basically, but they're always doable via other means.\n\nIt's never absolutely necessary to memorize anything in the internetted world, really, but I'd argue that doing so often helps students understand trends, graphical representations, etc. In that context, I would recommend that yes, all of you little monsters should memorize the unit circle :).",

(Could be wrong, regardless it\u2019s uncommon)\n\nSo no do not go through the trouble of memorizing the unit circle, there are much better uses of your time",

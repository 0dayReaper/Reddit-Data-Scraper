If yes - then I recommend you give one practice test without your physical calculator and try to solve all question with desmos. If you can finish within the time frame and get similar or higher score then you\u2019ve your answer, else use physical calculator for June exam. But if you aren\u2019t giving June exam then try practising desmos and definitely get comfortable with it before your exam. Either way good luck.",

I am able to do the questions in the series, but I tried on my own and somehow I forgot how to use the desmos, like the answer doesn\u2019t come up probably cuz I did sth wrong. For example the table then put the equation, that\u2019s the part where i cant do it. So I\u2019ll probably do by hand since it\u2019s faster for me",

But in case you decides to use desmos. Always check the answer of r^2. If they are 1 then all points from table are definitely on line and you don\u2019t have to them manually and. And if r^2 isn\u2019t 1. Then immediately check if the equation and point are correct from question. And even then if your points and equation is correct then do it BY HAND.",

I got Erica Meltzers book for it, and tried to write a tips sheet with the most important information that I found unintuitive. I did the exercises for the sections I thought I needed work in, and reviewed my tips up until the test. While I haven\u2019t gotten the results back yet, I definitely felt confident doing the writing, and didn\u2019t get a single writing question wrong on my practice test the day before.",

For math, I\u2019d say watch videos and truly understand the types of problems you get wrong. Would you be interested in getting a tutor? I feel like that\u2019d be more helpful than a workbook.",

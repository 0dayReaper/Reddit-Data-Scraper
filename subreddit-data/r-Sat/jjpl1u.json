My favorite sources are The Atlantic and the New York Times, but that\u2019s because the NYT offers a really cheap subscription for like a year and my sister gives me The Atlantic subscription. Resources like the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg are also really good.\n\nCompletely unrelated To the SAT, but it also makes you an informed citizen and the knowledge that you gain is helpful in other areas of life. It allows you to make Educated arguments that you can actually back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also like to say that podcasts, while not directly helpful (that I know of) with the SAT reading, do help with parsing Information and can be listened to while doing so many things. I like listening to them while driving, playing video games, going to sleep and other things. You get many of the same informational benefits as the reading. NPR produces tons of good podcasts and the NYT has a podcast called The Daily which is released every week day that is very solid.",

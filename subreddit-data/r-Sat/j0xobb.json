For example, I struggled the most on syntax questions, so I memorized the little tricks the panda writing book had for sentence dividers, punctuation marks, etc. I took it on august 29th and started khan academy at the beginning of summer because I didn't want to be cramming in my studying in the last few weeks. I had a 80 question a day schedule, and doing the recommended parts would really help. I didn't feel like I needed help on math, so I focused my energies on perfecting my writing mostly and some reading. I hated the reading passages but I think I could have scored higher if I had put in more effort into reading. Your score is definitely improvable, 1400+ is well in range of mid to high 1500s if that's what you're aiming for, so definitely never get discouraged.\n\nTL;DR: Start studying early, focus on weaknesses, don't get discouraged by anyone or anything. Big thanks to my mom for encouraging me too :&gt;\n\ngood luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

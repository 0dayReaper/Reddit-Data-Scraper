    "postText": "Hello\n\nI plan to take the DSAT by August 26th. I took the pilot test on January 28th and scored a 1440 (650 English 790 Math)For August I want about a 1520+ (730+ English 800 Math)My parents enrolled me in a weekly SAT English course so I have been working very lightly on English sinceWe do about 2 Sections of Reading and Writing each day for Saturday and review the sections and mistakes thoroughly on SundayBut now that I have a lot more time I really want to focus\n\nSo Far here is my planResource(s) I plan to use: [1600.io](https://1600.io), Uworld, Erica Meltzer Books, Official CB Bluebook Tests\n\nThe Bluebook Practice Tests and stuff will mostly be done with my tutor and we will review the answers throughly so I will have to follow her schedule for that\n\nUworld- I plan to do atleasy 1 Reading Section, 1 Writing Section, and 20 Math Questions a day. Afterwards, I throughly review them and understand why my mistakes are mistakes\n\nErica Meltzer- I plan to use the DSAT books as a compliment. I will first go through the grammar books before the reading books as grammar is the skill that can be easily improved while reading isnt. I plan to do about a chapter a day or every two days.\n\n[1600.io](https://1600.io) \\- For math topics I forgot or need more focus on, I will obviously look into [1600.io](https://1600.io). For questions that I do not quite understand from my tutor or the math sections, I will look into the [1600.io](https://1600.io) videos.\n\nOfcourse I will do summer reading too so my comprehension improves. Can anyone give me feedback, thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Given that it is 45-45-90, the perpendicular distance from wall to flag will also be at least 0.4.\n\nTherefore, Pythagoras gives d to be equal to the square root of 0.4\\^2 + 0.4 \\^2.\n\nThis is 2/5 \\* root 2 or 0.4 root 2 (A)\n\nFor the creep question:\n\nThe steel structure will reach a length of 8.1 \\* 10\\^-3 after tripling three more times.\n\nYou calculated the additional elongation it would gain under the linear model; it reaches a final length of 1.416 \\* 10\\^-3 under this model.\n\nSimple subtraction gives 6.684 \\*10\\^-3 or 6.7 \\* 10\\^-3 as the answer (C)",

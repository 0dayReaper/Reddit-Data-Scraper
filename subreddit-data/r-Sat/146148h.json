Thank you!\n\n**June-July:**\n\nProbably 10-20 minutes of each of these resources *Monday-Friday* but a little less on the weekends:\n\n\\-College Panda SAT Math book\n\n\\-Erica Meltzer Reading\n\n\\-Erica Meltzer Grammar\n\n\\-Khan Academy practice questions and timed mini sections for english/math (mostly focusing on topics I've been having trouble with)\n\n*Weekends* (Saturday or Sunday depending on my schedule):\n\nFull length practice test (from college board) in one sitting (with the break times given during the test) to simulate testing \n\nOR if I don't have enough time some weeks...\n\nDoing one or two sections on Khan Academy's Practice test section (I haven't taken any practice tests on khan Academy yet so I don't know exactly how they work but probably doing whole sections (Reading/Grammar/Math No Calc/Math Calc) at a time when I have time)\n\n**August:**\n\nMore frequent full length practice tests- every 3-4 days and larger amounts of practice in my workbooks/khan depending on how much I have left in them...\n\nDoes this seem like enough/a good plan to try to get my score up?

Instead of doing 10-20 min. of each thing, I think it\u2019d be more productive to focus on one resource for an hour to get yourself \u201clocked in.\u201d I personally only used Khan Academy and watched Youtube videos to understand the topics I was having trouble with (my math score was quite low). If you can afford it, a tutor might be the easiest way to raise your score. Is a tutor something you can consider?",

Find out which on works for you and spend as many hours as you can grinding it. The two undisputables are definitely Khan Academy and the full lengths. \n\nIf you have the extra cash a tutor is also a great way to boost your score. They hold you accountable and can really shortcut a lot of things you might spend ages trying to figure out.",

                    "comment": "I did weekly sessions with a tutor this past winter-spring and it was helpful to do PSATs and practice SATs to get me used to how the tests work and what areas I was struggling with. I switched schools for high school and the math curriculum is different so I jumped right to geometry as a freshman and I was in pre calculus sophomore year (we spent most of the year reviewing algebra 2 and less on newer topics) but never took algebra 2 (I had only taken pre algebra and accelerated algebra in middle school). So I caught up on some algebra 2 topics with my tutor and took practice tests which was helpful to understand what kinds of questions there were on the SAT/PSAT and how they are structured for time. But my score wasn't really increasing as much as I wanted and I got a little burnt out from doing so many practice tests. \n\nThis summer I'm visiting family and then going to a summer program so I won't really be able to do tutoring sessions and it would also be pretty expensive (but I might pick them up in august when I'm back or maybe after my august 26th SAT if I don't hit the score I want and need to prep for more tests). \n\nSo I'm hoping the resources I listed will help and like you said maybe focusing on one to two resources per day for longer focused periods would be better than jumping around too much... I might find that I like the formatting of one thing over the others and focus more on that.\n\nThank you for the advice!",

    "postText": "Does it bother anyone else how easy it is to cheat on the paper SAT? It's a little ridiculous. In my room alone, the guy on my right was just flipping through sections willy-nilly, the girl to my left pulled out her calculator randomly for a no-calc question, and our proctor gave us 3 extra minutes on the writing because we started at 9:18 but she rounded it to 9:15 on the board. As much as I don't like the idea of the dsat, it cannot come soon enough.",

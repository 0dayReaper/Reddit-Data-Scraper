One where the absolute value does nothing (i.e., x - 5 is already positive (, and one where it does (i.e., x - 5 is negative).\n\nSimplify until you get |x - 5| = 2x\n\nIf x &gt; 5, the equation is x - 5 = 2x\nWhich means -5 = x. BUT that goes against the x &gt; 5, so we exclude this value.\n\nIf x &lt; 5, then x - 5 is negative. That means the absolute value makes it positive. We can make it positive ourselves by multiplying by -1. So the equation is:\n-(x - 5) = 2x\n\n5 = 3x\n\n5/3 = x, which fits the \"x &lt; 5\" condition.\n\nSo the only values of x that are possible is 5/3. No need to plug it in to check, just need to compare the result with the restrictions we discovered.",

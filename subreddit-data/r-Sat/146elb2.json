(except my mock exam sections was split 600 and 600) I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019m planning on retaking it senior year but i don\u2019t know when. So basically: how can i improve and when should i retake? Thank you!!",

                            "comment": "Yes, the only way to improve at reading is consistency. Trust me, grind out as many reading passages as you can. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve done the same passage already and ran out of content, redo them. You\u2019ll start to notice a pattern, this pattern is replicated in every test. The more practice passages you do, the more you\u2019ll realize how similar the questions are. Erika meltzer explains this in the reading book and goes over each type of question in each passage. There are ways to eliminate certain answers and you\u2019ll be baffled by how easy it is to increase your chances of getting the answer right. Another tip is, the answer is ALWAYS in the passage. You need to read around the sentence that they are referring to. Again, I highly recommend Erika\u2019s book for reading. Go over that book very carefully and practice as many passages as you can everyday. Remember familiarity with the content will make the actual test seem like a piece of cake. Good luck",

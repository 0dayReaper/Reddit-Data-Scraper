    "postText": "Hi, rising senior here that is wondering about the skills needed for the SAT. \nI\u2019m someone who, luckily, accidentally taught myself many of the skills needed for the SAT growing up (by reading a ton, caring WAY too much about my grammar, etc). This has been great for scoring highly on the SAT, but as someone who hopes to teach others the skills needed in a SAT prep club next year, it\u2019s become a bit of a roadblock. \nI\u2019m struggling to identify the most important skills to hone for the SAT, so what do you guys think I should emphasize rising sophos/juniors focus on to raise their SAT scores? Thanks!",

            "comment": "This sounds ridiculous, but from what I\u2019ve found: **the absolute most important skill is being able to identify where you went wrong.**\n\nYou\u2019ll find that many students assume they need to spend 10 hours a day and take 15 practice tests back to back to improve, but are surprised when you ask them what specifically went wrong on X question or what topics they need to study. Most of my job is getting students to ask those questions so they can *target* their studying and make it way more effective. \n\nThe second skill is **reading the question correctly**, with actual content knowledge coming third. You\u2019ve got to be going in the right direction to get to your destination, so start with that and then work on speeding up.",

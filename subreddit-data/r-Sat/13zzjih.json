    "postText": "Hey there!\n\nIf you took the SAT today, you did awesome! 1200 is a GOOD score. 1350 is a GOOD score. 1480 is a GOOD score. Just relax and be excited to see how well you showed your stuff today!\n\nI know testing can cause massive anxiety in a bunch of people. Regardless of how well you think you did, your test scores do not define you. Let Jesus take control of your life and give you purpose. And for most of you, you can retake the test in the future. Use today as a learning experience to propel your growth in the future. Today was my 6th time taking the test. Between #1 and #3, my score went up from 1310 to 1340. Today, I was aiming for 1540 and a full ride with God's help. We'll see if I get it, but use this story as a testament to the fact that with hard work, you CAN get that score you want. And if you don't, you're still just as valuable and your life means SO much more than a test score.",

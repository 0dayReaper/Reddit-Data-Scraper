    "postText": "I've taken the Kahn Academy practice test twice before studying to get a benchmark of what work I'll need to put in: I got a 1470 and 1490 the two times, with a 1500 superscore (790 math, 710 English).\n\nMath is just basic review because it has been over 3 years since I've taken classes covering the content, but I'm confident I can get an 800. English, on the other hand, I'm really struggling with. The writing section is mostly fine, but I'm consistently (including on the actual PSAT 10) not finishing the reading section. Does anyone have any tips on how to work faster? I'm working through all of my Kahn Academy lessons and ordered the Black Book, which I'll read through when it arrives. I'm striving for a 1540 or higher, and am signed up for testing on August 26 and October 7. \n\nAny tips are much obliged",

For finishing on time for the reading section, I'd suggest spending more time reading the passage and less time answering the questions. Once you read in-depth into every passage and be sure to comprehend what you're reading, you'll be less susceptible to falling into the SAT traps and wasting time.  \n\n\nHope this helps!",

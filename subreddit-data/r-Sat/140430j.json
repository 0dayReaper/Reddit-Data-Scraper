    "postText": "I took the may 6th 2023 dsat, and 14 days later my score was pending still. Yesterday, June 3rd, I received an email from collegeboard telling me that my May scores were canceled without stating the reason, they only put possibilities on why the score was canceled without proof (misconduct such as direct observation of the test security violation by testing staff, analysis of answers that conclusively demonstrate copying or collusion, or a combination of these and other pieces of evidence. ) because it was an automated message. I went to the test center today and found out that collegeboard didn't even contact the test center, and the guy I talked to told me that my score has probably increased a lot since my last test (1240)  and the algorithm for some reason after scanning my test decided that I cheated.  \n\nCan I appeal their decisions? \n\nis there anyone else that encountered this problem and if so what did you do? \n\n  sorry if there were any grammar/writing mistakes (English is not my 1st language)",

If not, contact customer service.\n\nYou can be sure they have \u201cevidence\u201d - probably statistical - they don\u2019t cancel tests for fun. They also don\u2019t cancel tests purely for score increases - at best, it might cause it to be flagged for review.",

I panic so much lol (and if i skip it I feel like I'm nto gonna understand it later anyways)",

Dimensional analysis might help figure out how to manipulate/combine the inputs you have.\n\nIt can also help to just translate the words in the question into equations, verbatim. Then see what you have, what is in common, and how they can be combined.\n\nStepping away and coming back can help after a few attempts.",

I just went on youtube and followed the Scalar Learning Channel, where he goes through practice tests of SAT and other Prep Books. He explains pretty quickly with shortcuts/tips and in SAT time limit. I am pretty good with math myself so I was able to crack some hard questions well. Honestly keep doing practice questions, especially harder ones, don't waste time on easy ones.",

    "postText": "Does the SAT score you receive depend solely on the number of questions answered incorrectly, or does it also take into consideration the difficulty level? For instance, if one person answered three highly challenging questions incorrectly while another person answered three very easy questions incorrectly, would their scores be the same?",

            "comment": "Yes and no. Each SAT has its own scoring and \u201ccurve\u201d. For example, 2 wrong on the May SAT could be a 1580 while 2 wrong on the March could be 1600. This is because of the \u201ccurve\u201d that exists for each test, where college board predetermines the scoring  (what your score will be given the amount of questions wrong) for that specific test. This only takes into consideration the number of incorrect questions, not the difficulty of said questions. But, each section (Math, Reading, Writing) have their own \u201ccurve\u201d aka scoring so with the three incorrect question example you have there, it can depend. If it\u2019s 3 wrong on a very hard reading section vs 3 wrong on easy math section, yes scores can be different. However, if it was 3 easy questions on reading vs. 3 hard on the same reading test, the scores will be the same.",

            "comment": "Within the raw score conversion table on the paper test, it is just the number correct.\n\nThree wrong questions will receive the same score, regardless of which three.\n\nOn the digital test, it can vary depending on which module contained the errors. But the same distribution (one wrong module 1, two wrong module two) will yield the same score.\n\nScores aren\u2019t affected by the difficulty of the missed questions.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm planning on taking the November SAT, 80+, and just started studying (this is my first time). I took a Khan Academy practice test and got 1310, but I think 6 months of intense studying will be able to work. So far my plan is to complete College Panda books, all of Khan Academy SAT practice tests, and all the SAT practice tests available by college board. Are there any other resources I should use? What benchmarks are useful to gauge where I'm at and what score I should expect? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

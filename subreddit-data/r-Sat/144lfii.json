If they gave you your scores immediately and then had to come back a few days later to tell you that they were reducing your score because of a problem with a question, you would probably be more unhappy than you are to wait for a stable score.",

Note that score gets under review if either of proofs is unavailable. Then they can watch video proofs and identify cheaters. Or, as I said earlier in my post, they could make bluebook-server in test day toolkit, so every test center set up it and set firewall in their wifi so only request and responses rrleated to bluebook or cb could pass. For checking in and starting exam, bluebook will require all test takers to connect to wifi of exam center. I mean they could possibly do it along with camera+screen recording, so it will possibly be impossible to cheat and do not get around.",

At a minimum, they need to receive, review, and take actions based on  test day reports and irregularity filings from every test center.\n\nAs we are still in the low single digit count of number of times they have been through this process, they are likely keeping the traditional 13 days for contingency.\n\nThey will eventually get to the \u201cdays, not weeks\u201d that was promised.",

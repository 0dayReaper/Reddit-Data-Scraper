Practice tests often are easier (or at least the real ones feel harder), and you are less stressed. I tried to simulate real testing environments (short water breaks, getting up early). I wouldn\u2019t say practice test scores necessarily translate, but you should score something around that on your real test.",

The actual test may feel harder due to the stress, but you should still be pretty close to it.",

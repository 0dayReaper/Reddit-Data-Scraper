    "postText": "Hey, question is pretty much in the title. I was just wondering if the difficulty of the DSAT is similar to the difficulty level of Bluebook's 4 practice papers. Also, to those who have gotten their DSAT scores, how similar were they to the scores you got in your practice SATs on Bluebook?",

The only thing was that I run out of the time in the last two modules of each section, and also they were quite harder than the practice test. Overall, they are much the same expect for the few things  I mentioned",

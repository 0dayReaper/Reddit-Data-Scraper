I got a 740 on English and reading in test 5, where I also missed 8 total questions. Are the tests graded differently? I like to think I got a 1440 if I base it on other test scores.",

So my question is are the tests curved based on their difficulty? If not then I should've gotten a 1440 total, 740 reading and english",

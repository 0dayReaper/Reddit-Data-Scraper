The only way to fix your speed is to read a lot. \n\nRead any books you want... sci-fi, victorian literature, biography, etc.  The key is to just be consistent. Even if it's just a 15 minutes a day; it's non-negotiable. The more exposure you can get to well-written English, the better. \n\nAlso, there's no need to underline or look at the questions before reading the passage; it's a gimmick. Just read the text properly in one go, then move on to the questions.",

If you're not sure, take a good guess and write the question number at the front of your booklet so you can come back to it later.\n2. Don't rush through the reading passages. It's counterintuitive, but slowing down on the reading passages actually improved my speed on the reading section. You want to really absorb all of the content so that you don't have to go back and reread the passages, which eats up significantly more time.\n3. Time-check yourself. You have 13 minutes per reading passage and 9ish minutes per writing passage. If you're at the halfway point for the math section questions, make sure the time is above or at the halfway point too. Being aware of the time is going to prevent you from speeding up or slowing down randomly when answering questions.\n\nYou'll find that once you have a good set of strategies, there really is enough time to answer every question on the SAT. Best of luck to you.",

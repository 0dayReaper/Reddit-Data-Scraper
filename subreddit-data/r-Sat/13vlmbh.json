Out of a test with over 50 questions, that's a 4% margin of error. That's normal. Nobody ALWAYS gets better with each practice test. \n\nFocus on the kinds of questions you're getting wrong and then address those specifically.",

You can basically break the Digital SAT down into 10 kinds of questions on the English part, and if you analyze which ones you're getting right most often and which ones you aren't, you can focus on those specific types and get better. \n\nIf you're just taking tests without analyzing the results in this way, you won't see major improvements. \n\nI made prep material for each of the kinds of questions in a Google drive folder which is linked in the [description of this video](https://youtu.be/WmW2uswvAeo). I also did short videos for each kind of question.",

I had an 80 point ebrw difference on tests i took less than a week apart.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, if you have been studying smartly, then there is no doubt in my mind that you have improved. When it comes to these practice test scores, just remember shit happens - scores are variable and if u keep focusing on stuff u got wrong ur gonna improve no matter what.",

    "postText": "I ended up getting a really disappointing score of 1080. I\u2019m so embarrassed, but i\u2019m very determined to increase my score as high as I possibly can. I\u2019ve been using Khan Academy for a few weeks now specifically for math, and completed close to 800 questions. Even though it felt like I was definitely getting a better understanding of math concepts, my math score barely improved. I ordered the College Panda SAT Math book as well to see if that will help me more. Aside from that, is there other ways I should tackle to study SAT prep in an efficient way? My test is on August 26th, and i\u2019m hoping to try and get at least 1350+ with 2 months of studying. Any tips would be amazing \ud83d\ude4f",

Also, if you take an hour a day to work through the Meltzer books, you'll bump that score up pretty quickly.\n\nTake a full test every other week or so to see if you have improved.",

Then you can just grind out practice exams with some help. There is so much repetition on the exam that after you\u2019ve gone through 4, 5 full exams you will see an improvement of one to two hundred points.",

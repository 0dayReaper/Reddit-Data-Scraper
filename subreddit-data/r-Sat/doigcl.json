I studied my ass off for 2 months, 12 hours a week.  If a bad score bothers you so much that you think there is not anything wrong with you, but something wrong with the company, that just tells me you would be the same person to think someone with a lower score is dumber.  That's the characterization you're making of yourself, and that's why I think you're so upset.  Do you understand what some kids would do for your score?  Be thankful, and don't allow one failure (or what you consider a failure) to define who you are.  Use this to grow.  Even if you never do better on the SAT, it shouldn't bother you.  Your life is defined by the sum of your actions and the change you effect on humanity, not by your SAT score.  Not even an IQ score defines you.  Change your attitude and your score might change (can't guarantee this), but your life definitely will.\n\n\nNow if we're talking about CB as a for-profit... well, I agree totally lol",

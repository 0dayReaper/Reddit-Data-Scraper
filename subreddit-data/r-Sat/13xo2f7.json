    "postText": "2 days before test day and I'm trying to decide whether I should study tomorrow or just chill out. I've seen some redditors who said that their score drastically increased because they took the day off, and a lot of my top scoring friends say that too, but my practice tests scores have been lower than I would have liked despite studying like a beast. I'm conflicted because if I end up studying tomorrow and get a low score on a practice test, I might get disheartened. Should I keep studying tomorrow or should I let god take the wheel?",

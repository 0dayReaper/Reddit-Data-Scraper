I've always been better at math compared to reading/writing and am looking for general tips, strategies or resources to use for the reading section.\n\n(I'm already trying \"reading more\", looking for something more test specific)",

            "comment": "I think once you have a certain level of reading comprehension, it's about learning the quirks of the SAT in particular (like how the SAT really, really does not want you to infer anything). For me at least, it was really helpful to do a bunch of (timed) khan academy practice problems and carefully read over what I got wrong. I think supertutorTV on YouTube also has pretty solid advice. For the writing honestly, I just referenced random trustworthy sources (ie university guidelines) on how to use punctuation marks/grammatical structures I was confused about.",

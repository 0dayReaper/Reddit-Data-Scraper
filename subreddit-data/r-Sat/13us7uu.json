    "postText": "So I was preparing for SAT and found myself weak in vocab. And I learned words through flashcards in Quizlet, which is much more interesting and better for memorizing. Here is a folder of 400 sat words by College Panda. [https://quizlet.com/ademi\\_samakova/folders/sat-college-panda/sets](https://quizlet.com/ademi_samakova/folders/sat-college-panda/sets)   \nI made it by myself and honestly, the process of making them was really tedious. So I will just leave it here if anyone would like to learn words through flashcards",

I am not sure if I can give you tips on reading, so let me share my math tips. Desmos is a much faster and more accurate way to solve questions, some questions you can not solve on desmos but you can check them when you solved the problem. And just understand how equations work and learn formulas.",

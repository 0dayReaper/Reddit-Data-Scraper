I feel like I did very well on reading and writing this past SAT, as well as calc section, but horrible on no-calc. I want my brain to be fresh for the no-calc section in August, should I just not try in the R/W sections? Should I half try just to avoid boredom? Any suggestions? Will CB think i\u2019m cheating if I purposely get like a 400 R/W and 720 math?",

I would try, but not as hard as you did. Just read the passage one, go with your gut. If a passage is taking up too much energy, then skim it over, and pick the first answer that makes sense",

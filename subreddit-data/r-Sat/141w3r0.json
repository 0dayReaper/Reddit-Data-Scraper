You should use the questions (and answer choices) to guide your reading and focus on what's important to maximize the number of points you earn. Skim the passage at first, then use the questions to inform where you direction your attention. The test doesn't care how much you actually read, only whether you answer the questions correctly.",

This allowed me to answer the questions quickly and surely and I only missed 3 questions on my first SAT practice ever. However, this method relies on your reading comprehension to be up to par already to be able to absorb the points you need to answer the questions. Since every question\u2019s answer can be found within a 10-50 line blurb in the passage, I would suggest that if you realize that your comprehension is your weakness, you should try to trade time reading the passage with time spent finding the answers in the text for each question. (NOT relying on memory if you are even remotely unsure)",

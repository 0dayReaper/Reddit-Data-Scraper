    "postText": "I recently saw a post on Quora that asserted that you should NOT try to take both the SAT and the ACT, as dividing your time between preparing for the two will only serve to lower both scores overall. \n\nAs a longtime advocate for taking both (even if you focus your preparation on one of the two tests) as a way of increasing your number of attempts at rolling the dice for a high score, I found this to be a confounding statement. The two tests are so similar now (especially when it comes to grammar, reading, and math) that you might as well shoot your shot. \n\nIf anything, studying for both should help overall. Exposure to multiple question types focused on the same material (i.e. the rules of math) should serve to powerfully reinforce these concepts and help to compliment preparation for either test. Both tests are completely score-optional per date as well, and the majority of students score similarly on both tests. \"Experience begets improvement.\" Why wouldn't a student want to have twice as many opportunities at bat to hit a home run? \n\nAny thoughts on how my reasoning may differ from the other person's? Interested to hear your opinions.",

            "comment": "I think a more appropriate analogy is training for the mile and deciding to run the half mile as well.  As I said before, the grammar, reading &amp; math sections of both tests are VERY similar to one another. In fact, the most recent changes to the SAT made it MUCH more ACT-like: the SAT went from (typically) five answers per question to four (just like the ACT does on everything except math) and the SAT also changed from penalizing wrong answers to not penalizing them--another change making it more similar to the ACT. The fact that the pacing is \\*slightly\\* different I think is a big plus: it gets the students to think about solving problems more flexibly.",

You may be first I\u2019ve seen that disagrees.\n\nSplitting time between training for the mile run and the javelin throw won\u2019t improve either more effectively than spending twice as long training for one.\n\nSimilarly, practicing ACT questions, with a different scope and delivery model, will not improve SAT readiness more than practicing SAT questions.\n\nYou can take either test as many times you would like, if you want \u201copportunities\u201d. But data shows improvement after 3 tests is unlikely.",

I am only prepping for the SAT but when the ACT is $60 I don\u2019t understand not taking both and just trying. \n\nNot everything has to be hours of preparation or buying expensive prep books, sometimes it\u2019s worth just trying and seeing how you do. :)",

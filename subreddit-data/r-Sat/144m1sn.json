It can't even be inflation cause this is the case in most schools.\n\nIs it just that students who have a high SAT score tend to have a higher GPA cause they're smart and hard working or is standardized test taking as a whole just a different skill not many people possess?",

(By the way, by any measurement, this 1st grade to 4th-grade grammar.) \n\nI read posts that say how hard the SAT is. It's so hard Universities can't expect anyone to know this information.\n\nMy question to students is, what do you think will happen when you get into intense or extensive programs and can't read, write or solve an equation?\n\ncrickets....\n\nGrade inflation is an inflation of grades. It is different than never teaching the material students need. It isn't grade inflation. It's delusional teaching.",

Also there are many kids who take regular classes only (no H/AP classes) and this makes it way easier to get a 4.0 or close to it.\n\nIn contrast, the SAT is standardized, meaning it\u2019s supposed to accurately reflect students\u2019 academic potential across the entire country, regardless of what school you go to.  The SAT is intended to be a challenging test to differentiate between students who have high GPAs.",

            "comment": "SAT requires more intelligence to attain higher scores, grades do not. This obviously varies among myriad schools and countries, but this is a general rule/trend. While grades are indicative of intelligence to some degree, and I\u2019m sure you could find some meaningful correlation between intelligence and GPA, the SAT simply scales higher and faster. For example, a student may have 110 IQ and a great work ethic and studying efficiency and, as a result of these, receive a 4.0 / weighted equivalent, but their SAT score would plateau at a certain number regardless of studying time. Since this is a US tailored question and obviously purposed for the west exclusively, here are some Western factors that one should also consider. \n\nSomeone scoring 1600~ is going to have around 130 IQ~ at minimum, obviously give or take. Your average high school teacher is only going to have around 108~, albeit a little higher on average for subjects that are typically more demanding(i.e. calculus vs gym teacher). How could someone with significantly lesser intelligence than is necessary to score very high on the SAT require anything close to that level of intelligence? That is, their grading standards and harshness could not be higher than their own intelligence. Naturally, comprehension and discernment of the subject at hand is of great matter as well, but recall that we\u2019re talking about studious and diligent students here, so that would be of secondary importance. \n\nWhy high school teachers in the US have such low intelligence compared to most Asian countries is a difficult question. The decline of the US academically(corresponds with the rise of many Asian countries as they consolidated infrastructure and education), the pervasive permeation of anti-intellectualism, the clear lack of respect for education and teachers, the absence of the reverence and veneration for our teachers which most countries possess, or the rise of the Age of Information and heightened screen time usage, these are all feasible suggestions that likely all have a role in the complex weave of causality. What is certain, however, is that America\u2019s high school teachers leave one wanting in many regards.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge that the SAT used to be much more similar to a straightforward IQ test previous to the 1994-95 changes and had a far higher ceiling. It still possesses the function of an aptitude test, though. Perhaps these changes are beneficial, and college admissions shouldn\u2019t be an intelligence game. After all, it\u2019s merely a Connate providence, an intrinsic existence, just like your height or your facial attractiveness. Why should my merit and worth as a human be chiefly determined by a roll of God\u2019s die? Should we seek an egalitarian society? What is bettering our society, how do we judge if these changes \u201cbetter\u201d our existences, what is better?\nI veered off, way off. It was pleasurable.\n\nTo address the latter part of your question, low GPA and high SAT might indicate low tenacity/persistence/motivation and high intelligence. The latter surely, the first likely. I guess, to conclude, simplistically, crudely maybe, that high schoolers in America with strong work ethic and tenacity but middling or lacking intelligence are more abundant than high schoolers with high intelligence and low work ethic and tenacity. Maybe this is accurate. Implications, reverberations, repercussions for our future generation? Exceeding the scope of my own rant? Maybe for another day.",

The content of the SAT is typically easier than what you\u2019ll do in school. Grade inflation is the main culprit behind having higher grades, but it is very possible to study your way to a high SAT score without innate intellect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Someone scoring 1600\\~ is going to have around 130 IQ\\~ at minimum, obviously give or take. Your average high school teacher is only going to have around 108\\~\u2026\n\n  \nNot sure where you got these numbers but the average high school teacher has about a 120 IQ. Aside from problematic assumption that IQ tests and SAT tests have the same content, I didn\u2019t find a reputable study that reported the average IQ test scores of a high school teacher. But a quick google search showed that the average score is about 120. As a personal side note, I come from a public high school where the majority of teachers have at least a masters\u2019 degree and numerous have a PhD so I\u2019d be wary of assuming high school teachers have low IQ. The study I think you\u2019re referring to only said those with an education degree, not high school teachers. \n\n  \nFor the claim that someone scoring \\~1600 needs around a 130 IQ, I could only find this study showing a correlation between IQ and SAT. Using the results of that, a 1600 scorer should roughly have an IQ of 121 (with a standard error of about 6).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How could someone with significantly lesser intelligence than is necessary to score very high on the SAT require anything close to that level of intelligence? \n\n  \nEven if an average teacher has a lower IQ than the average 1600 scorer, the SAT isn\u2019t an IQ exam, it is a skills exam where your ability to comprehend passages, understand grammar, and math is tested. This isn\u2019t the same criteria used for IQ exams therefore, a teacher\u2019s IQ shouldn\u2019t inherently hinder their ability to teach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why high school teachers in the US have such low intelligence compared to most Asian countries is a difficult question\u2026What is certain, however, is that America\u2019s high school teachers leave one wanting in many regards.\n\n  \nTo place the blame of \u201cpervasive permeation of anti-intellectualism, the clear lack of respect for education and teachers, the absence of the reverence and veneration for our teachers which most countries possess, \\[and\\] the rise of the Age of Information and heightened screen time usage\u201d on American high school teachers seems unfair. What is more likely causing it is the fact that people are following the money. Teachers in the US are typically paid less than those in other industries. This is especially true in tech. If you look at A2C, there are so many prospective CS majors. How many of them do you think have the end goal of teaching high schoolers? And yes, a culture not centered around education also plays a big part as for why more people don\u2019t want to become teachers.\n\n  \nI\u2019d like to add that just because someone has \u201chigher intellect\u201d does not necessarily mean they are a better teacher. I\u2019d rather have a teacher that is intrinsically motivated to teach and help their students than one that is driven by money. And if we\u2019re being honest with ourselves, the content high schoolers learn does not need a PhD-level professor to teach it. PhD holders tend to want to focus on things on the cutting edge of their field. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;high schoolers in America with strong work ethic and tenacity but middling or lacking intelligence are more abundant than high schoolers with high intelligence and low work ethic and tenacity. Maybe this is accurate. Implications, reverberations, repercussions for our future generation?\n\nOnly time will tell, but, I will say that just because one shows strong work ethic or has high intellect in school, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll apply that elsewhere so I doubt that this alone will have any serious \u201crepercussions\u201d in the future.",

                            "comment": "I would recommend reading my referenced article and sub articles in that if you are still incredulous toward the idea that the SAT is a very accurate measure of intelligence. I am unsure of where you attained the statement of \u201cit is very possible to study your way to a high SAT score without innate intellect.\u201d This is false. You are simply disregarding numerous studies on the high correlation of the SAT with g-factor. \n\nI am also dubious on where you have gotten your numbers for teachers\u2019 IQ. I would reference this study by Hauser https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~hauser/merit_01_081502_complete.pdf and take a look at most of the figures in the end of the PDF. Further, a study by WalletHub had Wisconsin as a top 9 state for public high school education. It is logical to assume that the lowest-end states are going to have lower, albeit not by much, scores.\n\nThe fact that you come from, ostensibly, a high school where teachers have high IQs(which higher degrees might not indicate, though I\u2019d bet there is some correlation) does not mean that high school teachers in general are intelligent. I would be wary, rather, of not considering your bias in being at a school that is exceptional.\n\nThe SAT IS an IQ exam, by most parameters. College board purports it as a completely ameliorable and malleable exam in order to receive more money as more students buy up materials in hopes of achieving a higher score. Again, if you do not believe that the SAT is an IQ test, I would reference back to my initial link. There is conclusive evidence.\n\nI am not placing the blame on American high school teachers; rather, it is the converse: American high school teachers are lacking in many aspects because of those aforementioned reasons. Moreover, the reason you mentioned about money as an incentive for higher intelligence is merely a subtype or following effect of those reasons I mentioned. Most of those factors that comprise the causal string of high school teacher quality in America would cause the decrease in pay, which would then effect more people to be discouraged to enter to the profession, likely higher quality ones.\n\nYes, higher intelligence does not always mean a better teacher. But for the sake of fostering our future generation and supporting them to maximize their potential, it reasons that smarter people would be more capable in this regard. In effect, a goal to strive for would be far more stringent requirements on being a teacher. Most counties that have a prospering and typically nascent education sector hold teaching the youth in a high regard(and for good reason), and what accompanies that is much tighter conditions to become a teacher. In essence, the goal is to make the profession more desirable, whether in terms of wealth,  cultural view, or whatever. This would, in turn, effect a whole load of beneficial changes for our youth. I would take a look at Finland for one country that has an extraordinary culture and accompanying pay for high school teachers(teachers in general). There is not an insignificant number of countries that operate on many of the same principles of Finland and see the same phenomenal educational results in their youth. I recognize that vast majority of the material taught for high school does not require a high intelligence. This does not undermine the benefits of more stringent conditions to become a teacher(and thus more intelligent teachers).\n\nYour last paragraph is true, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m getting at. The implications of an ever-diminishing importance on intelligence at various levels in our education sector is closer to my end. Idle speculation, merely.",

I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty good.\n\nIn any case, i\u2019m not arguing whether or not teachers are dumb nor am I arguing whether or not the SAT is a good IQ test. I\u2019m arguing that you can learn the content and get a good score on the SAT by learning the skills for it without being able to do well on an IQ test because the criteria to score well on the two exams are different. So while the two may be trying to determine the same thing, you can dramatically increase your score on the SAT simply by studying more. If it weren\u2019t, what\u2019s the point in having teachers anyways?\n\nI also recognize I come from a very fortunate district with great teachers and that this is an exception, not the rule, but my point against looking down on high school teachers\u2019 intellect simply for their occupation still stands.\n\nNow I agree that the US should be placing more of an emphasis on education as a whole and that our education system is long due for reform. The issue is deeply engrained politically as public education is mainly funded by the community the school is located in, leaving poorer districts at a stark disadvantage. Teachers are paid more for having higher education degrees so the better educated teachers are gravitating to where the better income is. I also agree that this is a bit culturally difference between the US and other parts of the world, yet I also hope that the US doesn\u2019t start tipping towards the other extreme of cranking out academic machines like many Asian countries. From what I\u2019ve seen about the Finish system, it\u2019s a great model and I\u2019d love to see it here, but adopting it in the states may be hard. I have seen some schools experimenting with similar, new teaching styles (for example, High Tech High School in CA) that I hope catches on in more places.\n\nLooking at the A2C and similar forums, it\u2019s clear that the very top of the US\u2019s students are still going strong, and if anything, are picking up speed. The main issue seems to be getting everyone on the same page, which goes back to the cultural issues. Personally I believe that instead of trying to get the smartest teachers, we just need to find the right teachers. I recommend the movie Stand and Deliver, based on the true story of Jaime Escalante. Had he lived in Finland would not have been qualified to teach in Finland since he lacked a masters degree, but he had high enough EQ to connect with his students and motivate his class of \u201cdelinquents\u201d to pass the AP calculus exam.\n\nObviously, a single case doesn\u2019t prove anything, but it does go and show that in a culture where education may not be the #1 priority, it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s job to bridge that gap. That takes emotional intellect, not pure IQ. Of course, it\u2019s far easier to go out and find the smartest teachers with a masters degree or higher who did really well on tests and pay them 100k/yr to teach (that\u2019s kinda what rich private schools do), but that still doesn\u2019t mean the students will listen and take it in.",

So while the two may be trying to determine the same thing, you can dramatically increase your score on the SAT simply by studying more.\n\nThis is fallacious. Congruent with this line of reasoning, one could potentially argue, \"You could become a world-class theoretical physicist(any traditionally high intelligence career) by learning the skills required without being able to score well on an IQ test.\" Both regions, in this case, draw upon the same source of power, your brain/intellect. Just because the standards for two things(in this case, SAT and IQ Test) are disparate doesn't mean that they both don't utilize or channel from the same place in order to do well. \n\nTheoretical physics is a very high-intellect occupation(and for good reason). It stands that this is not incidental. Could someone with 100 IQ be reasonably successful as a theoretical physicist? Could someone with 70? 50? At some point, it is necessitous to draw a line which demarcates where someone is intrinsically incapable of performing a certain occupation and attaining a reasonable amount of success. For theoretical physicists, this line is going to be very high. For occupations like a clerk or janitor, this line is going to much, much lower. My point is, all things in life require an innate amount of intellect to do to a reasonably successful degree. Scoring high on the SAT is, of course, one of these things. \n\nNo matter how much training, practice, support, or aid some people get, they are innately incapable of successfully doing certain things. For example, someone who is severely mentally handicapped will not be able to successfully teach a class of fourth graders, regardless of hours taught, hours in college(or interning in a class), or whatever practice methodology one deigns to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;shows that female teachers have the 3rd highest median IQ and male teachers\u2019 IQ are right near the top, within 1-2 IQ points of engineers and within 4 IQ points of legal occupations (which I\u2019m assuming is lawyers). I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty good.\n\nThe data is old. Likely inapplicable to some extent, especially with the huge renovations to education in the US that were initiated near the end of the Cold War and 2000. Unsubstantiated and overgeneralizing, but I reckon the number has dropped since then. \n\nFemale teachers' IQs were always around 4th while Males hovered around 7th-10th. Even so, I agree that it really isn't that bad. Yet, it could and should be higher, and this change can only be effected through a change in culture, along with congruent policy changes.   \n\nI'm not disdaining teachers or the profession for having low intellect, but rather the culture and society that has effected that result. Teaching is a noble profession and should be reserved for intelligent, wise, and passionate people. This is where the culture change is necessitous. \n\n&gt; I also hope that the US doesn\u2019t start tipping towards the other extreme of cranking out academic machines like many Asian countries.\n\nThe US' unique system, especially pertaining to the college level, has, indeed, its own merit. Yet I think it would still be beneficial to incorporate, or tip towards, some of the Asian countries educational conventions. Balancing creativity, diversity, and individualism while emphasizing a coherent, hard-working, and unified society is an almost impossible task, but it is one that the US Government should hold the utmost importance upon.\n\n&gt;Personally I believe that instead of trying to get the smartest teachers, we just need to find the right teachers. \n\nI don't believe intelligence should be the only and supreme trait of teachers. I believe it should be chief among the forerunners of the desirable traits(first, probably) but not with so much emphasis as you are making it out to be. \n\n&gt;Looking at the A2C and similar forums, it\u2019s clear that the very top of the US\u2019s students are still going strong, and if anything, are picking up speed.\n\nI am dubious as to whether this is a representative sample of the \"very top of US's students\", and even if it is, the implications are meaningless. The focus should be on our countries youth as a whole, and the best and brightest are obviously included. We are falling behind India and China educationally by a large margin not because of our best and brightest but rather because of our entire population, and that includes the dull and dullest. \n\nIt is clear that the US is lacking educationally. You mention passion and EQ, or, as I interpret it, the ability to connect with, empathize with, and invigorate the students to achieve their best educationally while still living a fulfilling and non-robotic life, as an important trait of teachers, one that should hold more importance than intelligence. I disagree. Lastly, you paint this as a black-and-white situation, and not just in this regard(also with Asian culture and robotic/monotonous lives). If you would look at a majority of Japanese or Chinese high school teachers, they possess both incredible intelligence(relative to the US and their own country's curve, of course) and the ability to empathize with their students, a genuine care and concern for their well-being outside of academia. The two aren't mutually exclusive, and I would confidently state that a teacher only possessing the former and not the latter is anomalous rather than the norm. This situation that I describe with the average Chinese and Japanese teachers is, of course, contextualized with the background of a culture that venerates and reveres the profession and the teachers. Even the recalcitrant youth, deeply engrained and etched in the recesses of their hearts is an unmistakable respect for their teachers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was enjoyable to write. Perhaps I should, similarly, acknowledge that my own high school is an exception, like yours, but in the converse direction. Maybe that accounts for an extent of some of my opinions.",

Just because the standards for two things(in this case, SAT and IQ Test) are disparate doesn't mean that they both don't utilize or channel from the same place in order to do well.\n\nSure, but the SAT is specifically testing skills, not just ennate intellect and if we bring it back to the original discussion (regarding how teachers with lower IQ cannot teach students to a higher standard requiring higher IQ), this means that teachers can still successfully teach those skills, independent of their IQ. \n\nOf course there are limitations to this. I\u2019m not disagreeing that if you are innately smarter, you\u2019ll probably score higher, even without studying, but I don\u2019t think that the SAT \u201creqires\u201d all that much innate intellect and the issue is certainly not as black and white as high IQ = high SAT and low IQ = low SAT. I think there\u2019s a reason the SAT is no longer recognized as an IQ test equivalent by organizations such as Mensa. \n\n&gt;The data is old. \n\nIt was from your own source.

I don\u2019t think China or even Japan is an appropriate model for what the education system ought to look like but I do agree that they have great teachers. However, a good schooling system goes beyond the teachers (though teachers are certainly foundational to it) and the obsession to tests is something I feel the US (and honestly, any country) could do without.

Take two people of equal intelligence and put them in two separate schools: one private school of extremely high quality and one underfunded public school in a poor neighborhood. Guess which student is scoring worse?\n\nAgain take two students of equal intelligence, but this time with an equal education as well. Both students take it once, but one student begins studying for it a month in advance and uses online practice tools to get used to the test, develop strategies for taking it, and eliminate their content gaps/weaknesses. The other student takes it without any preparation. Guess which student is scoring worse?\n\nIt baffles me that people genuinely believe the SAT reflects intelligence accurately at all. There are simply too many variables that impact one's score for that to ever be the case.",

If it did, why did so many people on this subreddit start with a low score and increase their score by over 200 points? For example, someone may have started at 1100 but increased their score by over 300 points through hard work. That already proves that the SAT isn't an IQ test. It is a test that looks at your test-taking skills and the fact that you can do well in time-limited exams. Time management and certain strategies take extensive and long PRACTICE for some individuals. It is possible to attain a 1500+ through diligence and proper knowledge of the sat strategies. I disagree at the fact that it should treated like it is an IQ test when in reality, it really isn't.",

An ideal general intelligence test is designed so that it cannot be studied for. The SAT is not designed like this at all; it is designed to test on certain concepts to measure a students readiness for college. Of course there is going to be some correlation between IQ tests and the SAT, this is obvious as more intelligent people are going to grasp and recall SAT topics better during their education. There likely exists such a correlation in nearly every standardized test, regardless of topic. Does this make every standardized test an \"incredibly accurate predictor of intelligence\"? Fuck no.\n\nAdditionally, it takes mere seconds to find hundreds of pieces of anecdotal evidence from this very sub rejecting this idea. In the last couple days I recall seeing a person go from a &lt;1200 score to a 1550+ score in the span of months. This is akin to going up 30-50 IQ points according to one of the citations in the article you linked. \n\nSomething that is an \"incredibly accurate predictor of intelligence\" should vary only slightly from most confounding variables and produce no increased scores when studied for (like an IQ test!)

The SAT is much more than a \"relatively accurate measure of intelligence\", and it does reflect intelligence to a certain, very high, extent. Socioeconomic status\u2019 effects on SAT scores is middling. Again, I refer you back to the link I posted. \n\nLastly, and to readdress two things, the SAT is a very accurate predictor of g, general intelligence, which is what IQ tests attempt to measure. If I were you, I would do independent research on how g is derived, for I would provide a lacking explanation if I tried. Although I'm reneging on what I just said, here is a brief explanation: the correlation with which a certain parameter of intelligence has with other parameters of intelligence. Employing this, we attempt to find a \"general\" intelligence, an innate trait that is infused into all of one's endeavors. Again, I would do some independent research.\n\nEven if the SAT did not possess an extraordinarily high correlation with g, simply inferring by your reply we can assume that it\u2019s a somewhat accurate predictor of intelligence. I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re attempting to get at when you reason how the correlation between standardized tests and intelligence is not indicative of a predictor of intelligence. That in and of itself would imply that. The ACT, ASVAB, and many other standardized tests also typically possess high correlation with intelligence. Does this make them incredibly accurate? No, but it, at least, means they\u2019re meaningfully accurate. I\u2019m not nearly as informed about those tests and correlation with g(though I know the ASVAB has a similar or higher than the SAT), but I can correctly regurgitate statistical evidence that displays, irrefutably, that the SAT correlates extremely  highly with general intelligence, or g.\n\nYou\u2019ve posted two anecdotal or simply theories to disprove statistics. While the first one about socio-economic status and prep time has some truth to it, your second example that attempts to disprove the validity of the SATs trait of an intelligent test is simply listing exceptions.

CB themselves states \"The assessment measures what really matters as defined by thelatest and best available evidence of what is essential to readiness forpostsecondary education, including drawing from evidence underlyingthe best of state standards focused on the essentials for college andcareer readiness\" when describing the focus behind the SAT redesign. I don't know why you are basing your notions on what the SAT's purpose is on a 97 year old fact. I don't even understand how you can possibly even relate the modern SAT to an IQ test.

The article cites a correlation between the SAT and g from 2004, well before the release of the 2016  SAT. This is despite the article being released in 2019, well after the release of the 2016 SAT. The source that supposedly presents a correlation is locked behind a paywall. I attempted to look further into sources 13 and 17 on the article linked to see how they measured the effects of coaching, but both also appear to be locked behind paywalls. Additionally, the article only addresses coaching and not independent practice **whatsoever**. Here is an article *by CollegeBoard* that describes a 115 average point increase for students who spent 20 hours practicing on KhanAcademy: [https://newsroom.collegeboard.org/new-data-links-20-hours-personalized-official-sat-practice-khan-academy-115-point-average-score](https://newsroom.collegeboard.org/new-data-links-20-hours-personalized-official-sat-practice-khan-academy-115-point-average-score) . If what the article says is true about coaching, all it seems to prove is that it's significantly less effective than independent practice. I find it to be an incredibly large flaw in the article in that it does not recognize nor cite data from independent studying, especially considering how much more popular independent studying is in comparison to coaching or tutoring. I cannot cite a source for this, but it is merely logical and I'm sure I could find some supporting survey data if necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Does this make them incredibly accurate? No\n\nI quote you: \"the SAT can safely be said to be a incredibly accurate predictor of intelligence.\"\n\nYou are word-for-word contradicting yourself. Is it an incredibly accurate test or a \"meaningfully\" accurate test when determining someone's IQ? Why did you change your mind? What are you trying to say? It is imperative that we understand each other's points here. I am not trying to say that the SAT has no correlation with intelligence, just that such a correlation is not significant because a true intelligence test (or at least as close as we can get, e.g. a Mensa IQ test) cannot be studied for in any meaningful way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally I would like to note that I find it very unsettling  that this article released in 2019 relies on numerous studies from around 2005 by the same author that are all locked behind paywalls. I wanted to see the further data and the variability on the correlation between SAT scores and g, but could not because of this.",

In this case, a very uncanny resemblance. Although a mere personal examination is far from comprehensive, I have taken the 1980 SAT(which has a g-loading of .93\\~, which is higher than many modern IQ tests), and I have taken a few practice SATs that were produced between 2016-2021, and they are very similar. Naturally, there are huge differences as well, but if even 50% is the same(I suspect this number is far higher), that is already foundational for what the test truly \"is\". \n\nThe SAT(and ACT, for that matter) has long been purported by College Board and many large media sites to not be an aptitude test. There is evidence that directly contradicts this statement. They can claim whatever they'd like, and I've already addressed the incentive behind it.  \n\n&gt; I don't even understand how you can possibly even relate the modern SAT to an IQ test. One measures English literacy and high school level math and the other measures reasoning and problem-solving abilities.\n\nThis is fallacious. IQ tests do, indeed, measure logical reasoning, problem-solving abilities, and wide range of more parameters, and the SAT does measure those things. But, all the parameters of both regions draw upon the same thing(your brain, intellect), analogous to how every task in life requires an innate level of intellect. Obviously, being a reasonably successful theoretical physicist(insert any traditionally super-high intellect career) requires intelligence: it is not incidental that the average intelligence in this field is very high. Is it fair to say that a 100 IQ person is not capable of being a successful physicist because of their mental limitations, regardless of hours practiced, hours learned, or whatever. Is is true that a severely mentally handicapped person is intrinsically incapable of teaching an elementary class and achieving reasonable success? My point is, all human activities utilize your intellect, and some are more complex than others, and require more amount of brain power to achieve a certain degree of success. The SAT is is one of these things, naturally. And to score a high score on this exam(1600\\~), it requires a large amount of intellect, which is the same source that IQ tests draw upon. The evidence substantiates this. It really doesn't matter how seemingly disparate two things are. \n\nAlso, the old SAT also measured English literacy and high school level math. Yet, it posted a .93 g\\~.\n\nTruthfully, I've found no studies regarding post-2016 SAT. I'll concede that my data was definitely insufficient to warrant the statement contemporarily. \n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Does this make them incredibly accurate? No\n\nYou took this out of the context, in which I was describing a hypothetical situation if the SAT did not correlate with general intelligence.  In that sentence in particular, I was describing other standardized tests with historically high correlations with IQ. I also qualified that statement by calling them \"meaningfully\" accurate in the sentence directly after. I still maintain that the old and semi-old SAT's were accurate predictors of intelligence, though that's not an opinion. \n\n&gt;I am not trying to say that the SAT has no correlation with intelligence, just that such a correlation is not significant because a true intelligence test (or at least as close as we can get, e.g. a Mensa IQ test) cannot be studied for in any meaningful way.\n\nThis is fallacious. Even the Post 1992 SAT, which had a .93 g, was practicable to a small extent. Just because scores can be increased does not mean that the test loses its correlation or significance. Obviously, IQ, as it is attempted to be measured, means an innate, fixed, and forever unmalleable number. All IQ testing is undoubtedly imperfect and even less meaningful at an individual level. This is, primarily, where \"g\" comes in, which is supposed to be a more accurate estimation towards your intelligence, and it is derived from a cross-examination of many IQ tests/substitutes, and it attempts to find that \"real\" intelligence that you're thinking of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy source was somewhat dubious, I must admit.

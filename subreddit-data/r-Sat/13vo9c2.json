            "comment": "For Q26.\n\nFirst some guess work...\n\nA question that asks for \"a possible value\" usually can be one of the followings.\n\n(1) The value is greater than some value:\t(value) &gt; k  \n(2) The value is less than some value:  \t(value) &lt; k  \n(3) The value is in a certain range:\t    j &lt; (value) &lt; k  \nFor some integer cases, (4) The value is a multiple or factor of a certain value\n\nIn this sense, we can guess that the answer is very likely (A) the least value or (D) the greatest value.\n\nWhat do we know about this parabola?\n\nSince the vertex is (9, -14), the graph is open up to intersect with the x-axis. --&gt; a &gt; 0  \nIn fact, \"a\" can be very large number, like 100 or 1000.\n\nThe parabola can be a very narrow curve opens up --&gt; The y-intercept \"c\" will be a very large value, like 1000 or 10000.\n\nWithout much calculation, we can guess \"a + b + c\" can probably be very large, or greater than some value.\n\n\\--&gt; The answer is likely (D) the greatest value.\n\n\\----  \nMost people solve this question by writing the equation in the vertex form.\n\ny = a(x - 9)\u00b2 - 14  \n= a(x\u00b2 - 18x + 81) - 14  \n= ax\u00b2 - 18ax + 81a - 14  \nCompare to: y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c  \n\\--&gt;  \nb = -18a  \nc = 81a - 14  \n\\--&gt; a + b + c = a + (-18a) + (81a - 14) = 64a - 14\n\nSince  a &gt; 0 --&gt; a + b + c = 64a - 14 &gt; -14  \n\\--&gt; Answer: (D)\n\nHowever, these steps are somewhat complicated, which is not a SAT style.\n\nWhat if it asks this question?: What is a possible value of \"**c**\" ?  \nEven though we can use the above method and say  c = 81a - 14 &gt; -14, there is an easier way.\n\nNote that the minimum y value of the parabola is -14 and all other y values on the parabola are greater than -14.\n\n\\--&gt; \"c\" is the y-intercept of this parabola and it should be greater than -14. --&gt; c &gt; -14\n\nNow come back to the original question.  \nWe can think of \"**a + b + c**\" as the y value for x = 1.  \n(For x = 1,  y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c = a\\*1\u00b2 + b\\*1 + c = a + b + c)\n\nIt is a value on the parabola at x = 1. --&gt; It should be greater than the minimum value -14 --&gt;  a + b + c &gt; -14  \n\\--&gt; Answer: (D)",

Cause we are given the vertex in the problem, we can rewrite the equation as a(x-9)^2 -14. Now the problem wants it in ax^2 + bx + c form, so we foil. a(x^2 + 18x + 81) -14 = ax^2 - 18ax +81 a -14. a + b + c = (add up the coefficients on the x) a - 18a + 81a -14 = 64a -14. We know that a &gt; 0 because the parabola intersects the x-axis 2 times and it\u2019s vertex is located in the 4th quadrant (think about if the parabola should open up or down). Thus, 64a -14 cannot be lower than -14, so -12 is the only answer that is plausible.",

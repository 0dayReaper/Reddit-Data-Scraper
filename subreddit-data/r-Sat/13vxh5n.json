    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently a sophomore and I intend to study for the SAT over the summer and take the test in August. However, when I spoke with my college guidance counselor, they informed me that they don\u2019t allow anyone to take the SAT before the spring of junior year. The main reason I want to take the SAT as soon as possible is to get it out of the way, so I can focus on my passion projects and AP exams at the end of junior year. My counselor also mentioned that I could take the test early, but the scores wouldn\u2019t be provided and it wouldn\u2019t count. They even made a comment about high-achieving sophomores who want to take the SAT early. I\u2019m unsure of what to do to convince the guidance counselor to allow me to take the test. If you\u2019ve been in a similar position, I would greatly appreciate any advice or assistance you can provide. Please help me!",

            "comment": "as far as I know, your counselor cannot prevent you from doing much of anything. if you want to take it, you are allowed to.  the sat has no age restriction, so for your counselor to withhold you from an opportunity to excel in your academic endeavors is...odd. I'm also a sophomore, and i'm taking my sat in 4 days, so as far as my understanding goes, so long as you take the test in high school, it counts.",

Also, I got a decent score on my PSAT, so I don't want to worry about the SAT when I know I can perform well on it with some additional studying during the summer. However, she doesn't allow me to do it, even with that score.",

Anyone can sign up to take the SAT by creating an account at [collegeboard.com](https://collegeboard.com) and registering for an available seat at any site.\n\nHowever, based on your language skills in this post, I would recommend studying for some time and taking a number of practice tests to make sure you are approaching your goal scores.",

However, when I repeated my question about there is no age restrictions, she seemed frustrated. Also, I want to thank you for mentioning my language skills because I wrote that post while on the way to the bus and didn't have a chance to fix it. So, I have fixed my language skills to make my post more readable. \ud83d\ude2d",

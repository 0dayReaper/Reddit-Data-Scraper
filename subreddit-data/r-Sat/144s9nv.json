The College Board website says that you need to contact your guidance counselor but it is summer break so I can't contact my guidance counselor and I need the code because I want to retake the SAT in August (since I already took it once for free because it was required by the state on the SAT school day administration).",

Try writing to your counselor to see if that helps - they may still check their email during the summer.",

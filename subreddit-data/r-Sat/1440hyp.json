    "postText": "i\u2019m a rising senior looking to take the sat before college applications are due. the area i live in is very academically competitive (meaning getting anything below a 1500 is bad) and almost everyone takes it until they can get whatever score they can achieve that is close to perfect. due to this, every center is full (during dates before most college applications are due). \n\nthe funny thing is i live in california and a lot of these students are planning to get into UCs, including me, which don\u2019t consider sat scores in admission decisions. however, i am still extremely worried about not having a good sat score to submit and not being able to apply to some out of state schools. my parents are also pretty hard on standardized testing, even if they aren\u2019t valued as much. so, how fucked am i?",

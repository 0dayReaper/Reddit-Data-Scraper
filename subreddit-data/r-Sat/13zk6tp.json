It rly depends: based on my experience I don't think the amount of times you take the SAT will matter too much, but if you have the time and confidence to study for it again and/or you're going for SAT/merit based scholarships, it might be worth taking a shot. Good job on taking the SAT! ik it can be draining; super proud of you &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; depends on your goals and motivations.",

I applied as English or English Education major, and got into honors for all schools except for Colby, Pepperdine, and Davidson. Good luck on your applications!",

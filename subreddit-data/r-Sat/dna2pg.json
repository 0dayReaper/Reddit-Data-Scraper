At least for me, forcing myself to super into it helped me read the passages quickly and comprehend them much better\n\nEdit: also just to rehash what a bunch of people are saying, read books. They don't even have to be big brain intellectual books, read Harry Potter or some shit. Being an avid reader earlier in life instilled a lot of English knowledge that has just stuck with me so I don't even really have to think that much about it anymore.",

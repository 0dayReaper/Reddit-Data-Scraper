Then I added them all up and set it to 1, then divided by the coefficient to find the probability for blue. Idk if it\u2019s faster than your method",

They are fairly recognizable because \u201c3 more of x than y\u201d etc. Personally I always approach them like this because to me it\u2019s a straightforward approach. You could plug in the answers and work backwards as well and see if things add up, but either way you need to be interpreting the relationships because the variables correctly.",

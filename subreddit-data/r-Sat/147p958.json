It helped me cement the math skills I've already had, and introduced the reading part of SAT which was foreign to me. I'm waiting for my June DSAT scores to determine whether I would continue the course or not, so I want to see how y'all are studying in with teachers, especially since they're so costly.",

However, a student who is really bad in let\u2019s say English or especially Math it could be worthwhile to invest in a tutor since they bring that personalized learning that no online course or video can give you. Therefore, it could be more effective and less time consuming.\n\nBut for most people they have a good idea of the concepts already they just need to brush up on the topics, and explore more difficult questions they haven\u2019t encountered before, but nonetheless have learned the concept.\n\nSo really it depends person to person. Are you really bad in English/Math to the point of almost failing and do you not understand most of the algebra topics? If yes take a tutor if no then don\u2019t.",

I'm one of the better ones in doing math, and have been doing english math since middle school. \n\nThe reason I made the post in the first place is to compare how SAT is in my country vs US or where it's more popular. SAT isn't too new here, but only the academically better kids (which conveniently are the rich ones) actually know of the test. So naturally they would get access to those expensive tutors.\n\nI actually didn't plan to take one, as my first mock test was 1390 and figured it was enough for me to start practicing alone, but I got roped into this class by my friends.",

It will be okay! If you can\u2019t, then consider doing the practice tests as if they were real attempts and use those scores accordingly. You got this",

Along my process I took the test in 3 different states. Today I was notified that college board cancelled my test due to 'no motive' Has this ever happened to anyone? If so can I show up to test site and be admitted to take the exam?",

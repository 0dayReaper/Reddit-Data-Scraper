Pencils labeled \"2B\" are often marketed in Asia as \"exam pencils\" and [will also work for the SAT.](https://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/DocLibrary/ipe/sat/sat_faq_e.pdf) Please be aware that [mechanical pencils are not pemitted.](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/prohibited-devices)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "The main difference you'll find is that compared to the paper SAT, where there is a long passage with 10-11 questions following it, the digital SAT has a small paragraph (or two), and only one question regarding it. I'm pretty sure they test similar skills though, not too dissimilar to the paper SAT.\n\nFor books, I'm not sure since not a lot has been released, but if you have enough time, I'm pretty sure a lot of the more well known publishers like Barron's or The Princeton Review are releasing their guides around the end of July.",

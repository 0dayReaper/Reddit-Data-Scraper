            "comment": "Couple of ways to solve this.\n\nThere's a confuction identity or something (cant remember exact name) that says something like sinx = cos(90-x) and cosx = sin(90-x). Since there is already a right angle, the A + B is going to = 90, so 90 - B = A and 90 - A =B. SinA = Cos(90 - A) = Cos(B).\n\nAnother way is to just draw the triangle. Do you know the SOH CAH TOA thing for right triangles? Sin = opposite/hypotenuse, Cosine = Adjacent/hypotenuse, Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent. If you draw the triangle you can assign some values (doesnt matter which as long as ratio is the same), you'll see that the opposite of A is the same as the adjacent of B, giving the same value.",

            "comment": "Hey! In a right triangle, the sin of one of the not right angles equals the cos of the other. If you sketch the triangle and give the hypotenuse a length of 10 and the leg opposite angle A a length of 7, opposite/hypotenuse is 7/10, or .7. The leg opposite angle A is adjacent to angle B, so cos B, adjacent/hypotenuse, is also 7/10 or .7. \n\nIt\u2019s super easy to see if you sketch it out but since it always works just remember sin of one equals cos of the other.",

Most of the sin and cos questions on the SAT are pretty easy if you remember a couple of tricks but impossible seeming if you don\u2019t know the rules. The two hacks I use the most are this one and memorizing the first few Pythagorean triplets so I can calculate the length of legs or sins and cosines without doing any math like Pythagorean them.\n\nIt\u2019s worth the prep because with those two hacks there are always a couple you can get right in 15-30 seconds, bank the points and save the time for something harder.

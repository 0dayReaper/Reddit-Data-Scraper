    "postText": "Hello. I just had a quick question. So my teacher just told me that we take sat in 12th grade also. I have already taken it as an 11th grader. I had no clue that we take SAT again as seniors. Can someone please confirm this? I actually scheduled a retake for $60 in november. If this it is true that we take it again in 12th grade for free, then i will certainly cancel my scheduled re take. Please confirm. Thank you.",

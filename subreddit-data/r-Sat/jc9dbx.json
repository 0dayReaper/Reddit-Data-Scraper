Watching people work through the writing (on youtube) while they teach you why the correct answer is correct could be really helpful ! Good luck :)",

You're a genius my friend.\nMath is the same over in vietnam, so maybe touch up on your math skills a little, but that english is damn hard for anyone, and honestly I don't see any way you do any better but reading a ton of books and writing a ton of essays. Honestly, the english isn't really gonna get better. Idk how you got it so high in the first place.\nI'm just over here with a higher score than you thanking the lord this test was in my language or you would have kicked my ass and taken my job\ud83d\ude02",

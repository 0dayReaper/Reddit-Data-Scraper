I recently found a template that I use to create online flashcards. \n\nIt made me wonder how many people use physical ones versus online ones to study for the sat.I like using online flashcards because I can type way faster than I can write, so making them is wayyy faster. I am wondering if other people have used them as well.I thought I would share it here in case anyonw else is interested. [Here's](https://blaze.today/gallery/education/flashcard-generator/) what I use.\n\nWhat are other good study techniques for the sat that people have used to get good scores? I'm an okay test taker but I'm really trying to get a good score. \n\nI appreciate any tips!",

I make flashcards for math and writing questions that I\u2019ve gotten wrong and keep them in a little notecard holder. I\u2019ve heard about other people writing it down on a notebook as well. You should use whichever method works best for you :)",

Also, if you take the test multiple times, you\u2019re much more likely to get a better curve on one of the tests, and you might even be able to superscore up if your scores on sections vary between tests. Definitely don\u2019t worry about taking it too many times.",

For me, idk how the actual hell i got this but the first two times (only taken twice) I took the sat, I got the same exact score. First time I did no prep, last min revisions was all. Second time was 3 months after, did so much prep for that, will never forgot my reaction when I saw even the EBRW and math test scores had the same score as last time lol. Don't know how that's gonna look for me",

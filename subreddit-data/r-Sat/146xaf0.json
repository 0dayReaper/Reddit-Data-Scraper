    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm a bit confused on Question 3 on pages 148-149. The answer says that based on the passage, a novel finding of the SkyTEM project was that interconnected lakes and aquifers create hardy ecosystems. However, the passage reads: \"The findings show for the first time that the Dry Valleys' lakes are interconnected rather than isolated; connectivity between lakes and aquifers is important in sustaining ecosystems through drastic climate change....\"\n\nBased on this, I feel like the answer key is incorrect--the project only found that the Dry Valley lakes were interconnected, and from the wording of the passage it seems like the importance of connectivity (referenced in the answer) was previously established. What do you guys think?",

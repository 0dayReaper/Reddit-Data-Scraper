    "postText": "Basically i get so frustrated when i do sat math because i cant understand shit and i sit in my fucking chair for hours on end trying to solve one problem, because im so close to understanding it and figuring out the answer, but so far away that i will never figure out the answer. Im so done with myself because the questions arent even that difficult i just fucking don\u2019t get math. I had a shit ass alg 1 abd 2 teacher that i got twice in a row, and my precalc teacher never gave a shit abt us and straight up told us that the first day. You can imagine how much i learned. My math education is literally fucked and i cant fucking do good on the math portion im so tired i practice but its so hard\n\nthis is more of a rant but im so so so tired if anyone can give tips on how to not abso-fucking-lutely suck at math i appreciate it",

            "comment": "Focus on learning the math, and not the SAT.\n\nKhan academy has great algebra I and II courses. I would go through those first. Once you have a good base in it, move onto actual SAT questions and try to solve those.\n\nIf you don't have a good Algebra II base, every single SAT algebra II question that is worded a bit differently will seem foreign. + If you do plan on taking additional math classes later on, you would suffer without an adequate algebra foundation.",

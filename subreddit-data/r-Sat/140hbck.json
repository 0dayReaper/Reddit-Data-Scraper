    "postText": " \n\nHey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm an international student, and I'll be taking the SAT in August. I'm currently scoring between 1000 and 1100 on my practice tests, and I'm determined to achieve a score of 1550 or higher. However, since the SAT has transitioned to a digital format, I'm wondering how I can best prepare for the exam and improve my score significantly.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice, tips, or strategies that you could provide me with to help me reach my goal. Here are a few specific questions I have:\n\n1. Study Resources: Are there any online resources or study materials that you found particularly helpful for preparing for the digital SAT? I'm open to both free and paid resources.\n2. Test-Taking Strategies: What are some effective strategies for tackling the digital SAT? Are there any specific approaches or techniques that have worked well for you in terms of time management, reading comprehension, or math problem-solving?\n3. Practice Tests: Where can I find reliable digital practice tests that closely resemble the actual SAT? Are there any websites or platforms that offer quality practice tests specifically designed for the digital format?\n4. Content Focus: In terms of content, which areas should I prioritize my studying? Are there any specific subjects or question types that tend to appear frequently on the digital SAT, and thus require more attention during my preparation?\n5. Timing and Schedule: Considering the timeframe until the August SAT, how should I plan my study schedule effectively? Are there any recommended study plans or milestones I should aim for in order to maximize my chances of significant score improvement?\n\nI understand that achieving a high score on the SAT requires consistent effort and dedication, but I'm eager to put in the work. Your guidance and suggestions would be invaluable in helping me navigate this new digital format and reach my target score.\n\nThank you all in advance",

            "comment": "Hello there. Took the June 3rd SAT and I'd tell you it's not extraordinary or anything. When you familiarise yourself with the practice tests enough you'll see the actual test is just like the practice tests, nothing strange.\nI'd recommend you use Khan Academy, Bluebook and YouTube as much as you can.\nYouTube channels I'd recommend are John Jung and Scalar learning(for math) and 3-4-5 tutoring(for R&amp;W). John Jung has a Content guide for the Math section somewhere on his YouTube page, find it. It'll be very useful. Also, get used to reading generally, try to read often as it'll help sharpen your comprehension skills. \nI'd also recommend you take the DSAT nonlinear tests on the college board website and previous paper SAT past questions, after the test check out the above YouTube channels for corrections.\nAlso, familiarise yourself with the graphing calculator on your laptop(I'm assuming you'll be using a laptop for your test) it'll make life easier for questions that have to do with systems of equations, exponential equations and quadratic equations. \nFinally, you need to study and practice a lot, if possible dedicate like 3 hours daily to SAT prep, avoid anxiety and try to stay calm.",

            "comment": "Hi I took the Digital SAT on June 3rd, here are some tips  \n\n\n1. Take your time, in this new version you have so much more time for each question, In R&amp;W each question you comfortably double check on each; on the math part all except 3 or 4 take &lt;2 minutes. Too bad these 3 or 4 take 5-10 minutes each (atleast on my experience)  \n\n2. USE THE CALCULATOR AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!  \nFamiliarize yourself with the DESMOS mini calculator and also bring a graphic calculator of your own for it to do all the Algebra. This saved me heaps of time and learning how to use the desmos calculator led me to answer some questions I really did not know how to do (i.e. Find no solution constant on Quadratic expressions)  \n\n\nI felt really confident and hoping for 1400+ after I busted with a 1250 in my first SAT (paper) in December 2022. Good luck!",

            "comment": "-For the studying resources, I personally studied Erica's books several times and learned a new thing each time I did it, and I suggest studying the paper-based one before the digital-based because it gives you a string base to rely on.for the math part, I grinded lots of books and practice tests, but what really helped me are three things: 1-the panda book and the kaplan 2- panda practice and kaplan practice tests (though they are harder than usual test) 3-the real tests, the paper-based tests have a plenty of questions and can train you about manegeing your time.\nFor the digital-based oractice tests, you can find good quality tests like the ones in \"testinnovaters\" or \"kaplan\", but most of them costs money.",

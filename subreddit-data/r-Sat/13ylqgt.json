    "postText": "So I bought this like cashier type calculator in like 3rd grade and that is what I've been using ever since. Since I am taking my SAT in August I though now would be a good time to buy the TI 84 (CE) everyone is taking about so I can get used to it. I did one google search and literally died. **$100!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!**   \n\n\nCan someone send a link to some TI 84 (any version) thats like atleast below 60 please please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(or should I just use mine with the 9 numbers, 4 operations and the C/AC)",

A list of permitted calculators can be found [here](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy). In brief, all four-function and all scientific calculators are allowed, as are most graphing calculators.

This is very popular at US$25 - https://www.amazon.com/Casio-FX-991ES-Plus-2nd-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B0846D5CBP\n\nA TI-84 series is a very good calculator for long-term high school and college use, but certainly not needed for the SAT.",

They\u2019re usually pretty affordable and you can do a bit more with them than the one you have, I have the TI-36x pro and it works great. If you\u2019re definitely looking for a graphing calculator though, I got the TI-83 plus which is one of the most affordable options and works just fine. Best of luck!",

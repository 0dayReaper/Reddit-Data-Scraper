    "postText": "My SAT score is 940, my math section was crazy low around 300 something\u2026. And I studied for MONTHS on the Khan Academy official practice and still failed it. I won\u2019t take it again just to fail, it would be a waste of time for me. I didn\u2019t even reach the thousands. This was a while ago but I still cannot believe how slow I am it\u2019s so crazy. I have made the honor roll a few times and get good grades but damn. I\u2019ve passed Algebra 1 and 2 with A\u2019s and Geometry with a B. Even in elementary school I was below average or barely making it on standardized tests. Is there a reason behind this, maybe there is something wrong with me or if I\u2019m just a little dumb lol? I can\u2019t sit for that long and read/do all of that in the time limit. If anyone has had a similar experience plss offer wisdom, maybe there is something in my head preventing me from doing decently??? Pls don\u2019t judge y\u2019all are so smart for no reason haha",

So, it may still be in ur benefit to truly learn the math concepts.",

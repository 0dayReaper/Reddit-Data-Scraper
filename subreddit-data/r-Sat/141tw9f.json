            "comment": "As said above, all math questions are worth the same number of points... *but* if you are guessing or low on time, you have a 1 in 4 chance of guessing a multiple choice question correctly and a... much lower chance of doing the same for a free response question. \n\nThat being said, you should never leave any question blank, even if you only get to glance at it. In the free response, typically the best option is to guess a whole number between 0 and 10 (inclusive).",

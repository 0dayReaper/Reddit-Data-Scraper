From my experience, \nI became so frustrated at myself for not being able to solve the level four questions that I recently experienced a little burnout. After taking my *first* practice test 2 days ago, I scored 700 on math. I found that Khan Academy, especially in level 4 systems of equations, can be ridiculously challenging and tedious. And while I was answering the practice test, I found that I wasn't as bad as I thought.\n\nkhan is super useful for *drilling* the concepts, but it does reach a point where it gets ridiculous. i found word problems useful there though",

Also, even if you find that you don\u2019t get much better at these questions, just know the sat gets weighed differently, and when the questions are harder you can get away with missing a lot more questions",

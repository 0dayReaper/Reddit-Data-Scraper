    "postText": "Okay, as far as I know, my calculator is permitted on the SAT and there is no SAT Exam mode. I was just wondering if using the equation mode/function to quickly find out roots of the equations is permitted during the exam? I don't wanna go into the exam without practise for the same. Can we use the graph function to find out the maxima/minima of graphs? So in general, will I still have full range of the calculator?",

A list of permitted calculators can be found [here](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy). In brief, all four-function and all scientific calculators are allowed, as are most graphing calculators.

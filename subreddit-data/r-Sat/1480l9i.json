    "postText": "I took the June 3rd paper SAT and I decided to cancel my scores later that day (I felt really bad during the test). I faxed a signed form on Monday and I also sent one by post just in case, and it was delivered Thursday morning. However, I never got any confirmation from CollegeBoard, and the website still says \u201cyour scores are coming.\u201d Has anyone here cancelled their scores before - does CollegeBoard confirm cancellation requests? Is this normal or should I reach out to them? Thank you!",

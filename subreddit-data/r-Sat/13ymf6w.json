    "postText": "Stupid question, but if I have like questions still left unanswered and the time is like running out how should I answer the like unanswered questions? I know this sounds stupid bc I know the best thing to do is just randomly pick an answer, but is there any strategy to it or is it just pure luck basically lol. On the other hand for the math portion if the question isn\u2019t a multiple choice question and I end up in the same scenario is it better to just put nothing down than a random number or something at all?\n\nIf you guys have any like strategies or like advice I would really appreciate it lol. Sorry if this was really stupid",

Like for multiple choice for the remaining questions should I just like circle/choose like the same letter for each of them? Or should I go like randomize letter choices. Like ik this sounds stupid because a guess is a guess but I\u2019m wondering if there is any \u201cstrategies\u201d to guessing",

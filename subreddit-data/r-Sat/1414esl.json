    "postText": "Hey guys I am an international from Thailand, intending to be a STEM major. Is there any disadvantage to taking the digital SAT 5-6 times? I have just completed my 4th attempt.\n\nSince my first test I have been increasing my score every time +50 and even +100 now. I am close to getting a 1500(am on 1450).  I definitely think I can score higher and the reason im retaking many times is undiagnosed attention issues so the more amount of attempts is definitely helping me reach my true potential score. Can universities see that I have taken the test 5-6 times? If yes, is it viewed upon particularly negatively and is the benefit of 1500+ instead of 1400s worth it. The cmu/georgetown/other exceptions dont matter to me. Thanks a lot!",

    "postText": " \n\nYesterday, I took the June 3 Digital SAT, and it turned out to be quite different from what I had expected. I'm unsure about my score expectations, but I don't think it will exceed 1300. While preparing for the June 3 Digital SAT, I didn't do anything on the English section. My goal for this SAT was to achieve a 700 in Math, whereas my usual English score was around 600.\n\nRegarding the Math section, I repeatedly solved the first 3 practice tests, noted my mistakes, and took detailed notes on them. I also used Khan Academy, but I didn't look at the \"advanced math\" and \"geometry and trigonometry\" parts. Instead, I switched to studying on notes I found online. Surprisingly, the English section during the SAT turned out to be better than the Math section, while I encountered question types in the Math section, particularly in module 2, that I had never seen before.\n\nCurrently, my aim is to score 1500+ in the August SAT. I have approximately 78 days, as it will be summer and I'll have the whole day to study. I would appreciate any suggestions you might have, and I'm curious to know if achieving my goal is possible.",

What I suggest is familiarizing yourself with all types of probably and maybe practice general problem solving questions from a book. I think it\u2019s doable, but I heard the august format is going to be difference since it\u2019s after school SATs.",

            "comment": "it may be easier to process the information if you organize in in order. if 1 chip case, C, includes B boxes of chips, we can write this as C(B). next, it says that each box, B, inclues 10 bags, we can add this to the equation to say C(B(10)). If each bag, being 10 bags, costs 10 dollars, we can modify this expression to be C(B(10K)). the parenthesis in this equation kind of represent tiers of inclusion, if that makes sense. either way, the equation implies that all the values are multiplied, giving you an answer of B.",

If you did C cases \\* 1 case / B boxes, unit-wise you'd end up with cases^(2) / box. That's how you can make sure you are multiplying when you should be multiplying and not dividing or dividing when you should be dividing.",

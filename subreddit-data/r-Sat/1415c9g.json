When I talked to college board about it they said it is ok and it won't hinder my ability to test. I took the June SAT and proctor let me test. She only said that I would have problems applying later, but I don't think that's true. I believe all universities and institutions know about that 20 character word limit, and in addition, we can always explain our situation in the additional information place on our applications. Good luck!",

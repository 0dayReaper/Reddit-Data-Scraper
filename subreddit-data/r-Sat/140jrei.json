    "postText": "Which method do you guys suggest to learn in order to solve quadratic formulas? I know of the quadratic formula and completing the square. I can do completing the square fine, but it is one of the longer methods, so I was wondering if it\u2019s it\u2019s beneficial to memorize the quadratic formula or if completing the square is fine. Also, if there\u2019s another method you guys use please lmk!",

            "comment": "Both techniques are useful, and, in my opinion, are worth knowing. \n\nThe quadratic formula is particularly helpful when determining whether a quadratic has real solutions (ie roots) or not, specifically by looking at the discriminant (the stuff inside the radical). If b^2 -4ac is positive, then you have two solutions. If it\u2019s 0, you have exactly one solution. If it\u2019s negative, you don\u2019t have any real solutions. \n\nCompleting the square on the other hand is good in problems like those ones you see where you have to find the equation of a circle, or perhaps find it\u2019s radius, or the center of a circle. \n\nThe more techniques you know, the better you can use them to solve specific types of problems, as opposed to just trying to use one method for all problems.",

The quadratic formula tells you if there even is a real root through the discriminant, but is infinitely slower compared to using mental math find the root\u2014especially when the coefficients are low numbers.\n\nPlus it\u2019s better than solely relying on a calculator program and exposing yourself to multiple parabola problems on a no-calc section.",

I went from a 560 on a practice test to a 760 as someone who is very strong in reading and kind of average at math. \n\ncommit all of [these](https://blog.collegevine.com/30-sat-math-formulas-you-need-to-know) to memory\n\n[This page](https://thecollegepanda.com/categories/sat-math/) is your best friend. Read through every link on it. College Panda in general is the best for prep. \n\nBe well versed with your calculator. Do all of the practice tests WITHIN the time constraints. Do not give yourself more time. \n\nWrite down everything you got wrong and solve those problems multiple times until you know EXACTLY what formula to use and cannot get it wrong. \n\nTake the practices multiple times and do as many problems as you can find online.",

Did someone else have the same experience? \nI went from 610 digital math to 770 paper...",

Given the distribution of question difficulties on the two modules, vs. the evenly distributed difficult of the static paper test, the digital test should be*, in general,* either easier or harder in raw difficulty, but not the same.",

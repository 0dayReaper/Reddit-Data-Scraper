    "postText": "I\u2019m setting up a summer study plan for the August SAT and I hope to score 1570+. \n\nI just took the June SAT but on practice tests I tended to always get about 2 wrong on the reading (always having 2 less minutes on the last passage and subsequently missing 2 on the last passage), absolutely bomb the writing with anywhere from 6-12 wrong, and ace the math. \n\nI haven\u2019t spent more than a week prepping so far and I\u2019m wondering how realistic it is to practice for a perfect SAT grammar section. I know how some people say that the reading section can screw you over at times but is the same true for grammar? \n\nSo far here\u2019s my plan: \n\nJune: \n\n- Review Erica Metzler\u2019s SAT grammar guide I just finished\n\n- Complete Erica Metzler\u2019s SAT grammar extra workbook\n\n- Complete College Panda SAT grammar\n\n- Read Erica Metzler\u2019s SAT reading prep book\n\n- Skim SAT black book. \n\nIn June I plan on spending 60-75 minutes a day reading/ completing these prep books although I would like suggestions for alternatives. \n\nJuly: \n\n- Start off with a diagnostic full length SAT simulating testing conditions in the morning.\n\n- Using the 70 some released QAS exams, doing one SAT grammar set each day. \n\n- Every three days, do the reading section with the grammar section as well.\n\nAugust: \n\n- Every 5 days take a full length exam in the morning simulating test conditions. (Will get 5 practice examinations in) \n\n- Subsequently reviewing any missing concepts/ frequently missed. \n\n- Take one or two exams on R.{test} to find question types that I am slow with to further practice. \n\n\nOverall, this is roughly 120 hours of studying for the SAT. I\u2019m still unsure of what I got on the June SAT but if I get under a 1550 (i def did) I will commit to this study plan as I realized that 120 hours is only two school weeks worth of work. \n\nIf y\u2019all have any wisdom regarding SAT grammar prep, book suggestions, and just study tips in general please leave them below.",

I just did the June SAT, with probably 3 weeks (really 3 long weekends + 3 weekdays) of serious prep mostly for reading and writing, and I can\u2019t really see myself having much different of a testing experience with more studying. I did study a lot over that time, maybe 40+ hours, but not even close to the 120 you have planned. I really just used Erica\u2019s books for Grammer and Reading, along with taking the official practice tests and analyzing my results very carefully. When using Erica\u2019s books, I specifically marked important chapters and pages that I reread that I though were important, and I made a tips sheet for myself with most of that stuff. Now I used to be a big reader, and so have a very good foundation in reading and writing, so what worked for me might not work for everyone. We\u2019ll see how I did on the 16th, but I think I did fairly well, guessing 2-5 wrong on reading and 0-3 wrong on writing.",

However, I may cut a bit of reading prep as I\u2019ve read that most SAT reading prep books aren\u2019t that useful at the top end - especially since my issues are more time (2 min) than understanding.",

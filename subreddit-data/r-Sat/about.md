Rules:

Be nice.: Do not ask if your score is "bad," or tell anyone that their score is "bad."

Discussion should be on-topic.: 

No advertisements or solicitations.: No post or comment may offer for-sale products services for compensation.  Advertisements for free products and services may be removed at moderator discretion. Do not direct students to video calls or other face to face meetings.  Do not tell students to private message you.

Repeated efforts to promote your free website, app, blog, YouTube channel, tutoring service, etc. is spamming and will result in a ban.  Please message the moderators prior to posting an advertisement or promotion.

No Illegal Document Sharing: Do no post, ask for, or direct a person to copyrighted documents such as unreleased SAT pdfs or books available for purchase. (Documents sent to you by CB such as SAS and QAS booklets are allowed).   No google drive or google doc links

Tests allowed on the sub can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/llxpn0/official_reddit_sat_qas_megathread_pdfs_of_all/).  Even referencing the location of any other test may result in a ban without warning, at the discretion of the moderators.

No Account Sharing: Do not offer to share, or ask others to share, personal login information for any paid online test prep service or product.

No score prediction posts: Do not post asking for a prediction of your score. Discussion threads are stickied for every test date. Leave a comment in that particular test thread if you want others to guess your score.

Post titles: Your title should be descriptive, informative, and on-topic. If you are asking a question, you should be specific.  "SAT Math" and "Please help" are not good post titles. One-word titles and titles in all caps are not acceptable either. 

When asking for help with questions from tests or books, include the source of the question in the post title. Examples of appropriate titles might include "Help with writing question from April 2017 QAS" or "Help with question from Erica Meltzer grammar book."

Post and comment in English: Posts and comments that are not written in English may be removed at moderator discretion

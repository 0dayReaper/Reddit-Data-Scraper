One was \u201cthe artist gets inspiration from native artists and creates his own work\u201d and the other was \u201che gets his inspiration from both native and non native artists\u201d. Now although the passage directly mentioned the native part, there was no mention of non native in the passage but there was a part about him taking inspiration from people who practice boxing for his art and I was confused because I assumed that this was a reference to non native artists. I chose this answer and it was incorrect, the other option was right. \nConclusively I\u2019ve learnt that SAT doesn\u2019t test our comprehension skills as much as it tests how much we can decipher correctly from the passage. This is long, but I hope it helped!",

So for example, option 1 will have answer A and B, and option 2 will have answer A and C. Option 2 looks like it can be correct, because it does contain A, but C isn\u2019t correct, and therefore invalidates the answer choice. \n\nAlways make sure you can pick out the difference between answers.",

If a passage is really hard to understand, try taking it paragraph by paragraph, going slowly through it. Remember, it's better to read a passage once and read it well than skim it a bunch of times and not retain any information.",

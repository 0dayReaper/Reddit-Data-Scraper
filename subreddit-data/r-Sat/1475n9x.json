As the previous commenter noted, my lead (x2) coefficient is positive, so parabola opens upward. This means the vertex will be the minimum. \n\nNow the shortcut: -b/2a (part of the quad eqn) is the x value of the vertex. -(-4)/2(4)= 1/2. Plug that in for x and solve for y: y= 4(1/2)2-4(1/2)-15. That is your y value at the vertex and therefore your minimum point. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would bet that you mixed up the y-intercept with the minimum. Y int IS 15 but the vertex is just to the right of the y axis.",

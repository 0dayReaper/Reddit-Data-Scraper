    "postText": "Hello! I got a 1430 on my SAT and I was wondering if I should submit my scores or go test optional. For the schools I want to go to, it is not within their 50% range, so I don\u2019t know if submitting it is the best option. However, I know the process is holistic and my EC\u2019s and awards are strong. Any suggestions?",

If you got anything less than 780 on math on either test, its not worth applying. You won\u2019t get in. Many ppl i know go to MIT and they all said this. They really care about scores. Also if I were u, i would take it again in august and aim for 1500 plus. To have a decent shot at any of these top schools u need a lot more than you think",

The AO will try to find ways to ELIMINATE the other candidate and the test scores can be one part of the process. My college counselor (who was an AO at Duke) has always said, \u201cif you get a 1400+ ALWAYS submit it\u201d. And yeah, I truly believe it\u2019s a good idea because anything above a 1400 never will hurt you and if it doesn\u2019t HURT you, then always submit it",

Grade wise you need to be at 3.9 UW gpa minimum, and in the 10th percentile of your school for academics. If your school offers 30 honors/ap u must take around half of them. Also consider doing additional classes outside of school. For the sat, i strongly recommend above 1500, and depending on the major u should have a good math score. Additionally, for ECs u should be putting abt 30 hrs a week into them. For example I run a national organization, biggest club in my school, editor in chief for school newspaper and another outside of school newspaper, volunteered at the same place for since about middle school and more. Even this may not be good enough as each activity has to be really strong. Also from my school about 1/4 of the class goes to top 20 universities, so that helps my chances as well. Tbh don\u2019t stress it too much if you don\u2019t get in. Literally I don\u2019t have high expectations at all really for most of the schools. Like at MIT my chances are probably 25% max despite my sat being 1560. I just hope I get into one of my state schools",

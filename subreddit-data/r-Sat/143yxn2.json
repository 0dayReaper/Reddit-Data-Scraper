    "postText": "Hi, I scored 1590 on last August's SAT. Since then I've been tutoring students and one of them even got 1570.\n\nI also consistently scored 1550, 1560, and 1580 on my last three practice tests, so I'd say I have my way. Here are some of my key takeaways to answer the \"Should I learn vocabulary\" questions I frequently get.\n\nThis will be a lengthy post, so buckle up ;)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLearning vocabulary on the SAT is arguably one of the most arduous feats for this exam; it also is quite debatable. Not every body can learn and memorise hundreds of difficult words, nor do they have the resources to. So if you spend countless time on learning something that's ineffective, it will harm you time-wise and mentality-wise. Let's see how you can change that.\n\n## Don't learn Vocabulary\n\nI know, before you throw your sticks and stones at me, hear me out.\n\nYou shouldn't learn Vocabulary if:\n\n* You already have a decent vocabulary (usable).\n* You are preparing in less than 2 months.\n* You still struggle with understanding some paragraphs although you've learnt a fair share of new words.\n\n## You already have a decent vocabulary\n\nIf you already have a decent vocabulary, meaning you normally read a lot, this advice should come as a no-brainer. However, some students who have exceptional vocabulary felt discouraged by the sheer amount of new words they still encounter on the SAT. That said, even if you have an extensive word bank, you're still going to encounter some troubles.\n\nThe truth is, no one (I mean at least 95% of students who take the SAT won't) understands every single word on the SAT (I wouldn't expect any high-schooler to understand *pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis* but hey if there's a passage about this, we're still going to have to deal with it.)\n\nThere are absolutely monstrous passages/paragraphs where you can only understand every other word, but still, people get absolute scores all the time right? What did they do? They find ways to get around actually understanding the words themselves.\n\n## You are preparing in less than 2 months\n\nI personally started prepping for the SAT in late June and took part in August SAT, so I am most familiar with this situation. There's nothing wrong with this; in fact, I think **2 months is the right amount of time one should spend on prepping for the SAT** whether or not you have had a solid background in English or Mathematics (or at least you aim for an about 300 score increase).\n\nRegardless, the nature of this time frame is that you should purely focus on studying for the SAT, not your Vocabulary. 2 months is enough for you to go from 1000 to the upper 1400, or even 1500 if you just learn for the SAT. In addition, if you aim for a perfect score, it remains correct. Although you still need a solid English background, you have to put more focus on preparing for every possible scenario including, but totally not limited to, encountering a completely new word, accidentally leaving difficult passages/paragraphs for last, and running low on time. Sometimes, a perfect scorer should also prepare him/her/them-self for external factors such as you had a bad start to the day, you didn't sleep well, you're nervous, etc.\n\nI'll dive deeper into how you can aim for a perfect score by understanding their strategy in a future post. Perfect scorers have to stay on top of everything in their preparation process.\n\n## You still struggle with understanding some paragraphs although you've learnt a fair share of new words\n\nThis is kinda similar to the first scenario. It is a sign that you have been learning the SAT wrong. The SAT doesn't test your ability to memorise words, it tests your ability to read the **context** or your reading comprehension.\n\nOne way to fix this is to reestablish your strategy or thinking process to further align with what the SAT is testing.\n\n## When should you learn Vocabulary?\n\nYou should learn Vocabulary if:\n\n* You don't have a firm background in English.\n* You have an excessive amount of time to prepare (more than 3 months).\n* You aim for a perfect score (and you have plenty of time).\n\n## You don't have a firm background in English\n\nIf you don't have a firm background in English then the SAT is not going to be the only thing that troubles you. My general advice is to learn English rather than to learn for the SAT. And after you get better, learn the SAT.\n\n## You have an excessive amount of time to prepare (more than 3 months)\n\nThis is when time is in your favour. You can improve every single aspect of the SAT. Do you want to improve your knowledge of dated passages and poems? Just read more from Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, or Shakespeare.\n\nPick a book, a storyline, or a subject which intrigues you and dive into it. Remember to have fun as you're going to have to stick with it for a long time.\n\n## You aim for a perfect score (and you have plenty of time)\n\nThis is, again, a case in which time is in your favour. If you aim for a perfect score, perfection is the goal. You have to focus on honing even the minutest of skills (and that includes understanding every shade and second meaning of a word.)\n\nNot only that, a perfect scorer has to understand what to expect for the SAT, they would learn and dissect the exam many times over until they understand the key to this **standardised test**.\n\n## Attention!\n\n**You MUST learn new words if they are from the Maths section.** In this case, the problem isn't your vocabulary but your knowledge of a mathematics concept. If you ever encounter new words like this, don't just look them up in your preferred language, or find its definition only. Relearn everything related to that concept immediately.\n\n## Summary\n\nIt depends on both your goal and your time to determine whether or not you should spend time learning more Vocabulary. In conclusion, if you aim to study explicitly for the SAT then don't, but if you aim to improve your English skills in general then please do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbtw, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day and good luck out there!

            "comment": "Exactly. Unless the digital SAT is just completely different, the chances of a vocab word that you studied showing up is extremely small.\n\nThe time it would take to memorize 400 new vocab words can be much better spent prepping in other ways for the SAT.\n\nIf one still insists on doing this, then I would personally look into learning some common root words and then try to make educated guesses on the test, rather than trying to go through a quizlet just trying to learn as many new obscure words as you can.",

The odds of picking the few of the 100,000+ words in common use is extremely slim.\n\nIf it means reading a lot, looking up unrecognized word, and exploring the roots of those words to understand how words are constructed, rather than memorizing a list - yes. That\u2019s something that smart, inquisitive students have been doing for a long time, and it\u2019s basically how you build a vocabulary (Which differs from memorization). I still do it today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;btw, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust\n\n  \nQuite sesquipedalianistic of you.",

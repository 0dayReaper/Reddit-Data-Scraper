    "postText": "Hello guys. I needed help. I gave a diagnostic test(paper pencil ver.), and I scored 600 math and 470 English. Now I am starting my preparation, so I wanted to ask if khanacademy is enough for maths to get 750+. Like every other book, including khan, provides basic explanation towards the content, so first, i am studying the whole content on khan, and then i will move on to practice. Its all about dealing with questions and how good the explanation your guide(anybook or khan) provides, isn't it? I guess khan will do it math. What do you guys say? Was worried about English more because it's weak. Will khan work for both?",

Khan was really the only resource I ever used, and it helped me quite a bit (my first psat w/o studying was 1360/1520).",

But for a 750+ score the most important thing in my (tutor for 10 years) opinion is that you know how to use your pencil to keep your work smooth and consistent.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of math ace students who had baseline scores in the 600s because they were either making silly mistakes or doing too much in their head, which adds stress and depletes mental stamina. \n\nBasically if you want that near-perfect score, fit in some practice that matches your actual testing conditions so that it all \u201cfeels right\u201d on test day.",

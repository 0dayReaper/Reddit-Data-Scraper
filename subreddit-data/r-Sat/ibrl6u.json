A little disappointing, but not too bad for my first time, especially when I was only a 7th grader. \n\nAnyway, the moral of the story is that if you're just smart, you don't have to study - studying is literally just a waste of time, so I'd advise against it",

As you mentioned in your follow up below, it all depends on how long until your exam, but if you can start early, then 10 minutes a day is truly the way to go.

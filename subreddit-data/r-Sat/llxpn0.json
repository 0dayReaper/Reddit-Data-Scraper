While this is the case for the PSAT 8/9, the PSAT 10 is literally the same test as the PSAT/NMSQT, the only differences being when it's offered and that it cannot qualify for national merit.",

Khan Academy uses the CollegeBoard 10 tests and a few extra practice materials which are strongly recommended. Practice tests 1-4 or 1-6 were released when the SAT was updated in 2016. Tests 5-10 or 7-10 (it really doesn't matter) were actual SAT tests at one point and then were officially released via CollegeBoard. QAS tests (Questions and Answer Service) was designed by CB so that students who take certain tests during the year can actually see the test they've taken, along with questions they got right and wrong. Over time, this subreddit compiled all of those unofficially-released-but-technically-released-QAS-tests so that everyone can access them since CB doesn't have the QAS tests on their site. I recommend having someone else mark down your wrong answers with an X and not to have the right answer and try them again to see if you would get them. Repeat but this time have the answers next to them. REview types of questions you get wrong and focus on those on platforms like Khan Academy and a couple of textbooks (Erica Meltzer Critical Reader / College Panda Writing / College Panda Math)",

Also, what do you mean by practice tests 1-4 (or 1-6) were released when the SAT was updated in 2016? Are you referring to the 10 SAT practice tests on KhanAcademy and the same 10 SAT practice tests that are available in written form on the CollegeBoard website? Furthermore, when you mention practice tests 5-10 (or 7-10) those are the SAT practice tests on KhanAcademy and the written ones on CollegeBoard right? Lastly, I was reading the CB website of the written practice tests and they talk about a way to scan my answers to check them... but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Not sure what\u2019s going on. So is there a way I can scan my answers to see if they are right for the SAT written practice tests? Also, does the same go for QAS... is there a way to scan those answers as well and see if they are right? Once again, thank you!",

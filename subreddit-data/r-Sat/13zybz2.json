    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a rising senior looking to apply early action to about eight universities that are mostly around 40 to 50% acceptance rate with a few reaches like Vanderbilt. I currently have a 1440 SAT with a 740 in math and 700 in English. I was wondering if it would be worth it to retake the SAT, but I\u2019ve already taken it four times. I was thinking this because it might increase my merit scholarships, as my dream school is Pepperdine and it is very very expensive. Thank you so much for the suggestions!",

It's saying that (x^(1/3)), in parentheses, is squared.\n\nThat means (x^(1/3))^(2) and when an exponent is raised by another exponent, the two exponents are multiplied. Since (1/3)(2) = 2/3, then (x^(1/3))^(2) equals x^(2/3).\n\nHope that makes sense. There's no way to do double superscripts in Reddit, so the formatting isn't quite right!",

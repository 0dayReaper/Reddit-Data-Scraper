With that being said, It's different in a way, let me explain:\n\n1. The questions are less wordy, it's hard to get confused over tricky wording, or accidentally miss a critcal word or phrase. You could use this to say it's easier.\n\n2. The scoring is harsher afaik. You could use this to say it's harder.\n\n3. It's adaptive to your abilities. You could use this to say really anything, easier/the same/harder, it depends on your own skillset.",

So while the difficult questions are no harder than previous difficult questions, their frequency means the overall average difficultly will be higher, yes.\n\nFor those not performing well, the second module will be easier.\n\nAnd the net result, on an equated 200-800 scale, will not change. A given level of performance should result in the same score for paper and digital tests, despite the fact that there will likely be a higher percentage of errors on the digital test.",

But my issue with it is that it asks questions that I've never really seen on SATs before, and it also focuses too much on teaching you math and not enough on teaching strategies. A lot of the time, there's a way to work backwards or pick numbers that's more efficient than the suggested solutions. Keep that in mind if you hit questions or chapters that you struggle with.",

I've made video explanations of all the questions from College Board tests #5-10. Watch them for the questions you struggle with. If there's a more efficient strategy, I promise I'll explain it. Feel free to chat me directly or post in my own subreddit about questions that I haven't made videos for yet. \n\nFor Writing, learning the rules is very helpful, but the bigger overall strategy is to learn how to \"Predict the Question\" so that you know when to think about rules versus when to think about the style or ideas in a sentence. The different question types use different parts of our brains, so we need to know what we're dealing with so we can avoid the SAT's traps. Start with [my video lesson](https://setteletutoring.bubbleapps.io/ebrw_tool) on how to Predict the Question, which will also review some of the most common grammar rules. It will help you start noticing what each question type will look like.",

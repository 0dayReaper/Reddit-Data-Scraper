The way it works in the US is that at least for the math section, we indirectly get ready for it through the math we do through K-12 Grades , so we already have that built in intuition to do decently well. In other words we have a strong base , and then we prepare from there to target specific areas depending from person to person.\n\nIf where you live doesn't provide that base , it will be a little harder since you have to learn the basics from scratch. I would recommend just working through all of Khan Academy slowly and surely , but know this will take like a few months of effort if you want to see a big jump in ur score . Good luck man Ik you can do whatever you want to",

Same for the reading as well.\n\nUse whatever resources you can (khan is a good one for this), to be proficient upto algebra II. Read more to improve your comprehension. Unless you're on an extreme time crunch, I feel that doing that is more beneficial that just cranking out sat practice problems.",

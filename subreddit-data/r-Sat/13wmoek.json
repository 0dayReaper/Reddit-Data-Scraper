    "postText": "There is a guy in my grade who I am 100% sure cheated on the SAT last december back when it was still on paper (we're international). The person he bought the answers from literally showed me proof with their texts. But obviously the person wouldn't send me the screenshots because he'd get in trouble as well (pretty sure he bought the answers from taobao or some other chinese site). The person who cheated got a very, very bad score in November and shot up to 1550+ in December, so it would look suspicious (there's no way someone can improve that much in one month, especially him who is famous for cheating even on in-school exams), but without me sending in screenshots, would collegeboard care if I reported him? \n\nSidenote: It makes me so fucking mad that people can cheat like this. His peers work so hard on studying for the SAT. Some are even flying to the US this summer so they can take the paper version since that is what they have been preparing for. This dick literally asked me about how I got my score after he failed his November test. I sent him all the materials I used and he ended up cheating anyways. What a loser...",

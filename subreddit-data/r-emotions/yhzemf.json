As long as there no pain in doing the job, like constant pain and every inch of my gut brain wanting to deviate at any cost for the task at hand it will work for me. Ive been trying to get adderall, recenly ive been unproductive and down right intensly procastinating, and i, as the self, i dont find really find the shit i distract myself interesting so its just that goddamn gut brain that its against me. I really want it to end, maybe my brain is fried with no dopamine cuz of instagram or masturbation i dont know whats happening to me and why im so broken in that regard. I took acetaminphen because i read it causes emotional bluntness, i think that would beneficial for what im trying to achieve with myself.",

In a simple way it\u2019s a bit like seeing some ripe, sweet fruit high up in a tree, you want the reward but your gut feelings say \u201cThis is dangerous, don\u2019t do it.\u201d So you have to work out the safest way to climb the tree and manage your anxiety.  \nThe answer is never powerful drugs.   \nYou can\u2019t hope to rely on drugs to enable you to cope in stressful situations. You\u2019ll become dependent on them and create far more problems for yourself. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s game.    \n\nSmall amounts of dopamine from nicotine or chocolate rewards is sustainable but trying to release a lot of dopamine all at once is no good.  \nThat\u2019s exactly what heroin does, and it takes a very long time to create more dopamine in the body, so you never get the same result.   \nIt\u2019s just \u2018chasing the dragon\u2019. No good.  \n\nThe only way to manage the stress of jobs like writing papers etc is to learn how to do them well, in small stages, so they\u2019re not scary.  \n\nMake sure you have all the information you need and understand exactly what\u2019s required to get a good grade. Don\u2019t guess, ask.  \n\nThe key is acceptance. Accept that the result you want (to pass with a good grade) will require some effort. But your future self will thank you.  \n\nEveryone who tries to avoid effort in the present looks back later and wishes they\u2019d made more effort back then.   \n\nWrite a rough plan for the paper. Be happy with achieving that step. Take it as proof that you can do this, bit by bit.  Enjoy the feeling of achievement and use that feeling to motivate you to do the next part.  \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure of how to write it ask for help. Other students, your tutor etc. The more information you have the easier it will feel.",

How is \"dont do that, its streefull\" not working against me when back then or my ancestors used to get into all types of dangerous situations and tried new things without that fear? Or how many of the big people in this world have done things by shutting down that gut system or tricking it to not work as intended? How is it that the brain is so outdated that catalogs typing on a keyboard for an extended period of time as \"dangerous\" or \"stressful\".\n\n2. Is not about coping with stress, im not stressed, ME, myself wants to do this, but theres a pushback, for near allmost everything really at this point, theres allways a push back. Theres a total disconnect from emotions and me, my emotions are stuck in past, in the past, sad over outdated things that dont applied to me anymore and that are solved with logical reasoning.\n\nI know you are tired of lisening to me, and of my obstinacy, but please listen to this, even if i dont deserve anything at this point:\n\nI cant accept emotions that have allways lead me to bad situations and bad actions that have caused me a lot of unnesesary suffering. This is not about myself and my emotions being somehow connected, this about my emotions wanting things that will destroy me, that will prevent me for achiving anything. My emotions have allways been like this. Ive allways thought my subsconsious wants to die, some how it hates its own existence, or deducted that it must not exist, i thought it was about purpose, but ive created a purpose for myself, ive given a reason for my existence. But still im alone in all this, with fibers of physical body (my mind, my body, my sexuality) working against me to fullfill some agenda apart for what i want. This has been going on for allmost my entire life, me emotions torture me, made me suffer and make other see me as less.",

Its there anyway to stop caring about things that dont matter?\n\nI dont want relationships with people that dont provide something i can use or something i can do for the person. \n\nI dont want a woman or to build a that type of thing, i dont want to have kids or if i have them give them to someone else i dont know.\n\nAnd this is not because i hate people, its because i want to make my life meaning about helping the colective of my country, of me doing what i have to do to help the mass or create a new autosufficient populace to form and take over the current state of my country. And yeah this crazy, im only going to be playing a part and helping other do this, i have a role. \n\nBut for this i need to focus very hard on the purpose, and to do my agenda to reach my big objectives. The agenda right now has realistic steps nothing crazy. To to do this well i need to make my life only about that agenda (which on its own has a lot of things to do), i canr have actions or sufferings over \"making more friends\" or \"not wanting to do some random shit i have to do i want to do\" or \"no woman \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\". I dont want to be a \"superhuman\" i just want to be rational and do the nessesary things that work and that i have to do for my greater objective, and i only want to do those things, no other things unrelated, i dont want to have the feelings or wanting to those unrelated things, cuz i dont want to work on that, not now that i am not ready or is not the time to handle that. \n\nI want to be a soldier, an instrument of the colective. People do not need to know who i am or praise me or inmortalize me. I dont want attetion, im not doing because of that",

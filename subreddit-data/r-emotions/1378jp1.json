    "postText": "Feeling bored, unfulfilled, feel like something is missing, like I want something more.  \nsomething I need to fill the endless whole in me. I try to fill it in with things like friends and games. But the endless hole never stops. Friends laugh everyday at me and I act like I find it funny. I mentally beat myself everyday changing into someone I cant recognize and someone I don\u2019t like. Barely cry now.",

Remember; it only needs to make sense for you.",

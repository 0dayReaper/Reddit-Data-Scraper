    "postText": "Lately, I've been under a lot of stress because of work. While I'm trying to stay afloat, I still feel that I've been repressing my stress and whenever I let it out, it's usually when I'm angry or irritated. Because of that, it causes arguments and discord between me and my family members. Is it better to just don't show any emotions and repress them? I don't really expect them to adjust to my issues that's why I'm asking this.",

            "comment": "The good thing is that you're aware of your emotions when in stress.\n\nThe thing is, when we're in stress we're actually making too much adrenalin. We are stressing our nervous system, it becomes sensitized and we get irritable.\n\nOne thing that happens is that we loose control over ourself. Actually our human brain (neo cortex) has less control over our mammel brain (limbic system). The mammel brain is the one that has all our values and beliefs, if they are not met we feel emotions. And the mammel brain is 100% sure our values and our beliefs are right. That's why the discussions are more difficult. Now, in stress, you're not able to easily set aside a discussion.\n\nIt's good to be aware that you're more emotional and feel more emotions then usual when you're not stressed.\n\nIt's not that you're not allowed to express your feelings. I usually say: \"I feel more angry/sad/disappointed than I usually am because I have a lot of stress lately.\" Then I go and be mindfull or I do a short meditation to let the feeling go. I think of other things that don't give me emotions or just clear my mind. Clinging to the event/emotion produces adrenalin, so you'll keep stressing yourself. And before you know it you'll be in an endless cycle.\n\nRest enough (mentally and emotionally), eat and drink healthy, exercise your body, be aware when you're making adrenalin, give yourself time to heal from the stress you have put on your nervous system. You're worth it and you'll notice how less angry and irritated you'll be.\n\nGood luck!",

It's hard to be mindful though because I tend to act on my anger first and only after that that I suddenly realize the gravity of my actions. It's like I forgot to be civil (not sure if thats the right term). I forgot to think about the other party first and just express my anger by saying things I don't mean or raising my voice. I'll try my best though. Thanks again \ud83d\ude0a",

The goal is to clear your head when ever you want it to be clear. When you clear your mind your emotions fade away. When you can do this, you will be more in control instead of your emotions.\n\nSit for 5 to 10 minutes and clear your head, do it every day for 2 weeks. If it's hard to clear your mind in the beginning, just count your breaths from 1 to 10 and start with 1 again.\n\nAnd you need to practice being mindful too, just accept the world as it is.\n\nYou can do it! If you practice now, furture you is going to be very happy.",

It's can be hard to find a private place, but if you have one (even in a car works) spent a few minutes yelling about how shitty and stressful things are right now. Really put effort into it. You might cry after, or not, but you'll feel better.",

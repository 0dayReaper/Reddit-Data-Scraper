It\u2019s understandable how you\u2019d feel that way and I know many people feel similarly that are truly deeply attractive people with great qualities to share. Have you explored some of the themes of relationships and emotions to see what you can learn? It might help in the meantime while you continue the search for a partnership that\u2019s a better fit. Diane Poole Heller has some great material as do Gaye and Katie Hendricks. It\u2019s informative stuff that will only improve relationships in the future.",

    "postText": "Sometimes, I cry when someone very close to me dies, but other times I don't. Sometimes I cry at really sad things during movies, but other times I don't. Like, I cried when my dogs died, but not when my grandparents died. I cried when watching Les Miserables, but not when watching the opening scene of Up. \n\nIs there something wrong with me?",

A lot of people don't realise this.\n\nIn Buddhism for example they teach you that you must not clinge to something, because it will cause suffering.\n\nYou can't be responsible for the other persons clinging.\n\nThen there's having expectations, they make you suffer as well. And again, you are not responsible for other peoples expectations.\n\nYes, we do not want to hurt others, but you need a way to show and set your boundaries. Setting your boundaries is allways right, because you're taking care of your own wellbeing.",

            "comment": "Maybe ask a different question.\nWhat  does this person really need?\nAnd once you understand that, you can address the underlying need rather than the emotion.\nIt opens the space to communicate in non threatening way. \nOtherwise every voiced concer sounds like an attack on personality.   \nEmotional attachment is a requirement for a deep , nurturing relationship.  Of course, if it becomes toxic it should be addressed if the relationship is too valuable.  Remember that today Emotional attachment is rare..and most of the people long for it. Hope this helps.",

I can feel my eyes hurting slightly from wanting to push out the tears, but they just won\u2019t flow. I\u2019ve tried thinking about things that usually make me cry, I\u2019ve tried listening to sad music, etc; but nothing is working. Any advice to make yourself cry?",

Forcing your body to express can be more disruptive than helpful and when the feeling is ripe you have best chance of it fully expressing on its own. Second, is that finding someone who can hold you or be with you is super helpful in times like these bc that extra support and connection helps us to let go of that last part that we may be subconsciously holding on to.",

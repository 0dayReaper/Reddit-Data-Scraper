Anger as an emotion is healthy and should be expressed. It\u2019s when the anger becomes out of control and affects other people that it\u2019s a problem. (Eg, so angry at losing an item that you kick the dog.). \n\n\nFor me, I am working on exercising more and journaling/writing to understand where the anger is coming from and why it\u2019s there. Once I understand that, I can release it and move on to happier emotions.",

In the beginning it was hard to cope with her issues, but I learned to manage myself and give myself enough rest so I can be a good partner and take care of her when she needs me.\n\nOne thing I learned about myself this week: I'm doing okay, I'm finally really rid of my burn-out after 3 years. After stressy days I used to need a day to recover.. now a good night of sleep is enough.\n\nMy emotions are at rest \ud83e\udd73 And my needs are just enough filled to feel okay. I'm going to do more about my physical condition.... and I really, really need to quit smoking.",

Rest is on the schedule and though I feel pressured to do something more for the weekend, maybe I just embrace where I\u2019m at and enjoy it.",

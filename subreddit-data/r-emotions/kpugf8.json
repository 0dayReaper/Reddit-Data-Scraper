    "postText": "After multiple deployments I come back cold and dead inside. Fell absolutely in love albeit was so wrong because I was married and did EVERYTHING the wrong way except loving her. Now that I was on the precipice of actually becoming the person I should be, my entire life falls apart. I have went to a deep dark place and becoming that person who had allowed all the damage of their life to consume them. I was absolutely foolish to believe that I could be anymore that cold heartless person.",

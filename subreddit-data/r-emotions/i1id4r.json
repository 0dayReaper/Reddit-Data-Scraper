    "postText": "Perhaps it's a mix. I am looking at the emotion wheel you can see attached. It explains that inadequacy is being insecure and fearful. I looked up the definitions because I am not great at labeling my emotions with all the words.\n\nInsecure means \"uncertain and anxious\" and inadequate means \" unable to deal with something.\"\n\nCombining these leads me to believe something along the lines of inadequacy in this context meaning \"being anxious about an inability to deal with something\" or perhaps \"being uncertain about how to deal with something.\"\n\nThis leads me to believe that I feel inadequate because I am unable to deal with the overbearing grief I feel after talking to an old friend about their experiences.\n\nI thought this was sadness?\n\nEdit: after some more digging, I realize that what I am feeling is actually sorrowful inadequacy. This is the first time that I have linked the same trigger to multiple emotions. Something along the lines of \"a feeling of deep distress caused being unable to deal with disappointment\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46uwg6775ae51.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7e0c5dea72ea096945cb7243521b16e1590ff6b9",

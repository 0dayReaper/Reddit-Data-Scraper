Even if you don't feel happy at first, try and make yourself feel some shred of happiness. Advising this cos I was in the exact same situation a few years ago. Teenage. It feels horrible. But it will get better. Sure enough. Take care. Love you \ud83d\udc95",

That's when you can no longer relate to anyone. Would have been great if you had an understanding parent somewhere but most of us don't. So read up about psychology and don't fight those feelings. You will come out better by the end of them. Fingers crossed!",

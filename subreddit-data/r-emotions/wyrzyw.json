    "postText": "So for a while I have been building a serious hate for Americans.  Just priveleged Americans.  I hate them all and its getting really serious im worried when they eventually enter my country I am going to be a hateful old man.  Im just young at the moment so I want to nip this in the bud before it manifests into something I cant control.",

            "comment": "The first part for me is witnessing and feeling whatever you\u2019re resisting (as much as you can safely manage.) An easy way to do this might be to journal or to talk w someone about it in an authentic way and \u2018get out\u2019 what\u2019s trying to express without being destructive. The second part is being with what you\u2019ve expressed (reviewing) and seeing how you feel. If all you needed was an outburst to express then maybe you\u2019ve overcome it already. If it seems to intensify or last longer, a conversation with a professional Therapist can be incredibly helpful on these types of topics too.",

Though I do think maybe a therapist is a good idea, because I'm getting some quite dark thoughts including anxious thoughts wondering if their culture is going to take over etc.",

Same can be said about many other countries but American media is broadcasted so much more. It\u2019s really cool that you are looking for support and insights in this community to gather yourself for possible next steps. Whatever that may be for you. Consider mental health and good professional support a normal part of being a healthy and balanced individual in this day and age. Nice that you\u2019re being proactive and not just using this rage to project into reactionary actions. The fact that you\u2019re absorbing this much intensity gives you some idea of how \u2018much\u2019 there is to balance out.",

Move your focus to things you can control.\n\nYou can't change the people far beyond your reach. But you can influence people to make the right choices to vote for people that focus on the welfare of all of the American people not just the rich.",

    "postText": "I've been fawning over someone for many years now. We danced back and forth for a very long time before we finally took the dive and started a relationship in full. It was pure bliss. I couldn't get enough of her. Our relationship bloomed more and more before I finally popped the question. She said yes, and even more in love with her I fell. \nIt's a funny thing really. We say our love blooms as a comparison to a flower. What we dont consider in this imagery is the fact that after blooming, flowers wilt. And so, our love started to taper and fade. \nOne day she came home and the realization that she had been cheating became apparent and my world had suddenly been thrown against a wall. \nI couldn't go back to her again. My trust was gone. But, as life does, a curve ball was thrown. She was pregnant. Was the baby mine? Was it his? Do I stay and help raise the kid? Do I run and not look back? A thousand and one questions but none with an answer. \nI stayed. I watched as she ran between me and him for 9 months before she declared one night she was having contractions and she had to go to the hospital. I drove her. Butterflies were in my stomach. Almost 28 hours later the baby was born. Her family was there and so was his his. Mine never showed out of fear the child wasn't mine. \nAfter taking the baby home, I spent night and day taking care of the two of them. The one she'd cheated on me with kept his distance, sharing the same fear as my family. \nThe day the paternity test results came back is still imprinted in my memories, clear as if they'd happened 10 minutes ago. I wasn't the father. \nIt was ok, she said. I'd raised the little one as my own for several months and she'd always be mine in a way. \nWords are pretty, aren't they? We can string them together in unique and mysterious ways to cater to the moment. We invoke so many things with just a few symbols. \nNeedless to say, things never worked out as she promised. Today is Little Bit's 2nd birthday and I didn't get to see her. \nI went up to Walmart and was walking in when it struck me. I've fallen out of love with that woman. I'm not really sure when I did. I just kinda did. Shes been in my life for almost 15 years and up until now, I've always wanted nothing more than to have her in my life. But as revelation struck me walking into a Walmart, I realized it wasn't there. She still runs through my mind randomly, but I dont get the same feelings I had. \nIt's a wierd feeling. Not bad, it just weird. \nI dont really know what I'm going to do with this information yet. Its left me emotionally winded and it's going to take some time to process. I still love the little one as if she were my own, but the cold hard reality of it all is that she isn't. When put in black and white, she has no ties to me besides the bonds that we've made this far in her life. \n\nTLDR: was walking through Walmart parking lot when I realized the woman I've loved for 15 years wasn't the woman i love any more.",

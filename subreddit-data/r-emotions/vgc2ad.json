            "comment": "I really don't know how to feel anymore either. Never have know. Never have known what it is this society wants, never understood what it is human beings so desperately seek from another person, I don't know *WHAT* to say anymore knowing it'll somehow somewhere make someone feel offended, insensitive, or ready to fight. I don't know *HOW* to process how I really feel about things without me making me look bad, look like a monster, look like someone who has no regard for human life. I'm not even in *ANY* position to break down in tears about how I feel about such things because it'll make me a laughing stock, vulnerable, and \"weak\" and just all out unjustified. It's *SO* hard to find a safe place to actually share your thoughts and opinions about *ANY* worldly affair these days without someone wanting to rip you to shreds for it. \n\nI wanna worry about me, I wanna focus on me, I wanna think about what I want for myself going forward, and not figuring out these impossible puzzles that is people. But than I'm somehow somewhere even when doing something as *INNOCENT AND UNHARMFUL* as possible, still in a position where I'll *STILL* be made to look just as worse.\n\nThis world has no idea what they want, this society has no idea what they project onto everyone, and it's all of our faults for that. This society's problem is not everyone else's problem.",

    "postText": "I'm thinking of creating a website that makes you feel something by displaying a different video with music or various audiovisual stimuli that elicits a different emotion each time you visit it. Just a simple and fun thing that challenges you to feel something each day and shift your emotional state, break out of thought loops, etc. The experiences would all be positive, from things that bring joy or awe to things that pull on the heartstrings a bit.\n\nWould you visit a website like this? If you answer no, please let me know why. Thank you!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/zm7mr1)",

I have never been this type of person but I\u2019m just fed up with people talking to me however they wish. I overcame homelessness 2 years ago and I\u2019m still triggered when people look down upon me. I feel like I\u2019m defending myself and I\u2019m telling the world that I matter to and I\u2019m standing my ground!!\n\nIdk. Just needed to vent. I always feel bad afterwards but tbh, I\u2019m more annoyed by the whole day.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for sharing. And awesome vent. Can totally relate! For the sake of your question, anger is not an emotion to avoid but to understand and to integrate into your experience of life. At times, anger is an appropriate response, at times it isn\u2019t. So, learning what constitutes appropriate can help you formulate or reformulate your boundaries. Both homelessness and even having a bad day, can \u2018add up\u2019 to anger bc the repeated emotional experiences of negativity can get stored, accumulating into one big explosion. Best to learn how to release anger in small doses as small occasions add up. That way it doesn\u2019t explode all at once. Not medical advice and specific advice is always best w a supportive therapist.",

For the sake of your question, anger is not an emotion to avoid but to understand and to integrate into your experience of life. At times, anger is an appropriate response, at times it isn\u2019t. So, learning what constitutes appropriate can help you formulate or reformulate your boundaries. Both homelessness and even having a bad day, can \u2018add up\u2019 to anger bc the repeated emotional experiences of negativity can get stored, accumulating into one big explosion. Best to learn how to release anger in small doses as small occasions add up. That way it doesn\u2019t explode all at once. Not medical advice and specific advice is always best w a supportive therapist.",

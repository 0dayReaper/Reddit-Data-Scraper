    "postText": "I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019m nothing but a support for everyone around me. People come and they go without a trace. I help everyone I can. I do everything I can to be useful. However, I feel like a robot. All I ever do is done to benefit others. I\u2019ve never felt like I was doing something to benefit myself. I\u2019m growing tired of this constant state of loneliness. I don\u2019t know what to do to help myself. Am I just here to help others out of their issues? Will I ever meet someone who cares for me the way I care for everyone? What am I? What am I good for?? Why am I still here?!",

            "comment": "The only person you can be sure will be with you every day of your life is you yourself. So it\u2019s worth making friends with yourself and being kind to yourself just as you would want to be kind to your best friend.  \nIt sounds from this short post, as though you\u2019re a highly empathic person and you\u2019ve been defining your self worth by how others receive your kindness and with the hope/expectation of reciprocation and recognition. Unfortunately the dynamic of giving and receiving care is complicated and many of the people who are most \u2018needy\u2019 or open to receiving kindness are themselves not able to return it. Sometimes this is due to their circumstances but sometimes it\u2019s because they are \u2018selfish\u2019, too focused on getting their own needs met to realise that a giver needs kindness too.  \n\nSome very caring people feel that they have to always be showing kindness and giving their time to others because they lack the confidence in their own worth to trust that other people will want their friendship otherwise. This draws them to people who express their needs clearly and strongly, but as I said, these people may not be able to offer real friendship in return. They take what\u2019s offered, for as long as they can, and move on.  \nThe tricky thing is that a \u2018giver\u2019 can look like a capable and self sufficient person, most people are too wrapped up in their own lives to wonder if an apparently \u2018sorted\u2019 person is actually lonely. The sort of person who could offer you real friendship will not be a self absorbed \u2018squeaky wheel\u2019. They may not present the obvious need for help that possibly attracts you to people, which may make them seem \u2018closed\u2019 by comparison. Perhaps look for people who are showing kindness to others, become an ally first, help each other to help the \u2018squeaky wheels\u2019. Don\u2019t assume that you can solve other people\u2019s problems and that they\u2019ll become your best friend as a result, share the load.   \nIn the meantime, practise some self kindness. List your good points and actually say kind things to yourself, about yourself. We\u2019re a species particularly susceptible to suggestion, and what we repeatedly hear affects our beliefs, even if we\u2019re saying it ourselves.",

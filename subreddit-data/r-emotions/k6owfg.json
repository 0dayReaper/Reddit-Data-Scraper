Yet, when going out and seeing acquaintances, I'm shaken by the audacity of a lot of them assuming we're all coming back from vacation and have had an amazing lockdown. I mean if 2020 didn't teach people to think and contemplate before throwing words out of their months, God knows what will. I'm extremely disappointed in people now than I was in the start of this year.",

You're out looking for advice on how to help your friend, you're already doing more than a lot of people would. He's lucky to have you. \n\nAnd remember that you need to take care of yourself before you can help others and you don't really owe anyone anything. Help is given, not traded.\n\nAsk if what you're doing is helping and what he's looking for, you may already be doing more than you think.\n\nI have a lot more to say but my comment was getting very long. DM me if you want to chat about it",

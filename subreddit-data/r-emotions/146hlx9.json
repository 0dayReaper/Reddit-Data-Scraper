    "postText": "I need help.. sometimes my friend messages me these really long messages about how much he hates his life and how everything is so sucky and problems happening with him and how everutbing is just terrible and tonight he was talking about how he is so unable to cry and he hates it and he hates his life and all sorts of things going on. I reallt want to offer support but nothing i say really brings any sort of comfort\u2026 advice isn\u2019t a good idea and i reallt want to be able to take away his pain but there is literally no possible way for me to solve his issues for him. I try to tell him i understand how he is feeling and how he is not alone i\u2019m always hear to listen and i care about him a lot but tthis doesn\u2019t really solve or bring comfort either. i feel guilty like i am a terrible friend for this i just don\u2019t know what to do to help and i\u2019ve tried asking what helps and he says he does not really know\u2026 i tell him i want to comfort him and i need like a guide but he says he is just unable to be comforted i guess. so how do i be a good friend and how do i respond to these long rants?!? i don\u2019t understand what to do",

You're out looking for advice on how to help your friend, you're already doing more than a lot of people would. He's lucky to have you. \n\nAnd remember that you need to take care of yourself before you can help others and you don't really owe anyone anything. Help is given, not traded.\n\nAsk if what you're doing is helping and what he's looking for, you may already be doing more than you think.\n\nI have a lot more to say but my comment was getting very long. DM me if you want to chat about it",

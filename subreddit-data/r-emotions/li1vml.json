    "postText": "Hello, \nI am new here. You can call me Ezra, I was hoping to be able to spread the stories that I write. I write stories when i feel. I dont do it when i feel inspired, though i do have to mention that my stories will be triggering for some people- including suicide and killing- no none of them are actual events that took place it is all FICTION. Each of these stories mean something, but it all depends on who you are. I have my own meaning for each of my stories. I want everyone to have their own meanings. I will be posting one today. Also i have everything written down and recorded on when i wrote these stories and i have proof it's mine so please dont steal them. I hope you like them \ud83d\ude0a",

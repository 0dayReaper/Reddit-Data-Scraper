    "postText": "Just turned 18 recently and battling the idea of finding out what I want to do with my life, been putting all my energy and time into trying to find a sustainable way to make money, and it's stressful. It's every single day, hours on end. I haven't really sat back and thought about life in a few months only been grinding, on the contrary, I'm just ranting a bit to get out some words. Life is beyond beautiful I always forget to stop worrying about my future, my money, and my salary, and just forget to sit back and soak in the idea of life, living, its beautiful. Were all creatures with extreme emotions and egos thinking all right about everything and that we have to live up to a \"standard\", I'm guilty of this myself. I've been thinking I need to have a standard and be successful to prove to my parents and family that I have something going for me, as well as working on my own stuff as I really don't want to work away my life in the future and want to just enjoy life without money being the problem. Ngl I fuckin hate money, I live in Southern California and money is needed here to survive, a lot of it at that. It's really tough I just hate the idea of money and work, I really just want to enjoy a life that dosen't. Nobody really knows the meaning, the purpose, or what good and wrong are, were all just egotistical and belive we have everything right, in reality, were all just some random person to each other and fail to see that. I'm just some random dude on the internet, you're just some random person reading it, the beauty is that tho, we can all make our own purpose. In general, I would say strive to do more good than bad. I also belive its okay to be neutral, what I mean by this is I don't think you HAVE to be good or bad in life, you didn't ask for any of it, however being bad only is not acceptable, why bring down someone else, at the very least be nothing just don't affect anyone life in a negative pattern. I'm just saying random shit, but I'm hoping that I can find some sort of financial success soon in my own efforts and ways. Life is so simple yet complexed and that's the beauty. Love yall, and love each other, or don't Its life I guess",

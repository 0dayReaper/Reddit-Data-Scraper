I don't want to have to wait for them to wake back up. I don't want to grieve for anyone like that. I've had a really shit week. I had to stop a friend of mine from committing suicide. I had panic attacks about starting my A Levels. I realised I didn't actually pick the right A Levels. Realising that my social anxiety is on its way to being chronic. I feel like I'm driving myself insane. I feel like I'm a psychopath but also too much of an empath at the same time. I feel more for fictional, or non human characters than I do real humans. I hate myself. I want to see my grandfather again but my logical brain knows that there is no physical way for an afterlife to exist. I can't see him again. He is gone. In every way. Nothing but ash. Everything I do is so insignificant that I don't understand why I do anything in the first place. I hate existence. There is no point to it. I'm not suicidal, I just hate this mortal coil. I don't want to exist but I don't want to do anything about it. I can't stand it. I don't know what to do. There is so much shit going on in my life and the world, America is on the brink of civil war again, I'm starting a new chapter in my education, COVID is rampant in the UK. Our government are twats. And then there's personal shit that I cba to get into and seems trivial. I may be autistic, I may have adhd. I don't know. I just don't want to feel. I want to be numb. I want something other than death to dull the pain that we know as this plane of being. I'm not asking for help. I just want to vent. If you've read this far, thank you for being bored enough to care about a random Internet stranger's existential crisis",

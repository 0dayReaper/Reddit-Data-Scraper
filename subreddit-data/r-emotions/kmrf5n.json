Thanks",

He needs therapy to deal with it but just the same as a drug addict you can't force him he has to see it. Don't force him just nudge. Forcing wil push him away",

I know his mum was a very strict parent but his life other than that hasn\u2019t been particularly hard I don\u2019t think. Over the last few years especially this year with lockdown I\u2019ve noticed more and more that he can see things that would make most people cry and it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t even notice it\u2019s sad. I\u2019m sure he has some kind of autism but if I leave it at that il never really love him.",

It\u2019s like we are kind of his friends but also he doesn\u2019t really like us that much. I do love him but I don\u2019t feel like we have any relationship. I wish I could know him better but he has an addiction to lying and I don\u2019t think he would ever expose himself. Thanks for responses anyway ^^",

But I don't mean to cross a line but mine was because I was so miserably unhappy in my marriage not that I didn't like my wife the marriage was in shambles. It took an astronomical toll on me. He may be dealing because he wants everyone to have the best life. Sometimes it's a better life without being together. Don't give up on those who you truly love though. All you can do is show them your love but don't lose yourself in it.",

            "comment": "I want to just point out some things that are not really common knowledge, but are helpful:\n\nThe Amygdala is the emotional part of the brain. It is the first to react to the outside world and it can function on its own, without the use of the neocortex, the logical part of the brain. It is the first thing to develop in infants and it has its own storehouse of memories. The linguistic part of the brain exists in the neocortex, which hasn't been developed yet in babies, so babies feel/use emotions as a way of communicating with the world. If babies we not taught to express their emotions healthily during this phase, (by watching the adults around them) the person who experienced it might not have learned how to express them as an adult. Everyone feels emotions constantly, but it's possible that they try to hide them from others, because the behavior they witnessed was imprinted into their emotional preferences, in their Amygdalas. Thankfully, It doesn't mean you can't change, it just takes some effort, which the person may or may not want to work on.\n\nIn children/adults, emotions serve the function of providing us with a working memory, by bonding with certain stimulus, through some sense visual, auditorial, etc; as a way to learn distinctive traits and imprint the value of those things to memory. All working memory comes from emotions and it can be possible that someone can experience 3-5 given emotions at once. People can feel overwhelmed by these emotions, (like taking a drink from a fire hose on full blast) and their bodies cope by shutting the mind down to preserve energy from these high consumption emotions. I don't remember exactly which are the most consuming, but I think fear, anxiety, sadness, joy, anger, and frustration take a lot of energy to sustain over long periods.\n\nI think you are a very thoughtful person to be looking out for your dad, but be careful not to let his lack of emotional expression become a frustration in yourself. Not everyone is perfect at expressing their emotions, but that doesn't mean they don't have them. (Note: it could be possible that they feel different emotional responses to stimuli than you do, they may not have been raised with enough attention to know how to express them properly, or they might just be overwhelmed or frustrated with current events.) \n\nPracticing gratitude and forgiveness have helped me get through some of the disappointment I have felt in my own life. If you practice those things start out small, like minor things that only urk you a little bit. Example: \"I accept my dad for not saying what I wanted him to say.\" \"I have made the same mistakes in my own life, and it's something everyone does.\" Take it slow and keep it relevant to things he actually does and things you are actually upset about.\n\nAlso, there are a few books that talks about emotional intelligence, which has been an invaluable influence in my own life and dealing with my own family. It's called Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman and Social Intelligence also by Daniel Goleman. Thank you for reading this long post and I wish you a lot of luck in dealing with your relationship with you dad!",

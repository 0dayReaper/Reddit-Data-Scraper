    "postText": "Dear everyone,\n\nI (23F) am writing this post because I'm trying to understand the way I feel. And I was wondering if there are other persons like me.\n\nTo summarise it: I have the impression that my emotions tend to be extreme (especially the negative ones, now that I think about it). When something makes me angry or anxious, I have the impression to be overwhelmed by a huge wave of that emotion. I can feel my tears ready to explode, right there, warm under my eyes.\n\nI don't really know how to describe it more, but it is really frustrating because I tend to be easily offended in general, I take a lot of things personally, and therefore, when something happens, very often I feel a sort of huge to cry, and I feel overwhelmed by the emotion.\n\nAs I know that small things make me anxious or angry, I am trying to keep everything to myself and not show anything to people around me. Being like this, it makes me feel like an idiot. And I don't want people to be like \"she's such an idiot to react like this for such a minor thing\".\n\nI would be glad to read what you think about it and also if you have had similar experiences, and how you are dealing/have dealt with it,\n\nHave a nice evening!",

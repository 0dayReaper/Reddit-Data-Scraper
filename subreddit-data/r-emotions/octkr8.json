    "postText": "I know I should figure out why I'm feeling this way, but I honestly have no idea. I have no specific memories from my childhood that would have started this.\n\n  \nI always had this feeling with me though, even when I was very little. It's always accompanied by a very unpleasant physical sensation, sort of like an itch that you can't scratch.  \nI only discovered that it's a feeling quite recently actually, I used to always think it's just a physical sensation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feeling is triggered when I'm losing very rapidly and I can't do anything about it - think situations like:  \nThe enemy is doing a combo on my character, but I can't break it, I can't escape.  \nI tell someone my feelings thinking they'll just respond normally, and then suddenly they invalidate them and are passive-agressive.  \nSome of the situations that evoke this feeling make me non-metaphorically lose my breath, as if I was on a roller coaster.  \n\n\nThe last thing I want to say is that I'm not so sure that this feeling is humiliation. It seems to be connected with surprise, but humiliation is anger + disgust + fear.  \n\n\nThis post is literally like \"has anyone seen my cat? - &lt;picture of cat&gt;\" if you know what I mean.  \nSo, do you have any ideas where my cat has gone?",

If we hold on to expectations we'll feel anger/frustration/surprise and such emotions.\n\nWe *expect* that our values and believes are right and never wrong (also what we believe of ourself). We also *expect* that patterns are always the same.\n\nYou expected that you wouldn't be losing this rapidly.\n\nThe humiliation is purely how you are viewing the situation through your values, beliefs and your patterns. You're judging the situation and not seeing the situation as it is: You're playing a game. Your survival doesn't depend on the game.\n\nTry enjoying the game and company with family/friends, and not to care about winning/losing too much.\n\nExpect less. Look into r/Stoicism.",

(check out the movie the butterfly effect).  \n\n2. reality is exactly what it must be... no one can alter(without a time machine) a single step that has brought all 8 billion of us to this and only this moment... and this has ALWAYS been true no matter what moment of the past you wish to examine. the desire to destroy the past for a better present is irrational and delusional.\n\n3. remaining silent and allowing things to unfold often brings clarity that anger clouds.",

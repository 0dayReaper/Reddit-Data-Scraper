    "postText": "question might sound stupid, but I couldn't find a better way to phrase it.\n\nI finished an apprenticeship as a nurse (not US or UK based), teachers confirmed I passed all exams, but won't disclose the final grades until tomorrow.\n\nOne of the questions during the oral exam was about convincing more people to work in nursing: \u2018pay them more, establish workable ratios,sanction those who don\u2019t follow ratios\u2019 was my reply. My reasons were: it\u2019s a hard job, compensation is not enough, we break our backs and come home in pain, constant stress because you give us too many patients, no time to learn, because there are too many patients. Basically, a ratio and payment question.\n\nThis was exactly what he didn\u2019t want to hear: he wanted me to solve this problem WITHOUT paying employees more and WITHOUT employing more people. \u2018Ridiculous\u2019 I replied. All this is relevant for later.\n\nI thought nothing of it. After all, they wanted to hear my opinion. I gave it to them. Mature people understand the different people have different points of view, right? Well, apparently not:\n\nOn a ceremony with other teachers present, he first congratulated me for passing the apprenticeship and then started to tell me that it could be much better. Well, then why did you and your colleagues passed me? (3 teachers in the panel).\n\nThen he said, \u2018but the things you said... (regarding my ratio and payment question).\n\nHe didn\u2019t finish the sentence.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cause a scene, so I said nothing. But now, I want to cause the scene dammit!! Does he really expect people to mass apply for a hard job with okayish pay? Leave you bubble pal!\n\nWe have a celebration party he is going to attend and I want to go there, confront him and put him in his place. What I want to tell him:\n\n\u2018yesterday you didn\u2019t finish the sentence. What is it you wanted to tell me?\u2019\n\nand when he starts to talk about nursing being a calling, about sacrificing myself for others, that I shouldn\u2019t care about payment, that I should do a manager\u2019s job while receiving regular nurse payment\u2026\n\n\u2018look as%hole, if you so much like working understaffed, underpaid and coming home constantly on pain, feel free to start tomorrow at 6am. But not only one day, but 12 days in a row. And see what happens. Otherwise you are an entitled idiot who talks the talk and doesn\u2019t walk the walk and have no right to tell me how I have to work. Either put up or shut up.\u2019\n\nBut this is futile, because all teachers are going to side with him. They simply protect themselves.\n\nAnd I hate it so much that they can get away giving me the lowest mark for saying truths they don\u2019t want to hear.",

            "comment": "emotions arise from a difference between what you experience as THE REAL WORLD and what you DESIRE/EXPECT the real world to be in its place... hatred is the desire to destroy what is and replace it with what seems better.\n\ncures for hatred may include:\n\n1. understanding that your replacement may actually be worse as unforeseen variables often exist. (check out the movie the butterfly effect).  \n\n2. reality is exactly what it must be... no one can alter(without a time machine) a single step that has brought all 8 billion of us to this and only this moment... and this has ALWAYS been true no matter what moment of the past you wish to examine. the desire to destroy the past for a better present is irrational and delusional.\n\n3. remaining silent and allowing things to unfold often brings clarity that anger clouds.",

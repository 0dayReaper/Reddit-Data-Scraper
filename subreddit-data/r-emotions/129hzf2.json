    "postText": "Let me start this by saying I'm generally an outgoing extrovert. I'm the person that gathers all the friends, hosts fun party's, hiking adventures, small sport events. Things of the sort. \n\nWell, the last 6 months for me has been very hectic (still kind of is) I don't know how to explain it except for this way. I'm not depressed, I'm not unhappy, I just don't feel anything anymore. I couldnt get excited when my son came home with straight A's (which normally I get very excited about and I take him to get a new game or whatever) but the gist being is that I can't feel. Has anyone else experienced this? It's like I'm just going through the motions of my day because I know I have to. I've been eating and sleeping the same but losing a lot of weight (which I can't afford to lose) my face is broken out like a 14 year old child coming into puberty. I know I'm stressed out but jeez...I want to be my fun energetic self again. It's been especially annoying me because I know this isn't me.",

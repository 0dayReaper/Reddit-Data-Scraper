We\u2019re a highly social species and being kind and helpful is so important that it releases dopamine and other feel good chemicals within us. Reciprocity is important too, we want to receive kindness and no love is truly unconditional. It\u2019s ok to be kind and caring but withdraw that kindness if someone is being mean and unfriendly to us in return.   \nHaving aggressive fantasies is not uncommon, especially as violence is heavily promoted by films etc as a solution to problems. How many action \u2018heroes\u2019 do you see choosing kindness over a fight?  \nSave your aggression for self defence, if it\u2019s ever necessary, but remember that actually fighting is just as likely to injure you.",

    "postText": "Context-Couple in Australian workplace sharing same female manager. Weather is autumn.\n\nMy anxiety was heightened throughout the week.  I work together with my partner and we share the same manager. So whenever I'm highly anxious, my startle reflex also intensifies especially when when someone passes by or comes unexpectedly through the doorway. As I was sorting some paper works on one morning at work, our manager came to speak to us. I couldn't hear her footsteps while she came and I had an embarrassing startle response to which we all laughed. \n\nNext thing our manager did was she asked my partner in a loud voice \"Why is she so jumpy always?\" I felt so bad. I mean why would someone ask like why you so depressed or anxious. Also couldn't she use my name to acknowledge me in my presence. \nAfter sometime in the conversation, she again asked my partner \"is she capable of doing *it*(work-related) ?\" \nI felt defeated she was questioning my capability. \n\nOn the other day, I didn't wear a jumper as I have my fan heater on usually and I was also wearing a new dress. It was lovely with Indian prints. This manager came to my seat to have a casual conversation and then under the veil of caring nature, she gave me an oversized company jacket. Although I didn't like, I just wore it for the sake of it. I was drowning in it and looking awful and this new dress was covered.  Last Friday, she wore a similar designed dress with different print from the same store and styled it in the same manner as me.\nI don't know how to feel about it. Definitely didn't feel great.\n\nShe always gives a vibe like she considers my partner highly capable and efficient and me as a buddhu type. \nAll these pent up emotions burst out when I slipped and fell in the workplace while walking. Got a lot of bruises. Cried so much. I think universe has its own way to get everything out.",

    "postText": "I feel like i haven't fully understood myself and I haven't learnt to love myself. I long the feeling of being loved and appreciated yet it feels ever distant. I make so many mistakes and disappoint everyone. I don't really have friends and i feel so alone. I have all this negative thoughts and feelings that I'm trying to get rid of but its hard. It feels like I've lost touch with life. One wrong move and I'm gone. Sinking into this dark empty hole with no room to escape. Is there hope. I don't really know. I think that i deserve love but i don't know if love deserves me. I'm a stranger to my friends and family. I'm becoming more distant and distant. Life isn't really the same. I don't really look forward to life. Everyday feels like the more i disappoint, the more i fear of making more mistakes. I have this fear everyday and it gives me anxiety. The people you love feel so far away and you feel misunderstood.\n\nWhat is love?\nDo i love my self? \nDo i deserve love?\nDoes love deserve me? \nDo people care?\nDoes my father even love me?",

Remember this and follow the trail of peace, forgiveness and joy in whatever small steps you can make. Each one counts and will lead you back to the path intended for you.",

Fuck off! hhahaha I need so some or interaction. I generaly suffer from depression, it has been a year since I have felt bad.\n\nI just woke up feeling like I have given up. I tried to do something to pump me up... I decided to look up my twins that were adopted out years ago! I was very young and the U.S. gov took them from me and sent me back to mexico. I miss my twins so much. Today I tried to call the agency that has them (it was supposed to be an open adoption) But now that agency, I can't find it online, the number doesnt work..... I think I have officially lost my children forever..... this is too much! I feel like I am going to explode! I don't know how to handle this!\n\n'",

I don\u2019t feel happy or excited or anything positive I can\u2019t love or form emotional attachments but it\u2019s weird because I still laugh and smile at things that I think are funny but the emotion isn\u2019t there I can\u2019t feel it. All the good emotions left and all the bad ones stay I still feel fear and sadness and anger and annoyance and to be very honest about my life I\u2019m kind of ok with dying.....I won\u2019t actively try to hurt myself but if I were to find out I was dying I would be ok with it and I don\u2019t know why. I used to be happy I know that much I can remember the feeling of it but I just don\u2019t feel it I haven\u2019t for 2 years and now I\u2019m starting to get concerned about it so please if you know what is wrong with me please tell me.",

I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s something that began maybe two years ago and has continued.\nVitamin B deficiency has been linked to low mood\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/depression/b12-and-depression#risk-factors\n\nYou can get tested for deficiencies, or if that\u2019s too expensive, maybe try a good quality multi vitamin and mineral for a few weeks to see if you notice a change.\nSleep patterns are relevant too, try to get to sleep before midnight. \n\nhttp://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/mood\n\nHydration plays a part too, dehydration is interpreted as a threat by the body and provokes a stress reaction as well as affecting many internal processes.\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/36106-mild-dehydration-triggers-moodiness-fatigue-women.html",

            "comment": "I agree with above comment, good to check if your diet is full in protein and nutrition. I had same problem a few years ago. I was thinking what is wrong with me. Finally my doctor checked my thyroid by doing blood test. I have low thyroid function what really affect mood and emotions, hormones.\n\nSo I would suggest to visit and see the doctor, do blood test and check thyroids. Also provide better diet, make home made smoothies.\n\nIf that won't help, maybe there is some emotional problems. Maybe something happened in your life what made you feel that way.\n\nI don't know you and hard to help based on short post, but def based on my experience I would suggest to check blood and see the doctor.",

    "postText": "This is a rant post about my emotions, advice would help but sympathy would help more. I did not pass one of my tests today and feel extremely depressed about it.\n\nI hate the fact that I am not witty or \"normal\" because people with wit or humour always have it easy, no one can tell them anything while I awkwardly stay there silently while being verbally beaten up and laughed at since they think since I can't have a come back they have won, no just because I can't get my shit together and you all make suicidal does not mean you won.\n\nCouples strive to make me feel more lonely and bad than I already feel. I feel lonely since 4th grade but like-\n\nI do not pass my tests in college and yesterday I have felt extemely depressed\n\nSome people on reddit and quora (made a new account) love to send me hateful messages and tell me how much their trauma is bigger than mine and therefore more important, if I do the same people hate me and bully me and tell me to kill my self and die in bleach.\n\nThe only anime fandom I am in is still toxic and has stupid teenagers that insult anyone who does not ship their ship. yesterday I received messages containing sexual slurs because I did not agree with their opinion and this battle goes on since 2012.\n\nI want to get out of the cycle of abuse and bullying, I am one of the kindest people I know and yet somehow people who are agressive and bad are seen as kind and cool while on the other hand my kindess was always seen as pasivitiy, something to take advatange of and bully me for.\n\nPeople who bullied me for some reason think I deserved it. In reality I was just shy and tried my best to make conversations but did not bother anyone, I was just quiet, mostly draw. Also f sports and everything, I will never get sporty or like them and that does not make me less of a human being, where I live people love sports and I just do not find anything useful about them so they think I am stupid or less than for not liking sports. They also think anime is useless and say it straight to my face but if a popular person liked it they suddenly liked it too\n\nMy mother's cancer is sometimes making me cry, I feel like I can't handle the death of her no matter what\n\nMy father does not have a job and I do not know how we are even surviving or how I will pay for my college, I have thought about youtube but I have been bullied for years(for no reason that I know of) and do not want my ex classmates knowing about my new social media or anything. They are forceful and forced me to tell them my instagram and always asked me personal questions yet never talked to me and made fun of everything i did and imitated me. I have ADHD so I may come off as \"weird\" i hate that term, plus it is subjective. For me enjoying animal and child abuse videos is not fun, it is disgusting, yet my girl classmates laughed at that, read twillight and went to parties every week. It is not me who did not get along with them, some of them did not like me since i did not party (I cannot handle loud noises or blinking lights, it makes me cry) yet they labeled me as weird.\n\nAnd lets not talk about the boys who stalked me, threw things at me and insulted me daily, I have had many experiences of crying i nthe high school toilet and went to the nurse to pass time. When I graduated I did not even want to take a photo with my class and my bullies ruined my prom, on middle school i left on a positive note despite the hostile bullying because i imagined high school as a new beginning but high school was just as hostile.\n\nNow half of my class in college is made of those bad party people(who thankfully do not bully me and just ignore me and pass by me) and I have somewhat conversations with two girls. The only boys in my class are gay or despicable so it is not fun. I have never had romance in my life since I was \"the ugly one\" and i see my classmate who glew up in high school and the female bully leader liked her on facebook and everything. i am jealous of her but oh well. I am not good with make up and not instagram model and people love to remind me of that( that I am ugly because I do not put make up on, cute clothes and do not have large breats and no acne face) (I used to have problem with my hygiene but I was sui\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and actively tried to hurt my self but now I have stopped and actively try to change my bad habits even though I am still abused but less,)\n\nI have been so abused that even slight insult or someone like a stranger or something talking over me and shouting at me is enough to make me cry and crumble down mentally, I have always had this problem and do not know how to handle insults better, first I feel angry then sad, the other day I commented on a photo that \"this is sexual harassment\" and another person wrote to me \"\\*insert sexual slur because this subreddit does not allow sexual slurs\" it made me mad and this happens all the time, i have anger issues and do not know how to deal with it.\n\nThe bullies picked uo quickly on that and made me feel like a wild animal put in a cage (by them) but the cage is also society since I can't express my feeligns as a girl and they were sneaky and they constantly bulllied me and i never wanted to show weakness by slapping them or lashing out but that only encouraged them to terrorize me more until i could not handle it and asked the teacher for help. problem is that i want to do everything on my own and bullying is the type of abuse that i cant handle on my own so unless i hang out with someone scary or big or important people think it is safe ot bully me.\n\nMany redditors have mentioned that if you appear safe, non agressive people are prone to attacking you. I do not know why, it turned out that we are dumb animals that still have the animal in us and would attack anyone who looks vulnerable (I get it, we all have instincts but I was not raised to attack people randomly or take their money just cause they are shy or stutter and it turns out a strong person is someone who can fight but is kind and i hate that since i am kind but cant fight and i am always the weakest link whcih makes me hate my self even more.)\n\nI have went to martial arts but no longer have money or time for that. I do not have psychologist in my college but i have went to one for a few months and it somewhat helped. I still try my best and actually online articles helped a lot but i struggle to put it into practice and when i fail i beat my self and self isolate more (I self isolate since 4th grade since there were no children to hang out with and plus i was bulllied for no reason)\n\nI do not know if life is worth living, I was never the main character of my own fucking life, not even a secondary character, I am someone forgettable in my friend circle that everyone talks over and no one cares about and is invisible but when it comes to abuse I stick out like a sore thumb and am visible to people who take out their insecurities on me and push me around. I hate the anxiety they caused me since it is somehow an invitation for new abusers. Also depression and sui\\*\\*\\*\\*. I am tired of being the friendless, weird, ugly girl, I do not even have glasses to fit the trope but somehow no one has had crush on me or liked me and my friends usuallly come and go and they are usually girls since boys dislike me, I do not know if its my motherly sensitive nature that puts guys off, even as a tomboy they did not accept me.\n\nI am tired of being called overly sensitive and insulted when I am always the one to keep the peace and everything in tact yet somehow no one notices and everyone assumes by default that I am useless because I am weak. I hope they are not right.\n\nPeace.",

You sound alot like my fiancee used to sound, and it breaks my heart. She even has the ADHD and over-sensitivity to stimulation.\n\nI am sorry to hear that your life is so difficult. All I can say is that I promise it will get better. I know you don't want advice, but I highly recommend cutting all of the toxic people out of your life and looking for the rare few good people in the world. That alone has helped my fiancee wonders.\n\nAlso, please reach out to someone any time you feel suicidal. If you want to reach out to an internet stranger, I am here to listen. My father took his life last year and it would mean the world to me if I could help you see that life is worth living.\n\nMy heart goes out to you. I know it's hard right now, but I promise that if you stick it through, it will get better.",

                    "comment": "You can't cut them off if they are your classmates, even if you go to another school it is no guarantee that you won't be bullied again, in college I am glad that those types of toxic party people just ignore me. For them I always inferior and not on their level and I do not understand how being nice is not enough for everyone. It is not logical to not like someone if they are kind to you but no you are harmless and you should be able to make harm in order to be respected, I am tired of people telling me to be nice and continue to be kind despite the abuse since they are never abused and never know what is it like, their kindess is never taken advantage of life mine, plus they have friends and bullies do not attack groups of people. It is not my fault for not being able to fit in. When I see groups of friends in my town i concider cool i become jealous since this could have been my life but my life is bag of shit and every day is a battle to not kill my self. I guess 10th grade was my hardest year since I stopped washing or eating. Now I am better but still cry my self to self and try really hard to not self harm since my bullies have better life than me I could only hope for. I wish I was not born sometimes and do not want to have children since i have encountered many 12-13 trolls. Also do not make promises you can't keep, this may make someone even more suicidal and you do not seem to realize it.",

My father took his life and it affects so many more people than you could ever imagine. \n\nI highly recommend seeking therapy if that is an option where you are in life. Depression is a serious illness and there is no shame in seeking help. \n\nI want you to know that I am glad that you are born. And I am proud of you for fighting the good fight every day. And I meant it when I said that it will get better. I know it's hard to see it right now, but I promise it will. It's going to take work and effort to really focus on yourself. Bullies ignore people with confidence they see it and will latch on to it. \n\nAnd human beings are not logical creatures. They think the are, but truly they work on emotion and then use logic as a way to explain their actions.",

I have been reading articles on how to lift it for 2 years or so and sometimes feel better and sometimes feel like ending it all, it is just that reddit is safe space to rant, if i tell this shit to many people they judge me. I feel like a loser, and the fact that I am a girl is even more horrible because boys usually manage to make 1-2 friends and walk in gangs while it is harder for girls. I also struggle to this day to make friends and am unlikeable altough I am nice, I am concidered boring, it may be my codepency  and poor boundary issues but i am afraid of being bullied again and it makes me want to kill my self as an option for peace because i struggle to find meaning in life and because no one loves me, or calls me and I have been lonely since 4th grade. The fact that i was never invited to parties and birthdays and my bullies wanted me out and celebrated me not being in school and that  i am vulnerable makes me hate my self. I want to love my self but do not know how to deal with my insecurites and project my hate onto the male gender that made me feel undesired as a woman and a girl, ugly, that no one loves me and that I am disgusting, crazy and weird, presumably",

A therapist can help you sift through the many racing thoughts going on in your head. It is really important that you find a therapist that works well for you. I see that the previous one didn't, but I beg of you to keep looking. On top of that, are you medicated for your ADHD? \n\nI am seeing that you have a lot of overlapping issues that all seem to stem from a negative self image. I want you to really understand that I am proud of you for still being here. I was legitimately worried after your last message about suicide. \n\nI want you to  bear with me and try to focus your mind on the positive aspects of your life. \n\n1. You are alive, this alone is so infinitely impossible but yet here you are and that alone is so unfathomably beautiful. You are beautiful. \n2. You are a good person. No matter what anyone tells you, I know this for a fact. Even through all of the abuse, you still want the best for everyone and want everyone to be happy. \n3. You are stronger than you know. It takes strength to keep going, in the face of constant adversity. Especially for a child without a support structure. \n\nAnd one last thing to remember: \nComparison is the thief of joy. Comparing yourself to other people will only make you less happy, period. The only person you should ever compare yourself to is yesterday's you. Work on improving yourself little by little and then in a few years you can see all of the improvements you've made in your life.",

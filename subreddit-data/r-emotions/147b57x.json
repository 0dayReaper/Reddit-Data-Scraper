When someone say something mean I just get all small. How can I stop feeling small? I feel like I\u2019ve avoided speaking up for myself to not get into fights but I can no longer keep my mouth shut. I just need a couple of tips\u2026 or maybe I don\u2019t. I already know what I need to do which is just to speak and tell people to not disrespect me. All in all I just needed to get this out I guess.",

    "postText": "I am not a person who has or prefers a big circle because i always need my own time and space but like i have 3 friends..so i always was happy with them coz as I said i prefer small friend circles ...but recently I have noticed they don't include me in many of their plans ..for example one of these friends of mine got into a good company and threw a small party for celebrating her success but she didn't even invite me ...another of my friend doesn't reply to my text and has unfollowed me on insta after we went to different colleges (i don't know why)..and the last friend of mine is quite nice ..she has recently gotten a bf and sometimes she does ignore me if she is busy with him but I think that is normal and i have no issues with it ...it really hurts me to think that even the few number of people that i thought were my friends have turned their backs on me and now I am left with only 1 friend (maybe)..i am someone who doesn't really \"need\" friends because i do enjoy my own company a lot but are there more people like me who have no friends or is it my only ?..and what do you guys think of people having no friends ?",

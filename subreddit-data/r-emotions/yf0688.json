It's alright because there is a quote: \"the consequence of telling the truth is always the best thing that can happen\". \n\nBecause even if you hide the truth, people will find it out at some point any way. \n\nFor example I'm hiding the fact that I'm depressed from my mate, because I don't know whether he will keep liking me or not. But if I tell him (and regret) before he finds out, and let's say he doesn't want me anymore, then he will leave me right then and there and I will not waste time of my life with him: he would dump me any way when he found out. Or if he did not mind that I'm depressed then he would not mind when he found it out on its own, nor would he mind if I told him before that. \n\nThis is an example to prove the quote. \n\nSo saying the truth always leads to the best outcome. (And you don't waste your time)",

    "postText": "Had this same dream for 3 nights in a row, standing on a field and seeing the mushroom cloud in the distance and seeing the shockwave hastily comings towards me. In a second feeling of complete helplessness, fear of how will it feel to die, though of my ex wife and if she'll survive. Throwing myself flat onto the ground with my fingers in my ears and being consumed by the wave and dying. Then I wake up. But I can't say it is a nightmare, it is not scary, none of my dreams scare me anymore for some reason. I wonder what it means psychologically, because I feel like I have so much unresolved trauma building up that I can't even process emotions or fear, either in real life nor in dreams.",

Sometimes it just takes a few months or years to turn around but life is funny like that. It\u2019s always taking us somewhere. If you can, allow yourself to feel what is safe to feel, learn from your life and you will develop wisdom. If you can bring wisdom and emotional capacity together (rather than indifference) you will have made a big achievement in life that others haven\u2019t.",

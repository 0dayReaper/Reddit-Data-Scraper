I don\u2019t think this is the best way to deal with them yet I don\u2019t know if I can always handle them either. Why do I feel this way? What is the difference between cringey emotions and something that is cheesy? For some reason people seem to like cheesy or bearable emotions more. Please help.",

You really have to dig up information to self educate. So.. don\u2019t feel alone in this bc most people struggle with how to feel, understand and express their emotions.",

If we restrict ourselves willingly, it can also shut down the system and you may have the effects of someone who is traumatized even tho you may not have experienced anything directly. \n\nWhat\u2019s sad is many people shut their systems down step by step, small decision by small decision, over time, bc they don\u2019t have a safe place to feel or express their emotions. Our society def doesn\u2019t encourage this in a healthy way. \n\nSo, for the sake of having some non medical feedback, it would prob be helpful to continue what you\u2019re doing, asking questions and exploring your emotional experience, taking it easy on yourself in terms of judging what comes up, just being curious and creating a safe place to feel whatever it is you feel, and then expressing what you feel is safe in your daily life. This is what\u2019s not taught but is so essential.",

Bring young is rough for sorting these things out because there\u2019s so much pressure of fitting in socially. And we really can be hard on ourselves in judging our experience vs. others and how we \u2018should\u2019 be doing things to fit in. But honestly, being older is just as much with different social scenes and expectations of fitting in. So that\u2019s why age is irrelevant and the core skill here, no matter what age, is to learn to be with ourselves and compassionate with our experience, building safety within our own system first, internally, so we can learn to navigate what\u2019s outside, externally.",

Just deal with it\u201d\r  \nIt\u2019s pretty normal for kids with strict or overbearing parents to develop shame for their emotions- live with the ingrained belief that you need to pass a certain threshold for emotions to be ok. Maybe get punished in some way (verbally? Just get pushed away? Laughed off? totally ignored?) when expressing emotions sometimes\r  \nI guess reacting with cringe/disgust could be an after effect of that\r  \nThough that\u2019s purely my guess. I could be totally off.\r  \n\r  \nand it\u2019s not like it\u2019s necessarily bad. Really, just depends on how you think of it.\r  \n\r  \nthe only thing it means in my books is that it might be a good idea to consider how those feelings might hinder you. Like- if you tend to think your emotions are cringy, you might tend to stuff them down, feel extremely conflicted about yourself and just remain in that pained state till it passes instead of trying to figure out some ways to cope (which would usually take less time).\r  \nthe next step would then be to figure out what ways of coping are you ok with. Or maybe find a place where you\u2019d be ok with venting\u2026 even if it makes you feel like cringe. It lets you practice\r  \n\r  \ndunno, again. I\u2019m guessing.\r  \nFeel totally free to ignore this",

However , something really weird happend many times . every time I show interest in some thing it suddenly become viral in a nonsense way . I will give u an example . I was from the very first fans of a certain kpop bands and almost none of my friends or even people in my cou try know they existed then suddenly bam they became international .ok kpop blew up but there is more I recently started playing chess by recently I mean just two months before the release of the queens gambit show .the weird thing that I searched fora  tv series about chess back thrn and there was very limited unknown ones that no one cared about  but just when I showed interest in chess came out the insanely viral show that made chess o viral and people signing  fir chess sites increased by millions I just canot call it coincidence . even a local tv programne that almost no one watched just after I started liking it by a couple of weeks one the programe clios was edited out of context  and the show went viral because of that  and became one of the most popular shows even though it was the last viewed show ever . I can go on with more crazy stuff like that bit I donot think it is a coincdeince every single time and I feel kinda jelly and annoyed when this happens and I just don't understand why it happens . can anyone relate ?",

I would maybe suggest finding an aesthetic skill or hobby and slowly create things for yourself. That way whatever you create, is only personal, unless you choose to share it. (It won't be easy, but you would be genuine and unique.) \n\nIt also shouldn't be the case that you liking something should draw back your personal experience of the thing. It has taken me a while to learn this lesson, but sharing with others who like what you like is a personal gift to ourselves. Imagine teaching a child in your life, to enjoy the things you do, or you at least share the content with them. You shared something close to you with the next generation!!! That's amazing! \n\nI think if you are able to reframe your thoughts about what makes you unique, you can grow from the disappointment you experience every once in a while, and you cultivate your own personal artworks for your own enjoyment, you will be quite a bit happier! Anyways good luck!",

    "postText": "Most of the time when I laugh I don't feel happy at all. Maybe it's because I have a wack sense of humor because as a kid I never laughed and to make it worse I feel the need to laugh at my friends jokes. I know they're not funny but I don't want them to feel bad so I force myself to laugh. I've been doing it for years. I can't have a meaningful laugh because it feels fake. Also I've developed a problem of laughing at night randomly. It annoys my parents but I can't stop it. At night I just think about the past when things were enjoyable I never realized what I was experiencing until now. I just want to stop fake laughing I want to stay true to myself without making others feel bad.",

I am afraid I don't have any short-term solutions, but it does seem and I could be wrong but that it's difficult to find things you like/love in life. I could be way off and I apologize if I am, but that is the first thing that came into my mind when I read your post.",

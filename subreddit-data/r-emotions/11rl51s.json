    "postText": "For me it\u2019s a rare occurrence to have romantic interest, a crush or even feel attracted to someone else. But I happens, very rarely, it\u2019s always been more of a random very forgettable physical attraction, but this time it\u2019s different. I don\u2019t really know her all that much, but she\u2019s so captivating, I have never felt quite like this before. I find myself thinking about potential dates, happy moments and ways that I could eventually tell her how I feel\u2026 I beat myself down after thinking these things. I can\u2019t be happy, I don\u2019t seem to believe that I can actually pull this off. It\u2019s funny really, I\u2019ve always been so lonely and wanted someone I could give my love to, I even put it on my vision board for this year, but now that im here\u2026 idk what to do, even worst i don\u2019t even think I can be liked by her, I try to look my absolute best every day, I wear my best fitting dresses that hug me in all the right places, twirly skirts and fun colors, meticulous makeup that you could stare at for hours, and yes, she notices and compliments me\u2026 but that\u2019s it. Im so shallow, im so boring and the worst part is that I have every possibility to win, the only problem is me. It\u2019s so rare for me to like someone, it\u2019s even harder to be in love with someone who can love you back, thinks you\u2019re pretty, is in your environment, is available and is actually good looking. Why do I feel so bad about letting someone into my heart. Why does it feel so wrong to let someone have this much influence over your emotions. Why do I feel like if I blow this chance it\u2019ll take me another 20 years to be in this position again.",

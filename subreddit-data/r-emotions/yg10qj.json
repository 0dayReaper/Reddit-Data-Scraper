            "comment": "Agree with the previous comment. It happens to me quite often. Shutting off emotional access is one of the first defense mechanisms of the brain. It usually happens as a result of an intense traumatic experience or prolonged stress. In a way feeling emotions makes you vulnerable, it hurts, it makes you miserable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the correct course of action but maybe it would be a good idea to try questioning yourself about whether you\u2019re \u201cok\u201d with feeling care/attachment/vulnerability around that person at all. If not- what started it? Why do you feel unsafe?\nBeing fully capable to feel emotions when safe (watching movies) is totally normal. Again- it indicates that there\u2019s something about that person or being social in general that creates stress and mild emotional dissociation.\n\nAnother mention- IF that\u2019s what\u2019s actually happening, try to check out if you get any other dissociative symptoms. Has it been harder to focus lately? Your memory suddenly got worse? You forget where you placed your keys etc more often? Do you feel \u201cspacey\u201d at times? Kinda disconnected from what\u2019s happening around you? It can have other implications and is seriously unpleasant if it worsens\u2026 just take care",

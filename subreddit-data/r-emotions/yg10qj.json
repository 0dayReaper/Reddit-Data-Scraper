    "postText": "i don\u2019t know if i care about people or not. when my friend tells me she\u2019s finally gotten with the guy she\u2019s been speaking with for weeks, i don\u2019t care. when someone tells me something tragic about somebody i don\u2019t feel anything. when i ask \u201chow are you?\u201d or say \u201ci love you\u201d i don\u2019t really feel anything. when i think about my family or friends i don\u2019t feel anything. when someone tells me about their day or something that happened to them i don\u2019t care. when my friend told me her pet died i didn\u2019t feel anything. but i\u2019m certain that if my friends or family died i would be crushed. but right now i don\u2019t care. is this how it\u2019s supposed to feel? am i being selfish? i can\u2019t help it. i just can\u2019t bring myself to care. i have to fake reactions so much. sometimes i don\u2019t even have the energy to do that so i just sit and hum as response to what they\u2019re saying. \nis there something wrong with me? i do have empathy, i know that. if i\u2019m watching a movie and someone nice suffers i feel bad. i feel bad about doing pranks. i don\u2019t say whatever i want because i\u2019m afraid i might make people mad or hurt their feelings. i\u2019m so confused, what\u2019s going on?",

            "comment": "Agree with the previous comment. It happens to me quite often. Shutting off emotional access is one of the first defense mechanisms of the brain. It usually happens as a result of an intense traumatic experience or prolonged stress. In a way feeling emotions makes you vulnerable, it hurts, it makes you miserable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the correct course of action but maybe it would be a good idea to try questioning yourself about whether you\u2019re \u201cok\u201d with feeling care/attachment/vulnerability around that person at all. If not- what started it? Why do you feel unsafe?\nBeing fully capable to feel emotions when safe (watching movies) is totally normal. Again- it indicates that there\u2019s something about that person or being social in general that creates stress and mild emotional dissociation.\n\nAnother mention- IF that\u2019s what\u2019s actually happening, try to check out if you get any other dissociative symptoms. Has it been harder to focus lately? Your memory suddenly got worse? You forget where you placed your keys etc more often? Do you feel \u201cspacey\u201d at times? Kinda disconnected from what\u2019s happening around you? It can have other implications and is seriously unpleasant if it worsens\u2026 just take care",

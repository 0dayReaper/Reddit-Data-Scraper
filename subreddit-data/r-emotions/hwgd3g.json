In my honest opinion, everybody should see a therapist at least once in their lives for multiple sessions (even if you don't have any overwhelming issues). In this case I feel like if it goes unaddressed it could worsen. Friends are great, they always want to help and say the right things but nothing compares to seeing a professional.\n\nAlso! \n\nNot every therapist is suitable for you. Don't lump them all together if you have one bad experience. Keep looking for a therapist that has a good rapport with you. It's worth looking for.",

The trick (which is hard) to not feeling alone is sharing yourself with others, it helps you feel connected, makes them trust you can strengthens your relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWaiting for other people to make you feel less alone is a loser's game. You have to act first. You're responsible for your half of the relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherapy is also an amazing way to get expert help on navigating this stuff.",

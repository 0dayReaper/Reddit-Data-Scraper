I\u2019ve gotten rejected several times before, they never said why but I always knew what was my flaw, I jus thought I would try.. is there a trick  to not being scared to be rejected?\n\nLike I said I\u2019m back to job hunting and I went to the companies website and they have a lot of openings for the same kind of position. I already applied to one but my question is: do I leave my one application or should I apply to more at least to be recognized?\n\nPlease pray for me to get job. I didn\u2019t eat today. No money so please pray for me to get this job.",

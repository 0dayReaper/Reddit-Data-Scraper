            "comment": "Sounds you're mentally burned out and very, very stressed.\n\nEvery activity you do in life either stresses you or relaxes you, and there's a big unbalance. When you do stressful activities (physical, mental and/or emotional) you produce the stress hormone cortisol and your body stays in the active mode (fight and flight). When you're in this state for too long you body starts to show all kinds of symptoms of stress. And getting depressed and suicidal are one of those symptoms, besides all the nasty physical symptoms.\n\nSo the big trick is to get yourself into a healthy balanced life. Produce more 'happy' hormones to counter the stress and take more time to relax and rest yourself to recover from stress. And ofcourse reduce the activities that stress you.\n\nI got myself a fitness watch (Garmin, because this function is not behind a paywall) with a stress monitor. It measures your heart rate variability. The higher the better. (Look up HRV to learn more about how it indicates your stress level.) I track my activities and I can see the effect on stress level. I've made a lot of changes in my activities, like intensity and duration... or not do it at all if it stresses me too much.\n\nYou can get out of this! Take care of your health and start doing stuff that relaxes you and makes you happy and fulfilled in your authentic needs.",

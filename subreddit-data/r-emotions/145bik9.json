    "postText": "I m a dr. Will be starting my post graduate in a month or so. I was a bright student. N I was extremely hardworking. But over the past few years many things hv changed. I believe I m losing my intellect. Like I fell so dumb all the time. And even the common sense tasks I feel like wat ???. And it is so silly. I had a bf. We broke up, n m glad we did. He was (is stuill) occupying too much of my brain. I love him don\u2019t get me wrong. But I wanna live myself. Have suicidal Thots. Sometimes. And now like I feel I shud just stop ranting and mention the changes I m going to make to prevent all this. 1) break up. 2) being okay with being dumb. I m no god, I have my limitations and it\u2019s okay. No pressure of being perfect wud rather somehow make me perfect for myself. 3) suicidal thots - nvr after writing this down. (Main reason I m writing this). And academically  and overall energy wise, I m low. I think so. It makes sense to me. And I wanna be a free bird and I will be a free bird. Plus all these are the signs of depression, I know but I know I can deal with it . Just a rant as I said . Probably no one will read dis. And evn if they do, plz don\u2019t be mean. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude05 have a nice day.",

            "comment": "Sounds you're mentally burned out and very, very stressed.\n\nEvery activity you do in life either stresses you or relaxes you, and there's a big unbalance. When you do stressful activities (physical, mental and/or emotional) you produce the stress hormone cortisol and your body stays in the active mode (fight and flight). When you're in this state for too long you body starts to show all kinds of symptoms of stress. And getting depressed and suicidal are one of those symptoms, besides all the nasty physical symptoms.\n\nSo the big trick is to get yourself into a healthy balanced life. Produce more 'happy' hormones to counter the stress and take more time to relax and rest yourself to recover from stress. And ofcourse reduce the activities that stress you.\n\nI got myself a fitness watch (Garmin, because this function is not behind a paywall) with a stress monitor. It measures your heart rate variability. The higher the better. (Look up HRV to learn more about how it indicates your stress level.) I track my activities and I can see the effect on stress level. I've made a lot of changes in my activities, like intensity and duration... or not do it at all if it stresses me too much.\n\nYou can get out of this! Take care of your health and start doing stuff that relaxes you and makes you happy and fulfilled in your authentic needs.",

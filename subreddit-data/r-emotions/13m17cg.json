Perhaps even just one time, when you were expecting it but then it wasn't there like it used to be. So now you seek that attention from everyone. \n\nYou want validation, love, connection, certainty, etc. It's all totally normal, we all want these things. The most important thing to know is that the people in your life still love and care about you, even if they aren't giving you their full attention all the time.",

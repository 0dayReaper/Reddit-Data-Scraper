I don\u2019t want them to have friends or have other people talk to them and I just always get really obsessive over them that it always costs problems with any type of relationships I try to have\u2026 I\u2019ll just get upset if they\u2019re talking to others when I\u2019m around\u2026 Ik this is weird and I really don\u2019t like feeling like this but I can\u2019t help it",

Perhaps even just one time, when you were expecting it but then it wasn't there like it used to be. So now you seek that attention from everyone. \n\nYou want validation, love, connection, certainty, etc. It's all totally normal, we all want these things. The most important thing to know is that the people in your life still love and care about you, even if they aren't giving you their full attention all the time.",

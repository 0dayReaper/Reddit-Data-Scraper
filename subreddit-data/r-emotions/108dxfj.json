    "postText": "I'm currently in my second year of college. I have a lot of friends, which I never had before. Lately, I've felt the need to tell them that I'm weird, strange, not normal. Basically that I will creep them out eventually. I'm not sure what exactly I'm referring to, I just don't fit in, never have. \n\nWhy do I do this? I don't want to lose my friends. But I have this constant need to argue against myself. Why do I feel so weird all the time?",

Or you\u2019ve found the other weirdos who don\u2019t notice.   \nEither way, college is often where people find out about themselves so keep quiet about your self doubts for now, trust that people like you and let yourself change for the better.",

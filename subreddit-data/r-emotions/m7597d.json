I live with my mother and she works half of the month in other city and I am always alone when she\u2019s gone and she started dating someone too. The problem with all this is that she is basically my only company during the pandemic and now with work and new boyfriend she really don\u2019t have time to be home, and that\u2019s fucking ok! But when I start dating someone she get angry because I DON\u2019T GIVE ATTENTION TO FAMILY? wtf she literally leave me alone for months basically... That shit pisses me off u know! My father (who come visit me for the first time in all my 19 years) say that i don\u2019t give attention to him too, but both of them don\u2019t understand that I don\u2019t give attention \u2018cause they never did anything too make our relationship better. Fuck I don\u2019t know what to do anymore...",

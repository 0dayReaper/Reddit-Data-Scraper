It can be so tough but hey, I actually dropped out and everything turned out to be ok. \n\nI know you feel like you don\u2019t have any options but trust me, they\u2019re there beyond all this pressure. It\u2019s just hard to see it when there\u2019s this much pressure on you. \n\nWhat are you doing now?",

They didn\u2019t understand but after I took time off and got my emotional wellness together they started believing in me again. I only went back to school after I was right in the mind and had energy for it. Which was the right move. I did fine after I went back and my life got much better. I guess lesson #1 which is hard sometimes.. but ya gotta put your wellness as top prio. Things straighten out after that.",

In the long-run it wasn\u2019t so bad but it felt like the end of \u2018my\u2019 world while it was happening. Like I said, good things came out of it but I had to put my mental health first and get out of all the pressure. Then I could focus and take small steps into what was right for me.",

            "comment": "Breathe. Focus on it. In through your mouth slowly. Hold it. Out through your mouth slowly and forcefully. Do it a few times. \n\nThat's just to calm your nervous system. \n\nNow for the advice. i refuse to believe that the world is inherently cruel, regardless of what society tries to shove down my throat. I know that are cruel PEOPLE, but not a single one of them sits at my table with me. The people who do, love and support me in every aspect of my life. Anyone else can stand in the kitchen, be a part of the background noise that plays behind the meaningful conversations being had, but they don't sit at my table. \n\nI am a 34 year old single white bisexual mother of 3 boys. I know my privilege, but I do know that I have had to earn just as much of what I have as I've been given through being birthed.\n\nI didn't ask for my skin color, my poverty level, my education, my name. You didn't ask for yours. But you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT change it. You cannot go back and be born somewhere else. You cannot rewind your bloodline and change the pigmentation of your skin. You cannot give your parents more money to have supported you growing up, just like I couldn't for my single white mother of 4. \n\nMy struggles may never have been, nor could I ever assume that they would be, more difficult than yours. But thats not the point. No one should want to gatekeep difficult struggles. Who WANTS to claim the harder life? \n\nWhat we WANT is to prove, that REGARDLESS of where we started (which was OUT of our control), THIS is where we ARE...because of what we've LEARNED to control.\n\nI have NEVER understood how people see people based on their outward appearance, but it's not my job to understand why and how other people react the way they do. I've never been that way, but that doesn't mean i can force others to be like me!\n\nYou can only be, you can only present, you can only exude  EXACTLY what you are. You cannot convince, nor FORCE someone to see what you hope they see. Only they can control their reaction to YOU. And only you can control what they are reacting to. \n\nIt's not okay to be made to feel less than. In any instance! But it is okay to kick people the fuck out of your table if they do. Kick them out of your kitchen. Kick them out of your house. Kick them out of your driveway. Kick them off of your block. \n\nYou are the ONLY person who gets to decide who sits at your table. \n\n\u201cReturning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d   - Loving Your Enemies - Dr King. \n\nSending you lots of love and healing vibes. \u2661\u2661",

The idea of controlling who I interact with (who sits at my table) hadnt crossed my mind before with a small family I think it\u2019s just normal to try to get along. However it goes, \u201cdarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that\u201d really made me think about my identity. I\u2019m a good person because I choose to be, you reminded me of that so for that thanks.",

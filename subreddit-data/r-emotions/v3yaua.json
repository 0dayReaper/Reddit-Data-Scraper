            "comment": "Emotional discomfort is a physical discomfort. It\u2019s the tension and stress that the solar plexus (abdominal brain) causes in certain muscles around our internal organs. When those specific places are stimulated we feel unhappy.   \nOur head brains get the message from the solar plexus saying \u201cPay attention! Bad things happening!\u201d  \nSo the head brain uses it\u2019s imagination to replay whatever\u2019s happened to try to understand it and avoid it.   \nBut repeated replays of the \u2018bad thing\u2019 sends signals back down to the solar plexus which reacts with the bad feelings again, like it\u2019s still happening.   \nRound and round in a feedback loop.  \nUntil we get bored of it, or distracted, or relax those anxious, unhappy muscles around our internal organs.   \nYou know where you feel unhappy/anxious/dread etc. I bet it\u2019s _almost_ exactly where you also feel happy excitement. Maybe a little deeper in.  \nMassage where you feel discomfort. Relax those internal smooth muscles.   \nUnhappy thoughts without unhappy feelings have no power over us.  \nEverything we do is because of how we feel about it.  \nIf you want an expert to do it properly find an Osteopath trained in \u2018Barral Technique visceral manipulation\u2019.",

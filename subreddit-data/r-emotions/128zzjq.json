    "postText": "Hi I (20F) always tend to cry when I get mad. Now I know that it is kind of normal to cry when mad but I have it in an extremely form. When I am just a little mad and I talk about it literally anyone, can even be a stranger, I just break out in tears and am not even to get out words properly. It\u2019s like when I begin to cry I am not able to stop for a long while and I have trouble breathing properly. And here is what is frustrating about it, I am not even that mad or I don\u2019t even care that much and I start to cry. And the annoying thing about it is that people around me think that I am actually sad and not mad, I get comments like ahhww why are you so upset, and ahw we want to help you and why are you sad?? And I am not upset or sad but just angry but I just don\u2019t show it in a way of screaming but in a way that makes me feel like I look a big pathetic, Bc it makes me look like I cry over very small things but in reality it is just that I feel irritated or a little mad.\n\nSo the crying thing is annoying because people get the wrong perceptive of me when I show emotion, and because I often can\u2019t get the words out over all the crying or am not able to express myself properly so I feel unable to really express what I at that moment feel angry/irritated about. And the thing is when I calmed down I consider the situation not even important enough to even address it later.\n\nNext to that, I feel really weak when I start to cry and I really hate it. And that feeling of weakness is usually an extra driver of the crying when it has already started. I normally come across as a very confident person who has a very strong opinion and is extrovert. So when I start to cry it makes me look extra upset Bc of the contrast it has on the rest of my personality.\n\nI post this to ask if anyone can relate and/or has any tips for me to better express myself on how I actually feel instead of being a crying mess, like honestly I would prefer if I would just shout or anything like normal people when they are angry\u2026\n\nSide note: I did not have a childhood where I learned how to properly express emotions and I had a mom who did get angry A LOT it the conventional way, so I always really dislike it when people are being angry and in that way often hurtful to people, so maybe it is a bit of a childhood trauma but I would still really like to be done with the crying while angry",

            "comment": "First of all, you're actually very emotionally aware and have basically already identified why this happens to you, so congrats on your ability to describe the situation, even though it may not feel like a success right now. Basically what's going on is called an entanglement. You've entangled feeling one emotion and expressing another. In this case, when you're in a state of anger you've habituated communicating sadness. You say it yourself in the 4th sentence, your breathing is a huge factor. Pay attention to your breath next time this happens, see if you can keep it steady. You can also try to keep your eyes above the horizon line, don't let them drop down.",

            "comment": "coming from a transactional analysis background, I am used to dividing a single person into three internal people known as the parent adult and child... these 3 ego states can operate nearly independently and argue amongst themselves... in your case, I see your adult mind, what you might think of as your conscious soul self,  being in conflict with your inner child self... who exists only in emotions... frustration and sadness and acts out in such a way as to dominate your entire being at times... you can communicate adult mind to this child self but it does not communicate back to you in words, just feelings which dominate your body and makes your adult like a rider holding on for itself life and without being able to control where you are headed... am I close?\n\nif I am, you can learn techniques to bring back a measure of control sooner rather than later...\n\none such technique is to simply name what you see... just look around and name things.  this will force you back to the present, where your adult mind naturally dwells... the child has deep roots in the past and is weaker in the present... when you feel settled into the present, you can do an immediate inventory... anything necessary to prevent pain or injury right this moment? usually no... then you can just switch to a more conventional way of dealing with the world\n\nlearning breath work helps too... breathe in short and fast, through the nose, then breathe out slow like you were using a straw, through the mouth... this calms the entire body down.",

            "comment": "First of all, you're actually very emotionally aware and have basically already identified why this happens to you, so congrats on your ability to describe the situation, even though it may not feel like a success right now. Basically what's going on is called an entanglement. You've entangled feeling one emotion and expressing another. In this case, when you're in a state of anger you've habituated communicating sadness. You say it yourself in the 4th sentence, your breathing is a huge factor. Pay attention to your breath next time this happens, see if you can keep it steady. You can also try to keep your eyes above the horizon line, don't let them drop down.",

            "comment": "coming from a transactional analysis background, I am used to dividing a single person into three internal people known as the parent adult and child... these 3 ego states can operate nearly independently and argue amongst themselves... in your case, I see your adult mind, what you might think of as your conscious soul self,  being in conflict with your inner child self... who exists only in emotions... frustration and sadness and acts out in such a way as to dominate your entire being at times... you can communicate adult mind to this child self but it does not communicate back to you in words, just feelings which dominate your body and makes your adult like a rider holding on for itself life and without being able to control where you are headed... am I close?\n\nif I am, you can learn techniques to bring back a measure of control sooner rather than later...\n\none such technique is to simply name what you see... just look around and name things.  this will force you back to the present, where your adult mind naturally dwells... the child has deep roots in the past and is weaker in the present... when you feel settled into the present, you can do an immediate inventory... anything necessary to prevent pain or injury right this moment? usually no... then you can just switch to a more conventional way of dealing with the world\n\nlearning breath work helps too... breathe in short and fast, through the nose, then breathe out slow like you were using a straw, through the mouth... this calms the entire body down.",

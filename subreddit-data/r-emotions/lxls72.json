    "postText": "\nYou could feel it in your bones as the hair on your body stood up, like loyal soldiers trying to shield you from the onslaught that\u2019s coming your way. \nBut little did they know the enemy isn\u2019t on the outside but very cleverly resides well within. \nHidden beneath the layers of the many facades you put on for those who look. \nIt knows you, feels you and feeds on your vulnerabilities. It doesn\u2019t just look, it sees you. \nIt Devours you till you start to decay. \nYet It never starves. \nBecause you Feel.\nYou feel everything all too much even when you shouldn\u2019t. The constant need to pretend because otherwise being you is too exhausting. The disappointment when you can\u2019t keep up. The heartbreak when you aren\u2019t good enough. And yet you continue to feel.\nBecause You crave it.\nYou crave The pain the emotions the trauma. You survive on it. Even when all you want is something ordinary. But it never lets you settle for what you want. It plays tricks on your mind, shows you what you crave, what you need, all the while carving you from the inside out. You bleed from a thousand needle pricks. Slowly yet constantly. \nThe pain intensifies And yet \nyou don\u2019t try to stop the bleeding\nBecause in that moment you feel \nAnd it continues to feed \nAnd together You revel in it! \n- ala Folie",

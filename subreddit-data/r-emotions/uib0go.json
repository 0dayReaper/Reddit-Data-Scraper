    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019m super bad with understanding myself and my emotions due to well trauma lol. And like so I\u2019m currently in a situation where I don\u2019t know at all what\u2019s good for me or what I should to go forward at all. If anyone could give advice it would be much appreciated. I\u2019m currently living with my bf in an area I absolutely despise. I\u2019m in the process of getting my license and finishing up my associates at my current school. But I\u2019m gonna need to be on campus for my classes or at least drive to campus for my classes. That and like where I\u2019m at is a hour or so away. That and I wanna move but also it\u2019s hard for me to just move since the only family I have is incredibly toxic and wouldn\u2019t end well. My bf wants to talk about me staying so he can stay in his apartment so he can afford it but I don\u2019t know if I can survive another year here I don\u2019t know. Can anyone give advice?",

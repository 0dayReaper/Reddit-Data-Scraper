    "postText": "I take a breath, but the air doesn\u2019t feel refreshing or relieving. \nInstead it feels like acid, burning its way through my lungs, hot, painful\nIt makes my insides shrivel up, crawling decrepitly away from the one thing that should bring relief but repeatedly fails to do so. \nMy body stiffens, tenses, hardens, waiting for what feature of physical symptom of this disease will come next\nBecause that\u2019s what this is right? \nA disease, an abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of us. \nNot hell. Not some form of purgatory. Not being burned alive. \nIt\u2019s a panic attack. Anxiety. All consuming and fierce. \nAnxiety.",

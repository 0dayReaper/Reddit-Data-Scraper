It's probably sad because some of your innocence is lost in the mix but its nothing to fear and nothing to feel bad about at all.",

I can remember when I was 11 counting down the days till Christmas and my Birthday every year prior and being super excited about all these things but Christmas came and went for me this year my birthdays somthing i no longer look forward to because now im just getting old lol im only 27 but its just a different mind set and understanding. I can remeber when i turned 13 i no longer counted the days till Christmas i counted the days till i could get my drivers lisence and then counted the days till i graduated highschool and left my hometown for good. Its stuff like that that becomes more important maybe not those exact things of course but thats just my experience.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for having the courage to share and great question! Yes it\u2019s normal. When we come into restful states, the intelligence of our system has an opportunity to surface its concerns. Be grateful, because that means your body is communicating with you. The needs of significance, contribution, variety, everything that you\u2019ve explained are totally normal, and desires of all humans. More than desire, actual needs, motivations and natural impulses. As far as the question, why do they all pile up at once, it\u2019s pretty simple. When our needs are not met in a short term, our system is still moving forward, tending to life and its details. But when things aren\u2019t met, needs aren\u2019t met for prolonged periods of time, our system asked to speak up to remind us of its needs. Take some time, if you want to practice, and list out ways that you can bring more of these needs into your life. It\u2019ll ease your system to know that you\u2019re working on it. And you might just find practical ways to begin filling some of these tanks, even in small parts. Hope that helps!",

    "postText": "I usually feel fine emotionally, but then there are some nights where I just kinda get hit with these certain emotions and it\u2019s what I kinda dwell on that night. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been unintentionally holding them back and then they get released. Sometimes is sadness, or longing, loneliness, unworthiness, etc. For example, this is what I experienced tonight.\n\n\u201cI want to be unique. I want to have that thing that makes me who I am, that makes me standout for some reason. I feel as though I\u2019m uninteresting. I have no remarkable features. I have no great talent. I feel like my experiences are lacking. Like I haven\u2019t done this great triumphant thing, or I haven\u2019t experienced an awful trauma. I feel as if I have nothing unique. What do I have to give. Who am I to others. How do they perceive me, if they even do. It\u2019s not insecurity that makes me wonder what I look like to others. It\u2019s a want to know what others think I am so I too can know who I am. What is it they notice about me that makes me, me. There are things I don\u2019t know that I do cause I can\u2019t view myself from someone else\u2019s lens. I so badly want to be a different person so I can view myself and see who I am\u201d\n\nIs it normal to just have nights like this where things just kinda come out?",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for having the courage to share and great question! Yes it\u2019s normal. When we come into restful states, the intelligence of our system has an opportunity to surface its concerns. Be grateful, because that means your body is communicating with you. The needs of significance, contribution, variety, everything that you\u2019ve explained are totally normal, and desires of all humans. More than desire, actual needs, motivations and natural impulses. As far as the question, why do they all pile up at once, it\u2019s pretty simple. When our needs are not met in a short term, our system is still moving forward, tending to life and its details. But when things aren\u2019t met, needs aren\u2019t met for prolonged periods of time, our system asked to speak up to remind us of its needs. Take some time, if you want to practice, and list out ways that you can bring more of these needs into your life. It\u2019ll ease your system to know that you\u2019re working on it. And you might just find practical ways to begin filling some of these tanks, even in small parts. Hope that helps!",

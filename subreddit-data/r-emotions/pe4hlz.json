We don't shout every time something sad happens to us, only when it is sad **and** unexpected. To be calmer, we must, therefore, learn to expect far less from life. Of course our loved ones will disappoint us, naturally our colleagues will fail us, invariably our friends will lie to us.. None of this should be a surprise. It may make us sad. It must never - if we are Stoics - make us angry.'\n\nI made this choice a long time ago. The only times I did get angry was when I have stress. (That's an indicator for me to take some days off and rest.)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m constantly trying to seek my bestf\u2019s (let\u2019s call them T) validation. T is a reserved person who doesn\u2019t talk a lot (so reserved that they won\u2019t even tell me the colour they like). \n\nI was walking with T and another friend, when came Y, a friend we\u2019ve known for a few months now. When T saw Y, they were like \u201cI\u2019m sooo happy to see you\u201d , \u201cI was disappointed when I thought that you weren\u2019t here but I\u2019m so glad now\u201d. \n\nI haven\u2019t been meeting my friends everyday, so I don\u2019t really know what happens when I\u2019m out there. When I visited  them after a long time, my friends were saying that \u201cwe\u2019re so shocked to see T talk so much with Y, because they barely talk to anyone.\u201d \nThat kind of made me sad, because I really want T to talk to me, but they barely do. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve been trying to do for 2 years, Y did that in a few months. I\u2019m just really confused at this point. A part of me wants to change completely into a person that T would admire, and the other part of me is like \u201cduh that\u2019s too much effort, people should like you for who you are, don\u2019t change yourself\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m feeling threatened, jealous or insecure. Any insights would be highly helpful.",

I wouldn\u2019t open up to a random person, or a person I don\u2019t feel like opening up to either, so I shouldn\u2019t wait for that to happen. Thank you so much , this helped in understanding a lot of things.",

            "comment": "The driving emotion is maybe loneliness. Since the main issue is craving connection with T.\n\nThe fact that T is your focus indicates that you've attributed some value to their person that you feel you are otherwise lacking. That's feeling enamored maybe? Enamorment is a great emotion. It feels full of hope and joy. Often it carries notes of wonder aswell!\n\n...but being unusually enamored... especially when the other person remains reserved.... might hint at some insecurity within yourself too.\n\nContniuing to crave that closeness with T when it's not freely given could permanently damage trust/respect between you and them. Having to act differently than you want to, causes internal conflict within yourself.  It's like you're litterally pulling in two directions and tearing yourself up.\n\nThat could very easily drive your unresolved attraction to increase and pull a myriad of other negative emotions. Like a like snowball cycle of depression,  self-loating, anxiety.... and more loneliness. No bueno!\n\nWhen I find myself nurturing \"seemingly\" illogical attraction for someone that's not interested.... it usually means I'm idealizing them. Likely because I'm desperate to fill a perceived lack in my life. So really.... the feelings are logical! Just misplaced. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMaybe spend some time identifying and characterizing the pull factors of T?  That should enlighten you on some less obvious personal qualities and emotions.... maybe even an unprocessed experience from your past.",

    "postText": "So I'm involved with someone we're not serious but I do kinda feel more seriously about them than they do me. I've only been seeing them for 2 months. They mentioned that someone that they use to see in the past asked them to hang out.. Although I kept it to myself and didnt show it.. i overeacted to myself and started to feel insecure, jealous, and felt like im too attached. Why am I like this?\n \nIdk how relevant this would be but way back in kindergarten I remember having a crush on a boy and then one day he had given a rose to a girl. I got really jealous.. This according to my mom. \nI guess ive always got like this with people I like that wasnt serious but I took it top serious",

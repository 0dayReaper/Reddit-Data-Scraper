    "postText": "Ive noticed nearly all my life I couldn't really stand up for myself during confrontation. When there was times to address certain matters that I needed to speak on I couldn't because I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I will cry and shutdown rather then defending myself on a certain matter with friends, family or strangers. And I know being in this world it will be times of confrontation that will maybe lead to arguments that I will need to addressed and I can't just cry and shutdown. Is it a term for this? How should I solve this moving forward?",

Maybe if you try when you feel safe, and establish trust in your ability to communicate clearly (let\u2019s say 2 days after the event) and continue practicing, maybe you build capacity to communicate within a shorter timeline, up until the event itself. Whatever you can do to increase your ability to be present (meditation, etc.) and communicate boundaries can also be helpful in building capacity. Good luck and keep us posted!",

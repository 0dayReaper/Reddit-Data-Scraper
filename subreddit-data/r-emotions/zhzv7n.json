Maybe if you try when you feel safe, and establish trust in your ability to communicate clearly (let\u2019s say 2 days after the event) and continue practicing, maybe you build capacity to communicate within a shorter timeline, up until the event itself. Whatever you can do to increase your ability to be present (meditation, etc.) and communicate boundaries can also be helpful in building capacity. Good luck and keep us posted!",

    "postText": "It feels like actual pain. I can feel it, see it, it ignites inside my body, in my chest and abdomen.  I suffer with self harm but when I choose not to act on it, going through the pain with no release is feeling ACTUAL pain. Explaining how it feels does not project correctly, and direct correlations as to why and where it came from dissolve into the air and becomes a fog  layered so thick it surrounds me making me invisible. It is awful, it is hell, it is inescapable, it is pure evil because I know I was not the one that put this ability inside my head. Oh it grows, it becomes strong, it breaks the hinges and locks I bolted to the frame. My entire body tightens with such intensity my breath quivers and I'm shaking, sweating, begging myself to stop the pain, the hate, the purest form of fear and confusion. I can't talk or move, I'm paralyzed and numb and it HURTS, it hurts so so much. No i do not know what to do because I will disappoint everyone. How can I feel better when I have cried wolf too many times? when the patience is thin? when I grab the life preserver but theres no one there to pull the string or help me on board? Im at the beginning again it feels every time I let this pain take me. No one wants to play a game with someone who wants to restart every time they roll the wrong number, gets stuck until a 3 or 5 sets them free or picks the card that sends them straight to jail. Will you ever be ready player 1?",

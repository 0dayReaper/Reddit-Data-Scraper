            "comment": "There are 3 different types of tears. 1 lubricates the eyes, 1 cleans the eyes, and the other (emotional tears) has a pain killer in it. The purpose of emotional tears and the emotion sadness, is to help the body and brain disassociate its neuro-pathways from attachment to something or someone.\n\nIf you are coping with loss from something in your life, then crying is a great way for you to ease your pain, readjust your mind towards the loss you are experiencing, and deal with future disappointment and anger caused by the loss of the thing. \n\nIf you don't give yourself time to cry, or if you try to convince yourself that you are capable of distracting yourself with the emotion joyfulness (the brains way to form attachment to things), then you will just keep those neuro-pathways strongly bonded, and cause yourself future pain. \n\nMy advice is to do what you were doing and keep crying. It can be useful, but not always helpful, and it will make you a healthier person.\n\nAlso there is a Buddhist saying, \"romancing sadness only brings it closer to the heart-mind.\" Meaning, probably be aware of when you're in the healthiest mindset to move on. Good luck!",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t know why but for whatever reason sometimes when I am confronted by what I want in life (especially having to do with relationships and girls) I seem to freeze up. I keep overthinking my interactions with girls mainly that I am attracted to and I am sick of myself doing that. I sabotage almost every single opportunity trying to hold onto what little ones I have. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. I have zoomed in on what I am grateful for for too long that now it\u2019s like I take for granted what I want to go after and incorporate what I want in my life. It\u2019s really annoying. How do I shut down the judgement and over analysis of the opportunities where I really want to branch out and talk to someone but I don\u2019t just because I am afraid? \n\nTLDR: How do I approach more girls after dealing with deep depression, habitual burnout, telling myself that it\u2019s not worth it, being in denial and being so afraid of something going wrong?",

            "comment": "Break down your process of learning emotions into 3 areas - psychological, physical, communicative.   \n\n\nPsychological is the mental or cognitive sensation and experience of emotions and their relationship to external or internal stimuli . \"I feel sad because of x\"  \n\n\nPhysical is the relationship between mental experience and physical response. \"I feel sad so it's making me cry\" or sometimes \"I cant stop crying and that's making me angry\". Mental and Physical inform each other both way  \n\n\nCommunicative is the awareness of the way you broadcast and receive emotional communication to and from others. Our emotions were here before we developed the ability to speak. They are our first, and in many ways still our primary form of communication. Communicative area of emotions encompasses how emotionally reactive we are, or how well we're able to mask our emotions for the sake of limiting communication. Some of us are very sensitive to the emotional communication of other, some of us are completely unaware when others are emotional states, even if they are heightened levels of that emotional state.   \n\n\nThe best way to understand the psychological aspect is by learning about psychology, behavior, and by talking with therapists that are amazing at helping people figure this out about themselves.   \n\n\nThe best way to understand the physical aspect is the Alba Method, it very systematically leads you through the physiology of basic emotions and physical response.  \n\n\nThere are several ways of understanding emotional communication, and I think it starts with making the choice to pay attention to other people when you interact with them. Look at their eyes, look at their facial expressions. Look at the posture to see if they are tense or relaxed. Listen to their voice to hear if it's steady or shaky. There are so many qualities to pay attention to in other people and yourself to gain more awareness of communication.  \n\n\nGive yourself time and never stop learning!",

I never had a dad growing up so that might be the reason and when I thought deep about it I haven\u2019t really been able to release my emotions since he passed. I still have my mom and friends that I know I can talk to but bottling it has become my second nature and that part of me doesn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s help or anyone to know but deep down I want to tell someone I usually just decide against it",

But an essential part of being human is connecting with other people and giving and receiving empathy. Listening, and being heard. \n\nWe all have an instinctive, natural need for it, which goes all the way back through our specie\u2019s time on earth. It makes us feel wanted and accepted. If you don\u2019t share your feelings with anyone you cut yourself off from that real connection and you suffer. \n\nYour anger is what happens when you clamp down on your sadness and grief. There has to be an outlet eventually, and anger is \u2018safer\u2019 because it\u2019s \u2018strong\u2019 not \u2018weak\u2019. But anger becomes destructive, and can push people away. And it\u2019s still not an honest expression of your other feelings, so it doesn\u2019t help with communication. You really need to find someone, either in your family or a good friend, or a therapist, who is willing to listen to how you feel, and really hear you. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to cry when you think of things that hurt you. Crying is a release of stress chemicals and a signal to friends that you need a hug. You need at least one friend who will hug you when you\u2019re sad.",

If she has a tendency to avoid properly listening and turning the conversation around to be about her feelings then that\u2019s a pattern you need to address. It may be that she doesn\u2019t really know what to do, so she deflects, or it may be that she\u2019s a bit selfish. I don\u2019t know. I recommend you look into \u2018non violent communication\u2019 developed by Marshall Rosenberg, there\u2019s lots of videos online. It\u2019s a way of defining what\u2019s really important and communicating with family and anyone else in a way that gets to the important stuff without arguments or deflection. I\u2019d also suggest you look at \u2018Human Givens\u2019 therapy as a way of understanding human needs and how stress and anger affects us and how to let go of it. \nYou could start here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VT8KGgDo6TY\n\nAnd here:\n\nhttps://www.humangivens.com/human-givens/human-givens-therapy/hg-approach-difference/\n\nThere\u2019s not going to be an instant \u2018magic button\u2019 cure, but hopefully with better understanding and some useful tools you can express your feelings in a healthier way and open yourself up to more happiness.",

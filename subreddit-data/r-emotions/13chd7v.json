    "postText": "My mum's dog ripped up some of my drawings that were sitting at the wall side of my table. I got really upset, more upset than when he rips up my other things. It's weird to get upset about such a little thing. I was saving them up to post and hadn't taken pictures yet. My drawings will usually envoke some emotions in me so I suppose I'm emotionally attached. I won't usually cry in front of my mum but I did about the drawings. I really appreciate them, I guess I can just draw more. It's not like they too a lot of time either. Maybe 10-40 minutes.",

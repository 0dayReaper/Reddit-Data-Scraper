You don't deny your baggage, you truly accept it, and by truly accepting it, rationalizing it, it will dissolve into your whole self.",

One thing I\u2019ve noticed is greater awareness of what\u2019s going on in my emotional world, and understanding what the next correct step would be. Sometimes understanding that I don\u2019t know yet.",

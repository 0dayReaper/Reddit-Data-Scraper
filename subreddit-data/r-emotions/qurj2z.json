    "postText": "recently my life has been spiralling downhill, my friends have been shit to me, a girl i had a thing with had to end stuff with me for mental health reasons (not cos i was bad to her but she couldnt be in a relationship rn) and that reminded me of my ex which noe has a gf, im broke and im doing shit in school, i have an addiction to smoking cigarettes and i have no hobbies that interest me anymore. \n\neveryday i go to school, barely interact with my classmates and then i go home, go on a 2 hr walk, stay home for an hour and then go on a walk and repeat that until the day ends. everyday. im just beginning to feel empty and ive lost all purpose to life. everyone around me seems so happy but have no regard towards hoe im feeling - which ig they dont have to but it would be nice for someone to care yk. i just miss how life was a few months ago.\n\nim not sure why i wrote all this but who cares. ive been feeling as if my life is just a repeat and all the days are merging into one, i have no purpose, no meaning to my life, no goals and no motivation. i want to be happier but ive not got the motivation to be happier, whats pushing me to be happier? the constant plunge further and further into seld destruction everyday? ive been thinking about ending it - and yes i know, dont make a long term decision for a short term feeling, but who knows how long im gonna be feeling like this and who knows how many bad things are gonna come up in this domino like rotation. \n\nidk i needed somewhere to say all this before i ultimately make my decision. who knows, this could turn out to be some kind of suicide note, or it could turn out to be a post that i come back to in 10 years to laugh at. ig we just have to wait and see.",

Things improved a great deal when I was 22 and I kinda found myself and have been pretty happy much of the time since then.  If you told me when I was 21 that I would be happy later in my life I wouldn't have believed you; it felt like it was all downhill and there were no bright spots, but things can change.  I met an African medicine man who changed my life; he taught me how to pray to the ancestors for guidance - this is a practice I strongly recommend if you feel drawn to it.  Basically you call on all the ancestors of yours, mainly those who lived exemplary lives, and pray for their guidance.  It's amazing what the ancestors can show you- they can help you find guidance and help you find a fulfilling life path.  The ancestors led me to Buddhism through a mystical experience and I've found a lot of fulfillment in Buddhist practice since then.  We are all connected to our ancestors, which include our grandparents, deceased parents, and ancestors many generations past; when we call to them they can make themselves known in our life and can guide us to a more fulfilling life.  Many tribes of Africa, and especially the tribes of West Africa that I'm familiar with, know the power of the ancestors; they carry more love for us that we can imagine.",

Save that for when you\u2019ve got serious problems like you\u2019ve accidentally killed a child.  \nNot to downplay your present feelings but you need a sense of proportion. You were much happier a while back, so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be happy again in future.  \nFeelings come and go. Stick with it, don\u2019t try to hide from the low you\u2019re in right now with drugs/alcohol etc, nicotine is ok, it releases a little dopamine which keeps you going, but look for organic tobacco like Pueblo or American Spirit to avoid the cancer causing polonium 210 in other tobaccos.  \n\nAccept this as a passing phase and sooner or later you\u2019ll get bored with being down and let yourself enjoy life a bit more.  \nBeing single when you want to be in a relationship sucks, we\u2019re a social species after all, but list your good points, be kind to yourself, you are the only person who will be with you every day of your life, so you may as well be best friends with yourself.  \nAnd look for opportunities to be kind to others, not only does it take your mind off your own issues but it makes you much more likeable and attractive to other people.  \nAll the best, good luck on the up!",

School is dumb and I hate how you have to go to school to get a good job and going out every day is such a struggle, I actually don\u2019t even go out most of the week. I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life and just going on feels like a struggle and too much work, and for some reason I am still here doing the same old shit. Idk tho i think we got this tho, I mean I was happy once and you said you were too, I\u2019m sure we can do this, and although I\u2019m saying these words trying to be positive it\u2019s hard to believe what I\u2019m actually saying. I see people being happy and I guess that could happen for us also I guess it just takes lots time to feel better",

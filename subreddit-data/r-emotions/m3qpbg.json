    "postText": "This happened today I recently finished my lease last month and I was awaiting to receive my deposit back. I got a called from my grandmother telling me I had a letter. I told my uncle to open it and tell me what it is. (Grandmother going on 90 and eyesight not that good) All he said was it 615 I was like oh must be my deposit I said. Ill be down to get it. I arrived at my grandmother house got the mail then she said you have another letter. I open the newest one reading then my mouth dropped the I saw red and be annoyed.\ud83d\ude12 If you guess the the letter was from a debt collector then you would be right.  I then open. The other letter to see i was being changed for a few more things like blinds and admin fee, at the bottom was the water bill 1011. I was pissed because I pay my bill on time/a head of time. So I went up there to talk to her but of course she wasn't there \ud83d\ude43 . Great....... so I talked to the lady that was there she asked to she the paper and said that she couldn't do anything for me but asked to make a copy to show the owner who would return on Monday. I told her if I did something of course I wouldn't mind paying but I'm not going pay that because I paid my water on time. She looked at the paper and said it looks right .......I just looked at her then 5mins later she said oh the water is alot. Me already annoyed reply you think? I told her the owner even looked at it  before I left and said your final were bill is 10 and asked if I wanted her to take it out the deposit I said yes. I told her to tell the owner to contact ASAP because she sent debt collector after me and thats uncool seeing as I never missed a payment on my rent and water.  I also told her I also have the payment statement for those still and will be going to get my bank statement to prove I've payed the water on time then left.  \n\nIf anyone care to hear what happened ill update after everything happens Monday.",

            "comment": "Be careful of using your breathing as a way to avoid your emotions. When you breathe with a focus on the exhale it is to help your body relax and release tension by engaging your parasympathetic nervous system. This allows you to begin to process your emotions by disengaging the tension in your body from the emotions. As the tension releases, your body can begin to integrate those emotions into your experience and natural understanding of your life/current state. If you are trying to escape your anger by focusing on your breathing, you could exacerbate your anger because of the effects of the existing bodily tension on your breathing. Consider focusing on your anger by recognizing how it manifests physically in your body. Is it a tension in your shoulders or neck? Perhaps something to do with your jaw or fists clenching? Maybe it\u2019s a tension or a pain in your chest or somewhere else? Explore where it exists in your body. Then allow your attention to go back and forth between what you identify in your physical experience and how it changes (sometimes very slightly) as you breathe with an emphasis on the exhale. You may feel the tension/pain rise with your breathing in and decrease with your breathing out. You may also find that it gets larger overall but still fluctuates. You may also find that it shifts between different areas in your body. The goal here is just to explore and keep it in your awareness as much as you can and continue noting how it changes with your breath and how different tensions may arise and disappear.\n\nAt least that\u2019s my experience. I will often get to a point where the feeling is unbearable and then I give up trying to make it go away and am just like fine, if I\u2019m gonna feel this way then I\u2019m gonna do it 100%. After this I just allow my awareness to wander between the tensions and pains and note any small changes in them as I breathe and/or adjust. Then the small changes eventually lead to bigger ones; the processing kind of happens on its own.",

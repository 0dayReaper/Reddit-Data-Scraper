I recently, spoke with a student who told me he went back to a toxic relationship since his toxic a friend would reach out again. I strongly advocate him to cut all communication from the toxic person. I hope he has learned his lesson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u16osvx667m61.jpg?width=975&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a6e1e5b652b075e6dfd5ca2d7ee0a09b43b9d1da",

    "postText": "After years and years of keeping my stress, anger and anxiety to myself, I managed to experience my second depressive episode in life. I recently started venting to my brother because he is the most likely person to understand how I feel and basically lived through the same issues but mentally, he handled it a lot better. My parents are great people but their goals for me never really lined up with what I truly wanted but I always kept it to myself. After so many years of it constantly sitting at the back of my mind I finally said something directly to them today. While it wasn't much and definitely not enough to change anything, it took a lot of weight off of my shoulders tonight.",

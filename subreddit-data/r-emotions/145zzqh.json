    "postText": "\n\nJust want to get in to this and say my English is not ideal so you can still get out of this before it\u2019s to late lmao.\n(And I talk to much)\n\nYeah so anyway I\u2019ve struggled with \u201cloneliness\u201d even when I type this I cringe. As you can see by the way I type I\u2019m still in school and I came here to rant about just that. I wouldn\u2019t say I had that many friends but I had a solid friend group that I always could make jokes with and all that good stuff. But suddenly (I forgot what happened lol) but basically I lost my friends and now i do everything at school alone. Even when I try to recall what happened I can\u2019t. I know this may be confusing but out of all the friends I lost, one left the next school year so our friendship was just still weirdly remaining. I\u2019ll just call him Mike. I remember when I first lost my friends I was really going at it with the depressed phase (still am) I was so confused about it all that I asked Mike about it.\nI basically asked him what I did wrong with the last friendships and what my flaws are. ( I know, I know pathetic ) He pretty much dodged the questions and said that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and that they were just mean. (\u201c the call is coming from inside the house \u201cLMAO) \nI personally think that if someone talks about me to you. that we've never been good friends to begin with . I get that this can come across as cliche but I don't know. i am personally loyal to my friends  (If I had any lmao) but is that too much to expect from friends and especially teenagers? I know I said a lot of useless things (but I mean you know you did click on my rant\nIt\u2019s only fair. ) And before anyone says to try to reconnect with them trust me I did. I cringe even when I recall these moments. Basically tried to talk with the remaining friends online and at first it went \u201cwell?\u201d I thought we were really locked in again but indeed I was wrong. When we got back to school. They were awkward around me and I saw people staring at me the whole time I was with them. It was basically a 30 day free trail. After that I was alone again(still am)\nAnd honestly I used to hate my old friends but now I\u2019ve realized that they were actually really good friends. \nExpect mike i low-key don\u2019t trust him. I honestly think he sabotaged my friendship with them (forgot to tell you that me and mike go way back) I think he sabotaged my other friendships to but that\u2019s a whole other complicated story. \nIs this my destiny lmao",

            "comment": "Hey there. No need to apologize. It can be challenging to navigate social stuff like this. Sometimes people behave in ways we don\u2019t expect and sometimes will never know why. \n\nIt\u2019s courageous to share this. Thank you! I think it also helps others who have similar curiosities or circumstances. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for advice but if you wanted some feedback I\u2019d just say, the more you get clear with your own confidence and presence, the less it will matter what others are up to. \n\nBe compassionate with your experience and know we all go through awkward stuff like this. \n\nYou\u2019re prob a really great person and a great friend worthy to the right people. They\u2019ll find you when you believe in yourself first. \n\nThe more clear you are w yourself, the more clearly you attract others who are a fit for where you\u2019re at.",

Sometimes people behave in ways we don\u2019t expect and sometimes will never know why. \n\nIt\u2019s courageous to share this. Thank you! I think it also helps others who have similar curiosities or circumstances. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for advice but if you wanted some feedback I\u2019d just say, the more you get clear with your own confidence and presence, the less it will matter what others are up to. \n\nBe compassionate with your experience and know we all go through awkward stuff like this. \n\nYou\u2019re prob a really great person and a great friend worthy to the right people. They\u2019ll find you when you believe in yourself first. \n\nThe more clear you are w yourself, the more clearly you attract others who are a fit for where you\u2019re at.",

    "postText": "Okay so, most of the time when I feel like the world is being cruel to me with unfair situations, I get frustrated, sad, and angry. And one of the ways I \"rebel\" against everything is by smoking. I'm not always confident enough to harm myself (with the pain and mess) but I really feel the urge to and so I smoke. I know it's unfair that I punish myself for external situations but it's so hard not to.",

    "postText": "I feel at fault, and yet I understand everything thats been done has been out of my control since the beginning, or so I feel. I feel clouded inside my chest, like a twirling rock. Anxious at the voice of my parents voice, regardless of how soft tones they\u2019ve done become. I feel guilty, for everything. I have found it harder to sit alone with myself, I scavenge through social media looking for an escape, this is something I have barely caught myself doing. I will limit myself more. I feel let down by life, but oh who doesn\u2019t. I guess expectations for anything are entirely down the drain if I\u2019m honest with you. I was incredibly suicidal when I was a young kid and failed multiple times, now 21 I feel nothing. No dreams, no hope, nothing. I feel like a machine, slowly creaking out these bubbles of \u201chumanity\u201d pretending for some odd reason. Controlling myself, even when I don\u2019t feel I have empathy I find something else control me. My consciousness\u2019s has grown quiet and my dreams as well. Everything I am doing is not of purpose anymore, but rather I feel I am just manipulating everything, like a show, however I am just performing for myself. It\u2019s incredibly isolating and everything is falling apart inside of me. So I am like a robot. However I want to be happy and feel again, I just don\u2019t want to be let down by reality itself anymore. I don\u2019t want to blame God, reality or anything. I want to smile and have pain and hopes, ups and downs and feel something worth living for. Not just a hollow shell of a life with no meaning",

It\u2019s a protection mechanism so it\u2019s cool that you noticed. You can now be familiar w what happens in high or prolonged stress in your system. \ud83d\ude0a Glad you\u2019re feeling better though remember to feel what needs to be felt. \ud83d\udc9b",

Next day my step dad has a stroke and is in the hospital. Then the day after that my roommate of 7 years died. But I just don't feel as much as I should.....",

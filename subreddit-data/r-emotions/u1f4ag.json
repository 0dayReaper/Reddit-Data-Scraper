    "postText": " \n\n\u201cHow  do you feel?\u201d The classic therapist question is asked millions of times  each day, by millions of therapists and non-therapists alike. More  times than not, \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d is given in reply. But when we are honest and  relay how we feel emotionally, we rarely are authentic.\n\nThis  isn\u2019t some armchair asshole. I spent 32-years struggling with this  seemingly simple question. Some may disagree with me when I stress how  unlikely it is to hear or even acknowledge our own authentic emotions  but think about it. Do you feel angry, or do you feel angry for  embarrassing yourself? Are you really sad, or is it that you are feeling  lonely, and in your head, you think \u201cbeing lonely is sad and pathetic\u201d?  How about happy? Are you authentically happy, or are you playing the  \u201cfake-it-to-make-it\u201d bull shit game?\n\nIn  my experience, for those 32-years, I would have laughed at someone who  said I wasn\u2019t truly feeling my emotional experiences. I was the King of  Crying! I felt all the time. Last year, having been fired from my dream  job as a therapist, I was isolated, avoiding, broke, and broken. I was  depressed. But what was I depressed about? It wasn\u2019t the initial emotion  that came up. Anger was. But I had avoided being angry my whole life  because if I let myself feel anger, then people won\u2019t like me. That  fucked up logic had me searching for another emotion. Rejection was  because I am a fuck-up. Well that\u2019s depressing, ain\u2019t it?\n\nAt  the center of this issue is that we are judging our feelings based on  the false perception that emotions can be wrong or right, good or bad.  After doing transformational work, shedding the good/bad mentality, I  have gained the skills to honestly feel the emotional experiences as  they happen. This affords me the freedom to overcome strong emotions  much faster, and even better, I am able to USE my emotional experiences  to drive myself towards my goals, not away from.\n\nI  know I am not alone in this judgment of our emotional experiences. Do  you judge your emotional experiences? Do you see emotions as right or  wrong, good or bad?",

We use previously held judgements and our past to limit how we express ourselves honestly. We express what we think we should express. We say what we think we should say. Eventually the true emotional experiences is automatically translated to what we think is \"right\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if that helps. Message me and I can give you more specific examples.",

Why do people talk to other people very often, but I'm always the one they barely talk to? It's like being overshadowed. Why wouldn't people open up to me and talk to me more? It makes me feel a bit sad when I think about it. Why? Because:\n\nOther people: They talk to other people more often than they talk to me \n\nMe: Even if they would talk to me, they don't talk to me as often as they talk to other people, it's like they like talking to other people more than me\n\nWhat is it about me that could be causing them to not talk to me as often as they talk to other people?",

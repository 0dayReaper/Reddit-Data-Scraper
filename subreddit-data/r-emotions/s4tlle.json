    "postText": "well, let me explain: i am 14 and my parents are divorcing. i'm very mature actually, i can analyse the situation from an impartial view, comprehend all the sides of a situation, etc. my dad knows that, and he vents with me, and at the beggining, it was ok, i was happy to know that i'm someone he can trust, but nowdays he does it way too much. he sometimes get into my bedroom, becames aware that i'm busy with something, and still wants to talk, and i feel bad if i tell him that i don't want to stop doing something just to listen to him complaining about life. these days i was studying for a very important test and he interrupted me. today i barely woke up, didn't even have breakfast and he was already there in my room, looking sad because i wasn't paying much attention to him (because, just as i said, i was barely waking up).\n\nas you might imagine, a divorce is hard, and sometimes i just need to get distracted, but he simply won't let me. every time i read a book he makes me stop to listen to him (if i deny listening to him, he feels bad and i feel guilty), when i watch tv he sits by my side and manages to vent, and it's annoying because i just need a break sometimes.\n\nalso, even thought i'm a comprehensible guy, i still am just a teen, not a therapist, it's not like i can handle every singe thing, or have the best advice for everything, and it's not like i'm not suffering because of the divorce, but he seems to not realise that. i do love and care about him, but this situation makes we want to be far from him. what can i do?",

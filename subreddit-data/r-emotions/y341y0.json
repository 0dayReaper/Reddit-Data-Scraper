    "postText": "Hi guys. For my bachelor thesis survey, I am looking for Austrian people to answer a few questions about emotions at work. It will take not more than 5 min. and your responses are strictly confidential.\n\nThank you so much!\n\n[https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_2meBrbbbz4tA32u](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2meBrbbbz4tA32u)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: Please don't be offended by the nationality or country category. I am making a comparison between Austria and Switzerland, which is why for this survey there is no sense in considering other countries or nationalities.",

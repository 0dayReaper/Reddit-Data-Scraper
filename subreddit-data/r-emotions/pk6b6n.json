            "comment": "Cowardice is a judgement, more specifically a form of guilt. It's associated with Fear because that's how we've labeled that particular flavor of guilt .\n\nWhen we're labeled a coward from the outside, it's a judgement from them that the actions we took weren't the actions they wanted or what was expected of us. We're labeled a coward because they believe the reason why we did what we did was influenced by fear. \n\nIf they believed it was because we didn't have a clue of what we were doing, then we'd be labeled ignorant instead. So regardless of what we were feeling, if they believe our actions were influenced by fear, we're judged a coward.\n\nWhen we label ourselves a coward. We're doing the same thing. If we feel guilty for our action or inaction and because it was influenced by fear, we label ourselves as being a coward. \n\nWe could be in the exact situation and do everything exactly the same, but if it was influenced by greed and we feel guilty about it, then we'd judge ourselves greedy.\n\nIf we remove guilt from the equation, the label of being a coward is removed.\n\nIn short, cowardice is a flavor of guilt which is a form of judgement. And if we're trying to resolve the issue of cowardice, it's not the fear that has to be resolved, it's the guilt.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPaths In the Void\n\n[Paths In the Void podcast](https://pathsinthevoid.transistor.fm/)",

                    "comment": "I follow what you mean in that hypothetical; that if someone labels themselves a coward they do so because of regret over an action they took or didn\u2019t take that they might in at least perceive as resulting from fear. It\u2019s good information, and I think indirectly answers my question. Which was more about the definition of the term than the cause of its labeling. \n\nAs you said; inaction in the face of risk could be due to ignorance rather than fear. In which case the person would be ignorant rather than a coward. It might still be labeled as cowardice, but it seems that would be a misrepresentation. Thus someone unable to experience fear cannot be a coward, nor can they be brave I suppose. Bravery is taking action that one fears isn\u2019t it? \n\nRegarding that intriguing hypothetical you brought up; your hypothetical persons regret may even be unfounded. Perhaps the choices they regret were made logically, and they presumed at the time that the likelihood of benefit to themself and/or others was higher with the action that they did take. Regardless of likeliness, no one can know the cascade of events which would have followed from an unknown result of a different action taken in the past, so there is infinite room for regret. Then in that situation the individual is neither a coward nor ignorant, but simply lost in unreasonable guilt. \ud83e\udd14",

But this only happens because a judgement is occurring. and they feel guilty, they regret their action or inaction.\n\nRemove the regret, which is another way to say guilt, then the label disappears.\n\nWhy someone feels guilty (or regrets their actions), like you mentioned there are an infinite possible reasons. But regardless of the reason, if that person feels guilty for it and believes it was motivated by fear (even if that wasn't the case at the time but believes so in hindsight) then they'll label themselves as a coward.\n\nSo what I mean to say is Cowardice = Guilt. What is cowardice? Guilt\n\nI went through the process of my thinking and how I came to this definition so you can see the pathway I used to get there. \n\nTypically Cowardice is defined as Fear (Cowardice = Fear) and by you're question you're wondering if that's the correct definition. From my perspective it's not.\n\nBut to say Cowardice = Guilt without any explanation is difficult to believe especially since it's generally believed otherwise.\n\nAnyway, this is only my perspective. You can keep it, play around with it, or throw it away. :)\n\nPaths In the Void\n\n[Paths In the Void podcast](https://pathsinthevoid.transistor.fm)",

The original question is regarding the requirement of fear behind actions in order for the resulting state of being to be accurately defined as a coward. You yourself include \u201cbelieves it was motivated by fear\u201d as a requirement in your hypothetical. You contradict yourself by defining cowardice with the component of fear then saying cowardice is not defined with fear. \n\nFurthermore your hypothetical is centered on a single scenario, and thus not capable of producing all encompassing conclusions like \u201ccowardice is guilt.\u201d However even in your scenario guilt is just the cause of the individual labeling themself as a coward. It does not prove that they are a coward (which I made a point about in my previous reply), nor indicate that cowardice is the emotion of guilt (which is illogical on multiple levels) in that specific situation.\n\nExample: Take someone who cannot feel guilt, but can feel fear. They may take actions due to fear which would label them a coward, and never feel guilty about it.",

I think if you ask people to give you a definition, 99% of the time it involves someone mentioning fear or the lack of bravery (which basically is the same).\n\nSo I'm just short handing the definition. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nI include \"believes it's motivated by fear\" because most people associate the component of Fear as essential for something to be cowardly. I'm only stepping into their shoes in why they believe what they believe. That doesn't mean I agree with it.\n\nIn the previous example, I added \"Remove the regret, which is another way to say guilt, then the label disappears.\". I should have added this line again to avoid this confusion. I just assumed it was understood. Sorry about that.\n\nSo in what scenario does cowardice not involve guilt or regret? If I'm not defining this correctly I'd genuinely like to know. I'm not attached to my answer so if you have a possible scenario I could explore that would be great.\n\nAnd for someone that doesn't feel guilt, that person wouldn't consider themselves a coward. It wouldn't register as something being true for them. Other people may say it, believe it and label him that way but for someone who doesn't feel guilt there would be no response.\n\nAnyway, I don't mean to riley you up if that's what you're feeling. I'm not here to win anything, just giving my opinion.\n\nPaths In the Void",

Although I may have understood it better after reflecting on it later, I didn\u2019t remember about this post because I indirectly got my answer from your initial reply; as I mentioned in my original comment. However it wasn\u2019t my intention to leave you with unanswered questions.\n\nI appreciate the clarifications. I wasn\u2019t sure how to word this before, but the state of being/existence I mentioned in my previous post was referring to the way in which an entity is interacting with reality (physical or mental). Also I was trying to express in my previous reply that your answer doesn\u2019t encompass the full scale of reality, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the cause of you coming to that conclusion was at the time. \n\nBased on this response it seems your sense of the term \u201ccoward\u201d is limited to the scope/box of mental reality. Thus your answer is founded within that limited scope. As I predicted back then, you asked for an example of a situation that does not fit into the limited scope you\u2019re working in. Which is why I gave an example of that in my last reply. \n\nSomeone not considering oneself a coward in their own mental reality doesn\u2019t mean one isn\u2019t affected by the physical reality brought on from their interactions with it, or induced by those which do see the person as a coward within their own mental realities. This may be a matter of opinion, but I believe it best to define things based on the physical reality one finds oneself in. The benefit of empirical definitions is that in any given scenario if the individual also acknowledges the accepted definitions of the terms, and are aware of their reasons for doing things, they would concur with the conclusion. As would any other individual under the same circumstances. Which not only garners consensus, but allows one to predict future events with higher accuracy. \n\nAs mentioned using different wording before, I now understand the terms \u201cbravery\u201d and \u201ccowardice\u201d as referring to an interaction or avoidance of interaction with physical reality while under the influence of significant fear induced by the actions they conceive-of/imagine taking to accomplish the interaction. Specifically that choosing to take an action that instills significant fear is bravery, and choosing to avoid an interaction with reality (physical or mental) due to the action instilling significant fear is cowardice. Regarding your other statement, just as it is possible for an individual to incorrectly perceive a reality with someone else being a coward because that person did not take certain actions when that person did not avoid those actions due to their fear of the interaction, it is possible for someone to be mistaken about themselves in any instance of the terms\u2019 uses. \n\nThe reality is that we are driven by our subconscious, and come up with reasoning to explain subconscious desires (in the case of introverted behavior) and behaviors (in the case of extroverted behavior). Which is limited by the reasoning capabilities of the individual contemplating the situation, and thus prone to inaccuracy. Even the brightest minds in the world know they need the Scientific Method in order to actually come up with accurate conclusions, for not even the smartest person on Earth has perfect reasoning. \n\nThus based on the above accepted definitions of the characteristics \u201cbravery\u201d and \u201ccowardice,\u201d if one is avoiding actions due to being afraid to take them they are a coward. In the sense that the results of their interactions with physical reality reflect this. It is thus true regardless of whether they acknowledge that it is the case in their own mental reality or not, and regardless of whether their reasoning stems from guilt, logic, or anything else.",

And thanks for taking the time and effort to give a response.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, I\u2019d like to make clear that I\u2019m not interested in proving myself right or proving you wrong. I\u2019m interested in the discussion since it helps me have clarity on what I believe (and see if those beliefs are stable or not) and gain insight on what other people believe. So I hope you take this more as a collaboration on exploring the topic.\r  \n\r  \nFor me, when we label someone a coward or ourselves a coward, we are judging them for some action. Just like we label a thief for the action of \u201cstealing\u201d, we label a coward for the action of \u201crunning away\u201d. So for a \u201ccoward\u201d or \u201cthief\u201d to exist there must be a judge, an actor and a specific action.\r  \n\r  \nThe existence of the \u201ccoward\u201d only comes from point-of-view of the judge. For example, a really good fighter might walk away from a fight because they are afraid to hurt someone. So the intention of the fighter and the feeling of the fighter is not that of a coward because they are Not judging themselves as having \u201crun away\u201d because of fear.\r  \n\r  \nBut someone watching might consider the person a coward. They don\u2019t know the fighter's intention. All they see is someone \u201crunning away\u201d from a fight because they believe that person was afraid so they judge that person a coward.\r  \n\r  \nWe could reverse this example. Say the fighter walks away from the fight because they are actually afraid to fight the person. So the intention of the fighter and the feeling of the fighter is that of a coward. But it\u2019s only because they are judging themselves as a coward.\r  \n\r  \nSomeone watching might consider that person brave. They don\u2019t know the fighter\u2019s intention. All they see is someone \u201cwalking away\u201d from a fight and considers that action as being brave.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, say the fighter walks away from the fight because they are afraid to fight the person. So the intention of the fighter and the feeling of the fighter is to \u201crun away\u201d in fear from the fight. But they judge the action as being reasonable, who in their right mind wants to get beat up? So, for the fighter, they do Not consider themselves a coward because they don\u2019t judge themselves to be.\n\nWe can mix and match the examples, but the key is the judgment of the action from the judge's point-of-view (whether it's us or someone else judging our action).\n\n\r\r  \n*Someone not considering oneself a coward in their own mental reality doesn\u2019t mean one isn\u2019t affected by the physical reality brought on from their interactions with it, or induced by those which do see the person as a coward within their own mental realities.*\r  \n\r  \nTo make sure I understand you, what you\u2019re saying is even if we don\u2019t consider ourselves a coward we\u2019ll be affected by other people's belief that we\u2019re a coward?\r  \n\r  \nWe will be affected by other people\u2019s opinions. This I don\u2019t disagree with. But for us to believe that we are a coward, we have to be the one doing the judging. No one can force us to judge ourselves a coward. 7 billion people can consider us a coward but if we don\u2019t believe it, we won\u2019t judge ourselves to be one. This doesn't mean our life won't be affected by those 7 billion people but whether we believe we're a coward or not is up to us.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s like if we were a football linebacker that\u2019s 6\u20195\u201d and 300lbs and being offended by a 5 year-old calling us ''weak \u201c. If we believe we are, we\u2019ll be offended regardless of who it is because a part of us believes it already and we\u2019re judging ourselves for it. The 5 year-old, may have been the trigger, but the trigger is there because a part of us believes it.\r  \n\r  \nBut if we know that we\u2019re not, then it won\u2019t even register. Like someone telling us that clouds are made of marshmallows. If we absolutely believe the statement to be false there\u2019s no need to argue over it.\r  \n\r  \n*Thus based on the above accepted definitions of the characteristics \u201cbravery\u201d and \u201ccowardice,\u201d if one is avoiding actions due to being afraid to take them they are a coward. In the sense that the results of their interactions with physical reality reflect this. It is thus true regardless of whether they acknowledge that it is the case in their own mental reality or not, and regardless of whether their reasoning stems from guilt, logic, or anything else.*\r  \n\r  \nSo what you\u2019re saying is, if someone avoids an action based on being afraid regardless of their intention, it\u2019s considered \u201ccowardice\u201d. I\u2019ll have to disagree with this \r  \n\r  \nFor example, I\u2019m afraid of jumping off a 10 story building because I would die. This isn\u2019t cowardice but common sense. I\u2019m afraid to put my hand in the fire, stick a pencil in my eye, etc. There\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m afraid of but I wouldn\u2019t judge myself a coward. And if other people judged me as a coward for being afraid of doing those things, I\u2019d in turn judge them as being a bit harsh on their judgments ;)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\r\rThe examples I\u2019ve given have been about physical actions but they can be internal actions as well. Like \u201crunning away\u201d from our emotions or from making internal decisions about who we are or who we want to become. So we can also consider ourselves as \u201ccowards\u201d in the internal world as well as the external (physical) world. But that only comes after we\u2019ve judged ourselves as being so. The keystone to \u201ccowardice\u201d is the judge.\r  \n\r  \nTo drift a little off-topic, the judge is in effect a bully and the actor is being bullied. For the judge, they pass judgment to push the actor down so the judge feels elevated. When we judge someone a coward, whether we tell that person or not, it\u2019s because we\u2019re insecure about ourselves and want to feel \"better than\" someone else. We believe, consciously or unconsciously, that we\u2019re a coward as well and we hide this by pointing to other people (regardless of whether it\u2019s true or not) to distract them from seeing it in us.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we judge ourselves to be \u201ccowards\u201d, this is a bit more tricky to unravel so to keep it short. My best advice is to \u201cstop it\u201d :)\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, that\u2019s my very long 2 cents :)",

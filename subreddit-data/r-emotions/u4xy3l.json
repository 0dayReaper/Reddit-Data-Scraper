I believe we should not be so determined to follow every tragedy, suffering the intensity of the tragic reality of life, that we destroy our own sanity and enjoyment. I guess we each must find our own balance of optimistic illusions and connection to the hard realities.",

I would probably place optimistic illusion more in line with pumped up visions of our talents and characteristics. Perhaps, similar to hope when that hope is placed on dreams we can't reasonably obtain.",

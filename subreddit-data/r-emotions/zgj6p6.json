This is about the things i do, how i have failed, ive pinpointed my mind as a antagonistic organ, because it is. I have so much that i could be, but the constant fighting the constant escaping the constant bullshit that i feel is all the same organ. \n\nMy parents gave me what i needed but since i wqs a child a arrogant, very stubborn, very ungratefull and i allways looked for the next rush, the next happiness, is all that matters. And now that same mind still lives, ive tried, i mean it, ive tried dealing with it, negotiating in a way, i learnt about dopamine, i inject myself with suplement cocktails and my parents pay high for that. \n\nIm very healthy, i exercize regulary, eat good foods, i have put myself on a path and given myself a purpose with potential rush of happiness, ive given myself value etc. Point is ive given this mind everything, everything to make it exited, to make it perform better to be more happy but all just falls in vain, i just keep being the child and causing suffering to myself and others, i have disgraced so much. Im really tired, and i cant deal with something that \"naturally\" seeks what it believes is good for me or survival.",

Overall i need to really dwelde intro true genuine pain in order to feel the gravity of my actions and value work more, i need my body to really see itself in decadence so its starts developing more usefullness and thinks less about bullshit.\n\nIm too comfortable, i have it too easy, i live too well, i need to recreate a ambient of threats and where priorities due to mortal danger are supported by everypart of my being. I need think less, be less of a existing person and fade away into routines and work, at least being able to acheive when i need and to feel no bullshit ever, becausenif bullshit arises blood gets spilled.",

This is my doing, im not product of an enviroment, im a product of myself, ive been given everything and repay with more bullshit.

This is about me, not others, there no influence, i just to think like that, that my parents didth give sum things that have affected me, but ive come to see, that just is not the case, the case is that i didth apriciated their love, i did not pay attention when they where doing things that would help me to have more compassion or love. I esencially ignored they're importance and level of love they had for me, i know i feel like they loved me less. Im tired of this and im scared of the future after what i have done on this semester, what i did today, i did this things, i hit breaking point today, and its time for me to really wake up and do things.",

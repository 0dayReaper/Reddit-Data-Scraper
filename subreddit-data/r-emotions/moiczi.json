    "postText": "When I was younger I didnt and still don\u2019t like enteracting with or just being around people, so I didn\u2019t really learn much social skills other then from my mums daycare where my friends would trick me into thinking they were hurt, so I would feel bad. But now when\u2019s someone hurt or feels bad I kinda just stand there and don\u2019t know what to do, and it gets really awkward. one time someone fell over and I just stood there staring at them while other people around me helped them, and personally I don\u2019t like people asking if I\u2019m ok it makes me tear up for some reason. But even worse then that my not so close close friends dad died from cancer, this was one of the kids who went to the daycare and would pretended to be hurt. We aren\u2019t close at all now but my mum feels really sad because she was friends with him and I don\u2019t feel anything at all, I did talk to his dad when I was younger and he taught me how to do stuff like not be scared of dogs. But what I\u2019m really scared of is going to his funeral and not feeling sorry, I probably won\u2019t cry or anything. Also my mum goes to me for sectional support because my brother is a lot, but honestly I hate hugging her and hearing he be really upset is is kinda of bothersome, she leans on me because I\u2019m the \u201cgood child\u201d who cant do anything wrong, and it puts a lot of pressure on me.",

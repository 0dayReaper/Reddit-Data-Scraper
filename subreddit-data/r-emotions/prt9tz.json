    "postText": "Maybe it's crazy to say this, but have you ever felt like your eyes are dry, even if you haven't cried? First time I feel this. Like I am very sad, but not allowing myself to cry. But despite that, is like I can feel I've been crying. Is this weird?\n\nKind of reminds me of that one scene from Watchmen, where Veidt explains Doctor Manhattan's emotions. They are not clearly on the outside, but they are there.\n\nJust curious to know if any of you have felt this. Might be just my psyque playing trick on me, I don't know.",

    "postText": "My mom was a shitty mother when in was growing up, never at home because she was either working or living her own life without her toddler-elementary aged little girl. During that time it was always my dad who would take me to school events softball games etc.). Throughout that time period I was often asked by other girls mothers &amp; the other girls \"Where's your mom?\" \"How'd your mom die\" \"Is your mom dead?\" \"Do you *really* know that man?\" (In reference to my father) . Those were the most common questions I got asked. I've never been close with my mom. But today we got in an argument because she was calling my father a \"failure\" because *he* didn't know how to teach me to bathe as a child and that was why i still struggle with dandruff as a young adult. So I said \"Maybe if you were there for me &amp; ever tried to teach me those types of things I would know how to properly take care of myself.\" She lost it and went on about how she always busted her ass for me etc etc &amp; how shes never wanted anything more than to bond with her daughter, so here's where i turned into an asshole \"Really?  You're trying to bond with your daughter who constantly got asked 'Is your mom dead?how'd she die? is that man you're walking to the car with really your father?' You're trying to bond with the same little girl who grew up thinking her mom may as well be dead because shes never here?! Then mom lost it went outside and cried then came back inside and went straight to her room. Is it *normal* that i don't feel bad? (JUST FYI dad has had a well paying 9-5 job that starting out on its own was more than enough to care for a family of 3)",

If she had the opportunity to be there for your school events and washing but didn\u2019t, that was her choice.  \nShe might regret it now but don\u2019t let her gaslight you or blame your father.",

            "comment": "It's important to get those feelings out. If we don't, they rot at our cores. Saying things out opens up the process to also openly express ourselves when we have good things to share.\n\nYou are justified to feel what you feel and absolutely correct in expressing yourself, as long as it is not constantly repeated. Repeating them constantly would be harassment, while getting them out is cleansing. So get those feelings out and be done with it, go on. Give your mom the room to improve.\n\nLife isn't easy for anyone and there are always surprise curveballs hitting us. This can also be the case for your mother, father, yourself, anyone you see on the street.\n\nWe all have an idea, an ideal we strive for. When the gap between that and reality becomes too wide, we feel lost and lose focus on stuff, while still focusing on the ideal. What I suggest is inviting your mother for a coffee or have a 1-on-1 talk at home so that you and her can both express yourselves and listen to each other more.",

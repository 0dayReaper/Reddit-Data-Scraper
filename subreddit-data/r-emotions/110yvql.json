If she had the opportunity to be there for your school events and washing but didn\u2019t, that was her choice.  \nShe might regret it now but don\u2019t let her gaslight you or blame your father.",

            "comment": "It's important to get those feelings out. If we don't, they rot at our cores. Saying things out opens up the process to also openly express ourselves when we have good things to share.\n\nYou are justified to feel what you feel and absolutely correct in expressing yourself, as long as it is not constantly repeated. Repeating them constantly would be harassment, while getting them out is cleansing. So get those feelings out and be done with it, go on. Give your mom the room to improve.\n\nLife isn't easy for anyone and there are always surprise curveballs hitting us. This can also be the case for your mother, father, yourself, anyone you see on the street.\n\nWe all have an idea, an ideal we strive for. When the gap between that and reality becomes too wide, we feel lost and lose focus on stuff, while still focusing on the ideal. What I suggest is inviting your mother for a coffee or have a 1-on-1 talk at home so that you and her can both express yourselves and listen to each other more.",

    "postText": "I will admit, I am pretty much a softie and I feel like me being soft gets the better of me at certain times. Like when I\u2019m getting into a heated argument with someone or something that is really conflicting , I get teary eyed and have to blow my nose afterwards for example. I want to be able to some degree have the ability to do things like this without my emotions getting the better of me. My father is emotionally strong like this and I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m a wuss for being real sensitive. I am a 19 year old male btw if that clears things up. What is some things I could practice for me to act harder like exercise or motivation etc. ? Please keep the comments nice please. Thanks!",

What triggers you may have,  etc.\n\nThen consider how they actually feel in your body and really sit with them. \n\nThen contemplate what ends up resolving these feelings.\n\nAll of these questions will help you truly understand yourself and make it easier to really process them in a healthy way. That way when something does come up, you have the emotional fortitude to hold it down for the moment and process when you have time alone.\n\nIt is very likely that your father bottles up alot of his emotions in an unhealthy way, much like most of hos generation. He doesn't know how to healthily process jis emotions so he bottles them up and they come out in unintended ways, such as frustration and anger. Don't take those personally and try asking him what's really wrong the next time he gets angry.",

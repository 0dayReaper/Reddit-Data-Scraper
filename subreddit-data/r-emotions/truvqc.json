    "postText": "I feel so sensitive to rejection. I feel like my heart is heavy and hurts. I feel like I could almost cry. I have interviewed with a few places for a counseling internship, and I was so hopeful about this last one. The other rejections stung, but this one stings the most. I feel so inadequate when I'm rejected. I feel so much emotional pain.",

            "comment": "u/Breros gives a good explanation. Childhood experiences carry a lot of emotional weight because we are literally dependent on the help of others and we lack the resources, skills and life experience to cope alone. Unfortunately we don\u2019t always get the help and encouragement we need to feel confident in ourselves and in the love and kindness of others.   \nAs a social species that has always depended for survival on cooperation and social bonds our sense of belonging and acceptance by others is crucial to our sense of safety and well being. \n\nI\u2019d just add for clarity that our emotions are physical, muscular sensations caused by the solar plexus (the abdominal brain), which uses nerve impulses to stimulate specific parts of the smooth muscles around our internal organs. These muscular contractions are interpreted as either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 and their purpose is to motivate us to either avoid harm or seek pleasure.   \nThe sensation of \u2018happy excitement\u2019 is the stimulation of specific muscle fibres only a cm or so from the spot that creates a sensation of dread. Both are feelings about what we expect to happen in the near future, one is good and makes us want to pursue that activity, the other is bad and makes us want to run away.   \nFeelings are what control all our choices, thoughts without feelings have no power over us.   \nOur powerful imaginations can create lots of plans and strategies to help pursue these physical, emotional urges but the solar plexus doesn\u2019t know the difference between whats actually happening in the present and what\u2019s a memory, it\u2019s like a security guard in a locked room looking at a video screen and pressing alarm buttons. The screen might be showing a memory of a past event mixed up with a current one.   \n\nMuscle memory also plays a big role in our reactions. Just like you can train your muscles over time to perform complex tasks like piano playing, archery etc, with repetition, \u2018automatically\u2019 and without conscious thought, so your solar plexus can learn to respond with negative sensations in the abdominal muscles, to situations that seem similar to past, unhappy events. Feelings of sadness and rejection can become the \u2018go to\u2019 reaction and background state.\n\nRepeatedly remembering and rehearsing past unhappy events continually triggers negative emotional output from the solar plexus, establishing the habit. \nHowever, the imagination can also train the solar plexus to change its reaction. By deliberately remembering and focusing on past success and happy memories we can create a different, more positive and confident emotional state. By listing and rehearsing the memories of any past happiness we can persuade the solar plexus that the outside world is a kinder, more supportive environment, and turn down those alarm signals. Positive people have an ingrained habit of remembering positive experiences and focusing on those. So rejections don\u2019t hurt nearly as badly. Future success is expected.  \n\nAlso, see if you can find an osteopath who can do abdominal massage called the \u2018Barral technique\u2019. It relaxes the muscles that create emotional stress and people I know who\u2019ve had it done say they felt like they were floating on air afterwards, stress free and blissfully happy.",

I\u2019ll do it now.   \nInteresting your point about deliberately letting go of tension around a specific issue at that present moment. Reminds me of how a lot of animals shake themselves to relieve stress as soon as the moment of danger has passed.",

            "comment": "Thanks for the thoughts. I wasn't so much confused about why I felt the pain as much as I just didn't like feeling the pain and wanted to... vent. Yes, my reactions are probably automatic reactions from the past experiences. My reactions were probably useful before and aren't any longer, and it will take time for me to... change into habits that are more productive and appropriate for the new situations I face. The feelings are still unpleasant. And... I still react to that unpleasantness. I know that there are lifestyle changes that could help. I exercise, meditate, and journal, particularly gratitude journaling. But, inevitably, the feelings will be fluid. And in the moments that they hurt, I do questionable things, like post here seeking validation, attention, or whatever.",

    "postText": "I feel distressed, and sad, due to a number of reason that are disconnected from reality. \n\nFor example: i feel alone, but i am not alone, im very very far from being alone. Im very blessed and with great love around me.\n\nDespite working out, studying, working on things that i like, working for greater things. I still have this ungratefull emotions that if a describe them to you, i sound like a crybaby or a spoiled child.\n\nThey are, at this point, a defect that is making me more ineffecient. Which has caused a lot of problems in college as of currenly, and a lot of unnesesary 100% avoidble suffering.\n\nI just wanted to share this here. Im working on getting a neurological test done to see my chemical balance, cuz i believe this is not so deep and is just my brain doing things wrong cuz it feels like it. \n\n\"Emotions are telling you something important\" what if there's nothing important to tell? What if is all ungratefullness? \n\nJust wanted to get this off my chest (even tgought it doesth get off my chest, it just becomes louder)\n\nIve tried psycology all my life, since a child, i came out worse lol.\n\nAll i want is a pill to make it shut up, teach it a lesson, my dumb mind.",

And i take care of my body, or at least i try to (college does not make it easy), but i do a lot of things that i like. My mind, and this feeling, are the ones that stop me from doing the things i love.  if you say that loving yourself is doing the things that make you feel that, then i do those but the same ungrafull emotions prevent me or make me do those things inneficienly.\n\nSo myself is preventing myself from loving myself.\n\nAn also, there's no reason for me to even hate myself, nor love myself really. Like im developing and im fine. Its not like i am the best man now.\n\nAnd its not only loneliness, is just dumb emotions that disturb my efficiency. They are dumb cuz they areat in touch wity reality. \n\nIf loving myself is accepting that i feel like that for no reason, then.",

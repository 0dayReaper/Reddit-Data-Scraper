    "postText": "To rephrase that im made to feel like expressing my emotions is wrong.The girl that i have been dating for 3 years is super emotional and bi polar, so whenever anything puts her in a bad mood im the one she takes it out on shes always cursing at me and bitching at me fpr everything i do. Ive been made to feel like everything i do is wrong. Im always walkimg on eggshells everyday and im so fucking tired of it. Whenever i try to talk to her about it i get upset bc she automaticly makes me feel liike shit by saying that im just trying to make her feel like shit then she breaks down crying and cursing at me when all i was trying to do was get her to stop treating me like this. Ive never been able to get anywhere with her she always just makes her self the center of it all like i dont have problems im starting to believe that i dont matter i already dont feel like i can do anything right and now i just feel like im not allowed to express my emotions",

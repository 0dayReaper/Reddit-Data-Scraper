    "postText": "Why do I act out so calmly when I'm irritated and mad? \n\nWhen something happens to me that brought me down, that developed into anger that is quite irritable inside my chest. However, this makes me calmer and indifferent than usual, every emotion seems to be at baseline and not spike too high (sadness, happiness, anger). \n\nI do feel that something wants me to release that irritable feeling, like the urge to slam a table, but I just don't feel like it'll do anything, and giving in to that means I have no emotional control.\n\nps. I am a very active person and I hit the gym very often with intense weight training, I also practice BJJ 6 days a week. So any tips for releasing emotions through exercise are kind of useless to me bc I already do a shit ton of that.\n\nsry for the grammar, was groggily when writing this",

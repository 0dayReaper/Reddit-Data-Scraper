    "postText": "A lot has happened over the past few months, and it\u2019s been pretty difficult, and a lot of difficult stuff lies in the few months ahead of me, but I\u2019m trying to be positive about them as much as I can. However the people around me (my family etc) have no empathy for me. They treat me like trash. Even my parents; they remind me of my responsibilities and really dig holes if I make one small mistake. My boyfriend and I are also going through a rough patch and I\u2019m certain we\u2019re about to break up but I don\u2019t care? Although everything that is happening is hurting me, I can\u2019t get myself to cry (like I usually do, to release pain) and I just feel numb and emotionless.",

I don't know how I battled through that time but it was tough. Really tough. Just wanted to say that better days come around. Soon enough! Love you \ud83d\udc95",

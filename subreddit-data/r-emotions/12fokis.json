    "postText": "10 years ago I met a girl that I liked a lot. We became very close friends. We knew that we liked each other. Both of our personalities complement each other. Her mom made sure that she wouldn\u2019t get romantically involved with someone without her permission. She wanted a good life for her daughter. I didn\u2019t have much going on for me. I was recently migrated to this new country and still trying to figure things out. The girl was from my home country but different ethnic background which made her family even more reluctant to see me because her husband. It\u2019s been 10 years since we talked. I have since, went to university and started a career, became a contributing member of the society, and made success for myself. We both got married to someone else have built a family. My mind and heart they keep torturing me. For all these years, I still see her in my dreams. I still wish if we can be together. My chest feels elevated every time I think of her smile. I once was told that God created a unique person for each of us and I truly believe that she was the one. The problem is I can\u2019t be with her. We both have different branches in this life now but my soul can\u2019t forget her and I keep hurting every time she visits my thoughts and heart. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel a great loss in my life. Is there anything I can do to release her from my deep conscious mind?\n\nThanks in advance",

And speak to her with what your heart needs to say. Explain your circumstances and allow yourself to grieve afterwards if needed. Don\u2019t mistake your current family and partner as an error as you have a blessing that many people don\u2019t. Now that you\u2019ve committed to them, do your best as a father and a partner to honor your decisions and honor their need for your role in their lives. Invest in what makes you happy about them and let that love grow. Give it attention and care. You can heal from the past and create a beautiful future with what you have.",

    "postText": "Thoughts on this article? It helped me in learning how to manage strong and painful emotions. \n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202212/manage-painful-feelings-follow-these-steps](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202212/manage-painful-feelings-follow-these-steps)\n\n* Not everyone has the opportunity to learn emotional skills from their parents growing up. This makes emotion management challenging as an adult.\n* Knowing what to do when you're hurting equips you to cope and makes you more resilient.\n* As an adult, you can learn how to manage painful feelings, such as by naming the emotion, letting yourself cry, and breathing through it.",

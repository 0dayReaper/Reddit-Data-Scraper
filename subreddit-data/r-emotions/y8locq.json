            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for sharing this. So important that you trust your instinct to find support. Crying is the natural process of release, which is a good thing. So, trying not to cry puts additional stress on what\u2019s stored inside. (Pressurizing contents may make them explode.) So the first thing is, to realize it\u2019s happening for a good reason and to thank your body for working properly. :) Second thing is, this is totally normal for anger and frustration to result in crying. All that emotion needs to go somewhere and if our bodies can\u2019t contain it, it needs to be released. It sounds like there\u2019s either a history of \u2018emotional stuff\u2019 stored inside or that you haven\u2019t developed a safe place internally to express yourself in what might be higher stress / potential conflict situations. Could either of these be true (or both?) .. Not medical advice :)",

I do know that whenever I used to cry, my parents would force me to be quiet by warning me that they will hit or punish me more. I also remember putting strain on my neck and I have been advised to not since I have thyroid problems as well. I do want to go to a therapist but I am just finding it hard to tell my mother about going because she would never listen to me if I told her it might be their fault. They look down on therapy all the time.",

                            "comment": "Yeah, that\u2019s a tough one because sometimes we need our parents support to get to therapy. Maybe you can pitch them the idea about a topic that doesn\u2019t relate to them and see if they\u2019re willing to support. What happens between you and the therapist is confidential so they wouldn\u2019t really have to know. Anyhow, I guess it makes sense why you would have so much pressure around the topic of crying. For you to build some thing that feels more manageable, maybe you want to try some coping practice like taking 10 deep breath\u2018s when you\u2019re frustrated, being with your body when it feels unbalanced, assuring your system that it\u2019s OK to be exactly the way it is. But giving yourself permission to feel what you feel, you take away some of the stress of resisting. Even if you have to have an emotional outburst, be compassionate with yourself instead of judging yourself harshly. There\u2019s a saying you have to feel to heal. So resisting kind of makes things worse.",

    "postText": "I recently was completely ghosted by my boyfriend of almost 5 months. We had been going through stuff since almost the beginning of officially dating, long story short we both were going through emotional stuff\u2026. But he was everything I was looking for, everything I wanted and needed. Anyways, I was super drunk and got really sad thinking about him.. I looked at a picture and started sobbing but literally somehow I shut it off immediately.. like mid-tears streaming down my face I told myself it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fine.. and suddenly I felt nothing. Literally Not a single thing. As if I wasn\u2019t just actively sobbing\u2026\u2026. How is that possible?",

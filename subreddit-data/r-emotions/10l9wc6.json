They are your emotions. \u201cThe colors duke, the colors.\u201d Use them to your advantage. They have an effect. Get into logic it is the side of the brain you are neglecting. Knowing/Logic vs believing/emotion. Left brain vs right brain. You don\u2019t have balance. Don\u2019t be positive or negative. Be balanced.",

If you believe you can\u2019t or believe you can you are right! So I believe what I want, so that I can have whatever it is. I believe I control my chemicals. I stopped saying I don\u2019t. I intake food. I have control. I exercise. I have control. I cleanse. I have control. I balance my chemicals. I have control.\n\nI work on my trauma. I don\u2019t sit in it and act like I can do nothing. I am not reactive I am proactive. I can work on myself. My principles. Don\u2019t work in anything else. Principles are truths. Truths don\u2019t change. Build on the foundation of truth.\n\u201cI am the programmer. I write the program. I execute the program.\u201d",

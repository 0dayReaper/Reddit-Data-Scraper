If something about it is stressful we\u2019d naturally walk away.or run. If it was an obvious threat to our lives we might fight.  \nHaving to suppress these natural reactions because of rules creates a lot of pent up and unresolved stress.  \nMaybe you need a physical outlet for your feelings, like running or boxing a bag or something else strenuous that you can do at lunchtime or after school.  \nThe other thing to remember is that school isn\u2019t for ever, there is an end to it and then you\u2019re free to make choices and go where you want.  \n\nThe pressures of school and life in general leads some young people to try alcohol or cannabis etc to cope. My advice would be not to do that.  \nHiding from discomfort brings no wisdom or growth.",

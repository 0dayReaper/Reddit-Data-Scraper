    "postText": "I'm wondering if people can give me some insight into something I do not understand.  It revolves my emotions whenever I am around one of my co-worker at work,\n\nI'm a 39 year old social worker, married and have two kids with one on the way (19 weeks with my third).  I've been having a tough go, having lost my mom to COVID-19. and dealing with a strained marriage; probably due to both stress, grief and pregnancy hormones.\n\nMy workplace is great.  I usually talk to my co-workers; they are wonderful and supportive and I can le my stress and frustrations out and they are very understanding and I feel comfortable talking to them while at the same time, keeping check of my emotions.  However, when I am around one particular co-worker, I always \"lose myself\" and my emotions get the best of me and then the tears always seem to flow and the flood gate open.  This afternoon  we went for a walk and I did it again, I got emotional and cried around her.  \n\nI don't know what this is about but I find myself embarrassed, almost.  She is 23, 16 years my junior,  There are days when I ask her to come to my office just because I need the support  or days when I come to her office and ask if ai can just sit for a bit, \n\nLooking for others opinions on this.  I don't understand the connection to her.  It ha to be more than I simply feel safe around her, because I feel the same about my other colleagues but for some odd reason I get so emotionally vulnerable around her.",

By the seem of it, she sounds like a very lovely person and so do you. Just wanting to get a fuller picture before making anymore uh... words.\nPS: Hug and kiss your kids and wife tonight. Tell them you love them. You probably do that anyways but do it extra. Just for the kicks of it \ud83d\ude02",

And online school takes away social contact so that is what is probably messing with you the most. Your grandma almost passing is sad but if I where you I would try to spend as much time with her as you can. And the girl not liking you back... That sucks man. I would just try to see her flaws and maybe it would knock your crush away. And maybe she does like you who know... You should test the waters maybe.",

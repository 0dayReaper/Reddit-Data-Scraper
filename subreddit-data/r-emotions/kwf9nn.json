Because to have your feelings hurt, you first have to believe something about yourself. \u201cI\u2019m unlovable,\u201d for example. Or, \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d \n\nYour feelings get hurt because you make meaning from other people\u2019s actions based on these types of beliefs.",

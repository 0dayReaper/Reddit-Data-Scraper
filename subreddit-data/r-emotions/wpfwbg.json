I want to say that you need to hold yourself accountable this time. \n\nEven if that means admitting to people that you've failed. That's the worst that could happen. You can find a new path if you don't want to stick it out through college. If that means struggling for months maybe longer.... You have a right to decide if that's the path you want to keep walking. Ultimately, you are the one that lives with your choices. You are free.\n\nBe who YOU want to be. Be accountable to yourself. Learn to trust yourself.\n\n Don't be afraid to micromanage yourself either if you are working towards your goals but losing focus. Even marathon runners hit walls. It's not easy to power through but they choose to anyways. But serious runners surround themselves with a great support system.\n\nUse phone timers to manage your time. Plan rewards for making goals. Tell others in your life about your studies and your goals. Use your tribe for support. You'll end up around the right people and end up encouraging others to do their best too.\n\nMutual accountability can be a great way to stay focused when you hit a wall.",

For example, both anxiety and happy excitement are felt in the liver, in two distinct places, about 2cm apart.  \nOur feelings control every choice we make and everything we do.   \nThoughts without feelings have no power to motivate us.  \nYou seem to think that \u2018you\u2019 are something separate from your feelings and desires, perhaps a purely rational being who inhabits only a part of your brain, being carried around in a body that is acting against your wishes.  \nThis is not true.    \nIt sounds very much as though you have conflicting desires (feelings). A desire to talk to someone about your feelings and be heard and understood, and an opposite desire to avoid doing so and focus entirely on academic study without distractions.  \nYou will not be happy until you reconcile your feelings with your deliberate plans.      \n\u2018You\u2019 are not separate from the desire to talk to an attractive girl at college. This is not \u2018your mind\u2019 acting against \u2018you\u2019.   \nThose feelings are you. Both the desire to talk to someone and the conflicting desire to avoid it.   \nMay I ask why you say \u2018you\u2019 don\u2019t care about talking to an attractive girl? You thought about her all day, so clearly you do care.   \nSure, if we have a clear plan we wish to follow, such as studying a difficult subject, distractions can be irritating, but perhaps accept that in order to be happy you need more than just the purpose of study.",

This is not healthy.\nBeing socially awkward or \u2018nerdy\u2019 will make it more difficult to find a romantic or sexual partner but there\u2019s something you can do about that.  \n\nThere is a secret which will make you more attractive to everyone, not just women.   \nIt\u2019s something you can practise and it will help you to make friends and find girlfriends.   \nKindness.  \nThe one thing that most people want more than anything, especially people away from home at college, trying to figure out what they\u2019re doing and feeling stressed and nervous, is Kindness.  \n\nYou said you want to be in service to a greater organisation, to not hand to think about yourself.  \nSo stop thinking about your difficulties, and pay attention to other people.   \nListen without judgement, help them where you can. Put aside selfish desires and act in service to those around you.   \nIf you can do this with genuine generosity you will attract friends who appreciate you.   \nAnd chicks dig that.  \nNo, seriously, a kind and nerdy guy who\u2019s a bit awkward is much more attractive than a confident but selfish guy. Especially to girls who have been let down in love, which is quite a lot at college.  \nAs for masturbation, it\u2019s an excellent way to de-stress and releases all sorts of useful and beneficial chemicals. It\u2019ll also help you sleep. So as long as you do it in private, and no more than a couple of times a day, it won\u2019t take over your life but it will help reduce the tension you\u2019re feeling.",

I want to be like him, to put aside every \"need\" my mind or \"me\" fabricates based on some desires and just focus on what i do and be fine and ok with my progression towards my goal, aka i want to be a man, not a boy asking girls out without having something to offer. I want to be a man on a path. \n\nBut i mean, if have to really engage in the desire for random things about love or otherwise cuz \"me\" forces me too then, i guess, just to end it. \n\nI just dont understand, i was loved, ive been loved, ive been continued to be love (in fact today was my 20th birthday and didth even think that it was and my parents made a cake for me, i never asked for that, but they did it anyway), ive talked to my parents and friends about my expressions and it doesth end well, it doesth help them, and its egotistical from my part to force them throught while we reach no clear solution. And in the end of the day i have what i need, i have the tools and connections, there no reason for me to have all the struggle, this all has been, since birth, my mind that got affected my some childhood thing or random event and is now acting based opun that.\n\nI want be ok, not happy af, not suicidal, just ok.

It enabled physically weak individuals to cooperate and stand together to repel much larger and stronger predators, which is why we\u2019re here today.  \nEmpathy is essential for relationships. You said in one post that you\u2019re mildly autistic. I don\u2019t know if this means you find it difficult to intuit the feelings of others, but kindness is a skill that can be learned.  \nMay I suggest you look at Marshall Rosenberg\u2019s work on \u2018Non violent Communication\u2019. It describes a formula for communication which allows people to understand each other and find common ground.  \nAlso Scott Peck\u2019s book \u2018The Road Less Travelled\u2019, particularly the chapter on Love, in which he says that love is not a feeling, it\u2019s the willingness to be kind, to do things for the benefit of someone else, even, or especially if inconvenient to ourselves. To put ourselves out unselfishly to help someone feel happier and reduce their burden.",

And is not because i hate women or sum incel shit, is that right now i dont need this and i cant/dont deserve to have this: Im in my 20s, i have things to do, i have a debt to my country, i have altruistic goals, i have projects and studyinh to do, i got places to go, i got someone to anwser orders to. Im not fit for a woman, im not what a woman deserves, its not my time for this. \n\nI got very few female friends, and i fucked up like 100 times with them with dumb shit i did, now they already acesses my level as a man as just another dude and its fine i deserve it cuz thats what i am now, im not complaining or whatever, they dont deserve my sorry ass they deserve better men. \n\nSince 4th grade ive been a black sheep, i remember wanting to be friends with this kool kid and failing with silent rejection, i ended being best friends with the ugly kid or the person that had the same friendship or people problems (as in, making a lot of friends, being able to socialize effencienly.etc) im still friends with him and hold him in my heart, ill never forget him. But yeah, the girls where with the men that knew how to socialize efficienly and control the stuff in their heads or be likeable, put bluntly, they statisfy the evolucionary needs or fullfiled the nature of humanity, they knew how to deal with people, how to fit in. Im not one of those people, im twisted (someone told me this), i have manic attacks, i talk too fast, i act narccisitic sometimes, im become too clownly, generally, i just make people feel different or unique about me or i hold back a lot of who i am, its just that every relationship (if given the time) ive had its allways marked by the idea that im unstable or i did sum dumb shit.\n\nAll this is possibly in my head and probally people just see me super normal, but the point is that the world where women are (sociality, order, normacly, human interaction about normal things) is one that i dont have time to adapt now, im very far from it, a lot of normal things like \"hanging out\" feel alien to me. I have what i need in terms of friends. I dont need nor deserve a girlfriend. Also im really just attracted to looks and all this gf thing in me i think comes from sexual desire, its not even real, i just want to have sex with the girl i saw, maybe its deeper, but i know for a fact that the only reason im even looking at her or talking and trying to get to know her its because she is pretty and has a great body. Im not even starting out with right intentions the fuck. \n\nI want to be happy with what im doing, to move past hight schook desire and be a man with a path, with no need for things that are unnesesary and have his mind only desire the completion of his goals. (If i have to get a gf or talk to women for this to work then wtf is the brain anymore)",

It\u2019s a normal process that no one should be ashamed of.  \nTheres no need for a sexual relationship with another person until your other plans are more complete.    \nYou can have friends and do your work.\nSatisfying your own sexual desires is far more convenient and less time consuming than hoping someone else will do it for you.",

The shitty thing about trauma is it stays stuck in loops as you explain until it\u2019s solved by a lot of support and a particular sequence. The good thing is, trauma-informed therapists understand the sequence and can help you unlock these patterns and be free of them once and for all. (This is also why doing exercises or trying to solve this yourself won\u2019t work and why it may even make things worse.) If you don\u2019t have the strength to find a therapist maybe ask a friend you trust to support you in getting the strength together to make this decision. University resources are a great place to start bc they may be more affordable but you have to be specific in finding someone with qualified experience in trauma. If you want relief and improvements from this whole experience I would highly recommend again Internal Family Systems or a therapist that is experienced with trauma. (They\u2019re the only ones who can truly support with trauma answers and solutions.) Here\u2019s the directory of level 3 IFS practitioners, you can search by state but many are available virtually.

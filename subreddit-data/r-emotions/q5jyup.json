    "postText": "I wake up sometimes and I have like no mood or maybe I have to many emotions going at once that it\u2019s hard for me to just focus on one and so i just kinda sit there and be. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m tryna be happy or sad or I\u2019m just upset and somethings bothering me.. I\u2019m literally in this meh mood. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about anything or that I am upset I just literally have no effort in me to figure out what emotion to put forward and then when I need to there always forced. People think I\u2019m in a bad mood all day when in reality I just have nothing to give. Is this just me? Like am I the only one who wakes up talkative and bubbly or even reserved and talks when they want to and then randomly just nothing the next: no talking, no effort, or feeling for much?",

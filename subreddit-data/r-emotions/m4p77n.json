    "postText": "I\u2019m not the type of person to say anything m, I\u2019m 18 I\u2019m young, a male, I got responsibilities, I\u2019m doing well in other aspects(at least I believe that) but I feel nothing. I pray and pray but I came to a conclusion that feeling empty is the way to go. \u201cYou should let you emotions out.\u201d I have, it doesn\u2019t work. I have..many times and it hasn\u2019t worked. Whether it be my family or Gf. So idk why I\u2019m doing this. Maybe I have reached another bottom level I thought I could never. I forgot the last time I celebrated my BDay. Ya it\u2019s not special but I wished one day that I would have a cake. Maybe it\u2019s the desires. But I\u2019m human. Maybe I\u2019m the problem but 9 years dealing with this. Trying to express myself from a hound age. Nothing. No change. So I\u2019m saying that maybe being empty is good. Dead eyes. At least I give a helping hand to others. But I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. I wanna be alone. I don\u2019t like human beings. I came to Reddit because Ik no one would care but I wanna leave something behind at least. Emptiness is an answer. Sometimes closing yourself off is good.",

            "comment": "I don't know what to say because I can be the same sometimes, I decide not to be around people and I want to close off. \n\nPeople tell me to express myself when I don't need to. Maybe you're the same; you don't need to express yourself. Being generally unemotional is a personality trait. And people can believe it's weird and may pressure you because of it, and that makes them tiring so you want to close off.\n\nI'd say yes, spend some time with yourself as an introvert, and remember there's no need to be emotional and expressive like others. Just be yourself.\n\nBut if you're trying to feel something and you can't even though you're happy overall, then it must be something psychological. Have you gone through depression/ anxiety? Or maybe it's anhedonia.",

I\u2019m kind of happy or idk surprised that there\u2019s someone similar like me out there. You lol. But hey brother maybe one day we\u2019ll be able to look at something or feel something and say \u201cwow this is nice.\u201d I had a quiet of misspells that\u2019s because I was half asleep lol. But Ik you guys understood me. Being alone feels good. Not dealing with anyone feels good.",

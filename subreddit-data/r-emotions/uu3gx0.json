I didn\u2019t really believe her when she first told me that but I am now realizing it\u2019s true. And it doesn\u2019t really make me empathetic, I just never took the time to listen to my emotions because I was focused on pleasing everyone else. \nShe tells me the way to change it is to take time to feel what\u2019s inside my body, stop doubting myself and a knowledge what my body is telling me. Turns out you have emotions you just don\u2019t listen to it",

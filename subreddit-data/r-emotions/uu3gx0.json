    "postText": "I never cry, I didn't even react much when my grandpa died, I just don't seem to care much about the world. I had been worrying if I was a psychopath or something but I read somewhere \"if you're worried about being a psychopath, you probably aren't since they don't/rarely feel guilty\" or something like that..? How can I be more emotional? Like, I don't really have many fears except losing the ones I love but when that actually happens I don't really react. Why am I so...neutral..? Is there something wrong with me? Can someone help? I want to be more emotional",

I didn\u2019t really believe her when she first told me that but I am now realizing it\u2019s true. And it doesn\u2019t really make me empathetic, I just never took the time to listen to my emotions because I was focused on pleasing everyone else. \nShe tells me the way to change it is to take time to feel what\u2019s inside my body, stop doubting myself and a knowledge what my body is telling me. Turns out you have emotions you just don\u2019t listen to it",

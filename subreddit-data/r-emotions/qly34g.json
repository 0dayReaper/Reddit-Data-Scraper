    "postText": "I (27m) have usually been more calm and patient towards others, but lately since I moved I have been having swings that don\u2019t go past name calling rude strangers and having violent thoughts. I\u2019ve expressed this to my people but they seem happy about it? To give a little context, I have been quite the pushover in the past and are probably glad to see me stand up for myself, but I have also struggled with mental illness and impulsive behavior. Just asking is there any other softies who slowly but surely snapped? Did your people reward the behavior or try to stop you acting out?",

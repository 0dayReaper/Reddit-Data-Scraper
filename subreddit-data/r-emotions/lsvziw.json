    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm currently running an online study for my masters in Psychology, and thought it might be of interest to this sub.\n\nIt takes 20 minutes and it's totally anonymous. There's a task where you match words that are alike; questions about how you experience and think about feelings; how you think you would respond to different imaginary situations; and how different images makes you feel. I've heard feedback that it's interesting to take part in because of the questions about emotions!\n\nIf you're interested, here's the link: [https://cacsss.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8IgrbOcEimRIeWi](https://cacsss.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8IgrbOcEimRIeWi)\n\nHope you enjoy, cheers!",

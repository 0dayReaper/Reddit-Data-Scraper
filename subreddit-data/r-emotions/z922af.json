            "comment": "This helped me better understand my childhood. My parents were not abusive in an overt sense but they were passively (its funny how my mind doesn\u2019t want to know this.) i did feel confused and disappointed as a child because my feelings and thoughts were not heard. I have frequent fear that this happen and panic when i do.\n\nMy parents didnt display emotion and also would trivialize responses. I am sure they jad authentic momenta but I have a tendency to believe what they do intentionally (trivialize, mask.)\n\nI carry these things with me and do them. I trivialize others needs and fear intimacy. I don\u201dt think I have a place to reliably practice them which has slowed down building habits.",

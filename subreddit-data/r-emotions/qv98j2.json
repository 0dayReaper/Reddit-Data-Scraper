    "postText": "This story is a continuation of the story \"Will Meet Soon\" which i posted on \"StoryTime\" few days ago. To feel connected to the story, i recommend you all to read \" Will Meet Soon\" before you read this. Here's a link to it :   [Will Meet Soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryTime/comments/qfjr4a/will_meet_soon/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nAugust 23, 2021 was the day when she posted a beautiful pic dressed in traditional style with the same moon like smile which melts heart in seconds. She isn't very much into social media's, posting 1 or sometimes no pic in a month. It becomes unbearable if allowed to wait for so long to know how she's doing specially when you haven't even met her in real life and you're still a stranger to her. But trust me, it really worths. Just when a notification pops up by insta saying she posted a pic, my thumb becomes faster than the speed of light and after i see her, my heart melts more quickly than an icecream melts. But something happened on 15th of November which freezed this molten heart into an iceberg. \n\nNovember 14, 2021, the Children's day \ud83c\udf89, the teachers of our school were well prepared to entertain and motivate us. Me and my freinds were eagerly waiting for a mimic of one of my freinds (A Topper) which was to be performed by our physics teacher but little did we know that he was about to reveal the final examination datesheets in his act. We all were amazed and shocked at same time. While everyone seemed busy in digesting the revelation, i was lost in my own world, thinking what happens if the history repeats? What happens if i again see my beloved  near bus station just like i saw her the last year? I    went into dreams imagining the entire scene of our second meeting. I saw her again and this time i came out of my school bus and approached her, confessed my feelings and got accepted! We two hugged each other and everyone out there, stucked in the traffic, came out of their vehicles to clap. In reality, i was actually hugging my best freind\ud83d\ude06. He was witty and in return, hugged me. Three seconds later he screamed in my ears: \" I love you honey \" \ud83d\ude06. I fell from my chair and almost got a heart attack \ud83d\ude11. He nearly made me half deaf and he was proud of his act \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude06. The excitement to see her and that beautiful 5-6 mins of day dreaming that i had, made me so happy that i forgot to sleep that night.  \n\nNovember 15, 2021, woke up pretty late, around 10.30 in the morning. After having shower, i was about to have breakfast when a notification popped from insta saying she posted a pic. My thumb gained the speed of light and within milliseconds i opened the post. She was looking gorgeous \ud83e\udd7a and a guy was behind her who had his arms around her shoulder. He looked older than her, probably 23-24 i guess? And she is 18, so i assumed him as her brother. I was so much busy in adoring her eyes that i forgot to read the caption which said : \" Sometimes i look at my boyfriend and think, Damn! He is one lucky man.\"\n\nMind: So it ended? \n\nHeart: Umm........No comments!",

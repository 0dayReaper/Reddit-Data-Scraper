    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi to whoever may read this, I'm not sure if I'll ever share this to another soul rather than my own.\n\nI must thank you because I trusted this to you about my broken mind. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is that's completely broken or how to fix it but I know something up there is like shattered glass and it\u2019s starting to cut all other parts of function in my brain.\n\nSo where is it shattered? Or rather broken you might ask? I don\u2019t know. Isn\u2019t that odd, everything on this planet has some source. Something that causes it to do something. I can\u2019t pinpoint my source. It\u2019s scary all I know is, I\u2019m not okay. \n\nI try so hard to be the best I can but all I can ever do is cry and sleep. I try to make the people around me happy but I feel like I drag them down and make them upset. It\u2019s a hard life but that\u2019s all I do. I\u2019ve worked so hard to be great for someone but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m awful, or at least that's what the 500th shard of glass tells me while it digs deeper into my frontal lobe. It\u2019s almost as if it broke and poison was on each and every piece of glass as they burrowed in my brain to cause a poisonous effect. \n\nMy wife. Where can I start. I love her, I love her more than anything on this planet. But the poison in my brain hurts me everytime I start to think of devious thoughts. She\u2019s always promised I\u2019m the man for her, but the poison says she never believed that in the first place. She says she wants to spend her life with me, and she\u2019s working so hard for me to get there but the poison says it\u2019s a facade to keep me on my toes and keep me around.\n\nThe poison in my brain is awful. It hurts every part of my life. Sometimes it even makes me fear that it isn\u2019t poison at all. That\u2019s scary the thought that the glass shards aren\u2019t glass at all. But needles full of vaccines to heal my broken mind rather than poison to kill it. Because what if the poison isn\u2019t wrong? It\u2019s an odd thought because I think of it as poison but it\u2019s just like eating food that\u2019s bitter and disgusting but is good for your body. \n\nSometimes I don\u2019t want to swallow that pill. Because if that pill is correct, my broken mind is truly destroyed. In the midst of that destroyed mind, through the fires and floods I will be standing there; by my lonesome. A thought not even I want to tackle. It\u2019s unbelievable but it\u2019s the truth. I have these people surrounding me that support me, but a broken mind can only heal as much as the mind's owner will let it. You can\u2019t rely on anyone but yourself at a certain time and point. No one will be awake 24/7, that\u2019s scary. I already hate leaving the glass shards in my mind alone. It\u2019s almost as if when the silence surrounds me at any time the glass turns into daggers with a mind of their own. They can drive deeper and deeper at their own accord.\n\nSilence brings pain.\n\nSilence also brings peace.\n\nBeing alone brings tears.\n\nBeing alone brings nirvana. \n\nIt\u2019s like if yin and yang were a coin. Sometimes I get the dark with a little light, or the light with a little dark; It\u2019s all up to the flip of a coin. The only difference being the odds are not 50/50 more like 25/75.\n\nBut I will continue this battle for hoping one day this poison is purged. Proven that this poison isn\u2019t a truth just a hateful life plaguing my mind everyday. Proving that I am stronger than the broken glass in my brain. \n\nI just hope it never turns out to be a vaccine. That\u2019s my worst fear. For that day I will fall into a pit of despair; one with walls so smooth you can roll a ball straight up, and darkness so dark even the darkest shadow would be afraid. \n\nThat\u2019s my fear.",

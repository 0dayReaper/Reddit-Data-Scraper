    "postText": "Last night my closest friend told me that I was the reason they were still alive, and I really don't how I feel. Not to long after we started texting and seeing each other on a regular basis, they shared with me that they were suicidal. So I became vigilant with checking on them and let them know that I was always available. One night, I received a random text from them. The text was vague, and asked that no blame their ex. I texted back, and then called when they did not respond. I didn't quit until they responded and then smothered them in love and encouragement. We never spoke of it again. That was about six months ago. Last night they shared that I stopped them from taking their life that night, and gave them a reason to live. How does the ego handle this?",

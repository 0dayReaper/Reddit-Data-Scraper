    "postText": "my friends only were my friends whilst it was no work to be my friend, as long as we went to school or work together they would act like friends but as soon as i dropped out they stopped writing me. now at my job i feel like i dont have any connection to the people there. they dont hate me, they probably like and maybe think im funny or sth but noone would consider me their friend.\n\nmy boyfriend wants to break up with me if we dont change ourselves in a year and if he does that ill be completely alone.\n\nplus i have been feeling very emoty lately. my job is stressing me out a lot, the stress is giving me a rash on my face, headaches, intrusive thoughts, and i cant deal with this anymore. ive been feeling so good until i started my job. i didnt drink as much, i didnt hurt myself, i didnt try to kill myself. now i feel like im out of my body, i dont know what or if im feeling, everythings faded, shallow, it doesnt get through to me. i miss whole conversations with people because it just seems like my ears arent processing the sounds, i cant read cause my eyes arent processing the words. i stay still for long times on end, just fiddeling with my fingers. it seems like my brain is shutting down to protect me or something. but it also makes me feel less love for my boyfriend, i dont want to do anything anymore, im back to drinking nearly every day, im crying for no reason, im not feeling any appetite except for when im drunk.\n\ni want to quit my job because i feel like its destroying me but also not destroying me enough. im stuck in the middle. im not feeling well enough to enjoy anything, but i also dont feel bad enough to end it all. i dont know what to do anymore. i want it to stop, i just want to feel fine for once.\n\nit sometimes gets so bad that i detach from my body so strongly, that i cant feel my legs or sometimes arms, i cant move, i dont feel when its too hot or too cold, i cant speak, i cant think at all.\n\ni told my boyfriend that im probably gonna be fine if we break up, at least after a while. but i know that as soon as we break up i will get drunk and jump of a bridge. i cant tell him that cause i want the best for him and i dont want him to not break up with me because hes worried about me. i want him to be able to break up with me when he feels like its the better option for him. i wont hate him for that either, i noticed how im pulling him down cause my mind is so fucked up and i myself have thought about breaking up with him so he can find someone better but i just cant. i love him so much.",

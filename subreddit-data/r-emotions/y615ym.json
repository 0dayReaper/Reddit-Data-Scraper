    "postText": "Im going to try and put this as well as I can describe it but it just feels so fucked up guys. So my all my life I\u2019ve been what I imagine as normal like I\u2019ve been sad angry and happy. But starting like a year ago I\u2019ve stopped being sad when It comes to other people I still feel sadness but only when I\u2019m the one being affected. Recently my teacher died of cancer who I respect a lot my grandpa is very sick and I think is near his time and my friend killed herslef my friend are becoming distant and my relationship with me mom has only been getting worse over the past couple months. And I feel nothing. Something I haven\u2019t brought up yet is that when I heard about my grandpa and teacher I was holding back fucking laughter. I feel fucking disgusting I don\u2019t even get sad anymore I\u2019ve just gottten angry for no reason. Sorry this might not sound right please ask question if this doesn\u2019t make sense I just want to know what the problem with me is.",

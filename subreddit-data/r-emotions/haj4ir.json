    "postText": "I cry almost everyday, some of the time it\u2019s cause I saw something sad on the internet, other times it\u2019s cause something sad happened, or maybe I just feel bad about myself. I do cry a lot sometimes I cry multiple times a day. I don\u2019t think I have depression though because I\u2019m a relatively happy person, and I don\u2019t feel extremely sad throughout the day. I don\u2019t really mind crying either, it helps me feel better. But is this bad or unhealthy? I feel fine I just get emotional a lot.",

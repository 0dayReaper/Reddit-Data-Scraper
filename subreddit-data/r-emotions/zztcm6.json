The guy in the equation is a 30 something male suffering from depression and the woman (also 30 something female ) was trying to cheer him up. It was a serious relationship",

Creating misunderstandings can hurt him a lot (which she might not realise). This is not the right way to cheer someone up.\n\nIf she loves him, that\u2019s great though! Wish them luck ^-^",

    "postText": "when i was younger if i were getting yelled by a parent or something, i would need to cry but i always was able to hold it in until i got to my room. now as a 21 year old, if my parents yell at me (not really yell since i\u2019m so much older but kinda scold me) i\u2019m not even able to hold that in until i get to my room and i\u2019ll start crying right in front of them. also, i used to be able to hold tears in when arguing with friends , but every time i argue with my friend i cry right in front of him and can\u2019t get myself to stop. i\u2019m wondering if this has happened to anyone else as they\u2019ve gotten older &amp;&amp; does anybody have any answers as to why it\u2019s like this now ?",

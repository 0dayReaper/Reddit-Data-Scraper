    "postText": "Doing a study on emotions and I wanted to glean from different fields (Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Religion, Theology, Anthropology, etc), and understand how different domains understand emotions.\n\nBelow are a handful of questions that would help me understand your/your field's perspective. (Granted, given your field/background and beliefs, not all questions will be applicable):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* What's the definition of an emotion?\n* What's the difference between emotions, feelings, and sensations, if any?\n   * (i.e. if anxiety is described by some fields primarily by physiological sensations, do we classify pain, hunger, sleepiness, as emotions as well?)\n* Is stress an emotion?\n* Are there emotions that only humans, as a species, experience?\n* What are the purposes of emotions?\n* Is there a distinction between a person and their emotions? \"You are not your thoughts\" is a common phrase; does your field recognize a distinction between one and one's emotions/thoughts?\n   * (i.e. common dichotomies used are: Self vs. Feelings, Consciousness vs. Thoughts, Spirit vs. Soul, Mind vs. Body, etc.)\n* Are emotions such as \"joy, love, peace, hope\" different than emotions such as \"fear, depression, anger\" that are more easily identified\n* If you believe certain emotions are morally wrong / \"sinful\" (anger, anxiety, depression), is someone responsible for expressing sinful emotions purely from an external, chemical agent (medications etc.) ?\n* What are some ways/techniques to regulate and manage emotions?",

I feel good... When I feel bad I feel bad. There isn't a lot of though behind my emotions",

Maybe it\u2019s interesting for you to see words that resonate w how you\u2019re feeling and for her to know you tried sth to participate. You don\u2019t have to do anything ofc but if you\u2019re interested in taking another step there are useful ways to begin.",

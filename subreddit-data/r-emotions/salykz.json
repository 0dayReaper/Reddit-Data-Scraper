It's bugging me!\n\nEver since I was a kid I've yearned for fictional characters I liked to be real and become upset and even distressed because of course a fictional character will never be real. \n\nThe reason I'm making a post about this is because I'm a grown adult and yet I still get these feelings. I want to try and start a dialogue with others that might have had similar experiences, or even try and figure out why I might be experiencing these emotions.",

All the characters that have invoked the feeling I've described have had something I want in one way or another. \n\nI dunno if a subreddit centered around books would help me figure out these feelings a little better \ud83d\ude05\n\nEither way this all just silly, so responses and such aren't urgent. It's just something I was hoping others experienced as well so we could discuss it together",

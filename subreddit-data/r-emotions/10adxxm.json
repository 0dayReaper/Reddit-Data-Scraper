    "postText": "Hi there, please could you share your thoughts and opinions on this? I could really do with some extra perspectives, to make sense of my own.\n\nI recently became aware that people experience emotions and feelings in very different ways, with very different intensities. My friend stated that she experiences the feeling of upset as like a 'weight' acting on her body, or that feeling happy makes her literally feel lighter and more bouncy (as in sensations, not metaphorical). It occurred to me that I normally identify how I'm feeling through tell-tale signs from my body, rather than from directly 'feeling' an emotion. E.g I know I'm angry when my voice changes or my face twitches, whereas my friend says she literally feels hot and experiences pain when angry.\n\nI'm assuming this ability to directly detect sensations from emotions is on a scale, with some people more and less sensitive to them? I recently found out that I'm neurodiverse, so I'm wondering if that could be impacting my experience with my emotions (google has made me aware of Alexithymia, which I'm going to look into properly soon). I'm a guy in my 20s, which also comes up a lot when discussing emotions and experiences with them. Please let me know how you experience emotions and if my way is typical. Sorry if someone has asked something similar before. I scrolled for a little while but gave up. Thanks in advance!",

And whenever I'll be happy, I talk a lot and get excited. So yeah. Sometimes some emotions are so weird that I don't get what I am feeling. So yeah. But right now my days are going very bleak, so I haven't experienced the emotion of happiness for a long time now.",

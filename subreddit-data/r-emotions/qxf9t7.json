    "postText": "Recently my teacher created a classroom call Counselling Classroom where everybody of my age hangs out together. There, people create drama, share stories, talk random things and share memes. I was more fond on making fictional stories as it expressed my emotions. But what makes me feel me feel a little of is the fact that while others have great reviews and comments, mine were almost ignored. I thought that it was because my writing skills were not good, but when I compared mine to the others, there was not much of a difference.   \n\n\nAt first, I ignored it completely and continued, but it was starting to get on me because while I spend almost 1-3 hours a day writing it and get ignored, the trolls at the classroom gets 100-200 comments. The other authors are no exception. It made me really sad because that was not my first time. I got ghosted by my friends since I was 4. They completely ignored me and when I went to primary school, waiting for a fresh start, the cycle repeated again. I got fed up and when I turned 9, I started befriending male classmates instead. There was one named Milton who made me feel comfortable and we were friends for a long time. We went to the same high school and the pandemic hit. At first, we still kept in touch and as months pass by, he ghosted me.   \n\n\nWas it because I was bad at my stories? I was not involved in any drama at my class so I really weirded me out. Can you guys leave in the comments what I have done?",

The ones that do give everything they have,\ud83d\ude4b, always get shit on but always come back for more. It's like it's never enough. I understand how you are feeling. I get there and bounce out of it. My suggestion to you would be to take a day or two completely away from social media, your phone or whatever it is that influences you. Take that time and just relax, meditate, do some yoga or go for a walk. Just a little time and maybe you can get back into your own thoughts. Alot of us become what we constantly see. I wouldn't say depression but I feel you may be circling the hole. Keep your head up and you always have people who will listen to you",

            "comment": "Find a high energy emotion, like anger or fear. Check to see if your angry about not caring, if not find something that makes you angry or scared. Use your anger or fear to scream and shout and make weird noises for like a minute to a few hours. Let whatever frustration or sadness that has built up overtime out, if crying continue to cry. Once the process happens then focus on the content. It's so much easier when some emotional need is met to deal with truth.",

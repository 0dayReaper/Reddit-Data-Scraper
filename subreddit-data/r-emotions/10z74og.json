    "postText": "I (23f) never really feel sad. I\u2019m not sure why, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s something wrong with me. I haven\u2019t cried in years and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. I feel everything else, I just don\u2019t ever feel sad. I know my dominant emotion is anger. Where other people usually feel sad I just feel angry. I also have never been one too express my emotions. I wouldn\u2019t say I push them down. If something needs to be said, I have zero problem saying it. I just think my emotions are mine, they\u2019re private. I feel like if I was to tell someone about how I feel I\u2019d be standing on a stage in front of everyone I know naked. I\u2019m also not big on physical touch, when friends and family touch me it makes me noticeably uncomfortable. S/o can touch me but it can\u2019t be constant or what I consider too much. I need a break after awhile.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you\u2019re purposely trying to avoid emotions/ sadness in particular. Feeling angry instead of sad could be because your mind is trying to protect you from feeling sad. Honestly I\u2019d rather be angry than sad. Not being one to express your emotions probably means you were never taught to. Or that when you did you never got any validation from it. Or that your parents/whoever raised you never showed you that it was okay to have emotions hence that\u2019s why you can\u2019t express emotions to other people and have trouble feeling them yourself. Maybe your emotions are blocked. If you feel like it\u2019s a problem and preventing you from living the life you want to live, then you could look into therapy. If you don\u2019t want to go that route, then maybe start practicing with feeling your emotions more and recognizing when your mind mind be trying to block them. Sharing your feeling with strangers is sometimes easier than with people you know. Baby steps.",

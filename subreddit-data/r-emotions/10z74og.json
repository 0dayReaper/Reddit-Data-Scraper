            "comment": "It sounds like you\u2019re purposely trying to avoid emotions/ sadness in particular. Feeling angry instead of sad could be because your mind is trying to protect you from feeling sad. Honestly I\u2019d rather be angry than sad. Not being one to express your emotions probably means you were never taught to. Or that when you did you never got any validation from it. Or that your parents/whoever raised you never showed you that it was okay to have emotions hence that\u2019s why you can\u2019t express emotions to other people and have trouble feeling them yourself. Maybe your emotions are blocked. If you feel like it\u2019s a problem and preventing you from living the life you want to live, then you could look into therapy. If you don\u2019t want to go that route, then maybe start practicing with feeling your emotions more and recognizing when your mind mind be trying to block them. Sharing your feeling with strangers is sometimes easier than with people you know. Baby steps.",

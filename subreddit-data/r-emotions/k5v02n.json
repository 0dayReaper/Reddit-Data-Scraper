    "postText": "I\u2019m not even sure where to begin but I\u2019ll try. I have a long history of mental illness and substance abuse. Even on my better days, my mind always feels like a bunch of wires tangled together in a ball and it\u2019s maddening trying to sort it all out; but being open and honest with others has never gone well or gotten me anywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see any benefit in sharing my problems and emotions with people; especially because, for various reasons, lots of people have always tried to pry into and strong arm their way into my personal affairs but never in a way to help; just to be gossipy and because they feel the need to make my business their business which has jaded me beyond belief. When I did open up to them (again, mainly because I felt pressured into doing it) i\u2019d swear them to secrecy only to have all of them tell everyone what I had said which was extremely violating.\n\nI was once telling a friend of mine that I was having a bad time when she suddenly snapped at me \u201cOh my god, you are such a whiner!\u201d And that she was irritated with and disappointed in me for \u201cnot being the strong, confident person [she] thought [ I] was.\u201d Granted, her saying this to me is the pot calling the kettle black as she was the queen of making everyone listen to her problems (which was usually about her high speed revolving door of relationships) and have everyone be sympathetic, but what she said really cut me to the core and has always stayed with me. All this makes me keenly aware that once you say something, you can\u2019t take it back so I just prefer to keep things to myself and keep things airy and on the surface with other people. \n\nAlso, in my experience, people trying to \u201chelp me\u201d has always blown up in my face. Some have genuinely wanted to help but went about doing so in all the wrong ways, some have jumped on it as an opportunity to manipulate and control me while others just sort of shrug and absentmindedly say something like \u201cthat\u2019s life\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s made me really grow to like the idea of bottling up emotions, being secretive and evasive about myself and not letting myself be any degree of vulnerable. It\u2019s like having armor that protects me and makes sure I\u2019m the only one in control of my life, tightly regulating what I let in or out and that others can\u2019t screw me over or claim me a burden. You know, damage control. I want to be strong and self sufficient and go it alone with nobody\u2019s help. I really like the idea of being that person, that\u2019s who I want to be.\n\nSo is that really such a bad thing to do given my terrible history of experiences? And the fact that talking about my problems and emotions has never improved anything or helped in anyway, made people irritated and angry at me and overall usually making things worse? Maybe doing what I\u2019m doing is the better choice for some people.",

    "postText": "I've been able to hold in my emotions for years. I never complained, I never got in fights, I never disobeyed, I was perfect. But I can do that anymore, for the past month I've been lashing out with anger hurting the people I love, ruining friendship and stuff, and I've been crying which feels weird because I haven't cried before, I'm not saying I never wanted to cry, I was just raised by the \"men don't cry\". But I'm mainly concerned about the anger people care if their friends get hurt, not if some jerk cries",

This was due to my father but i may not know the reason for why you are angry but what i can tell is that its okay to let out your anger.\n\nSomething must have happened and thats why you may be feeling angry. Maybe its something you ate going through and noone knows about it. Has i said, I've also had sad and angry emotions before but once i began to process those emotions i better understood why i was feeling that way.\n\nI hope you can better process your emotions and be free. Anger can kill you lol just joking but seriously work on your emotions.",

I exhausted all my emotions especially when I was angry but it was just not worth it. I don't really talk to anyone about how i feel especially my family. Like i guess being in an African family can be tough.\n\nWhat i can say is if you are being slapped for showing your emotions, i would suggest saving up money and moving out. Its probably the best for everyone.\n\nWhat i can tell is that because I've suppressed my feelings for so long i feel alone even if i family because no one really understands me.",

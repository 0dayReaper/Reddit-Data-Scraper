    "postText": "I have a very hard time moving on from the past. Especially if I experience a \u201cgood time\u201d. For example, if i have a good year or a good couple of months, i will compare every single experience of mine to that time span. It\u2019s getting to the point where I can\u2019t be content unless I am experiencing what I experienced during that good time. I\u2019ll try to recreate the past just to feel something, anything, that I felt during that time. Like going to the same stores, wearing similar clothes, talking/hanging out with the same people, watching the same shows, really anything that happened during that good time. Sometimes I\u2019ll succeed, but deep down I know it\u2019s not the same. It upsets me because my mind will wander to the that time and I\u2019ll think, \u201ci wish i could experience this time again. I wish i could be sent back in time just to be there again.\u201d And just knowing the present isn\u2019t \u201cthe same\u201d or \u201cgood enough\u201d because it\u2019s not like that time takes a emotional toll on me.\nI know how to let go of the past when it comes to negative aspects. But how do I let go of the past when it comes to positive aspects? How can I move on? Where would I even begin? How can I focus on the present without comparing it to the past?",

I do agree with you. During the good times, I always had a positive mindset and after reading you post maybe my good times weren\u2019t as good but they were because I viewed them that way. \nIt\u2019s definitely a work in progress and I do want to get to a point where I can enjoy every phase in my life without nostalgically looking back at the past.",

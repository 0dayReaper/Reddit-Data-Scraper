Sounds like you want the best for everyone and really do love them despite their own limitations.  Can imagine how hard it is wanting to have harmony, peace and healing for both of them and yourself. It\u2019s courageous to write and to make your emotions known so def big respect for that. Life can be so hard but good that you reach out. It\u2019s never enough to do it all alone so support in the right places can help you through anything.",

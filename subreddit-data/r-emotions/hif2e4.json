    "postText": "De-Mentalization\n\n\n\nStuck in time with a frozen heart, feeling lost during this lonely new start. \n\nAll these years that I left to waste, they still linger that dreadful taste.\n\nWith so many questions left without answer, it seems like this is the mental form of stage 4 cancer.\n\nI wonder why these days have to feel so cold, it's the hottest time of the year as I watch myself grow old.\n\nNot knowing how to find the strength to move on, when this whole time I didn't realize I was already gone.\n\nWhere do I find meaning in this life, when everything I believed in cut me down like a knife.\n\nI didn't even know I was living in the wrong, now I'm left with this pain inside that I've held on to for so long.\n\nBut I can't just let it go by my own free will, what is the answer to once again feel like I'm real?\n\nThey say time is what it takes to finally heal, but this cancer inside will only tries to kill.\n\nAs these days drag on and times get worse, I wish I could go back and do things in reverse.\n\nRemembering the day it all went away, when I chose this path that lead me astray.\n\nI know it's a long road that I have ahead, even as I lay here writing in my bed.\n\nWanting to escape these feelings that are all stiuck in my head, maybe they won't leave till the day that I'm dead.",

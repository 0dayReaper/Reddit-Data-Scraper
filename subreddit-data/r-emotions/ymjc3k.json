Dunno how to call it but I do have an instinct to seek out prey(?) sometimes(?) or sth like that\nFeels kinda like you described\nEnergetic, focused, ready to act, brain is entirely quiet- my perception is solely focused on the environment or what I\u2019m doing (though that might be a sign of dissociation for me), being tingly is a dissociative sign for me as well so if you don\u2019t have that tendency, it\u2019s probably sth else for you\n\nBefore anyone says anything- I don\u2019t use drink nor smoke, I\u2019m not into furries, high tier in mental function just with some trauma, no medical conditions.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not the answer you seek.\nBleh dunno.\nNot really that interested in its name, I perceive it as sth close to an instinct but for real it\u2019s sOmEtHiNg.\nWe still might be talking about different things.\nReally I probably wouldn\u2019t have written it not for the previous answer annoying me lol.\nIgnore this",

                    "comment": "\"...brain is entirely quiet... and solely focused on my environment\" That was accurate, and also a weird sensation when you have ADHD. Maybe that's what they mean by hyper focus?\n\nI wouldn't personally call it an instinct, but it does seem like it might be triggered by something like that.\n\n I don't have dissociative tendencies so we might be speaking of different things. Regardless I'm glad you responded. It's always nicer to have more perspectives to look through, especially when they're longer form. \n\nThank You!",

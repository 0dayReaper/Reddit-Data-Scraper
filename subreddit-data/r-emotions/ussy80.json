    "postText": "So let me clarify, For a long time I prided myself on feeling no emotions whatsoever. I thought it would make me cool. It wasn\u2019t until after high school where I realized my mistake. I burned a lot of bridges so I worked on opening up again, one day I was watching a movie called \u201cThe Giver\u201d (Fantastic Movie and Book I absolutely recommend). In the movie a song came on and suddenly I felt all the emotions I had avoided come to the surface. So when I want to feel something intense again I just listen to that song. \n\nIs there a song like that for anyone else?",

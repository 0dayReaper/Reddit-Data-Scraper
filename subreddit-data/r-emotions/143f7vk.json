    "postText": "I was accused of threatening violence but that's not my speed so I feel misunderstood and frustrated.\n\nI was talking about how suicide is wrong, except under rare circumstances such inextinguishable suffering and such, under which case one should do so legally and not vigilante style.\n\nBut I think I got misunderstood by something.\n\nViolence is wrong.  I had no intent to come off as threatening it. So I feel a bit victimized.\n\nIt's irritating you know?\n\nI feel alienated, and ganged up on.\n\nIt makes me feel smoll, and framed, and helpless.\n\nI want good reddit karma not to be accused of shit and told I'm off topic all the time.\n\nSo those are my emotions... *sigh*",

This is a social media platform and things can and will be taken 50000 different ways, that isnt a flaw in your character just something as simple as having this many humans anonymously and openly talking on a platform will always lead to misunderstandings.\n\nIf you rely on karma for self worth or to feel heard you will never truly find it.",

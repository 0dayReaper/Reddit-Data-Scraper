This is a social media platform and things can and will be taken 50000 different ways, that isnt a flaw in your character just something as simple as having this many humans anonymously and openly talking on a platform will always lead to misunderstandings.\n\nIf you rely on karma for self worth or to feel heard you will never truly find it.",

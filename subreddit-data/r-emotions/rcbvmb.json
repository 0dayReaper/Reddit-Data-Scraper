            "comment": "This is a great question from a very good observation. You're essentially asking about how other people have habituated their primary emotional response to stressful stimuli. Since we habituate our emotions based on every experience we've ever had in our life, it could be possible the answer to your question is that everyone in the world could have a unique set of emotional patterns they feel when they are highly stressed. On top of that, there are ways that we socialize emotions. Some emotions have different social acceptance between different cultures. And then within cultures, there is certain social acceptance between different factors like gender identity, race, socio-economic status, and physical ability. So while there may be an average answer to your question, it may differ between locations.",

When those feelings come up, just keep going. Don't give in to them. Change your physiology and shift your emotional state.  You need to control your emotions so you aren't controlled by them. \n\nYou can also think about when it's the end of your life. How would you feel if you looked back at all the things you didn't do because you cared so much about what other people think?",

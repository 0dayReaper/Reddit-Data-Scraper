    "postText": "About 3 days ago, I met this guy. We can call him D.  We became friends pretty quickly and there\u2019s been a lot of playfully flirty moments between us but you know, I assumed it was playful until he became a lot more clingy and whatnot with it. Eventually I\u2019d found out from other friends and himself he was interested in a guy named Jay (same as my name, crazy) and since that day I\u2019ve been a little bothered with it hit didn\u2019t let it stop me from doing anything I originally would with D.\n\nFast forward to today, It was my friends and I with Dan and we were all just being dummies and playing games together, just being friendly. We (D and I) play with each other the same way whether people are there or not, it doesn\u2019t bother us. I made a statement and he and his friend N began to start freaking until it took a shift and they started acting way weirder, like the conversation completely shifted and nobody else knew but those two.\n\nSooner or later, Jay was added into the group chat and it was a real shocker for me. And of course D and Jay talked the ENTIRE time and they were being pushed together by others because everyone knew how D felt and wanted to help him. \n\nMy main point here is I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it lately and it\u2019s been a huge bother, I also had a MASSIVE jealousy out break and had to turn my phone off a couple of times. I didn\u2019t ruin the mood with everyone else or anything, I made sure they all still had plenty fun and weren\u2019t bummed out but I was still really bothered.\n\nWhy am I so easily attached to people? That\u2019s my question.",

    "postText": "I am usually an empathetic person, emotionally driven, and sensitive.\nI do however, have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)/ Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD): which may attest to the emotions I often feel.\nDespite this, ever since a young age, I have always been able to \"turn off\" my emotions - that is, let them go. They arent suppressed or detached, I just make the conscious decision not to feel them anymore. \nI can be angry or joyous - and often times when I feel these extremes, I feel guilty at the same time; so I decide not to feel them anymore. I just stop feeling them, consciously. I stop \"listening\" to the emotion, and think of things logically. It's grounding in a way.\nI can do the same thing when I am too cold - when I'm shivering, I can stop shivering at will. Even though I acknowledge the fact I may be cold, I am able to stop my body's automated response to the stimulus.\nIt may be the same with emotions - I am able to stop feeling them, despite the natural urge to feel them. \nDoes anyone else experience this?",

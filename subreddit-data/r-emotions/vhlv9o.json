But the other day when I joined a space on Twitter and speaking I found myself being very tense and nervous. This was my first time speaking in a space on Twitter (I had listened to people talking in the community I was speaking in quite a lot before). Why would I get so nervous talking to new people online like that when I never do in real life?",

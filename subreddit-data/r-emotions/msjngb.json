    "postText": "i\u2019m having a breakdown over dungeons and dragons of all things. i play regularly with my friends over discord, and since covid it encompasses most of my social interaction. i rarely talk to my friends when not playing. and tonight i just realized i\u2019m so tired of the fun i have with my friends relying on me performing, on me being creative. Outside of this i\u2019m an artist and a writer and while i love doing all of these things i just feel so tired of having to be creative. i just want to be. i don\u2019t want to have to think up stories and characters and try to impress people and make them happy or live up to their expectations. i\u2019m so sensitive to criticism whenever anyone is slightly unhappy with something i create i spiral out of control. i just want it all to stop i want to stop playing this stupid game and subconsciously basing my worth off of what i create. i\u2019m just so tired.",

            "comment": "I would ask them if they have any ideas about what they would like to do next. Keep open to the criticism, and keep up your hard work. It is one of the most difficult things to do, to be creative for other people. Art made from yourself should express your genuine values from personal experience. There is no guarantee that others will enjoy it. Art made for others should have the values they get from preference. There is no guarantee all the people in the party will enjoy it, and it could become bland enough that it would be no fun for anyone involved. However, if you are willing to keep putting out your own work, and be willing to try and incorporate their ideas, I'm sure you will all have a better time. \n\nIt's just like Marvel movies. They make such a wide variety of characters, that it becomes difficult to make an individual storyline for just one character, so it's usually a blend of heroes in every movie.\n\nAlso check out my other response about sadness and loss.\n\nP.S. D&amp;D is the bomb! Artificers are what's up!",

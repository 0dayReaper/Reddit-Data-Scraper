    "postText": "I want to stop hating her, not because she deserves forgiveness, but because it just feels so consuming, so destructive, so counterproductive to happiness.  \n\n\nI don't want to give away specific details, so I will keep it general:  \n\\-We were best friends in the office.  \n\\-I developed romantic feelings for her.  \n\\-She had a boyfriend, so I felt my romantic feelings were inappropriate. I decided to end our friendship.  \n\\-Even though my romantic feelings were a good reason for us not to be friends anymore, she didn't care. She said she still wanted to be friends. She kept on trying to do things like jump into conversations I was having with other people, flirting with me to lead me on and not giving me space when I asked for it.  \n\\-She knew I was struggling with feelings for her, and wanted to get over her. Yet she kept vying for my attention. But I knew her boyfriend was a good, attractive guy, who she expressed no intention of breaking up with. So it just felt like a way to mess with my head and have power over me, because she liked the attention I used to give her.  \n\\-So I began avoiding her completely. Like I would be talking with some co-workers, and as soon as she joined the group, I would find an excuse to leave the group and do something else. I went to a different room if I saw her alone in a room. I came late to work, instead of early to the spot we used to hang out.  \n\\-She didn't like that I was avoiding her so much over several months. So she finally snaps: She shows my boss messages I sent to her in the past, that had mentions of my most embarrassing secrets and insecurities.  \n\\-She does it under the guise of me \"harassing\" her. They did the investigation, there was no evidence of harassment. So I feel she really just sent it to humiliate me.  \n\\-Even worse, she will be leaving this workplace in about a month. She couldn't leave in peace, she just had to embarrass me first.  \n\\-Now instead of romantic feelings, I have these uncontrollable feelings of anger, disgust and resentment. Like how could my former best friend, someone I did so much for, who I was nothing but nice to, humiliate me for wanting boundaries?   \n\\-Like I think about all the things I did to her, and really, I didn't do anything that bad. I never threatened her, never stalked her, never called her names, always tried to help her professionally if she needed it. The only bad thing I did was ignore her, and it was because I had inappropriate feelings for her that I wanted to get rid of.  \n\\-The worst part of all is feeling like I don't deserve this, like I did everything right, and yet I suffered this humiliation from someone I trusted.\n\nI don't know how to get past this. What do you do when you hate someone and want to stop hating them for your own mental health?",

Your post outlines all the reasons why your hate is justified. I found that the more we ruminate over why our hate is justified the less likely we will ever get to the place where we can forgive and move on.\n\nBest wishes on discovering that sweet spot where the bitterness fades and peace is restored.\n\n\\~Troy",

The boyfriend didn't respond, but I know he read the message because of the timestamp. So I honestly feel better knowing she got humiliated for her actions, after she tried to humiliate me.",

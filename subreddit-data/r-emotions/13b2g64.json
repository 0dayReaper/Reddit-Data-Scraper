Your post outlines all the reasons why your hate is justified. I found that the more we ruminate over why our hate is justified the less likely we will ever get to the place where we can forgive and move on.\n\nBest wishes on discovering that sweet spot where the bitterness fades and peace is restored.\n\n\\~Troy",

The boyfriend didn't respond, but I know he read the message because of the timestamp. So I honestly feel better knowing she got humiliated for her actions, after she tried to humiliate me.",

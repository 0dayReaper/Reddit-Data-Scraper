    "postText": "I love basketball with all my heart and always will. I have since I've started playing it. I was extremely nervous about tryouts, because I was that determined to make the team.\n\nSo, yesterday was the final day and I made it.\n\nUsually after something like this comes euphoria and happiness, but instead I feel \"meh\" and even a little bit of dread. Shouldn't I have been elated, at least momentarily? Besides, basketball is my passion and I have to feel something. I can't be numb because that would mean I don't care, but I do. \n\nThere are only four logical explanations.\n\n1: I saw it coming because I had some confidence in my abilities I was unaware of until now. \n\n2: The happiness is a delayed, detatched reaction.\n\n3: Something (depression?) is causing me not to feel happy.\n\n4: It hasn't sunk in and registered yet that something good has happened.\n\nI'm so confused.",

While all the 4 reasons you listed are plausible explanations, as a therapist I know that sometimes, even the positive experiences in life can bring stress. It might be helpful to introspect on whether there is any aspect of this situation that is making you apprehensive or something you are worried about. We often have some worries that might inhibit our ability to experience joy to the extent possible, about something.\n\nTake a little time to reflect on this and write down:\n\n1. Anything that worries/scares you about this - why are you experiencing a feeling of dread? \n2. Everything you're excited about! \n\nNote down anything that comes to mind! This process can help gain a new renewed perspective!\n\nRemember, It's okay not to have the expected reaction, it can be more frustrating questioning it!

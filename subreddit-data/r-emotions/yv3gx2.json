    "postText": "\n1) Recognize and allow the emotion.\nexample: I feel bad, I feel hate. I allow myself to feel and I give it space.\nI will not do harm, I can control myself.\nNo judging, it's just an emotion.\n\n2)Observe the emotion\nWhere do you feel it in the body?\nYou are not the emotion, you're just the observer.\nAnalogy : The emotion is like a wave in the ocean. Don't try to fight the wave.\n\n3) Be present.\nUse 5 senses.\nWhat are you feeling, hearing, seeing, touching, tasting ?\n\n4) Breathing\nTry breathing techniques like the square breathing\n4 inhale 4 staying, 4 exhale, 4 staying.",

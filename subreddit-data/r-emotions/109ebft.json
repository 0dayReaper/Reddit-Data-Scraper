    "postText": "So here's my thing, I have a personality of an angel, at least that's what others say, I am very kind and too kind for this world. So, I have difficulty tuning in with my emotions, for example feeling sadness, anger, or any really, most I do feel is happiness, when watching something that I like or doing my hobby, that's when I feel positive emotions. Next thing, I feel empty at the same time, like when I stop doing my hobby or playing games on pc or anything I was really doing, I feel empty, sad, or alone. Like it's the feeling I just want to cry out my emotional baggage, last time I cried was 12 years ago, and not ever since.  \n\n\nI have tried lots of things at least what I read online, listening to sad songs, watching a sad movie or a movie that used to make me cry when I was a kid or anything really, even writing down my emotions, channeling, nothing really does help, it's like sadness/emptiness is like my default goto emotion and I have always been asked by my dad why do you look sad, I just shrug my shoulders and responded, there's nothing to be happy with and that was 10 years ago when I was 14 and now 24 but still I just feel like I want to cry one evening, like a cry out loud and for real for good 5 minutes but I just can't get myself to cry.",

Just sit and feel without judgement. Just observe your body and mind. With the knowledge of the different levels of needs it will be easier to pinpoint where there is a lack or too much.\n\nJust imagine you needs as some buckets. They need to be filled, in balance and at a certain level to give you the feeling that you're okay.\n\nMost important is taking care of your physical health, because all you do in your life is using your body and your mind (which is dependend on the fitness of your body) to achief fulfillment of your needs. And that takes energy and resources from your body. That's what living is all about.",

Just sit and feel without judgement. Just observe your body and mind. With the knowledge of the different levels of needs it will be easier to pinpoint where there is a lack or too much.\n\nJust imagine you needs as some buckets. They need to be filled, in balance and at a certain level to give you the feeling that you're okay.\n\nMost important is taking care of your physical health, because all you do in your life is using your body and your mind (which is dependend on the fitness of your body) to achief fulfillment of your needs. And that takes energy and resources from your body. That's what living is all about.",

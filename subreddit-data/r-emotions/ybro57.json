    "postText": "I'm going to a big social event tomorrow and I'm very anxious about it. I'm an introvert who doesn't like to go to such events where there are a lot of people. This is my first time going there that's why I'm nervous. But everyone else is going and I don't want to be left out. I mean what if I actually enjoy the event? Still, I can't help but feel nervous. I'm afraid I won't be able to find my friends there and am going to be alone. This is a big deal for me since I don't usually do these things. But I've decided to go so I can't cancel it. I hope everything goes well. But what can I do to make myself less anxious?",

Thanks for writing. \n\nThis isn\u2019t medical advice but if you want to find exercises try \u2018simple exercises to calm the vagus nerve\u2019 .. two useful ones that are simple are just breathing in and out as calmly as you\u2019re able and counting to ten (classic and clich\u00e9 but helpful), you can repeat this if you\u2019d like by going up to ten then back down to one, and it\u2019ll give you a rhythm that\u2019s calming. \n\nAlso, the central nervous system likes the vibration of the body when making the sound VOOOO.. so, breathing in and out calmly you can make this sound on the exhale and see if it works. \n\nThere may be some more coping tips in /socialanxiety\n\nThanks for sharing here and it\u2019s really courageous you decided to go. Hope it\u2019s a nice experience for you!",

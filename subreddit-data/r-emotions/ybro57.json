Thanks for writing. \n\nThis isn\u2019t medical advice but if you want to find exercises try \u2018simple exercises to calm the vagus nerve\u2019 .. two useful ones that are simple are just breathing in and out as calmly as you\u2019re able and counting to ten (classic and clich\u00e9 but helpful), you can repeat this if you\u2019d like by going up to ten then back down to one, and it\u2019ll give you a rhythm that\u2019s calming. \n\nAlso, the central nervous system likes the vibration of the body when making the sound VOOOO.. so, breathing in and out calmly you can make this sound on the exhale and see if it works. \n\nThere may be some more coping tips in /socialanxiety\n\nThanks for sharing here and it\u2019s really courageous you decided to go. Hope it\u2019s a nice experience for you!",

    "postText": "I saw a similar post and I thought I should share my feelings too I guess... I think about relationships and me being alone all the time. I love being alone but especially today its valentines day, I feel alone today. I want a relationship but I don't. Its complicated. I see all these relationships and I want one but then its like I don't, I find them ugh.... like I don't know. I'm also confused about life in general, I know my purpose but I feel like I'm missing something and I don't know what it is. I feel kinda lost and I don't know. I wanted to cry today and I even feel.... honestly I need to. I'm also not sure if I am scared to be alone or I don't like being alone. Which it wouldn't make sense because I love being alone... I'm happy that I'm not with someone but then I just want those affectionate stuff. But I just don't want to be the only one who feels this way.",

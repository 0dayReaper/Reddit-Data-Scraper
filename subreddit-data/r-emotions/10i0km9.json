All our psychological form of interaction with other (eg. from affects) is a spatial interaction. Well, he studies groups not the single individual. You canno't study space or define space withou at last two objects for a bi-diminsion, or 3 for a three dimensional fild\n\nAlso: affects has valence, this means a positive and a negative. Positive affects is a reinforce, capture the subject, approach the subject and the behavior to the  source. Source can be other external object. But you see there is an interaction between two objects in a virtual space. You can call this interaction gravity. You see there is a tendency of repetition, increased frequency of the same positive affect occour again in a set circular time (as cyrcadian rhytms of positive affects, for eg. Search for that, very intersting). Can this be compared to a obejct captures by gravity and in orbit ??\n\nIf emotions has valence this means the space has at last 2 dimensions. One positive and one negative. In other words, an emotion means a interaction of at last  two objects in the virtual space. Depending on the referential, and the position between this two objects (one +1, other -1) the valence is defined. One object is  always you, the other is anything outside ? Well there should be many other QUALITATIVE dimensions that we do not have any parameter or similar in our \"real\" space.\n\nEdit: also you know that positive affects interfere each other increasing it intensity ?  Thats why people who see desesperately for good emotions like drug users, use many kind of dopamine sources at once (drugs, alchool, videogame, sex, m\u00fasic etc ...). We all do that, we tend to sum the frequencies of diferente positive affects sources at once. \nSo, you can compare this to two gravitional sources who interfere each other.",

    "postText": "To be completly honest with you I feel like people doesn't really know themself, i would start off by sitting on your bed and just think, seriously just think. And then you could find what remarkable thing you are doing wrong, if you can\u2019t find that you need to dive deeper.\n\nI would then invest in a mood ring og emotional ring, why? Because then you can trurly see witch emotion you are feeling at the moment. It sees your temperatur and your overall emotions and changes color.\n\nI bought the ring here: [Emotionrings.com](https://Emotionrings.com) \n\nAfter that I would use the ring actively, and then try meditation. Just meditate for 10 min everyday. \n\nThen i would talk to myself outloud, i have found that is a great way to help myself sort my thoughts.\n\nIf you need more advices just send me a pm\u2764\ufe0f",

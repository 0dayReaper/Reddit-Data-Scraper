    "postText": "Ok like the title said this is probably stupid but I was just wondering. So I\u2019m an extremely emotional person. Over emotional, too emotional probably idk there\u2019s too much basically I just cry crazy easily and very often. And so I\u2019m rewatching a comfort show of mine it\u2019s very cheesy but I like it but it keeps making me cry and I do that so much anyway it\u2019s kinda annoying. \n\nBut anyway I started thinking, if I keep watching stuff that makes me cry, will I be out of tears for all the inappropriate situations I cry in? Or will I just be tired and still cry when I don\u2019t want to bc my body hates me?",

            "comment": "Crying is very good for your mental and physical health and helps release pent up feelings. If you cry intentionally in the right way, it can provide an emotional release so you don't cry so easily at the wrong times. It's also a way of training yourself to have control over your emotions instead of them controlling you. \n\nIf you like watching things that make you cry, check out this website I made that features a rotation of the most tear-inducing videos known to science: [www.cryonceaweek.com](https://www.cryonceaweek.com).\n\nI also wrote a free ebook about the benefits of crying that you can get on there.",

Have all the emotions you want! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what is your crying like when this happens. Do you tear up? Do you outright bawl? For what it's worth, breath is the key to all emotions. If you every feel the crying begin when you don't want to express sadness, try to just focus on regulating your breath to see if that helps. That, and keep your eyes up, try not to let them drop down.",

            "comment": "Crying is very good for your mental and physical health and helps release pent up feelings. If you cry intentionally in the right way, it can provide an emotional release so you don't cry so easily at the wrong times. It's also a way of training yourself to have control over your emotions instead of them controlling you. \n\nIf you like watching things that make you cry, check out this website I made that features a rotation of the most tear-inducing videos known to science: [www.cryonceaweek.com](https://www.cryonceaweek.com).\n\nI also wrote a free ebook about the benefits of crying that you can get on there.",

Have all the emotions you want! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what is your crying like when this happens. Do you tear up? Do you outright bawl? For what it's worth, breath is the key to all emotions. If you every feel the crying begin when you don't want to express sadness, try to just focus on regulating your breath to see if that helps. That, and keep your eyes up, try not to let them drop down.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve worked in a state DD facility for 2 yrs. March we had our first positive covid case. It\u2019s been a war zone for 3 months, and I know everyone is stressed out. But, thought the covid, I came to realize how mean some of my coworkers were to my patients, during a time where they are in pain, uncomfortable, and can\u2019t see they\u2019re loved ones for months. They don\u2019t understand as well as we do the circumstances surrounding covid-19.\nMy building is a mixture of Behavioral patients with some medical needs, and some mainly medical patients with minor behavioral needs. They are all living breathing souls, and should be treated family, especially during a time of hardship such as covid isolation. One of my co-unit leaders was irresponsible when it came to grooming and bathing the positive individuals and blatantly and ignorantly bathed covid negative people after the positives. Not to mention she doesn\u2019t change gloves etc. \nMy girlfriend whom I met at work and worked the same shift and pattern with, had a nervous breakdown because of our coworker berating and belittling her.\nMy GF shared a photo of our kids sidewalk chalk saying \u201c Murray strong\u201d, supporting us. The coworker sent my GF a PM belittling her and saying how unimportant our kids are. I\u2019m at a loss what to do think feel or do. I love my job and my patients like family.\nToday I learned that this coworker reported that I made a threat to her. I have no clue what the threat even is?! But there is supposedly a screenshot... I\u2019m losing my mind",

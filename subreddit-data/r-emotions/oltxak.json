    "postText": " \n\nSinking\n\n* S\n\nThe everlasting feeling of \u201cSinking\u201d? Now I know what some of you are thinking- what do you mean sinking? Usually people will say drowning, or simpler words like just stress or overwhelmed, while those might be true I feel like sinking is a great way to describe it. \n\nSee, sinking is never hopeless, for you can always swim with effort and will. But, however metaphoric sinking is much harder to swim out of- especially if you are unaware that you\u2019re sinking. \n\nEveryone sinks at a different pace, some faster than others, some realize they can barely breath before it\u2019s too late . I\u2019m sorry if you never realized you were sinking and eventually met the dreadful bottom. I know it\u2019s dark, and quiet down there. So much pressure pushing you more and more towards the bottom you\u2019ve already reached- why continue trying to swim? Did you even try to swim at the start? Did you realize too late that you were sinking? \n\nIf this happens I'm sorry. No one deserves to sink to the bottom. We\u2019re all sinking to an extent, we all fight our demons, no matter what someone says we all have demons. We\u2019re all afraid to face them, isn\u2019t it scary the only way to escape the depths of your mind is to face what scares, and pressures you the most. \n\nI\u2019ve sunk a lot in my life, I'm sure I was even close to the bottom a couple times. You sink a lot faster than others when you have issues with anxiety, or trust issues. I still have those bricks attached to my feet to this day. But although they still pull me under, I've found my help. The word I think suits this \u201chelp\u201d the best would be a life jacket? We all sink, but sinking isn\u2019t always alone. You can be someone's life jacket or have someone be that for you if you\u2019ve already sunk so deep you can\u2019t see the surface anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know if God exists or in our scenario \u201cposeidon\u201d but if he does, I think he attached those to our feet on purpose. I say \u201cour\u201d because my metaphoric life jacket was below me in the darkest depths, I was lucky enough to be there as she was there for me. We might not even see the sun yet, we might not see it for a while. But no matter what, my life jacket is enough to keep me away from the darkness, enough to see the light at least a little. Enough to smile even though I'm under the water. Opportunities come so often and people mistakenly let them go and never think about it twice. But PLEASE take that chance. For you might just meet the person who helps you see the surface once again.\n\n* To the person who helps me swim up to the surface. You are the love of my life, thank you for being my Wife",

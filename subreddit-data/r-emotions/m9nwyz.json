You are just there, you have no purpose, no sense, you just know, and you hate it, it makes you feel like you're suffocating, your chest tightens and your eyes fill with water, your body hurts, you don't want to want, you don't even know how to explain it you just know it's there and you don't know why, it could be the trauma, it could be the love lost, but you know that it's there, no one else knows how you feel and it's never ending.",

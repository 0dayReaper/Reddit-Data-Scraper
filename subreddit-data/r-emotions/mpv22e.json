    "postText": "I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with me. I have emotions, I know I do, but when it comes to relationships I feel nothing but sadness and sexual tendencies that I don\u2019t want to fulfill. I got out of my relationship and I feel nothing. I feel less sad but still I know most girls would be crying. I know I hurt him bad and I feel bad for it, I really do, but I know it would\u2019ve hurt him more if I stayed knowing I can\u2019t feel the happiness or love. I feel like I\u2019m broken and I don\u2019t know if I want anyone to fix me. Maybe I just have commitment issues?",

            "comment": "So in a relationship you feel sad and don\u2019t want sexual contact. I see you also enjoy the comfort of sucking your thumb and have your baby blanket and stuffed animals at 19. That\u2019s ok. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re still quite infantilised and unhappy to move into adulthood and adult relationships. Give yourself time. If you want an affectionate but non sexual relationship you have to be clear about that from the beginning. The thumb sucking will affect your teeth so if you want to stop you can try the bad tasting soapy nail polish.",

            "comment": "Sounds like self-handicapping to me. Sometimes when we care a lot about something we'll sabotage it because if you expect it to fail at least you can be the one in control of the failure right?\n\nIn high school if I had a big test and expected to do poorly instead of preparing as best I could to at least get a decent grade I would put obstacles in my way to success. I wouldn't study, I'd play video games and I'd stay up late the night before. I'd create excuses for why I didn't succeed because being lazy is easier than accepting I'm just not good enough.\n\nMaybe you expect your relationships to fail so you detach yourself from them emotionally and become distant. You fail the relationship before it has a chance to fail you because if you do your best and it still doesn't work that hurts more. It's a deep pain because in someway it may reflect something you believe. That you aren't worthy enough to be loved, that you aren't mature enough, a good enough person, attractive enough, charming enough, etc.\n\nIn someway you probably expect failure and already have one foot out the door.",

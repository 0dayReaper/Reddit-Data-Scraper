    "postText": "Im scared to express myself. I've grown up my entire life being told my true personality is annoying and now that I've finally lost it I am being told that I'm even more annoying because my personality and traits are based off of others'.  \n\nSo now I am trying to avoid picking up people's traits and personality but I just feel hollow? Like, my true self at this point is this teenage girl who lacks emotion, is anxious and depressed, doesn't give two fucks about almost anything (except my dog, he's my heart)  and can't make a decision for herself because it might upset someone.\n\nAnd I'm trying to change, to be me, but I try expressing myself and I feel like I'm too forward about it. Im too loud, too obnoxious, too excited, annoying, repetitive, stupid. And I can see adults expressions change to one of annoyance or distaste when I slip up and become too expressive. \n\n\nI know I need to change but I don't know how and I just feel so lost.",

That\u2019s the beauty of dogs, as long as you\u2019re kind they accept you without question. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what will change for you unless the adults in your life change their attitude. The best case scenario is that you will grow up to feel most comfortable with animals and follow that into a career in dog training or veterinary care or dog handling, etc. Once you\u2019re older and leave home you may well rediscover your own voice and find that you were a perfectly likeable person all along. \n\nUnderstanding of family dynamics and psychology is something many people only come to later in life after years of confusion. You can strengthen yourself and increase your resilience by studying it now. There are lots of resources online.\n\nUnhappiness in early years often leads people to try to escape through trying drugs of various kinds. This is understandable but ultimately very unhelpful. It only adds another layer of problems, without either solving the first layer or allowing you to find your own strength and resilience. I hope you don\u2019t feel that temptation. Life will get better. It may be that your childhood and teenage years are something you will always look back on with sadness, or anger, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a happy life in the future. \nPosting on Reddit isn\u2019t going to give you the kind of support you need, but there is proper free online counselling available. I suggest you look into that, having someone to talk to who\u2019s on your side and has professional skills will make a huge difference, I\u2019m sure.",

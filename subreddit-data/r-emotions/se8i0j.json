I just think it's a cool idea what he's doing and I know many people might benefit from it so that's why I'm sharing it). \n\n\nIt will be a 90-min live guided meditation to help you cleanse your soul from all the anger, sadness, guilt, shame, fear, and every clogged unhealthy emotion that you\u2019ve accumulated and are still subconsciously holding on to. \n\nWe'll use Kundalini Yoga, Tantra &amp; Breathwork techniques to detox your heart from negative emotional blockage. \n\n[Learn more here ](https://www.wakeup.mateojl.com/medit-emotional-detox)",

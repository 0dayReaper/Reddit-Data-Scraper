    "postText": "Hi I don't really understand myself my mind is really uncontrollable and it's hard for me not to control my emotions but just to have them back and forth and back and forth I wake up mad and with an attitude sometimes and I just get so frustrated for no little reason then I get sad all of the sudden or just happy but not naturally  happy like a fake happy but at the same time joyous. I dont know why I am like this and I want to have control over my emotions. I have been thru heart break and I have learned from it and it helped me really understand we dont need things in life to be happy but at the same time I just want to not die but just be so isolated but at the same time be with people and interact but I can be so mean. Like ill cuss someone out for no reason and just feel bad right after. or I will just offend someone on the spot just because I dont like how they look. I have this mentality where people and ourselves shouldn't care about how people see us because we are our selves and no one can judge us but god and ourselves but I also realize people cant handle what I say even tho its in a horrible fashion I dont actually intend or mean anything I say. I want help how do I do something to help me I dont want to do anything professional because it just makes things worse and I just need advice",

    "postText": "If I don't talk about my emotions, how can I let out my emotions (instead of unintentionally bottling it up inside). I really do want to talk about my feelings but it's so hard to put it into words. It is especially hard now since I can't think (at least not very well anymore.) Other cognitive skills are also getting worse but that's not what i'm asking for help for",

Are you able to share more about what you\u2019re experiencing and why it\u2019s gotten to this stage? If that\u2019s too personal it\u2019s no problem. Only share what you\u2019re comfortable with.",

Then I'll try to relive experiences as each individual but with the situation reversed. You can keep going down that rabbit hole.\n\nTry to consider power dynamics and how they shift over time. Really break down societal patterns and see bigger pictures. Remember to have an open mind and play devil's advocate with yourself. \n\nFeel free to express fear, anger, shame, jealousy.... All of it with yourself. Let yourself be honest with yourself. When you accept yourself, and trust your patterns. When you've figured yourself out. You're empowered.\n\nYou know how you'll react to situations. And be prepared to mindfully engage without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nPerspective exercises are important.\n\nWriting them down helps you stay focused.",

Dogs do this. After a stressful event, a dog shakes his body. That helps him release the stressor from his body rather than store it.\n\nYou can do releasing rituals.",

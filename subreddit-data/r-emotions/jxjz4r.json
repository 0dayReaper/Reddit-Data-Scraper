    "postText": "I've never felt like this until today, usually I don't feel so guilty or depressed when I spend money. The thing is, I'm usually relatively broke compared to others my age who help the neighbors. I've never touched a 50 dollar bill or even a 100 dollar bill. I'm starting to think I'm letting greed get the best of me..",

Always do your own research as well, with all topics, but most importantly finances)",

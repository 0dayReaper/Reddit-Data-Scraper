    "postText": "In short I went to job Interview for the first time in years after horrible bad interviews I\u2019ve had in the past of my sadly self hating depressive life. \n\nBut after today, I feel like a small part of that pain I carry around from years of emotional and psychological torment from my childhood from my less than sympathetic parents, finally evaporated. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t know what this cluster of emotions I\u2019m feeling is but I\u2019m crying with a shaky smile on my face.\n\nI feel some kind of happy mood, some kind of positivity, but even with the positive feelings bombarding me I still mentally know \u201cI\u2019m not okay\u201d it\u2019s like the depression is still there but is being temporarily blocked out by my high positivity from my hope of moving forward with my life finally, especially after a semicolon (;) became a symbol for me. \n\nLately I\u2019m starting to realize my emotions are valid despite what my parents tell me. Im still not sure which emotions are what, but I\u2019m fighting for my life and I\u2019m fighting to keep that semblance or maybe small hope alive and growing.\n\nIf you read this thank you! Im glad you stayed to read. \n\nHere\u2019s my question: is it possible to feel happy/hopeful and not okay at the same time?",

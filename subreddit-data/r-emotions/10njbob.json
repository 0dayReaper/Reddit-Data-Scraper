    "postText": "I did not realize that self neglect was this bad. \n\nLately, I've realized that I haven't been portraying myself well. Problems are hard sometimes that I just really go straight into self neglect to a depressive phase. Then, people started reacting to it. They felt that my say didn't matter much unlike before. But it was really because I wasn't even taking myself seriously. It got to the point where physically, it showed. And now, I'll be starting to get back who i am. But it's been years of self neglect that i have to fix. \n\nFor the people who are troubled with problems, low self esteem, etc. I feel you. But I just want to remind you that situations are already unfair, don't make it more unfair by neglecting yourself - your joy, your physical body, your hobbies, etc. In unfair situations where you have no choice but to keep going, the more you have to take care of yourself. When no one's there, you have to take care of yourself. Show the world what you deserve.",

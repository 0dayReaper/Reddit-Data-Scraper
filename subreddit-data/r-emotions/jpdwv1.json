What really matters is what we do with them. \n\nIf you feel jealous about anything, it's important to sit with yourself and figure out why exactly you are feeling this way, and then from there decide what needs to be done. This can come in the form of talking to somebody, acceptance, or any other number of possible solutions.\n\nThe worst thing you can do though is ignore your feelings and try to push them down. That will only make things worse  especially in the long run",

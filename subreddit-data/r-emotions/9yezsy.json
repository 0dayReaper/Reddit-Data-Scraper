    "postText": "So this is a new thing to me. Not depression. But that there is a community that you can go to online or anywhere really that will at least attempt to listen. For years, I've experienced on-and-off depression. I am 20 years old. This depression has come in spurts throughout my life. It came very hard when I was 10 years old, 13 years old, and 16-18 years old. I would say I haven't felt any severe depression since about mid-2017. I am not saying I am feeling it now, but for some reason, the past few days I am getting the beginning feelings I have always felt when something like this has come on. I get distant, and my body just feels a disassociation with life if that makes sense. Last night, I was sitting at a table with my friends and my girlfriend, And I physically felt like a ghost. Not because they weren't talking to me, because they were. I feel like an actor most of my life, and that I act feelings sometimes or just don't always feel fully associated in life. Not that I can't feel emotion or empathy cuz I definitely can, its just like these feelings bring upon me a feeling of being a ghost, as best as I can describe it. I don't want to fall into a depression and I'm really trying something I've never tried before...I've never had the ability to really vent about any and everything I've ever been through. I feel I have been shut up. When I went thru things, my family never got me the right help, especially for the severity of what I was going thru (I have cut multiple times, and have attempted suicide at least twice or three times, including once where I almost swallowed about 30/40 pills). So, here I go...here's me...if you don't wanna hear...it's cool...but here's my story:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was born to a father and mother who were not together. They split up only 9 months after I was born. They weren't necessarily hateful of each other, but I also only saw my dad once every other week from the time I was 2-9. I mostly lived with my mother. The first trauma I can honestly remember having that affected me, was I lived with my mother and her abusive boyfriend when I was about 3-5 and I remember multiple times where they would have sex and I would be left in the bed to sleep right next to them as they had sex, completely naked. I have vivid visual memories of seeing this man have sex with my mother, even climax, completely naked, as young as 3. I think throughout my life this has given a skewed view of sex, or at least, an overexposed view of sex. I can remember have fantasies about sex when I was as young as 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was about 8, my mother married another man and they had a kid together. My younger brother. The man she was married to was a bit of a jerk. He would constantly blame and yell at me over things that were not my fault, even the littlest of shit. I remember on my birthday one year, I walked in thru the door and he said \"go feed the dog\". And like I said before, my mom died when I was 10, quite suddenly, from a spontaneous brain aneurysm, and my whole life changed quite overnight. I moved two hours away to live with my dad overnight. to a new school I had never been to. 95% of the family I had when I lived with my mom, never once came up to see me, never once drove two hours up to see me. For no real reason. I lost contact with pretty much everybody in my life, outside of my dad and an uncle of mine and one or two aunts. My ex-stepfather, who was in charge of all the funeral arrangements for my mother, had her headstone made up with ONLY pictures of him &amp; her on there, not one of me or my younger brother. So her whole headstone is just pictures of them imprinted on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time I remember thinking of suicide is when I was 10. I wouldn't eat. I would often think about taking my own life. I felt very empty. My dad, although I love him, was an irresponsible father in many ways. The house we lived in lacked proper lighting, cleaning, &amp; he didn't have a job for about 6 years, simply due to his laziness. He was also abusive at times in my life. I remember times when I was 10, him getting mad at me and running at me violently, grabbing my hair and head, throwing me around. I remember one time he was tickling me and I accidentally hit him due to flailing, and he got mad, and hit me multiple times, then made me apologize for accidentally hitting him. He would call me \"bitch\", \"faggot\", \"I hate you\", etc. And I'm not saying this was EVERY DAY, but my dad has always been someone you have to handle with extreme care. Not so much now. But when I was 10-17. I also remember a time where we got into a physical fight and I was thrown into a fridge door. Nonetheless, I love my father and he is a much better man now, but I grew up in a violent household. My father also never really let me out of the house or to possess certain normal teenage things for years. I was on a strict lifestyle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was about 12-13, I began to have intense and quite strange tendencies. I developed the idea that if I didn't wash my hands up to 50+ times a day, I would accidentally kill somebody due to germs. I would also develop illusions, and I began to somehow believe I was responsible for my mom's death, even though I was nowhere near her during her death. I also began to believe that I was responsible for deaths around me somehow or just people in general in the world. I genuinely believed if I didn't wash my hands or repeat prayers to myself CONSTANTLY (up to 1,000 times a day) that these people would die. I began to see things, and one night I saw the worlds \"kill yourself\" written on the wall, very briefly, and it lead to me to attempt suicide that night and the next night. My dad found out, but he never put me in mental hospital or a real physiatrist, just a counselor, who really didn't have the rank to diagnose me properly. I only experienced these illusions for a few months and then they stopped. But they really mentally scarred me and I never got help for them, at least proper help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the time I was 14-16 my life took a turn up. I started doing well in high school and found a passion in theatre. Where I excelled. Around 17, a lot of my life basically was thrown up in the air. My house of my whole life got taken away from foreclosure. My girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up quite suddenly. I was FINALLY diagnosed with clinical depression and tried 3 different anti-depressants before finding one that helped me. I lost everything I owned from the foreclosure, other than a few pair of clothes and a computer. I moved into a small $500/month apartment where I have lived with my father since. I was also in a professional theatre program for kids at this point where I got the opportunity to be a part of pro theatre as a 16 year old, but this also put a huge financial strain on my father, who was already suffering. And the program was 45 minutes away. This all lead to a pretty much mental breakdown, during which time suicide was a very real thing in my life. I never felt worse in my life than this year long period or so. I also found a girlfriend, who I genuinely liked and connected to very deeply, but ended up breaking up with cuz I felt as if I was not fit enough mentally to have a girlfriend. We remained friends. And later, we got together. We have been together since last June and it has 100% been the happiest time in my life. I genuinely love her and she genuinely loves me. But, for some reason, these past few days and in small spurts, I have been feeling a small disassociation from her and the life I have in general I guess. She is the best thing to ever happen to me and I will always love her forever and be with her forever I think. But, Idk, sometimes it is hard to tell her my feelings, or let out certain parts of me, because she has some type of resentment to it, or her own problems that get in the way.\n\nOne other thing and the final thing I can think of that have affected me, is my grandfather. He is a convicted pedophile, who served years in prison for this crime, and is on Meagan's list. When I was younger, like 6-9 (I didn't know better) when I would spend the night at his house, we would often sleep together in the same bed, in just underwear and nothing else. He would always ask me to cuddle and would hold me close and rub my back and just be kinda creepy (in hindsight) not that he ever actually did anything 100% sexual, but given who he is, it made me think later in my life of what his intentions might have been or what he was thinking about when this happened. And it happened often, for years. Even up to the time I was 11 or 12. Also, he has been a bit of a bully. A lot of a bully. I learned that he raped my grandma, leading to her problems in life. I also numerous times saw him physically abuse my younger brother throughout the years. And he always forced his way into my life. Just last year, he began to contact me in ways that I didn't approve of...first saying \"hi\", then calling 3 times, then when I wouldn't respond there, he would message on IG, or twitter, or Facebook, then it got creepy...making new FB accounts just to contact me after I blocked him or finding emails of mine that he would have zero possible way of finding unless he put a PI on me or something of the sort. It was just creepy so I have completely cut him out of my life. But he still posts things of me on his Facebook, and finds pictures of mine, etc. I am afraid constantly that I am going to be doing a play or something and he is going to show up in the audience and hurt my reputation or cause a scene. And such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this is my life. At least in some parts. There have been numerous beautiful parts as well. I didn't write these things to create a poor me post. I just needed to vent. And have never gotten that chance I feel. I hope everybody is OK. - AJ",

    "postText": "Don\u2019t know if anyone will even understand what I\u2019m trying to explain but sometimes when I hear or learn certain information (I believe) I get a strong rush of emotion. Not any specific emotion, but nonetheless strong enough to draw tears and give me goosebumps at times.\nFor example, without going into too much detail. My sister told me a story once that she sworn she seen a ghost/spirit or something and when she described what she saw I got that rush of emotion. I find it happens often as well when I listen to some conspiracies theories, they\u2019ll be at least one theory that just about brings me to tears because of the wave of emotion I feel when hearing certain things. I think it is somewhat linked to me believing whatever info I\u2019m hearing whole heartedly but I\u2019m not 100% sure.\nIdk if there is even a word or an explanation for this but if there is I\u2019m interested in finding out more about it.",

I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that because I didn\u2019t think something could resonate with you to the point of tears or brink of but it 100% makes sense now that I\u2019m hearing it. Time to go into the rabbit hole as to why lol. Thank you again!",

It\u2019s like when I hear something that I feel in my body is the truth, as said sometimes to the point of tears. Usually it\u2019s something said on a very specific topic or a very specific theory, it almost feels like my body is telling me \u201cyes, this is the truth/answer\u201d which makes me think it\u2019s more sense than feeling.",

I feel this sometimes when reading something very mysterious, during Christmas, holidays, etc.... Feelings are intrinsic phenomena that do not necessarily represent reality. By \"new\" feelings I mean non-ordinary feelings. Do you know the difference between feeling and emotion? Would you say there's an emotional component as well?",

I wouldn\u2019t say there is ALWAYS a emotional component behind this feeling but in certain scenarios there definitely can be. One time watching a movie that me and my dad used to watch when I was young (he passed years ago), I thought of him and I felt like he spoke to me through the next lines in the movie. I had the same feeling then. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s 100% not linked to emotion but it does bring me to tears sometimes. I really like something you said though, \u201cfeelings are intrinsic phenomena that do not necessarily represent reality\u201d because I feel like that fits perfectly. I know I have these feelings for a reason, I feel it, and that\u2019s why I brings me to tears at times I believe. But because it doesn\u2019t represent the reality I/we know, I can\u2019t fully understand it.. if that makes sense?",

These feelings, which I call High Order Feeling (HOF), lead me to think that there must be a higher purpose in all of this.\n\n In my case they are very much linked to emotions. The sensation I have even affects the limbic system (eg hearth rate, toughts, adrenaline spikes) as well, their duration is more consistent with emotion (minutes) than with feelings.\n\n Therefore, I would say that it is a middle ground between emotions and feelings (in my case). Also, they have valence, like affects. positive valence for pleasant HOFs and negative valence for unpleasant HOFs.  \n\nThat is, they have this dimension, which says a lot about them having partly the nature of ordinary affections and being (sometimes) affectes by them. Also, valency is not always consistent with our ordinary affective state. (On a sad day, feeling a positive HOF when looking at a beautiful landscape). It is therefore a very mysterious phenomenon. It is partly independent of our feelings and perhaps even independent of our emotional state. This makes me think that it may be due to another structure, which does not compete with the Amygdala more primitive affects.  Otherwise, the opposite valences would interfere each other. \n\n I have already tried to understand in mysticism and in religion. No luck... Today I seek to understand rationally, studying human cognition and emotions. If this means something more or not I deeply do not know. But I rationally think that probably not. but care must be taken, because the affects are powerful in displacing us from reality, but they never affect reality itself.  Be careful not to get lost, as i did.\n\nTell me if this all makes sense for you",

The feeling of \u201cthere must be a higher purpose in all of this.\u201d fits perfectly. You talking about it being due to another structure kinda tells me I\u2019ve been on the right track so far. Like you I\u2019ve tried to reasoning behind this through religion research (even though im not THE most religious) but to no avail, which lead me here to you, who seem like the first person that I feel understands exactly what im saying. Partly independent of feeling, and partly independent of emotion.. Yes. It\u2019s almost like you know feelings and emotions are there but can\u2019t put a finger on as to where so to speak. I may be \u201clost\u201d as you put already, if we\u2019re on the same page, but fortunately I am able to keep a firm grip on reality while also keeping an open mind ready to learn. In doing so I feel like it better helps me truly see reality through my own eyes. But In other words, being lost isn\u2019t always a bad thing, in some cases it\u2019s the last step before a discovery. I personally believe it might be do to another structure or something that we don\u2019t understand yet and maybe never will, which I have come to terms with and keeps me grounded. I actually really enjoyed this conversation and am glad to know I\u2019m not the only one who gets that feeling. Thank you! And wish my blessings on you.",

    "postText": "When in deep emotional pain, i feel like a child. Like i want to sleep and i'm about to cry because i need to sleep right now hugging my plushie or like i need to be hugged by someone that makes me feel safe until i fall asleep. I'm really bad at expressing my emmotions and identifying them so i'm sorry if this isn't clear enough but i feel like there's an obvious reason behind this i'm not aware of.",

    "postText": "Just some thoughts I really need someone to just read without judgement.\n\nBesides having the horrific honor of being a Scorpio, November 5th is just another day I try and act like I had no idea what day it is. \nA birth day? Or\u2026a day for other people to remember you. Even if you\u2019re across the world, haven\u2019t spoken to them in years, nor contact with mutual friends, and yet, there they are, thinking about you. \n\nA mother who made sure to say with more than enough witnesses in ear hearing range wishes she followed through with the abortion.\n\nThe father who nearly convinced her to abort, gave you up for adoption, and who could forget, you didn\u2019t even make an appearance in the delivery room.\n\nThe siblings, Knew only an older and younger brother.\nThe older one passed away in a motorcycle accident when I was 13, which ultimately lead to me meeting 3 other brothers and a sister, to be forgotten,blocked on every app or calling log,and undoubtedly disowned by the time I turned 20. Faults from both parties no mistaken.\n\n\nFriends? Not a clue what those truly are, as it was made clear to me that tons of people I would of gave the shirt on my back to if they had nothing, \nthought of me as: Gullible, easily manipulated, &amp; Lastly, a free ride(from literal car rides to free food, roofs over their heads, even was told I got robbed of money right out of my wallet behind my back.\n\n\nTurning 25, can\u2019t remember not even one in the last 8 years, well, can\u2019t remember being happy, content, comfortable, not even safe honestly. Been a little longer than that since I\u2019ve received as much as a birthday card, although I would of settled for a little text, 10 second phone call, not that I asked or will ask for that or anything more. It\u2019s not expected. \n\nIf I remember correctly, turning 24, I had one person wish me happy birthday or even acknowledge it anyway, specifically because they told me Facebook reminded them when they were doing their morning scrolling before our opening shifts. \n\nAlways wondered what it would be like to have one day a year where at the very least was acknowledged, Appreciated, or even just the slightest bit of being emotional or mentally cared about because that person wants to and means it. \nOr even a small group of distant/close friends or family that spend at minimum an hour with you, maybe all bought a small gift each no matter how big or small, or cheap or expensive it was. Wouldn\u2019t have to even be materialistic to me. \n\nBut this year is no different than the ones before, no changed expectations.\nI just wanted to finally say what\u2019s been eating me alive for the last decade in my heart and mind to anyone that would read this or hear me vent it.",

            "comment": "Belated Happy Birthday. Sorry you\u2019re feeling sad. Hope that can change for you. \nThere\u2019s a lot of different therapy styles and methods to clear out past hurts and unhappiness, you\u2019ve probably looked at some already. But here\u2019s a way of looking at it that you may not have explored yet. I offer you this as a result of my own experience and study.  \nFeelings are your problem here, what happened in the past is long gone but your feelings are present each day. And feelings are literally physical sensations in your abdomen. They\u2019re not \u2018psychic, spiritual\u2019 vague things, they\u2019re real, physical sensations. And they\u2019re made by the solar plexus, the \u2018gut brain.\u2019 This is a complex bundle of neurons and synapses and nerve fibres which is literally an ancient, primitive brain, and it exists in our bodies for the specific purpose of creating our feelings and emotions. Everything we do, every decision and choice we make is controlled by our feelings. Muscle fibres around our stomach, intestines and other organs are stimulated to twitch or contract and these sensations signal basically either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Our experiences trigger the solar plexus to create our feelings and our experiences, and repeated bad feelings can create a \u2018muscle memory\u2019 which becomes our \u2018standard setting\u2019. So unhappiness becomes the normal feeling.   \nRemembering past unhappy experiences and thinking unhappy thoughts sends a signal down to the solar plexus that something is wrong, so the solar plexus triggers the bad feelings, in an effort to make us move away from the bad situation. It doesn\u2019t know the difference between something that is happening right now, and something that happened a long time ago, that we are remembering.  \nMost therapies concentrate on changing the way we think in order to change the way we feel.\n\nThis can be very effective, but it can also take a long time.So I would like to tell you about a different way of changing the way you feel. Since these feelings that we all have are literally physical, muscular contractions and tensions, which get stuck after many repetitions, it is possible to treat them as a physical problem, like repetitive strain injury. Abdominal massage, specifically the Barral technique of visceral manipulation, physically de stresses those internal muscles and releases the sensation of anxiety and sadness at the same time. It\u2019s an old Chinese method, discovered and promoted by a French osteopath in the 1980\u2019s.   \nI can\u2019t change how your family treated you in the past or today, and nor can you, but the real problem is how that makes you _feel_ and maybe, if you can find an osteopath or trained masseur for a short session of abdominal massage you can change that and feel ok.  \n\nAll the best.",

Unfortunatly being told to \"breath deeply\" is a very big trigger for me, and make reflow a lot of bad memory and tears.   \n\n\nI'm working on it with a shrimp , but it's not something light and easy to fix.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other technique to calm down? To regulate anger and sadness?",

            "comment": "You could try clenching every muscle in your body that you can find at once and then completely releasing them. I'm surprised at how well this can work for me to regulate distressing emotions.\n\nI've also heard of people kinda shivering and shaking to get that crap out of their body.\n\nDancing can be an incredible release, with the added benefit of endorphins.\n\nThat crap gets stuck in your body, and movement in general seems really effective at getting it unstuck.\n\nProlly sounds kinda woo. And I dunno, maybe it is. But I was surprised at how effective it is, so I dunno, give it a shot.",

            "comment": "Sometimes you gotta be sad when you're sad, same for anger. But, you can change the volume on those feelings by working on them in a planned way. \n\nYou can express those feeling when you're alone or with a trusted friend/partner. If deep breathing can get you into the emotional state, you can use that to do it intentionally when you have time to process it all and actually express the feelings. \n\nThe more you do that, the more blunt the feelings will be when they hit you 'out in the world'  - they get so urgent and untameable because you're ignoring them. When you stop ignoring them, they become more manageable, eventually they go away entirely. Not all feelings, but specific triggers. \n\n The therapist should be able to give you space and support to express them too. I know from experience, it's a huge weight off.",

            "comment": "In my research I\u2019ve looked at the purely physical sensations of emotions/feelings and how they\u2019re caused by the solar plexus (gut brain) stimulating specific places in the smooth muscle around our internal organs. I won\u2019t suggest deep breathing but I believe that deep, abdominal breathing can have a relaxing effect by putting pressure on those internal organs, effectively \u2018massaging\u2019 them. I believe it may also be why some people over eat as a way of coping with anxiety, the pressure of the food in their stomach pressing on their organs temporarily soothes them.  \nIn the 1980\u2019s a French Osteopath, Jean-Pierre Barral, developed a technique of abdominal massage or \u2018visceral manipulation\u2019, derived from much older Chinese practise, for among other things, the release of stress and anxiety. Many osteopaths learn these techniques and the process is quite simple. The idea is that massaging the internal organs in the abdomen relaxes and soothes those smooth muscles that tense up and create sensations we call anxiety and stress and is an efficient way to release it.   \nI personally know people who have had the short massages done, who then feel euphoric and \u2018lighter than air\u2019 with the emotional release they experience.   \nI also suspect that strong, repeated  emotions experienced especially in childhood, can set up a \u2018muscle memory\u2019 in those \u2018emotional muscles\u2019 which becomes a long standing habit. Repeated sessions may be necessary to reverse that muscle memory or habituated pattern of stress.\nThere are self massage techniques for the same purpose, but my suggestion would be to find an osteopath trained in the Barral technique and who has specific experience of using it for anxiety and see if it works for you. \n\nhttps://www.barralinstitute.com/therapies/\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/science/complex-and-hidden-brain-in-gut-makes-stomachaches-and-butterflies.html\n\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-second-brain/\n\n\nhttps://advancedorthopt.com/what-is-visceral-manipulation/",

            "comment": "ALBA METHOD!!  \n\n\n\"deep\" isn't a quality of breath. Alba breaks breath into, diaphragmatic or clavicular placement, length of inhale vs exhale, different nose/mouth combinations and safely explores which combinations helps you \"relax\". Alba also helps regulate emotions though manipulating body tension and facial expressions in conjunction with different breathing patterns.   \n\n\nBut you're absolutely right - it's not something light and easy to fix. Building emotional resilience is like building any skill, it takes time and practice and won't come with just a realization from someone mentioning the right answer. And there are a LOT of people offering easy answers on the topic of Emotional Awareness on the internet. But it's also not a deep mystery, it just takes a little time commitment and it really, really helps to begin by learning under a coach. I highly recommend alba method, or alba emoting. Same technique, different names depending on which country you're in.",

Lately I've felt very lonely me and my freinds dint interact the same way and making new ones is hard. And everything feels so cluttered and idk if uts the fact that I'm in school now or that my sleep scheduled is fucked or maybe even the fact I watched a sad movie 10 min ago but I've felt like crying but I can't and idk if I'm being overdramatic biut this but I just really wanna know whats up up me .",

Because you have a hard time making new ones, you might feel anxiety about keeping your current ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis may be a trivial matter to you, but this is what being human means. To feel these kinds of things and make ends with them. Accept them if you want to end it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may not know what's going on your side, and I'm not obliged to say those useless words of reassurance, but I can at least tell you this, even if it might be useless itself.",

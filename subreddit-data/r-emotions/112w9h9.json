Then, you get tired. But sometimes, it's easy to catch yourself and get rid of it. \n\n\nWhen you get the big anxiety, even if u try to tell ur brain to shut it, it's just really there and you think again about all the scenarios THEN your brain gives you another topic then you make a set of scenarios THEN your brain gives you another topic again and the cycle begins again.",

Just a moment to catch your breath but nothing will listen to you and you have no control and you can\u2019t breath and you just need a second but it\u2019s all too much and your drowning now but you know that if you could just get a small breath of air you\u2019d be ok but it\u2019s not working and you can\u2019t figure out why it\u2019s not working but you know it\u2019s not working so you sit there and suffocate in everything being too much.",

On the other hand, this obviously bothers you, so it might be worth discussing with someone - if nothing else - your feelings about that. You may end up learning to be more comfortable with your affect range, or you may unearth something else going on. You may be depressed, but no one can tell you that but yourself and a trained psychiatrist - and tbh it's still really up to you to decide",

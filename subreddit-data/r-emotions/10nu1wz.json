    "postText": "So I have emotions but they are hardly there, like if I'm mad I don't even portray it to other people. I have for a couple of years now enhanced my good emotions like happiness and kept my other bad emotions such as sadness or angriness the same. So all anyone ever sees of me is happiness and I don't seem to have any other emotion to them. I act like a rock to some family and my girlfriend and sometimes it becomes annoying having to deal with their emotions but I love to help them. I also have trouble conceiving that other people have emotions too so I feel like my view on things should be everyone's view on things. I don't really make comments or portray that though. I also hate doing stuff I consider  a waste of time or learning things I will never use. I also get annoyed if I'm in class and we go a slower pace then I am learning at because of certain students such as doing a single lesson for weeks that I learnt on the first day. I was wondering if maybe I should get some of these things checked out.\n\nTLDR: I don't have vivid emotions and I have to enhance them to feel normal.",

On the other hand, this obviously bothers you, so it might be worth discussing with someone - if nothing else - your feelings about that. You may end up learning to be more comfortable with your affect range, or you may unearth something else going on. You may be depressed, but no one can tell you that but yourself and a trained psychiatrist - and tbh it's still really up to you to decide",

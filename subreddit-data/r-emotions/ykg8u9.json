            "comment": "You want to be more like a Stoic.\n\nStoics understand why they feel the way they do and know how to handle their thoughts and emotions.\n\nThey do feel, but they have certain mindsets so they won't be overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions or keep putting oil on the fire of emotions.\n\nFor example they think it's stupid to be angry. We get angry when our expectations are far from reality. So the Stoics say: lower expectations or expect that nobody, not even yourself can fulfill your expectations. You may get annoyed or a bit sad, but angry.. no that's stupid to do.\n\nLot's of philosophers have thought about mindsets, emotions and having a better well-being. \n\nYou can't decrease emotions, you'll always get emotions because it's a function of your body and mind. You can change the way you think and handle emotions (take the right action). You can even change the intensity of the emotions as response to a thought (not only from anger to being annoyed but also major fear to just a bit scared).\n\nSo best to master your emotions more is to learn more about the link between your thoughts and emotions and experiment more with different mindsets.\n\nI feel mostly neutral at the moment. I don't get high peaks of emotions. I'm actually trying to experience all the positive emotions. Now that I control the negative side I want to learn how to control the positive side.",

We need love to not feel lonely, we need fulfillment to not feel empty, we need enough rest to not feel tired or stressed. \n\nFeelings and emotions are just signs the body and mind gives us to warn us of the status we're in. We can't control the lights to go on an off on the dashboard of a car. We fill up the gas when the gas light turns orange (that's the same as a emotion of need). Or we can change our driving behaviour when the warning light comes up when there's a change of freezing of the roads (that's the same as an emotion created by thoughts, expectations).\n\nWe can ignore the warning about the freezing if you're certain the road is not slippery, you can't ignore that there's no more fuel.... when a certain boundary is crossed the car won't start anymore.\n\nYou'll always need your warning system, you'll always need you're feelings and emotions to tell you what your current status is, so you can take the right action (to fuel up or to drive more carfully). We need emotions to tell us we need to eat or find a safe place, we need them to warn us about situations and our behaviour in that situation.\n\nUnderstand your signals and tend to the origin of the signals, don't just ignore them. If you do the right thing they will sign-off.",

Needs need to be fulfilled otherwise your body and mind start to malfunction and it dies.\n\nYou can't decide you don't need food or that you don't need love or the satisfaction of finishing a project. You're a human being. And human beings like all beings on this earth have needs so it can survive and function properly on this planet. (Plant needs sunlight, fish needs water, etc)\n\nYou can always trust your authentic feelings of need, but you can never 100% trust your own thoughts and expectations. And don't mix up a need and an addiction, an addiction is not beneficial to your wellbeing, though your body signals it needs something.\n\nSo name a need what you think is not beneficial to your wellbeing? And what part of you do you trust more then your own needs to decide a need is irrelevant?",

A lot of Buddhism is about letting go all the stuff you cling to or desire. Physically as well as mentally and emotionally. So it will give you rest as you don't need to fullfill desires that aren't there anymore.\n\nI hope this is what you're looking for.",

You'll develop concentration, awareness, endurance, patience and other capabilities.\n\nNext to developing skills you take the time to analyse yourself: Where do these desires come from? Are these mine or family/cultural/social desires?  Are these desires needs (for survival) or wishes (for comfort, status)? \n\nWhat are the priorities in your life? Who do you want to be in 2 years, 5 years or 10 years? What strategies and skills do you have to learn to be able to fulfill that vision?\n\nWhat I said, Buddhism is about understanding what your feelings and emotions tell you, understanding the origin of these feelings and emotions and cease these feelings and emotions by changing your mindset (values, beliefs, expectations, positive/negative thinging, way you precieve yourself and your surroundings, etc) and your behaviour/actions.\n\nFor a start you can listen to these podcasts:\n\n- [The Four Noble Truths](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1plbmNhc3Q/episode/MTFhODBjZWIwZjNkZTZkOTBmNTNkY2ExN2NhNzlhYTA?ep=14) \n- [The Eightfold Path](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1plbmNhc3Q/episode/ZjIwZTIzNDkwZmQzMTlmM2YzMDdkNzllMTY1ZTVkOWI?ep=14)\n\nThe guy is very good it giving examples (and he has some humor). If you want a lot of insights just listen to all of his podcasts on Zencast.\n\nSit, relax and listen to them.",

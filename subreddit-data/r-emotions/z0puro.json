    "postText": "I hate a lot of things about myself, but there is one thing I've wanted to change for years, and that's my emotional-ness. \n\nI've always been \"sensitive\" or \"soft\" and I fucking hate it. I want to be able to feel sad without it showing, I want to be able to not cry in front of people. On the flip side, I want to stop being so fucking annoying when I'm happy. \n\nI'll get overly angry at people for being annoying, but I also get super anxious, whether its about doing something or saying something or asking for something. I had to lie to someone that I had to go, simply because I was too scared of saying that I needed a break from talking. \n\nI want to be able to control my emotions, shove them down, I don't care. I don't care how I do it or what the consequences may be, I just want them to leave me alone. \n\nI know repressing emotions is supposed to be bad for you but like I really don't care at this point. It can't get any worse. These emotions make me hurt myself. They make me cry when I see myself in the mirror. So how do I make them go away?\n\nTl;dr How the fuck to I just stop feeling, because it's hurting me and I need it to stop",

A cumulative thing.    \nIt could be the extra pressure of high school work.   \nIt\u2019s our solar plexus and internal organs that literally create our feelings/emotions by triggering muscular tensions around them.  \nFor example, we typically feel excitement and anxiety at the mid point of the liver, just below the middle of the rib cage  in _almost_ the exact same place.  (Often described and \u2018the pit of the stomach\u2019).  \nAbdominal massage can relax those muscles and soothe them, keeping us in a more even emotional state.  \nHere\u2019s an explanation:\n\nhttps://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/balance/happiness-toolkit-simple-belly-massage/",

            "comment": "Hey :) that sounds difficult and overwhelming. I have been through a similar things. These are the thoughts I have found helpful.\n - Research emotional regulation. This helps you think about how to cause your emotions do what is healthy for you.\n- Understand what causes your emotions. It could be you are neurodivergent (cool if you are! The best people are.) This could be ADHD, autism, etc. Each of these involve a person who is more sensitive and their environments don\u2019t fit them well. Also - writing down your thoughts as you investigate your emotions helps. It builds your skill in expressing the causes of your emotions (this is a secret of therapy \u201cif you can say it you are halfway to changing it.\u201d\n- Be cautious labeling a part of yourself as bad. This can be part of the healing process and also motivational but has some issues. Rejecting yourself doesn\u2019t change who you are, it just hides it. This can make it difficult to know what is happening in your brain.\n- Build a rigorous routine that includes the small stuff. This can give you control over small factors without needing constant anxiety (I use flash cards when learning mine.) As you learn the things to avoid (triggers) and things you need (cause happiness or soothe) add them to your routine. The flash cards simplifies the habit making process \n- Watch Nannette by Hannah Gadsbey and Taylor Tomlinson\u2019s shows. I found these to be quite insightful in how to express emotions and share their journeys in managing emotions. These are technically comedy but are more focused on showing life and how people can live it.\n-I noticed in your other replies that you think school/home are not that bad. I am sure you are correct in this. One thing to remember is that \u201cit being better than elsewhere\u201d or \u201cothers seem happy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it fits you well. A useful phrase to imagine this is \u201ca fish doesn\u2019t know it breathe water\u201d (this means - some big things can be invisible because our brains filter them out.)\n-Repressing your emotions can be harmful but can also be part of healing/growing. It\u2019s similar to a car that doesn\u2019t run quite right. You don\u2019t know what the cause of the problem is so you begin turning off different parts until you have isolated and improved. The intent of this is to turn the car back on :) not attempt to drive it with most of it disabled.\n- Therapy is a good thing and it is worth the effort to set up. The value is have someone independent who will listen to you and give you useful observations so you can more quickly learn (this is also a useful definition of \u201cfriendship.\u201d) Therapy is often more reliably than sharing with a friend because their feedback will be influenced by other things (what is going in their life, what they know and don\u2019t know.) People giving you feedback is similar to a lighthouse which guides a ship to safety. If it\u2019s not reliable the ship will go in circles a long time.\n- I liked your other reply where you analyzed the ethics of someone\u2019s reply. I sensed that this shows someone who is thinking and wants truth. This is wonderful and can cause anxiety with school/family who often want you to just \u201cmemorize facts \u201c rather than think critically \n- Tik Tok has been a wonderful source of therapy ideas for me. Remember - what you look at is what they show so train it.\n- Emotions can be painful and inconvenient. Being angry with them is reasonable but over time can make it worse. A different path is accepting them and imagining a better response. This helps because \u201cbeing angry with yourself\u201d builds habits of self hatred. Related thought - research dog training (positive reinforcement.) This is how our brains work sometimes too. \n\nThese were helpful for me and I hope they are for you :) I would like",

    "postText": "I am very hurt right now, and it's hard to embrace the feelings. My girlfriend and I have not been talking, she was being inconsistent so then I went zero contact, now I've reached out twice and nothing is coming back.\n\nI feel very abandoned and isolated. It's right in my groin. Feeling it is the way forward but by fuck it hurts.",

    "postText": "I don't know what's the best way to title it, but many years ago I told myself to stop crying. I used to be super emotional and would react normally. And I had eventually told myself that I was being immature for crying about small things (like if I was in trouble so I couldn't play games) and so every time I cried I would tell myself to stop crying. After what are essentially years I find myself unable to cry after tragic things happen, maybe a sad stare. And now I feel very bad about not being able to cry. I don't know what to do, although I have been told to talk to a doctor I don't know what to do",

I'm tired\"\n\n I literally couldn't cry for 3 yrs. I was numb.\n\nSlowly, I became appreciative of emotions again. Honestly,  having kids had a huge effect.  Caring for them reframed my youth experiences. I grew.\n\nNow, I try to embrace feelings as they come. It took practice.",

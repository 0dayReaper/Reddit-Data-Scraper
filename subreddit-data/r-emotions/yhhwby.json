    "postText": "\nHey, I don\u2019t know how to start. I feel what\u2019s happening to me is quite weird but at the same time I second-guess it so hard. I desperately want it to be normal yet can\u2019t find anyone writing anything similar on the web. I need a second opinion badly.\n\nShortly: my values are inconsistent as heck.\nNormally my greatest desire is to \u201ccare\u201d. I love that feeling. Whether I succeed or fail matters less because I\u2019m just in love in the feeling of being personally involved into something.\nI can seriously lose myself in research or studies when feeling that. That\u2019s also mostly what I enjoy in relationships. I LOATHE small-talk. It bores me\u2026 basically- most of the things that make me \u201ccare\u201d - I\u2019ll love, and if I\u2019m unable to achieve that- I\u2019ll likely feel bored and then often disgusted by it.\n\nYesterday I felt like the very definition of that. Yearned for the feeling of closeness (wanted to care about someone and someone to care about me) and genuine connection stronger than normally.\nI enjoyed myself, talking to others in a sort of hyper-enthusiastic state.\n\nToday- I found myself wanting the exact opposite. Frankly, emotions themselves felt annoying. disgusting even. I truly yearned to feel nothing just getting any ping of emotions just felt so damn irritating. The feeling of care I normally yearn for so much felt sickening. Ended up meditating and journaling for half of the day.\n\nIf I were to explain it on an example- when looking through previous diary pages, I subconsciously kept refusing to read the words and just skimmed over pages without looking (reading anything kept triggering emotions). Feeling ANY sort of feeling gave me an instant response of: \u201cNOPE, BLEH\u201d (resistance and an intense feeling of annoyance)\u2026 after which I desperately kept diverting my attention to something unrelated (like staring at a shelf) in order to keep my mind state \u201cclear\u201d, \u201cdevoid of feelings\u201d.\n\nIt got to the point where I didn\u2019t want to eat a piece of damn chocolate, not because of diet, taste or anything- just because I knew it would make me feel \u201cexcitement\u201d and I loathed the idea of feeling that emotion at all. It just felt\u2026. BLEH\n\nI\u2019m mostly over it by now. Feel kinda normal. It just weirded me out\nThe hell was that??????",

The back and forth, the inconsistency, is what seems most likely the formation of specific circumstances. \n\nIf you feel safe enough approaching it, see if you can identify a time you first felt this sequence of desperately craving connection through care, receiving it, yet being repelled by it for some reason, maybe once you felt connected you were hurt by this love in some way? This may lead you to the incident and the formative reason the pattern exists. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t feel safe to approach this, a trauma informed therapy session may help. \n\nReally cool share, pls feel welcomed to share the journey if you\u2019re up for it.",

                    "comment": "ugh is it a pattern\u2026? Now that I think of it, maybe??? Though it certainly doesn\u2019t happen to that extent normally\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to figure it out for a year. I\u2019m seriously inconsistent in relationships- again, fluctuate between high social needs, joking around, truly enjoying the company of other people\u2026 and sort of feeling annoyance, sometimes disgust when thinking of doing the exact same things with them\n\nthose 2 do tend to happen repeatedly after each other\n\nthough usually I don\u2019t really feel disgusted by the feeling of care itself\u2026 I just end up ignoring people for 1-3 days and completely losing myself in research (usually reading research papers about whatever interests me.. I DO still care about those. Today research disgusted me as well\u2026 though I guess this might just be a more intense version of the same thing)\n\nit\u2019s kinda ironic I legit didn\u2019t consider that those patterns and today\u2019s emotional freak out could be connected\n\nhell I do wonder what causes it though\n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy for about a year though for different reasons (high levels of non-structural dissociation and stress-related dissociative amnesia completely wrecking my personal effectiveness. It took a crap ton of time to figure out all of that was caused by trauma, not a medical condition + laziness\u2026 and I\u2019ve only recently started working on identifying the triggers :/ this \u201cemotional disgust pattern\u201d might be somewhat connected\u2026)(I had mild dissociative symptoms when having fun with people yesterday (don\u2019t know what caused it\u2026 Most of the time I don\u2019t), I went to sleep still happy. Had none today. Neither being in the \u201cemotional disgust\u201d state nor leaving it caused dissociative symptoms either)(argh, crap I feel like I\u2019m getting overly specific here. Might be very confusing if you don\u2019t know the terms)\n\nShortly: dissociation is a defense mechanism against stress. There is PROBABLY something in being social that triggers me though it\u2019s kinda hard to tell what exactly causes it when the disgust comes with a 1 day lag :/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are some other \u201ccoinciding patterns\u201d I noticed though\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s kinda shameful but when my social needs are high I often find myself with little personal determination, lonely, kinda yearning for someone to \u201csave me\u201d lol\n\nIt obviously reverses when not social. Usually don\u2019t get why I\u2019d ever want that, I can just do whatever I want myself\n\nI do tend to \u201csplit\u201d my perception of my parents. I can\u2019t see the \u201cgood\u201d parents (rn) and \u201cbad\u201d ones (from the past) as the same people AT ALL\n\nthough it\u2019s not like I \u201csplit\u201d my perception for anyone else like people with BPD do. No matter what happens, even when I consider my social needs disgusting- I don\u2019t devaluate my friends. I\u2019m just sickened by the feeling those interactions give me.\n\nWhatever this is, is likely linked to the past (my mother enjoys the feeling of being cared for. Often acts like a scapegoat and makes herself a victim for no reason, asking for hugs, care and support\u2026 Offers you help and love, only to blackmail you later for not appreciating her love, not giving it back, her caring so much yet you STILL doing \\[XXX\\] whenever she\u2019s in a bad mood. My father is the opposite of that. Serious, determined, straight to the point, doesn\u2019t show weakness until he literally can\u2019t bear it, is very protective of mother. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that kids need positive feedback\u2026 His only way of \u201csupporting\u201d me and my siblings is through negativity\u2026 firstly explaining what I \u201cmust\u201d do\u2026 when it doesn\u2019t work- blaming for not doing well enough in those long 40min conversations\u2026 when that doesn\u2019t work- throwing threats around, throwing my personal stuff out and just\u2026 kinda gradually removing me from the family until I \"fix\" my behavior.  I seriously don\u2019t get how that works but I do believe he seriously thinks he\u2019s \u201chelping\u201d and threats are somehow the only \u201cworking\u201d way to motivate us)\n\n(shortly\u2026 my parents are kinda a bad mix of immaturity and pure stupidity :/)\n\nargh, there could be something here though nothing clicks immediately\n\ngfdhhslhdklshndls\n\nI was never in a love relationship\u2026 was never hurt that way\n\nmy friendships were a total mess and I was bullied though the patterns I\u2019ve learned through that seem totally unrelated\n\nI can\u2019t exactly tell when this started either\u2026 at least 2 years ago?\n\nbefore that???? Argh no idea\n\n(on a side note- I don't mind openly talking about heavy stuff. Not exactly expecting to fix anything soon either... I'm unsure whether it's because I just cut off emotional access to the memories OR I truly dealt with that but talking about my memories doesn't really trigger me. I'm just curious how it works. what the heck caused it???)",

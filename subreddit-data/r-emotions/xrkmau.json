    "postText": "Is it normal to not feel any actual emotions? Like I could say I hate you, but I don\u2019t actually feel hate towards you. I\u2019ve never experienced a liking or disliking towards something. It\u2019s hard for me to make decisions bc of that. I\u2019ve never had my heart beat faster at something, never been afraid. By now I\u2019m used to acting like I do, so my face will now automatically portray the (usually) correct emotion. But I don\u2019t actually feel anything. Is this normal?",

            "comment": "Hey there. There are a few common things which block emotion on this level: depression, chemical imbalance, possible lack of mirroring from childhood development, trauma (your own or inherited.)\n\nThe good thing is you\u2019re aware of it and seeking answers. Having this experience isn\u2019t necessarily good or bad so it\u2019ll be up to you to do some exploring. \n\nFirst step might be to get your hormonal levels checked by doc to rule that out. Second step might be to pursue what you think could be a likely lead to answers, either in exploring a diagnosis of depression (not having to commit to being depressed but to learn what factors may be insightful), and perhaps to explore your history (how present were your parents in early development, were they present at all, present but occupied by stress and survival, fully present and emotionally supportive since the start?) Also potentially helpful for exploring: did anything happen to you suddenly (event trauma) or over longer period of sustained stress that could have turned your central nervous system \u2018off\u2019 as a shock / survival response?  These are generalizations and not medical advice but they may help you to discover some new insights.",

    "postText": "My best friend is going to turn off his emotions\u2026 back when I first met him his emotions were off. I didn\u2019t know any different and he seemed the same. I found out tonight that he flipped the switch back on 5-6 days after we had been talking\u2026 and that I was the one that made him flip it back on. Today he told me he was thinking of flipping it off again cause of some events that have been happening in his life\u2026 I don\u2019t know what they are and don\u2019t wanna push him for answers so I\u2019ve left it alone. The first time he flipped his switch back on he fell in love with me\u2026 and this time he is no longer in love with me and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to get him back if he does flip his switch. Any comments on what to do or how to get him back if he does flip it?",

Do you mean that he was first uninterested in you, then decided to care about you, and now he doesn\u2019t any more? \n\nEmotions/feelings control everything we do. Thoughts without feelings aren\u2019t a motivation. We can think lots of thoughts, imagine lots of plans and outcomes but it\u2019s the one which makes us feel excited that motivates us. Feelings are created by the solar plexus, it\u2019s a simple \u2018brain\u2019 in our abdomen which receives signals from outside and from our head brains and causes muscles around our internal organs to contract. Depending on exactly where they are, those contractions feel either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Our head brain knowledge of the situation fills in the rest. \n\nSo for example, your boyfriend says \u201cI don\u2019t love you any more.\u201d Your Solar plexus contracts muscles around your stomach, heart, intestines which feels \u2018bad\u2019 and your head brain knows it\u2019s loneliness and anxiety and why. So you\u2019re motivated to look for a solution, hence Reddit. \n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s love wasn\u2019t really love. He \u2018fell in love with you\u2019. That\u2019s not love. It\u2019s a hormonal reaction, based very often on a fantasy, on a false idea of someone, not on their real personality. It\u2019s often selfish and possessive and it takes no effort, it just \u2018is\u2019. Again the solar plexus makes good, happy, excited feelings which motivate us to want to see and be with that person. But it\u2019s not real love. That\u2019s why the feeling goes away again.  \n\nReal love is not a feeling. It\u2019s an action. It\u2019s the things we do for someone to help them feel happy. It\u2019s helping them with things they find hard, saying kind things when they\u2019re down, listening to them and letting them be themselves without putting them down or brushing off their feelings. It\u2019s giving them a hug and letting them know they matter. \n\nIt\u2019s kindness. Real love is kindness.\n\nIf your boyfriend is saying that he just doesn\u2019t feel as \u2018into you\u2019 anymore then sadly, that\u2019s his choice. If he\u2019s saying that to upset you and make you sad then he\u2019s a dick and you should probably look for someone more kind. You can\u2019t make someone love you. If you are being kind to them and they don\u2019t want it, that\u2019s not going to work. If they don\u2019t want to be kind and caring towards you then they don\u2019t have love to offer you. Don\u2019t waste your kindness on someone who can\u2019t be kind and caring in return.",

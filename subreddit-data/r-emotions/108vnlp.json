    "postText": "It\u2019s a gut reaction. I become very frustrated, angry, or have someone yelling at my face and without thinking the tears start streaming and my voice cracks. I\u2019m very embarrassed by this unconscious reaction to these situations. I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m a victim or I\u2019m weak- but I don\u2019t know how to keep myself from unconsciously reacting this way. Does anyone else experience this? Have you been able to overcome it? \n- \n-\n-\nToday at work a coworker asked for my assistance with an event, but I had an appointment scheduled over it. I shared with her I\u2019m happy to be a team player and always help when I can but I need to be notified ahead of time with some transparent communication  or have it on my calendar so I can plan around it. It turned into her blaming me for making her the bad guy when I was at fault for not listening to her the week prior when we discussed it at a meeting(however none of my other coworkers were aware they needed to help either, they just happened to have the time free). Since it was a big deal to her I rescheduled my appointment at last minute and showed up to the event to help. To which I was turned away by her saying she no longer needed my help and asking why I bothered showing up. I left quickly in tears and was caught by our boss who of course asked what happened, and I was so embarrassed by my emotions. I frankly don\u2019t know how to respond to passive aggressive people and stand up for myself, the tears betray me every time.",

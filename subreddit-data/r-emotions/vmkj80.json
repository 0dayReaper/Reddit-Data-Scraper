    "postText": "Hello,\n\nWe are currently recruiting individuals aged 18 years or older who are proficient in English, with normal or corrected vision, to take part in a study that examines the impact of childhood play on outcomes in adulthood.\n\nIf you decide that you want to read more information about this study (e.g., the types of questions and how your data will be handled) please follow this link: https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UBCnC61E3OIArI\n\nThe study will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete, but please feel free to take your time and spend longer on the responses.\n\nSome of the questions will ask you about your experiences of play in childhood, your mood, and will present you with social scenarios and ask for your responses.\n\nAdditionally, you will be asked to look at a series of photographs depicting eyes and state the emotion that you think is being shown.\n\nIf you feel that these types of questions may cause you distress or become triggering, there is no obligation for you to take part.\n\nIf you do decide to take part, you can stop at any time by closing the window.\n\nAny answers given will be completely confidential and anonymous.\n\nThank you\n\n[Posted with Mod permission]",

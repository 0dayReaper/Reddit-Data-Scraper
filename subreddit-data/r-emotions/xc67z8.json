It\u2019s so intense for me that I feel those emotions with my whole body. I\u2019m working on processing these emotions in a better way and I\u2019m going to therapy. \n\nBut just out of curiosity, has anyone felt so disappointed that they feel like they\u2019re emitting that emotion into whatever space they\u2019re in even though you\u2019re not showing it on the outside? For example, I have a workplace crush and I found out while working with another colleague that my crush made out with someone at a bar. \n\nLike I don\u2019t have intense feelings for my crush or anything like that, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed/a little bummed out when I heard that. I kinda stopped talking for a second but I was still focusing on my work. However, it felt like I was oozing this feeling into the room, and I don\u2019t know if I was the only one thinking this because of the way that I was feeling, but the air in the room got heavy and stiff.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think?",

I feel this too\nWhen I got to know that the boy I liked was going to marry someone else and I knew this from a friend\nAnd that day I literally cried asking to God that what did I do wrong.. Why didn't he choose me.. \nIrony was that I even didn't liked that boy with intense feeling still I felt this horrible. So be positive about everything and stay happy.",

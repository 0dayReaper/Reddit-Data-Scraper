I feel this too\nWhen I got to know that the boy I liked was going to marry someone else and I knew this from a friend\nAnd that day I literally cried asking to God that what did I do wrong.. Why didn't he choose me.. \nIrony was that I even didn't liked that boy with intense feeling still I felt this horrible. So be positive about everything and stay happy.",

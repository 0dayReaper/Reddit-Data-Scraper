    "postText": "My (28, F) cousin (also 28, F) just passed away. Due to problems among the parents, we hardly spent time together. In fact, I met her for the first time when we were around 7 years old, thanks to an uncle of ours. Later on, I found out that they lived about 10 mins away from us. We tried to spend time together since we\u2019re older but because of conflicting schedules, it wasn\u2019t possible. But we still stayed in touch through Facebook. We were into much of the same things &amp; I highly believe we would have been super close had we grown up together.\n\nI have a lot of mixed feelings: grief, sadness, a bit of anger, and guilt. My husband says that I shouldn\u2019t cry because we weren\u2019t close. He says I read into everything too much. I\u2019m an very empathetic person, but sometimes I wonder if my feelings are too extreme. In many other situations, I have been emotional &amp; I tend to cry a lot. Sometimes I thinks it isn\u2019t normal. Please help!",

And tat was the first time i experienced losing a family member. I can understand what you are going through. I  think the most important thing to do is to allow yourself to let it all out, all those emotions and the tears. Before my aunt passed away i had been dealing with problems with my dad and how he treated me from when i was younger up to now. So before i was pretty much already sad but after the loss i realized how much its affected me.\n\nI'm here for you if you want to talk about it. Just send me a message and I'll answer.",

    "postText": "A childhood friend died last night. I\u2019m not taking it well at all. On the surface I\u2019m numb, but inside is a tempest of emotions. I want to laugh in denial, cry in sadness and scream in anguish at this loss. There\u2019s the frustration and loathing at myself for not being there enough, but a cold understanding that things happened the way they did, and it was all out of my control. \n\nBut yeah. I want to scream. I want to cry. I want to express it all. But instead I just am numb. And I\u2019m content in just laying on the couch, burning hours away, hiding my numbness in vices and YouTube. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?",

            "comment": "There is nothing wrong with you. This loss of your childhood friend is hard for you and i can feel that too. I my aunt who i waa close with passed away last year unexpectedly. And tat was the first time i experienced losing a family member. I can understand what you are going through. I  think the most important thing to do is to allow yourself to let it all out, all those emotions and the tears. Before my aunt passed away i had been dealing with problems with my dad and how he treated me from when i was younger up to now. So before i was pretty much already sad but after the loss i realized how much its affected me.\n\nI'm here for you if you want to talk about it. Just send me a message and I'll answer.",

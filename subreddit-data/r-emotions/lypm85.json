If you decide to, make sure you keep note of the days where you aren't experiencing negative feedback as well. \n\nI would also try meditation when you can. The sits don't have to be long. 1 minute is plenty to start out. It maybe won't help with the disorder if you have it, but it helps with relaxation over the long haul.\n\nApart from that I would seek out a school guidance counselor or someone around you to get tested. Good luck!",

They may think you're acting like this because you're a teenager, but teenagers can be bipolar as well, so it isn't an argument.\n\nBest thing you can do is see a professional. They will help. \n\nI'm not saying you are bipolar, but if you think you may be, then you must have your reasons. As I said, you know better.",

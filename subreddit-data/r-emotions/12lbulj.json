    "postText": "In the colder half of the year i struggle pretty badly with negative emotions and am basically a mental wreck for at least two weeks, but at least im capable of accessing my emotions. Now that im at that point of change again I realise that during the warmer half of the year I just feel empty. Not bad, just, empty. My brain gets really analytical again. My feelings for my current crush fade, as do feelings in general. They are not gone, I still feel them, but in a very toned down, muffled way. \nAnd Im just confused about it. Has anyone had similar experiences or has an idea of what could be going on?",

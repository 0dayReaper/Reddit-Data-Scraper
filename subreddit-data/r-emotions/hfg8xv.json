    "postText": "Me and my sister get into arguments. In fact, my whole family gets into arguments, and I'm often at fault. Apparently. I'm not saying I'm not, it's just I don't think It's ALWAYS me.\n\nAnyway, in one argument with my sister, she talked about how I always \"Run Away\" from the argument. She talks about how she turns her emotion, in this case anger, into action. Doing things like the dishes, or the laundry... Or memorizing flowers in a floraculture test. She would be angry that a flower looked like it should be called another flowers name, and memorized it in her anger.\n\nToday, I remembered what I do when I \"Run Away\". I reflect. On the argument. On others. And myself. But I spend to much time doing that, and end up not taking action.\n\nMy sister takes action, buy doesn't know when she is actually wrong about something. And I know I have been wrong after that reflection.\n\nWe both turn our emotions into something. Sadness into reflection, and anger into action. But as individuals, we don't do both, and as a result, don't understand each other. I don't know.\n\nMaybe we need to figure out how to balance both. I want to tell her my discovery, but that would be an action. I need to figure out the balance myself first.",

It's not normal to fell not perfect for a long time. Everything i used to do was searching outside (Sozial, Work) for my INNER peace. But you cant do everything right, never.\nI wanted to make everything perfect for everyone else because I learned to give. Thought otherwise I would have nothing.\nI never accepted myself and circumstances, that's why I was stressed all the time( I didn't even realize it wasn't normal ).  Furthermore i always felt like separated from myself / empty.\n\nI already had 3 phases of extreme exhaustion, maybe even burnout or depression (Im 20 now).\nTwo months ago i started to meditate and learn about Buddhism. How to thread myself the right way because its my life. Relaxed. \nThe inner path is the only one that leads to peace.\nIn order not to be permanently tense I have to make a change in behavior and that is not easy even if you know all this. But its getting better every day.\n\n\nmy advice to you:\n\nIf it worries you, go to the doctor as a precaution and have your heart checked.\n\nDont make the same mistakes like me, take care of yourself. Feel what needs to be felt to serve as a compass/direction.\nTry to feel the emotions sincerely, get rid of this emotional blockade.\n\nMaybe try to relax yourself, awareness can help with that. \nBuddhism has good approaches when it comes to changing metal behavior. Therefore emotional.",

You don't have to dig down deeep into the Buddhism material.\n\nIt just can take some time to change the mindset.\n\nI needed like 2-3 month to partly stop overthinking. My emotions get clearer/\"better\" every week, a psychologist sad that he needed like 1 year to feel the emotions again how they are supposed to be.\n\nJust set up the right way, take your time and be gentle to yourself :)",

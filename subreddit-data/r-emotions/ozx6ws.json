            "comment": "Having this feeling is are signs of your body to tell you something.\n\nFirst what kind of depression do you got? Emotional depression (feeling empty inside) or physical depression (feeling a black hole)?\n\nThey are different. You'll get the physical depression when all signs of bodily needs are ignored and your physical and mental wellbeing is in danger. The reason is stressing about things so extremely (trauma's), you've made too much adrenalin and the adrenalin stesses the nervous system (and symtoms appear like insomnia, eating disorder, higher heart rate). You'll get more emotional because the neo-cortex doesn't work well with too much adrinaline and your limbic system is taking over (that's where our emotions come from).\n\nEmotional depression is more about living the life that you want to live (doing that makes you love yourself and give you fullfilment).\n\nBecause of experiences you've had (no matter how small) you have gained values and beliefs (about subjects, situations, others and yourself) how you should be like to survive in this (dangerous/stressful) world.\n\nBoth depressions are about not granting yourself wellbeing. Not listening to what your body and mind needs to live a healthy and happy life because we think (through our values and beliefs) we are less important for our survival then others.\n\nYou are worth it, just accept yourself as you are and try to understand yourself. Like why don't you like the reasons for being depressed? That's a negative emotion toward yourself. \n\nAnd about **reasons..** I never thought the slaps my dad gave me were causing me problems 35 years later. I just saw it as a correction. But my limbic system wants to do everything right and perfect, unknowingly I was still afraid I was going to be punished. That caused me to work harder, do better then I could and I got into a burn out. So even a small reason can have a huge impact in our behaviour. Don't ignore it and explore yourself.\n\nEdit: To get therapy is great, because you'll learn so much about yourself and the more you know the more you'll be in control of yourself.",

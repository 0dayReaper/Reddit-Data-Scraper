    "postText": "I have barely any emotions. For the most part it's joy/happiness I lack. It's the most concerning for me too. I used to feel joy from small things such as going out shopping or relaxing after a long day. They feel ok, I like it but it doesn't make me happy like it used to. I did suffer from DPDR for a year and just now \"got over it\" and I'm left with emotionlessness. I just want to feel joy and happiness again. My description of it isn't even as bad as it truly is. Please give advice or a label to this, I just need something. Reassurance even.",

I feel sadness sometimes, like in movies and stuff but not near as emotional as I used to be (and I'd like to go back to being emotional)",

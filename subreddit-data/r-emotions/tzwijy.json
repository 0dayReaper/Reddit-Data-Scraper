    "postText": "I've been talking to this guys and he was really amazing and sweet. He always tells me how much he likes me and wants to be with him and I kinda gave back the same energy as him. Then yesterday came around, we talked while I was in school and then when I got home, I stopped texting him and we both stopped texting each other so I started fixing up my hair and all of a sudden I text him and the message don't go through... It doesn't say \" not delivered\" it sent but without saying delivered and that usually happens when his phone dies so I thought his phone died. I wait a couple of mins that turn into hours and my message still haven't went through. I then look at the messages and it went through but I'm left on delivered. I'm still left on delivered today and I sent more messages and they're still not going through. I honestly don't think he would do this if everyday he told me he likes me and etc. I don't wanna be negative and think he just ghost me but then he hasn't told me if he's ok or anything. I texted his instagram too and no reply. I'm worried something happened to him. What should I do?",

The thing is we don't live in the same state, he lives 10hrs away from me. He definitely didn't block me cause I checked and he didn't... His phone is definitely turned off because I can tell. Usually when you're blocked it rings once and then goes straight to voicemail but it didn't do that. So I think his phone is turned off but I'm gonna think positive for now and see where it goes from there. Thank you again for the advice&lt;33",

There are guys who do that for some reason, they block them at the end and leave them wondering. It wasn't your fault, people are stupid sometimes. Just like when you see a troll on reddit; you simply ignore it. Much love",

I can't really do anything else so there is really no point in letting it keep playing in it my head if I can't do anything about it.

He wasn\u2019t the \u201cright person\u201d but I learned how I should be treat so that was a bonus out of all of that. At the end of the day you guys really helped me, so I want to say thank you once again &lt;33",

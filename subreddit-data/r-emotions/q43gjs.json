    "postText": "I feel disconnected with my emotions, so much so that it feels like when I experience them, that it's only a small amount of that emotion. \nIt feels like theres a ball inside me and all of my feelings are trapped inside of it and only bits and pieces come out at a time, I'm never super happy or super excited, etc. The only emotion I can truly feel is anger, not that I'm a mad person, not at all, what I mean is that when i am angry, i can truly feel all of it and it doesnt feel like its locked away. \nThat and sadness/hurt. I can feel a great deal of hurt, almost anxiety and I can tell that's real, but not all the time. I feel like all of my emotions are fake and that I'm not really feeling them at all, I dont usually panic or anything because my feelings dont take a big play. It's hard to explain. I also cant form any type of relationship (in my heart) with other people, like I have a lot of people in my life and I like them and their my friends but deep down in my heart, I dont love them or really like them too much.. its confusing for me too.\nI dont like being around them a whole lot or telling them about me or showing them what little emotions I do have; but I have affection though, and I am very affectionate. It's not that I CANT show emotion or am unwilling, I am very friendly and outgoing and such. I just.. I cant seem to form any type of REAL love with people, like the feeling I get with my family. I dont like anyone else like that, I cant seem to.. I dont know. Love them. It's hard.\nRelationships arent my strong spot either, the thought of it is nice to me in theory but it took me 8 months to even kiss a guy, and I feel no romantic connection with people, yes I liked telling him I loved him and I believe I did to a point but idk.\nI feel so dead with emotions, yet this does not mean I'm sad! Most of the time I'm in a state of contempt, since emotions arent that strong, when bad things happen to me, it's hard to even care. I dont care about much of anything, but I'm not sad. I'm usually pretty happy.\n\nA bit of a summery: I dont really understand what emotions feel like unless I'm experiencing them (even then it only feels half hearted) and when I'm not experiencing them, it feels like I've never in my entire life, like when I'm happy in my mind I've always been happy and when I'm sad I've always been sad, ect. I have no real connection with people and when things happen, it just slides right off me bc I cant seem to care, although I'm usually not sad. I'm usually in a constant state of content because I cant seem to understand emotion/or care.",

No mention of what actually has happened to you and how to practically process it.\n\nI also don't really feel emotion. The first time in years was the other night after leaving a gig, I got a feeling that we feel emotion when we are around people we can relate to? You should probably pursue your interests. Also life changes the older you get in big ways. You'll be surprised. I'd speak to a doctor if I were you. Where do you live? Are you in conditions you don't like? Do you really like your friends, the real you...? There's a lot of helpful questions we can look at. My inbox is always open to you and don't feel like you have to hold back. I've seen a lot :D make it happen I believe i",

Like at some points I enjoy things but not really. I know in the post it says how I'm explaining supposed to feel and I think you're right about it, like how am I supposed to feel? I just feel like I'm missing something. When I feel an emotion, I feel empty and like there's supposed to be MORE, you know what I mean? I don't know if I really like my friends. At some points I feel like I hate them, but why? I love them a lot (at least my version of love), at some points, I feel like I can't live without them.. I don't know if I like the real me either, but I'm not faking any part of it so I don't know what I could do about that lol. I most likely will speak advice from a doctor, thank you very much for your reply, it helped a lot.",

Did you know that there are around 34.000 different emotions? We don't learn to communicate our feelings in so many societies all around the world, and instead suppress them and feel anger and such.\nHow would it be for you to spend some of your time, 3 hours 5 minutes to be exact, and enjoy a wonderful workshop about non-violent communication (aka Giraf language - it's explained in the video)\nIt has really helped me learn to express my feelings, and revert my anger towards others actions to feeling empathy for them instead.\nIf you feel like it, search for Marshall Rosenberg San Francisco workshop on YouTube. It's really fun too, he's got a great sense of humor.\nI suggest to watch it in bits, if it seems too long.\n\nI wish for you all the best.",

I suppose that it could be my communication skills that factor into a lot of my issues with emotions and learning more about emotion could probably help me understand them and feel them a bit better. I'll watch the video you recommended, thank you so much for commenting. It means a lot, I really needed someone to talk to about it.\n\nI wish you the best too!",

So, from a few other comments that I'm seeing, I'm starting to realize that I need a better understanding of the emotion before I can actually recognize that I'm feeling that way so learning about what emotion is is probably my first goal.\n\nI also agree about what you mean by the \"I dont care\" phase\" I think it is from me not wanting to be hurt by things and so I just let it slide off instead of actually adressing my emotions in a healthy affective way, and that's why in more situations, I cant understand/know/feel my emotions.\n\nI believe the reason I cant love is the unknowing wall, I think I'm scared to actually love someone in fear they'll hurt me and I dont want to give them that vulnerability. Thank you so much, I think I will try to spend more time on myself and what I believe to be love, etc.\n\nThank you very much for your comment, talking to people about this is really helping me to understand it. It means a lot that you took time out to reply. God bless!",

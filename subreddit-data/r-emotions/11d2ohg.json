    "postText": "Sorry this rant is a little bit all over the place\n\nSo I'm (18f) not really religious anymore but I really don't have the heart to tell my mom that I don't enjoy going to church so she still drags me with her on Sunday and online bible studies on Saturdays.\n\n Yesterday, I went to bible studies and no one else was there except for the teacher so we started casually started talking about what we got up to the during the week and other small talk topics. Randomly I got asked out of nowhere if I had a boyfriend and it was a huge shock to me. I said no and then he had asked me why not so I replied that I was wanted to focus on school at the moment (which isn't really true, I just haven't met anyone I like or reciprocates those feelings). \n\nHe asked me why I started rambling and if that question made me feel uncomfortable. It did, but I said it didn't. I'm not sure why I answered him, that's not really his business right? We moved onto another topic and eventually the time ran up and the time for class ended. It got me thinking if I seems like I should have one? I've never been in an actual relationship before and I feel like I missed out on \"teenage romance\". I think I felt shitty that I got reminded once again that I'm not in a relationship but also weirded out that a grown man is concerned about my relationship status. This isn't the first time he's brought up relationship status. He made a whole ass lesson about how common law relationships aren't valid and asked all the girls if we've had abortions and slept with guys before.",

            "comment": "Your feeling are of course valid! \nCompletely inappropriate questions from your \u201cteacher\u201d.\nThis is exactly the kind of behaviour and way of thinking that is rampant in religious groups. It\u2019s disgusting. \n\nThere\u2019s is absolutely NO rush to be in a relationship. Trust me, there are SO many people who never have a relationship until they\u2019re in their 20s. If you haven\u2019t found someone who you click with yet, then that\u2019s absolutely fine! Please don\u2019t let anyone make you feel weird about that. They\u2019re the ones who should feel weird about pressuring a god damn 18 yo into getting into a relationship. It\u2019s disgraceful. \n\n\nYou. Do. You. \n\nI understand no wanting to tell your mother you don\u2019t want to go to church, but you\u2019re technically an adult now. She can\u2019t force you. She\u2019ll get over it. \nPersonally, I would get out of those circles asap. \nOrganised religion is poison. Especially in the US. It\u2019s terrifying to the rest of the (western) world how extreme it is. \nI believe in some higher power, but I don\u2019t need religion to tell me how to be a good person or how to live my life. You don\u2019t either. \n\nSorry for the slight rant. But when I hear these kinds of stories red flags just start jumping up in my brain.\n\nI hope you find your solution to your situation \ud83d\ude4f\n\nTL;DR Your feeling are absolutely valid. It\u2019s creepy and weird to be talked to like that by a teacher. \nTell your mother that\u2019s you\u2019re an adult and you don\u2019t want to go anymore.",

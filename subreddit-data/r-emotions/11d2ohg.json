            "comment": "Your feeling are of course valid! \nCompletely inappropriate questions from your \u201cteacher\u201d.\nThis is exactly the kind of behaviour and way of thinking that is rampant in religious groups. It\u2019s disgusting. \n\nThere\u2019s is absolutely NO rush to be in a relationship. Trust me, there are SO many people who never have a relationship until they\u2019re in their 20s. If you haven\u2019t found someone who you click with yet, then that\u2019s absolutely fine! Please don\u2019t let anyone make you feel weird about that. They\u2019re the ones who should feel weird about pressuring a god damn 18 yo into getting into a relationship. It\u2019s disgraceful. \n\n\nYou. Do. You. \n\nI understand no wanting to tell your mother you don\u2019t want to go to church, but you\u2019re technically an adult now. She can\u2019t force you. She\u2019ll get over it. \nPersonally, I would get out of those circles asap. \nOrganised religion is poison. Especially in the US. It\u2019s terrifying to the rest of the (western) world how extreme it is. \nI believe in some higher power, but I don\u2019t need religion to tell me how to be a good person or how to live my life. You don\u2019t either. \n\nSorry for the slight rant. But when I hear these kinds of stories red flags just start jumping up in my brain.\n\nI hope you find your solution to your situation \ud83d\ude4f\n\nTL;DR Your feeling are absolutely valid. It\u2019s creepy and weird to be talked to like that by a teacher. \nTell your mother that\u2019s you\u2019re an adult and you don\u2019t want to go anymore.",

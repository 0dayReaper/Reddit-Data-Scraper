    "postText": " \n\nSometimes, it hurts too much. When you feel too much, a sensory overload. Everything is amplified and you leave in a hurry trying to make it seem alright. Emotions. All these fucking emotions left inside, swirling around like fish stuck in a cheap ten dollar glass bowl. Swimming around and around and around in dreadful circles. Emotions. Emotions! Stuck in a salsa dance with the devil while you try to pull away but your feet are stuck in the same old steps in stance. Switch it up but its still tiring. It's always tiring. Is life really worth living? Is it any good, why am I so fucking emotional, I can't take it anymore.   \nAnd when I try to get rid of the emotions, when I try to harden up they always seem to crawl back to me. They cling to me with claws of hurt aching into my tender piece of flesh called heart. A shadow that never leaves no matter how much light you shine on it. Running around in circles with myself. Every night I'm dancing the same old waltz, soon it turns into obsessive seizures of heartache. Crying myself to sleep.\n\nGreat now I hate myself.   \nSometimes it hurts too much. Sometimes it feels as if I'm a ticking time bomb. Cutting wire after wire in hopes of diffusing the tension, or better letting it burst open only to have to pick up the pieces it leaves behind and rebuild yourself. \n\nOnly to fall apart again.",

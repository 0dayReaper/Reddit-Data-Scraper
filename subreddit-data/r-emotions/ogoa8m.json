Its ok to feel guilt, its human and i feel it when we do it at my job. However, typically they let you stay in the room and usually let you look them in the eye and let you love them till they pass, and if you don\u2019t then I all but guarantee one of the staff will do it if you don\u2019t. \n\nAbove all else, you\u2019re doing the right thing. Its gonna hurt, and that makes us human. Accept it and grow from it because some people are selfish and would rather keep a suffering animal alive so they can have a few extra months with a dying animal.",

    "postText": "(Names changed to protect anyone who might know my friend.)   \n\nLet me set the scene. I knew Sam for over a decade, although we\u2019d never physically met. For the first four years it was all emails and blog posts, with a shared love of the written word we worked together on an e-zine. As time passed, we did an occasional zoom chat to say hi and check in, and with his belief in Santeria I was happy to let him do prophecy readings for me; the Santeria version of a tarot reading used bones and numbers similar to the Chinese methods.   \n\nOver time, while not particularly close, I was happy to call this man a friend. His choice of lifestyle, however, meant that the medical system would eventually fail him. Sam succumbed to a brain tumor.   \n\nA call went out on his Facebook page asking for help, for his dog had no home and was living alone in the RV he shared with Sam, his only companionship being that of a friend checking in a few times a day to feed him and let him out for a potty break.   \n\nI was living alone at the time and had been wanting a dog, so I stepped up. It was a spur of the moment decision, and I knew nothing of the dog or his history or anything. It simply felt like the right decision at the time.  \n\nI was living far away at the time, and made a long loop over thanksgiving weekend to spend the holiday with my parents and then drove to Sam\u2019s to go pick up this dog, whom I\u2019d learned his full name was seven different names put together.  (Part of Santeria culture includes long names.). \n\nI met this dog on a cold Friday night, after driving through the dark and rain to get there. I didn\u2019t even know until I saw him that he was an 80 pound pitbull full of energy. I called him by his full name and he immediately bounded over to me, as though he simply knew his rescuer had come.    \n\nFrom that moment on, we were bonded.   \n\nHe was excited to jump into my car and get some treats, and a stuffed lamb toy that he destroyed in seconds. We made the long drive to his new home in Vegas, and began the process of getting to know each other.   \n\nThe first stop, he saw a small dog which yipped at him. my new friend growled and snarled at the small dog, but otherwise left him alone.  This started a long journey of aggression and dangerous behavior that I couldn\u2019t have known I was getting myself into.   \n\nIn time, I learned he wasn't well socialized, and he did not, as they say, play well with others.   \n\nIn time, I learned his mom had been shot by a police officer during a domestic disturbance call.   \n\nIn time, I got him to at least tolerate my cat.   \n\nIn time, I learned he had never been to a vet in his life.  \n\nIn time, I got him to be friends with my rabbit.   \n\nIn time, he bit five people, and once latched on to the cheek of my girlfriend's dog so hard I had to pry him off.   \n\nIn time, after 19 months together, I have had to make the decision to have him put down.   \n\nI\u2019m crushed by this decision.   \n\nI adopted this dog blindly, yes, but I also adopted a dog of a friend that passed away. I feel a deep pain as though I\u2019ve let both him and Sam down.  I have been told by Sam\u2019s caretaker that his dying wishes were to make sure his dog was taken care of.    \n\nI have failed in that.  Is there shame in failing? No. I don\u2019t feel shame. I feel regret at not being good enough.  Maybe I wasn\u2019t patient enough with him. Maybe I didn\u2019t try hard enough to socialize him. Maybe this, maybe that.    \n\nMaybe I over think things and life has handed me a no win situation.   Even without the bite history, finding a new home for a five year old pitbull with low socialization skills is an impossible task.  With the bite history, it\u2019s simply impossible.   \n\nAnd so it falls to me to make the hard choice. This dog that has snuggled me and been my warmth in dark nights during the solitude of Covid lockdowns must now be discarded as he\u2019s no longer convenient in my life.   \n\nToo harsh? Of course it is. That\u2019s what guilt does to us. We find the worst possible ways to torture ourselves for what choices we\u2019ve made.    \n\nHow to handle this guilt becomes the question.   \n\nMaybe by realizing that if I hadn\u2019t come along, he would likely have been put down 19 months ago. I\u2019ve extended his life by over a year and a half, showing him a love and tender caring that (if I may brag) few others would show to a rescue.   \n\nMaybe by realizing that with his bite history, I\u2019m likely saving a human life, as it\u2019s only a matter of time before he slips out of my control and bites someone mortally.  \n\nAs I lay in bed writing this, his bulky form taking up more than half of my pillow space, and his snoring echoing through the house, I lay a hand on him and realize that all dogs in our lives are temporary. The very nature of a dogs lifespan is only a decade or so. While I\u2019ve had him for less than two years, we\u2019ve had some amazing and fun times together. (Along with a few high anxiety times.).  \n\nSo I feel the guilt. It\u2019s human. I lay with it, and embrace the emotion and allow it to pass through me and know that I\u2019m making the right decision, no matter how hard it is.   \n\nWhen the time comes in eight days, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have the strength to be in the room to help him die.  No euphemistic words here. He\u2019s not transitioning. He\u2019s not passing on. He\u2019s going to die.  I read somewhere that Euthanasia means \u201cgood death\u201d.   \n\nI hope I can put aside that guilt in time, so that I can be there for him. To take what is a known scary and terrifying place in a cold vet hospital, and let him die looking into the eyes of the one that rescued him from living alone in an RV, and gave him nearly two years of comfort and happiness.   \n\nAnd then I\u2019ll return home to an empty bed, the house a little colder, a little emptier, and I\u2019ll sit with myself for a while.  Maybe I\u2019ll cry, maybe I won\u2019t. But my hope is that during that night I can merge the guilt with a peace that he is in a better spot where no harm can come to him, and he can no longer hurt someone else.",

Its ok to feel guilt, its human and i feel it when we do it at my job. However, typically they let you stay in the room and usually let you look them in the eye and let you love them till they pass, and if you don\u2019t then I all but guarantee one of the staff will do it if you don\u2019t. \n\nAbove all else, you\u2019re doing the right thing. Its gonna hurt, and that makes us human. Accept it and grow from it because some people are selfish and would rather keep a suffering animal alive so they can have a few extra months with a dying animal.",

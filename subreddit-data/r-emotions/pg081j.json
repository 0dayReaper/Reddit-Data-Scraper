I know that he has a nintendo switch and he plays games, and he he has friends to play with. I feel kinda bad cause I also want to play with him too, we should be spending the night playing games together, or chatting, but instead, I spend the nights without interacting with him. This is not how I wanted things to turn out. I wish things could be different.",

Men too.\n\nIf you find you can't talk to your friends after trying (and you still want to stay friends, which is understandable, not all friends are there for emotional support, some are just for fun. Well, most are...) then reach out to a therapist if possible, don't mind the stigma or whatever. Talk to your parents or siblings if you have a good relationship with them. Don't keep it to yourself cause that just sucks and makes the negativity worse.",

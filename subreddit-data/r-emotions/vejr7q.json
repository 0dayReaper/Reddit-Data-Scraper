I sat down for a minute to drink something in the back cuz I was hot and the one chick asked if I could clock out smh I texted the boss about it cuz I did wanna work there but the new location doesn't open til end of the month. I really tried but I got a bad vibe from that bitch anyways. Now I gotta find another job I'm sure",

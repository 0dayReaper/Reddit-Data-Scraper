    "postText": "M32 for what it matters. I've been thinking a lot about love for the last couple of months. For a long time (years) I've felt a bit emotionally numb, but since last summer my emotions have been coming back with more strongly.\n\nI've find it interesting that I do feel that I love my romantic partners of course. But I also really **love** some of my friends with the same passion. I'm not romantically interested in them but the feelings are just so strong it's sometimes even hard to handle. \n\nWith that being said some of my platonic friends are very close, way closer than I've ever let anyone become before.\n\nI don't know if this is a normal experience because I feel truly blessed to be able to feel so much love in my life.",

Usually time only helps if the system is strong enough to process that older junk so good on ya ;)\n\nYes it\u2019s a very good sign that you\u2019re back \u2018online\u2019 with your feelings, especially with love. Of course there are some types of love, yada-yada, but the point is you\u2019re right where you want to be. Here. Present. Feeling your connections. Awesome news!",

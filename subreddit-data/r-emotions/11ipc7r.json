The best thing you can do is accept that you are exactly how you are meant to be. All the time. \n\nAppreciate how complex and special you really are. There is no one like you. You can see the world through your eyes and see things that others would miss. And other people see things that you miss.\n\nEvery second, there are truly infinite experiences occurring in tandem.\n\nThat's always true. So don't feel bad about yourself when you feel misunderstood.  Be curious about the differences between people.\n\nBe curious about what people see. But don't judge. Please don't judge others or yourself. Try to understand instead.",

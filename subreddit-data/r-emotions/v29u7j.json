    "postText": "I've never been seen as an approachable person, not someone people can confide in or have deeper conversations with. Throughout the years I figured it was the initial meeting of a person that was the most important to being approachable. So I worked on my smile; making it smoother, nicer, friendly-er. Then I worked on my conversations; better opening lines, more superficial conversations, etc. The better I got the more I feel like I've built a wall of Kindness to stand behind. I don't like the wall I've built but it feels so fundamental to seeming friendly and speaking to others easier. I hate how fake it feels. But I have to know, does anyone else feel that way?",

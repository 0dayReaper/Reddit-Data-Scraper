    "postText": "So, my brother \\[19M\\] and my best friend \\[22M\\] have been flirting for some time now and I recently found out they had made out a couple of times. \n\nI talked it out with both of them, I was really pissed at first but I realized my best friend has had a crush on my brother for over a year, and I feel bad telling him how angry that makes me because at the end of the day he can't control who he likes. Obviously, like everyone, he has his things, but generally, he has been a great friend to me up to this point and I do cherish our friendship very much. So I really want to get over it but I just can't. \n\nLike, my friend is going to Amsterdam soon with some of our friends, (where my brother currently lives) , they're all staying in different places, and I just know my friend is going to want to stay at my brother's (because they have also become friends over this past year, however friends that have made out like 3 times? so idk but yeah they'll hang out sometimes), and it makes me so angry. \n\nThe way he looks at my brother makes me so angry, the way he goes out of his way to be near him and flirt with him. It just gets on my nerves so much. But I just can't get to the bottom of why it makes me feel like this! I don't want to feel like this, I love them both and I think it's great they have fun together because I want them both to be happy. I try to shake it off but when I see, hear or think something about the situation it just throws me off the edge and I feel like I can't even look at them.  \n\nI would appreciate if someone could give me ideas of why this could be. Or maybe suggestions of questions to ask myself to get to the bottom of this. I think once I understand why I feel like this I will be able to start moving on. \n\nAny help is appreciated! Thank you!",

            "comment": "A good question to always ask yourself is: what do you want? \n\nWhen it comes to your brother, your friend, and/or their possible relationship, what is it that you really want? And then ask yourself why. And keep asking why again to each answer until you get to the route of what you really want and why you want it. Whatever it is, just face it and be honest with yourself. \n\nThere is no problem with feeling any certain way. We all feel all sorts of things. It's ok to feel anything. What matters is knowing how to change how you feel if you want to, and most importantly, how we respond to our feelings. \n\nSometimes it just takes a tiny shift in perspective to change how we feel about something. Most of the time when we get stuck in a certain feeling, it is because a part of us may unconsciously want to keep feeling that way. Emotions only last for 90 seconds in the body - any longer than that is us choosing to remain feeling it. \n\nWhy not be happy for your brother and your friend having a relationship? Relationships are beautiful things and there are so many possibilities for people to enjoy their time together in all sorts of ways. Don't see it as something you may be losing, if that might be the case. Instead try to see what these two important people in your life that you care about may be gaining.",

Part of you automatically judges every experience by this ideal. when someone or something violates it, you subconsciously label them as evil for the violation... evil must be punished and/or destroyed... but part of you is aware that this is a falsehood, the ideal you were given is not the truth, not something you wish for your own personal goal... you can dig it out, understand it came from everything surrounding your upbringing... it told you to what to do but it does not make you do it.",

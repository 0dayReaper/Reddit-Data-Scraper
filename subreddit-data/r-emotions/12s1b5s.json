            "comment": "A good question to always ask yourself is: what do you want? \n\nWhen it comes to your brother, your friend, and/or their possible relationship, what is it that you really want? And then ask yourself why. And keep asking why again to each answer until you get to the route of what you really want and why you want it. Whatever it is, just face it and be honest with yourself. \n\nThere is no problem with feeling any certain way. We all feel all sorts of things. It's ok to feel anything. What matters is knowing how to change how you feel if you want to, and most importantly, how we respond to our feelings. \n\nSometimes it just takes a tiny shift in perspective to change how we feel about something. Most of the time when we get stuck in a certain feeling, it is because a part of us may unconsciously want to keep feeling that way. Emotions only last for 90 seconds in the body - any longer than that is us choosing to remain feeling it. \n\nWhy not be happy for your brother and your friend having a relationship? Relationships are beautiful things and there are so many possibilities for people to enjoy their time together in all sorts of ways. Don't see it as something you may be losing, if that might be the case. Instead try to see what these two important people in your life that you care about may be gaining.",

            "comment": "all of time has brought about this present moment and only this present moment... you have not be taught to accept reality as it unfolds, but rather to work towards an ideal(one not completely of your own making). Part of you automatically judges every experience by this ideal. when someone or something violates it, you subconsciously label them as evil for the violation... evil must be punished and/or destroyed... but part of you is aware that this is a falsehood, the ideal you were given is not the truth, not something you wish for your own personal goal... you can dig it out, understand it came from everything surrounding your upbringing... it told you to what to do but it does not make you do it.",

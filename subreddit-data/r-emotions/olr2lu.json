This week has been all over the place emotionally but I've been better with managing expectations, not taking anything too personally, minding my business, and letting go of that which no longer contributes to my best self.. behaviors, patterns, people, etc. I've also been more clear minded and decisive, something I've struggled with greatly in life. In conclusion, it's been a great week and thank you for asking. How are you feeling?",

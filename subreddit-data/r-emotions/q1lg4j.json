    "postText": "My wife has said I am not open enough and do not share my emotions. I am not very good at this and have bought a couple of books to help try to understand and figure out my emotions and how to share them.\nOne issue I have is she is very sick and refuses to figure out the true cause. This leaves me heartbroken and feeling helpless.\nI would also like help on naming another emotion I am having. My heart goes out to her and I feel so bad for her for the pain and suffering she is going through. Do I just label this sympathy? Any other names people can think of?",

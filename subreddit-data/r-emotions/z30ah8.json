    "postText": "Sometimes when the setting is just right, during a sunset or in the middle of the night and im listening to a certain kind of music or even just in the right mindstate, it'll start to feel like nothing matters. Not in the sense that I don't want to live, just that it feels like if everything just happened to end right there and then and the credits rolled, I wouldn't mind. It kind of feels like a blissful serenity, and I love the feeling, it brings me so much peace and nostalgia and general calmness. I don't want to end my life, I'm generally quite optimistic for it, and I feel especially appreciative of being alive when I feel like this believe it or not. I just want to try and identify what this is so that I can understand it better.",

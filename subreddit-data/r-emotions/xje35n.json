It\u2019s your body being present and connected to your life..(Which is a good thing.) It\u2019s healthy to cry so your body can discharge what\u2019s building up inside. But rather than thinking about \u201cgetting rid\u201d of it, it might be more helpful to ask, how much of the emotion can you allow in your experience..? This will help with building your comfort level and capacity to process emotions rather than developing a need to escape them. Hope that helps!",

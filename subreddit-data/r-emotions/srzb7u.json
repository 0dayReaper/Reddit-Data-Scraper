I am relating not a specific instance of this, but I have been feeling this way my entire life. Is this healthy to do? Can I actually stop those thoughts in my head, and how, or do I just have to live with this?",

I just like to start over but something I can't start over. I'm not a therapist or anything but I think this is mental and what I mean by that is you don't like making mistakes and when you make enough for yourself you just want to throw it away. You are too hard on yourself and its ok because I am hard on myself too. You just want it to be right with less mistakes.",

    "postText": "So I have been feeling these weird emotions lately. Since it's fall and winter is coming up, I thought it would be my depression again. Because last year during winter I was really suicidal and it probably was the worst moment of my life. I felt absolutely miserable and empty. \n\n Now the empty like feeling is coming back. This feeling like my body is hollow. But I do not feel the sadness, I don't feel emotion at all. Only anger. \n\n But I also feel a sense of calmness and peacefulness. The word and my mind used to seem too loud. There was always something happening, never stopping to rest, but now everything stopped and went quiet.\n\n I don't enjoy anything anymore. And the things I still might enjoy doing I can't because it reminds me of my friends and I just want to throw up because of it. I hate remembering their annoying voices and their warm and sweaty hands on me. (I don't particularly hate my friends, I'm just a huge loner and hate physical touch).\n\n I feel like I have no other purpose in life. I can't even take care of myself. I don't have the energy to do anything; I don't know why I still go to school, why I still put on a mask so other people would think I feel something.\n\n I used to be suicidal because of sadness and how horrible my life is, but now I'm suicidal because I feel calm, like I accomplished my mission and need to get my well-deserved rest.\n\nThis started out as a question but now is a vent, but if anybody knows what is that feeling of emptiness/peacefulness please I would like to know! Have a good day/night :)",

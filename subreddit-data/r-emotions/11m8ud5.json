    "postText": "I will be a bridesmaid to one of my childhood friend this year. As of lately, I have been feeling an emotion of jealousy. I am trying my best to self-reflect to find why I feel this way and how to manage it. \n\nAs I try to self-reflect, I found some POSSIBLE reasons as to why I feel this way. It may not be true because once again, I am trying to navigate in my mind why I feel this way.\n\nUpon self-reflection, I found that:\n\n\u2022 I may feel jealous because I never been this close to a successful marriage developing before my eyes. \n\n\u2022 When we were teens, my friend had also a male bestfriend to who I ended up in a situationship and caused some fallout between us. The situationship didn\u2019t last for more than maybe 3-4 months. \n\nA couple of months later, my friend confessed to me and asked if I was okay with her dating the same guy. I was fully over him and said that it was totally fine with me. A few months later, they were in a relationship with each other.\n\nAs time passed, I started to dislike the fact that my friend and him were together. I guess it was because I felt as though she broke girl code despite the fact that I gave her the ok to do so. \n\nHe was also genuinely an asshole to me, her and his previous ex. He called her a whore because there were dudes texting her and began to hit her.I was angry at him and her by now. I disliked the fact that she prioritized their relationship before ours. She knew this guy was not a good person because everyone (her mother, his sister and other friends) warned her about him.\n\nI got over all those feelings and accepted things as they were.\n\nWe went our separate ways and continued to live the life that we all were making.\n\nThen, they broke up, and she moved back in town. She started to reach out to me because she was extremely sad over the breakup. She wanted to reconnect with family and friends. \n\nTwo months in after the breakup, she meets a guy (her now fianc\u00e9). He was respectful to her, showed her love and attention. He was a kind person and respectful to me as well and all her friends and family.\n\nIt was a breath of fresh air for her and all of us as well. \n\nHowever, I knew at heart that she was not fully over her ex because she continued to text him. But she would keep it a secret to myself and others.\n\nAs time passed, once again, she became further and further away from me and closer to her boyfriend. Super understandable because women typically do that once they have a boyfriend.\n\nYears pass by and I start hearing from her again. Turns out she now has three kids and was recently going through a depressive state of mind. I never probed as to why because I am aware how sensitive these topics of depression can be.\n\nOne day, when she was going through a misscarriage and I was there throughout most of the process. I genuinely wanted to be there for her. In that time, she confessed to me the reason why her and her now fianc\u00e9 did not marry before children. Turns out, she was trying to get over her ex, which in turn made her fianc\u00e9 jealous and angry. Not to mention that her ex would pop up at her job and send flowers to her Mother\u2019s house.\n\nHer ex finally stopped reaching out and things started to calm down for them.\n\n\u2014I said all of this because it may be a reason why I might feel jealous. Or maybe Im confusing jealousy with pain. It maybe Possibly because things worked out for her after she somewhat hurt me unintentionally and I felt as though her apology for doing what she did was not as sincere as it should of been.\n\n\u2022 I feel like she reached out to me because she lacks friends and needed someone as close to her as I was with her when we were children for the sake of her wedding. I know for a fact that once the wedding is done, her level of communication with me will be little to none. This hurts because Im not someone you can just use and dispense once you get what you needed from me.\n\nShe is trying to make her marriage seem perfect:\n\nIm sure they have gone through ups and downs but they make it seem so flawless. They\u2019re are also Catholic church go\u2019ers. But I ve seen the way my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 reacts when he is jealous of my friend when men look at her and it makes me question his reaction towards it. \n\nMy friend use to be promiscuous but kept it to herself. Which is understandable but now she has changed into a better woman. I am proud of her for changing. However, she is now a church go\u2019er because she met her fianc\u00e9, not because she was independently moved by the religion. \n\n\nI am not a \u201cbad\u201d person. I am not someone who typically wishes the worse on someone who is living life differently than I am. There\u2019s no envy lingering here for sure. I just dislike this feeling of jealousy for a friend who seems happy with how her life is going. If I knew that I would be jealous of this situation, I would not have been part of it. I am now starting to regret saying yes to being a bridesmaid.\n\nMy question to reddit is, how can I overcome these feelings so that I can be a better person for myself and the people who I surround myself with? Should I kindly tell her I am not the person who should partake as her bridesmaid? Should I talk to her about this feeling? I genuinely do not know what to do.",

Now that you clarified, I may be having feelings of envy more than jealousy.\n\nI think I want her image of what it looks like when someone actually wants you and wants to marry you. I also think I may be envious of how easy it is for her to get with a man. \n\nI also remember feeling envious of her when my situationship wanted to be with her instead of me\u2014in this particular case, the feeling of envy didn\u2019t last long because I knew he was a bad person.",

But where's it coming from?\n\nYou just want to fall in love some day too?\n\nThat's a good goal.\n\nYou can't take hers but you'll get yours someday, I'm sure.\n\nBesides, to be like her you'd have to change your entire personality, and that's the most beautiful thing there is about you.\n\nI wouldn't be envious.\n\nSounds like she gets a lot of emotional strain from being promiscuous and having bad taste in men.\n\nYou don't want that stress in your life.\n\nJust be grateful you're not her.\n\nAnd be hopeful she lucked out with this one \n(Hope he isn't another mistake she's making).\n\nSome people think with their loins and it gets them into a boatload of trouble (I should know so, I have my moments where I let my crotch make decisions for me and it usually ends in regret or embarrassment).\n\nSo... yeah.  Just keep being yourself.  You're beautiful the way you are homie",

As I grew up, I noticed how hypocritical and almost manipulative people take the Word of God just to get what they want from someone else.\n\nNow as an adult, Im watching my childhood friend become part of the church community and actually having a perfectly/imperfect relationship. \n\nI am genuinely happy for her. I guess Im also comparing my experiences with her. I feel horrible for doing so but my mind cannot help to do it. She definitely got lucky with this guy because there are quite a few traits in him that I usually do not see in other men, which is a good thing.\n\nI just really hate these feeings that arise of envy.\n\nThank you for stating how being different is beautiful because I think Im also doing this as well. I feel like Im constantly comparing myself to her and this sh*t feels weird.\n\nBecause why am I comparing myself to her? She is not a competition, she is a friend.",

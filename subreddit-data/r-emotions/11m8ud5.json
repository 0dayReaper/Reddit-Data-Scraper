Now that you clarified, I may be having feelings of envy more than jealousy.\n\nI think I want her image of what it looks like when someone actually wants you and wants to marry you. I also think I may be envious of how easy it is for her to get with a man. \n\nI also remember feeling envious of her when my situationship wanted to be with her instead of me\u2014in this particular case, the feeling of envy didn\u2019t last long because I knew he was a bad person.",

But where's it coming from?\n\nYou just want to fall in love some day too?\n\nThat's a good goal.\n\nYou can't take hers but you'll get yours someday, I'm sure.\n\nBesides, to be like her you'd have to change your entire personality, and that's the most beautiful thing there is about you.\n\nI wouldn't be envious.\n\nSounds like she gets a lot of emotional strain from being promiscuous and having bad taste in men.\n\nYou don't want that stress in your life.\n\nJust be grateful you're not her.\n\nAnd be hopeful she lucked out with this one \n(Hope he isn't another mistake she's making).\n\nSome people think with their loins and it gets them into a boatload of trouble (I should know so, I have my moments where I let my crotch make decisions for me and it usually ends in regret or embarrassment).\n\nSo... yeah.  Just keep being yourself.  You're beautiful the way you are homie",

As I grew up, I noticed how hypocritical and almost manipulative people take the Word of God just to get what they want from someone else.\n\nNow as an adult, Im watching my childhood friend become part of the church community and actually having a perfectly/imperfect relationship. \n\nI am genuinely happy for her. I guess Im also comparing my experiences with her. I feel horrible for doing so but my mind cannot help to do it. She definitely got lucky with this guy because there are quite a few traits in him that I usually do not see in other men, which is a good thing.\n\nI just really hate these feeings that arise of envy.\n\nThank you for stating how being different is beautiful because I think Im also doing this as well. I feel like Im constantly comparing myself to her and this sh*t feels weird.\n\nBecause why am I comparing myself to her? She is not a competition, she is a friend.",

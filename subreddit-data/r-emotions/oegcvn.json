    "postText": "Hi, I'm a male and I'm 18 almost 19. I'm not too sure if this is the right sub to go to but I don't know where else to go. So I've realised lately that something isn't right with me and I'm not scared of it but I'm curious if I'm a psychopath or something like that. \n\nBasically I don't feel emotions. Like none. I don't feel empathy or sympathy for people, I don't feel sad about deaths in my family (a few have been suicides but they haven't phased me). I seem to just lack care about anything in my daily life.\n\nThe only time I feel anything is when I watch a tv show or movie. I cried in the Supernatural finale and I haven't cried in years. I had an adrenalin boost and got really excited when watching the 1st episode of Scorpion. I was happy seeing Loki fall in love with the female version of himself in the new Disney+ series 'Loki'.\n\nI'm just really unsure of what's wrong with me and I want to be able to understand it so if anybody has any answers please let me know.",

If you lack care about things in your daily life it could be your reward system is fucked. Dopamine has a lot to do with your reward system and your you could have less d2 receptors making it harder to feel rewarded. Try a dopamine detox. I\u2019m no professional and my emotional state is pretty neutral, maybe talk to a therapist if you\u2019re that concerned.",

For about two months now I've been in touch with my emotions and I feel great.\nWhat really helped me were three things. In no particular order: 1) Not spending too much time with electronics. 2) Practicing gratitude. 3) Mindfulness. \n\nI'm not sure if the first one could be fit for you, since you mentioned watching shows makes you feel emotion. \nWith the second one, the first thing I did after waking up and before going to be would be naming 5 things I was thankful for, and why. \nAnd with that last one I suggest you watch a video on it or read a book since it's an extensive topic.\n\nIf you choose to don't do any of this, that's totally fine as well. While feeling numb you can create great art and get to now yourself better.",

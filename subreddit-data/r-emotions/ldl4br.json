Growing up sucks. And I keep having dreams of my childhood and if I searched online especially YouTube, there are barely any content related to those topics \n\nAnd it sucks how if you start talking to your family or friends about missing the good ol days, they just give you a cold stare and say just accept it. Not a lot of people understand this feeling until it happens to them. Tried talking to my old friend or even new friends I made; but no one could really understand it and it didnt help how there are barely any content related to homesicknes or nostalgia to kinda make us belonged in a world so static. \n\nSo I decided to make a YouTube video on longingness.l and homesickness. Didn't plan to make a video related to this at first but after I came across a Welsh poem Hiraeth, it kinda sparked an idea and it really puts my emotions in place and make me further understand what I am feeling. \n\nFeel free to watch the video I made down below and pray to god more people make content related to homesickness (I think there are lots to talk about this particular topic).[the video I made \ud83d\udc48](https://youtu.be/VZAf-sVD0k4)",

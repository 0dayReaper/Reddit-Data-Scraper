    "postText": "As the title suggests. I\u2019ve been together with a woman for 3 years. We met in school dated throughout most of our uni life and we broke up a week ago. I haven\u2019t cried once. (I did a lot when I thought of breaking up a month before it happened) and when it did I felt relieved and free. Is this normal to feel? I do not know but the only thing I\u2019m missing is the good morning or drive safe messages which my friends and family give me enough of. Being in a long distance throughout I never missed the cuddling or the sex or the dates. It\u2019s weird but I know for a fact I don\u2019t want this woman back in my life as a friend or getting back together in a relationship. I don\u2019t know if this is acceptable or normal but I always felt I process emotions faster than normal people. And it makes me feel as tho I\u2019m toxic to some. But I genuinely don\u2019t have any unresolved emotions and it\u2019s just wiped off from me. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m even distracting myself by doing something else. I spend around an hour a day meditating and I\u2019m currently out of uni (recently graduated) and I\u2019m not doing any work or internships. I just feel blissful and it doesn\u2019t feel wrong although society makes me feel that you have to suffer Atleast 6 months until you can say you moved on from a relationship that long. Just an honest expression of my emotions. I don\u2019t have anger or sadness or regret I just feel happy and relieved about this break up and I\u2019m so content with myself right now and I\u2019m living life to my fullest and I feel more whole than I ever felt the past three years. \n\nTLDR; I don\u2019t feel sad about breakup after 3 years of dating and I feel I\u2019m okay faster than soceity suggests is normal",

Sure I'm rather skinny but I'm getting better and making sport to become more muscular than I am. But I also witnessed these reactions against muscular guys. Mostly it's by girls being disgusted at the sight of a shirtless guy, be it a skinny or muscular one, even if it is totally normal. Why is it that way?",

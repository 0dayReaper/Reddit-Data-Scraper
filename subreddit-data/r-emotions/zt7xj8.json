This is a key part of human behaviour which reassures us that we are safe and cared for. Other primates too. It\u2019s a social animal thing.    \nA long hug, lasting more than 20 seconds, causes a release of serotonin and dopamine, the happy brain/gut chemicals, which create feelings of attachment and intimacy. \n \nSelf hugging is a thing, until you find someone else, also cuddle pillows. Or a close friend who likes to hug.",

    "postText": "Hello I just wanted to get some insight on what I should do and if what I'm feeling is normal. You see recently I've been feeling very empty inside and almost deprived of love. The kind where you snuggle up with a special someone. But I'm just not sure if that's what I really want or need I just broke up with someone last July and I told myself that I would take things slow and grow and improve things with myself it been a few months and I just can't take having this gaping hole in my chest. What should I do? Is this normal? Or am I just being dumb?",

            "comment": "Yes it\u2019s normal to feel a strong desire to cuddle and hug with someone kind and caring. This is a key part of human behaviour which reassures us that we are safe and cared for. Other primates too. It\u2019s a social animal thing.    \nA long hug, lasting more than 20 seconds, causes a release of serotonin and dopamine, the happy brain/gut chemicals, which create feelings of attachment and intimacy. \n \nSelf hugging is a thing, until you find someone else, also cuddle pillows. Or a close friend who likes to hug.",

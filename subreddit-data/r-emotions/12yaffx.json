            "comment": "You feel like this because you're probably very tired of all the feelings and emotions you have. And you don't have learned and developed the knowledge, strategies and skills to manage yourself.\n\nThe peace and quiet is something you can also achief while you're alive and then you'll be actually aware of the peace and quiet.\n\nVery essential in life is knowing how to manage your body and mind... and that's the thing we don't have dedicated classes for. Learn to read your your body signs, understand what we need, understand why we stress ourselves. Understand why we as people think different and behave different.\n\nBecause we don't have classes, you either start being interested in how you function as a human and begin reading and researching and / or get therapy (which is essentially private classes to learn to understand how you work).\n\nJust sitting contemplating what the peace and quiet is like is not going to help you achief it. You have to want to understand the relationship between your experiences in life, traumas, emotions and behaviour and how it's all automated.\n\nI think this video might give you some insight:\n\n[Stress is KILLING You | This is WHY and What You Can Do | Dr. Joe Dispenza (Eye Opening Speech)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfdvbZFXbNA)\n\nOnce you are aware you can start to make changes in your life and make other decisions so you'll have peace and quiet inside.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s understandable to yearn for peace and an end to stress and pain. Life can be hard and running away is one of our two main choices.  \nHowever, if you felt just a bit more optimistic you would\u2019t consider this.   \nThe desire to live another day is strong and needs only a bit of hope to keep us going.  \nSo may I suggest some ways to introduce a bit more hope and optimism into your feelings?  \nFirstly, our emotions are physical sensations created in our abdomens by the solar plexus (the \u2018gut brain\u2019), which sends signals to the nerve endings around our internal organs.    \n\nFor example, Anxiety is a specific kind of tingle/ache in the mid point of our liver, just under our rib cage. This is why people who drink too much alcohol often suffer \u2018hangxiety\u2019 the next day (hangover anxiety). Because their liver is stressed from dealing with the alcohol, they literally have liver ache. But it feels the same as anxiety because that\u2019s where the emotion of anxiety is triggered by the solar plexus.  \n\nInterestingly it\u2019s also in almost the same place that we feel happy excitement, but that feeling is just a little further forward. Both are feelings of expectation about the near future, one anxious and bad, the other excited and good. Both felt in the liver.  \nSo if we want to change our feelings about what today or tomorrow will bring us, from being negative and uncomfortable to being optimistic and hopeful, which is what makes life enjoyable after all, despite set backs and difficulties, we need to effect change where the feelings are made and experienced.   \nWe can\u2019t avoid feelings, the whole point of them is that they dictate our choices and actions, they\u2019re about the most basic and ancient part of us, older than reason and language, but we can soothe the unpleasant feelings and encourage the good ones.  \nOur guts produce most of the dopamine and serotonin (90%) in our bodies and our gut bacteria very much affect the production of oxytocin in our brains. These three neuro chemicals are what make us feel happy and loved. And it\u2019s our guts that have a huge impact on them and our feelings.   \nSo take a good quality multi strain probiotic to make sure you\u2019re not lacking in the right gut bacteria.     \nThe gut bacteria L. reuteri is found in human breast milk and apart from increasing oxytocin production (for happy feelings) it also stimulates the immune system, improves mental health and physical healing.   \nAnd try St John\u2019s Wort tablets for 6 weeks, it inhibits the re uptake of serotonin, significantly reducing anxiety and depression.  \nAnd massage your liver regularly, circular motions under your ribcage, for a few minutes. This will soothe feelings of stress and anxiety and as you begin to feel more positive and hopeful you\u2019ll look at life in a different way.",

            "comment": "Hi OP. Thanks for positing with the courage to share this! Is it suicidal ideation? Or are you simply curious about what\u2019s on the other side?\n\nSometimes the thoughts of death are symbolic of craving finalities. If life is stressful or there are chapters of your life that you\u2019re ready to move beyond, the idea of death/rebirth or just \u2018finding our peace\u2019 with a topic can be enough to stir these thoughts up. So, I do believe it\u2019s quite normal for humans to wonder about death. But if you\u2019re contemplating suicide, please call the folks who know best. 988 in the United States. They have answers like this bc they deal with this type of Q&amp;A all day long.",

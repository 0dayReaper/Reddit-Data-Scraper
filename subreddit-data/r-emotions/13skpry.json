Intimacy is now connected to negativity and you can change your 'registry'/ego/autopilot (whatever you want to call it) that connects a situation to an emotion/feeling.\n\nLike you would comfort an abused dog, it takes time to let it know it's okay and safe in this situation. \n\nSo don't force yourself but lead yourself in a comforting way. (I just came up with this, but get intimate with yourself first and when you feel the need that your partner joins go with the flow.)\n\nDon't ever be angry at yourself for your automatic anxiety reaction. Just let it be, otherwise you create more stress hormones. Accept for now that you have this anxiety reaction and comfort yourself by telling you're safe and okay. (That's the human flaw.. the dog wouldn't be angry or sad or disappointed at it's own feelings..) Take time to reprogram yourself out of the anxiety reaction.\n\nAnd therapy is always good, learn as much about yourself as you can. It will also help you tackle other problems in life.im the future.",

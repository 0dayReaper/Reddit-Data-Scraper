But maybe the reason is that I got a job at 17 and worked, suffering from imposter syndrome due to lacking self-confidence end experience in this area. Also, I had to make myself believe that I'm enjoying my job.",

Perhaps also check with doc first if your hormonal levels are ok to see if there\u2019s a chemical balance / priority first.",

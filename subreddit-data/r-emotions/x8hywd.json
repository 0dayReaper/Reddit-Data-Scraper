    "postText": " \n\nHello.\n\nI am here because I couldn't find any reasonable explanation for my issue. I haven't felt any kind of emotion except for being angry when someone does their best to piss me off but it happens like 1-2 times a year. Also, I can feel hurt if someone says something to my face. It happens more frequently, unfortunately. The last time I felt happy was when my mother married again last year. This year I've only felt something that reminds me of the feeling of happiness 2 times, and one of them was when I communicated with my online friend. It lasted only for 3 to 5 seconds and I returned to my regular self. It feels like I started lacking emotional intelligence. When I see someone cry, I can barely feel empathy, but I understand that it would be strange if I stood right in front of them and did nothing, so I will always comfort that person because I understand how you should react at such moments. I think my heart now is made of stone. I mean, I never stopped communicating with people, I've spent a lot of time with my family on vacation. But while they felt their heart flutter at the sight of mountains and beautiful landscapes, I just had to pretend that I'm happy as well and put a smile on my face for the picture. Whenever someone sees babies, they are like \"Oh my god, he's so cute\" and in my case, it doesn't even bother me. I just see them as people.\n\nI had a thought that maybe covid had an impact on my brain neurons in that way as well because it's been 1.5 years since I got back my sense of smell and couldn't smell things normally (almost everything smells rotten or just bad; parosmia). Although I'm not a scientist, I assume there's probably some kind of connection between those neurons responsible for certain senses. Whenever someone hugs me, I can barely feel anything. It only helps if someone hurt me and I am crying. But I want to get back to my normal self, but I can't do anything about it.\n\nCan someone, who's had some kind of experience with such people or themselves tell me what it could be? I would be very grateful for your help.",

But maybe the reason is that I got a job at 17 and worked, suffering from imposter syndrome due to lacking self-confidence end experience in this area. Also, I had to make myself believe that I'm enjoying my job.",

Perhaps also check with doc first if your hormonal levels are ok to see if there\u2019s a chemical balance / priority first.",

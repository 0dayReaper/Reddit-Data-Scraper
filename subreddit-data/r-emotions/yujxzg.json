Keep moving in this direction and you\u2019ll find yourself free from this type of stress, and more able to fully embrace yourself (and others) without taking on the toxic aspects.",

You can repeat small little assurances to yourself, this is me, I am here, for example, speaking to the little one inside that wants to be seen and acknowledged. If others begin putting \u2018stuff\u2019 on you, you can also try little assurances like \u2018return to sender with compassion\u2019 which instructs the body.. almost as if to say, this isn\u2019t mine, return to sender, no drama, just imagine it bouncing off your body back to them, you can send it back with compassion or love or just truth so they receive the message in return. It allows you to be empathic or compassionate without having to take on so much. Trust that their paths will align and that you don\u2019t have to be anyone\u2019s savior or support. We all have connection to deep reserves of truth beauty and resource within ourselves, and sometimes we have to be left alone with ourselves to discover it. You can allow them that space to discover themselves. Although you may see them suffering, you don\u2019t have to interfere and at times it may be appropriate to support them through suffering. This might give you some more agency to discern what is appropriate and not. Good luck and keep us updated! \ud83d\ude4f",

As much as this helps it also seems like a bunch of garbage that someone would usually just tell me to shut up or \u201cmake me feel better\u201d and then ignore me and tell me to continue doing what I was doing. I don\u2019t mean for you to take this the wrong way I think it\u2019s just after having been \u201chelped\u201d by so many people with things by addressing emotional concerns it all seems like a fat stinky load of cow shit that people toss out for you to get you to shut up so you can ignore them.",

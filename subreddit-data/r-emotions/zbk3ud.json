It\u2019s a good idea in a safe place, and the good thing is online, there are options for safe communities, although there\u2019s obviously a range and some def aren\u2019t great. This isn\u2019t a very active community so maybe you\u2019ll find more support from another option. Being a minor, do you have the support of a parent or guardian to help you find one that\u2019s a good fit?",

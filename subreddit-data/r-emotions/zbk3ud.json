    "postText": "It is not an story actually, just that lately (I think for like 3 months now) I have been feeling awful and I don't have anybody to talk to about it. At max for half an hour I feel energetic, willing to sth, or motivated etc. Then, my state of mind shifts and I don't feel like doing anything, I just want to sleep or wish for the day to be over. I have 0 motivation for most of the time and I don't know how to change this. \nI am fairly new to reddit so I generally do not post in case I do it the wrong way, but right now I need to talk and there is no one that I can talk about this. Probably no one is going to read this here anyways but this way I feel heard compared to talking inside my head.",

It\u2019s a good idea in a safe place, and the good thing is online, there are options for safe communities, although there\u2019s obviously a range and some def aren\u2019t great. This isn\u2019t a very active community so maybe you\u2019ll find more support from another option. Being a minor, do you have the support of a parent or guardian to help you find one that\u2019s a good fit?",

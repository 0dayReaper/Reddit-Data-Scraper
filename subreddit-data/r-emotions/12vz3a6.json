            "comment": "You don't need to burn or fight your emotions, they will not go away as long as you don't fix the 'problem' from where it originates.\n\nKeep on observing your feelings and emotions. You described them very good. Never be be afraid or angry at having them, they are part of being a living being.\n\nThere are 2 processes I check:\n\n- Are the feelings from my body like does it need something, rest, food, water, exercise, security, safety, love, etc.\n- Are the feelings from my thoughts (usually some traumatic event that is triggered) that create negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nWhen we're already stressed because our needs are not fulfilled, our thoughts and emotions of fear, anger, sadness get louder and in more control. That's a normal response of the whole fight and flight system. Our lifes are too stressfull in this modern world so we often don't get back into default recovery mode. We keep on making the stress hormone cortisol by thinking negative about ourselves, others and situations (past, present and future).\n\nWhat we need to learn, but often don't at a young age, is understand why we have feelings and emotions and what we have to do to solve the problem the feelings and emotions are hinting at. We need to learn the language of our body and learn the skills to have more control over our lifes.\n\nThere are two video's I think that might give you more insight:\n\n- [The Space Between Self-Esteem and Self Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvtZBUSplr4)\n- [Stress is KILLING You | This is WHY and What You Can Do ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfdvbZFXbNA)",

It's way cheaper than the in person ones. I just did the one in March and it totally transformed my life. \n\nHe also does free challenges once or twice per year. Not sure when the next one might be. But these are only like 2-3 hours per day and don't go as deep. Still helpful but only a start. \n\nGood luck!",

I read your post a few times and will think about ways I can first understand more context about your experience and second, hopefully recommend some insightful resources. That said, this isn\u2019t medical advice and if you\u2019re dealing with complex trauma, there is hope. Understandable that one session per week may not be enough AND you have to be sure to have the right support. Is your therapist trained in complex trauma and PTSD?",

I'd had a conversation with my FWBs main side (don't remember if I mentioned she's poly) who explained his rules for everything which I'm ok with. No medication,  prescribed or otherwise. I'll admit I've been consuming more beer than before, but I will not drive if I've had any, so completely sober. \n\nI'll give more info if requested, I'm just emotionally and mentally fried after today so idk what else to say.",

For what it\u2019s worth, I witness your struggle and thank you for showing up. You wouldn\u2019t have written if you weren\u2019t seeking solutions so that\u2019s actually a big step in the right direction. I\u2019m helping a friend go through therapy and she found 3x week best for the first six months. Now she\u2019s able to balance through the week enough to get it weekly meetings. She couldn\u2019t afford to keep 2x or 3x going so she also did a lot of self work on stability. Justin Senseri has some great material. But I\u2019m not sure who else to recommend in this space. Will think about it and write again if I come up with something.",

These are the hardest to change but it\u2019s not impossible.",

My genetics are a bit against me with my brother, father and uncle all having various mental health issues, my childhood had a specific dysfunction within the household as well. These combine to make my personality stricter quite introverted and neurotic. I also might be autistic which I\u2019m currently in the diagnosis process for. The part about changing these things is what i \u2018cant\u2019 do.",

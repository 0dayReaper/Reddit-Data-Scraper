    "postText": "I feel sick to my stomach from anxiety, I lay restless breaking into sweats about having to face the next day of my terrible decisions I tried my best on. I\u2019m not good enough to be alive, I\u2019m not good enough to fill the role of being a person, I even try at trying but fail at that. Why do I try so hard but falter so often? There isn\u2019t a secret answer or set of steps on how to fix myself it just is and always will be how it is, inadequacy on every level, it doesn\u2019t matter what aspect you look at i fail. I can only apologise and try again so many times before enough is enough and you have to admit I\u2019m a broken machine. I can only hear so many times I\u2019m \u2018good enough\u2019 or the things I\u2019m saying to myself arnt true by people who know me less than I know them and by people who after a little while will see what I really am. I\u2019m unfixable. I can\u2019t just exist while being broken so what else can I do? I don\u2019t want to exist, I don\u2019t want to commit suicide, but I don\u2019t want the person I am to exist. The person I am and always will be, I am fundamentally wrong in concept and execution but there is no starting again or fixes. I am cursed until my end, whenever that me be. The sooner the better.",

These are the hardest to change but it\u2019s not impossible.",

My genetics are a bit against me with my brother, father and uncle all having various mental health issues, my childhood had a specific dysfunction within the household as well. These combine to make my personality stricter quite introverted and neurotic. I also might be autistic which I\u2019m currently in the diagnosis process for. The part about changing these things is what i \u2018cant\u2019 do.",

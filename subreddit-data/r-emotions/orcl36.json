    "postText": "I grew up in an environment where all my feelings were suppressed and restricted. I couldn\u2019t not show joy, sadness or anger. Most of my emotions were not accepted by my parents. I had to show respect and politeness. I\u2019m now 27 years old and cannot show emotions pretty well or if they showed, they\u2019re out of control. Like anger.\n\nI\u2019m going through therapy for depression and anxiety, and the quality of my thoughts are always negative, so most of the emotions I have now (or that my body language shows) are negative. I feel that I am not connected to my feelings at all and I cannot control the way I feel.",

(A good book I used is The 6 minutes dairy. It has a good explaination how it works.)\n\nThe other thing to practice is the body and mind connection with Yoga or Thai Chi. And try theater / acting. Just stand in front of the mirror and practice being angry, sad, surprised. You're body needs to get used to the fact it's okay to do express emotions. Dance in your room on different kinds of music (from soft to agressive music).\n\nLook up emotional expression on Youtube.\n\nGood luck on your journey!",

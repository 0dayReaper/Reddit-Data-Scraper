    "postText": "About a year ago, I stopped feeling emotions. Now, I say that but in reality, it was only happiness that I stopped feeling. Now I feel nothing, no stress, no sadness, and only a miniscule amount of anger. Let me explain.\nIn September 2021 I started feeling more and more anxious. I was 14 at the time, and in 9th grade (in American numbers) and it was the start of school. This puts me in a bad position, because quarantine had just stopped and school was in-person again. This leads to why (I think) I stopped feeling emotions. I had never taken any serious exams due to any classes before quarantine not requiring them (in my country you don't take exams before 7th grade) and I was a really anxious person, like to the point where I was stressed about the smallest things, so naturally, the wave of seemingly endless tests that would come my way would force me into panic mode. I peaked at my heart being over 210 BPM one day and it was not uncommon to see it peak over 170 for every day for a 2-3 month span. Another reason why I think this happened is because in the summer time before school I decided to do a lot of all-nighters and generally not sleep well (7 hours on a good day) and those habits were carried over to school too. It was common to see me at school with only about 5 hours of sleep. Thing is though, when I started losing my emotions due to those two factors, it was only my happiness that was lost really, and it wasn't even lost entirely. I could still feel sadness, stress and anger. Letting out my feelings felt good, and so did crying (now it just gives me a funny feeling in my head). I should also mention how before all of this happened, the time period between mid-late 2019 and late 2020 was the best time of my life. I was super happy every day, I was getting really good sleep, I was very emotionally stable, I had found a new friend group, and everything felt so fresh, like, every night I'd look at the night sky, smile and feel happy about every day, I'd feel grateful and proud of everything I achieved. Before 2019 I was a social outcast, with zero real friendships, so you could see why that was. During mid 2021 and all the way until September I was still in a good spot mentally, I had found a new friend group and we played every day, in addition, YouTube content creation really interested me too, and I started livestreaming. The gods were on my side since in little to no time I started building up a community and met some really cool people. So you can see how in contrast to what my emotion is now, in earlier times I was over the moon. Now I sit in my bed, think about the past, I can't be sad about it. I understand that I can't feel emotions, they seem locked away from me, somewhere in my brain where I can't access them because I don't have the key. I can't feel sadness for losing my emotions even though I want to. It's so bad it has layers now. I genuinely feel like the biggest tragedy could happen to me right now and I wouldn't feel anything. That is all. If you have made it this far I genuinely want to thank you because this sub is so small and the willingness for strangers to read like a 2000 word long essay by some stranger about his emotions is even smaller.",

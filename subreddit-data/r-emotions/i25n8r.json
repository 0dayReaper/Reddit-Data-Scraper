This could be a parent or other person telling you outright that being angry means you are a bad person/silly/worthless/whatever. Or it could be something you picked up from how everyone treated anger. If it is the latter, the work is to learn how to feel both things - remain angry (if you are) and also feel the hurt. But every time remember that it's OK to feel angry, anger is OK to feel. Remember you don't have to express a feeling to the person causing it, you can 'save it for later' and let the feeling out when you're alone.",

I think it's because when someone calls you angry, sometimes it is just an indicator that they aren't resonating with your point of view of the situation and to say 'wow youre so angry' is kinda dismissive of the way you might be feeling. Just remember that to be calm is an act of self love and such a flex in the face of those who don't listen.",

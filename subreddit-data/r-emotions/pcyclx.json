    "postText": "What if I died, right now, laying on the couch with nobody home? Nobody would know for a couple days until my family got home from camp, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have missed phone calls and unanswered text messages, but that\u2019s not too unusual, and probably wouldn\u2019t arouse too much suspicion. Dishes half done, floors not vacuumed, alone, nobody to hold every night, not anymore. I lost my license again, car is impounded for 2 weeks, I\u2019m stuck relying on other people to drive me places because I can\u2019t watch my speed, I just keep fucking up, and just as things are starting to look up again, too. I would never end my own life, I care too much for the people I do have in it, but it would be a complete lie if I said I never thought about it. Wouldn\u2019t have to worry about my future anymore, or my past, although that\u2019s what determines where I go when I die, if there even is a place. I do believe I would go to heaven, I\u2019m a kind person, I rarely put myself first, at least in my own eyes. I love being alone, it gives me the time to think, and to feel, even on gloomy, rainy days where my emotions are less than happy ones, but I also miss people, I miss having someone I could lay my head on in silence, I miss all the memories, and feeling happy, even though looking back it was just boredom masking itself as happiness, it was still resemblant to true happiness. I have found happiness again in the form of Emily, I obviously miss everything I had with Hailey, so much, but I\u2019m not sure I miss her, herself, only the benefits. I\u2019m actually connecting with Emily, it feels more real, although very early and there are no labels, it feels more real than what I had before, regardless of time. It was as if I was scared to let go, only because of how much of my time was invested in the relationship. I don\u2019t know how I feel, why do I always feel numb when I\u2019m alone? Am I truly happy? Am I just sad? Is this normal? I\u2019ve always felt this way, as far back as I can remember, so it\u2019s more than likely the way anyone else feels when they\u2019re alone, just kinda empty.",

            "comment": "You need to work on self empathy and recognizing your own needs\u2026 what needs are you not caring for? What needs of yours are not being met? And then make peace with those needs, the part of you that neglected them, and how with you no longer neglect them. And what needs you need to communicate to others, clearly and with empathy. \n\nOnly you control how you feel.  Only you control your actions.  Make a list of the actions you choose to do, everything is a choice at base.  \nChoose to do things and think what need(s) drive that choice.  Embrace your needs, do them with gusto for your needs.  \n\nThe only thing you know is real is the here and now. Make the most of it.  You should check out NVC, Dr. Marshall Rosenberg",

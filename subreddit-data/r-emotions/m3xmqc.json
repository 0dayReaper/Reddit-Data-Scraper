    "postText": "Many moons have passed. I\u2019ve been awaiting the day when the bright light of freedom shines through the darkness I am lost in. Today, was that day. \n\nMy preparedness lacked, but I found the tools and souls to guide me through a tumultuous jungle of terrifying uncertainty. I reminisce on the person I sought out to be and realize that oppression of self causes more chaos; and conforming cannot be an option, any longer. \n\nI am a warrior. The battles have been fierce, and I\u2019ve many wounds to show for it. I felt defeated, confused, and haunted by failure. A shoe that would surely drop, sooner or later. And then, it got a little lighter. Not a lot, but enough to know the difference. A flicker of hope that, soon enough, I will be free. It seems so far away, but I can finally see it.\n\nAll of a sudden, my scars are more beautiful, marks of survival. Representing the strength I carry inside me. Strength I swore did not exist. And yet here I am. \n\nThe light of freedom gives me hope. I thought I had lost it all. \n\n\nDedicated to my tribe, who kept me going when I didn\u2019t think I could.",

When this happens my head starts to almost pound and I start to get really nauseous. Does anyone have an idea on why? (I\u2019m also 14 if that helps anything.)",

You probably have reasons for not wanting to show your emotions to your family, but it will be really helpful to let them out when you're alone. Make space for your self to feel angry and sad and all the other things. You may feel many things about one event. That's normal. You can also feel things about your family and still love them. But you loving them and them loving you isn't an excuse for them to treat you badly.   \n\n\nWhen you're trying to feel a feeling when you're alone you can start by saying the words out loud that you would have said when you were with the people. Then when the feeling comes you can yell and cry and shake. you're letting physical energy our of your body, and the more you use your body and voice the more will be expressed. It's hard, it's uncomfortable, but you can do it.",

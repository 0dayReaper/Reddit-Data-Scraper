Your observation doesn\u2019t seem consistent with the extreme levels of burnout that\u2019s prevalent in society today. \n\nWhy keep achieving goals if there is no accompanying signal or it doesn\u2019t cultivate the creation/frequency of a signal? What even is your definition of \u201cactual goal\u201d?",

Luck does not have to be a emotion only trigged by achieving a goal. It can be mostly consistent, but never by pushing away other emotions.\n\nThe key is accepting and leting go.\nLeave, love or change it.\n\nSince meditating I feel much more connected to myself.",

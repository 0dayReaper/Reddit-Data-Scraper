    "postText": "in the last 2 years i relised i have a huge hatred towards other people family,friends and other people. they dissapoint me they dont keep their promises and they are always right and they are always victims. In the last few weeks i started thinking about all my experiences towards  this point in life and i just want to drop a bomb on every single person my eyes meet. im stoic usually but goddammit i just cant stand people. if anything brings me feeling of hatred its being in a earshot of other people. i dont want to change with this feeling of mine because i changed a lot pshicaly and menatly. i came to went and i want to hear somebodys opinion on this. fuck everybody in my 2000000 radius. english is bad and i know it, its improving every day. thanks.",

The only shame i have felt in my entire life was realising that i have to eat shit and piss with the same organisms that are putting limits on me which i have to break. Thank god my little self knew it would come to this. Just a year more and im out of here. A good job that is going to be something i always wanted to do which needs me to leave this fucking place. I cant do shit as i am now but there is a saying that not all hope is lost. Strive for more and dont let anybody take you down. Its been my motto for past few years and to anybody who is feeling like shit should take in mind. The biggest obstical to your succses is yourself. Everbody else can be delt with in a small time frame by any means. Thanks for reading and i hope that people in the same situation can make good of themselves. Stay strong brothers and sisters.",

There\u2019s room for you to feel this way and there\u2019s a safe space here to be with the experience. It sounds like you have hope at the end of the tunnel here which is good to hear. Don\u2019t forget life can also be miraculous in ways and humans can be so very nice to be with. My\nIntention for you is only to experience better. Don\u2019t forget that there\u2019s always support available, that your perspective and what you do matters and that hurting someone (yourself or others) is never the best option. Stay strong as well and thank you for showing up and speaking your mind.",

    "postText": "so my dad decided to get a citroen ds7 automatic (he's already had it for a month and a half) and put his citroen ds5 manual up for sale back at the beggining of july and he did receive a couple of calls from people interested in it, but they all decided to eventually give up on it. meanwhile, i was finishing my driving lessons, and 8 days ago i passed my driving test first try. yesterday, my dad drove his ds5 over to some place where he thought the car would get more attention, i was quite sad and cried because i had always dreamed of driving that car. it's such a unique, fashionable car that no one had, so underrated, special- really suits my father who is special too, and since i relate and look up to him a lot, it happened to somehow mean to me too. today i woke up to seeing the car out of my window, where it always was. i was surprised and actually very happy to see it again... but i wasn't sure why he'd driven it back to our place. i was excited because tomorrow i'd be picking my license up and will finally be able to drive all of our (current) 3 cars. or that's what i thought. just a few moments ago i heard my dad tell my mom that he's having someone see it and potentially buy it tomorrow. that made me so angry in a way and made me go to my room and cry about it while writing this stupid reddit post. i can't express how sad it makes me feel, that tomorrow i'm getting my license and that he's also selling it tomorrow. that means i won't have a chance to ever drive it. i was praying he wouldn't sell it till i get my license but oh well, looks like he is. maybe these feelings are just foolish but  i don't know...",

            "comment": "Doesn\u2019t seem foolish or unreasonable at all. I remember dreaming of driving my dads sports car but same story, he sold the nicest car he ever had before I got my license and I drove a small $500 junker car to school, which was embarrassing. To me, it was symbolic of my relationship w my dad bc we shared memories driving to spend time in the sports car (which was rare). Of course it would\u2019ve been nice to show up to school in a nicer car to be proud of too! Did you try talking to your dad and explaining your connection to the car? Maybe he reconsiders or at least appreciates you thinking that way.",

                    "comment": "Aw man. It sucks that you had to go through that too. Sadly, my dad already sold it, about 12 hours after I made this post. Yeah, I did get my drivers license a moment before he sold it. And it hurt like hell, I cried again and all that. Thing is, reason why I never mentioned the connection to him is because in my country there\u2019s driving limitations. You can drive from age 17 - and it\u2019s only cars up to 80kw (107hp) and with supervision from a person who\u2019s had their license for 5+ years. From 18 until 21, you can drive on your own, but it can still only be an up to 80kw car. Also you\u2019re forced to have 2 stickers on your car to label you as a beginner driver. However, you can drive a bigger, proper car as well, from 17 to 21 only with supervision of a family member. Well, me being 17, I thought that since I needed supervision anyway whichever one of our cars I drove in, I thought he might keep it but nah. Minutes before he sold it I reminded him that I am eligible of driving both his DS5 and DS7 but with  him or mom and he was like \u201cNo way, really?\u201d. So yeah, we kinda barely discussed it before but I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve changed anything. I actually drove our tiny Fiat 500 that was left for me (despite being my mom\u2019s car) and it was ok enough but I wish the commands were smoother.",

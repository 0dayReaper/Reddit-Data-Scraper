I remember dreaming of driving my dads sports car but same story, he sold the nicest car he ever had before I got my license and I drove a small $500 junker car to school, which was embarrassing. To me, it was symbolic of my relationship w my dad bc we shared memories driving to spend time in the sports car (which was rare). Of course it would\u2019ve been nice to show up to school in a nicer car to be proud of too! Did you try talking to your dad and explaining your connection to the car? Maybe he reconsiders or at least appreciates you thinking that way.",

                    "comment": "Aw man. It sucks that you had to go through that too. Sadly, my dad already sold it, about 12 hours after I made this post. Yeah, I did get my drivers license a moment before he sold it. And it hurt like hell, I cried again and all that. Thing is, reason why I never mentioned the connection to him is because in my country there\u2019s driving limitations. You can drive from age 17 - and it\u2019s only cars up to 80kw (107hp) and with supervision from a person who\u2019s had their license for 5+ years. From 18 until 21, you can drive on your own, but it can still only be an up to 80kw car. Also you\u2019re forced to have 2 stickers on your car to label you as a beginner driver. However, you can drive a bigger, proper car as well, from 17 to 21 only with supervision of a family member. Well, me being 17, I thought that since I needed supervision anyway whichever one of our cars I drove in, I thought he might keep it but nah. Minutes before he sold it I reminded him that I am eligible of driving both his DS5 and DS7 but with  him or mom and he was like \u201cNo way, really?\u201d. So yeah, we kinda barely discussed it before but I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve changed anything. I actually drove our tiny Fiat 500 that was left for me (despite being my mom\u2019s car) and it was ok enough but I wish the commands were smoother.",

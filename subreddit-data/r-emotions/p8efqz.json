And accept the error ! And u will feel better ! \n\nCourage !",

The signals are made by part of your brain called the limbic system.\n\nThe limbic system is also called the caveman brain. So it takes care of our survival. The limbic system knows survival is best in a group.\n\nThe limbic system keeps track of all your values (the way you should behave in a group to survive) and your beliefs (information that keeps you safe, for example: If I tell you a berry is poisonous, you have to belief it. You can not try the berry.)\n\nDuring all the years you have lived, you learned about different values and beliefs. You have a certain view of yourself, who you want to be as a person.\n\nWhen we, yes all people in the world, do or think things that are not according to our values and beliefs we feel emotions. When we see things happening in the world that's not according to our values an beliefs, we feel emotions too.\n\nThe thing is, you have done things that you feel guilty about. This is because you know you didn't follow the group rules (values). This way your limbic system is giving you a warning to not ever do that again. It wants to make sure, so you are hereby warned with the feeling of guild.\n\nYou will think twice now to repeat...\n\nAfter a while when you don't think about it, your guild will fade. You'll experience new things that will keep your mind busy.\n\nThe afraid emotion is also a warning. You feel you endangered your relationship with your parents. You need your parents for survival. So.. yeah, it's logical you're afraid.\n\nBut, did you learn from all this? Why did you do something against your values? Was it because of the way people look at you or think about you?\n\nIf you've got wise parents talk to them. Talk about what you did, how it made you feel, what were the consequenses and what you learned from it. We all need to vent our feelings and try to understand how we can better our lifes.\n\nYou probably know better if your parents are getting angry (just angry because they are surprised by your behaviour and want you to do the correct thing) or angry (and mistreating you physically and/or mentally).\n\nThe first one... that's okay... that's normal. After a talk balance will return. If the last... talk to someone you trust.\n\nEdit: Watch this [How to master and control your emotions](https://youtu.be/hYZmK46--Mc), it gave me insight about my emotions. The filter he is talking about are your values and beliefs.",

Some things went \u201cwrong\u201d in some of my relationships along the way and it was almost like a reflex for me to completely shut down and go back to total denial and apathy. It was weird because I knew that I wasn\u2019t inherently this way so I would have talks with myself for months about how I need to \u201cturn back on\u201d but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t. It took about six months for me to get back to a place where I could acknowledge my feelings again and actually feel them. \n\nMy best advice: let yourself feel everything, good and bad. Document those feelings in a way that you enjoy (don\u2019t make it into a chore). Find someone that you can vent to and commit to venting to them. Eventually, let them speak openly about your patterns to you. A mentor that can \u201ccall you out\u201d has been an extraordinarily helpful resource for me. \n\nI hope this helps a little.",

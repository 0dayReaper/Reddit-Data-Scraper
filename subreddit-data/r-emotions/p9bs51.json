Pursue the \u2018good\u2019 things and fight or escape the \u2018bad\u2019 things.  \nSince \u2018needing the bathroom\u2019 is a normal digestive function in itself and neither good nor bad but neutral, it is not an emotion.  \nSimilarly even crying and laughing are not emotions, but they may be side effects of our emotional state (how we feel, good or bad.)",

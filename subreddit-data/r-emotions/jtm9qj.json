I apply a lot of pressure on myself and don\u2019t take time to appreciate my hard work and effort. I think it\u2019s because I try to be perfect and I need to work on that too. I just have a lot of unlearning and self growth to do.",

Judgement before a while cuz im a very vibrant person and very open minded when it comes to things like my sexuality  for example being a pansexual boy in a community that has the standard of guys gotta be tough and rough i always felt like id be seen as weak for liking boys just as much as girls but as I built my confidence I started being very open and at first I was called a faggot and a pussy now those same people called me  names they learned to respect me and I learned that my masculinity isn't based on who I love but just my ability to be myself",

I feared that they would judge me and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always strived to be perfect. I didn\u2019t want anyone to find a reason to judge me. It was just a very bad and toxic mindset, and I honestly think this is why I struggle with confidence. But also the fact that kids use to be homophobic towards you actually gets in my nerves, I am glad that they\u2019ve learned. Let me know if anyone says something mean, I\u2019ll be there in 2seconds",

Right now I\u2019m struggling in my math class and I just want to cry. Next year I\u2019m supposed to be taking calculus and chemistry, but to take those classes, I need to pass pre-cal/trig with a C or higher. I'm usually really good at math, but that\u2019s because it's in class and I can ask all the dumb questions I have. I love to verify that I\u2019m doing my math correctly and that I have a clear understanding. With math being online it\u2019s just harder. Online and in-person classes are two completely different environments. I feel like I\u2019m gonna fail the class and I\u2019m so scared. I'm currently going to community college, because it was just a safer option with COVID, and I don\u2019t want to prolong my transfer. My goal was to only do two years, so I can transfer and finish my last two year at any university, and I don\u2019t see it happening \ud83d\ude2a. I think I put too much pressure on myself, and sometimes I\u2019m the reason why I get sad. \n\nThis week had to be one of my worst weeks ever. I had a bio quiz, and I usually do good, but I got a 13/20\ud83d\ude10. Yesterday I had math hw due, and I didn\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m passing all my other classes but I\u2019m so behind because I\u2019m so focused on my general Ed classes. I\u2019m so exhausted and overwhelmed. On top of that staying at home is too much for me. Before all this happened, I didn\u2019t go out as much but I still made sure I didn\u2019t stay in the house 24/7. I plan on talking to one of my professors and ranting about this whole situation. \n\nI know that I put a lot of pressure on myself but it\u2019s only because, in high school I was more chill about school. I still made sure I passed, and didn\u2019t fail any classes, but I was super chill in school.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m overreacting, but this is how I feel and it sucks. There\u2019s just so many things affecting me that idk how to deal with it all at once. Idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, I\u2019ll probably feel worse after my exam, but all I can try to do is stay positive and hope for the best \ud83d\ude13\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude23",

I apply a lot of pressure on myself and don\u2019t take time to appreciate my hard work and effort. I think it\u2019s because I try to be perfect and I need to work on that too. I just have a lot of unlearning and self growth to do.",

Judgement before a while cuz im a very vibrant person and very open minded when it comes to things like my sexuality  for example being a pansexual boy in a community that has the standard of guys gotta be tough and rough i always felt like id be seen as weak for liking boys just as much as girls but as I built my confidence I started being very open and at first I was called a faggot and a pussy now those same people called me  names they learned to respect me and I learned that my masculinity isn't based on who I love but just my ability to be myself",

I feared that they would judge me and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always strived to be perfect. I didn\u2019t want anyone to find a reason to judge me. It was just a very bad and toxic mindset, and I honestly think this is why I struggle with confidence. But also the fact that kids use to be homophobic towards you actually gets in my nerves, I am glad that they\u2019ve learned. Let me know if anyone says something mean, I\u2019ll be there in 2seconds",

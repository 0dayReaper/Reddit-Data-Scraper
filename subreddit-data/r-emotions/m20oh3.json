    "postText": "The past year, everything in life has changed, especially with the pandemic. The company I work for has become something I no longer want to be apart of. I have been working with my crew being understaffed, under appreciated, and it has broken me inside. \n\nI put my two week notice in, and been looking for a new job for weeks before that. And yet, I still cry on my way to work every single day. What if I don\u2019t get a job? But what if I stay and spiral even more out of control? \n\nI am terrified for what is to come, but afraid to talk about it because I don\u2019t want to manifest negative thoughts and have them become real. Anyone I have talked to always reminds me how amazing I am and how my hard work will speak for itself, but I am scared. The fear keeps me from having a real happiness. I feel like I have to wear a mask (under my literal mask) and it hurts like hell.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m asking from an online community, but if anyone out there has had an experience similar to what I\u2019m going through, I would be so grateful for some insight.",

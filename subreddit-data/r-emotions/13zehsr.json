Unsolicited advice for a big open trip that may be emotionally challenging is to decide on what your North Star is gonna be. Choose a singular goal that motivates you in all aspects (fam, career, ++) and make that your mantra. Most people need to work for something bigger than themselves in order to stay on track for this length of time (without the physical support and contact of their immediate team.) Zoom often. Work hard and lots of luck!!",

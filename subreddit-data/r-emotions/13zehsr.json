    "postText": "I\u2019m leaving and going across the country for a few months. I found a really good opportunity that will make me a lot of money and set me up with experience in my field so that I can get an even better job than the one I\u2019m leaving for. I will be away from my family and my significant other for at least 3 months and up to 7 months. The feelings didn\u2019t hit me until I\u2019m sitting here at this gate waiting for my plane to board. I\u2019m so happy I got this opportunity but the reality of it is that it is a dangerous position to work in. I\u2019m going to miss everyone so much and can\u2019t wait to get back and give everyone hugs and kisses.",

Unsolicited advice for a big open trip that may be emotionally challenging is to decide on what your North Star is gonna be. Choose a singular goal that motivates you in all aspects (fam, career, ++) and make that your mantra. Most people need to work for something bigger than themselves in order to stay on track for this length of time (without the physical support and contact of their immediate team.) Zoom often. Work hard and lots of luck!!",

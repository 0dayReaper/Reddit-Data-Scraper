    "postText": "I noticed years ago that if I asked any kid if being mad was bad they all said yes. This is why I\u2019m trying to spread word about my book series called No Bad Feelings. I created a whole series about emotions and how they are healthy! It answers questions like what are emotions, why do we have them, where do they come from, how do they help me, and what do I do with them! Thanks for letting me share. Just want kids to know feelings aren\u2019t the enemy.",

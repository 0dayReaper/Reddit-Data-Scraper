    "postText": "So today, we were playing football in PE. At first I was qb and i was doing good but my teammates made me swap to WR even tho i was team captain. I was annoyed but did it anyway. Then while I was wide receiver, the guy playing quarterback saw me (i had nobody within 20 feet of me) and threw it to someone with 5 guys on her, it was intercepted. I left the field out of pure anger and as they begged me not to leave I left in tears. Am i justified about this or am i being petty?",

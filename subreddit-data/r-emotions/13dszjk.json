    "postText": "(F19)I'm asking because since I've been a child, I always seem to cry on my birthdays. My birthdays are usually quite nice, I used to have a party with my friends/family, have a cake, presents and a good meal. I had kind of deduced that these crying moments happened because of the combined excitement and pressure to have fun, a lot of stimuli can be a bit much and that was just my body's way of releasing all the bottled up energy. \nHowever now that I'm older, I won't necessarily have such a big celebration but i still seem to get sad on my these special days.\nIt's my 19th birthday today and I just feel kinda sad.\nI'm in uni now but was at my parents this weekend so we had a prebirthday meal and cake, and my best friend is in class right now but we had a meal yesterday so I'm not really sure why I'm feeling sad like this.\nI feel like these last bdays have flown by, I hardly saw 18 pass that I'm already 19 ! It's a bit scary and while I'm excited about this new age, i feel as if time is just slipping through my fingers faster than before, months pass by so quickly! \nI don't feel like celebrating as much anymore either, I haven't organised anything for tonight, but my week is already planned with other social events.\nDoes anybody else get this ? I feel kind of guilty for feeling miserable on a day where I should be happy",

Yeah I totally get that I think it\u2019s a common feeling for many people it\u2019s just a human thing I guess we put lots of importance in age and sometimes it just means more pressure so it\u2019s a lot to process I guess \nSometimes it\u2019s just nostalgia or change, pretty normal\nTry not to feel guilty about it you\u2019re allowed to feel this",

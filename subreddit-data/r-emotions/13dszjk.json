Yeah I totally get that I think it\u2019s a common feeling for many people it\u2019s just a human thing I guess we put lots of importance in age and sometimes it just means more pressure so it\u2019s a lot to process I guess \nSometimes it\u2019s just nostalgia or change, pretty normal\nTry not to feel guilty about it you\u2019re allowed to feel this",

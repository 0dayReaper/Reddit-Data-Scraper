As a therapist, I understand how frustrating it can be to let yourself get excited and then have to be let down. But it is crucial for our own well-being to let ourselves be grateful for anything we can be. Here's a small exercise that might help:\n\nEveryday, write down 3 things you are grateful for. It can be anything, even the littlest thing that brought you a moment of peace or joy.\n\nFor example, today, I am grateful for:\n\n1. The cup of coffee I had in the garden this morning - it gave me 5 minutes of peace to begin my day with.  \n\n2. My little brother who never fails to do ridiculous dance moves that make me laugh\n\n3. My colleague who took over a work call so I could take a 15 minute break!\n\nIf you're artistic you can draw as well, whatever works. Having this down on paper often helps solidify the fact that there are things to be happy about, even if they are small and fleeting and that can make the day a little bit better:)\n\nIf you need any support please feel free to reach out!",

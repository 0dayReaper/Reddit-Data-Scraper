I was looking at my phone wanting her to tell me what i needed to here.shes been asleep for 2 hours now. And at that exact moment my phone went off with a text \u201cI love you so much and your the best\u201d and i started crying. It felt so weird. Like something made this happen at that very moment. Idk if this makes sense but even know I feel deeply connected. \n\nPlease help me describe this feeling. I need to know what it is. It feels like more than love as corny as that sounds.",

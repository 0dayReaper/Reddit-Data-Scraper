If your work is sufficiently fulfilling in itself it\u2019s certainly possible to work and sleep and repeat whilst feeling happy and purposeful, but most people\u2019s work is not like that. Time off for fun is important, but if it feels like \u2018time wasting\u2019 perhaps replace some of the more \u2018indulgent\u2019 leisure with something that benefits you and feels worthwhile, like exercise.",

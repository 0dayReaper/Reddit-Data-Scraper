    "postText": "Is it possible for one to only either work or rest, without having any fun? By fun, I mean binge watching movies and other less meaningful forms of self indulgence. Because I feel that having \"fun\" discourages me from doing what needs to be done but at the same time I'm kind of worried that constantly suppressing these urges to have \"fun\" would be detrimental to my emotional wellness as I will either be thinking about work or I would just be bored when I'm not allowed to do anything \"fun\" when I'm resting.\n\n\nAny feedback will be very much appreciated!!",

If your work is sufficiently fulfilling in itself it\u2019s certainly possible to work and sleep and repeat whilst feeling happy and purposeful, but most people\u2019s work is not like that. Time off for fun is important, but if it feels like \u2018time wasting\u2019 perhaps replace some of the more \u2018indulgent\u2019 leisure with something that benefits you and feels worthwhile, like exercise.",

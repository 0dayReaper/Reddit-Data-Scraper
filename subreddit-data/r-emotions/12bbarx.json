    "postText": "It\u2019s been a while since I can feel any emotions. I\u2019m not sayin I\u2019m a psycho or anything, but I feel like I have issues feeling emotions that I could feel as a kid. When I was young, I used to be able to feel all different types of emotions. I could empathize with others. I could feel sad when someone else is sad. I felt excited when others was excited. Now I can barely feel any significant emotion other than discomfort or anxiety. I really wish I am able to experience this world the way young me could. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with me. Any suggestions?",

            "comment": "most emotions arise from a difference between personal experiences and personal expectations/desires... a rational, vulcan like, logical individual will not experience emotions typical to the masses... the only ones that will come strongly will be things like hunger, thirst, fear(which is rational expectation of pain in many instances).  Perhaps you are simply more rational and logical than most?\n\nI had a brother who never saw eye to eye with me, was never anyone I would even think of as a friend, yet when he died I cried several times until I realized that the source was the reasonable but false expectation of permanence that comes with close family... when someone is yanked away by death that expectation is shattered and does not give much warning it even exists... but once digging into my reason for crying and discovering this, I have not cried since.",

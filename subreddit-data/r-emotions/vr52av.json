    "postText": "[Academic] Survey on Color and Emotion Psychology (Everyone) \n\nhttps://campus.lamapoll.de/Colors-and-Emotions \n\nAs part of my bachelor thesis, I deal with emotion psychological aspects in interaction with colors. \n\nThis survey will take 3-5 minutes and is anonymous. \n\nYou will be asked two demographic questions at the end just for statistic purposes (gender and age group). But you can skip them, as you can also skip every other question. \n\nI'm looking forward for every participant. \n\nPlease let me know if they are unclear words or grammar mistakes in general, as you may have realised that English isn't my mother tongue. \n\nThanks a lot!",

            "comment": "What color is associated with a particular emotion? \n\nAlthough there have been various studies on this in the past, the whole thing would be put to the test again and also interrogate emotional states, which rather have no clear, collectively true-genomic color assignment. \n\nIn addition, it would be interesting to find out how emotion classifications can be related to color systems. (For example, is emotion A. associated with blue, and emotion B. associated with yellow? And also becomes emotion AB. also increasingly associated with the respective mixed color green?) \n\nThe chosen states of mind focus primarily on the basic emotions of Ekman and Plutchik.",

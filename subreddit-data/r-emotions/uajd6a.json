    "postText": "I have been thinking about this for a while, as I've probably felt this since I was 13 or so. The feeling in question is a mix between pity, tenderness, sadness, and warmth. I feel it most recently when my girlfriend clung to me, wrapped her arms and legs around me, and begged me not to get out of bed because I'm so warm. I also distinctly remember feeling it when \n\nI saw an adult playing with chess pieces like action figures. \n\nAdults watch children's shows and earnestly enjoy them. \n\nI see someone's reaction to their art being destroyed\n\nOld people crying silently\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this a common thing that other people experience? If so, could someone direct me towards resources about it? \n\nMuch appreciated",

There are infinite unnamed emotions. \n\nThere will never be enough names to adequately describe the full emotional depth of experience. \n\nTo be fair........... words are constructs. \ud83d\ude43\nIt's not reasonable to expect them to fully encompass experience. The chosen \"name\" for an emotion shouldn't limit your experience imo.\n\nAlso! Feel empowered!  English doesn't have a governing linguistic body. The dictionaries troll thr internet and add new words each yeah.\n\nIf we Lack words, make them. Make them have meaning.",

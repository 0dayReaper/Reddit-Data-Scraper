            "comment": "I don't see any problem with suppressing emotions. I mean, not suppressing all emotions but emotions that are just crushy aren't really a big deal. Is it ok? Yes. How to do it? ...That is more difficult haha. I think you'd have to trick yourself into it somehow and make yourself believe that you don't like her. Also, what about having feelings for someone is distracting you from school?? I'm curious. \n\nI take back a little of what I said before suppressing even little emotions makes you unbalanced which will also affect how you work. Accept your feelings but don't do anything about them that would make school harder to manage. \"Hm, I like her. But I like A+ more.\"",

One thing i did was instead of always thinking of how good she is , look at things that might put you off about her ( its a bad thing to do , but whose gonna find out ) , if this sounds like a bad thing for you to do then another way would be to , working a bit too hard , umm this is a bit weird since u said u cannot concentrate , pushing yourself out of your limits could be a very nice way to supress other emotions other than the ones u get from working (studying in this case ) . yes its a very hard thing to do and it doesnt seem like very helpfull but i did this , it sucked but for me not being able to concentrate at all was far more traumatising.\n\nalso , maybe u should confess , taking your feelings out on a page of paper might  be a good way to take them out , if u want to give the paper to her is up to you but if it works then u might get someone to help you with concentrating and even if she doesnt say yes , atleast u got your feelings out .\n\nI hope this could help you , these are things i did from my personal experience and may or may not work for you\n\nGood day ,\n\nAmey",

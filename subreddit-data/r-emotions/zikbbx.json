    "postText": "As I write this I acknowledge that I wasn\u2019t a person that was very open with myself or others i never asked for help even when i knew i needed it,I just couldnt let myself feel weak or vulnerable but at the end i ended up hurting myself the most. Im afraid to speak on how i feel even if its about love or happiness and I really cant blame anyone but myself and i see that now and its hurts because i could\u2019ve asked for help when i was younger but as i get older all I learned from myself was to suffer in silence and i dont even know whats wrong me and all i ever do is push people away.",

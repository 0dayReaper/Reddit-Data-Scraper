I don't get angry Its more like rage, I get filled with rage. I can't ever tell my therapist why I get filled with rage because I can't remember the events leading up to it.\n\nAnyone know what this is?",

When you will read that after getting a calm mind later.. You will feel that those things doesn't matter and your mental peace is more important. Writing down things really helps a lot. \nHope you get your peace soon!",

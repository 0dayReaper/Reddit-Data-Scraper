I dont have to intimate right now i have friends and assets, what matter is my progress. \n\nBut still i want intimacy. Its a battle between wanting to work and wanting intimacy with someone. \n\n\nI used to think it was porn or testosterone rising up cauring horniness. But really is not, i dont even look at porn anymore cuz i know it wont solve that feeling cuz is not a sexual thing. \n\nThis shit brings me into a depressive/boredom state, where everything i have set out to do becomes meaningless. \n\nCant this be a result of low testosterone?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s natural to seek and need intimacy. Connection to others is critical to our health and well-being. Your central nervous system will come up with some very dynamic ways to find this until it feels satisfied, which can explain why people do a lot of things to bring them closer to connection. Or being seen, to then be connected with others. Cutting off this need would be pretty disastrous for the rest of your being. Truly disconnected from emotions and feelings = psychopathic, narcissistic or otherwise \u2018cut off\u2019 personalities. But it is possible to increase one\u2019s feeling of intimacy and connection with self-work. Mediation, prayer, creating a safe place inside one\u2019s self can all be helpful. Or seeking more social connection through healthy social activities: group sports, volunteer work, enjoying connection of pets are all things that can be beneficial as part of the equation perhaps until you find the connections that are best for you.",

I understand why you would want to cut your emotions off. When life is a brutal struggle we really don\u2019t want to feel it. And many people cut themselves off in the path to \u201csuccess.\u201d They end up just as unhappy tho. They can have status, wealth, basically all external signs of prosperity but their internal health and wellness is still unbalanced, or outright lacking. We know how this story ends by the news headlines. Famous people doing desperate things, ending up in terrible situations. If you consider the alternative, a balanced and healthy internal system before any other achievements, you\u2019ll find the people who are happiest, most at peace, truly prosperous in terms of quality of life, even if they haven\u2019t \u201csucceeded\u201d in the social definition we see in modern culture.",

My suffering comes from emotions, emotions is the origin of everything, emotions is the reason why dispite having a huge advantage in my academic life i still unnesesarily suffer.\n\nAlso not everyone gives a shit about their wellness or happiness, is not about me, i dont care if i feel fullfilled or happy, i only care about doing my duty in the world, helping my country and others, that comes fisrts before my happiness. \n\nIf my happiness comes first, i would be a mediocre fuck with no ambition settleling and letting my country rot while i chill in another country being \"happy\" and \"fullfilled\".",

    "postText": "     I am trying to figure out my own mind I am not necessarily posting for anyone to see but if you enjoy that's fine I am just trying to figure out why I am constantly sick and if I am doing it from some medications I take and stop once or twice but this seems to keep happening meds or no med. I know in this world I am very privileged, it seems as though my temperament and not just being angry temperament fails to realize. I feel as though ever human has its best days and worst day. The general feeling of a good day does change over time same with a bad one but I would say for majority that there worst day feel how ninety-nine out of one -hundred of us would feel. \n     I'm going to get to vent here and talking about personal personality. Hope to not be shamed to much I haven't had seen the bright light from the dark nights or life and it is really hard to. I have never tried to hurt myself I've threaten it when I have felt my worst and I feel stagnant but I don't think this should be the way I feel nor deal with it (And I know I'll get a handful saying I should go to counseling and hot it did them wonders \"for myself I have been there it helps to have some one to talk to but it still feels Tip toey\") just an example and not an all the time thing but say I get angry at someone and may want to hurt them in the moment (by hurt kill, maybe just rough them up)  but I never do real damage to any maybe a push if they keep on my nerves\n\n     I'll be back later to talk I kind of want to run for a long time today... even though a couple days ago I walked and felt like heart was pounding a 80 and 90 feeling like I'm going to die I guess we could say I'm going to try I got kids and they need a real dad not a pussy who is scared of their feelings. Be back + my mind 6:15am - 6:44am  Wed March 15 2023 didn't realize it was the 10the anniversary since my brother's death I'm \ud83d\ude4f sorry in sorrow.but life has to go on.",

    "postText": "I hate love. When you fall in love it's like you put that person before anything and you see pass over anything they do. Even if it's hurting you. You don't seem to understand whats hurting you. And when it's all over the relationship its hurts, you cant do much but cry or feel you'r sort of pain. If it's cutting because you'r scared to move on or you want those scar to represent the pain she gave you. Working out because its a sort of pain, also lifting hurts but still is beneficial then you start to change your mindset of looking good and feeling good for yourself before it was for others, and now it's for you. Either one i know (you can move on) even if its hard or if you don't wanna move on because of all the things you wanted to do with her and for her. She didn't care so why care, Fuck that unfinished business. And the worse part it always seem like for the people you truly fucking love they don't love you back. Yes you cant force someone to love you. But do everything to take your mind off her no matter what. Talk to other females trust me it may not feel the same if ya'll fuck but it will help to take your mind off things delete ya'll photos before its to late, give back her stuff don't burn it, Win not lose, cause she clearly didn't see you in pain in the relationships from the start. Relationships are about having someone thats willing to fix it with you and not just move on. Once you find that person she will be your future wife... Yes you will cry at some point but its ok to cry. Crying is just pain you cant express leaving the body don't be selfish let the plants get some water at least you can keep them alive and healthily see theres some things that cant live without you!",

    "postText": "My boyfriend of 7 months and I broke up over something stupid now we're trying to get back together but he says he's built up this wall after that and he first needs to take it down. He also said that he's going to see a therapist and had his first appointment yesterday. He told me that we would fix this together and asked me to wait for him. I'm trying to both give him space and be there for him. It's really sad that he's not emotionally responsive. Any ideas how long this might take with the help of a professional and of course my support so I can prepare myself mentally?",

            "comment": "Great question. The short answer is that it really depends and it\u2019s so personal to the individual, whatever it is that they\u2019ve experienced or why the wall is there, their willingness to heal, but also the capacity to go through the steps needed. It also depends on the quality of the therapist and if they\u2019re a good match for that topic. If you\u2019re willing to work on the relationship it can help too, so best to get good support and go by what feels right for you too, then maybe see how things develop.",

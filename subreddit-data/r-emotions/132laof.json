The short answer is that it really depends and it\u2019s so personal to the individual, whatever it is that they\u2019ve experienced or why the wall is there, their willingness to heal, but also the capacity to go through the steps needed. It also depends on the quality of the therapist and if they\u2019re a good match for that topic. If you\u2019re willing to work on the relationship it can help too, so best to get good support and go by what feels right for you too, then maybe see how things develop.",

    "postText": "So growing up Persian , all I know about love and emotions is from TV , because I'm my household we don't Express our feelings,  we never talk about our feelings,  we don't share anything,  we don't say we love each other, and everything I know is from American sitcoms or shows,  and how they Express their feelings, so now I can't really say things in my own language and I don't have that vast vocabulary to be fluent in English, it's as if I can't really say anything coz I don't have the words for it not that I don't want to share ,and when I want to , it's super awkward,  like suuuuuper awkward man , idk what to do",

Writing them down and selfreflect on your emotions makes you understand yourself better.\n\nWhen you understand yourself better, you'll be more in control of your life. You'll understand why you think, feel and behave the way you do.\n\nIf you have questions just ask.",

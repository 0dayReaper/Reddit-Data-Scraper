    "postText": "Okay so I just had a mind pop and realized where my mental health really started to decline. So I was a kid with a single mother until I was 9, then got an abusive step-dad until I was 17, so when I was 16 my mom split with my pre step dad and we moved back to our home state, my mom would torment me about it poking fun at the idea that we have to move back \"home\" but the thing is I was very upset about having to leave the established life I had where I currently was just to have to go back to my hometown. So that happened. I started smoking weed all day e everyday and haven't stopped since. Went through school thinking I wouldn't graduate yet I did. I went back to the state we lived in and had good and bad times. I did graduate. I am now back in my hometown though living on my own. Idk if I just discovered another piece of the problem or one of the roots but I remember my mental health getting really really bad after my mom took me to see her father's grave and right next to it was where she said she was gonna have me buried if I passed away. Meaning she got a burial plot right next to my grandpa's. He passed when I was about 2 or 3 so I never eve. Knew him, but idk. That's the day my mental health began a serious decline and here we are now. I'm not doing \"bad\" but my mind is really fucked. Sorry for telling my life story but I don't really have friends anymore and don't know how to express the vastness of complex emotions I have even though it feels so significant to.",

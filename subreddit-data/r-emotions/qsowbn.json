    "postText": "\nI have been thinking on how emotion plays into decision making, particularly with \"Scout Mindset\" by Galef and \"The Righteous Mind\" by Haidt. I am trying to modify Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions Model ([Useful Article](https://jurij-fedorov.medium.com/categorizing-emotions-1e1de471a2a1)), to make a tool for people to identify feelings and move to adjacent feelings that are more appropriate. Also eventually, I want to have it  working in reverse (type in the emotion and get the components). Most of the interesting things I think would be where confusion mixes with others. A scout for instance would try and avoid the conflict axis, while a soldier would try and avoid the fear axis. I also think if I can figure out the Profane/Sacred Axis I might be able to understand the emotional truth that Jordan Peterson taps into (and why people love his ideas).\n\nTrying to fill out the matrix with relevant words/ emotions (if they exist) or good placeholder names if they don't.  Also if something doesn't seem to fit where it is, I want remove it.\n\nVery early prototype I am throwing together to look at combos. Only works on desktop and phones in horizontal orientation.

            "comment": "It's not uncommon for people to go through periods where they don't feel particularly emotional and where they don't have the urge to cry. I want to clarify that everyone experiences emotions differently, and there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to crying or other emotional expressions.\n\nThat being said, sometimes a lack of crying or emotional expression can be a sign of suppression. Sometimes people suppress their emotions and don't allow themselves to feel sadness or other emotions, which can lead to a lack of emotional expression such as crying. This could stem from a variety of reasons such as avoiding vulnerability, a desire to appear strong, or a fear of being judged for showing emotions.\n\nAlternatively, a lack of crying may also be a sign that you are in a relatively stable and content emotional state right now. If you are experiencing relative happiness and contentment in your life, you may simply not have a need to express intense sadness through crying. \n\nIt's important to recognize that emotions can be complex and multifaceted, and there is no right or wrong way to experience them. It's okay to not cry and experience a full range of emotions all the time. However, if you find yourself struggling with your emotional expression or feel that you are suppressing your emotions, it might be helpful to simply be patient. \n\nYou are strong and capable.  You are intelligent too! I think that it's okay to feel a bit depressed sometimes. But frankly, lack of connection is the most common sign of feeling depressed.  But I swear to you! \ud83d\udcaf,  it's okay to feel depressed.  It's OK to be sad.\n\nSit and reflect on the pain that keeps knocking. See the experience from all angles.  Decide what lessons you should learn from it. Look at it from all angles. Be yourself in the past, present, and future.",

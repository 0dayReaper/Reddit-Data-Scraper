    "postText": "I feel like i don't belong in my own life. I don't think anyone understands me or how I feel when it matters. My own family doesn't carry out conversations with me and it makes me feel like I'd be better off not being where I am. I know somewhere, people care about me but I feel like im not allowed to reach out for help because it's a burden to others. I don't have as much energy as i typically would, nor do i care about stuff as much as I wanted. Im going to college in 29 days and I don't know if i can last that long. But I've lived like this for this long. What's another 29 days? I feel alone and worthless. I stay in bed most of the day sleeping and not doing anything productive or worthwhile although I know I should be because there's plenty of things i could be doing. I have these random bursts of encouragement and happiness that quickly get sucked out of my soul due to the negative energy around me.",

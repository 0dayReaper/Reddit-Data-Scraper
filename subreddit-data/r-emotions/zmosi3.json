You need to spend energy into filling those buckets and when they are filled at a certain level the emptiness goes away.\n\nYou need healthy food, water, sleep. You need to exercise your body and mind and do stuff you enjoy like being social, play games with other people, help people, let people help you, make/fix things, learn things, and so on.\n\nAnd everything needs to be in balance. \n\n- So when you just focus on one single need there still be other empty buckets, the emptiness will still be there. \n- And overdoing stresses the body, mind and soul, you can't go on and on. Like you got to water a plant just enough that it can grow, but when you water too much it's roots will drown.\n\nSo make a list of needs (not wishes) and check which ones need more attention.\n\nAnd one sneaky thing I discovered. Don't depend on others to fill your needs. Like the need for love. You'll always have to be the one who fills it first by taking care of wellbeing. If you don't love yourself, never expect someone to love you.",

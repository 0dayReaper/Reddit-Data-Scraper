    "postText": "Hi all, I wanted to reach out to see if anyone would be interested in being a part of a short video project. The idea behind the project is to inspire others to be more open to talking about their own personal stories, perspectives and learned experiences throughout their life. There is a question sheet for people to provide their response in a short self-filmed video on your phone (as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing). You only need to pick 2 or 3 of the questions to respond to. I've added the link below.\n\n[Questions Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsWvvsDAAX7d5DabP2Ieh4AdY0FWfsZd/edit?usp=share_link&amp;ouid=108690919500325387585&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)\n\nPlease send through your video submission to this email: [findingallegra@gmail.com](mailto:findingallegra@gmail.com)\n\nThis is not a project in which we are seeking any monetary incentive but rather more of a social experiment. Thanks!",

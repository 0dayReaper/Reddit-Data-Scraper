I liked the guy and we had fun, after 2 months he said \u201cI love you.\u201d About a week after I broke up with him, he ask multiple time why and all I could say is \u201c I don\u2019t wanna hurt you, I don\u2019t feel the same.\u201d I honestly did feel bad but i thought it was for the best and i moved on.\n\n I had told some close friends about the situation and they asked why, I told them the same thing, that i didn\u2019t feel the same. Then they asked \u201c In your ideal relationship when would you say \u201cI love you\u201d and I said that I didn\u2019t know. They asked \u201c after 3 months?\u201d, I said no. \u201cAfter 6 months?\u201d I said no. \u201cAfter 8 months?\u201d I said maybe. They began to tell me that I was weird and I didn\u2019t know why. After thinking about it for a while I realized that I would never really do any of the regular relationship things, like calling someone babe or baby, hold hands, have matching outfits, post a partner on social media, etc. To be honest I don\u2019t really want to be in a \u201crelationship\u201d per say, I would prefer to be in a situation where we respect the fact that we are a thing, just not bf/gf. I see others in relationships and see how they call each other babe/baby and do regular relationship things and think oh that cute, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s for me. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it I can\u2019t do those things. \n\nDo I have commitment issues?",

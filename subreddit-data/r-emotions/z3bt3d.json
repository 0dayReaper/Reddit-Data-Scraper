            "comment": "Hey :) I feel similar things. Here are a couple thoughts I found useful\n- knowing how to describe what you are feeling and its causes are a big part of intentionally changing it in a healthy way\n- building change takes time. This involves building habits which are practiced. Being able to verbalize this reliably (see above) helps this.\n- learning knew things takes time because change requires pushing past your comfort area, becoming used to it / making peace, and then doing it again.\n- Humans are great at understanding something but are also slow to change. This can cause tension.\n\nHope you find something in these!",

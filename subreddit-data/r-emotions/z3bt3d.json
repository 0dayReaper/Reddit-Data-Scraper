    "postText": "Why am I still so scared of opening up to people? I thought that I would have healed by now or something. I don\u2019t want to get hurt again so I keep purposely keeping them far away from me emotionally until I \u201cfeel\u201d like everything is going to be okay. NOTHING is EVER going to be 100% okay though right? I need to open up to others and let them in if I want to be with girls and be in a relationship again or have more close friends. God damn. It\u2019s easier said than done but for Christ sake I have to just give it a shot. Yeah it is scary but I have to give it a shot. Otherwise nothing will change. If I want something to change then I have to be willing to do so. Fuck.",

            "comment": "Hey :) I feel similar things. Here are a couple thoughts I found useful\n- knowing how to describe what you are feeling and its causes are a big part of intentionally changing it in a healthy way\n- building change takes time. This involves building habits which are practiced. Being able to verbalize this reliably (see above) helps this.\n- learning knew things takes time because change requires pushing past your comfort area, becoming used to it / making peace, and then doing it again.\n- Humans are great at understanding something but are also slow to change. This can cause tension.\n\nHope you find something in these!",

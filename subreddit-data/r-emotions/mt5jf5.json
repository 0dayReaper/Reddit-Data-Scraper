It's a feeling when you become hyper aware of everything in your surroundings and inside your body. A state of mind in where you cannot place any name to anything you're aware of. EX: You are aware of the birds whitelisting and how your ear rings and how your body reacts to the sound, there is no name to put to any of the causes or reactions of the birds whistle.

    "postText": "So, it might sound stupid, but I've been thinking about this topic for a long while, and I can't seem to find a reason for it. Whenever someone raises their voice at me, even just in the slightest way, I get sad and feel like crying.  Sometimes, even their body language is enough to make me feel stupid. For example, I tickeld my bf, and he was laughing at first, because obviously, but then he told me to stop. He got serious, but that's understandable; he wanted me to stop. Yet I got really sad, and that happens a lot, and I can't really explain to myself why.",

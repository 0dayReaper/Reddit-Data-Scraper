    "postText": "So my best friend and I have become a little distant. She called me for some stupid pyramid scheme thing and I told her that I'm not interested. Back to our friendship, she doesn't pick my calls nor does she respond to my texts. Now, I've been covid positive and dying of boredom, she knows it yet she ignores me. I like her. I mean she helped me a lot when things were sad in my life. But I get the feeling that I need to terminate the friendship. Thoughts ?",

You may have to invest less energy if she doesn't respond to your needs when she is off pouting over a misdeed. We need friendships that allow and support autonomy.",

But now she's bored with you?\n\nThat doesn't mean she's a bad person.  But maybe not great \"close friend\" material. \n\nShe didn't enjoy you as a person.... so much as she enjoyed helping your situation.\n\nMaybe you can invest your energy elsewhere.",

Maybe there's something in between?",

She was very nonchalant about knowing about my covid and yet not even texting me to know whether I'm alright or not. I expressed my concerns honestly and she did not like it. I have one less friend now. I guess I never had a friend. But life is good. I'm glad I was honest and want to have good, positive friendships in the future.",

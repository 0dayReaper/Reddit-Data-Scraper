I want to ask someone else that feels like they're never in the moment like something truly exciting that takes your mind off everything and do you ever dress long for that feeling but it just never comes? That's my state of mind",

And even look for happiness in a way. At times, I have thoughts that often prevents me from being happy. No matter what settting I am in, whether it would be exciting or where I can take my mind off of things. There are times when I hangout with people and see them having fun and whatnot and here I am feeling numb. Even when I am in my own space, I go back to feeling the numbness. It didn't help that, at one point, I was hanging out with the wrong crowd that didnt't accept who I was and forced me to become a person who they wanted me to be. Which, I didnt realize at the time. I, unfortunately, am still on that road. I wish I can tell you what can help, but just wanted to let you know that you are not the only one who feels that way. I have a little trouble reading the post, I apologoze if I am entirely wrong.",

I have the same experience, I can't help but feel too much and most of the time, my emotions burst in the form of crying. I'm sorry I have no solution, but you're not alone.\n\nBut if you want my advice, don't try to become numb. It hurts more and it won't help. I hope one day we find a way to accept our strong emotions.",

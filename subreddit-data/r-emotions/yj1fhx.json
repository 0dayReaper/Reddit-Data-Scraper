    "postText": "I\u2019ve always been nicknamed a crybaby for as long as I can remember but as I get older I feel like i\u2019ve become worse. I cry over every tiny amount of emotion I feel. I think I cry the most mainly when I feel overwhelmed or shy. For example, my parents laughed over a dumb comment I had made and I felt embarrassed which quickly resulted in having tears.  As a kid I feel like it was more socially acceptable to cry over little things but I\u2019m now becoming an age where I feel like I\u2019m being looked down upon. I\u2019m still very young but I\u2019m always embarrassed when I\u2019m caught crying which causes me to bawl even more. I begin to overthink their impression on me now that they\u2019ve deemed me as sensitive. I instantly cry from thinking about certain situations or when I talk about my vulnerability. I wish I could become numb for a while.",

I have the same experience, I can't help but feel too much and most of the time, my emotions burst in the form of crying. I'm sorry I have no solution, but you're not alone.\n\nBut if you want my advice, don't try to become numb. It hurts more and it won't help. I hope one day we find a way to accept our strong emotions.",

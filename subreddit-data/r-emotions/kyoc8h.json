    "postText": "Hi,\n\nIs it healthy for oneself and the other person(s) to show or express ones emotions as is or should one process them and show the jist of the emotions in a conversation with an even tone?\n\nFor example, if I am angry, should I express the feelings as is and show the anger (in a non-abusive or bad way) or should I process the emotions and tell the other person in a non-emotional tone that I am angry at something and tell the reason for it?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Aristotle said something along the lines that anger should be utilized in the right way, at the right time, in the right degree. I tend to agree and I would say you are the best judge as to when that time and context takes place.\n\nAs far as telling someone your angry, I imagine that they already know, since anger is usually one of the easiest emotions to read. Usually the eyebrows come down and the nostrils flare. You might have a good understanding of the knowledge of anger. You could know that anger sends catecholamines throughout the body and moves blood into vital areas getting you ready to fight. This doesn't mean you can prevent yourself from being angry, just by knowing the content. The process still exists and all you can really do is to try and either distract yourself from the source of anger, (time will help lower the catecholamines), or be angry in a just way. You can tell someone you are angry, but it probably won't be helpful if they are as well, and the process is still going to occur. It might be helpful to take the appropriate amount of time, at your own discretion, and see why you are angry. \n\nAnger usually means you feel cheated, and you want to make it fair. Anger serves a purpose, but it is not always helpful. If you keep in mind why you are angry you can usually notice some other emotions happening concurrently with anger. You can feel up to 5 at the same time, and odds are you probably are feeling 3 at any given time. Usually you just are aware of the one that is using the most energy at the time.\n\nI think if you keep the reason for anger in mind, know how to employ that anger for your own benefit, have sympathy for others, and understand that you cannot stop the process, but maybe slow down your direct reaction to it, anger no longer becomes a problem, but more of a tool to express yourself in a healthy way. I hope this was helpful!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s difficult to express anger in an angry way \u2018as is\u2019 and not affect another person negatively. Either they\u2019ll be scared of your anger or angered by it in turn or shut down and block it. It\u2019s unlikely that your anger would be received positively or constructively. Other emotions, such as sorrow are different, they inspire sympathy and invite others (who are empathetic) to offer comfort. Positive emotions such as joy are much easier to share. \nIf your aim is to express yourself clearly and constructively to someone you feel anger towards, then the better time to do that is when the peak of anger has passed and you are able to speak calmly. Or better still, before you become angry. \nIf someone is making you angry, be aware that they may be \u2018pushing your buttons\u2019 entirely unintentionally, and that you may be responding more to past events and experiences than to present ones.",

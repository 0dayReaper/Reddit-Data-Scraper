Had I been given an option, I will choose death anytime but life does not let me die. It makes me suffer for no reason.",

Even if right now that's the only think that seems like it would help, I give you my word that life is gonna get better. I absolutely love you , and I wish you the best !!! Have a fantastic day/night !!!\n\nPS: when I just start flipping off life and other people randomly, I really don't care who it is, while I have some metal music playing, I feel a lot better. That might be because of my anger issues that other people have made me develope for myself. None the less, you should try it if you are into that !",

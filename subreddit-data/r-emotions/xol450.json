    "postText": "When I\u2019m unhappy about something I respond by shutting everyone out. \n\nWhen I\u2019m unhappy about my parents not giving me attention I respond by ignoring them more, not answering them and shoving them away. (Punish back twice as hard, you know?)\n\nBecause of this they think I want to be left alone but I\u2019m screaming for attention. They never just sit down to spend time talking with me. If we \u201ctalk\u201d it\u2019s a short question like \u201chow was school?\u201d I don\u2019t want to talk about that crap, I want to talk about what we\u2019re thinking and feeling and what ideas we\u2019ve come up with lately.\n\nThey also lash out on me at least once a week because one of them has a bad temper. \u201cThe house is a mess!\u201d etc, etc.\n\nThis makes me furious and I shut myself away even more. It\u2019s a dark circle and I feel so lonely and lost in my head.\n\nLately I wake up and don\u2019t want to step out of bed. I feel very unhappy about going to school and I\u2019ve skipped it several times because my parents aren\u2019t home so they don\u2019t notice. Four days a week they spend not being home. I\u2019m not a kid anymore but I feel like they\u2019re not giving me any attention.\n\nAny tips? Maybe I\u2019m just a hormonal teenager but I\u2019m usually not like this and I want to go back to the normal happy me.",

            "comment": "Being ignored or blamed by family is an alien and alienating experience because the natural and healthy way for close humans to relate to each other is through kindness and affection.   \n\nBecause we know this on an instinctive level if we don\u2019t get kindness or can\u2019t give it we feel frustrated and uncared for.\n\nThere really is no substitute for actual kindness and the physical demonstration of affection, aka hugging.  \nLove is defined (Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled) as doing things for someone with the intention of helping them to feel happy to be themselves. This includes listening in a non judgemental way.  \n\nI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to take control of this situation for yourself.   \nAs a child you were dependent on your parents to set the tone of your relationship and lacked the life experience or knowledge to explain your needs.   \nNow you recognise the problem and know that things must change. \nYour own family must become your project, for your benefit and theirs.   \nKindness and communication are essential to any happy relationship, family or other, it\u2019s how we tell each other what we need, and our needs won\u2019t be met unless we can express them in a good way.   \nSadly so many people have no understanding of how to do this without aggression or manipulation.  \nIn order to solve this problem you\u2019re going to have to teach your family how to communicate in a good way.   \nAvoiding this problem is clearly not working for you and will not work in the future.   \nEven when you leave home this unresolved problem will continue to affect your relationship with your parents.   \nWhile you\u2019re living in the same house is the ideal time to change things but you\u2019re going to have to stop avoiding it and hoping that they\u2019ll somehow change.  \nWithout your help they won\u2019t.\n\nI strongly recommend that you become much better informed about healthy communication and how this affects relationships. \nLuckily you don\u2019t have to do all the research yourself,   \na man called Marshall Rosenberg has already been doing it for years, helping families and working in war zones.  \nLook up\u2019 Non Violent Communication\u2019 or NVC online. There are videos of seminars and books on how to communicate your needs and how to understand others.   \n\nHere\u2019s a starter:\nhttps://youtu.be/VT8KGgDo6TY",

I am going to check out the videos you recommended.\n\nI know that you can\u2019t expect your surroundings to change for you, because they won\u2019t easily, only you can change your own behavior\u2026\n\n-but, the point is I don\u2019t want to give them the satisfaction of giving in and being all \u2018happy and joyful\u2019 because I never know when they\u2019re going to start fighting and completely ruin my will of being happy.\n\nI might just be really selfish or something, I don\u2019t know. What happens when they fight is that they somehow succeed to find something to scold me for too, like I will defend myself and they will turn it into me being a selfish kid and \u201cyou can forget about this and this and now you will not have any friends over again\u201d and this makes me upset so I try to defend myself against them and BAM, I\u2019m in deep shit. \n\nBecause of this I\u2019ve found myself to not trust myself being happy around them. Does that make sense? \n\nI\u2019m pretty much just babbling right now, haha, but I never really dare to talk to people about this.",

You want to limit their ability to disappoint you by withholding your affection and outward signs of happiness.  \nEvery communication between people is saying \u201cI want\u201d or \u201cMore please.\u201d It\u2019s common for people to mistake their desires for their actual needs and to use force or manipulation to try to ensure their desires ante satisfied. This is what\u2019s called \u2018Violent Communication.\u2019  \nThis is usually because they\u2019ve learned from past experience that being honest about their wants doesn\u2019t get them fulfilled.  \nIf you learn more about Non Violent Communication you\u2019ll see the difference between wants and needs and how to hear your parents\u2019 real needs being expressed. You\u2019ll also understand how to express your needs and how to not be distracted by their wants.  \nTo make a difference you must decide to be a force for good in your family, not just for your sake but for theirs as well. If your intention is to bring clarity and peace to your family then this is love.   \nI\u2019m not saying it will be quick or easy but with greater understanding and practise you\u2019ll have a valuable skill that will help you in all aspects of your life.",

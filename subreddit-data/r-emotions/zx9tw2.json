They have to be allowed to do what feels right for them.  \n\nAn extended hug (20 plus seconds) is known to cause a release of serotonin and dopamine which feel great, relieve stress and anxiety and promote deep bonds of affection and love.     \n\nI have a particular friend who enjoys long hugs very much. Neither of us have partners and  hugs are part of our regular \u2018therapeutic\u2019 interaction.  \nIt may be the case that the ideal partner for you is someone who also enjoys big hugs.",

But still it hurts me bcs In the end, it's almost always me the one who has to make their feelings smaller or repress them in order to keep things acceptable. And I don't think that's fair either.\n\nNad yeah, maybe I have to find people who shares that with me. But knowing people as an adult without looking weird is hard.",

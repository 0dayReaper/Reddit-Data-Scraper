But each day the pain still doesn\u2019t fade. 5 months since working hard on revenge to see if it will help me get what I had back. 5 months later it isn\u2019t helping me how I\u2019m feeling. How does one hate and love the same person so much. It\u2019s emotionally hell. Please let my emotions come out through said revenge. I want my happy ending",

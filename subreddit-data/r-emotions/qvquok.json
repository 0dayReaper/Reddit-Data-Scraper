I have an attachment disorder so if I get attached to things and those things go/finish etc it really really hurts and I struggle to cope with it. Help me      \n  \nEdit: I\u2019m very sad and I hate it, because it\u2019s weak and painful and that\u2019s making me angry. Why can\u2019t I just be happy, emotions are difficult",

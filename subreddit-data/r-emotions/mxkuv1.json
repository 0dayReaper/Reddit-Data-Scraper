            "comment": "Hey, it is okay to feel this way! It's understandable to dislike people and even to \"hate\" a few particular people due to them having done something serious to negatively affect you or others. When you start to feel like you hate everyone in general though, it can cause some problems in your life and your regular interactions with those around you and may indicate some other issues within yourself as well. However, first, you need to decide whether you truly hate others or if something else may be bothering you. If it truly is hatred that you're feeling so often, there can be quite a few reasons behind it and it's also important to know the solutions for the same. If hatred or a constant strong dislike of other people seems to be affecting your life, it is a good option to reach for professional support so that they can assist you in coping with your emotions, as well as to find healthy solutions for the problems associated with these feelings. Hope it's helpful!",

It can make you tired and put you into a state of energy preservation, where your brain will automatically want to keep you \"safe\" by avoiding others. \n\nMy suggestion is to give yourself some space with energy dense tasks, and take a bit of time to do something light and relaxing for yourself.\n\nYou probably don't hate others, you just need a bit more time to unwind and process the positive moments of your day.",

            "comment": "1. Forgiveness and self-forgiveness, if you do end up pissing people off. Just because you are disappointed with someone or annoyed with someone at that current moment doesn't mean you don't care about them. They might already be in a bad mood from stuff going on in their own lives, and you aren't responsible for their emotional dispositions. The opposite is also true. It's also nigh impossible to put on a good face all the time for others, and if you try it could make things worse. Most people are really good at telling if other peoples minds are occupied, or if they are not telling you how they feel, and they tend to assume it's something they're doing wrong. A majority of the time, they just want to understand what you aren't telling them.\n\n\n2. Gratitude, let them know that you appreciate them (say it however is natural for you), and that right now you are stressed out with school. Tell them that in order to deal with school right now you need a bit of space, and that you still enjoy being with them. You could maybe suggest that after school is done, and you had some time to recover, that you could celebrate the end of the semester.\n\n\n3. Vent your frustrations healthily. Instead of blowing up on your teachers, family, or friends, try going to an area without any people and screaming. Anger works off catecholamines, which build up in the body to cause a movement response necessary to break the flight and freeze responses of fear. (It's not always the case that you will be in a fearful state when you are angry though. Fear makes up something like 70% of our lives, and that other 30% could contain some anger as well.) If you go scream about it for a little while, but please don't do it enough that you loose your voice, then you can try the other way to reduce catecholamines, distraction. Distraction probably isn't the right way to vent the stress you are having now, but it is an option. I also have a hard time doing so, because most of the time it's something that I need to say or do that I avoid at first and it is keeping me angry. But, if you can properly distract yourself from the things that are making you angry, and take a short mental break. (Usually an hour works.) Then it could be helpful. Again I wouldn't suggest it.\n\n\nA final thing to consider is that while emotions are useful, they are not always helpful. I hope this is helpful to you! Good luck with finals!",

    "postText": "I seem to not give a single fuck about people who i dont know. I mean in the context of when they hang out with me and my friends. It also depends on the person. For example, i have this friend and his girlfriend hangs out with us from time to time. She has 2 friends that she brings, one of them i like and i would do anything for her as i would for my friends and people i care about. The other one really doesn\u2019t matter to me, I really couldn\u2019t care if she dropped dead when hanging out. I never really had a conversation with either of them. I have this with many people, man and woman. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong i have 100% control and can act like a normal person to everyone. I just find my though process on this weird.\nAny has the same?",

    "postText": "One time a friend told me that instead of feeling sad about something, just feel angry about it. Instead of thinking \u201chow can they do this to me\u201d, think \u201chow dare they\u201d.. \n\nThis was working for a while, because personally speaking, anger is way easier to let out than sadness. Sadness lingers for a while and the physical pain that comes with it is a nightmare. It makes you feel insecure, disappointed, helpless, or drains you emotionally and leaves you feeling fatigued etc.\n\nHowever, anger has this sense of superiority, if that makes sense. I\u2019ve never felt insecure while angry? It\u2019s more like being filled with energy that you want to let out, getting up and doing something, hurt someone\u2019s feelings in return or break their nose..\n\nThe issue is that, I\u2019m now more angry than usual. I get mad at the slightest things and constantly react negative and way too quickly and it clouds my judgement at times. I\u2019ve never been an angry person. This often put me in embarrassing situations.",

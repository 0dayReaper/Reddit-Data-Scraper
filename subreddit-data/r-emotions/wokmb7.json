            "comment": "The mind is the solar plexus, the abdominal brain, creating feelings/emotions which are what motivates all of us.\n\nFeelings determine our choices, not our thoughts.\n\nAs a species we have a very highly developed ability to examine the reactions of those around us in order to understand our place in the family and within a social group.\n\nDuring our evolution this was essential for survival as no individual would survive long on their own without the protection and help of others.\n\nA vital part of learning how to fit in with the family and tribe was the ability to examine one\u2019s own behaviour and learn how that is received by others.\n\nIn terms of normal socialisation the purpose is for each individual to learn how to create Bonds of trust and caring with others, which are the essential foundation of a cooperative and social species.  \nHowever, this necessary examination and awareness of our own actions and how they are received by others leads inevitably to introspection and even self obsession.\n\nThis is especially true if our early experience as children makes us uncertain how to act or behave in order to feel cared for, accepted and loved within our family or group.\n\nThe natural reaction of our solar plexus to a belief that we are not welcomed or wanted or loved within our family is to signal a feeling of distress or anxiety within our abdomen.\n\nThis feeling triggers our imagination to try to find a solution.\n\nAnd inevitably we question our own actions and behaviour to try to find the answer to the question \u201cwhy don\u2019t I feel okay?\u201d  \nBut very often there is no answer to this question.\n\nThe feeling may lie with the people around us.\n\nI am not saying necessarily that your feelings and your overactive thoughts and introspection are the result of not receiving enough expressions of love when you were younger, but you may have to accept That you will not find an answer within yourself.\n\nIt may be that forming good friendships and close bonds and a sense of purpose outside yourself will soothe your anxiety and thereby allow your thoughts to calm also.",

A \"distraction\" from all this has been my projects and hanging out with other people doing voluntary work for a bigger purpose. Im inside a an idiologicak group and have other projects (university, music). But this is very unstable. And university, i have to deal a lot with myself to susceed, even with some people, and people distract mez causing a depletion in performance in college.  So its like, i go out to do something outside, put my mind to work, then i come back to my house to enter the dream again. And even outside doing stuff feels like a dream. But yeah you nailed what has been helping me with things.",

It\u2019s a beautiful way to acknowledge all the \u201cparts\u201d that are speaking to you, to allow them to speak and share what they want you to see, and in welcoming them (rather than resisting) integrate their wisdom, which lessens the impulse and allows the true self to come through. Beautiful stuff if you\u2019d like to try something like this.",

It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve done some research yourself but it can\u2019t take the place of professional support. If it feels that urgent for you I\u2019d say you should find some help soon. The magic really starts happening when you can let someone else guide. Trying to do self-work and guide yourself takes a lot of the energy needed for the actual healing process. Think of it this way, doing the research is great to learn about it, see if it feels like a good fit for you, to anticipate the experience. But it can\u2019t replace the experience. Just like researching a delicious meal can\u2019t replace the actual event of experiencing it.",

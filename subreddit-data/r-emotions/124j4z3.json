I've been feeling pretty upset  like I'm going to cry and I keep having that feeling of a lump in my throat which I've never experienced before. I can't tell the difference between that and a dry throat though, I keep feeling like I need to cough or have a drink of water or something but I can't tell if its just the lump or not.",

    "postText": "Maybe that\u2019s an extreme way of putting it. But I always have some extreme flaw that just ruins me. I just can\u2019t be normal. No matter what it is. I just can\u2019t be a happy, cool, normal person like most. I\u2019m cursed with all these problems in my life and getting extremely emotional about them. I wish I could get a new brain so that I wouldn\u2019t have to put up with them anymore. That would be so nice. But oh well. That\u2019s not so easy. I\u2019m stuck trying to fight off my negative feelings and mental problems for I don\u2019t know how long. This was all so much easier in 2011 and 2012 when I was a much happier person without this kind of shit whatsoever. And I have been fairly happy recently. But the issues I have aren\u2019t gone and I wish they would just go already. It would be really nice to be born anew but I think that\u2019s really difficult to do. If I could do it though, I would. Just to feel the way I did when I was still a kid. When I was entertained by funny things and not plagued by emotional and mental problems. I would do so much just to get that me back. Or be someone else than who I am now. But I can\u2019t. At least seemingly not. So, what can I do about it?",

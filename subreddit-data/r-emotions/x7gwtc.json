If you don\u2019t and just have sadness, try distracting yourself. Try new things such as new foods, learn a hobby, change jobs/careers, find new friendships etc. \n\nTrying new things helped me greatly reduce my depression. I had bad depression as a teen and most of my early 20s. One day I got tired of being sad and took a job in another state\u2026. My life changed tremendously for the best. I now rarely feel sad and find happiness in things I least expect!",

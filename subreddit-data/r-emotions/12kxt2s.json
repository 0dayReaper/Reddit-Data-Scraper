    "postText": "The memory is a knife. It's blade starts at the top of my head. As a memory unfolds, the knife is dragged downward, dissecting me, until it reaches its end. Leaving all of my insides exposed, spilling out. Nothing fits as nicely. When I stuff it back in. After I cauterize the wound I have to take rest. I'm left fragile, prone to ripping open once again.",

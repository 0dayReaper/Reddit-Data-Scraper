We forget they have a choice about whether or not they want to meet our demands.   \nFrom an early age we learn how to coerce and demand and manipulate to get what we want, even if we don\u2019t know we\u2019re doing it and think we\u2019re being reasonable and fair.     \n\u2018Non Violent Communication\u2019 teaches how to identify real needs and express them in a way that can be heard and understood.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NH1MKAdxUpQ",

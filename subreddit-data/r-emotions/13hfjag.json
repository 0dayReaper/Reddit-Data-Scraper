    "postText": "How do you guys keep your mouth and emotions in check. Basically I have been feeling off lately that no matter what I say to my husband is seen as why are you getting angry or shouting. Or if we are just discussing or reviewing the fight so that I can put my point across as to why I lost my temper, he would try to shut me up by saying- don\u2019t say anything because if I start you will end up crying. The statement enough is to put me off and makes me feel like crying.\n\nSo my point is how do you guys make sure you are not expressing your feelings or opinions. I seem to have no control over my tongue. And I feel that my husband is not the safe space for expressing myself as I thought him to be!",

We forget they have a choice about whether or not they want to meet our demands.   \nFrom an early age we learn how to coerce and demand and manipulate to get what we want, even if we don\u2019t know we\u2019re doing it and think we\u2019re being reasonable and fair.     \n\u2018Non Violent Communication\u2019 teaches how to identify real needs and express them in a way that can be heard and understood.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NH1MKAdxUpQ",

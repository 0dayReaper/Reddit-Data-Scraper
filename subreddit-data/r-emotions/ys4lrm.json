    "postText": "Hey everyone, I wrote a kids book that helps kids express their emotions. It uses pictures and includes a fun little chart so the child can point to how they are feeling if they cant verbally communicate or doesn't want to verbally say how they feel. also included in the book is a tracking chart where the parent can track daily emotions, situations or behaviors. you can get it on amazon and ill leave the link attached. If you do get it I would love some feedback via reviews thank you in advance and i hope this helps you and your child communicate.",

I can't believe I got banned for just saying my thoughts which thats what that sub is about. I was just going thought a bad moment trying to get my emotions out and they banned me for being respectful",

Just because I added the word trans that change? That's bullshit dude and you know it.",

I went through your acc and everyone seems to disagree with you but I don't think you're wrong.\n\nI think in what you posted you said \"it's wrong to go through all that (to surgically change your gender), because both men and women have masculine and feminine traits, so no need to change gender\".\n\nIf that's what you said then you probably meant \"you don't need to worry about your current gender and go through all of that to change it. Just accept who you are right now because both men and women have masculine and feminine traits\".\n\nWell if that's what you meant + you said you respect others' opinions, then I don't find you disrespectful at all. The moderator overreacted and it's not your fault. You know being LGBTQ now is a trend and everyone thinks we have to support them and stuff like that, but it's just propaganda. People get offended for no reason when you talk about it. \n\nI say believe in what you believe in and don't care about others. This moderator was just overreacting.",

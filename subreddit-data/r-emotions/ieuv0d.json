    "postText": "It happens at night, usually when I drink coffee few hours before I sleep, knowing that it will delay my sleeping muse. \n\nIn this time of the night thoughts float to different places. I meet the people whom I know must have no good memory with me, although I know they might never think of me but still.. If something makes people remember my existence, what is it? \n\nTonight I started crying for my brother.. I want to learn more about human psychology, about different personalities, so maybe I could understand him, and maybe I could choose a good approach to talk to him. To understand him. He is not choosing any career so far. And works very little, and he is 22. Ah Communication between people, why is it so hard sometimes????",

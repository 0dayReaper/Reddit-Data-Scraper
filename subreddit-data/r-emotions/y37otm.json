Defending their downfalls, supporting their growth, and lying vulnerable in their presence.\n\nNow, imagine having your vulnerabilities used against you.\n\nImagine divulging your past fears, and having them become jump scares.\n\nImagine revealing the obstacles you've climbed, and having a replica of those hurdles dangled in front of your face.\n\nImagine being told to be exactly who you are. \n\nNow imagine being taunted for being exactly that outside of closed doors.\n\nDid that hurt? \n\nDid you feel that?\n\nDid you take a deep breath? \n\nDid you sink your toes into the mud as you walked away?\n\nDo you need a hand? \n\nPlease trust me. You had only walked through the screen door. That inside deadbolt was always locked. You've been reaching through the mail slot. Let the door remain closed. Stop knocking.\n\n\u2661",

I'm not losing a person, I'm gaining more of myself. \n\nI also understand how difficult that is for many people to believe, because many people struggle to reach it. But this is my way of offering healing, through sharing how I've healed myself.\n\nWalking away isn't the end of a book. It's just that last sentence at the end of a chapter. I choose to keep reading. \u2661",

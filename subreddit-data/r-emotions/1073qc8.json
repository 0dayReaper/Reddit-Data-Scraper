But is it weird that since I don\u2019t allow myself to express the feelings through tears and things like that, I shake ??\nPositive feelings, excitement, hope, stress and anxiety, fear obviously but also anger and sadness (which also makes me nauseous?) \nIs it normal ? Should I try to stop and how can I if I should",

I thought i was just being weird but reading this im curious what causes it then. I have PTSD from a career i had in Law Enforcement and i used to get flashbacks and right before it happened i would get overwhelmed with a plethora of emotions and start shaking or my entire body would tense so hard it hurt. If you find answers give an update plesse.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for reaching out. Involuntary shaking can be indicative of some serious concerns like epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s, etc. but in the context of repressed emotions it has a \u2018normal\u2019 place as the body is trying to discharge the emotional charges it harbors. Similar to when an animal is threatened in the wild, when it eventually reaches a safe place, it will shake as an involuntary response to what it just encountered. This discharges the excess energy and helps the central nervous system to reset. With guidance from your therapist and other medical professionals you may want to share this to rule out any more serious possibilities. This isn\u2019t medical advice of course so it\u2019s anecdotal but hope it gives you some direction to pursue for peace of mind.",

Otherwise, that energy building up in your system can really disrupt the other healthy bodily functions.  If there\u2019s so much stored in your system you also have to be careful about not discharging all at once as that can be quite intense. Looking for support from experienced somatic experiencing practitioner may be a nice supplement to guide this type of process.",

The \u201cvoo\u201d breath might also be helpful if you wanna look that one up. It\u2019ll help to calm you but realize just calming and not releasing is still repressing.",

    "postText": "So I've known this girl for awhile, and I've had some sort of attraction to her (I don't believe it was a crush), and I feel like I did a good job of pushing her out of my head, but was surprised to find out that she and a close friend of mine, that I respect and also look up to, were dating. At first I didn't believe it, but then saw she was his wallpaper and believed it. It seems my heart had sunk when I heard it, but when dwelling upon it I want the both of them to be happy and have a long relationship, and now several hours after hearing of it I feel like I'm sort of jealous.\n\nIf anyone has experience or any advice for this situation and how to get through it would be much appreciated.",

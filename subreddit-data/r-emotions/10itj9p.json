    "postText": "Hi...I have difficulty feeling happy or living in the moment or feeling happy. I do experience happiness at times when I talk with my friends, which I don't do often, very rarely, because I don't have many friends, just one close friend and she's busy at all times, so we barely talk. I don't want my happiness to depend on her but seems like it's the case. I also feel happy when I make little surprises/gifts for her to make her days a little brighter and more fun, but overall I feel unsatisfied and sad, and anxious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat am trying to say is, I feel unsatisfied with life and lonely and scared of feeling happy, I know I don't need to feel happy all the time, but it's continuous sadness or no emotion, I have tried many other things to find satisfaction in life, like gaming used to make me happy, but not anymore, I have many games to play but I don't want to, I feel nervous and anxious, just because of stress that I have from the job search and thinking that I am not good at anything and I will never get a job that I want, even something to get my bills paid, I am afraid and all this makes me anxious and stressed. I feel on edge at all times, I feel like I need to keep searching for a job and if I relax or play games or watch videos or anything I will be punished, someone will scream at me.  \n\n\nOf course, there are times during the day I feel okay but the anxiety and stress come in at random times, and the rest of the day I can't relax until I go to sleep, which means I will end up punishing myself either by not eating or staying up late as long as possible.",

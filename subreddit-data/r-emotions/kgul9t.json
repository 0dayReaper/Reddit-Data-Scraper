Start by reflecting on your being, think about what makes you You, discover your passions and your mission in this life, and fall in love with that. Fall in Love with yourself First and then THAT love will find you, no need to spend a lifetime looking for it.\n\nI have experienced one sided love, it was quite interesting tbh, The idea of loving someone so deeply but not getting it back is pretty sad to say. An emerald green love, that's what i call it, It did find me in my lowest point, in my darkest days, and it helped me feel again, live again and love again. Although, it was painful, I tried to see the bright side of things, that one sided love, helped me reconsider my priorities and instead of always giving love to others, I shifted that and started focusing on myself and loving ME.\n\nMoral of the story, always look at the bright side of things and Fall in love with you to be able to love.",

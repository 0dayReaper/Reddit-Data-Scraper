    "postText": "Does anyone else ever get these waves of sadness for no explainable reason?? One second I\u2019m loving my life - happily might I add. the next, I\u2019m in a ball on my bed inconsolably crying. It comes in waves and usually passes usually doesn\u2019t last more than a few weeks to a month but I can\u2019t work, or function. I either sleep too much or not all or I can\u2019t bring myself to eat or I eat to the point of being sick. I cry and rage out - break things &amp; isolate from everything. then when I finally come out of the haze I\u2019m left to pick up with pieces. an apology spree, groveling for my job, etc etc. does anyone else experience this?? Is there a reason for it? There are no known triggers. No deaths, breakups, or anything overwhelming\u2026any insight would help.",

Doctors can check your hormonal levels pretty accurately before prescribing the right mix to get things evened out, if they seem out of whack. I guess there are other possibilities too, just seems like a good place to start so you understand what\u2019s actually happening in your system before medicating or taking something for it.",

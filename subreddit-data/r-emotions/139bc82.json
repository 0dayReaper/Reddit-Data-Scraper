    "postText": "# Heart Radiance\n\nThe importance of love within the confines of spiritual development cannot be overstated. It is one of the keys to the secrets of life. Loving from your heart centre is very much a needed endeavour in today\u2019s world in which can help the Spirit World in many different kinds of ways. One of the key things that I want you to take away from the Methods listed in regards to Heart Radiance is to continue to try using the methods until you can discern Loving Emotions and understand that ability to Create Emotions.\n\nI learned methods on how to love from a teacher of mine called Avadar at a young age. I had been able to discern spiritual colours in which upon searching the Internet as to answers as to what exactly I was viewing, I found an answer in which struck a chord within myself that let know that the colours I was viewing was potentially thar Karmic Spiritual Colour of Spiritual Entities around myself. He developed certain Teaching earlier on in his life in the late eighties and early nineties in which has been refined today in how to love.\n\nI believe these teachings have been taught before through various metaphysical teachers in the past not only within the confines of this physical earth but also on other planets within different dimensions. Where the power of love manifested through the layers upon layers of life to uplift generations and inspire the awareness of those touched by the lover. Some of these teachings on our planet may have been lost to time over the years only to reemerge within certain timeframes but some of it might have survived and certainly have been relearned to reveal these teachings today.\n\nLove is powerful enough though to break through the collective consciousness\u00a0in many different kinds ways, potentially the Spirit Realm giving us hints and clues as to one of the sacred things in life. Our experiences also give credence to some of the perceptions in which has emerged. The act of love itself has existed for near close to forever and relationships and bond created through those acts potentially remain to this day. It\u2019s augmented by the information coming out of the various psychic and spiritualist research happening today and in the past. Near Death Experience Research is one of those fields and just based off of scanning some of the Accounts I can say that there is let know of love and experiences of love within them in which points towards love being a secret to life in which in the Spirit Realm might not be as much of\u00a0 secret as it is on this Physical Earth Based Culture. Even within the Culture itself Love shines through into pop culture and societal perception in which is partially based off of the act of Falling in love. For some of those acts heart feelings manifest naturally and radiance amplified partially by way of the Spirit Around us. In which we can emulate in certain ways to be able to facilitate the emotion of Love daily.\n\nMy Teacher had labelled the Methods and Modes in which he came up with down here as Heart Chakra Radiance. HCR for short. I sometimes refer to it as Heart Radiance as I would discern a difference in regards to the Heart Chakra and that of the Emotion Centers within our Spiritual Bodies.\u00a0Either way what we are ultimately referring to for the most part is that of love.\n\nThe point of these Heart Radiance Methods is to learn how to love but you could certainly apply the methods in regards to other types of emotions and energies. The Modes of heart radiance are there to eventually allow someone to be able to love at will without visualizations, meditations, and/or intimacy. Where you would be able to create the emotion of love at will through the action of wilful projection and creation of Love from the Heart Center and potentially from other areas as well.\u00a0Where you would reach a point in your practice where you would be able to send love from the emotional body and centre at will and to then be able to use the actual emotion throughout everyday life.\n\nThe following are the methods of Heart Chakra Radiance(HCR). They were developed from my teacher Avadar early on in his life. Here is an excerpt from the website:\u00a0http://www.higherlightchurch.com/#HEART\n\n*\u201c****Mode 1****: While breathing normally, visualize a sphere of white energy in your\u00a0chest, or more specifically, in your Heart Chakra \u2013 the most important\u00a0chakra for spiritual growth. Then, without holding your breath,\u00a0visualize radiating white light out of this sphere in every*\u00a0direction at once. It is suggested that one first use this technique in light  \n*(alpha) meditation in order to become accustomed to it.*\n\n***Mode 2****: While visualizing Mode 1, program yourself simply through\u00a0desire to radiate those aspects of spiritual white light \u2013 called\u00a0\u00a0Programmed White Light \u2013 that would help you grow in the fastest\u00a0possible way. Once you start doing this, the improvement is immediate\u00a0and requires no new concentrated effort; you improve as you use it.*\n\n***Mode 3****: This is a natural evolution from the previous modes. Through*\u00a0the application of mode 2 it is eventually realized when the will alone is sufficient *to radiate: visualizing is no longer necessary because a\u00a0\u00a0certain degree of proficiency has been developed.*\n\n**Mode 4**: Because of the difficulty in visualizing this, this mode is not recommended\u00a0*until Mode 3 is performed fairly easily. With the Heart\u00a0\u00a0Chakra being the primary focus, radiate as you would from Mode 2 with\u00a0\u00a0all of the seven major chakras \u2013 all at the same time.\u201d*\n\nI have also developed my own modes in which I adapted off of Heart Chakra Radiance:\n\n**Mode 1** \u2013 I want you to try and visualize a white orb in your chest area. Envision this orb enveloping the area where your heart is and envision white light pulsing out of it. Just as you can use white light manifestations to defend yourself you can also use it to invoke a loving response. I advise using Heart Radiance in a meditative state during first attempts. If you are having difficulty with the above visualization, you can try envisioning white light radiating like a stream advancing from your heart outwards in a forward fashion rather. I initially used this alternate method with success.**Mode 2** \u2013 There is an emotional centre at the core of the emotional body which I believe usually overlaps the physical body. This emotional centre is often located near the heart chakra and is not only where you can feel emotions but also where you can create them. After a while of picturing pulsating white light, I want you to try and emanate love from your Emotional Centre. The visualizations are there to lead towards a loving response, but the envisioning alone is not what creates the emotion. A willful projection of that emotion may be needed in order to actually be creating that emotion. If you are having difficulty creating the emotion of love try to think back on the positive emotions that you have experienced in your life to try, pinpoint if you have felt love before and emulate how those emotions have felt by willfully creating them within your emotion centre.**Mode 3** \u2013 The emotions that you feel in your emotional centre is sometimes not your own. It is my understanding that spirits sometimes implant their own emotions within our own emotional core to elicit an emotional response and by the way you feel emotions it can feel like your own. Emotions that you feel without you willfully producing them may not be yours which is not to say that there aren\u2019t times when we present emotional responses in which can feel involuntary. Learning to control your emotions may be a part of this but I also feel the influencing of your emotion centre without fully recognizing this is happening at times in which those are naturally empathic are able to discern. Keep this in mind as you continue to learn how to create love out of your emotional centre. Practice until you are able to generate a loving feeling from your emotional core. You are looking for a warm fuzzy kind of feeling in your heart area. The emotion of love is what you are trying to achieve from this technique. If you have somebody you truly love in your life, not just the word or the idea, then use that to your advantage. Radiate towards that person in conjunction with the HCR methods. Emulate the Love you feel towards that person and harness that into daily emotional output. Through continued use, you will get to a point where you can radiate love at will without having to visualize or be in a meditative state. I am advocating for safety in regards to loving when you are driving or doing something in which needs concentration.**Mode 4** \u2013 Once the ability to feel the love develops and you start to understand how to invoke love more clearly, you can start to radiate different types of love. Compassion the emotion of loving care, Loving Happiness is sort of a joyous warmth, Humility being a type of selfless love, Inspiration being a motivational sort of Love, Sensual can be a pleasurable kind of love. All different kinds of emotions described can be utilized in many different kinds of ways that can lend towards emotional experimentation. The ability to feel the mechanisms in regards to emotional creation varies within each person and for some of us develop as you learn to create emotions. Through attempting these methods I feel there is a natural understanding from the spirit that you potentially want to pursue emotional creation. Stick with it for a couple weeks and I feel you will be able to create the emotion of Love daily by the end of that period. **Mode 5** \u2013 So we have been focusing more on the emotional core within the past four modes but I now want you to try and focus on your emotional body. So think of an egg as a metaphor in regards to the emotional body/core. The core is the yoke in which is usually located near your heart area and is where you predominantly feel the emotion and can create emotion. The body is like the egg white, usually overlapping your entire physical body, in which can be difficult to feel at first. You don\u2019t usually feel an emotion in your head or hands even though there is an emotional body overlapping the physical. Comparing the difference in what you feel emotionally between the core and body can vary. Keep in mind that I did not always know the emotional body existed before because I could not feel it clearly at first. I started to be able to feel the difference between the emotional body and core once I was able to differentiate between the core and body through emotional discernment and awareness. Loving from your emotional body can feel muted compared to loving from your core at times. This emotional body is difficult to feel at first but the same methods you used to achieve love within your emotional centre can be applied to your emotional body. Using the first four modes in the context of radiating love from the entire emotional body. Being able to love out of your hand or head area rather than just your chest/heart area. Keep practicing and I feel that you will be able to feel it and differentiate soon enough. This mode is to be attempted once you have a better understanding of what Heart Radiance is about. If you are still new to HR and are currently still working on the first four modes, don\u2019t be dissuaded if you are still having difficulty understanding. Personal Note: I would get to a point where I would be able to discern loving energies coming from my Chest area at times and I would be able to feel spiritual mechanisms and learn how to pulse emotions out of the area in which would turn into daily promotions of love. The visualization lead me to a point where I would start to understand the mechanics of creating emotions and being able to understand what exactly is the emotion of love. I would meditate with my hand over my head and my palms up in which I would visualize white energies coming through my hand areas while I would love through my heart centre. This would eventually become learned that I could apply the methods of creating love to other kinds of emotions like Joy and Sadness. I would become a Psychic-Medium after an emotional breakthrough. I would be able to feel different kinds of spiritual energies around myself in multiple kinds of ways. I would also learn that we can use love not only in regards to daily emotion output but also in regards to other kinds of energy promotions. Some of these energies would be described as psychic in nature but others could be considered everyday feelings like urges and vibes in which some of us experience daily without fully noting that these energies could be spiritual in nature as well as utilized in different ways others than feelings that we feel from them. For example, when you put on music there is sometimes vibes and protection that can be described as inspirational head and body energies. Urges are energies as well in which can feel more in front of the scenes kind of energies pointing towards the utilization of these energies from the spirit and by natural body mechanics. Both vibes and urges I would be able to discern and utilize the emotion of love in regards to these energy promotions but they wouldn\u2019t be the only ones.\n\nSo, there are many reasons why one should practice Heart Radiance.\n\nWhen one loves I feel they raise their karmic progress through the act of love.\u00a0 It potentially affects other dimensional afterlifes as well in which for the most part can be beneficial. Loving creates positive karma as it is considered a moral emotion by the light. This potentially gives you greater access to the light after death should you love daily. There are many reasons why higher light access can help a great many depending on what you decide to do with your life and there is nothing wrong with choosing your own way regardless. Those who love are potentially developing the strength and power of their own emotional centre/body through the use of Heart Radiance not to mention the benefits and impact it can have on the environment and atmospherics around you. Think of exercise in the physical and it strengthening the physical body and potentially the physical setting. The same idea can be applied emotionally and spiritually in regards to emotional creation especially in regards to that of love.\n\nYou are potentially healthier as a spiritual being who has this higher access to the light due to many variables and circumstances. Advanced sight and natural enlightenment are a small percentage of some of the benefits that you may experience from attaining higher light access. Imagine multiple kinds of surfaces to the light that by way of Karmic progression can give you access to plane levels located higher up, some in which are tethered to abilities manifested form garnering higher plane level access. Think of literally gaining to access to certain continents on Earth by way of positive karma through the act of love and morality in which upon gaining access to those continents also creates natural abilities by way of having access to those places. Both access and ability in certain dimensional existences is sometimes tethered both naturally and not so to the kinds of ethical actions and non-actions one presents. By way of being incarnate for some they streamline their karmic progression through acts of morality by way of karmic modifiers. Some of this has to do with the circumstances of one\u2019s own life and being incarnate presents certain kinds of variables to the Light in which can cause rapid progression upon loving and other kinds of actions. This creates opportunity to be able to increase ones own progression through acts of morality in which can then be utilized in many different ways. Imagine that by loving daily in the physical and other-dimensional that you could reach level of light and dimensions and as well as non-dimensions that would take quite more time and effort in trying to achieve that in certain areas in the Light.\n\nYour emotional awareness can become more heightened through the daily radiance of love and greater empathetic awareness in that you sometimes become more aware of the spiritual elements around you whether it happens through natural means or spiritual intervention. There are spiritual entities and guideships in which are aware of whether you would want to become more empathic or psychic in which the utilization of love can lend towards in multiple capacities. Don\u2019t let this deter from tloving daily though as I said there are those that understand how you would want to utilize the love you create and if you did not wish to be psychic it shouldn\u2019t create that kind of awareness in certain capacities. You will potentially become more aware though of your emotions through the use of Heart Radiance leading towards being able to tell the difference between implanted emotions from the spirit around yourself and that of willful emotional creation.\n\nRadiating love from the heart helps spirits on the other side in many different ways. Love can naturally attract those within the spirit who also love and can lead to all sorts of different relationships both in regards to the positive and the negative. Sending that love towards a spirit or incarnate can create an emotional bond and strengthen certain bonds that already exist. The strengthening of relationships through the act of positive emotional output I feel is very much a truth. You strengthen your relationships through the act of love. I feel that love also adds substance to a great many things behind the scenes. Lightworking and visualizations of white light can benefit from love in multiple capacities. Lending strength towards those visualizations both from spiritual facilitation as well as literal utilization of Love. In fact, there are multiple kinds of regular endeavours that benefit from Love. Spiritual attachment in regards to some of those actions that we do throughout life can lend towards the daily creation of Love. Intimacy benefits from love in a very literal way and discern the energies that you feel in your chest area upon pursuing intimacy and invoking life within those acts can create pleasurable experiences. Loving towards music is one of my favorite ways to use love. Just as loving can strengthen the setting and surrounding in regards to those places so can it help those that help facilitate those loving feelings in which some can make the case that music can be a facilitator of different kinds of energies like emotion. The music itself potentially caries a spirit of it\u2019s own in which will benefit from the use of Love. Heart song is one of the most beautiful ways to promote the emotion of Love.\n\nLoving towards your guides can create a closeness between you, specifically loving gratitude. The sacrifices that they make is deserved of loving appreciation. You can also do the same in regards physicals as well but I feel that most incarnate will not feel the emotions you send towards them in certain capacities but that they will potentially experience those emotions once they pass on depending on how they set it up pre-life and their are dimensional selves in which will potentially benefit from that emotional creation. Try to practice Heart Radiance as it will help with your spiritual health as well as your physical health. The closeness of a spiritual relationship benefits from love as it creates a bond that ties you together. You can feel relationships at times. You can feel the lifeforce through emotion at times. I feel that sending positive emotions to that person can help a relationship. This does not necessarily have to be intimate in nature. Platonic love exists, the love of friendship and family is very much real.\n\nLearning to send love from your emotional centre can be difficult specifically if you can not fully feel your emotions to a certain degree. Keep in mind that elements of the spirit realm like to sometimes suppress our emotions so that we can not clearly feel it at times, leading us to sometimes become dissuaded into not loving daily which ultimately can hinder karmic progression. There may be times when you love but are being suppressed to the point of not being able to feel that loving output. This works both ways though, there can also be times when you feel that love crystal clear which is an indication that spirits are amplifying your love. Continuing to practice with love, even through times where you cannot fully feel the emotions, is very much needed.\n\nMost people would be surprised to learn that a lot of their own emotions are being influenced by spiritual beings around them. Spirits can manipulate and exacerbate our own negative emotions and also do the same in regards to our positive emotions. They can provide constructive energies to provoke a positive emotional response just as they can do the same in regards to the negative. They like to pass off their emotions as our own at times. A great many of us just assume that it is always our own emotions we can feel during life but there is usually a duality. When there is a heated argument, a loving experience, times of sadness, even moments of sensuality those emotions we feel are partially from the spirits around us. So keep in mind that the emotions that you feel may not necessarily be your own. Example: We drop our favourite coffee mug and experience anger because of that. There are negative spirits hanging around us inciting that negative emotional response with their own emotions tricking us into thinking that we are angry. There are spirits who like to stoke the flames of our own negative emotions for a wide variety of reasons which is not always malicious in nature. So you may feel anger near your emotional core but that doesn\u2019t mean that you are the one who is actually creating that emotion. I feel it is more of a willful endeavour, not something that is necessarily passive. So while you may feel that you are presenting an angry emotional response you might actually just be feeling emotional implantation. There are many who do this to promote positive emotions of love, happiness, and other similar emotions too. It can be difficult to differentiate between implanted emotions and that of your own sometimes. When feelings get impressed upon you from spirits, it can feel like it is advancing from the perimeter of your emotional core or it can even feel like it is coming from your emotional center without you willfully projecting the emotion. Oftentimes it translates to being able to feel such emotion within the lower chest area and mistaking it for your own emotion.\n\nI feel that creating a journal in which to record the emotions you feel on a daily basis can be beneficial. So think about where you feel emotions and what kind of emotions you feel daily. Analyze your emotional output throughout the week, evaluate your own emotions and you may get you to the same conclusion that I have arrived at.\n\nThe aiming of your own emotions operates in unison with what you are intending to do. If you intend to love towards the person that is sitting next to you, then that is what potentially will happen depending on how you set it up pre-life as well as other variables. You can send love towards incarnates as well as spirits beyond.",

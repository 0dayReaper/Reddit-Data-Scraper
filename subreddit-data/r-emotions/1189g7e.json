You can try to fit in but if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. \n\nYou may all have experienced being real close with someone or a group but then as time passed by, there really isn't anything much to talk about anymore. \n\nI've been down recently realizing this reality as I've come to realize that I have these people that are not good for me.  And I know that sometimes it's hard because you have little to no support groups and life doesn't become easier. Yah, people come and people go BUT sometimes, it's really hard. \n\n\nSo QUESTION for all the people who can say that they found their group or core people. What are your advices and suggestions for the people who are currently in the situation? And if you may, can you give an estimated age when you find the core people in your life? (I noticed that not having much people at a certain age is really a big downer for some but I really hope we can conclude that finding a good environment for oneself can happen at any age and in whatever life stage one is in)",

    "postText": "When someone struggles with infertility, there is a playbook-of-sorts that our society follows in order navigate this carefully and to be aware of how this person may be feeling. I having a difficult time assigning emotions to the feelings that these playbook navigates around. Here is just one example of the playbook I\u2019m referencing- https://www.instagram.com/p/CpxAgjiB6Mv/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nFor example someone who struggles with infertility might \u201cfake a smile and congratulate someone on their pregnancy, then go cry\u201d - what emotion is this? Is this jealousy? Is this frustration with one\u2019s body? Is it sadness? All of the above? This is scenario one.\n\nThe real reason I am asking is actually the second scenario. I think I feel similarly whenever someone close to me shares career updates. \n\nSo here is Scenario two. My husband (33M) and I (32F) have similar career paths. We both graduated from the same college, work in tech, and have both been working the same amount of time. He is a software engineer and I\u2019m a product manager. He has worked for a great company for nine years and has gotten raises regularly (like 15% to 20% raises) and a promotion every 3-4 years which come with big pay bumps. \nI started working with startups so I have moved around every 3 years or so, and my pay has been fairly static for the past 7 years. Two to three times a year, when one of these promotion/raise events happen, my husband shares the news and expects me to be happy for him. I really struggle to share his excitement because it has been several years since I\u2019ve had a career update of my own. With his last promotion, he now gets a bonus each year that is more than my annual salary. Of course I am excited for him and we have semi-joint finances, but I\u2019m annoyed that we work similar hours, in similar careers and his earning potential has skyrocketed while mine is static. He\u2019s sees his raise as something that benefits both of us so I should be happy for him, but that is usually not what I feel, and he gets annoyed when I express anything other than pure excitement for him. I can\u2019t quite name the emotions, I\u2019m not jealous of his career - but I do wish I were further along in my career and I have a difficult time sharing in his excitement because of the things I want for myself. \n\nAre the feelings between these scenarios similar? Can someone help me name them? Is it reasonable to expect that someone who is sharing good news about a career update should be sensitive in how they approach that conversation to someone who is struggling in their career, in a similar way that someone who is pregnant is sensitive to someone who is struggling with infertility?\n\nOther maybe helpful context, I grew up in a very southern Baptist Christian upbringing where women didn\u2019t work or have careers, so I do see my career as more than just a way to make money and it is incredibly important to me.",

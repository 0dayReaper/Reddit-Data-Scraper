How amazing!\n\nEach color is part of an emotion.\n\nRemember that you don't control all the colors, but what you contribute to them and what you choose to focus on, is where your true beauty lies.\n\nit's important to remember this emoglyph isn't you, it's a photograph of a moment of you.\n\nYou can change it anytime you like in any way that you'd like.\n\nIt's not like your name.  It's more like an old dance you used to perform.\n\nRight now it's fresh and vogue.\n\nBut tomorrow, or a while away, it might not be anymore.\n\nDon't be embarassed by your own personal changes or growth.\n\nDon't be embarassed of who you used to be, or how you used to feel.\n\nYou're life is a song.\n\nSome people like discordance in their music.  But the mere fact that you have daily or yearly patterns as a living creature, means that your song, however it would sound: has a beat, and you can dance to it.\n\nSo never feel ugly.\n\n---------------------\n\nI knew what to color their emotions because I had them fill out this form.

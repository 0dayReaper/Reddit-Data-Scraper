    "postText": "Those who practice brutal honesty are excusing themselves for hurting others.\n\n* Long after the brutally honest have shared their \"truth,\" the recipient continues to feel the pain.\n* Brutally honest people may be unaware of the harm done by their words, or they may be giving themselves an easy out.\n* Practicing \"truth with compassion\" is a great way to speak a painful truth to another while respecting their feelings.\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202211/beware-brutal-honesty-it-may-be-sign-toxic-person](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202211/beware-brutal-honesty-it-may-be-sign-toxic-person)",

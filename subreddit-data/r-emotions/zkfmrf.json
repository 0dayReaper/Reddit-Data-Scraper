In fact, I tend to think that I am 2-3 years behind where I could be in life right now and it deeply saddens me. I wish I could change the past but all I can do now is keep moving forward. Too bad there aren\u2019t such things as a time  machine.",

What may seem like failures now are actually potential opportunities for even greater success. Stop dwelling on past mistakes and envision the future you want and take massive action every single day to achieve it.",

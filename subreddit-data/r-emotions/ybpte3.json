            "comment": "Yes, this is all a pretty telltale sign your system can\u2019t function with the stress it has experienced and stored now in the body.  What\u2019s stored in the body system in effect limits the emotional spectrum even to the point of depression (ultimate repression and inability for system to handle the energetic frequency of emotions.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t medical advice but try finding a somatic experience, internal family systems or other trauma informed practitioner.  You\u2019ll want someone with at least a higher degree of certification in these disciplines or with years of experiences with trauma specifically. \n\nThey may be available virtually or in your town dep where you live. \n\nSadly this pattern won\u2019t just go away as you\u2019ve experienced now over the years. It can last a lifetime without qualified help to reset the central nervous system. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to research go for it but don\u2019t mistake learning for actual support. The benefit of therapy is the specific tools therapists can offer you that self educating cannot.\n\nFeel welcomed to share your journey if you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re lucky to have a partner that understands you can explain you\u2019re going through a healing journey and it\u2019ll take time but progress is possible.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your response. It's interesting to learn about trauma from your perspective. My hunch is that my parents were quite dismissive, which prevented me from learning and expressing my emotions fully. \n\nEven though my father was lenient, he always had a loud voice in which I may not have felt comfortable expressing myself and being assertive (I have issues with this too).For as long as I can remember, I was always a quiet kid. However, I've never had any problems forming relationships with friends (secure in this regard). In intimate relationships, I tend to unconsciously disconnect (even though I'm comfortable being vulnerable, talking about myself). In my opinion, this disconnect is a strategy to avoid feeling safe / showing my true self. The same could apply to not being able to show my emotions, as I don't feel angry, excited, etc.\n\nI understand there is no simple solution, I do not mind returning to see a specialist as long as it is the right type. I've had both haptotheraphy (only practiced in the Netherlands) and traditional psychoanalysis, both of which have helped me with other issues. It sounds interesting to learn about IFS and somatic. Have you personally experienced it? I know there's EFT also.",

            "comment": "I'm way younger but in the same situation, trying to deal with it is hard because i have so many stereotypes i associate with people who express emotions it takes a long time to deconstruct especially since i'm still in the environement that made me this way. Feeling numb all the time gets exhausting. But then if i start feeling hapiness very deeply and expressing it, it'll be the same and even worse with negative emotions and i dont want to be vulnerable.",

                    "comment": "I'm with you there. There is something in being your true self, regardless of what you think of yourself. It took me time to really own up, reflect and be vulnerable but it does alleviate the stress of your own critical self-image.\n\nIt's great you're aware of it. Are able to speak to a specialist? Although its not a fix, meditation helps me to be aware of my feelings inside.",

So I repressed negative and positive emotions.\n\nI had a burn out and after I learned how to not get very negative emotions (by changing my mindsets) I felt more at rest. But I felt kind of plain because I still didn't feel happy.\n\n3 weeks ago I started dancing in a group of women. It's expressive dancing, translating music into any movement you want, nothing is weird. The first time was a bit awkward, but the second time I went I felt more free to just let go an let my body do it's thing it wants on the music. My mind was controlling my body less. And... and my body was happy!\n\nThe emotions where a bit overwhelming for me, but I didn't push them away, I just enjoyed them being there. I'm now on a track accepting happy, sensual, intimate emotions. And what is the best thing: I just can't stop smiling! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I think one of the happy hormones I made with the dancing causes smiling.\n\nExperiment by letting go of the control of all your emotions and feelings. If your gf touches you, close your eyes and feel  her energy flowing from her fingers into your body. Feel how she loves you with a single touch.\n\nAnd experiment in many different ways, so you learn more about yourself, how you think, how you feel and how you respond to the feeling. Being aware of all your thoughts, feelings and responses, finding patterns and find a way to correct your (thought) response to a better way.",

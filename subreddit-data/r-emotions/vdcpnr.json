I was suppose to have went Monday and Tues but I found out the pay period so ima go Fri and Sat so I can get paid next week than I'll have to wait 2 weeks. If I would've known that I would've went the other 2 days cuz I could've used the money but oh well, at least I'll have a lil something and hopefully I can get decent hours when the new location opens up so I can save up for whatever bike I wanna get\ud83d\ude14",

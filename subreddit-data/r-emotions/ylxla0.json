    "postText": " I need advice. I have this one classmate who is in all my classes and she will not leave me alone. She has attached herself to me and acts as my mother. Everyday I go to class she has to comment on something. Whether it\u2019s how I look, what I\u2019m wearing, asking if I did the assignment, asking me what I got on my tests and assignments, and on and on. She always says it in such a rude tone too. She is smart and always gets over 100% on her tests and she will literally shove her phone in my face with the scores she gets. Like I do not care. At all. If I don\u2019t show up for class, she will nonstop blow up my phone. Not even with concern either but just to be annoying and noisy. I can not handle this anymore. I feel so smothered and I have so much anxiety going to class everyday just because I\u2019m waiting on what she has to say that day. The other day she was putting me down because I said I took naps. In front of everyone she was making fun of me. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I just don\u2019t take it personally and just respond with a \u201cyeah..\u201d or ignore her. And we are in the same program so we\u2019ve been in the same classes for a year now and will be the rest of my time here which is about 3 more semesters.",

If not, maybe ask her to eat lunch together. Just say you want to get to know her better because you'll be in the same classes for 3 more semesters and you've noticed she gives you extra attention.\n\nAnd just see where it goes...\n\nUnusual behaviour is usually caused by somekind of trauma/stress. You're right to not take it personally, but you can set boundaries, give her feedback on her behaviour and what the consequenses of her behaviour are.\n\nAnd if you feel up to it, ask her what she needs or what she's missing that causes her to behave this way towards you.\n\nIt's hard to talk, but at the end you both are just two people who need to finish school some day and I hope you both can say you've had a great time learning stuff.",

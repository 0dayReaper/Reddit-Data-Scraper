If not, maybe ask her to eat lunch together. Just say you want to get to know her better because you'll be in the same classes for 3 more semesters and you've noticed she gives you extra attention.\n\nAnd just see where it goes...\n\nUnusual behaviour is usually caused by somekind of trauma/stress. You're right to not take it personally, but you can set boundaries, give her feedback on her behaviour and what the consequenses of her behaviour are.\n\nAnd if you feel up to it, ask her what she needs or what she's missing that causes her to behave this way towards you.\n\nIt's hard to talk, but at the end you both are just two people who need to finish school some day and I hope you both can say you've had a great time learning stuff.",

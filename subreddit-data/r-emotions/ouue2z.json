    "postText": "So I ( 21F )just realised how bad I am at wanting to share about the things that negatively affect me. I'm not a sad person, I'm not misunderstood or with dark secrets that make me cry myself to sleep everynight but like any human going through life, there are things that happen in my life that can make me quite sad. The kind of things that don't necessarily resolve themselves immediately. I'm quite an affectionate person and in social situations I tend to be the person who's termed as \" a good listener\", often I find people I barely know telling me the deepest things they battle with because, as they say, they ,\" Just feel comfortable around me.\"  I'm not trying to toot my own horn , I'm just quoting what I've heard said to me before and I love that people feel comfortable around me. This world is cold and if they can remember that one person who paid attention to their problems and was there for them then that's enough to make me smile.\n\nSo ,my problem is I don't understand how I can be so soft with people , wanting them to express themselves , confront their trauma and fall head over heels in love if they can, yet not allow myself the same luxury. When people reveal touchy -feely emotions toward me , it makes me squirm even though Ik wholeheartedly that they're serious. I cringe at the thought of sharing the most intimate parts of me that get me down from time to time. I can't bare the thought of revealing myself like that . Maybe I subconsciously aspiring to stoicism . Ik this is not healthy. Ik there are probably people who would want to hear about what's bothering me. I seem to attach to one person at a time to trust to be my confidant but even then I feel whiny ( even tho some of them have repeatedly reassured me that they are there for me). There are times I've tried explaining things that bother me in a session on honesty between friends but I find , I get talked over( and I'm not shy or quiet. I'm quite extroverted).\n\nI'm trying to get into therapy to deal with my unresolved trauma but Ik it's also important to have a good support system. It's just that it's like I can't allow myself to. I guess I wanna know is there anyone who has a similar experience, or is there anyone who can offer their two cents as to why I'm like this?",

I was only there to support her and be abused by her. So I got good at that part, and terribly at sharing myself. 15 year of training will do that. \n\nI'm glad you're looking for a therapist - they will help you find the little ways to practice sharing yourself, thing things you can do to get more comfortable, while also working through the root of your trauma. That process is where the real change happens.",

            "comment": "You can try and do a self reflection. What values/beliefs do you have and what do you think about yourself when you would talk about emotions to others?\n\nThe thing is, talking about emotions is trying to make sense of them. We don't get a user manual at birth. So we tend to talk to others and try to make sense why we think the way we think, feel the way we feel and act the way we do.\n\nThat's what philosophy is all about getting that wisdom in understanding ourself so we can live in emotional peace.\n\nYour mindset concerning talking about emotions (and thoughts and behaviour) should be that it's about learning about yourself and personal growth.\n\nTrust can be hard, I realise, but you probably know wise people too, they'll understand you and are great to talk to.",

            "comment": "Very similar experience here, male 50. It\u2019s a trust issue. Formative family experience of parents being unwilling to \u2018hear\u2019 expressions of unhappiness, anger or \u2018negativity\u2019 is typical. We learn to hide some of our feelings like we learn to hide parts of our bodies. Some people turn that experience of internalised hurt into anger and a desire to control, others into empathy and a desire to comfort and soothe. It\u2019s fairly common amongst therapists.  \nIt would take a particularly empathic and trustworthy person for you to feel able to open up to. A mirror of yourself. Meanwhile, since it\u2019s only feelings that are the problem and they\u2019re physical sensations caused by the abdominal brain, can I suggest you look at abdominal massage/visceral manipulation? Soothe unhappy feelings at their source. Many Osteopaths learn the Barral technique although not many of them realise its potency as an emotional stress reliever.",

He would sulk when we expressed our frustration with him and switch the blame to us like it's our fault for being offended. That might really have been the start of this.",

Children instinctively look to parents and older siblings to understand their place in the family and how to \u2018fit in\u2019. \n\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t have the life experience then to realise that parents are flawed people who often get things wrong. By the time we\u2019re old enough to see them more objectively the patterns of belief are well entrenched.",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t understand for the life of me how some people can be so intelligent, yet never use their intelligence to become more emotionally intelligent. You can know someone capable of high complexity tasks similar to a computer or have a masters degree or phd etc, who is still emotionally a child. Is it compartmentalization? Is it that emotions are so invalidated in society &amp; suppressed? I think it\u2019s also bc sometimes people are emotionally selfish- they\u2019d rather not do any work on themselves so they don\u2019t. Society doesn\u2019t force them to perform emotionally like it forces them to perform in other ways. What are your thoughts &amp; insights?",

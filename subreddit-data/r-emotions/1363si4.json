I wonder if these are the reasons.\n\nDoes anyone here experience something similar? How do you cope with people who worry that you aren\u2019t showing excitement?",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for sharing this! Good question and I can kind of relate as I\u2019ve lived most of my life away from a family I really do love being around. I think the easiest way for me to reason this in my own mind is: they have the support of each other and notice they are missing you, their lives are prob very similar from day to day and when you\u2019re not there, they have more a feeling of loss or missing. But you are creating an entire life somewhere, and are responsible for many items, circumstances, forward movement (rather than things staying the same.) So, it\u2019s natural you have more on your plate for the future and less on your mind from the past, even though of course you love them and will be happy to see them the next time it\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s rather normal for someone becoming independent, and can see it as a healthy balance. Does that help?",

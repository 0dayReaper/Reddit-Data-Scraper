Anxiety, for example, is typically felt around the midpoint of the liver.  \nThese feelings are triggered by memories because the solar plexus (gut brain) can\u2019t tell the difference between a present situation and a memory. It\u2019s like a security guard looking at a cctv monitor and pressing an alarm button, not knowing if the footage is live or recorded.  \n\nThere are two therapies I\u2019ve studied that don\u2019t involve reliving past trauma; one is the Human Givens \u2018Rewind\u2019 technique to desensitise and take control of bad memories \n\nhttps://www.hgi.org.uk/useful-information/treatment-dealing-ptsd-trauma-phobias/rewind-technique  \n\nThe other is purely physical (which includes emotional), the Osteopathic Barral technique of massaging the muscles that the solar plexus uses to produce our emotions, releasing long held stress there and allowing old emotional states to \u2018let go.\u2019  \nNot all osteopaths do this so you\u2019d have to find one that does and specifically uses it for stress.   \n\nSelf massage of the abdomen is also an effective way to release held emotional stress (which is all muscular tension).",

Still thanks for the resources! xD I can definitely use those\n\nWhat I was curious about- is that how normal memory is supposed to work? Is it normal to remember only a few selected fun moments when thinking about a nearly entirely sad day? I was in a good mood when doing that though\u2026 does that explain it???",

I\u2019m mainly here to make sure that I\u2019m not overthinking :/ like, maybe is IS how people are supposed to function and I\u2019m exaggerating\u2026 or reading into it too much.\nWelp",

To live in an ongoing deeply dissociated state isn\u2019t healthy for the being but then again, it\u2019s the body\u2019s way to cope with not being able to process what\u2019s worse (reliving the stress of the original experiences). Trauma trained specialists can be very helpful here if that\u2019s indeed what\u2019s going on. Not medical advice and def not aware of all the circumstances or conditions that can lead to amnesia.",

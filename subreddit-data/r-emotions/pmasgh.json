    "postText": "Hi! I (16, he/him) recently experienced something weird. I was listening to music and humming along, not really doing anything when, out of nowhere, I felt this great anger boiling up. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced nothing today that would trigger this, and the feeling stayed for a little while. I even said out loud that it came out of nowhere and was very unnecessary, but the only thing that helped were the things I do when I have anxiety attacks. (Lay on the floor, fidget with chains or rope) \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what happened?\n\nI\u2019m not on any medication and have an anxiety disorder, if knowing helps.",

I think you should talk to someone about it, to help you better sort through these stupid emotions .. you can always talk to me (. \u275b \u1d17 \u275b.) Maybe You will feel more comfortable since I can relate? Anyways, I hope you're feeling better!",

    "postText": "Do emotions have a reason? People seem to be unreasonable creatures that feel random emotions depending on their hormone levels at a current moment and then rationalize those emotions afterwards. Is it possible that we feel certain emotions as a result of our experiences, incidents etc.? Can we explain our emotions by the facts that caused them or is it just a veiled way to explain our thoughts instead of emotions?",

They are not directly caused by a situation. \n\nI agree that different people can perceive a situation differently. \n\nLet's say Alice and Bob are in the same situation. Alice describes her emotions and Bob asks why she felt so and so. Alice explains it, so that Bob can now understand Alice's needs better and improve his actions. It's beneficial, but another question comes to my mind now: does Bob understand why Alice perceives the situation in this and this way? Is it possible to understand it? Throughout my life I always thought that I cannot understand such things and I assumed it's impossible at all for anyone (so nobody can understand others), but I might be wrong about it and maybe somebody else can understand other people's feelings?",

    "postText": "Are humans inherently selfish? Do we do things that only serve a purpose/need/want for us? Even when we do things for others and care for them, is it only because it makes us feel good about ourselves, or is there something more, that encourages those actions? \n\nI personally, have always had a belief that we are born with a certain level of empathy, which exists without a need to satisfy ourselves or feel good about ourselves. That ability may vary as we grow, based on how it was allowed to develop.\n\n What do you guys feel about this?",

            "comment": "We are social animals that have thrived on cooperation throughout our evolution.   \nIndividually we were weak and vulnerable to predators, as a group we were capable of defending each other and even driving predators away from their kills to steal meat.   \nWe needed empathy in order to understand how our actions affect others and how to maintain close bonds with our group members. Our literal survival depended on it.   \nCaring for others\u2019 needs ensured our place in the group, which enabled us to survive.  \nThese innate instincts are still with us today, in our much more complex societies, where the daily need to find food and avoid predators is much less simple.   \nSelfishness and an inability to feel empathy and express kindness would have made an individual unacceptable to a group or tribe in our earlier evolution, right up until farming became established, probably, and predators diminished. Now it\u2019s possible to be highly selfish and even psychopathic because survival no longer depends on being part of a small, close knit, cooperative community.",

            "comment": "We are social animals that have thrived on cooperation throughout our evolution.   \nIndividually we were weak and vulnerable to predators, as a group we were capable of defending each other and even driving predators away from their kills to steal meat.   \nWe needed empathy in order to understand how our actions affect others and how to maintain close bonds with our group members. Our literal survival depended on it.   \nCaring for others\u2019 needs ensured our place in the group, which enabled us to survive.  \nThese innate instincts are still with us today, in our much more complex societies, where the daily need to find food and avoid predators is much less simple.   \nSelfishness and an inability to feel empathy and express kindness would have made an individual unacceptable to a group or tribe in our earlier evolution, right up until farming became established, probably, and predators diminished. Now it\u2019s possible to be highly selfish and even psychopathic because survival no longer depends on being part of a small, close knit, cooperative community.",

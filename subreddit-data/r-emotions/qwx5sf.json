    "postText": "I wasn't taught how to handle my emotions as a child, or express them properly. It has turned me into a menace as an adult and I only recently learned this when I received peer evals. I have a very short temper, and I get upset easily. If there is any type of situation that requires a response, I'm very quick to strongly respond with my emotions. Does anyone struggle with the same thing or have tips on how to combat this? I had a therapist for a very long time but she left the practice so I'm currently not seeing anyone but i never felt like it was constructive in this aspect.",

It's a good start that you're reaching out about it and doing your own research. I highly recommend you begin a discipline of just working at it a bit every day. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "I always feel uncomfortable when people celebrate me, or pay a lot of attention to me, praise me, or say they\u2019re proud of me (this one especially). I know that they obviously have good intentions, but for some reason I constantly seek validation and then feel uncomfortable when it\u2019s given to me?? I have no idea where this comes from. It\u2019s like, if my friend tells me she\u2019s proud of me for something, I immediately like close up and cringe and feel so uncomfortable and pretend that I\u2019m thankful when I just feel awkward with the spotlight on me. Like, maybe I don\u2019t feel proud of myself? But sometimes I am proud of myself and praise still feels weird. Like I don\u2019t really believe them when they say it, and it just seems like a weird mask they put on because it\u2019s what society deems \u201cgood to do\u201d in that situation. What the hell is this feeling? Why do I have it?? Does anyone experience the same thing? IDK I\u2019m just in my head at 3 am so lol :) thanks for reading.",

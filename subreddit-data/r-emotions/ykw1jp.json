You can\u2019t take it anymore. All you want to do is run away and scream. Everything feels so hard, even the simplest things like getting out of bed and taking a shower or even making breakfast and eating. Whatever the reason, you need to know that you are not alone. Everyone has experienced this at some point in their life. Like life is \u201ctoo much to handle\u201d. And that\u2019s okay. There are many reasons why you feel this way, but know that there are also many ways to overcome this feeling and enjoy your life.",

    "postText": "I just lost a job I loved. I was a seasonal and they didn't want to keep me after that. I'm ok with that, but the realisation that I won't be able to connect with people who REALLY understand me is sad.\n\nBut I'm trying to stay positive : I don't feel anger, and I'm thankful for that. \n\nI felt anger for 6 months after a major event where I could've died, a girl could've been raped and where I got almost suspended because I blowed the whistle on the guy who was gonna do it. \n\nIn december another major event (for me) made me forget about anger and only feel love  and happyness. \n\nAnd now, since I've lost the job I loved so much, I'm pretty sad. It's not a depression. It's just sadness.",

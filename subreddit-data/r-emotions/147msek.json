            "comment": "Hey there. Thank you so much for posting this. It\u2019s very courageous of you to share, and I think a lot of people will learn from this.\n\nFirst, you are very intuitive and connected, which is a really great start. Definitely acknowledging and honoring you for your communication, patience in writing this, your organization, and the maturity that you are pursuing this with.\n\nAnger is connected to our defensive mechanisms, to supercharge us with energy when we feel threatened. This extra energy gives us the power to defend ourselves, and our boundaries, in the case of physical or non-physical attack.\n\nAnger is also connected to our other emotions which are unexpressed or suppressed. Anger is like a catchall emotion, which helps galvanize other stuck emotions, super charging it to express outward finally.\n\nIt is understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by people who might not be as mature as you. This is kind of a fact of life, but it doesn\u2019t have to determine how you spend your time or who you spend your time with. Of course we are somehow stuck with family until we\u2019re old enough to be on our own, but there is work you can do that I think might help you find your answers.\n\nKeep in mind, the purpose of anger isn\u2019t to manipulate others into behaving in a certain way. It is to keep, defend, express your integrity. If you find yourself going towards manipulative behaviors because others won\u2019t do what you want them to do, do your best not to go into more manipulation towards a particular result. \n\nThe point here is that you want to be respected, honored and seen for your human experience, treated with understanding in your social circles (fam, friends, peers, etc.)\n\nWhile you may be small in stature, feminine, young, not strong, etc, it does not have to be the case that you are not respected. \n\nOne of the most powerful people I know, is what many would consider short, and not physically strong. But her stand, for her integrity and dignity is powerful as soon as she enters a room, you can feel it.\n\nYou may want to look into boundary work, attachment theory, Hawkins power vs. force (takeaway concepts), and you may want to try martial arts as a way to physically defend yourself if you do feel threatened but equally important - so your body can FEEL powerful and the signal for dignity and strength becomes embodied. \n\nWhatever work you can do in embodiment, grounding, tai chi or qi gong may also help your body to begin physically representing your genuine connection to self-power (even if you aren\u2019t building muscle per se.)\n\nOne reason others treat you the way they do is because they can sense your frustration, sensations of feeling pathetic or defeated. If you learn to stand in your truth, powerfully, not forcefully, others will respond to it or they won\u2019t, but you will navigate towards those that do and know who\u2019s good for you. Life will get easier in this sense. \n\nHope this helps!",

                    "comment": "You are right on everything, I have read this comment more than once. I was thinking about my problem all day and I think it is simply disrespect from others, but you know, almost everyone I know behaves like this to me. I also thought about what you said, that others might sense what I feel about myself, and it is true sometimes, I believe. It's hard to stop giving that vibe though when I actually feel like I'm helpless. \n\nI don't know I just want people to stop laughing when the situation is not funny and I don't even act funny in a way to be made fun of, they simply laugh for no reason because they know I can do nothing. This became a rant. Thank you for the answer and thank you for taking the time to write it. I'll check the things you told me to learn about",

The great thing is, once you find some progress or start feeling yourself embodying this confidence it will apply to all areas of life. Totally worth the investment of time and energy to feel your own integrity and dignity. Good for you for honoring yourself and seeking support and answers in the first place.",

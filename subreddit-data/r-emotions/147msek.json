    "postText": "If we don't have a \"threat\" which they are \"afraid\" of, then why would our anger be something important for them? \n\nIf they are not afraid of physical violence from us, or from us abandoning them, or us doing something that they don't want us to do, then why would they care about our anger? About our argument. \n\nDuring the argument people don't care and ignore you since your anger causes nothing to them. After the argument no one cares about how angry you are since nothing is going to change for them.\n\nWhat is our \"threat\" when we are physically weaker or have nothing to punish them with? What is the punishment of anger which people are afraid of? \n\nHow can I make people respect my anger if they are not going to lose something if I get angry? What do I make them lose?\n\nMy problem is,\n\n1. First, I am a woman: I am physically weaker. This already makes me feel weak in every arguement. \n\n2. Acting angry as a threat: Even if I try ghosting them, ignoring them by not speaking to them just like \"angry people do\", at the end they ignore me too if they don't care enough, so I end up losing people for no reason. \n\n3. Holding a grudge as a threat: I don't get angry for long, nor do I hate people or hold grudges. They know I don't hold grudges, and after a few days after the argument I am cool again, not angry. They know this and so they take advantage of it. They know I will forget it and so they don't care about what we argued for.\n\n4. Punishing as a threat: Let's say that we are going somewhere but I don't want to go there. I say no. They say yes. I insist, they don't change their minds. Most I can do is leave them. I'll say \"I'm not coming then\" and I get off the car let's say, or turn away. They will let me leave, they don't need me. Even if they want me to stay and I leave, they are going to get used to it after a few times of me doing that, and at the end they will be indifferent to whether I stay or not. \n\n5. Let's say my brother doesn't lower the volume of the TV and I can't sleep. How do I make him turn it down? I can't use physical violence, I can't persuade him. Even if I start screaming, he will not change his mind. Therefore what is something to be afraid of?? He knows I will be cool after some hours so we will be having fun again, he knows he has nothing to lose.\n\n6. (Let's say I want to impose my opinion or my choice for something on someone. They still have nothing to lose if they don't listen to me. Are they going to feel bad because I don't like what we chose? No they're not.)\n\n7. Hurting people so that they are afraid: Hurting people during an argument might make them afraid of you indeed, but you must be smart in how you offend them so that they feel bad enough (sounds toxic) every time. This is indeed toxic and since no one is gonna care about the fact that you are simply angry, you must make them feel bad about themselves. This is going to push people away, plus, it is against your ethics. My ethics don't allow me to insult someone seriously as angry as might be. Therefore people are not afraid of words.\n\n8. Screaming as a threat: Screaming is not going to lead anywhere. I am simply going to be annoying or yell at them on my own. Last time I did this, they knew I don't have a real threat, therefore they just laughed and ignored me. Again did not do what I want. \n\n9. Setting boundaries: Boundaries can be easily broken. How do I threaten people so that they don't break them? What are they going to be afraid of if they break them? I cannot set boundaries\n\n\nThere is no way for me to feel powerful. I am simply a weak person. People do me wrong and I can't do anything about it. I don't understand what anger is for. Why do people care if someone is angry? I care because I might lose a friend, but they know I am not going to be lost so they take advantage of it. I don't want to cut people off. I simply want to solve the issue. But sometimes we must argue with anger. And they don't take me seriously.\n\nFor example I told my friend today (who did something that I did not like at all) that she is not actually a friend of mine along with other stuff during arguing. She used to be afraid of me abandoning her, but I calmed her down the last time she told me she is afraid of it, and now was the first time that she did not care at all and did not even reply, in fact she laughed and talked to some other girls nearby. The girls also heard the arguing and were laughing (they always laugh at the two of us even though it's serious). Then I came home and told my mother what happened, and she laughed and made fun of me, said \"of course she would not answer and ignore you. We know your anger is nothing, it's funny at this point. Nothing happens, it's just funny. No one cares\". \n\nI am weak and helpless. I don't know how to stop people from hurting me when they are simply not afraid of me.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thank you so much for posting this. It\u2019s very courageous of you to share, and I think a lot of people will learn from this.\n\nFirst, you are very intuitive and connected, which is a really great start. Definitely acknowledging and honoring you for your communication, patience in writing this, your organization, and the maturity that you are pursuing this with.\n\nAnger is connected to our defensive mechanisms, to supercharge us with energy when we feel threatened. This extra energy gives us the power to defend ourselves, and our boundaries, in the case of physical or non-physical attack.\n\nAnger is also connected to our other emotions which are unexpressed or suppressed. Anger is like a catchall emotion, which helps galvanize other stuck emotions, super charging it to express outward finally.\n\nIt is understandable that you\u2019re frustrated by people who might not be as mature as you. This is kind of a fact of life, but it doesn\u2019t have to determine how you spend your time or who you spend your time with. Of course we are somehow stuck with family until we\u2019re old enough to be on our own, but there is work you can do that I think might help you find your answers.\n\nKeep in mind, the purpose of anger isn\u2019t to manipulate others into behaving in a certain way. It is to keep, defend, express your integrity. If you find yourself going towards manipulative behaviors because others won\u2019t do what you want them to do, do your best not to go into more manipulation towards a particular result. \n\nThe point here is that you want to be respected, honored and seen for your human experience, treated with understanding in your social circles (fam, friends, peers, etc.)\n\nWhile you may be small in stature, feminine, young, not strong, etc, it does not have to be the case that you are not respected. \n\nOne of the most powerful people I know, is what many would consider short, and not physically strong. But her stand, for her integrity and dignity is powerful as soon as she enters a room, you can feel it.\n\nYou may want to look into boundary work, attachment theory, Hawkins power vs. force (takeaway concepts), and you may want to try martial arts as a way to physically defend yourself if you do feel threatened but equally important - so your body can FEEL powerful and the signal for dignity and strength becomes embodied. \n\nWhatever work you can do in embodiment, grounding, tai chi or qi gong may also help your body to begin physically representing your genuine connection to self-power (even if you aren\u2019t building muscle per se.)\n\nOne reason others treat you the way they do is because they can sense your frustration, sensations of feeling pathetic or defeated. If you learn to stand in your truth, powerfully, not forcefully, others will respond to it or they won\u2019t, but you will navigate towards those that do and know who\u2019s good for you. Life will get easier in this sense. \n\nHope this helps!",

I was thinking about my problem all day and I think it is simply disrespect from others, but you know, almost everyone I know behaves like this to me. I also thought about what you said, that others might sense what I feel about myself, and it is true sometimes, I believe. It's hard to stop giving that vibe though when I actually feel like I'm helpless. \n\nI don't know I just want people to stop laughing when the situation is not funny and I don't even act funny in a way to be made fun of, they simply laugh for no reason because they know I can do nothing. This became a rant. Thank you for the answer and thank you for taking the time to write it. I'll check the things you told me to learn about",

The great thing is, once you find some progress or start feeling yourself embodying this confidence it will apply to all areas of life. Totally worth the investment of time and energy to feel your own integrity and dignity. Good for you for honoring yourself and seeking support and answers in the first place.",

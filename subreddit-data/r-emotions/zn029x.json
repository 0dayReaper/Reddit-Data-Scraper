    "postText": "I get this certain feeling or \"vibe\" (I like it call it) that only appears for short amount of time (moments, minutes, or hours... but usually when you go to sleep and wake up, the vibe is reset and you feel back to 'normal'). They mostly happen after a dream or certain situation, such as around the holidays or a certain place you're at. These feelings occured more when I was a kid when I wasn't worried about the many problems of life\u2014they occur very rarely now. Each vibe that I get is different and represents a situation as said above. Also, it's not an emotion, however, vibes can bring different emotions with it such as happiness if the situation is a happy one. For example, a \"dark\" vibe (as I call it) is a bad one and usually occurs after watching a horror movie or experiencing a 'dark' situation, like a murder. This vibe comes along with a feeling of being scared or sad. A \"weird\" one may occur after experiencing something weird, or watching weird animations on YouTube for example. This feeling can make you feel insecure or anxious. A good vibe, such as a \"magical/holiday\" vibe for example, might be because you're visiting your family for the holidays, it's snowing outside, you're under the Northern Lights, and everywhere you look there's Christmas decorations. This brings an emotion of happiness or excitement, along with that particular vibe of a Christmas or magical feeling as well.\n\nLike I said, every \"vibe\" feels different, but different than an emotion. They can be described as mysterious, and I don't believe that everyone gets them\u2014some people know what I mean and can explain it well, while others say that they only can feel emotions alone without ever experiencing these \"vibes\". They also feel more spiritual in my opinion and more spacious than an emotion alone.\n\nI really want to know if there's a name for these feelings, where I can learn more about them, and if anyone else experiences them too. You can call me crazy lol.... but for the people who actually know what I'm talking about, I'm really curious to know more about them.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for sharing. Often wondered about this myself. My only explanation is, I\u2019ve discovered that (although I don\u2019t believe 100% in astrology) we can be moved into resonance of different frequencies which you can feel when considering lunar or other gravitational alignments (but isn\u2019t inherently emotion.) You may also consider each day is different and sometimes your central nervous system is \u2018tuned\u2019 in a specific way to feel with more capacity. When relaxed, safe, etc. the vibe can be quite noticeable as you said, again although not inherently emotion. Other systems in our body are resonating and flowing with each other as well, circulatory, etc. so it could be an interesting phenomenon of what happens when these tune with each other. (That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve gotten!) Would be happy to hear from others or if you find your answer.",

            "comment": "Your description was very accurate. do you mind if I save your post? also, can i DM you?\n\nI call them High Order Feeling (HOF), because they cannot be simply defined as the ordinary emotions. They are sometime a mix of different sub-affects.\n\nI don't know of another name and I don't know of any study, article, book that deals with it. if you know, please let me know. But I find it peculiar, that never in history does this seem to have been properly documented. Not even in literary works... Emotions are not properly linked, as emotions can occur in parallel, without interfering with the HOF. I don't think they are emotions, and probrably their source is not the amygdala. \n\nDo you feel any limbic system response to this ? Like hearth rate, adrenaline ? I sometimes feel this too. What means its probably takes the same neural paths emotions takes. According to the most accepted theory, on path is botton-up to the counsciouness in the frontal cortex, and other is top-down, to our body autonomic response. \n\nThis mean, probably another structure in the brain is responsible for this. But it behaves very similarly to emotions, in fact. They have valence, negative and positive, short duration. But unlike emotions, it doesn't seem to have a definite adaptive function. Do you think this might have an adaptive function? Because, if not, it could be a mutation, something that evolutionarily we shouldn't experience, since it doesn't bring any practical benefits.\n\n\nThere are also two possibilities. The inhibition pathway is not working enough to block these affects, which have no function and overload the conscience... In this case, you (like me) must have a weak inhibitory system, for some reason, like trauma, sickness. Creative people are like that. Too many intrusive thoughts. Ideas. etc... \nThe inhibitory system can vary according to the moment, stress, etc... It is more or less functional sometimes. Do you realize that sometimes there is a \"bigger leak\" from these HOF? at other times it is more barred ? You feel some days, and not others ?  It probably has something to do with the functionality of your inhibitory system. that you more or less consciously control. You relax and allow the affects to take over your cortex and your conscience. And sometimes you block that neural pathway.\n\nAnother possibility, and the most unlikely one, is that there are, in fact, unusual chemical reactions. Unlike Adrenaline. Noradrenaline, Dopamine, GABA, Oxytocin, etc... And this substance would reach consciousness and be perceived that way, in the form of these weird feelings and emotions. In fact, the combination of these chemicals. As in the RGB system, from two or three substances, a combination is made that generates an enormous amount of totally different information that is encoded by the neurons. Possibly this is what happens.\n\nBut that means we would have to have a sensory organ inside our brain. as well as smell, sight... a specific organ, with specific cells specialized in transducing these substance combinations into sensory and perceptive experiences. Something like this is almost unimaginable to think about... It would be the legitimate sixth sense. And once we experience it as a sense, we consciously perceive it... apparently it's not impossible and I believe  that may have cells specialized in this. They just needed to be discovered.\n\n\nSorry if I went on too long...\nI'm a crazy self-taught amateur theoretical scientist trying to understand this phenomenon during the dawn :) I am currently unemployed and without a social life :(",

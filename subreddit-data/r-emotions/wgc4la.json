    "postText": "Hi guys, just a question regarding being out of touch of your emotions/feelings\n\nI'm a 19M so I'm not sure if this is normal or not\n\nI've noticed recently that I have become very cold and emotionless - I don't really feel joy in things anymore, like seeing a movie, I just feel numb after the film, not positive or negative, just neutral. I can say I enjoyed it but that actual feeling just isn't there. The same goes for playing old video games, seeing friends, meeting peoples pets etc\n\nThe same goes for negative stuff - I don't seem to feel much when someone is telling me about something bad that has happened to them or even thinking back to bad things that have happened to myself, seeing things on the news or being involved in something. I had an incident where a guy got very angry at myself and a friend for parking on a street and it meant he had to park in a different spot, he was pretty irate but I just didn't feel anything during or after it all happened, kinda just meh\n\nEven as far as attraction - for some reason I don't feel physical attraction towards others anymore? I can see a very attractive person and think to myself they are good looking, dress well or whatever but I don't actually feel the attraction?\n\nIt's just a completely emotionless responce, I guess I'd sum it up as I simply don't care? Any idea wtf I'm talking about? Is it weird? I'm so confused",

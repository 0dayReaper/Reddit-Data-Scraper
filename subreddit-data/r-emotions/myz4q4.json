    "postText": "I cohost a podcast about emotions. We randomly pick a different emotion each episode and talk about what inspires or is inspired by that emotion. I don't know if that's something this group would be interested in but I figured I would throw it out there. We also have a what do listeners think segment that I would love to bring to this page if people are interested.\n\n[Feel Feelings with Danny and George](https://anchor.fm/feelfeelings)",

Current situation, I'm a supervisor and learning to become a better leader and boss, and someone who I attempted to guide and look out for, said vicious things to me while I tried to talk to her for being disrespectful to me. I feel like a failure. And that I've been betrayed.",

My emotional resilience was lower. I couldn't logically tell myself to stay cool.\n\nIt was the moment when my mammel brain (limbic system) was taking control because I had to much adrenalin in my body.\n\nMake a stress thermometer for yourself. When do you feel physically, mentally and emotionally on different fases of stress.\n\nFor example emotionally:\n\n- No stress - Emotionally resilient / at peace\n- Low stress - More emotional than usual\n- Medium stress - Nobody seems to understand my emotions\n- High stress - Crying all the time\n\nPhysically you might get tense shoulders, breath shallow, higher heart rate, problems eating, bowl problems.\n\nMentally the signs can be things like no concentration, forgetting things, hard finding words, quickly tired.\n\nThe only thing that helps is rest, not worrying and not wanting to much. You've got to give yourself (your body) a break.\n\nAnd I tell you from experience, you don't want to get into a burn out. It is taking me 2 years to recover already.",

    "postText": "I am someone that cries a lot. I cry when I get yelled at, when I get criticism, when a movie is sad, when I fail at things (even small things), and when I\u2019m sad over things that are probably trivial. I don\u2019t mean to cry, I don\u2019t cry because what I\u2019m feeling is so overwhelming I have to cry, I just kind of cry. I feel like it takes weight off of when I cry because of real pain and makes all of my tears less meaningful. I don\u2019t want to be that overly emotional sensitive person that cries all the time, how do I stop?",

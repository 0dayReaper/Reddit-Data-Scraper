Compensation: $25 Amazon gift card. You don\u2019t have to turn on your camera if you don\u2019t want to. No scam, no data collection, no private questions. You can skip any question you don't feel comfortable answering.\n\n**Eligibility:** 21+, living in the US, having emotional issues (or suspecting having them).\n\n**Link:** Please send me a DM or chat message to schedule a Zoom or Skype appointment.\n\n**Study Goal:** Understanding the clients\u2019 expectations from such a product. Understanding what they are willing to pay for and what doesn\u2019t seem interesting.\n\n**Questions?:** If you have any questions, please send me a DM, or email me directly: [max@testla.app](mailto:max@testla.app) Thank you very much for reading this.",

    "postText": "Anxiety is the anticipation of not being safe in the moment, for fear of the past, present or future. \n\nIt\u2019s the body\u2019s natural and often unconscious signaling which is there to help us by alerting us to particular threats. \n\nAvoiding the body\u2019s intelligence will shut the system down but it also shuts off other emotions and feelings, resulting in a total block of the system (depression) where the body feels nothing, yet still suffers because it has been deeply rejected and/or blocked. \n\nPeace is the capacity to be with a situation and to welcome it, not to avoid it, be distracted from it or to run from it. \n\nThe capacity for peace is built slowly, by engaging with the body\u2019s intelligence (feelings emotions etc.) and by developing more and more ability to work cohesively as a fully present being through the challenges of life.",

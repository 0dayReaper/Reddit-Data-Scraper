    "postText": "A night before.\n2:02am.\n\nI roll with my emotions as most people do with less regard to why I am feeling this way. I have no intentions to over analyze my emotions but I feel like penning them down here to keep it as a souvenir of my college days. The day I left college to come back home, I bet no one was as happy as I was. Dealing with few situations, I was no exception and hence, wanted a break. I prayed from the bottom of my heart and maybe this is the reason I got a chance to come back home and recharge my emotionally drained self. Well, no one knew this little break will stretch so much like malleable gold. While all my seniors and friends were desperate to go back to college after a month of complete lockdown, I was secretly elated to be home and wished our holidays to extend until one day when my fingers scrolled through the gallery and my mind recalled the good days I spent with my friends. It was only then I experienced an epiphany that pthe gravity of my negative emotions outweighed the positive ones. After spending days in introspection, I learnt those waves of emotions cradling my heart were now calm and composed than before. I began viewing the positive sides of every circumstance. I learnt I owe myself the love and care I try to give everyone else. Holding myself accountable for those ill sentiments was the best way to reconstruct them into some positivity. So, tonight the heart which once wanted to leave the college in despair is craving to go back and envision how the person she resides in has outgrown herself in all these months. My heart wants me to stand in front of the main gate and feel every little response. After all, it is the place where I spent the best days of my life.",

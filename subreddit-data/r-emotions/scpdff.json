I didn\u2019t have any respect for myself and I thought that everyone thought I was worthless or a joke or something.  Couldn\u2019t enjoy anything.  Felt no excitement.  Lost interesting in everything.  I got to a point where I guess I convinced myself that the only way to get through it was to stop caring and I guess I developed and pretty cynical outlook and soon after I stopped feeling altogether.  I distinctly remember feeling absolutely nothing on the day of high school graduation and leaving as soon as  I could.  Now I\u2019ve been in college for a few years and nothing has changed.  Can\u2019t even cry about it.  I don\u2019t remember most of my life anymore.",

You only think you are. \n\nReal objectivity is impossible, everything is filtered. \n\nYou don\u2019t see anything to be happy about, because you\u2019re blinkered. \n\nThis is not your fault.\n\nDepression is a trait that humans are very prone to. \n\nTo widen your perspective, learn how to appreciate small things every day. \n\nThe world does not have to be perfect for you to experience moments of happiness. Nor is occasional happiness a failure of intellect or awareness. \n\nRather the opposite.",

            "comment": " Hey! I hear  you. I wonder if you\u2019re feeling disappointed while seeing the world objectively. As you\u2019re aware of not feeling happy for the longest time, you may try with a gratitude journal. It may not make you feel happy instantly but you may get a perspective to acknowledge little things. Also, at times, talking about your emotions/feelings to your loved ones, colleagues or mental health professionals may help you to rediscover your own path towards happiness. Feel free to reach out. Take care",

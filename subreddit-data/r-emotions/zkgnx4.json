    "postText": "When i was kid i used to like a boy, he disappeared for 10 years and i saw him again (thanks that i told my mom he was there and she wanted to go to say hi but i was to shy to approach), we started to talk and eventually fell in love.   \nThe first time we had a real conversation (september 30) was till the night, after that day, he told me that he was going to have a brain surgery, and he disappeared, i was very worried so I texted his sister and she told me he had health problems, that when he wakes up he will tell me. I waited 2 days, and no response, after 3 days he texted me. In october I made a trip inside the country and I talked to him all the days, the doctor said he couldnt go out of his house for like a month, but he went out in less time because he was recovering fast. In october 22, we went out for the first time in 10 years, we went out many times and in november 1st, he asked me to be his girlfriend, we go out 3 times a week or more, im so happy with him but I also feel sad and worried. He had that brain surgery because in august he fell of his bike and a bunch of bikes fell on his head, that caused an intracranial hematoma (bleeding in his brain) he said that he felt good, but some minutes ago that he had an appointment with his doctor they made 2 tests, an angiography (that was positive) and a tomography (that was negative) to make sure about the results the doctor said that he has to take another test that is called panangiography, but that costs 15000 dollars, and he doesn't have that money, neither his family, but that is not what it worries me, the thing is that the test he had positive is more likely to be correct and if the panangiography is positive too he has to go to surgery and he might not survive it. I can't do anything to help him with his health, only to make him feel loved and that makes me break down. I can't do anything.",

Know that the love you share with him is a blessing in any capacity you feel it\u2019s good for you to share. It is so sad to be in a position to not be able to change anything. In circumstances like these it\u2019s only our choice to give what we can that makes it make sense.",

You can love yourself and love him without losing your boundary but it\u2019s a big challenge. You may look back on this at a later age and wonder what you could have done better. Just do your best so the rest of your life you can love yourself and know you tried in the ways that you could.",

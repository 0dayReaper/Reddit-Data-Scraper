Know that the love you share with him is a blessing in any capacity you feel it\u2019s good for you to share. It is so sad to be in a position to not be able to change anything. In circumstances like these it\u2019s only our choice to give what we can that makes it make sense.",

You can love yourself and love him without losing your boundary but it\u2019s a big challenge. You may look back on this at a later age and wonder what you could have done better. Just do your best so the rest of your life you can love yourself and know you tried in the ways that you could.",

            "comment": "You can't. Feelings exist for a reason, without them there'd be no motivation to act.\n\nWhat you can do is learn how to soothe bad feelings and break the cycle of feelings and imagination which can feed off each other.\n\nThe mid point of the liver, right under the middle of your ribcage, by your solar plexus, is where anxiety is felt. Anxiety is a fear of the future, of something bad happening, and it's interesting that happy excitement, anticipation of something good in the near future, is felt in almost the same place, just a little further forward, nearer the surface. \n\nPeople who drink too much alcohol often experience 'hangxiety' the next day, because the alcohol has made their liver ache and that feels just like anxiety, or dread. So anxiety is really just liver ache, but triggered by the imagination and specific nerves in the solar plexus, or 'gut brain.' A typical reaction to anxiety and stress might be anger, the 'fight or fkight' response.\n\nSo what to do with that understanding? You can massage your liver to ease the anxiety feeling, firm pressure with the heel of your hand, circular motion, it relaxes the tension there.  \n\nAlso, take probiotic supplements because most of the feel good chemicals in the body, like oxytocin, serotonin and dopamine are made and felt in the gut and probiotics increase their levels. You can take extra vitamin B and avoid alcohol and caffeine, which stress the liver, increasing unhappy feelings.\n\nYou can also drink more water to keep the liver healthy, and watch, read and listen to whatever makes you laugh. (Calvin and Hobbes worked for me.)\n\nIf you have anyone you can hug, do that. A 30 second hug releases all the happy chemicals and lowers blodd pressure. If you don't have a friend like that, consider getting a dog or borrowing one for walks. And hugs.\n\nEmotions/feelings are inevitable, but a lot of people feel much worse than they need to if they knew how to take better care of themselves.",

Bad news: you have to learn how to deal with your feelings. u/Carlbeernsen (in the post below) suggested how to deal with anxiety. I use a different approach. I either allow them to run through my body as a wave. Here is a video about that: [https://youtu.be/9jN4XYCAhPE](https://youtu.be/9jN4XYCAhPE) or I convert my sensations to a metaphor to find inner peace - very cool practice (let me know if you are interested to hear more).",

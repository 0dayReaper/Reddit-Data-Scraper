It is def inconvenient to feel things that aren\u2019t enjoyable but emotions aren\u2019t the problem, the things that are causing the tough emotions are. And \u2018problem\u2019 might be too strong a word bc somethings are supposed to feel bad. Emotions are there to guide us through life with the body\u2019s intelligence on our side. Imagine if you had your hand on a hot stove and your body didn\u2019t feel anything, didn\u2019t tell you to pull your hand away. In the same way we gotta be grateful for emotions that guide us towards, away from or through life\u2019s events.",

It\u2019s not like a bunch of light switches where you can be selective about what\u2019s on or off. So, totally understandable that you\u2019re going through an awful time in life. And it can be absolutely too much to bear alone at times. In these instances, the central nervous system starts shutting things down (including all sides of the spectrum.) The result moves us in the direction of dissociation and eventually depression where feeling emotions is indeed restricted and cut off from the body experience. But with that of course, the suffering of not feeling connection to ourselves or to our environment. That being said, I have no idea what your life situation is so it\u2019s not for me or anyone else to judge. If you\u2019d like to increase your capacity to move through this time (experiencing the awful as much as you can yet preserving your capacity to feel positive things too) therapy and support is the way to go. The added energetic, connective and processing capacity of our human (or support animal friends) can go a long way.",

            "comment": "As FitRefrigerator said, emotions are useful, even if they\u2019re uncomfortable. Look at how to change the situation, not hide from your feelings.  \nNo one likes to feel unhappy but someone without emotions or the ability to feel emotional pain is a danger to others because they can\u2019t feel empathy either.    \nYou haven\u2019t described specific reasons for your unhappiness but if it\u2019s an actual threat to your safety seek tel help to get out of that situation.   \nIf it\u2019s a whole lot of less serious stuff, look at how you can make things easier, the first step is to identify the root problems.  \nAvoid trying anything to dull or suppress or escape the emotions though, this is why most people take drugs long term.   \nIt just adds another set of serious problems and stops them from learning, gaining wisdom from their suffering and having the strength to change their lives.  \nAs long as it\u2019s not actually a threat to your safety, live with the pain and learn from it. It\u2019s trying to help you find a better way to live.",

            "comment": "There are absolutely no wrong feelings. Nothing you ever feel is wrong. Please know this. People feel all sorts of things and we are all each capable of feeling everything, good and bad.  Most people don't like admitting this, but we are all capable of the absolute best as well as the absolute worst possible, no matter who you are. What matters is how you respond to your feelings. You can't always control what you feel, but you have control over your response. Your thoughts and feelings don't make you who you are. It's your actions and decisions that do.\n\nAlso, know that emotions only last in the body for about 90 seconds. When they come, just let yourself feel them and then let them pass. If they last any longer than this, it is because you are choosing to remain feeling them or letting yourself get caught in a thought loop that keeps it active. Redirect your thoughts, your focus, your physiology, and you can redirect your emotions.",

It is common!\n\nIntuition is a great guide for us in decision making but we never have the crystal ball to the future and each decision carries with it an exponential number of consequences, some foreseeable, some unforeseeable. \n\nWhile that may seem impractical, unfair or downright chaotic, it does remind us of the importance to move forward slowly, wisely and compassionately. \n\nConsidering the many aspects of big decisions can at least help us prepare for some possibilities and to choose a path we deliberately intend as best as we can. \n\nAt the end of the day, we all struggle with what we\u2019ve been able to do, not do, foresee or not foresee. Some decisions work and some don\u2019t work out as intended, and yet we have a consistent reminder that we\u2019re all in the same boat, doing our best w what we\u2019ve got.  \n\nWhat\u2019s most important is that you can look back as your older wiser self and see that your younger self (the now version) did the best with whatever info and intuition you had to make your life better. So take your time and try the best you can. Forgive yourself when it\u2019s not perfect. And learn your lessons along the way. \n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "most emotions start with a energy difference created by the comparison of reallty as you perceive it vs reality as you expected/desired it... this energy revs up your eMOTORS to act to change that difference... the problem is that many are focusing that energy on the past where it can only generate frustration and sadness rather than real progress... you cannot revive or fix the dead past... not accepting this seems to be root cause of sustained suffering. Part of the solution is to self-talk to your irrational parts, tell them to accept the past that actually occurred and focus the energy forwards to a goal that will benefit your whole self.",

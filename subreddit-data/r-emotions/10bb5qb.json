    "postText": "I've been talking with a friend about various emotions and if we can simplify the mental process down to mathematical equations. This started when we accidentally [defined FOMO as an equation](https://neil.gg/2023/01/13/what-is-fomo/). We're curious... if we made a whole collection of emotional equations, would that be interesting? I personally find it very helpful to think about my emotions in terms of math, but wonder if others do too!",

It always has to go your way.\n\nYou get mad at me for not wanting the same things as you.\n\nYou never see my view. \n\nYou never see my view in, why I feel this certain way.\n\nYou can't just let me go. \n\nYou hurt me more than you know by not understanding me on why I let you go.\n\nSo please for the sake of you caring about me and loving me. \n\nStop hurting me and let me go. \n\nYou never saw my view.",

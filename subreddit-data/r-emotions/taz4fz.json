    "postText": "Hi, I don\u2019t want to say my age or what I identify as but I\u2019m under 35 and over 27. Through all of the things I\u2019ve been through I\u2019ve never felt like myself again. I tend to try and over achieve to fill voids in my heart after my mother passed. I continuously feel like I have to hide the deepest parts of me because I won\u2019t be protected when I show myself. Even when I am open and vulnerable I\u2019ve been proven correctly about why I hide my emotions and feelings. I cried in the bathroom before work because I just don\u2019t know the answers. I don\u2019t know how to get close to be or even stay close to people because of the fear of rejection and abandonment. I ask myself often what\u2019s the end goal if I don\u2019t have the answers nor if I feel safe. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m ready to let go of everything. Just looking for encouragement.",

            "comment": "Hi, sorry you\u2019re going through this. Ideally you\u2019d have a close friend you can trust and feel safe with to just be yourself, but a lot of people don\u2019t have that, or don\u2019t have that available when they suffer a loss or significant setback. So what to do?   \nWe\u2019re a social species; it\u2019s natural for us to want company and look for the help of others, but in reality we ourselves are the only person who is with us every day and knows us completely. So it\u2019s worth being friends with yourself and looking after yourself. There are lots of different therapies and practises aimed at relieving stress and promoting well being, and I\u2019m going to suggest one that you may not have heard of.   \nFirstly I want to point out that emotions are physical sensations, which is why we call them feelings, and all our emotions/feelings, good and bad, are felt in the abdomen. This is because our second brain, the solar plexus, sits below the stomach and it\u2019s main job is to create our feelings. Without feelings thoughts have no \u2018weight\u2019, no motivation. Feelings are what control all our choices. So the solar plexus reacts to signals from our head brains and twitches and tickles specific places in the smooth muscles around our internal organs, to create feelings that match its interpretation of the situation. Real time or memory, it can\u2019t tell the difference, so memories trigger feelings too.   \nYou can work on the thoughts that signal the solar plexus and you can also soothe and relax the muscles that signal feelings. Which is what I\u2019m going to suggest.   \nMany osteopaths are trained in a technique of abdominal massage called \u2018visceral manipulation\u2019 and often called the \u2018Barral Technique\u2019 after a French osteopath. It\u2019s actually an old Chinese method used for various physical issues but also for stress relief. I know several people, including my own son, who have experienced amazing joy and happiness as a result of having these muscular tensions released and soothed by this technique. I\u2019ve studied numerous \u2018thinking therapies\u2019 over the years and I think that direct massage of the solar plexus area by a trained professional who understands the solar plexus is a valuable tool for letting go of accumulated stress and anxiety.  \nIf you can, I suggest it\u2019s worth your time to try it. Good luck.",

If we hold on to negative feelings they become a pattern, until we deliberately change that. But positive feelings can be trained too. You have to watch/read/listen to comedy, go for brisk walks and exercise, drink plenty of water and make sure to take B vitamins, D3, calcium and magnesium as these reduce stress and anxiety. St Johns Wort is a useful tonic for helping sleep and relieving stress too.",

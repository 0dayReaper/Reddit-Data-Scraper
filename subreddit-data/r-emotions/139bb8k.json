    "postText": " \n\n**What is Love?**\n\nA lot of people know of the mentality of love in which describes a way of Love. Free and fun-loving is what some might point towards and living with care and kindness within our lives can be a loving way to live. This is not just a starting point but rather a home for how we want to operate at times. There is also potentially a literal mentality energy in regards to that of love pertaining to the overlapping layers on our head area is sometimes discerned by psychics and things of that nature. There is many other kinds of compositions and machinisms of love but one of the most important I feel is that of the Emotion of Love in which some of us have been able to identify in regards to falling in love. That warm loving feeling in the chest area and heart centre in which is a partial indicator that one is in love.\n\n**An emotion?**\n\nThe Emotions that we feel in our Heart Centre and Emotion Area is potentially a stimuli that tells of the spiritual around us. We feel and experience emotions daily which lets us know that we are more than flesh and blood and that we potentially have a soul. It\u2019s one of the things that spiritualists can point towards in a scientific way that can lament upon learning in which you are going through in regards to Spiritual Education. The Science of Anatomy will potentially reveal in the future what spiritualist of today are letting know of in the communities that have emerged partially by way of the connection that the internet has created as well as connectedness of nature. Emotions I feel are part of Nature and that myriads of different informations out there letting know of other kinds of stimuli as well that could potentially be considered nature as well.\n\n**What exactly is an emotion?**\n\nWe experience emotions potentially in multiple kinds of\u00a0 ways but the main way that even the average person on this planet discerns the stimuli of emotions is that of feeling and some might point towards touch in which I feel could be considered but the utilization of the word feeling potentially points as well at times to the multi use that spirit employs in regards to certain words in which we use. Feeling almost laments upon another describer word that we use in which explains another kind of sense we have partially in regards to being able to sense emotions. We feel emotions and potentially touch emotions in a certain kinds of way. Visually how amazing would be if the Spirit World was looking upon Emotions similar to how they view physicals. It speaks of how the different perceptions pertaining to sense and what exactly we are. That there could be life within emotion itself is a possibility I have noticed through my own psychic research, Spiritual Communications and experiences.\n\n**What kinds of emotions are there?**\n\nImagine the composition and colour of physicals and other-dimensional beings impacted upon certain actions. That spiritually we could change colour based upon certain energy promotions in which even the energy promotion compositions themselves could potentially be affected upon the action themselves. Even moods could be impactful in regards to how we sense certain kinds of energies.\u00a0 The\u00a0colour and composition of emotions being impacted at times in regards to the kinds of emotions we create and the thought that we are creating\n\n**What exactly does it feel like?**\n\nMany different kinds of stimuli. There is a lot of different kinds of feeling associated with kinds of senses that we are able to experience in regards to that of Love. From the breathlessness of fear to the high pitch illumination of Joy, the sorrows of despair to the mourning of sadness. To be able to describe some of these experiences without having to use the literal words in which it is trying to describe can be difficult especially since we use those very words to describe other kinds of things within life. We know it to exist by way of how we experience emotions and it is one of those senses in which has been described and understood in ways in which can seem kind of crazy that we don\u2019t fully know the metaphysics behind emotions especially in regards to how we have approached emotion in regards to the scientific communities. This speaks though of the glitch within the system especially in regards to some equating seemingly lack of proof that we have spirit when it partially lies within emotional research. Even describing some of the emotions that exist to regular folk sparks remembrance and understanding in ways in which let know that emotions exist.\n\n**What exactly does it affect?**\n\nWe as physical beings on this planet experience emotion to a certain degree as to acknowledge it\u2019s existence but what exactly is it? Analyze the emotions in which you feel daily and you may become more aware of the truth that exists behind those emotions. I have come to the believing factors that there is life within emotion through my own experiences. That the emotions that we create impact other kinds of spiritual entities behind the scenes in ways in which would make us pay more attention to our emotions. Affecting relationships and mentality, behaviour and personality upon emotional utilization. For some it might affect the setting and interaction in regards to ourselves. Again, seen within Near Death Experience tells of how in certain dimensional existence they can feel emotions to a heightened degree. The imaginings of being able to feel some of our emotions to such a degree especially the negative ones can give one a clue to the kinds of affect it can have on spiritual entities within radius of some of those emotions. For some realms the emotional climate of person might be weather patterns seen in the sky. It\u2019s makes one think about when we look up at the skies and the kind of weather systems we a re experiencing could be the mood atmospherics of the planet. Either way emotions affect many different things and it\u2019s not just in a visual sort of way but just as how we perceive emotions to be in an extra sensory sort way knocks upon the door that there are many different kinds of senses in which some spirits are perceiving emotions.\n\n**Is there a difference between feeling emotion and creating it?**\n\nYes, although just because we feel emotions throughout our life doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t creating those emotions as well by way of different spiritual mechanics. There is discernible difference though upon creating emotions and feeling emotions. Throughout our life we feel emotions naturally based upon certain situations in which can feel to be less of a willful endeavour in which behind the scenes spiritually it might very well be a willful endeavour. With that being said there is real emotion mechanisms that we can utilize to create emotions daily at will on our end. When you compare the stimuli of feeling emotions and creating emotions there is at least on the onset a difference. Imagine someone moving your leg in which in how it is experienced make you feel like your moving your own leg.\u00a0Certain spiritual mechanisms being revealed to understand the difference between moving your own leg and someone moving your own leg. It might seem strange but understanding how Channeling works from the spirit can be equated to this example that spiritual entities are working through our own movements at times and that ability to be able to sense that. The same could be said about emotional implantation in regards to the emotions that we feel and being able to discern the difference between spiritual influencing and that of our own emotions as well as understanding the difference between feeling emotions and creating emotions. There are literal mechanisms of emotion in which one can use to create emotions. At times we haven\u2019t been able to fully feel these mechanisms. It\u2019s a tell of some of the lack of awareness in regards to our own spiritual emotional mechanisms. That we could go through life without fully being aware of a communication and sense that we could utilize daily that we have put on the back seat and labelled something that we feel at times instead of something that we can utilize partially by way of our interaction in regards to such a concept of emotions. It would be as if certain spirit channeled through our out loud voice and mind voice at times in which we labelled as something we are able to discern at times rather than be able to use daily as we often do in life. It\u2019s the subtle view in regards to emotions that laments upon something so as strange and obvious in regards to the fact that we are as passive as we have been in regards to our emotions. Partially has to do with understanding emotion and also speaks of the need to put more resources in regards to researching our own emotions.\n\n**How do you create Love?**\n\nI learned from certain meditational techniques to be able to invoke the emotion of love where I then was able to understand the methods of emotional creation. As a psychic I am able to feel certain spiritual mechanisms that certain normal people might not be able to fully feel but regular people do know that emotion exists by way of feeling emotions daily. Being able to emulate the emotions you feel at times by way of emotional creation is a part of the learning. I learned from a spiritualist that explained these methods in what he called HCR that being Heart Chakra Radiance or Heart Radiance. White Light visualization techniques in which lent towards learning how to love. That would eventually lead towards the ability of being able to create one of the most wonderful emotions daily.\n\n**How does Love help you Spiritually?**\n\nWhat if I was to tell you that we could create emotions through willful energy promotions and help Spirits behind the scenes in multiple kinds of capacities.\u00a0That there is an actual emotion of love in which you can create that can be beneficial to your spiritual life through direct and indirect means. The radiance of loving energy creates bonds and connection in which furthers relationship in multiple regard and some of it might just be based off of the experience itself. Remember that some of the beings that utilize love might only be able to sense love through the feeling of emotion similar to how physical humans on this physical planet Earth mainly sense love. You can see the power within that and the emotion itself and the kind of impact that can have. There are spirits out there that base how it helps them simply by way of how it feels. The loving radiance can strengthen one karmically by way of how the light judges that action to be moral as well as the kind of energy projected. Raising karmic vibration as well as potentially others in the spirit world. Some of this is partially based of the parameters in how we want the love to affect us and some of which might be set up pre-incarnation and situated by Main Spirit Guides. In the spirit our Anatomy might very well be strengthened by way of loving daily. Think of weight lifting as a metaphor, that when we lift weights and exercise some of our anatomy is affected in certain ways in which can lend towards health. By way of Loving daily we increase and protect our spiritual Health. Think about being able to incarnate from our dimensional live into another existence and that within that existence we could pump iron in which would strengthen ourselves but at a pace where wouldn\u2019t need to lift weights as much as we would have in the pre-incarnate dimensions partially by way of the science of the dimensional existences. This is partially why Incarnation is miraculous and amazing and the metaphor in regards to weight lifting potentially can be said about loving daily while incarnate in which creates a lot positive karma and spiritual health by way of karmic science. We can utilize this to streamline our Karma progression by way of being incarnate and promoting Morality and other kinds of energy promotions.\n\n**Why do we gain Karma from Loving Daily?**\n\nThere are many different kinds of layers to the Spirit Realm. In different dimensional existences there are different kinds of energy promotions in which literally strengthens our spiritual bodies by way of energy promotions. There is a baseline in regards to some of those Dimensional Existences in which points towards ethical alignment increasing Spiritual Frequency and vibration. Think of the Light seen in Near Death Experience Research as one of the Heavenly Existences that some of us traverse after death in which potentially exists around us while we live our life. There are many psychics that point towards Heaven being on Earth and one of the interpretations is a literal in that one of the overlaps around us is the Light and another speaks that we are of condensed light by way of physical dimensional science. The Light has been described in many ways from a Non-Living Higher Power to a Living Dimensional Setting with Personality but regardless we can utilize the Light to let know of certain kinds of Variables that can affect our karmic. This Karma might affect all manner of things in the Light. Think of the Light to also be a place in which is reported in the NDE Accounts in which within the Light there are different layers in which I have learned to call Plane Levels. These Plane Levels to some might look like different surfaces in which we can Traverse. Imagine being able to see multiple kinds of surfaces to the Earth where different Continents exist and potentially different kinds of peoples. For simplistic purposes imagine the light as a Cylinder beam of Light, in which there are many different levels within that Cylinder of Light. Our spiritual Anatomy potentially tethered to that Light by way of being Spiritual Entities of the Light. The God Spark is spoken of in multiple kinds of Spiritualist writings and regardless of how we were created there is multiple kinds of information in which point towards a large portion of All That Is being of the Light, some of which in a literal way. Karmic Vibration, Karmic Level and Karmic Frequency being reflected by the colour of our Light and other kinds in which points towards the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend often called a Nexus Point. That Nexus Point reflecting our soul colour by way of karmic tethering to the plane level represented in the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend.\u00a0The Light Considers Loving to be a Moral Act and when we Love the Light allocates karma in regards to ourselves which increases our vibration, frequency and karma which also increase our access within the Light to Higher Plane levels and is reflected by our Karmic Colour.\n\n**How does our Karmic Colours Correspond with Karmic Levels?**\n\nThink of those Plane Levels within the Light to be of different kinds of Coloured Light. I learned from one of my Spiritual Teachers certain kinds of Karmic Paradigms to exist within the Light. Different kinds of coloured levels of Light in which I adapted based off of Communication and subtle signs within the physical Itself. The physical Colour Spectrum being one of those tells in regards to which Karmic Colour corresponded with different plane level existences.\n\nAt a young age I was able to see dots of light in which I would find out are potentially interacting with me from the Spirit World. These dots of Light I was told and would confirm with psychic communication were potentially the Karmic Colours of Spiritual Entities in which I was able to see, it was one of the first psychcitivty that manifested. These Karmic Colours being representative in regards to the Highest Point within Light that they could ascend. Another subtle tell would that of the prism rainbow which speaks of the power of shapes. Which can reveal rainbows within light naturally in the physical. There is a spiritual metaphor regarding this pertaining to certain light existences afterlife. Entire surfaces of coloured Light located within certain Light Dimensional setting.\n\n**What can you do being located at Higher Levels of Light?**\n\nAs you increase in Frequency, Vibration and Karma you become more powerful as your God Spark and Soul grows and strengthens from Higher Light Access.\u00a0A simplistic way of looking at certain kinds of Karmic levels is equating it to video game levels that as you promote Morality and Love you increase in levels in which your powers strengthen as you move to Higher levels. Larger utilization of Light in regards to Creation is another possibility of the benefits of moving upwards in frequency. Access to different kinds of cities of Light and information located above. Abilities Manifesting as you reach those levels of Light in ways in which can help you in Daily Spiritual Life. This lending towards the theory of God-Realization through morality promotion, love and other kinds of energy creation.\n\n**God-Realization Theory?**\n\nDo note that this is a theory and I would still pursue the methods described in regards to Heart Radiance pertaining to Learning to Love regardless of what you believe in. Many understand the feelings of emotion and even the baseline feeling that you can create daily in regards to Love can be beneficial. There is an idea that the creator split himself to create many different kinds of spirits at lower karmic thresholds in which lends towards the God spark theories found in spiritualist writings on this planet. It also explains why there has not been more large scale miracles located on this planet and elsewhere at times in regards to the hypothesis that God potentially did not survive the split but there are also other theories as to why certain kinds of spiritual intervention has not yet happened similar to that of the Prime Directive which still lends to the idea that God has very much survived. There is a Theory that explains that certain kinds of Gods have yet to emerge to that original Karmic Level of the original Creator when he split up. Upon reaching those Kamric levels, certain spirits reaching to the karmic level of what some would equate to being Gods, would be able to emerge in the physical and harness the power obtained to promote larger acts of Morality like heal the sick on this planet in an instant and create large-scale manifestations of food and water for those in need.\u00a0 This idea that we could love daily while incarnate and streamline karmic progression where upon we eventually could be considered what some would consider to be Gods. Imagine passing on to the next place and through the act of love achieving God-Realization in certain dimensional existences.\n\n**What is the Importance of Love?**\n\nIt is described in many different sources and seen within many different writings. Experiences beyond in many different kinds of afterlife described where the feelings described let know of extra sensory ability extends beyond what\u00a0we are able to discern at times while incarnate. Let knows of the importance of the creation of love is consistent so much so that it has seeped into our own society in it\u2019s own way as an underlying subconscious in which is partially based upon the spiritual understanding of just how important the endeavour of Love can be. It\u2019s more than just being able to traverse plane levels while incarnate and streamlining progression to that of Godship. The emotion encapsulates a secret that has been lost in some places in which at times certain spiritual communities have understood. The essence of what we are and one of the abilities to be able to express this.\n\n**Why does the Light consider Loving to be Moral?**\n\nThe Light can discern Moral actions in more advanced ways than some of us discern morality to be. There is a gauge in regards to what we consider morality to be and what actions would be considered moral in which potentially stems from what the Light considered to be ethical. You can ask the average person as to whether they felt love to be a Moral action and the response will be heavily in favour of it being a Moral action for a reason. The moral Compass Gauges it to be that partially by way of societal perception in which is potentially based off of the Original Light ethical discernment. When coupled with the actual action and the feelings it can create, the connection and essence of what we are and used to be exists within the act of Loving. This creates a karmic gain upon the act itself. Our Societal Ethical Compass in what we understand to be Moral is a fairly good gauge in what the Light would consider to be Moral. There is a literal science in regards to how the Light understands Morality in which is Systemically Ancient.\n\nWhy does Society not fully understand these secrets of Love?\n\nThere is a reason why Love is considered to be secret to life. It\u2019s espoused in many different ways throughout spiritualist writings and Near Death Accounts that this is the case. Even in a mainstream way, Love is an underlying current that some are aware of and the concept exists in many kinds of forms in which societal awareness and understanding can grasp in certain ways. The key in regards to that awareness lies within falling in Love and what exactly that entails. Heart Song. Heart feelings in which leads someone to claim at times they are in Love is one of the specifics in which Heart Radiance exists within the context of what society understands love to be. The difficulty is that at times in regards to identifying that Love as a Real emotion in which can be utilized daily is that it has been turned into symbol where the knowledge of loving emotional radiance has been hidden. The great thing about it though is that it is a great positive to have such an interest in such a concept in which brings peripheral understanding and context in trying to explain what exactly Love is. It\u2019s not a concept as a psychic-medium that I would have to explain into detail as there already is perceptual understanding. There are many different kinds of Acts of Love but one of the ones I am espousing is in regards to literal emotional creation. It extend beyond though in many different capacities as I would find out.\n\nHow Exactly is literal Love going to Help me though?\n\nIt can create an environment around you spiritually where like minded spirits traverse to your process in which positively impact your life and lives of others. There are those in the spirit realm that benefit from love creation daily. It strengthens bonds and relationships and the invoking of Love and help in regards to the creation can be considered to be a moral endeavour. It helps create positive karma and can create higher light access in which can be utilize to create good. Potentially gaining access to new areas within the light and advanced abilities manifestation. It can lead towards greater emotional awareness and I feel it is a decent path towards becoming psychic and empathic should you want to pursue that endeavour. Spiritual Guideships know what you want as they can ask you spiritually in multiple kinds of ways without having to ask the you dimensional live self in a certain context. It strengthens certain setting and environment at times by way of utilizing love daily. The area around oneself benefits form utilizing love daily and can create positive effects as well as natural defense from certain negative spiritual entities. Literal boundaries set by way one emotionally presents oneself can lend towards the atmospherics of a process being impacted although there are spiritual teams that can help in regards to the negative of this understanding. It\u2019s not just helping you though it\u2019s also helping some of your spirit teams and as well as those that you love towards.",

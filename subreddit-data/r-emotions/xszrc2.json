Nothing will feel normal for a while, but after years of reflection, I respect him for making the choice he felt he needed. \n\nI know it probably doesn't help to hear, but everything is going to be OK. Don't worry about having the \"right\" feelings. Everyone grieves differently.",

But there are really good resources to understand what\u2019s going on emotionally. It may range from being totally numb to totally angry and things move in stages so it\u2019s not always easy to see unless you know you\u2019re actually \u201cin\u201d the process. Of course, it takes time. But you did the right thing for seeking support and resources. Maybe you want to check for grieving support in your native language.",

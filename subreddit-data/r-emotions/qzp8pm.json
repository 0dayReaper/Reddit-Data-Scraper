Denying them, burying them, pretending they don't exist etc. is only denying yourself and these feelings will build and build until you can't handle them anymore. Sit with the feeling for a few minutes, acknowledge it's existence and ask yourself why you are feeling this way? \n  \nEmotions are just your subconscious talking to us. Listen to your subconscious, it wants the best for you.",

The thing about emotions is that they are so complicated, i really tried to listen to them and was doing well, at least that is what i thought. So tell me please, what if i feel like i don't have the energy to process my thoughts and emotions now, what should i do and is there a way to kind of put them on hold for now?",

Most people would suggest looking into guided meditation, and I highly recommend it as well. and when you can, find a therapist to help you untangle the tangled web that is your mind. \n  \nThe route I personally went was taking mushrooms and sitting with my thoughts, but that's a very direct and intense route to take and not everyone is wired for it. It's not an easy route, if you choose that one, do not go alone. \n \nAlternatively, Finding an outlet to let your chaotic energy out is something many find useful. Join a boxing gym and punch out your anger. Sit in your car and scream out into the void. Find something that can help you let go of the feeling in a cathartic way.\n  \nNo one solution will be the best, you are on a lifelong journey of self discovery. Enjoy the ride. The suffering and anguish give a backdrop to help you appreciate the joys of this world.",

That should really be your first priority if you can accommodate it. All of the other steps will be so much more difficult if you are not well rested. I know \"just sleep more, lol\" isn't very helpful because there are likely so many reasons that you are not getting adequate sleep. But sit and look at all of the reasons you are not sleeping much. Do research, there is a lot of good information on the internet. \n  \nAnd I'm glad I could help, it brings me joy to see the positive impacts I can make on the world.",

That's progress! \n  \nIt definitely sounds like the first steps on your journey will be learning to manage stress so that you have accumulated throughout the day. Find a way to let go of it before going to bed. Some options from an internet stranger (But please do research online to find ways that will wok best for you) \n  \nScream into the pillow \n  \nWorkout before bed\n  \nWrite down all the things that you are worried about so that you can let your mind forget about them for the night. This one works best for me personally when the thoughts are swirling in my mind. I can let myself forget for a time without worrying about actually forgetting.",

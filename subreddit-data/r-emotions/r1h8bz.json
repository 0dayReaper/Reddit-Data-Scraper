    "postText": "*Hi y'all, here's the short version:*\n\nI'm actually super empathetic towards others but can't seem to connect to my needs and, tbh, very fragile emotional side. I could say that despite many struggles I've become kind of successful for my age or at least I'm well of in that sense. But for me to get here, I had to basically kill my sensitive side, at least when it came to catering to my own well-being.\n\nCan anyone relate or help me understand this dynamic better? I'm kinda confused if that's even possible. But I suspect that's the case because sometimes, especially ina 1-on-1 setting with supervisors or authority figures, I almost break into tears because deep down I know I suppress my emotions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*here's the longer one (slight trigger warning):*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm not sure where precisely to share this.. but I'm kinda confused about my personality.\n\nThing is, I am highly emotionally aware of others (empathy) but at the same time I certainly also have quite dark strikes about me... which I have a feeling I might not be completely aware of.\n\nI'm usually quite friendly and have a hard time saying no for example, whenever interacting with others (yeah, I'm working on that). But then when noone's looking (or when I just have those sudden moments where idgaf) it's like a veil is lifted and I become careless, ruthless, perverted and manipulative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem for me is the fact that it's a constant up and down and I can't pin point myself why my mood changes like that. It might literally be a disorder, idk??!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther thing worth mentioning is that I grew up under a lot of (perceived) pressure to succeed from parents and hid away porn cosumption/addiction beginning at age 9yo. Later I would also get too involved in party drugs which might also have messed me up - not too much tho. Another thing is that I had a strong desire to pr\\*ostitute myself even when I was underage and came very close to doing so.... not sure whether porn plays a role here, again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not typing this out for attention and it might all sound stupid, but I'm genuinely confused about myself. I know I can be the sweetest and most caring person in the world and at the same time I have this darkness that just kreeps out at times. I do things that actually harm me but at the same time i feel good about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame goes for academic or business success. I constantly sabotage myself but simultaneously get superb feedback from teachers and supervisors.... but it's just like i have a blind spot about myself and i couldn't really see through it all.\n\nMight also be worth mentioning that I used to have some depersonalisation episodes, partially drug induced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just tiped this all out spontaneously so I hope it's not too all over the place. Just for your info, I'm actually in college and have a decent job, so not doing too badly. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",

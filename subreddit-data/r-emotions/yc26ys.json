    "postText": "I feel fucked, I feel violated, I feel as if I have truly given all I can and I have recieved absolutely nothing. Most of the people who I thought as of friends abandoned me in my time of need. My OCD really stalled any and all future plans I had for myself and well life is just hard. Anyhow..not complaining. I'll get over this (eventually) but I just wanted to share how I feel. I will keep on grinding through this mess we call life. It's healthy for me to share my emotions. I used to be so repressed and now i'm not. That's a step forward",

And when it gets too much, remember there is qualified support for these hard times esp when it seems our struggles may be beyond our friend/family ability to handle. Doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love us, just means we have to take responsibility to find the support our system needs. Sounds like you\u2019re a good friend to others so you can decide what boundary feels fair and safe for you there. Feel welcomed to keep us updated and thanks so much for sharing your voice here.",

I always had the stupid idea that being a man=hiding emotions. I have slowly moved away from that idea and I feel so much better now. One can't simply go through life hiding who you are and you are right, it is our responsibility to find support. Thanks for the openness",

Thank you for bringing this to the channel and for others to acknowledge and learn from your experience. \ud83d\ude4c There are so many still stuck that can read but can\u2019t yet comment. That can wonder but not put themselves in a position to act. Nothing wrong with this stage, just acknowledging you for making the progress you earned.",

    "postText": "So about 4 years ago I had a similar interaction with a girl where I was very interested in her, we connected right off the bat and then some time went by and I started to become needy and desperate. I don\u2019t understand what happened. I don\u2019t know why that happened and what triggered it exactly but a very similar dynamic occurred recently in the past few months with a girl that reminds me of the one from 4 years ago. I would like to know how to stop this so that I DO NOT sabotage any opportunity I have with a girl every time I find one that I truly care about. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s like there is something in the way and then it gets triggered and then I fuck things up. I\u2019m ready to change the narrative and see what better things can happen in my life with the people that I truly care about and want to be around. Please help. I used to be VERY good with women and now I don\u2019t know what happened. I would like to go back to being good at what I do. I would like to be myself before the bullshit please.",

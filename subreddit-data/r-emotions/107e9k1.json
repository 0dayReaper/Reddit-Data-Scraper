It happens more easily with people I'm closer to, and I hate that I get so annoyed by it.\nThe worst is when they ask questions they've asked before. I guess that part makes more sense to be annoyed by, but at the same time I'm just getting annoyed by their terrible memory which is weird.\n\nHow do I stop getting so annoyed by these things?",

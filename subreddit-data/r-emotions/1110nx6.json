    "postText": "Why am I so angry alllllll the time??? Over the dumbest things, too.\n\nWith everybody I am close with I get mad about every little thing, and I'm always in a bad mood and it's usually such a massive eruption of anger; exhibit a: my cousin asked me to send him a link when he could've just done the research him, i was pretty irritated with that. exhibit b, i accidentally referred to the week starting on a monday and my partner follows up with \"the week actually starts on sunday\", and it just sent me over the EDGE. \n\nbut then any anger I feel disappears after about 10 minutes and I get like a huge wave of happiness and everything is good again. What the hell is going on??",

            "comment": "See one! Therapy is really helpful. I tried my best not to go therapy and do self help at first but when I couldn't really understand myself anymore because none seems to work, I went to see one. And as what my therapist said, there are a lot of coping mechanisms because this is our brain's defense so that we'll be okay at the moment BUT not all coping mechanisms have good LONG TERM effect. That's why it's best to go therapy since well, these are professionals that actually study these stuff. \n\nBut I have to commend you OP because even if you're so angry all the time, it reveals your true character that you don't want it affecting you or the people around you. It takes a lot of humility and care.",

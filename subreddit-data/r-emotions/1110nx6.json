I tried my best not to go therapy and do self help at first but when I couldn't really understand myself anymore because none seems to work, I went to see one. And as what my therapist said, there are a lot of coping mechanisms because this is our brain's defense so that we'll be okay at the moment BUT not all coping mechanisms have good LONG TERM effect. That's why it's best to go therapy since well, these are professionals that actually study these stuff. \n\nBut I have to commend you OP because even if you're so angry all the time, it reveals your true character that you don't want it affecting you or the people around you. It takes a lot of humility and care.",

    "postText": "I was just having a moment and wanted to write it down somewhere. I wish my dad and I were closer. Growing up with divorced teenage parents, I ended up spending more time with my uncle and grandma while my dad worked to take care of me, so we never really got to bond as much. As I got older and into my teenage years, he remarried and started being home more and tried to be closer in our family, but he was religious and strict and I was a slightly rebellious teen, so more often than not I was in trouble and he was disappointed in me. It finally got to the point that I moved out and don't really contact him as much as we both would like simply because we were never that close to begin with. It makes me sad that I can't just tell him things, and really have that daddy daughter bond that I desperately wish we did. There is no fixing it at this point because every time I try and get closer, it ends in him talking about how something I've done disappointed him and it really screws up my mental health, and I've only just started to get out of a really bad place. It just makes me sad and I wish there was some way I could fix it. Anyways, thanks for listening to my sadboi spiel.",

We never know what he went through and there might be a lot of things that he never told you which could make a change in your current mindset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this might be on the top layer of your brain all the time but trust me I've been through worse but the best advice I can give you is to avoid being a victim, what's gone is gone.\n\nTell me if I can help you with something, I don't know much about you but here's something I never heard in my life which I always craved\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am here for you, so chill, you got this.",

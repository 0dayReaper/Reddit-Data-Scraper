    "postText": "A few nights ago I acted very emotionally immature and resorted to saying very mean things to someone I care about because they hurt me. Ever since then I wake up every single day feeling guilty wishing I could apologize or go back in time but I can\u2019t and I know they don\u2019t wanna hear anything from me now or possibly ever. How can I stop feeling this way?",

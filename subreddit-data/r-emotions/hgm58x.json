    "postText": "My hubby is a great guy but he has issues dealing with emotions and when he is confronted about something that he did which was upsetting he lashes out. I tell him language and he knows that what he is saying is inappropriate I just wish there was a way to make it so he just responds as ok I will try harder rather than anger toward what was said. I mean we have had talks like that and when what ever was discussed happened again he did listen to what I was asking it\u2019s just hard when he reacts that way in the moment. Any ideas",

He may not feel the same and cant get through that he is doing the best he can and your prescription of his mis fortunes isnt necessary accurate. Lets hear what he does that is ok in your opinion.",

There is no great answer.   my sons album title says it best.  Fate for failure.  To a man there must be a bigger picture a light at the end on the tunnel. For some its as easy as holding a carrot in front of them. For others is a overwhelming feeling of lack of big picture purpose or having a lack of accomplishment in his life. I find that most men who lash out in this manner have a lot nore to offer in life then what there showing and even more so have a higher intelligence level then most and tend to isolate. Most dont realize there this way......",

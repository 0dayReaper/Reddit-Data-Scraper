There are times I don\u2019t even want to cry because I feel others will see it as weakness and misunderstand me. How do I not cry and learn to hold back tears? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s things that could help redirect my mind, right?",

That fact that you're aware of it enough to communicate it is a good step to working on it. Working with an emotion coach can help you sort it out.   \n\n\nIf it helps, anger is not bad. None of our emotions are bad, we have them all for a reason. If you're angry, you're allowed to be angry. Sometimes it can be that simple, but we find alll kinds of ways to complicate it.",

            "comment": "Crying is a healthy response to being upset but it\u2019s not helpful in some situations, or around some people. You haven\u2019t said how old you are, but most people\u2019s strong emotional reactions are triggered not just by the present situation but draw on earlier experiences. We have our \u2018buttons pushed\u2019 and react more strongly than the present situation really warrants.\nThere is a technique you can use to lessen the residual effect of past experiences so that your present response is more realistic or \u2018controlled\u2019.\nIt\u2019s an exercise of the imagination called \u2018remote control\u2019. The idea is to diminish your sensitivity to stored emotional memories. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done:\n\nGet comfortable. Imagine you\u2019re sitting in front of a screen, with a remote control in your hand. When you press \u2018play\u2019 a past event will start to play in front of you, one that was upsetting to you. But you don\u2019t watch it. Instead you hit Fast Forward so all you see is a speeded up, blurry version of the event. At the end you press Rewind and it runs back at high speed, all jumpy and blurry. You don\u2019t relive the experience, you take control of it. You do this again and again. Then you press another button which makes the speeded up video turn black and white. And run through it forwards and backwards several times. Then you press another button which makes the images much smaller, and again you run through it forwards and backwards at high speed. All the time you\u2019re training yourself to minimise the emotional connection to that event, and you do it with all the past events you can remember that made you upset and angry. \nIf you do this regularly, and with new events as they happen, you\u2019ll train yourself to be in control of your emotional responses and less liable to have your \u2018buttons pushed\u2019 by new situations.",

Receiving signals from the brain stem via the vagus nerve, it \u2018twitches\u2019 those muscles in specific places to create our \u2018feelings\u2019 which are our emotions. Repeated patterns become ingrained as a muscle memory, making sadness or dread or joy or whatever more and more easily accessed.",

            "comment": "Hello! There is nothing wrong with crying. It helps enhance your mood and helps recover from grief. It also helps get rid of toxins and hormones that contribute to elevated stress levels. But, here are a few ways to help you control your emotions:    \n\nFirst, try to figure out your emotional triggers - this can help you understand and control your emotions. The emotional trigger could be a situation or a person. But, do not suppress your emotions.  Not allowing yourself to acknowledge and feel your emotions can build up and over time you will get overwhelmed and might burst out, so find a healthy outlet for your emotions. This outlet can be anything, from art to sports. Here are a few common emotional outlets:                                                                                                                                                                                      1) **Exercise**: Physical activity releases endorphins which enhances mood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2) **Meditation**: It helps you relax and navigate through your emotions.                                                                                                                                                         3) **Journaling**: Writing down your thoughts and feelings reduces stress and also helps you prioritize                                                                                                                      \n\nIf you are comfortable, think about seeking support from a therapist. They will be able to guide you through the process and even help you identify your emotional triggers. I hope this helps.",

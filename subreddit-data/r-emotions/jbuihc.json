It aims to be an **expression of the complexity and interconnectedness of the emotions** we feel as part of our inner worlds. \n\nAs part of my research I'm conducting a survey to learn how different people visualize different emotions as icons or symbols. \n\nIf anyone would be willing to fill the survey out here's the link \u2014 [https://forms.gle/wSbt6PWrVmY4otN98](https://forms.gle/wSbt6PWrVmY4otN98)\n\n\\*laptop required\n\n\\*\\*you do not need to be good at drawing for this survey\n\nThanks so much! :)",

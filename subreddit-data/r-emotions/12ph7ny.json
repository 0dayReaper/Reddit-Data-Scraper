    "postText": "So I have a lot of emotional trauma that has been formed over the years, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. Most of my emotions have been numbed beyond belief, like I know im feeling them I just dont feel them much. The point of this is I have 2 kinds of romantic love, the one I feel towards my girlfriend, its not as strong feeling more gentle but still emense, and then the one I feel towards fictional characters.\n\n The romantic love I feel when crushing on someone fictional is overwhelming, it's like nothing else. I suppose after years of replacing human interaction with the interaction of fictional characters I began to develope these two separate feelings of love.\n\n I guess the best way to put it is with my girlfriend I am in that state of married for 10 years and comfortable, in love but not bubbly and over the top most of the time. \n\nAs for my love for fictional characters, it's kind of puppy love. I am absolutely obsessed in every way, it has me going feral cause I am addicted to the feeling. Sometimes I worry \"are my other feelings not real, is this my real feelings\" But no, both are equally real.\n\n When creating my own world in my head to get over years of pain due to abuse, and other trauma's of the past I made this fixation to give me SOMETHING I always felt strongly even when I couldnt feel my other emotions. Sometimes I worry that I am so broken that I don't belong loving someone else, because I don't have that eletric love like I do for fictional characters. But I know in the end both loves are just as strong, they're just different from each other. The love that lasts is the one in comfortability, the puppy love won't go on forever and my girlfriend doesn't care that I am obsessed with fictional characters.\n\nJust a reminderer to everyone, creating connections to fictional things is not a bad thing if it helps you cope. Love comes in many forms and as long as you're happy and can continue to thrive then it can be okay to induldge in fantasy. Just remember to keep a line between fantasy and reality, I know the fictional characters I have these feelings for aren't real. My love for my girlfriend is the REAL love, so yeah this has been my moment of talking out my feelings about having 2 kinds of romantic love. Thank you for reading.",

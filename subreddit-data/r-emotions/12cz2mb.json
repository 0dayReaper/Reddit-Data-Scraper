            "comment": "Thanks for writing and sharing this so courageously. You do not have to be a womanizer but as humans, we do need social contact. Try to find ways of being social without involving sexual intimacy to see how your needs can be fulfilled by wholesome social engagement. Sports, interests and hobbies, volunteer work, supporting elders are all ways of being connected to a community and developing meaningful, fulfilling friendships which don\u2019t have to involve sex. See what this feels like for your emotional system. See what needs can be met with interaction on this level. And then you can maybe have more perspective on what tendencies might be co-dependent in relationships or outright dependent in seeking connection, validation, or other needs from partners. Invest in your own emotional stability and you will also gain clarity of what is truly YOU and what is simply a tendency to fulfill a need.",

            "comment": "To be a womaniser is to hate women. It's called unconscious hostility. Because if you treat a group of people like that, it means you also don't respect them at all in reality. I'm not surprised though, considering your core impressions of women are that they are unloving and hurtful. I also suffer rejection from my mother, it is no small thing. It affects your entire personality in small ways because subconsciously, or consciously as well, when you are young, your parents are like a 'life force'. Your body and mind knows that you can't survive without their love, food, shelter, warmth.  When that is kept away from you, it causes many personality traits that are problematic in adult life. You need counseling, and this will help you with depression a lot. To understand yourself is to be able to heal.",

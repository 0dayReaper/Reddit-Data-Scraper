    "postText": "How do I start, I was a womenizer before covid-19 lockdowns I have always know that I wanted a committed relationship, I couldn't have done that untill my ex girlfriend due to my fame as a womenizer back my hometown and most of the west side of my country. So after covid-19 lockdowns I was slowly going back to business as a womenizer untill my late father's passing away after exactly 30 days, so I got depressed for months mourning after my father and I was by myself since my mother never wanted me as a son and I didn't get along with my sisters, so I was in my shitty apartment crying, drinking untill I pass up cause I couldn't sleep at the time, then I met her my ex second women I fall in love with ever in my life, my definite soul mate, my fate, the one anything you would like to say when you met the one. She was living in a distance area of my country, and she was studying over board overseas so I didn't make a move, but I knew she was special from the beginning, I remember telling my friends I would like to be with her but I'm sure this won't work, untill one day I heard that she comes to my country for a week, I asked her out for a date immediately for my chance she accepted. So I packed out and went for 16 hours to get her town, it was love on first sight we started dating that day and it lasted more than a year. After 6 months I moved to her hometown to be with her as much as possible. After a while she broke up with me so here comes crippling depression again I am all alone in someone else's hometown literally with no friends and no family, and whenever I feel lonely, I want to go to pubs and pick up girls, and I'm scared to be a womenizer again, I don't want that life, the idea might be enticing to young males such as me but trust me it's not, no one respects you not other males or women you have intercourse with your reputation will go so low that will follow you untill you go somewhere no one knows who you are. I am not talented to make friends so whenever I feel lonely I think about that, but I really don't want to be like that again nor I don't want a relationship except if she would want to come back. It's been 3 months since we broke up, she blocked me from everywhere so I can't communicate with her, she's going to be overseas untill 2 more moths, I'm at her hometown waiting for her to comeback, without anyone to spend time with or anyone to support me by any means. What should I do? I am really depressed, and I'm afraid if I go that way again and lose anything but this loneliness risking my sanity.",

            "comment": "Thanks for writing and sharing this so courageously. You do not have to be a womanizer but as humans, we do need social contact. Try to find ways of being social without involving sexual intimacy to see how your needs can be fulfilled by wholesome social engagement. Sports, interests and hobbies, volunteer work, supporting elders are all ways of being connected to a community and developing meaningful, fulfilling friendships which don\u2019t have to involve sex. See what this feels like for your emotional system. See what needs can be met with interaction on this level. And then you can maybe have more perspective on what tendencies might be co-dependent in relationships or outright dependent in seeking connection, validation, or other needs from partners. Invest in your own emotional stability and you will also gain clarity of what is truly YOU and what is simply a tendency to fulfill a need.",

            "comment": "To be a womaniser is to hate women. It's called unconscious hostility. Because if you treat a group of people like that, it means you also don't respect them at all in reality. I'm not surprised though, considering your core impressions of women are that they are unloving and hurtful. I also suffer rejection from my mother, it is no small thing. It affects your entire personality in small ways because subconsciously, or consciously as well, when you are young, your parents are like a 'life force'. Your body and mind knows that you can't survive without their love, food, shelter, warmth.  When that is kept away from you, it causes many personality traits that are problematic in adult life. You need counseling, and this will help you with depression a lot. To understand yourself is to be able to heal.",

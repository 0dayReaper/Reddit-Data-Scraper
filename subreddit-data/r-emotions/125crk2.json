If my brain wont help me. \n\nill kill myself, but i fear. So ill go work at a burger king or something, thats a way to kill yourself without dying.\n\nSelf compassion, i still do not understand it. \nI can forgive myself, be compassionate with myself, but i know that wont stop, i will waste my time again.\n\nPlease someone, sos.",

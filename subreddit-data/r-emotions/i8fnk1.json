So if we had no feelings or emotions (same thing) we actually wouldn\u2019t do anything. The decision to calmly think about \u2018a cheating spouse\u2019s behaviour\u2019 rather than react immediately with anger stems from a desire to be calm and non judgemental. That desire is an emotion. \nI agree that a deliberate decision to be careful and considered in one\u2019s reactions is wise and laudable, and would probably protect a lot of children from the effects of divorce.",

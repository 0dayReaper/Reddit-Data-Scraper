    "postText": "Most of the violence , disputes , domestic ones \n\nI have come to a conclusion that 10 % of cases are of genuine that means the male guy abuses wife or lady without it being the females fault and I\u2019m not saying that it is right being abusive it\u2019s completely wrong but if you see it by human psychology\u2019s view we can get a better understanding why It happens..\n\n90% of cases : are the effect of riding the emotions , example : if a lady finds about husbands affair and she has kids , and she goes to the husband and threatens him or confronts him and now in this case the person is afraid ...feels threatened and reacts in a way to shield himself or correct term will be to Save himself or his reputation or his image , he acts in a agressive way most of the time to suppress the other person leading to abuses ,basically fear changes into agressiion and hence it can be termed as riding the emotions . \n\nIn this case the person is responsible and it\u2019s not the females fault at all this the 10% \n\n\nOther 90% \n\nEx : The female finds out she confronts , he denies matter moves on , but the female keeps on punishing him , and at this phase the male has already asked for forgiveness and life\u2019s moving by , everyone\u2019s happy , but the female still goes on reminding him , whenever she\u2019s angry or doesn\u2019t get what she wants she will use it as a trump card , again starts to quarrel , shouts in front of the kids about the same trying to manipulate in every matter ,even if the matter is right or wrong , it basically creates a mental hell for him ,then she then starts to blackmail him every time , leading to husband embracing emotion of anger in a lot of cases and abuse \n\n\nIn all of these cases children suffer the most , they are always frightened , troubled \n\nAll of these cases are the result of emotions taking over the consciousness , you stop thinking and start reacting with emotions , like animals ... \n\nWe must  Control  our emotions , think rather than react like an animal instantly \n\nThink before you react ..!",

So if we had no feelings or emotions (same thing) we actually wouldn\u2019t do anything. The decision to calmly think about \u2018a cheating spouse\u2019s behaviour\u2019 rather than react immediately with anger stems from a desire to be calm and non judgemental. That desire is an emotion. \nI agree that a deliberate decision to be careful and considered in one\u2019s reactions is wise and laudable, and would probably protect a lot of children from the effects of divorce.",

It\u2019s truly incredible how connected the entire body is, with the vagus nerve helping balance in the central nervous system.  If it\u2019s interesting to you, try some vagus nerve exercises for grounding and see if it helps calm the sensations of anxiety. It seems to help others (not medical advice.)",

The anxiety\n\nIt burns as I breathe in, my lungs breathing in the acidic heavy air \n\nIt burns in all the nerves of my body as I tense and relax various parts of me\n\nIt burns in my heart, feeling like some kind of heart attack\n\nNo amount of water calms the flames\n\nNo amount of medicine is making this go away\n\nSo I sit and I burn. Putting on my smiling face for all others to see",

            "comment": "Hey there, thank you for sharing this with courage. As a reader, I can really imagine how painful this might be. Are you familiar with the vagus nerve? It\u2019s truly incredible how connected the entire body is, with the vagus nerve helping balance in the central nervous system.  If it\u2019s interesting to you, try some vagus nerve exercises for grounding and see if it helps calm the sensations of anxiety. It seems to help others (not medical advice.)",

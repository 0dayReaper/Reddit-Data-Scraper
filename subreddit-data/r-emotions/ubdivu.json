    "postText": "For the most part I enjoy being part of a community, like a certain games or music, but something about it feels off if someone else is the reason Im in fandom. For example, I like bioshock but I feel like my brother likes it more and so i feel like I don't really deserve to say I like it since he fits the category more. Another thing I feel like mostly about video games is that I can't really get into a game I haven't played, it seems too complicated and like no matter how hard I try I can't get good or truly understand it, for example siege or risk of rain 2, This goes for about everything, movies, games, music. What are these feeling and why do I feel it?",

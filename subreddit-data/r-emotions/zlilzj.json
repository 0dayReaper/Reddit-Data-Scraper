    "postText": "I (22F) live with my partner (21M) in America and we are currently going through school. I have monetary help from my family, so we do not have a bad life. However, I'm not sure if I have an undiagnosed mood disorder or what is going on, but sometimes I get into this mood where I just want to burn my life to the ground. I want to verbally fight with everyone in my life, ruin my relationship by kissing random people I find attractive, and disappear into the night. I never do this because I know that I would ultimately hate the outcome, but I still get this feeling. I don't know what is wrong with me.",

Seek to learn from it and you can make peace with it rather than resisting it and making it an unwelcomed part that potentially surfaces even stronger to be witnessed by you. If you think you\u2019ll actually hurt someone or yourself, for sure, talk w therapist and please try not to hurt anyone. Hope that helps!",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a technique called Barral \u2018visceral manipulation\u2019 or abdominal massage, that\u2019s a part of many Osteopath\u2019s training. \nOur emotions and feelings are actually created by our solar plexus, a brain-like bundle of neurons and nerves in our abdomens, which sends signals to contract specific smooth muscles around our internal organs. Anxiety and stress are messages to make us act, to get away from danger, but often that\u2019s not possible, so these physical sensations continue.\nOver time, these muscles can develop \u2018muscle memory\u2019 which can perpetuate the negative feelings even though the original cause has passed.\nMassage and relaxation of those deep muscles releases their tension, just like any other muscle. \nIt\u2019s a specialised skill, but I personally know two people who have had 1 treatment each, from different osteopaths, and who experienced an amazing relief from anxiety and stress.   \nGoogle \u2018Barral Institute\u2019 for more info and call around some osteopaths to find one that uses this technique and has specific experience of using it for anxiety, as it\u2019s also used for other conditions like IBS and lower back pain.",

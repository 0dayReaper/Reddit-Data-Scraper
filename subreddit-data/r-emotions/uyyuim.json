    "postText": "Hello. I am 43 years old and I walk like this all day, feeling stress, anger, and even another person makes noise or speaks bothers me.My wife works at home and I listen to her keyboard when she writes and it makes me desperate and angry.I deny everything, and if I let my anger out and have a verbal argument with someone, I'm a beast and then I get a headache and feel bad for the rest of the day.Does anyone else have the same thing?I take pills for anxiety and depression, as well as Cbd drops, but even so, these events are very continuous.What dou you recommend Which doctor or specialty should I see?",

Anxiety and stress are messages to make us act, to get away from danger, but often that\u2019s not possible, so these physical sensations continue.\nOver time, these muscles can develop \u2018muscle memory\u2019 which can perpetuate the negative feelings even though the original cause has passed.\nMassage and relaxation of those deep muscles releases their tension, just like any other muscle. \nIt\u2019s a specialised skill, but I personally know two people who have had 1 treatment each, from different osteopaths, and who experienced an amazing relief from anxiety and stress.   \nGoogle \u2018Barral Institute\u2019 for more info and call around some osteopaths to find one that uses this technique and has specific experience of using it for anxiety, as it\u2019s also used for other conditions like IBS and lower back pain.",

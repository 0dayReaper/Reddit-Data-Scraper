I am conducting market research for an app I'm working on and would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThe basic idea is an app that, combining the power of art and the latest in science/psychology, uses expertly designed and curated audiovisual content to elicit specific emotions, allowing you to choose what you want to feel when you want to feel it and shift your emotional state at the click of a button.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts by voting or commenting. Thank you!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/z27ipx)",

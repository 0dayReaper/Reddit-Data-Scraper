            "comment": "It\u2019s very likely that your distress within the past relationship is a reflection of childhood feelings.    \nIt\u2019s possible that you consciously or unconsciously expected an adult relationship to offer the support and acknowledgment that you didn\u2019t feel as a child, but when that didn\u2019t happen it was a huge disappointment. \nCrying itself is both a way for the body to release stress chemicals and may be a signal to others that they want comforting.    \nCrying alone is all about stress relief.   \nMost people don\u2019t learn how to communicate very well as children, we learn strategies to get what we want and ways to suppress or avoid our sadness if we can\u2019t get what we need. Manipulation, anger, depression, passivity, control, these are typical of the ways we adapt to our environment as children, but honest,  open, effective communication is rare, because many/most adults don\u2019t have the patience or understanding to encourage that with young children.  \nSo have a look at Marshall Rosenberg\u2019s Non Violent Communication, it\u2019ll really help you understand how to both express your needs in a relationship and hear your partner\u2019s needs too.  \nAnd for the stress I recommend four things:   \n1)St John\u2019s Wort tablets or drops,     \n2)abdominal massage of the mid point of the liver, just under your rib cage, the physical point where anxiety and loneliness is felt,       \n3) vitamin B mix supplement and probiotics. \n4) watch/listen to and read whatever makes you laugh. Don\u2019t wallow in sadness, deliberately counteract it with laughter.",

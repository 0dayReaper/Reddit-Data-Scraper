    "postText": "Hello, I have a little problem. I was wondering if anyone have something similar to me.  \n\n\nEver since I was little kid, I had this feeling about industrial spaces, strange nostalgic feeling. Something similar to linear spaces but not it. Linear spaces gives me diffrent emotions. Linear spaces are empty, wierd and out of place, but what I mean by indutrial spaces (someone have to come up with better name xd), is for example office, warehouse maybe empty (or not) lobby or plaza, something similar what sub genre of vaporwave - mallsoft is. This feeling is connected more to places which you associate with work. I call this feeling/emotion \"teefism\", from Polish pronunciation of \"TF\" - Team Fortress 2.  \n\n\nFeelings of teefism in media:  \nsome maps from game Team Fortress 2 (most of them actually),  \nTV/Netflix series - The Office US,  \ngame Stanley Parable,  \nalbum \"Hologram Plaza\" by Disconscious  \n\n\nThere's probably way more examples but right now i can't think of any.  \nI know it's written rather clumsy and this may be hard to understand but English is not my first language. I hope y'all understand. I don't really know if this subreddit is right place for this post, but I don't know diffrent one which such post would fit.",

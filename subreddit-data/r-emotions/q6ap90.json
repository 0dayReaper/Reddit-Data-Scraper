    "postText": "I'm feeling so down about my self. For the past three days (especially but she does it all the time) I've explained to her that I just feel so ugly and it hurts my feelings when everyone keeps mentioning my weight. I personally think I look good and I like the way I look, but it seems like everyone has an issue and when I say something their always like \"you look great!\" Or \"I wasnt even meaning it like that!\" And it's just so annoying. Yesterday she said that I should go to a fat doctor (which I'm not even BIG!! Dang!), she said something about working out and now she just called me piggy after I ate something and it really just makes me want to go throw it up. Starving myself literally sounds like it feels better then having everyone always bring down my happiness. Idk. Just wanted to say something to somebody that wouldnt immediately go \"well, maybe you should start working out\".",

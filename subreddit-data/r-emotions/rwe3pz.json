We know each other on a personal level, so when I made what I perceived to be a light joke of it she bluntly said they\u2019ll be ending the call because of it even though I had given advice for how to fix what they were struggling with. I didn\u2019t feel like it was insulting enough to end the call and they followed up with them using my advice and how they improved with it. I don\u2019t know if that means I\u2019m clueless or insensitive\u2026",

So you need to look at your words objectively to know if you are just being direct in your words of if you really need to be more empathetic.   \nYou could also be avoiding feeling more sensitivity because you won't be able to deal with, so you block your feelings, so if this is the case, you need to gradually allow yourself to feel more sensitivity in balance to others and learn how to deal with.   \nIt could also be for other reasons that you feel that way!   \nTry to write down more examples to yourself and investigate them!",

I find I struggle to understand peoples emotions even though I have studied psychology and sociology a great deal. I can always dissect and study people but I lack the understanding. I can make fairly accurate guesses and assumptions but in the heat of a moments I feel detached.",

Growing up I was a runner because I knew I could fight but also felt it would be too cruel on my end since I was always bigger. That\u2019s followed me through the years and now on an emotional and mental state I chose to run. I\u2019ve created a storm of conditions I\u2019m bound to. Empathy and others emotions or even the process of deducing and registering emotions was never a thing I understood growing up. You have shown me a light thank you for that!\n\nI\u2019ll look into investing into a smartwatch. I\u2019m generally healthy since I\u2019m frequently exercising as an athlete but then again if emotions are spiking my HR I\u2019d want to know. I\u2019m not the type to hyperventilate, but feeling my heart in my throat is not foreign.",

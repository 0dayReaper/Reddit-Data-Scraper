    "postText": "My (14m) girlfriend (15f) said to me on Wednesday she\u2019d decided that since we\u2019ve been arguing and having lots of relationship problems she wants to go on a break ( not a break up) but she says we should act like friends and I\u2019m getting angry and upset about it. Like all of the small things like her calling me cute nicknames and cuddling and giving her kisses. It makes me so miserable. We have been on a break since Wednesday as she asked and I feel so miserable. I am anxious she is just stringing out a break up and even though we haven\u2019t broken up. I keep grieving the loss of the relationship, that has lasted for 1 year and 2 months straight, and is still going as of right now. Any advice?\n\nTL:DR I want to not be jealous and angry while me(14m) and my gf (15f) are on a sort of break (acting as friends)",

And what exactly are you angry about?\n\nDo you think your jealousy is justified? Usually we feel jealous when our relationships are threatened by a 3rd party.",

And she seems to give my friends more affection (only hugs) and they\u2019re not really happy about the fact it\u2019s all the time. When I ask to talk about what we could do to improve the relationship she often says she doesn\u2019t want to right now, leaves me on read, won\u2019t FaceTime or do it in person until it\u2019s almost too late.",

Must be quite energy-draining.   \n\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't put up with that now - but at your age I would have probably done it exactly the way you're doing it. We kinda have to learn how to deal with difficult people and situations. A concept I recommend checking out is setting up standards and deal breakers. Here is some inspiration on how to do that: [https://medium.com/heart-affairs/4-life-saving-strategies-for-handling-toxic-relationships-560753c1cd31](https://medium.com/heart-affairs/4-life-saving-strategies-for-handling-toxic-relationships-560753c1cd31) \n\nHope it helps!",

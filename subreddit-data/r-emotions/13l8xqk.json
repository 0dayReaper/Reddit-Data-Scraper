    "postText": "Hi well never posted on reddit before but I thought this might be good for me.\nI'm 26f and I feel utterly alone and my emotions has gone absolutely everywhere lately, mostly due to feeling alone. I came to the realization today that it's probably because I have become the back up friend again. The friend that people only call when they really have no one else. I have close friends and I know that but they all live hours away. And the ones I have close by prefer to hang out with other people. People tend to cancel on me lately and doesn't invite me to things. If I ever meet them I have to be the one to plan it and be the one to remind them about the plans for them to even show up. Today I had a total meltdown and cried for over an hour and I even scared my cats. Tears even start to stream as I write this so my spelling might be awful. \nToday I sorta want to end it all which is something I haven't truly felt for years. I never wanted to end up like this. And no contacting my family isn't going to do much either because they will make a big fuss about it and I don't need that right now. And I'm not willing to call a real friend either because I don't want to bother their happiness. I simply wanted to get this out of my system. Not that it's going to help a lot but it feels good to type it out. I hope your evening, morning or day is going a lot better than mine right now. Probbly going to keep listening to music, draw and continue to empty my liqour cabinet.\nHave a good one, peace out.",

Maybe try to make time to visit one of your friends, even if they\u2019re several hours away?  \nBeing lonely can be awful, but being on your own doesn\u2019t have to be. Each of us has to be our own best friend because in reality we are the only ones who will be with us every day, feeling what we feel and seeing what we see.   \nTry abdominal massage to soothe the seat of loneliness, the place where the feeling of anxiety is \u2018created\u2019, mid liver, just below your rib cage.       \nSome Osteopaths are trained in Barral visceral manipulation (abdominal massage) which releases anxiety and stress and feels amazing.\n\nTake enough vitamin B and drink enough (more) water and lay off the booze!  \nAlcohol stresses the liver, liver ache feels just like anxiety and your brain says \u201cthis feeling is loneliness because I don\u2019t have friends here.\u201d  \nTry St John\u2019s Wort drops or tablets and watch/listen to comedy.   \nTake a good probiotic mix, with Lactobacillus Reuteri, which increases oxytocin. Your feel good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin are mostly made and received in your gut. \n\nDo everything to lift your mood, like a good friend would, take yourself for a walk, buy  yourself some dark chocolate, laugh over a funny cartoon (Calvin and Hobbes works for me). Hug yourself until a friend hugs you.",

Maybe try to make time to visit one of your friends, even if they\u2019re several hours away?  \nBeing lonely can be awful, but being on your own doesn\u2019t have to be. Each of us has to be our own best friend because in reality we are the only ones who will be with us every day, feeling what we feel and seeing what we see.   \nTry abdominal massage to soothe the seat of loneliness, the place where the feeling of anxiety is \u2018created\u2019, mid liver, just below your rib cage.       \nSome Osteopaths are trained in Barral visceral manipulation (abdominal massage) which releases anxiety and stress and feels amazing.\n\nTake enough vitamin B and drink enough (more) water and lay off the booze!  \nAlcohol stresses the liver, liver ache feels just like anxiety and your brain says \u201cthis feeling is loneliness because I don\u2019t have friends here.\u201d  \nTry St John\u2019s Wort drops or tablets and watch/listen to comedy.   \nTake a good probiotic mix, with Lactobacillus Reuteri, which increases oxytocin. Your feel good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin are mostly made and received in your gut. \n\nDo everything to lift your mood, like a good friend would, take yourself for a walk, buy  yourself some dark chocolate, laugh over a funny cartoon (Calvin and Hobbes works for me). Hug yourself until a friend hugs you.",

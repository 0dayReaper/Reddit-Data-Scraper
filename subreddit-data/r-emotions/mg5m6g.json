Am I supposed to have a fancy job at 17?? I really wonder if I\u2019m making a lot, it is to me. Anyways what\u2019s the word for it",

Job, car, house, opinions, looks etc, if someone else\u2019s opinion and words makes you doubt your own beliefs and feelings that\u2019s insecurity. \nIf you like your job and feel that the pay is adequate you don\u2019t need anyone else to put you down.\nYour relative is a jerk.",

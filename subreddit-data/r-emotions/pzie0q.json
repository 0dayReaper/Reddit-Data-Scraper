A few months ago I felt so nostalgic about Avatar series as I couldn't be able to complete this as a kid and I felt so gud and nostalgic about the show. Even after so many days I kept loving it and feeling gud about it but now when I see a video or soundtrack of the show I feel no nostalgia at all! As if its nothing and i dont care. I do feel nostalgic abouut other shows but i feel like the whenever i watch a gud show or movie which I luved at that time I feel nothing after a while since I have grown. Like no more nostalgic memories anymore. Its devastating . Im 21 years old btw",

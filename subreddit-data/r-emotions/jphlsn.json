    "postText": "Do you ever feel like your so many people, with so many faces. I\u2019ve been living with my parents and I just feel like I can\u2019t be my true self around them. So it\u2019s hard to get in touch with who I am. I truly am a sensitive cry baby who wants to hug the whole world until it\u2019s healed. I feel like I have to toughen up and I act more bitter and sarcastic around my parents which has developed into my identity and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s who I am. I feel so confused, sometimes I feel so full hate and over times I\u2019m about to burst with love even for the ones who have done me wrong. I am always ebbing and flowing in between a state of knowing and unknowning. I know your not supposed to know in life and it\u2019s all about the discovering but I guess I just don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m discovering aspects of myself that much, I feel so disconnected. I hate it",

I mean i\u2019m a calm person but i use so much energy to keep myself that way. I feel i can burst easily if I don\u2019t hold myself. Why am I writing this right now? Because i feel overly emotional and i feel the need to get some of them out.",

I\u2019ve learned tho anger ussualy masks greif or sadness. I\u2019ve been trying to pin point what I\u2019m so angry about and it\u2019s mostly myself and people in my life, like my parents and I try to find forgiveness for them and myself. I am so disappointed and ashamed of who I been in the past and where I am at in life! I hope you can find ways to release your pent up emotions, it\u2019s super necessary and you deserve to let them go! Feel free to write on this post whenever things come up!:)",

It\u2019s exhausting, I\u2019m exhausted from it which is why the older I get, the more important it is to find people who value your feelings and/or learn to be a lone with them and channel them. I\u2019d rather have few people and be by myself than have to be someone I don\u2019t wana be to make others comfortable! Haha  feeling it today! :P",

It normally works but when im depressed, I\u2019m so numb that I don\u2019t fee anything, that\u2019s when I Exercise to sweat and get blood flowing or find some way to make me cry like listening to an emotional video that I resonate with! But yes! I really think we can transfer our emergency and transform them to something more positive! Music really helps me! Everything has a frequency and if we tune in to certain frequencies, they can raise our vibrations I think!",

Yes probably, or longer. \n\nAlso, if you comment on your own post without choosing to reply to me, I won\u2019t get notified for your answer.",

Not that I feel it on a level that I consider feeling but rather based off of how I\u2019m thinking about the situation. \nI\u2019m not understanding how I process them? If that\u2019s the right way of putting it. Idk how on a scale to my emotions to other. And if they would scale it the same as mine.\nWhen I think about my emotions on a scale to everyone else\u2019s mine is a 4 on the scale to 10",

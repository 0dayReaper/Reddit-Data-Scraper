    "postText": "Hello there, my name is Caleb. I often am told that i am \u201cemotionless\u201d or that i have \u201cblank emotions.\u201d i often wonder to myself why this is. I don\u2019t cry... ever. In my eyes crying never makes any situation better, it is pointless. When people tell jokes that make the majority of people listening laugh i can\u2019t help but wonder to myself \u201chow is that funny?\u201d I also am not affected in the littlest by insults. They do not hurt me. Is there any reason for this. I have been wondering about it a lot lately. I cannot remember the last time i laughed at something. Is it psychological or something? My mother laughs very often and cries. My father does not laugh much nor cry. Could this be inherited from my father? I would like to know if anyone can answer. Thank you.",

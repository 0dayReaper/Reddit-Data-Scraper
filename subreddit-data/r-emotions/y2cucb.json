    "postText": "There is something about grieving that makes many people feel guilty too.\n\n* Many people end up feeling guilty in their grief and some are more prone to it than others.\n* It's natural to self-reflect and question past choices and actions after losing a loved one. This can form a breeding ground for guilt.\n* Those who are low on self-compassion and generally inattentive to their own feelings may be more affected by \"guilty grief.\"\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202210/why-grief-is-breeding-ground-guilt](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202210/why-grief-is-breeding-ground-guilt)",

    "postText": "I have been observing since I was a child, the cause and effects of emotions. I chose to stop feeling them for a long time, but now my close friends have observed that it is affecting my ability to connect with others on a certain level they want me to be. Every time I allow emotions in, it hurts me. How do you cope with the pain emotions come with?",

            "comment": "You say you understand emotions, then you know they are just signals connected to your own values and beliefs. You expect things related to your values and beliefs and that's what's probably giving you the most emotions.\n\nYou expect certain things will happen when connecting with others. Yes, emotional things will happen, but that's normal between people because we all have different values and beliefs. And sometime they are opposing each other.\n\nUnderstanding that everybody is responsible for their own values/beliefs, own thoughts, own emotions and own behaviour is crucial. So you are resposible for your own emotions.\n\nYou need to change your mindset, that's how you cope.\n\nThere's 2 you's. Your logical you (neo-cortex part of the brain) and there's emotionally you (limbic system).\n\nYour 'logical you' can tell your 'emotional you' that it doesn't need certain values and beliefs anymore. You can train your [caveman brain](https://herstwellness.com/blog/2019/11/when-your-caveman-brain-takes-control-learn-to-recognize-your-reactions-P6rna) (limbic system) to change.\n\nYour 'logical you' can tell you 'emotional you' that your friends think/feel/behave they way they do because of their values created by their life experiences. That's having empathy.\n\nWhat helps a lot is having control over your 'emotional you' thinking negatively. You can gain more control over your limbic system. Train being mindfull and meditate.\n\nSelf awareness / self control / self development and wisdom is crucial to living a peaceful / restful life. You'll have a less negative emotions and a happier life because you understand yourself better (what values and beliefs are driving you to certain emotions).\n\nHope I wrote this down in a understandable way.",

I've noticed after a while you'll notice parallels and the essence of what it's all about.\n\nExpand your wisdom. Good luck!",

Last resort is to compartmentalize all together and ignore emotions and stick to logic, my current resort",

Emotions and feelings are the same thing, they are \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 physical sensations in the muscles around our internal organs. They\u2019re created by signals from the solar plexus, the \u2018abdominal brain\u2019 also known as our _mind_ and every decision we make, every choice, every deliberate action is as a result of how we _feel_ about it. Without feelings there is no motivation and no action.",

I'm struggling right now too, with fear, sadness and anger, but all you should do is try to be your best self. In your anger, try your hardest to be kind. Go out to a park or cafe, and if you interact with someone wish them a good day. I know it sounds stupid, but trust me, being kind and receiving kindness truly brings out the best in us and helps us come to terms with the reality of our situations. \n\nI wish the very best for you. Take care of yourself, set a schedule, and keep busy. If you are wasting time away like I have for the past months, try help someone else if you can. Look at what local shelters are around for homeless people or animal shelters, and offer your hand. You will only be appreciated, and will only do what you are willing to.",

I don't really think of ft everyday or wanting to be close to him bc of how are distance is. I think of those two things not that very much. My past experiences didn't work out because of lack of interest on their side and no communication as well on their side. This is my second relationship long distance. I am not expecting anyone to change to suit me, if he doesn't want to ft then we clearly won't FaceTime I am not forcing him to do anything he doesn't want to but we also haven't talked about it with each other. We have the same attributes and we both accept each other for who we are. my whole comment was about how to ask him and what should I do, not break up with and see how my relationship isn't good for me because my love language is physical. We do fine with long distance and we are just growing as one, so yea this is a good relationship for me .",

If you both agreed to FT but he won\u2019t/can\u2019t do it then all you can do is ask again and explain that it\u2019s important to you.   \nA relationship in which one person has to try to persuade the other to do something they don\u2019t feel happy to do is always going to be stressful.",

I am not forcing it or haven't really thought about how important to see my significant other through FaceTime since recently. I still haven't talked to him about it either yet because it can be stressful like you said and I don't want the stress to happen.",

Just because I wish for something to happen and he doesn't want to, doesn't mean its not compatible. I can now see that this is a wish that I want in my relationship. If this wish doesn't come true that is ok. I am not gonna break up with him since he doesn't want to FaceTime me. As long as we talk through text I am fine with that. I am not forcing him to FaceTime or anything. It hasn't been a big deal for us but I have been thinking about it recently. Would I like to FaceTime yes but like I said it isn't a big deal if he doesn't want to.",

    "postText": "I'm really struggling with my self worth since having my baby. \nI'm 2 weeks post partum, I had to deliver my baby via c section because my past trauma made vaginal birth not an option, I tried, but every exam I had would end in me hyperventilating in tears, absolutely beside myself.. I remember the day before my daughter was born when we made the decision to have a c section the head doctor in essence told me i was weak for not being able to go through with a vaginal birth. I was standing there like a fucking idiot still crying and he looked so disappointed in me. I gave into my trauma and let it ruin something that was meant to be beautiful. \n\nI was so fucked up when my daughter was born, I was too drugged to focus my energy on meeting her, instead I had to focus on trying to stay awake and breathe because they double dosed me with whatever the fuck the drug was called that they used. I wasn't the first one to hold my baby, I was paralysed on a table with my belly cut open. I barely remember hearing her first cries, I only know I heard them because there is a video and I can see I was awake. \n\nI look at myself in the mirror before every shower and I can't recognise myself, my body is so disgusting, I have a massive scar across my belly to remind me of it. I'm so scared that my partner isn't going to want me anymore. I've been trying to give him as much of me as I can to validate myself and convince myself that he still wants me, but I'm scared that isn't true, to no fault of his. \nI'm scared that I'm not enough for my daughter, I'm scared that I'm not doing enough, and that I'm going to fuck her up like I fucked myself up. \n\nI'm trying so fucking hard to be happy, because I should be, I should be over the moon with my little miracle, I should be feeling nothing but love and happiness right now. \nWhy is this so hard..",

You are amazing and what you see in your self is only a monster you've created in your head. It is not your fault. Nothing is. Let your body have a rest, that scar holds so much power because you created a human which is incredible! do you realise how strong you are? Your beauty and your true self isn't defined by your scars and current body and your partner knows this. Open up to them and express your self. You are a beautiful person with a beautiful pure heart and your partner sees it &lt;3 life will get better you'll get trough this. Loads of love and hugs",

You need to make sure you\u2019re taking extra B vitamins, calcium and magnesium for anxiety and stress and drinking at least 2 litres of water per day.  \n\nSt Johns Wort is a natural remedy for stress and depression which I believe is safe if you\u2019re breast feeding. (But bear in mind I\u2019m not a doctor so best to check for yourself.) \n\nYour feelings of anxiety are being created by your solar plexus, stimulating specific smooth muscles around your internal organs. Your solar plexus is responding to your imagination and your thoughts respond to your feelings and together they create a \u2018feedback loop\u2019 of self sustaining input.  \n\nSoothing and relaxing those internal muscles with massage is an effective way to interrupt this cycle. Sore, tight muscles in our backs give us chronic backache; sore, tight smooth muscles around certain internal organs give us anxiety and dread. You can do this for yourself:\nTry a circular, clockwise massage of your abdomen, breathing deeply.  \n\nMany osteopaths are trained in the Barral technique of abdominal massage. It\u2019s used for IBS, backache etc but also for anxiety and stress and people I know have felt blissfully happy after one short session once the stress is massaged away.   \nRepeated sessions might be a good idea if it works for you, to maintain peace and calm.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/science/complex-and-hidden-brain-in-gut-makes-stomachaches-and-butterflies.html\n\nAbout visceral massage:\nhttps://www.barralinstitute.com/therapies/",

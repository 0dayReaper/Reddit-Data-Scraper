    "postText": "I don't know why but when someone is extremely happy sometimes I picture them getting disappointed and i feel really sad. I don't know why i do this. Maybe I overthink too much. When people around me are having a good day sometimes I feel scared I'm going to mess it up and I become super self aware and anxious. I don't understand. I wish I could just be happy for others. But it's mainly for people close to me since I'm hardly around anyone outside the house. Maybe I'm just scared they'll get let down. I feel like a party pooper but I never show these feelings.",

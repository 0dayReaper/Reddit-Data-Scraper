Sometimes I wish the Flower Power returned. Love \u2764\ufe0f and peace\u262e\ufe0f. I want people to be good for themselves and each other.\n\nI know I can just focus on happy stuff and make myself feel better. But still I just know about all the bad stuff going on in the world, millions of people suffering..\n\nIt's 2022 and thare are people who are still slaves...\n\nI could have been born in a total different part of the world and be one of those people.\n\nCan't wait untill the time that money is not worth anything anymore. No more companies and different countries, just one whole society that helps each other in being happy. The purpose of life is to just be the best version of yourself and do the things you love, so you'll also add to making a better version of the whole society.\n\nOkay, the last part was just my fantasy going on the loose... does help to get that sadness away.",

Doing your small part to help. In whatever way you can. This is the best of the human spirit and it\u2019s the only regenerative action to counter the negative.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m literally struggling to feel anything at all and I feel like that\u2019s more exhausting than feeling everything really intensely. I used to feel way too much, it was horrible. \nFor the past 2 years thanks to covid I have no friends, no aspirations and no energy. Ever. \nI wake up every morning and wish I didn\u2019t because I know how hard it will be to get through each day struggling to feel anything, and when I do feel all I feel is negativity. Anger, sadness, hopelessness, anxiety. It\u2019s a hellish existence. \nI can\u2019t talk to anyone, either they\u2019re emotionally unavailable or they don\u2019t care. Sometimes I struggle to muster the words that convey how I\u2019m feeling anyway, explaining it seems like a massive effort that 90% I can\u2019t be bothered with. \nI tried to kill myself once before and I\u2019m not sure I ever really regretted it, I think about it so much but I can never quite bring myself to do it. It was like that the last time too it\u2019s sort of builds up until I just breakdown. \nI just need a friend and I don\u2019t have any so I keep it all inside until I can\u2019t cope anymore. \nThe thing that makes me want to scream is so many people would care if I killed myself but don\u2019t want to know when I\u2019m still alive and screaming for them to notice. \n\nI\u2019ve just run out of hope and I don\u2019t see any way out for myself.",

            "comment": "Hi. Well this all sounds pretty grim. We\u2019re all controlled by our feelings and it\u2019s all too easy for isolation and stress to drag us down. Of course it would be great to have a close friend who is always there for us and on our side, but there are things you can do for yourself. The reality is that you are the person who will be with you every day and share every experience and you need to be your own best friend first. You have to think what you would do to help someone else and do that for you. Because of our powerful imaginations us humans can persuade  ourselves into depression and we can persuade ourselves out of it too. \nFrom my past experience of being very very low I can suggest some things that helped me.   \nFirstly, water and diet. Dehydration and lack of essential vitamins and minerals (esp vitamin B12, D3, calcium, magnesium, iron) are significant causes of physical stress and that stress does manifest as negative feelings.   \nExercise. The more strenuous the better. Brisk walking outdoors, running, indoor workouts, aerobics, pushing your heart rate and breathing hard. It\u2019s impossible to feel strong emotions while exercising hard and it releases feel good brain chemicals.   \nComedy. Watch, listen to and read things that cheer you up. Take any opportunity to lift you mood, even by a little bit. Calvin and Hobbes worked for me.   \nCut out caffeine (switch to decaf coffee and tea), drink lots of water (a good 3 litres a day, including tea/coffee) with a pinch of Lo salt in it (reduced sodium, with potassium) to maintain electrolyte levels. Cut out over-processed food and excess sugar, which stresses the body and creates short highs and long lows.  \nOne other thing, our feelings (good and bad) are physical things, created by the solar plexus (the abdominal brain). It\u2019s connected to the smooth muscles around our internal organs and those muscles can be massaged to release their stress. An osteopath trained in the \u2018Barral Technique\u2019 would be a good place to start. It\u2019s also known as \u2018visceral manipulation.\u2019  \nThe point is that if you don\u2019t have a friend available right now you have to be your own best friend. Step back and look at yourself and say \u201cThis person is struggling. I can help.\u201d   \nOf course find a sympathetic therapist if you can, but do what\u2019s needed to look after yourself physically too. It makes a huge difference.",

My point is to try and find an anwnser once more that will improve my issue and secure myself for my future and present duties. \n\n\n\nIf you see my reddit account you know that I've been dealing with a lot of random mental issues my entire life, i mean since I started this account, and honestly I've just realized that emotions are very fake and I mean fake in the sense that it's just chemicals, it's just chemicalsz the entire emotional spectrum, the emotional range of the body is just chemicals, it's no different than the stuff that builds muscles, it's no different than the chemicals that the body uses\u00a0 from food. it's all chemicals inside the brain system, like right now I feel inspired I feel hopeful I feel bright I feel like I can take over the world I feel like everything's going to be fine, i feel like i want to help everyone, i fell like i can work without issue and stop when i truly need to and it's all because I took adderal XR, before adderal didn't feel like doing anything, I was bored, i was uninspired, I couldn't do anything I didn't even want to do\u00a0 practice problems because I study engineering. \n\nSo the fact that I feel so knspired, so good, so peaceful so beautiful , like life has suddenlt become this beautiful thing the fact that I feel like that all those emotions that people crave, that the guru's and meditation guys and the alpha Sigma redpill movement and all sides and opinions on this topic others\u00a0 promote and seek to achieve, That all those steps and being healthy and all that is perfectly replicated through the increase of dopamine releases, through a goddamn pill. The fact that a pill made by some guy in a laboratory years ago, the fact that a specific\u00a0 combination of elements with certain bonds, the fact that this certain combination when you put it in your mouth and when\u00a0 is digested and goes to the brain Through the blood, the fact that is what makes me happy, makes me feel complete and productive like logically goals and values  should make  the fact  that a goddamn superficial material combination of some lifeless elements, the fact  that  it makes me make me feel like I felt before in my life im cherished moments, it's just, it's horrible to me for me it's it's just it shows that the entire human body is a fake and superficial machine that operates on chemicals and thats it. It just shows the reason why most old religions have to this annamosity towards the body, they have this repeated core ideas that the body is this ongoing problem that you need to control, that you need to manage, that you cannot let control you, and honestly I get it, the entire body and the mind is its own thing. I've never been so convinced in my life that the mind is different from the person l am.\u00a0 Like I am not my brain, I am not that organ, because I say I'm going to be fine and work today,\u00a0 I decide things,  and the mind just does a different thing.\u00a0 There's things I want to do out of values, out of purposes, out of goals, I have things I want to do and my mind says no. my mind says no and it's clear that it's not because it has some hidden reason in some deep soul subconscious beliefs. no it's really because of some automated systems. The Subconscious is really just a sponge of impactfull and extreme feedback from certain experiences, and thats like that probally because during primal times we needed it to remember what overall and general things we need to do to survive, to grab the most impacful experiences and form values and beliefs. We need it to remember the overarching survival tasks, to remenber the people we need to take take care of,\u00a0 we needed to remember our survival mistakes and our survivor flaws etc, that initial information that shapes us deeply is based on the assumption of the best survival. That worked in primal times because that was necessary for survival in the wild.\u00a0 The body's is just an slow evolving system that is currenly outdated and simple science and logic explains this: The time we have lived it's nothing compared to the millions or hundreds of years that we lived before proper civilisation. It's alarmingly uncomparable, we have lived almost nothing of out of nature life and that explains why this system that the brain has is so outdated. That explains why the sponge system of the subconscious only catalogs the extreme and big experiences without seeing its value instead of absorbing meaningfull, educational and valuable experiences without regard of impact. That systems just screws you over If you let it work on its own and endlessly fights you if you try to 100% control it, try to change it eymtc.\u00a0 To say the most basic sample of this terrible subconscious system is when you get bullied by some guy thats probably regretted his old decisions and hes a way different version, just because he bullied you with his friends or sum just because of what happened so long ago that it was impactfull because you where a simple kid, then the subconscious grabbed that logically trivial experience outdatingly assuming it will help yoy fight wild lions in the future, and constructed this entire belief and action system based on that truly small stuff, it creates an entire survival rule like its a primal survival. And when you realized what happened it already too late it will take years to reconstruct that system, most people won't even notice until it's too late most . logically it should nor mean nothing to you it's just a child getting bullied because of misguided kids that are probally more clueless and stupid that the kid getting bullied. Is a easy logically solvable thing and yet this single thing shapes your entire life if you don't deal with it\u00a0 if you don't realize how the subconscious work and most people won't realize that because most people don't have the money or don't\u00a0 the source of the correct information. Most people auto-destroy their life and they never know what it is and then in reality it all comes down to a single series of stupid events of your childhood. in adolecense, or a time that passed very far away from you are right now. it's so dumb.\n\n\nAnd in terms of supplements and being healthy doing exercise and the usual good stuff that gets promoted which\u00a0 is considerably better that was promoted now a days by the media which is just utter destruction and bad pharma products consumerism bait and promoting everyone to be , weak,\u00a0 obese etc. it's considerably better ofc but at the same most of It ignores the truth about being healthy and doing exercise (ive been doing heavy lifting based workourts since 2020, I don't have an super visually impressive body but I do have a capable body,\u00a0 I've worked phtsically and I have an argriculture project, I've done a lot of labor by myself, 16 hours minimum of labor when I have to take care of crops, i consider myself\u00a0 decently strong, at least for that job, im better than the average male today, at least in my country, and not to shit on those people I know there's a lot of problems nowadays and they don't have the information so im not saying I'm better than them or hating them, they maybe better than me but dont have the right tools. But I know what it is. I know what it is to be healthy)\u00a0 It does something, but it does something in a way different sense from whats promoted, what being healthy, doing healthy habits, taking supplements, spending time in nature, having good natural based nutrition, what all that does is just expands your limits, expands your mental capabilities, making you physically abled, create new habilities. But all that mean will shit if your mind doesth use them because all that gets passed throght and organized using the same outdated mental systems that you did have a choice and vote in.\u00a0 if your mind and body doesn't want to use those upgrades, if your body doesn't decide to organized all that the way you want it too, it won't matter, ill feel like you have been eating hamburgers your entire life and have terrible habits. Even though you're doing the right things. Though and it will feel like nothing has truly changed in the brain's systems and emotions, that's why you most people just gave up, because they don't feel any difference they're still depressed or troubled.\u00a0 I'm mad at the people that promote those all those things using the most wrong and confusing interpretation of mental systems, is not that they dont know what they are saying, its they dont know or ignore the fundamental flaw of\u00a0 mental processes, and that is: the outdated thought structures (the thought classificafions, useless parameters, unchangable genetic mental aspects that truly change when a new human is born, the forced importance that the brain gives to this genetic blueprint and that refuses to change when faced with its products, like inlogical thoughs, life performance damaging beliefs.\u00a0 I could go on but my point is not to sell a hopeless message or a hopefull message.\u00a0 My point is that me personally I want the people that have tried to help me on here to understand the reason I say the things, i want them to understand what I live and I'm not saying that im way like oh I'm so depressed or woe is me.\u00a0 Like that's not what I'm saying\u00a0 I am asking for help but I don't expect help, and i shouldn't be helped at this point because I've been posting all this mental problem of me and people just get tired of my shit and I get that.\u00a0 So I don't expect to be answered I don't expect people to read this at all but my point is that whoever reads this I hope you understand\u00a0 my issue I hope you understand that and I hope you can give me an answer I hope you give me an answer that i will listen to finally, and the blame is on me if I don't listen to that to that answer, not on you, my stubborness made me not accept it. \n\nI am very aware that this is very self centered behavior and I do not project this onto people, many people don't know all this and i think is for the best because they don't deserve to know all this.\u00a0 They have been way too good to me and they should receive what they fought for.\n\nI know its weak and arrogant to say that i am a victim of my mind, and im willing to accept the falseness if that, but i cant see how is it false, i cant see how its all me, that i decided to harm myself when when i know thats unlogical and has no true reason.",

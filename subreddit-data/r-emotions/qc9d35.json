Chest pain is a usually linked with emotional problems which is your body's way of processing the same emotions. For example I can feel sour and bitter taste in my mouth when I hear something disgusting, and I feel stomachache and pressure on my chest when I have anxiety attack of emotional distress",

            "comment": "For me, I feel pressure in my chest for two reasons. \n\n1) ive been working for way too long and I need to stop \n\n2) more commonly, emotion repression. Which is my habitual coping strategy of hiding and avoiding negative emotions.\n\nPay attention to the times you feel pressure in your chest and begin to track the patterns. What commonality do you see when you start to feel pain? What external events took place, 30 mins, 60 mins, 3 hours before hand? How did you respond to that external event?\n\nMaybe a more important question is, what way do you currently use to regulate your emotions?\n\nFor me, I didn't know my way of regulating my emotions until recently. I just ignored them and ignored my feelings. This is a method of emotion regulation. An ineffective one, but still a method none the less. It took me a while to become of aware of it.",

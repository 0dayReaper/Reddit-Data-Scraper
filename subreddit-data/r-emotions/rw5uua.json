    "postText": "I've been feeling this since childhood that I will never get over... There is a feeling that I cannot explain using any words and that cannot be expressed with words like it is clogged up. It has been disturbing me recently as it literally feels like my actual soul and I need help, it's not sadness, happiness, confused or anything like that plus I am a healthy person. Can someone please explain if possible this extremely odd emotion that feels like is apart of my body. It can be both a positive and negative catalyst for some reason. If it is not an emotion but rather a mental illness can someone please say.",

            "comment": "Feelings/emotions are physical sensations caused by contraction/stimulation of the smooth muscles around our internal organs.  \nThey\u2019re controlled by nerve fibres which come from the Solar Plexus, also known as our \u2018Abdominal Brain\u2019. This is why expressions like \u2018gut feelings\u2019 and \u2018gut reaction\u2019 are actually accurate.  \nThe purpose of these physical feelings is to motivate us to action. Thoughts without feelings are not motivating. Over millions of years of evolution our species has developed a system of internal, physical signals to provoke action in response to external situations. We have lots of names for different emotions but they all come down to either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. We feel motivated by these feelings to seek out \u2018good\u2019 and avoid \u2018bad\u2019.   \nWhen people talk about the \u2018mind\u2019 or our \u2018unconscious\u2019 it is often this that they\u2019re referring to.   \nThe Solar Plexus contains a lot of neurons, like our head brains, but no imagination, so it will respond to our head brain\u2019s memories and imagination with physical feelings too, even if there\u2019s no real, external situation at that time.  \nI don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re feeling, because you\u2019re unable to describe it, but if it\u2019s a feeling then it is literally a part of your body\u2019s physical motivational system.",

            "comment": "I think I can relate, cause I also have had some feeling which I could never describe. I would just call it \u2018weird\u2019 and that\u2019s it. Not sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about is equivalent to my weird sensation though. I used to experience it way more often when I was a child, but now, in the early adulthood, I don\u2019t really feel it anymore. So basically it\u2019s like I hear few voices in my head? Or that my thoughts go way faster than reality does, than I move and respond. Sort of a feeling of disconnection from myself. Or that I am controlled? This feeling would go away pretty fast though. Arghh it\u2019s hard to describe, I have no idea if my explanation is near the actual thing lol. I used to think it was schizophrenia but hmm I don\u2019t have hallucinations so yea. Weird",

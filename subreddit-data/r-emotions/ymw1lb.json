    "postText": "Hello, i'm typing this to ask a personal question although it may not be a big deal once i'm no longer 'heated' but it's really getting to me at the moment. I have just come off a call with one of my mom's friends who couldn't get to her so they called me to give the phone to her. Now I personally know these people, I grew up with them as my aunts and uncles, but it doesn't sit right with me that when they can't connect to her phone that they go through me like i'm some kind of phone line operator.\n\nLet me be more clear as to why it hurts. Ever since covid I realized how 'not present' my mom was. She's something of a work-a-holic and ever since she was allowed to work from home she had been in meetings and calls all into the late night of 2am to fix something. Now I know she has to work to earn money but sometimes I just wish to be able to talk to her a bit without waiting on her to get off a 3 hour phone call.\n\nAnd back to why her friends going to me irritates me. They were also the people she had/currently worked with. I know they are her closest friends but why is it that they get to bypass having to wait when I had sit in silence patiently to just talk to her in our own house? While sat beside her in the car? When we went to a place together? Even when I had felt sick, I had to wait. Even when I wanted to us to at least get some bread and eggs to sate our hunger (i have a cousin and younger sibiling here too) as she was too busy to go to the supermarket, i waited (until I couldn't). Even when she suddenly left the house without telling us that we'd have to find our own dinner tonight as she hung out with her friends, i waited for her to return so I could let her back in the house.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? I'm so afraid that if I voiced my feelings to them that they'll think i'm rude and not tell me if something bad happened to her. We (my mom and I) are already something of acquaintances in our own house, do I have a right to be upset or this unreasonable? Should I just wait until I calm down and forget about it? I don't know how to feel right now.",

            "comment": "Ofcourse you have the right to be upset.\n\nYou need a good conversation with your mom and tell her what bothers you and the both of you have to come up with a sollution so you'll feel better and she feels better too.\n\nFirst, read a book called Crusial Conversations. It's a good read and you'll get to learn some strategies and skills from it. You'll also get to learn how to communicate in a way that you'll both get the best out of a \"difficult\" conversation. I quote, because after some practice these conversations are just conversations to have a better relationship.\n\nAt the end of the conversation both parties understand each other better and come to a sollution that both feel good about.\n\nNext, try to understand preciesly why your mother is the way she is at the moment. How does the feel? What is important to her and why? Is she taking care of herself? How is her physical, mental and emotional well-being? Is she happy? What are problems that could keep her awake?\n\nWhen you know a bit more about her needs, start talking about yours (the book had helpful tips how to have these conversations). And if you notice your mom isn't good at these conversations, give her the book after you've read it.\n\nBtw, your mom is just a person, who might be on auto-pilot. Thinking she's doing all right by you and just carrying on. Usless you correct her, she'll just go on the way she's used to.\n\nNever think it's rude to tell your mom about your needs. She is your caregiver. She needs to tend to your basic needs (as long as you can't take care of all your own needs). I just say to my gf \"At the moment I don't feel loved by you.\" And I explain why I don't feel loved. Sometimes my feeling is incorrect, because I expect stuff from her and see it as normal, while she puts her energy into improving my well-being in a way. So I stand corrected. Best is that the feeling goes away and I feel loved again.\n\nGood luck and after reading the book you'll understand much more about yourself and the way you (can) communicate.",

I know she's stressed so I didn't want to add to it but in the end it causes it's own problem doesn't it? Communication of how we felt was never our strong suits I noticed, so i'll try it. Again, thank you, have a good day!",

                            "comment": "Stress is nasty and stress causes conversations to be more emotional (because stress activates the emotional area in our brain), so be aware. If things go sideways in a comversation, it's a stress reaction and probably not the way your mother would like to feel, behave and speak.\n\nYou'll both love each other more when you both tell what you feel. Maybe explain why you want to talk more about your feelings (of the both of you), because you want to be loved in the way you need and love your mother in the way she needs.\n\nTell her you've noticed she's stressed and ask if she tends to her needs (enough rest, relax moments) to destress. And maybe ask her if you can have a relax day together, because you miss her (you miss her filling your needs).\n\nYour mother doesn't have her boundaries set up, so she'll stress herself. You can warn her, but usually people need to hit rock bottom before they think: \"Hmmm, maybe I've exploided myself a bit too much... let me set some boundaries, so I'll feel better again.\" If your mom is in her 40s she'll find out soon enough.\n\nAnd really, after reading the book I experimented a lot in conversations and I noticed more the message behind a conversation. It's like you get another sense.\n\nGood luck and I hope your relationship with your mother improves and that both of you can really share and bond emotionally.",

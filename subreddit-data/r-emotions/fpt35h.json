I am an artist/musician and I\u2019m having this annoying sense of doubt come over me when I\u2019m creating music it is so frustrating. I constantly feel like I\u2019m not good enough or like I shouldn\u2019t consider myself a musician. I\u2019m frustrated because this(myself) has been stopping me from creating music I want and expressing myself which is even more frustrating. I don\u2019t know what to do. I love music and I\u2019m doing the best I can to learn the tricks of the trade but I feel like what if I won\u2019t get to where I want to be.",

            "comment": "I know exactly how you feel. I actually ended my last band just before releasing our first ep on spotify, because I couldn't bare the self doubt and pressure it put on me. I write a ton of music myself, but it's very periodic for me. I feel better in the periods I write/play music, and I get depressed and selfhate a lot when I don't. And when I don't it's really hard to get into it again.\n\nWhat I need, and think you might need too, is a rutine in music. Just like putting on clothes, brushing your teeth etc, you need to play/write music for just 15 minutes a day (which often will become way more) and you have to do it even if you aren't inspired. Just play something for 15 minutes, if nothing happens, cool, you've practiced a bit, and that's good.\nWhen you get that rutine you'll get music in your life on a daily basis, which makes it easier to not fall in the holes.\nShare the music you write - good or bad, with your friends - maybe even with me, and get the boost of self confidence they'll give you. Think about your creative friends, maybe one is a painter etc and think about how cool they are to you. That's how they see you too with your music, but they'll only know if you share it with them.\n\nYou deserve to be proud of what you do with your creativity, and you should be. However those emotions you're feeling can also help you in expressing yourself. Just keep writing/practice/play just a tiny bit every day, and I'm sure it'll help you in some way. \n\nSorry for bad English, it's not my first language.\n\nPeace",

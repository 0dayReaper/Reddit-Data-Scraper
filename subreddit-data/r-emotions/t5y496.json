    "postText": "Why the heck would someone who ghosted u once, find u again and then ghost u  a 2nd time...\nI feel so damn frustrated, hurt, confused, pissed off, used, deflated, rejected, stupid, rebuffed, tossed aside, ignored.  I just can't believe he has totally blanked me! It's shitty and it sucks like a kick in the gut!  I really believed this person cared about me in some way.. \nI guess I overlooked the signals, I believed, trusted him and he promised, assured me he woukd not run again, ghost again, would talk to me, be honest with me.  He knows very well it hurt me the first time... \nI miss him and am so disappointed at the same time..\nI don't know how to handle it, I write, create, have cried, tried distracting myself...\nI lost him before and it seems again..but I don't want to let go..\nIf he contacted me I would listen and feel relieved instead if just hanging wondering x I miss him",

We want to believe people are a certain way or what we perceive is correct.  \n\nConcerning him, I believe and trust he cared for me and that he wasn't intentionally setting out to hurt me a second time.  I also believe he considers it easier or best to just slip away without a word.  But, he knows it hurts me deeply.\n\nI self reflect alot, and I'm trying to deal with the feeling of loss all over again x",

But I wonder if holding an unrealistic view of him would make it very difficult to have a good relationship even if he was around. We all know how difficult it can be if someone has a bad impression of us based on a rumour or misunderstanding or poor communication. But it can be almost as difficult when the other person thinks we\u2019re someone we\u2019re not, but likes us. Being misunderstood is not a sound foundation for a relationship, even if the other person has a positive, but wrong idea about you.",

I accepted him completely, flaws and all.  We all have imperfections and flaws.  Lack of communication and handling things inconsiderately yes that I agree with.\nBoth him and me are both overthinkers, he maybe thought it was best this way.  But honest dialect would have been better x",

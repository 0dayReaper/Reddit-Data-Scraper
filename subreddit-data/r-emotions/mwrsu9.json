Which are created by negative experiences or trauma.\n\n- When values are not met you feel emotions.\n- When beliefs are attacked you feel emotions.\n- Negative beliefs cause anxiety.\n- When expectations are not met you feel emotions.\n\nEmotions feel worse then being tired of emotions, so we tend to follow our values, beliefs and keep our expectations.\n\nThis causes stress, which causes you to go on autopilot and hang on more to your values, beliefs and expectations.\n\nSo....\n\nAre you tired? Are you taking care of your wellbeing? Are you taking the right choice or the emotional choice?\n\nChoose you, not your imposed values, beliefs and expectations if they are not to any use of your welbeing or others.",

It's really well explained in a workshop about how to communicate with others. Search for Marshall Rosenberg San Francisco workshop on YT(it's quite humorous!). It can really help, and has really helped me. Wish you all the best.",

Sadism has nothing to do with it.\nIt's another way of actually being there for another person. \nAs an example: Instead of just agreeing with the sad person, and trying to make them feel better, you can be there listening to their pain, and stop trying to fix the pain - only themselves can fix their problems, and they'll just need a rock to lean against. Hope you understand what I am saying, otherwise you should definitely watch that video - he really describes it well. Hope you are doing well.",

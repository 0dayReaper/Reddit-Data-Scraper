    "postText": "**If you like this post follow me on** r/Crimsonpill\n\n**Introduction:**\n\n**I deleted my Tinder and Bumble a year ago and never looked back**. I have been waiting to write this essay for a long time. I mostly let it go at the time. However, now that I've become a Life Optimization Mentor and no longer a PUA, I feel I can be freer to talk about these types of topics.\n\n**1-Most of these apps are filled to the brim with other guys!**\n\nFree apps like this make the entry barrier very low, and it floods the app with tons of guys. Hence the ratio is stuck against you. I would say there's 80% of guys to 20% of girls. Even if you have are a good profile, most likely, it will be overlooked.\n\n**2-There's tons of \"low-value guys' there who will creep the girls out**\n\nFor instance, once I met a girl who I cold approach off the street. We hit it off well, and afterward, she showed me her tinder. Most of it was \"low-value guys' who messaged her \"wall of text\" messages, and the girl would keep it to make fun of it. You might say, \"Bro, but I don't do that.' Yes, but it creates a \"culture\" where men are chasing, and women have an abundance.\n\n**3-Tinder and Bumble, with all their boosts, are making money off you guys, promising you matches when they won't deliver in reality.**\n\nTinder and Bumble have all these extra boosts and subscriptions to make you \"stand out.\" It is similar to the lottery, where they promise you results if you keep buying. In reality, you will be paying much more than you paid for other types of apps. Since each time you run out of boost, they'll ask you to pay more. Moreover, you will be paying much more than if you upfront got into a paid app upfront in the long run. Some friends and I did an experiment where we got a lot of boosts, and we got matched with women who were looking for followers for their IG and or following them on Snapchat.\n\n**4-90% of the women who use this apps are using it only for validation and have no intention of meeting anyone**\n\nHave you noticed that most women on those apps don't reply. I talked with many guys, and their experience has been that they'll match with a girl, and she'll do low investment answers or won't respond. Or some others will ask you to follow them on Snapchat or to sign up for their Fancentro.\n\n**5-The small minority of people who are having any success are using \"cheat codes.'**\n\nIn the eyes of most PUA coaches, you guys are broke; hence you can't get on a paid monthly app. Therefore they have to keep plugging some of the terrible apps like Tinder and Bumble since they know it's accessible to you. Moreover, from what I heard there are all sorts of cheat codes you can do. However, if you do this, it will most likely get you banned from multiple apps(it has happened before) and tarnish your reputation.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n**Using apps like Tinder and Bumble will instill low self-esteem in you.** You will assume that you are not \"high value\" enough. You also see this with PUA coaches and Internet marketers when they'll show in their videos all the matches that women make so that most students think there's no way I can reach that level without the help of the coach\\*\\*. But it's an illusion to keep you on the Ferris wheel.\\*\\*\n\nA friend put all his same pictures from tinder to a paid dating app got tons of matches. He also tried that same trick on Instagram and the good results. There are tons of alternatives to using these types of apps like Instagram, Couchsurfing, Onlyfans(it can be done if you know what you are doing), and other paid apps. If I were in your shoes, I would save money on paid apps($100 a month) and **have the ratio in my favor.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t56h0391jh61.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b7acde32d0a428f9cf11ea469dda21bf879fe3af",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for sharing and having the courage to seek support. Have you been able to express anger in the past? Sometimes we have to open that channel with practicing anger as anger is less accepted than other emotions (by society in general but also in family units or other environments). The good thing is, expressing anything (crying) is already a great outlet for the anger that\u2019s trying to find it\u2019s way out. A general exercise you might want to try is getting into a safe environment, alone and standing up.. see if you can feel angry and march forward one step at a time in a posture that feels like it wants to express. Do it slowly and let it build. You can then pound on some pillows or stomp your feet on the floor to help it express. Just giving your body permission and physical cues like this can help it to come out. (Not medical advice)",

I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re in this circumstance but here\u2019s what you can do to work on the anger. \n\nAnger comes with two parts, the first one is the physical impulse and aggression. The second part is a message to communicate. Both parts we have to find a healthy way to express.\n\nFor the physical part, see if you can find a safe place to be alone and expressed the physical impulse in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else. If you really feel like hurting someone, use that energy to beat up a pillow or some thing that won\u2019t hurt you back. Stomp around the floor. Push the air in front of you. Twist a towel up very tight and squeeze it. All of these actions will give the physical impulse away to express. You can come up with your own but of course the key is not to hurt anyone or to hurt yourself, or to get into trouble by damaging or breaking things.\n\nThe second part, the message part or communication part is some thing that wants to be said out loud. So while you\u2019re doing these physical expressions, you can say what you need to say out loud. Maybe you want to shout it or scream it, or just scream out in general. This will help the message part to express.\n\nAfter trying this a few times you may find that it\u2019s a relief to express this way, and it may trigger some more crying which is normal and healthy. Notice how your body expresses and if it becomes unmanageable in anyway, find a way to get back to safety by box breathing. Inhale for three seconds hold for three seconds, exhale for three seconds hold for three seconds. This is a really good safety anchor when you need it.\n\nNot medical advice and if you feel like you\u2019ll hurt someone, or yourself please call one of the crisis hotlines we mentioned recently. They are awesome resources!",

I hope it helps to give you some ideas of how you can explore how expressing this anger works Personally for you. You may need to try several things before the right practice feels right for you.",

It can be super helpful with the support and strategies to get through this stuff quickly (or as quickly as possible.) \n\nA somatic trauma trained therapist typically knows a lot about emotions and how to move them out of the system, so some balance can return.",

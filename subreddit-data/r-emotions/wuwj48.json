    "postText": "So I get to work this morning and there is a butterfly on my door. Doesn't seem to be moving so I try to get it on a piece of paper.  it started to walk a little bit and got itself into a good spot on the paper.  I got it some water in a bottle cap and a leaf to have something.  Just talking to the little butterfly has me getting teary-eyed and for some reason started crying super hard because I found out it was most likely dying.  Now, I want to say I almost never cry, and when I do it isn't ever over a butterfly.  Ive read that it could be me pinning emotions and feelings of something else to the butterfly situation and my brain just wants me to work that out by crying over the butterfly.  But like, Why did I get so ridiculously sad over the butterfly?  I currently have him with me in my job on a piece of paper and THANKFULLY I'm alone in the building.   Doesnt really move unless i try to bump him with the leaf, then he will walk a few steps and go back to chilling.",

And it's sad that the butterfly is not doing okay. And I think part of you also knows that the world is not okay and the butterfly represents all nature.\n\nI get sad too, that's why I try being kind to the environment. It's only very hard because our world seems to be build around plastics and stuff that's bad.\n\nIt's okay to be sad and know why we are sad, but we shouldn't stay in the sadness. The only thing we can do is live a life that's kinder to earth or even improve her.",

            "comment": "Maybe it helps to journal about it, esp why you feel sad for the butterfly. Journaling can be really incredible exercise for these underlying answers to show up. Maybe try writing about it in a free way, just ideas and thoughts about how you see it, what it means to you, and then see if any of that seems relevant to your own perspective in life. If you start crying over one topic maybe it\u2019s time for that topic to get some support, attention from you, or maybe it\u2019s a build up of other things that\u2019s just healthy to express.",

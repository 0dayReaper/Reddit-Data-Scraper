And it's sad that the butterfly is not doing okay. And I think part of you also knows that the world is not okay and the butterfly represents all nature.\n\nI get sad too, that's why I try being kind to the environment. It's only very hard because our world seems to be build around plastics and stuff that's bad.\n\nIt's okay to be sad and know why we are sad, but we shouldn't stay in the sadness. The only thing we can do is live a life that's kinder to earth or even improve her.",

            "comment": "Maybe it helps to journal about it, esp why you feel sad for the butterfly. Journaling can be really incredible exercise for these underlying answers to show up. Maybe try writing about it in a free way, just ideas and thoughts about how you see it, what it means to you, and then see if any of that seems relevant to your own perspective in life. If you start crying over one topic maybe it\u2019s time for that topic to get some support, attention from you, or maybe it\u2019s a build up of other things that\u2019s just healthy to express.",

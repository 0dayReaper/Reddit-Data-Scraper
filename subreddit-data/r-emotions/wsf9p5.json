The links I see are: crying is an act of emotional relief which frees up circulation in the body\u2019s energy system (and more circulation helps arousal.) Also, crying can be an act of vulnerability and emotional intimacy both of which can foster connection and arousal with a partner. Really is individual type question as far as I know tho.",

Nothing more.\n\n\nBut I don't see why you should worry about being normal anyways. Open up to the people that should know. Embrace your nature. It doesn't seem to be harmful on its own. Some wouldn't care or could get used to it... Probably some that get excited by the sad/horny emotional combo. Find a trusted partner for exploring that. Or explore it in your imagination.\n\nHowever \nIf destructive behaviors and thoughts are tied to the sad/horny emotional combo you're exploring, you may need to take measures to keep yourself safe. That's for you to decide.\n\n In my experience, purely embracing your nature is important and also creative. If destruction is happening instead tho... something is off. You owe it to yourself to understand yourself.\n\nIf that's the case, I suggest limiting yourself in some way in order to better understand the push and pull triggers for your emotions.",

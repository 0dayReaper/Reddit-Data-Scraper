I even go angry when I am talking to someone for more than 7 minutes. and I am starting to hate one of my family member's voice to. And I also am scared of everything around me. Included my brother.

            "comment": "The first thing that popped into my head when you mentioned fear and anger was that the amygdala (almond-shaped brain region) is involved with the experience of these emotions. It\u2019s normal for it to grow while you\u2019re growing up but i\u2019d look into abnormal growth and what triggers it.. but besides panic attacks there is also such a thing as anger attacks that not necessarily have to do with abnormalities in the amygdala",

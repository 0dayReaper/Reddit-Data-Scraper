    "postText": "I know that everyone doesn\u2019t hate me. I have friends, I have a social life, I am confident in myself. But when I think about how other people perceive me I can only think about my worst traits and that they must not like me/are waiting for me to leave. When I look at myself (physical appearance, traits ext) I am think that i look good or am funny but when I think about what other people think of me I am ugly fat annoying ext. \n\nI also have extremely hard time being vulnerable to people. Even people I\u2019ve know for basically my whole life. I am so scared that my friends all hate me. I\u2019m scared of being looked at and discarded. 18 m btw sorry if there bad Grammer I needed to get this off my chest:)",

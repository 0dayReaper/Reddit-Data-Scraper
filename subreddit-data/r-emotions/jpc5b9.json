Just doesn't care. Just just not care if I am alive or dead. I am just fucking dazed. Can this happen if she ever loved me in these 18 years. Is this real? Can this happen? Some one please convince me this is normal...",

            "comment": "Hi. It sounds like you\u2019re hurting a lot. \n\nYes, it is normal for other people to behave in ways that we don\u2019t like, want or understand. Most of the times, the other person is incredibly hurt themselves. This means that they might need to temporarily withdraw in order to re-establish a healthy foundation for themselves. This can be incredibly hard to accept, but that is the best you can do for her. Let her figure out what she wants on her own terms. In the meantime, you can remind yourself that your self-image is not depended on how she sees you. It\u2019ll be much more helpful for you to make sure you can see yourself as you are - the good and the bad. \n\nNone of this stuff is easy. But it\u2019s incredible important.\n\nYou two are no longer together and therefore need to establish healthy lives for each of you. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be in each other\u2019s lives, but first you need to create a new life for yourself while giving the other person space to figure it out foe themselves. Even if that means the other person works through their hurt and anger in ways that might make us feel ignored/invisible.  As Long as you can appreciate yourself, the actions of others won\u2019t impact you as much. \n\nGood luck!",

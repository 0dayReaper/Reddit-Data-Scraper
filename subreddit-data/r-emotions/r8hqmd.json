    "postText": "Over the course of two years the pain has eased. Yet, the feeling of heartbreak is always there. As I see friends on here go through similar situations, my heart breaks. I just want to cry for them, with them. I never thought a day in my life would stay forever in my brain.\n\nWhen I think about not having my collar, it saddens me. I begin to grieve all over again. The pain from that day comes rushing back. The smells, the sites, everything surrounding that day. The sad thing is, I secretly knew it was coming. I just never wanted it to end. For a moment in time I was happy.\n\nAs Snapchat and Facebook remind me of these memories, I find ways to delete the pictures. All I see is a happy person wearing her collar with such pride. The feeling on my neck is the emptiness of something that once was.\n\nI am trying for the first time to allow myself to feel and deal with the hard emotions. I have compacted them away for so long. Now, I have the freedom to express them.\n\nThe other day a friend stop by to help me. The best thing they did was offer me a hug. It did all I could not to just bust into full tears in that moment. I can\u2019t remember someone giving me a hug and it didn\u2019t feel cold, loose, or a quick hug goodbye. This was a hug of comfort. wipes tears away I have been dealing with so much lately. That hug for just a moment was taking away the pain.\n\nOver the course of this past week I have had haters. From asking me about a beard I can grow to watching my language on Facebook. All sorts of shit in between. I had wrote things here and there to remind people to be kind. The thing is, these people don\u2019t realize the impact it causes on someone.\n\nThis past week I have felt so ugly, fat, insecure about my body and my face. I have not want to be seen by no one. I am normally ok with my body. I have come to love her most of the time.\n\nPCOS causes my hair everywhere. My weight is extremely hard to lose. I have tried so many times over. If I told you how much I weighed, you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nFor nearly 20 years I was told not to sit on peoples furniture because of my weight. This was in my own home I was told this. I was told by my neighbors not to sit in their things either. I might break it. When things happened in my personal life, these feelings came rushing back.\n\nRemembering how fat I felt when I was at my smallest. Remembering getting judged by someone in this community about my hair. Realizing I can only count on me.\n\nWhen my friend came over and offered me a hug, the feelings and emotions wanted to escape. I suppressed them for the most part. Part of me heard \u201cyou are not allowed to cry\u201d. Even though he wouldn\u2019t ever say that. It\u2019s a demon of mine.\n\nOver the course of a week I have been crying when I can. Crying as type up this up matter of fact. For the first time in a very long time, I\u2019m allowing myself to feel emotions. Maybe I\u2019ll get another hug like that. If I do, they should prepare for tears.\n\nFor those of you who know me outside of here. I love you and I have been beyond thankful for those who have helped me these past couple of weeks. Through my tears and mental health struggles. Even with some things I still keep to myself. I am learning it ok to cry, even in private.",

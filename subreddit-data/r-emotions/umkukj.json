You can\u2019t change what happens, all you can do is change your beliefs about them.\nExample: some dirtbag makes a comment about you that is inappropriate.\nYour could tell yourself \u201cit\u2019s terrible he\u2019s making fun of me, that really hurt me, it just can\u2019t stand it\u201d and go onto tears and anger\nOr you could tell yourself \u201cthat guy needs to put down people to feel good about himself, how pathetic! I don\u2019t like his comments, but I can handle this kind of thing\u201d and go on calm like a boss.\nThat\u2019s the way I see it, works for me.",

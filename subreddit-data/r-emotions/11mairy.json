    "postText": "Today I did one of the hardest things in my life. I admitted to my boyfriend that I have a hard time coming to terms with my emotion as I have for so long used logic to handle situations. This is as a result of my somehow being able to as I like to call it seal my emotions up for a long time as I was afraid of being hurt ever again by people around me. This made me feel numb and so I decided to try see if I can feel them again. After about 1 year I was finally able to feel nearly all my emotions. But here comes a problem, at times I am unsure which emotion I am truly feeling and so it makes me frustrated. And with time I had come to realize that some emotions can be confused for others and so it takes quite a while to truly understand the emotion I am feeling and what caused it. This at times makes me unable to properly explain some of my behaviors and reactions. So to ensure I do not hurt him in any way of form I usually do not project any emotion I don\u2019t not know what it is and what it stems from and when I know the emotion I feel at the time I usually think through any action I am to take after wards as I really don\u2019t like making people uncomfortable. And his reaction hurt me. He sounded frustrated and he said that this made him view our relationship in a different perspective and he at the time did not want to say anything harsh. In all honesty this hurt me as I had spoken about a very vulnerable part of myself and all I wanted was understanding.\ud83d\ude05 could someone help me understand where I went wrong.",

            "comment": "Vulnerability is the root of true intimacy. If he's uncomfortable, it's because he doesn't understand. Since you have a hard time understanding it yourself,  he's probably feeling unstable. He is probably reprocessing a lot of memories he has with you.\n\nGive him time. Tell him you want to work with him. Say you want to grow together. Say you are happy to talk more.\n\nI'd say that you should continue to be vulnerable.  Admit when you're scared. Admit when you feel guilty. Admit when you're ashamed. Letting yourself come to terms with your negative emotions, gives you a path to move pass them. To find a bigger picture and see your experiences in a new light. \n\nSupport yourself the way you would support a dear friend. \n\nYou are a logical creature for sure. You are not crazy. You are perfect. You are free.",

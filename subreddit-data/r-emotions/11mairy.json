Since you have a hard time understanding it yourself,  he's probably feeling unstable. He is probably reprocessing a lot of memories he has with you.\n\nGive him time. Tell him you want to work with him. Say you want to grow together. Say you are happy to talk more.\n\nI'd say that you should continue to be vulnerable.  Admit when you're scared. Admit when you feel guilty. Admit when you're ashamed. Letting yourself come to terms with your negative emotions, gives you a path to move pass them. To find a bigger picture and see your experiences in a new light. \n\nSupport yourself the way you would support a dear friend. \n\nYou are a logical creature for sure. You are not crazy. You are perfect. You are free.",

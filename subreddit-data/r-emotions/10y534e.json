Life is pretty dynamic huh? \n\nMany moving pieces and the image I always come back to is, the picture of our planet moving in time/space.. basically nothing is ever the exact same, so my eventual lesson was: appreciate what you have when you have it. Even if it\u2019s not perfect. Work on my inner peace and even if the outside world is turbulent I can have at least some elements of calm and peace inside.",

Look at the leaves moving because of the wind. It moves because of the wind. The tree will almost always survive a storm or a strong wind because it sways into the direction of the wind. It's like seeing a tree or even its leaves not resisting the wind reminds me that every little thing in our life (every wind) is all PART of life (the plan). I always realize that just like the tree, we are all here on earth just moving towards our fate. It reminds me not to resist. To just be in the moment, to just be in the present.\n\n2. Look up at the stars at night. Looking up, you'll see how little you are, how big the world actually is. Oftentimes, I get a feeling that this is what the world looks like to me: my problems with work, with acads, with friends. But when I look up, everything just fades because I realize that what I think my world is not THE world. The world is so much more than what I think it is. Everything just fades.",

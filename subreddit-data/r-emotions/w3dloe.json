Sometimes it just feels like you were never truly you're own person because of external sources that just sucked the soul out of you a long time ago. Feels like you'd be better off just being a reanimated flesh and blood with *NO* thought process other than just mindlessly just doing.",

Meditation is cool, lately I'd been doing and watching self-soothing activites. Typing calms me down since I'm a fast typer, watching other forms of life calms me down, and being in windy and quiet secluded places calm me down... their all things I do to escape.",

    "postText": "It feels like \"you\", who I describe myself as, was already \"dead\" \"murdered\" at a young age, it feels like when you were a helpless little boy you were just targeted and chased by these 3 demon like figures who just... decided to come in, target you, and torment you because you were just a hopeless and defenseless little boy who didn't know any better since you were just a boy. It feels like they possessed you, and have controlled you for life, it feels like your soul was just sucked *STRAIGHT* out of your body and had just been a puppet to their doings. It feels like you have a *PHYSICAL* body, not a soul, and you're physical body is the *ONLY* escape from such feelings. The most you're ongoing and on moving physical body could do is cry for help, from these feelings that are just becoming more and more apparent because of the way things are forced to be. You start to realize these feelings are just *SO* much more apparent and have just taken control of you to the point where it feels like it can't ever be \"stopped\", just somehow somewhere taken to a place where they'll actually be shut down temporarily, where you're original in-born soul actually comes back and returns but only shortly.\n\nNow that original \"you\" is back, that original \"you\" could FINALLY go to a place where your original human nature can return and finally be felt, without those demons taking complete and total control over it. That original \"you\" is saved in the sense that it's finally in a safe space where those inner demons get interrupted from shortly... and you're not very super wary of it. But as you get older, you feel like *WITHOUT* those feelings... it just feels like you're in a state of purposelessness... since these inner demons had already done the damage and you've either forgotten or are already truly broken with who you already are. It feels like now that I've grown up, and realized these inner demons more... it feels like I've come to realize that without such feelings... I truly do lack meaning and true feelings since I had already been \"killed\" by them in a sense... it's like I'm just a thing that could walk and talk, not a sentient being with feelings much at all. It feels like when you were finally taken away from those safe spaces where such inner demons *DIDN'T* finally come back to get you since they weren't shortly stopped, you're just hopelessly screaming for help, hopelessly screaming for another human being to help you escape from those feelings... but even then, it still feels like it's not doing enough to \"eradicate\" those unwanted feelings.\n\nAnd then, in a state of mind and a state of being where you're just \"being\"... those inner demons still slowly eat you inside, but you just wanted to do things that finally make them become more apparent and eat up your soul because you've made piece with the fact that it really is the thing that's always dictated and define your purpose. So you do, and go places where loneliness, anxiety, and depression become even more apparent as possible to the point where it becomes \"FUN\" to do such activities.",

Sometimes it just feels like you were never truly you're own person because of external sources that just sucked the soul out of you a long time ago. Feels like you'd be better off just being a reanimated flesh and blood with *NO* thought process other than just mindlessly just doing.",

Meditation is cool, lately I'd been doing and watching self-soothing activites. Typing calms me down since I'm a fast typer, watching other forms of life calms me down, and being in windy and quiet secluded places calm me down... their all things I do to escape.",

    "postText": "2 days ago i planted crops, yam crops. It was a great where people came for free to help, friends. I worked my ass off all day after they left and i did something that is a first step to helping my country and starting one of my dreams.\n\nAnd today. I feel angry and im bothered by my mind that i didth talk to a girl. And a im mentally unable to fucking see that i fucking planted yam and work my ass for an entire day like a man with people that helped me for free jus because i liked it.\n\nIs like one part of my mind its in hightschool and the other one is in his 30s.\n\nI would like to kill the hightschool part.\n\nAlso, that feeling of clearness, uncaringness and peace  that you feel after masturbation (the feeling where you dont care about dumb hightschool shit anymore), how can i replicate that using supplements or drugs?\n\nIm 20. Is this a 20s thing? Will it ever go away? Will i stop caring about stupid relationship shit and college friends and just be happy with what i have now? I really dont want to reconcile my dumb feelings with my ambitions, people keep telling me thats the only solution.",

Respect for starting on one of your dreams too!\n\nWhen you say you\u2019re angry about not talking to a girl, is there someone you wanted to talk to during the yam day, or is this separate?",

Did I understand that fully, properly?",

Life offers quite a variety of experiences that can be dizzying at times and feel like a rollercoaster. You\u2019re not alone on this. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to have one day at the top and another day feeling so low, sometimes without a good reason or explanation. It happens and hey, hang in there. \n\nThe reason I used the words empowering / disempowering is bc it gives you a way to understand what you\u2019re feeling and to be more in control of your life.\n\nInstead of viewing a section of life (a few days, weeks, even years) as an absolute success or absolute failure, try to just notice what you want to celebrate about yourself (wow! I\u2019m actually good at leading or making my ideas happen or inspiring others..) and notice what you\u2019d like to get better at (I\u2019d like to build my confidence or abilities in approaching women for example.)\n\nThis way, you can be developing more centered and grounded power over who you are and who you want to be, rather than getting thrown off and disempowered by the fact that there\u2019s always a mix of things happening. (And often times don\u2019t yet make sense.)\n\nThe more you develop skills with one thing the more empowered you will feel about that topic .. of course the less stressed you feel about that thing.. then there will prob come other things you\u2019ll feel challenged by or would like to get better at. \n\nAs long as you realize you\u2019re in control and can be responsible for your own development, you\u2019ll be moving more towards your self (and also moving towards more clarity.)\n\n2. You can get checked by a doc for mental health and hormonal balance which may be useful to find treatments that bring you more clarity. But also understand that this uncertainty is part of being both a young person and a conscious person which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Being aware of yourself is a good start. And being young, your hormones are altering how you experience the world, which yes, will settle down in time. Taking pills to solve problems will tend to leave you less empowered (and ultimately more frustrated) unless they are exactly what your body needs. \n\n3. At the age of 25 the brain is fully mylinated (connected in the neural pathways.) Until then, your learning, connecting, making mistakes, experimenting, associating and developing your concept of the world. So.. at 25 things generally start making more sense and .. use this important developmental time for yourself to build healthy habits for mental and physical health and know things will get better when you move in the direction of support. (As you already have with your post.)\n\nThese are generalizations of course and not life advice or medical advice but I hope they\u2019re helpful!",

So it\u2019s ok and natural even to want unreasonable things. Welcome the feeling even tho it may not make sense, for bonus points, ask the feeling \u201cwhat do you have to show me/share with me?\u201d Welcoming what\u2019s happening in your mind will at least dissolve the resistance to it. (One reason meditation works so well.) Of course you still want to act on things that empower you and not act on things that may be disempowering (harmful or hurtful, etc.) for you or for others. Is that helpful, at least in part?",

Mindfulness: just sit and be with the feeling. See how it feels in your body. If it\u2019s uncomfortable see how much you can welcome and allow to be there (it\u2019s a part of your self that\u2019s surfacing). Treat it with compassion rather than pushing it away. It\u2019s a part of you after all that has some kind of intelligence to share with you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s surfacing. Embodiment: Rather than sitting, move your body to emphasize it and explore the feeling. Use your hands to define the space it might look like in shape (is it flat, round, gigantic, tiny)? Where does it occur in your body? Emphasize that and see if it\u2019s ready to express something (maybe crying is the way). If you really want to build a relationship with yourself that\u2019s centered with clarity and capacity these are some helpful exercises. Not a definite thing for all but worth trying to see what feels right for you.",

And the reality is that im not fit for relationship, ive never been, not even with regular friends i do things well, my friends are resources, they are not there to hear me out but rather to help me or i help them fullil goals for an organization, my other friends outside this circle i barely talk to them cuz i dont have much to talk about. \n\nPoint is im not there yet, and i dont have time to practice. I dont want to secure a partner cuz i dont need  to right now, my brain does not understand this. My last relationship with a woman ended with obsession and me acting like a clown. That shit told me im not fit for this, but the brain in its infinite wisdom managed to safeguard me to prevent what happened all those years ago but at the same wants to engage in it again. \n\nWhere the fuck did evolution fuck up so hard than noe the brain is irrational. \n\nMan this shit is so invasive, it literalky STEALS motivation from me, it fucks me over, ruins my day and i cant do shit about it. Honestly is cruel what my mind does to me. Maybe is mad that i treat her like shit, but i will stop when she stops. \n\nOne side of me wants to do my shit and just do it because its whats nessesary, the other side want people to kiss my ass and love me.",

One moment I'll be very dedicated towards my goals of what I wanna achieve in life and the other moment I'll start bothering about why I don't have many friends. Have i done something wrong or do I repel people. Or should i have to talked to that guy or agreed to go on a certain date. So such thoughts pops up in my mind too. I'm also in 20's btw. I don't know if it is 20's specific. But in my case I think it is because I usually feel lonely. I think these thoughts are common and we should not try to completely stop them. But instead we shouldn't let these thoughts overpower the main goals of our life. We have to constantly remind ourselves of what is actually important for us to do. Socializing sometimes could be also good for ourselves. But remember one thing that doing what you like is more better than chasing people.",

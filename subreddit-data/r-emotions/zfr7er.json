    "postText": "I watched an anime recently that was super cute that follows two high school girls as they meet, befriend each other, get close, and it's implied that they have some sort of romantic feelings for one another (in my opinion). It was so adorable and it made me so happy watching it, but it felt bittersweet.\n\n Like as happy as I was with the show, and as much as I loved the characters and story, I couldn't help feeling sad because of it. I guess I'm just looking for some insight or suggestions as to why I'm feeling this way, because it feels important to me that I understand this feeling.\n\nFor anyone who's curious, the show is called Machikado Mazoku, otherwise known as The Demon Girl Next Door. The first episode is pretty over the top, and some of the other episodes can be a bit much, but I just connected so much with the characters that its flaws simply didn't hurt the experience for me.",

            "comment": "Sometimes art and entertainment can lead us on emotional journeys that aren\u2019t necessarily significant to our everyday life. For example, I may be led on a wild car chase and crime story that is very engaging to my body, senses and emotions, but ultimately isn\u2019t relevant to me. So before you dig too deeply, consider it could just be a beautiful and bittersweet story that was well told. If you want to understand why you felt so compelled by it, maybe ask what elements of the story you felt most called by. Write them down in a list first of emotions, then the characters, or the situations. Write what plot twists or developments occurred to you as most compelling. Then take a moment to look at what you\u2019ve written and see if anything is thematic for your life. Maybe it helps you realize a similar feeling or connection to a topic that\u2019s happened to you or is something meaningful for you. Hope that helps!",

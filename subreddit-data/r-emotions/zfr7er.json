            "comment": "Sometimes art and entertainment can lead us on emotional journeys that aren\u2019t necessarily significant to our everyday life. For example, I may be led on a wild car chase and crime story that is very engaging to my body, senses and emotions, but ultimately isn\u2019t relevant to me. So before you dig too deeply, consider it could just be a beautiful and bittersweet story that was well told. If you want to understand why you felt so compelled by it, maybe ask what elements of the story you felt most called by. Write them down in a list first of emotions, then the characters, or the situations. Write what plot twists or developments occurred to you as most compelling. Then take a moment to look at what you\u2019ve written and see if anything is thematic for your life. Maybe it helps you realize a similar feeling or connection to a topic that\u2019s happened to you or is something meaningful for you. Hope that helps!",

            "comment": "Source is important but starting to help her with support is more important. \n\nSource can be genetically passed on depression, or she\u2019s absorbing your worries. \n\n(You cannot not project what you are feeling as kids are emotional sponges. They develop a sense of emotional understanding, esp. with mom, the source of safety, before they can speak or communicate otherwise. Yes it is common and yes it is real for her as a need to heal this in a safe/supported way.)\n\nShe could also be absorbing the heavy worries of school, surroundings, society that absolutely exist without it being her fault for perceiving. Or sth very personal for her that may have happened that she\u2019s not connecting to the longer term effects of feeling unsafe. \n\nYou can talk her through things to help her express and identify but don\u2019t put so much pressure on her to identify as she might actually not know why or where or what she\u2019s feeling in a verbal sense. \n\nJust make it safe for her to witness and to express with your support. Let her know it\u2019s ok to feel emotions even if they\u2019re yucky or feel awkward. Show her it\u2019s ok to be curious about them: what color are they, where in her body does she feel them, if she could draw them what would they look like, if she could use her hands to shape them use the air to shape their shape. Etc. These will all help her identify what she\u2019s feeling without having to know answers. And often in these exercises, the answers come up anyway. \n\nThere was an author who posted months ago here with a book on emotions for kids. That may also help to talk through things as a reminder that they\u2019re safe to experience. \n\nIf you get the sense that her life is impacted by more than just an occurrence of worry, and it\u2019s prolonged, seems to be shaping her character, find kids therapist for depression. Internal family systems might be a great tool for her. Hope that helps.",

            "comment": "Children are often very sensitive to the perceived safety and stability of their home, at a basic level their survival depends on it.   \nThere\u2019s various reasons why your daughter might feel anxious, her father\u2019s absence, your health, etc, and there\u2019s only so much you can do to calm that.   \nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re giving her lots of hugs and encouraging her to play and not worry about you.  \nJohn\u2019s Wort is a natural herbal remedy for anxiety and it\u2019s available in child safe drops and tablets. Have a look online, it may help you too.",

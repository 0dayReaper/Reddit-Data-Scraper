    "postText": "I just found out that my uncle is going to die from parkinson's disease. For some reason I feel frighteningly calm. I know I wasn't that close to him, but I also feel sorrowful. But it's a strange type of sorrow, like the empty kind that doesn't really feel like anything. I am not sure if I'm still processing, I just found out like less than an hour ago. I for some reason always feel this way when something bad happens. When my dad was paralyzed from the waist down I felt the same way. Does anyone understand how I'm feeling? Sometimes I worry that there is something wrong with me based off of this, like I should be crying and mourning, but instead I just feel this empty sadness that doesn't really feel like anything at all.\n\nThis is my first time posting here, so my apologies if something I said irks people in this community. &lt;3",

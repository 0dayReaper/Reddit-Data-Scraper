            "comment": "Hey, I know what you mean. It feels like twenty knives are being jousted right into your heart. We have all been there.\n\nNow, what I am going to tell you is my opinion and may sound impossible or even scary. What I want to say is everyone feels this pain. How is that possible you might be asking? Well, I believe everyone is guided by emotions. For example, babies crawl around with curiosity on the ground until they hit their head or bump their nose, then they just start to cry because they feel like they are about to die. Then their mom or dad will pick them up, and they will feel as though they have been just revived back to life. Then they will calm down and find themselves again. Eventually, they will build up the courage to go out into the world again and explore!\n\nSo if I relate this to what you're experiencing now, you have just bumped your nose on the wall while you were crawling around in the kitchen. You are at the stage where you are looking for your mom or dad or something in this life to pick you back up. Here comes the beautiful part about life, you do not know what that thing is! It could be a song you hear, a person you listen to, an apple you eat, or even this post you are reading now! My point is to have trust in the world that there will always come that light even when you are in the darkest of worlds and seem to have lost all hope.\n\nIn the meantime, a song that has really helped me live the life I live is \"Put Your Records On\" by Corinne Bailey Rae. You got this.",

It's always coming back up, most recently it's been the death of dozens of animals I've seen around my neighborhood mainly cats and squirrels just squashed or died from falling.\n\nI tried to talk about this but I just wanted to know if this normal or not so I don't seem like I think I'm special with this thing but I'm thinking that this is normal and it's not that much of a problem.",

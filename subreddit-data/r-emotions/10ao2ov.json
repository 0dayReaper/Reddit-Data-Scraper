And it ain't just loneliness either that i feel, i feel the bad kind of loneliness, i feel unwanted, like people don't want me, my friends don't want me, well i only have 1 friend which i am close with, but even then i understand she has school and exams and lots going on in her life, i still feel like i have no one to talk to. \n\nIf i can find something to do, distract myself with my hobby it's fine but if i stop and fall into boredom, that's when it kicks in.",

    "postText": "This might sound depressing so I apologise in advance. In the past 2-3 years I\u2019ve had a couple of experiences which in my friends eyes should be seen as traumatic. I will only focus on the \u201ctraumatic\u201d events that has happened this year so far in this lettering. I was raped by two guys (separate occasions) that I was dating and trusted. I was gang raped by 6 guys and at the same time robbed of 200 euros. I was almost kidnapped. \n\nI don\u2019t like to overshare with my friends and is a generally a secretive person. But during these events they have either seen it or dragged it out of me. The reason they did manage to drag it out of me is because I don\u2019t see it as a big deal at all. I don\u2019t really feel anything about it. I know it was wrong and I don\u2019t blame myself for it. I also know that if this would have happened to someone I know I would have felt such an anger towards the ones involved that had done this to my friends/family. But when it comes to me it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t effect me at all in my day to day life and I have never lost even an hour of sleep because of it. Even right after it happened. The people that know about this is upset that I don\u2019t care and because of that I don\u2019t tell them when I get \u201churt\u201d anymore. Most of them think that I push these feelings deep inside of me and they will bubble up eventually, but I know it won\u2019t. All my friend that know have tried to make me visit a therapist. \n\nAnother thing, I don\u2019t learn from my mistakes and seems to put myself in dangerous situations on purpose. I also went back to the two guys that I was dating after the rapes and continued to date for months after, I never brought up to them what they did to me.\n\nI\u2019m more than happy that I don\u2019t feel any negative emotions towards these events but I\u2019m sick of seeing my friends cry for me and me sitting there thinking I\u2019m a bad person for not feeling anything. They know I used to be depressed and suicidal a couple of years back and I know they are extremely worried because of this. I love them with all my heart and will do anything to make them feel better. Is this normal? Should I visit a therapist for them? Even though I don\u2019t think it will help me.\n\nThank you Reddit in advance:)",

            "comment": "Hey there. So, it\u2019s a great question because you should really only go to therapy for yourself. \n\nAt some point you may decide to go and see if there are benefits that your friends might be able to see but you\u2019re not aware of yet. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t discount your feeling of being fine and it\u2019s really great that you have a feeling of safety and clarity after events that intense. The likelihood of not feeling upset by it is highly likely to the shock that your body undertook during the encounters. \n\nThis happens subconsciously so it wouldn\u2019t register to your conscious mind that \u201choly $h!?\u201d my body just turned off. \n\nIf you decide to go to therapy it would help to unlock what your central nervous system locked away and the healing benefits of such therapy would be: a greater sense of peace, clarity, stability and good decision making for your life. \n\nAlthough you may not feel like these are needed, benefits for anyone going into therapy, esp after traumatic events are possible. \n\nIf you don\u2019t find a great therapist to work with tho it can retraumatize you so it\u2019s worth you knowing that .. if you do this for anyone but yourself and get results you don\u2019t like it may be more destabilizing than doing nothing at all. \n\nSo, big decision I guess for a time when you feel like exploring it. \n\nIt\u2019s prob a good idea to do some prelim shopping for therapists and ask them directly the same questions, for the sake of professional advice, to determine if you like their approach and the results promised, and if you think it can enhance your life anyway (trauma or not..) Hope that helps!",

So, if you plan on having kids someday the trauma stuck in your body may be inherited by them. It\u2019s a strange and awful thought but you can read more about generational trauma, it\u2019s a thing. Another reason you may want to undergo some therapy is to perhaps alleviate some of what\u2019s passed down to the next generation. (This goes for everybody.)",

            "comment": "I haven't head extreme cases like yours but I kinda relate to what you're saying on some level. For me it comes from a place of not being in tune with my emotions. \n\nAlso things I say are primarily for my experience and it may or may not be the case for you. \n\n\nI've always felt some deep fear but really a strong reaction to events or people. I'm usually accepting of the outcome. I just let things flow and I am okay with whatever happens. \n\nThe very first time I felt deep emotion was when I went through a bad break up in 2017 and when I was hospitalized in 2020. \n\nOne thing I did notice when I was in the hospital was that I was actually being vulnerable and sharing my sadness/weaknesses with nurses. That was maybe the first time I have connected with people. I was like wow now on I'm going to be open and connect with people. \n\nI went back to being closed off again but the experience helped me see myself through a different lense. \n\nThere was also a funeral of my grandpa in 2021 and I looked around me only to see I was the only one not crying in that tragic event (car accident) not crying but also not a bit of pain in my eyes. Just blank stare (maybe there was 1 or 2 people like me there) I was doing this because I was too busy taking care of the people that were losing their shit and crying on the floor ( I grew up with a mom that had mental outbursts from time to time. A lot of crying and panic attacks. Learned to remain calm and collected) ----- after people stopped crying and calmed down, I found myself tearing up in the corner because I actually was feeling sad (wow I can feel - they work. Great)\n\nNow that I have ignored my feelings, they randomly raise to the surface from time to time. I am generally in a happy state but i find myself feeling close to a black hole at times with a lot of pain and tears. I cant stop or manage them. These emotions randomly show up. \n\nThe hospital thing definitely opened some type of door to my emotions as well as a few people I dated. Some experiences or people have a way of getting deep into you and it can feel painful (as if they are not supposed to be there or it doesn't feel right. It's like digging old trash - like why are you here. You try to close it up and get back to normal again) \n\nI want to try therapy myself but I live in a country that cares about you to a certain degree. They asked for some paperwork and I'm waiting for insurance approval stuff. \n\nI am good at seeing my problems/becoming aware of them but that doesn't fully help me change myself. I also have some unknown fear and I don't know the exact cause. \n\nI am 28 and I had no idea of any of these before the pandemic and the hospital event. So if you're younger, you may not know it yet but if you have any type of suppressed emotions, they will eventually come to the surface at some point.",

What I become obsessed with in my every day life.\" These questions may help you see the gate to your problems.",

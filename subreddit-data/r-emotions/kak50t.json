    "postText": "tw: One mention of suicide\n\nSo, as long as i can remember, I\u00b4ve never really felt things right. For context i was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome- So, as i was saying,  I\u00b4ve never felt things like a normal human being should. Sometimes i get angry at my friend for no reason, even though i like her. And the slightest thing that even slightly comes off as rude, even if it isn\u00b4t, is enough to trigger extreme anger. But normal things that make people upset, Death, losing a pet, whatever the heck makes people cry, they don\u00b4t affect me at all. a had a friend commit suicide and i didn\u00b4t feel sad, angry, or upset at all, i just felt \u00a8Damn bro that was sucky\u00a8 and nothing else.  It\u00b4s like i\u00b4m incapable of feeling basic empathy. Normal emotions make no sense to me, it\u00b4s like everyone around is overreacting. But when i get upset its all \u00a8Can you not rn???\u00a8 and when i leave the chat for a mental health break its \u00a8OMG IM SO SRRY\u00a8 and \u00a8hOw tO nOt cRy iN tHe cAr\u00a8",

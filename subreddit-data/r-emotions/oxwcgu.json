    "postText": "I guess the title makes sense and is a pretty obvious concept, but I just realized that this is happening to me currently.\n\nI'm a pretty emotional and sensitive person, and I used to only cry when I was like feeling sad, upset, nostalgic, sentimental, etc. This was primarily when I was younger; now I'm 23. I notice myself crying or with tears welling up at happy things now. I distinctly remember not being able to understand the idea of \"happy tears\" when I was younger, but now I find myself welling up watching someone's family cheer them on when they win gold at the Olympics or something like that. I don't really cry at sad things anymore, I now just get frustrated or annoyed when I'm overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nHas anyone else observed this?",

How comfortable you are with your happy tears (there are posts here where people are not allowed to feel / express emotions) and how you cope with you negative feelings.\n\nI do advice you to not expect too much. Expectations (you expecting that your values and beliefs and the patterns you have developed are always right) give emotions of anger and frustration. Stoicism digs more into the subject of expectations: [Read about it here](https://www.orionphilosophy.com/academy-stoicism/stoicism-foundation-2-expectation)\n\nWhen I just let thing be or let things happen as they go, I got less frustrated and angry (with others and myself). Something goes wrong,.. let it be, learn from it. Broke something expensive.. shit happens.. The angry emotions doesn't fix it. Got a speeding/parking ticket.. just accept it and pay and don't think about it anymore.\n\nThe less time you spend on thinking about it, the less emotional energy you lose. Use it for happy emotions \ud83d\ude03",

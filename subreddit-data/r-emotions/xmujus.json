    "postText": "So occasionally I'll do something (e.g. dropping and breaking a glass) and my parents will be annoyed at me and will raise their voices slightly. It'll be completely justified - I won't even be upset or angry myself because I understand that and yet, I still get all shaky from this and end up crying.\n\nMy parents rarely shouted when I was younger, so maybe as I'm less used to it this affects me more? But I'm not scared of them or the shouting, it kinda feels like I'm offloading all the adrenaline built up from whatevers just occurred. Is that a thing that can happen? Adrenaline making you cry? I'm so confused \ud83d\ude11",

In my opinion people often cry when they cant express their emotions through speaking, (that\u2019s why children cry more than adults). There is nothing wrong with crying, especially if you have done something more or less \u201cwrong\u201d. \n\nTry to sort out your emotions and put words to them. Staying calm and breathing slow might help.",

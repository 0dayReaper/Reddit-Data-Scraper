In my opinion people often cry when they cant express their emotions through speaking, (that\u2019s why children cry more than adults). There is nothing wrong with crying, especially if you have done something more or less \u201cwrong\u201d. \n\nTry to sort out your emotions and put words to them. Staying calm and breathing slow might help.",

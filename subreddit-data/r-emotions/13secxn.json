Or what do you need to feel to know you have those feeling? \nThere is someone I'm very good friends with and I may be developing some sort of feelings for them but I don't know what they are exactly(?)\nIdk if this question made sense but hopefully I can get some feedback.  Thank you for your time lol.",

For context I'm poly and do have multiple partners.\n\nHowever a lot of the time just talking with the person about how you feel can help a lot. I also try to be clear with them about what I expect of them and what they can expect of me.",

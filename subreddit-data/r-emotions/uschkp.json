            "comment": "I\u2019d love it to be bigger. I healed some pretty significant childhood trauma a few years ago and all my emotions felt different (like they were now cake when all I was used to before were individual ingredients) and I couldn\u2019t recognize them because they were essentially all new sensations that I\u2019ve never experienced before. It\u2019s like I would imagine a deaf person experiencing auditory stimuli for the first time and having to associate the new experiences with things they\u2019ve interacted with their whole lives. Except I don\u2019t have the physical world to corroborate or verify that what I\u2019m experiencing is actually \u201cconfidence\u201d (for example) because I had felt what I *thought* everyone meant by \u201cconfidence\u201d before, but I can recognize now that it wasn\u2019t even close\u2026 Like before it was just an unmixed set of ingredients for an omelette, but turned out to actually be zucchini bread. \n\nBut\u2026 is that zucchini bread really the final product? Is what other people consider \u201cconfidence\u201d actually zucchini bread pudding (I don\u2019t know how baking works) and I still don\u2019t know I have a ways to go? Is it just the crumble on top of some elaborate dessert? Is this zucchini bread I\u2019m experiencing even \u201cconfidence\u201d because you can\u2019t actually taste the eggs I started with that were used to make it so\u2026 \n\nAnyway, this is a long way of me saying I\u2019d love for this subreddit to be bigger as well lol.",

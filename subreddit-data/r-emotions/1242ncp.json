    "postText": "I dont feel like I enjoy talking to people, when the time comes i wouldn't know what to say not on a shy way but because i don't feel pleasured on having an conversation, when girls ask me out i don't feel like \"wow i really want a girlfriend and kisses\" but i rather think \"what would be the profit\" and i end up rejecting because i dont feel like its worth it. Its kinda weird but i think I've been corrupted while trying to be the best, i feel like such things as happiness coming from other humans is meaningless and not worth it. But I still feel sad and kinda regret beeing like this, I'd rather have good relationships in exchange of my best grades and good physique, but i dont really feel like doing it on my will. Is this bad?",

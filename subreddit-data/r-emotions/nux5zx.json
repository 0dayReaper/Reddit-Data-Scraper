    "postText": "So I was sucker punch by a person I am aquainted with like a year ago at an event I threw. He said to me, \"I'm not afraid of you\" and I laughed because it was uncalled for and weirded out especially at the event I threw. So buddy who can't handle his drink punched my ribs, hard enough to antagonize and provoke me but light enough that there was no lasting damage or bruise. I wanted to to go in but some girl ran over to and protected him.  \n\n\nWhy do I still think about this from time to time? Am I angry that the opportunity to retailiate was lost (I moved)?\n\nThoughts and comments.",

If humans formed groups there is a better chance of survival.\n\nThis person broke the rule of how he should treat another person. We expect that others follow these rules and when expectations are not met, we feel irritated, angry.\n\nJust like you expect people to follow the rules on the road. If sombody cuts you off, you will feel angry too.\n\nNow you know where the emotion comes from, let it go. You can't change the past. You're only hurting yourself now, the guy has probably forgotten about the incident.\n\nHe's not worth your energy that you give him by continuous reminding yourself about the incident.\n\nLook into stoicism, it might give you some wisdom how to think in a certain way so you're not bothered by emotions.",

The posturing and half assed punch sounds like an attempt to scare you off without provoking a full on retaliation. Stop being so hench and intimidatingly manly!",

    "postText": "So all my life, once in a while I will get this sudden, overwhelming burst of emotion that seems to come out of nowhere. I feel it in my chest and in my forearms, it's almost like a humming or a glowing, not painful or tight, and the closest thing I can think of related to emotions is like.. I need a hug.. in a good way? But it's not necessarily a feeling of loneliness or sadness. Can't put my finger on it. Getting a hug from a loved one helps but doesn't resolve the feeling. Never lasts long though and goes away on its own after a few minutes. But have never been able to determine why it happens or what the feeling is. Can anyone relate, or anyone know what it is? Not depression. Not sadness. Not anger, frustration, loneliness, fear, excitement, embarrassment, anticipation, joy, happiness. Most of the time happens around other people. I've been told that maybe I'm just picking up on other people's emotions and unable to decode it internally but I welcome any feedback. Thanks",

The humming you're feeling is your energy body (some people even hear it). For most of us, since we haven't been taught to pay attention to our energy body, it's too subtle for us to feel. But when it's flooded with energy, it feels like a humming and if it gets supper charged it glows. If you practice, and since you already know the feeling of your energy body, you should eventually be able to feel it without having to flood it.\n\nIf it is your energy body opening up, eventually it will completely open and in that case you'll become uber sensitive to energy and emotions. And most likely than not, for a period of time, you'll also become more emotional. This is normal and just part of the process. Once you adjust to your new energy state, you'll balance out.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents :)\n\n[Paths In the Void](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClAZAT4IOAA1F6xJG3NGmwA)",

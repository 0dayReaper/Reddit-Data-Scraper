    "postText": "I'm looking to gain insight &amp; perspectives on healthy ways to view/understand emotions, as well as to manage them.\n\nThe main emotions in question are stress/overwhelm, anxiety/fear, shame, guilt, discouragement, anger/frustration, and discouragement. \n\nI like Dr. Andrew Huberman's call for a healthy dissociation from your emotions, like stress, and to consider them from a physiological/neuroscience POV. I'm more familiar with thinking about them from a psychological/counseling, philosophical, &amp; theological POV, so considering emotions as a physiological sensation was a new and helpful approach for me, \n\nAre there are books/resources that further elaborate on ways to approach emotions (concept-wise and technique-wise)? Whether it be from a physiological approach or another one. \n\nIt can be specific or general\u2014books providing a framework/philosophy of emotions, or books on specific emotions/specific techniques.\n\nThanks!",

However, on more than one occasion, when I've brought this book up to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or a friend in that field, I've seen them make a face. Didn't really feel like getting into it at the time, but any idea what the general pushback on this book might be?",

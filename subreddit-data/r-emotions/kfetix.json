    "postText": "Today I came to the discouraging realization that I get angry A LOT easier than I\u2019d like to admit. I never noticed how bad it really was, and wouldn\u2019t really consider myself to have a short fuse. But now it\u2019s starting to hurt my relationships with people, especially my boyfriend. This is not a good look on me and I really want to be mellow, and feel peace, not just fly off the handle. I believe this anger to be the root to a majority of emotions I experience. Not sure if anger is THE root, or an extending limb from a deeper issue. But one of my theories is, I has a little something to do with the way I was raised. My dad, and ALL my siblings also have a really short temper and are more apt to explode on a regular basis. Looking back I remember resenting my parents each time I was disciplined. So we\u2019re talking my whole life I was raised in that environment. I want to break this lifelong pattern of hurt, anger, and frustration over the petty things I don\u2019t need to react to. Any advice?",

Highly recommend you find a therapist but you can just buy a workbook like [this one](https://www.newharbinger.com/overcoming-situational-and-general-anger-client-manual), which will lead you through exercises to retrain your brain. It really works for anger issues, which are totally treatable. Good luck!",

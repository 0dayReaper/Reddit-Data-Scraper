            "comment": "Emotions have a purpose that we can't always control.\n\nThey are useful, but not always helpful to how we want to live our lives.\n\nAnger warms our blood and helps us break flight or fight response. It also gives us a sense of justice if we are wronged. It could be the case that your body is just producing more catecholamines for adulthood, which is making you experience more emotions like anger.\n\nSadness gives us a sense of detachment, so our bodies can slow down and rewire our brains to accept loss. It makes us feel lethargic for energy saving purposes. It might be the case you are feeling sad because puberty is the loss of childhood and you body needs a lot of energy to undergo such a transformation.\n\nThere also might be a lot of other things going on in your life. You can feel up to 5 emotions at once and there are plenty of other common emotions, like frustration, being overwhelmed, and disappointment, that usually are misidentified as some other emotion.\n\nMy advice is to check out a book called Emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman. And also just know that puberty is a time in your life where a lot of changes are going on, and it's okay not to know everything that is going on. Just try and express gratitude for whatever changes you experience and forgiveness for the things you felt went badly. That would have saved me so much grief when I was younger. If you have any more questions I'm willing to help out, good luck!",

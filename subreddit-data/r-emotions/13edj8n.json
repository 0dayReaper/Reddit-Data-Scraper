But it also takes time to unwind. You can make some pretty awesome progress in a short time but it really depends how much your system can handle in removing the blocks. Slow and steady is the way. Some people rush into hallucinagenic drugs to try to treat this quickly but it can end up doing more damage. Best approach is to find a trauma trained therapist. With the support of an individual who know what they\u2019re doing you can move past things that are too much for your own system to handle alone.",

And i think remembering what my childhood was like could be a good place to start",

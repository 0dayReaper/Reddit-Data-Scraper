I heard a probably 5 second or so clip from the song For the First Time by Mac Demarco, it made me feel a weird emotion. I have no memories attached to this song this was the first time i've heard it. It nearly made me cry, I got chills and my eyes started to water. I'm not a very emotional person, I don't cry very often which is why I'm so curious about why I almost started bawling from a song I have no memory of. I kinda froze when I heard it, it was like everything around me wasn't there for those few seconds I listened, it's an odd feeling. I don't really know if I came hear to rant or to find answers. Any replies of any kind would be appreciated.",

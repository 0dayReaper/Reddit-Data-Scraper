    "postText": "My life is completely empty. The only thing that matters to me is my dog \u200b\u200band an impossible dream to fulfill. I enjoy watching wrestling, reading manga, watching a series or movie, or playing video games, but nothing else.\n\nThere is nothing that I like that I can dedicate myself to, and if there is, I am terrible at it. computer science studies I joined for no reason just makes me feel stupid. I am very afraid of the future, but at the same time, nothing matters to me. I don't want to live in this neighborhood, but wherever I go I only see grey, dull and dark. I would like to go to Swedish Lapland and see the Northern Lights, but I know I will never be able to do it on my own.\n\nI don't love anyone, the day my dog \u200b\u200bdies, my humanity will go with him. I don't love my family, I don't love the people I know, nobody matters to me.\n\nJust like I don't love anyone, nobody loves me. No one has shown interest in me. Maybe if I die someone will cry and be sad for a couple of days, but I won't leave an impact on anyone. I would like to live in a fantasy world where everyone has a friend, lover or brother they love, I want to have someone to give my life for.\n\nI have considered running away, I would like to go somewhere where I can see the sea, but nothing will change if I leave, I will only become a stinking vagabond, and no one would care for me. Nobody is going to fall in love with me, I am not handsome and I have zero social skills. Still, maybe one day I will, the only thing holding me back is my mother. She doesn't realize how much she's making my life miserable, she doesn't see that I'm not a child and she treats me like one. I don't care starving on the side of the road, I want to do something, anything.\n\nI have no aspirations. I can't even kill myself because I don't want to get hurt, what if I throw myself off a building and survive the fall? What if I hang myself and my neck doesn't break instantly? I don't want to feel physical pain.\n\nI have ideas that if I say in public, they would laugh at me, it has already happened, in fact. Sometimes I think that having a serious conversation with someone is something that only happens in movies. For example, I once told a couple of classmates my thoughts about monogamy. I think that not having relationships with other people even if you want to is making a sacrifice without getting anything in return. It seems very selfish to me not to let your partner be with whoever she wants to be with, for me she is not disrespecting me or being disloyal for it. My classmates laughed at me for that idea, they don't have to agree with me, but there was no need to ridicule me for it either.\n\nI have never been bullied (School), I may be ugly but at least I have always been big for my age. Although my older brother has hit, yelled at, spat at and ridiculed me on various occasions since I was little. Once when I was a kid, my parents weren't home and he brought a friend over. My brother and his friend took off my pants and ridiculed me for the size of my penis (Obviously, asshole. I'm a child). I ran to my room and hid under my bed, but they dragged me out and ridiculed me again for not defending myself.\n\nHe also threw me to the ground on another occasion and kicked me so that I would give him some savings that I had hidden. And he kicked my dog \u200b\u200bjust for walking into his room. Luckily he left home about a year ago, I hate him with all my being.\n\nThat would be all, there are a couple of things that I would like to comment on or emphasize, but they are not that relevant. I'm sharing this in case anyone has valuable advice that can help me, thanks.\n\n(Also, I'm from Seville, Spain. English is not my native language and i apologize if there is any misspelling)",

Change is a certainty.  \nI don\u2019t know how old you are but when you\u2019re 18 you can join Workaway and travel in Spain and other countries to help people with projects of all sorts.  Animal care, gardening, building work etc.    \nFor a few hours of work each day you get food and a bed and meet new friends. \nAll you need is the willingness to help and learn and be unselfish.     \nThe more places you go the more skills you will learn and the more friends you can make.       \nAnd you can take your dog with you.\n\nRight now you have a dog, that is the best friend you could have. I hope you walk your dog every day, not only for the dog\u2019s exercise but for yours too.   \nMake sure to get enough sleep each night and spend as much time as you can walking.   \nLife seems grey and hopeless now but there\u2019s a whole world out there, and lots of friendly, kind people to meet.",

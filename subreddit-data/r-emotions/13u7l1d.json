Change is a certainty.  \nI don\u2019t know how old you are but when you\u2019re 18 you can join Workaway and travel in Spain and other countries to help people with projects of all sorts.  Animal care, gardening, building work etc.    \nFor a few hours of work each day you get food and a bed and meet new friends. \nAll you need is the willingness to help and learn and be unselfish.     \nThe more places you go the more skills you will learn and the more friends you can make.       \nAnd you can take your dog with you.\n\nRight now you have a dog, that is the best friend you could have. I hope you walk your dog every day, not only for the dog\u2019s exercise but for yours too.   \nMake sure to get enough sleep each night and spend as much time as you can walking.   \nLife seems grey and hopeless now but there\u2019s a whole world out there, and lots of friendly, kind people to meet.",

There's no way to not feel things and still be alive. The only way to improve things is to get better at feelings - if you let them flow through you they won't build up. Letting feelings out makes them less intense. Another way to make them less intense is to name them. It won't work with every one, but often spending some time feeling the feeling will tell you what it is. This site can help find words for feelings: [https://feelu.now.sh/](https://feelu.now.sh/)",

Presumably you\u2019re feeling unhappy and want that to stop, but you\u2019re going to have to be more specific if you want practical help.",

I guess I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m not in constant physical pain and I\u2019ve been able to ride out past times of depression and grief and come out the other side. You\u2019ve got to appreciate the simple pleasures and remember that nothing is inherently good or bad, except for how we feel about it. And our feelings are not always helping us. A few years ago I went for over a year feeling desperately unhappy and filled with grief (interspersed with moments of simple joy, sitting in warm sunshine or a kind word from a friend) until I woke up one day, felt the same old feelings begin to crush my chest and I stopped and thought \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m so  tired of feeling this way. It\u2019s just...sooo boring!\u201d And I realised that my feelings were the only thing hurting me at that time and I could decide to not feel that way. It was a habit I\u2019d been holding onto and outgrown. I\u2019m not saying my life was all roses and stardust after that, my circumstances were still the same, but I certainly enjoyed my life much more and was more able to appreciate what I had. As for Buddhists, I\u2019ve known a few and they\u2019re usually quite cheerful. I can say that the experience of \u2018oneness with everything\u2019 is completely blissful as you let go of your sense of human individuality and separateness, but it is not possible to live in that state day to day. Human experience is individual, which is the source of most of our unhappiness. Negation of ego is really about reducing the sense of individuality, the less separated you feel, the happier you become.",

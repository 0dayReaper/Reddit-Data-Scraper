            "comment": "Mindfulness as a tool for awareness is invaluable. Becoming aware of our emotions is a beautiful way to create safety in our individual systems and a more objective perspective in getting to know ourselves rather than being so caught up in our experiences that we do not have the presence and capacity to navigate the experience. \n\nHowever, be sure to understand, mindfulness as a tool to interrupt emotions is not a solution for emotional processing and the inner voice is not the source of inner conflict / suffering. \n\nThe central nervous system is designed with limits to handle experiences as best as it can. And that which is beyond our capacity to handle (trauma) becomes stuck, looping, seeking emotional resolution. \n\nThere is no rational resolution, no control resolution and no mindfulness resolution without processing the fullness of feeling of what has been stored in the body\u2019s system.\n\nEmotions are there to be felt, not controlled or rationalized. \n\nThe mindfulness aspect is a newer component in the human system which provides us many benefits. But healing loops, the inner voice and emotions in general can not be completed with mindfulness only. \n\nThat said, there are layers of surface experiences that will arise during meditation and resolve themselves bc the body is in a state of safety, calm and capacity. For everything else that\u2019s looping, working directly with the emotions is the channel for true healing.",

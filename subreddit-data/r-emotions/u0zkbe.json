Humans are complicated, unreliable and can be hard to trust, especially if you\u2019ve been beaten down physically and emotionally when young.   \nHelp at a dog shelter, walk a neighbours dog, learn to accept the affection of a dog. Or a cat, that can work too, but dogs are more obviously affectionate.",

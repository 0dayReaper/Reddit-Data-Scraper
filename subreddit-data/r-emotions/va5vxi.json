Good Habits change our life, shit like meditation, exercise, gratitude, deep work etc. But when we are feeling so unmotivated it is hard to do these things. \n\nThe trick is to start super small and then increase them when you feel able to do so. \n\nE.g. Day 1 - 3 minute of meditation, 10 push ups, wrote one thing i was grateful for\n\nDay 2 - 4 min meditation, 10 push ups 10 squats, wrote two things.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe good habits is what changes our drive and motivation, but we need to start small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope I helped!!",

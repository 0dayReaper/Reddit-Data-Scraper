    "postText": "You feel emotion all the time.  \nIt is impossible to not feel nothing.  \nIf you DO feel nothing - that's what Buddhists call the Void or Enlightenment.\n\nBut the rest of us feel some emotion all the time.  \nIf you look at the list, you can surely pick something that is going right now or any given moment during the last 240 hours (yes, even during sleep).\n\nShame  \nGuilt  \nApathy  \nSadness  \nFear  \nDesire  \nAnger  \nPride  \nCourage  \nAcceptance  \nJoy  \nLove  \nPeace\n\nThe problem is that some people, when they are in those really low states - like shame, guild and apathy - feel those emotions so intensely, that they forget that those emotions are JUST THE EMOTIONS.\n\n**They stop being those who feel the emotions, and become the emotions.**\n\nAnd that's a recipe for a disaster.  \nWhen this happens, the emotions gets magnified - as when you are filming the camera screen. The signal gets doubled, quadrupled, etc.  \nThey feel shame about feeling shame.  \nGuilt about being guilty.  \nAnd apathy about feeling apathetic.\n\nThe important thing to remember at that point is:   \n**You are not your emotions,** you only FEEL your emotions.  \n**You are not your thoughts,** your emotions merely generate those thoughts.  \n**You are not your body,** you only HAVE the body. If you got your arm cut, there wouldn't be less of you.\n\nWhen you are able to grasp these 3 concepts, you can easily understand that the only **real you** you can identify yourself with is **the observer.** \n\nWhen you are the observer, you can observe the emotions and the thoughts.\n\nAnd when you feel apathy, shame or guilt, you can simply **observe them** and not **be them**.  \nIt's difficult because when you feel any of those, the last thing that comes to your mind is thinking about this post, but once you get better at it, it is crazy how fast you can let the emotions go.\n\nApathy is one of the hardest, so I wrote an entire post about it.\n\nYou can read it [here](https://medium.com/@bymaros/you-cant-be-fixed-because-you-re-not-broken-the-psychology-of-brokenness-626ea031c07b).",

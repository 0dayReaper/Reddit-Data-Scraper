            "comment": "In rhetoric, emotions (pathos) are the intelligence we use to navigate our ideations (logos) and rules (ethos) personal or societal. The emotion doesn't contradict it, redefinition doesn't change it, pleas can't convince everyone all the time. There is a thing called the hedonistic treadmill, where we make adaptions only to return to comfort, the commodities are the value, even if the commodity is power over pleasures. Showing people and changing their culture by demonstrating thru actions and having passion for the emotions or actions society needs, will lead people to buy into it, to buy commoditized emotions of a natural liberation from unrealistic attachment, and improper attachments. Emotions are physically and mentally designed to protect or encourage success, think of capitalism as a stepping stone, whereas without it cavemen develop values too long before we can teach them programs and systems.",

Capitalism attempts to destroy life and it's most fundamental means of communication. It claims it can trap emotions in a frame, a box or a package and comodify it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus capitalism itself goes against life and it destroys life by design. \n\nEmotions are the most obvious secret of embodied life. Humans don't understand them and have no clue what they're for.",

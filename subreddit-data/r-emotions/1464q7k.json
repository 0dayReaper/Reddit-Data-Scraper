    "postText": "Taking care of a 12 year old is hard. She\u2019s clingy but refuse to show it, pretend to be a know it all, has anger issues, need to be better than everyone; or else the world falls apart. \n\nShe treats everyone with no regard of their feelings. She doesn\u2019t care enough to keep people around. Because she don\u2019t need that. She\u2019s fine on her own. She can do anything. No one is worth her time to build relationships with. People leave anyways. \n\nTaking care of a 12 year old in a 24 year old body is hard. She thinks she\u2019s maturing, intellectualizing her emotions as she goes. Because it\u2019s okay it\u2019s fine this is how things are and she has to accept it. More like a compensation for how she was. \n\nSometimes she can feel the 12 year old girl piercing through, clawing, begging for someone to stay in her life. Something she couldn\u2019t have done when she was 12. So desperately in need of a genuine connection. So very desperate wanting to be at peace with herself. \n\nNow she\u2019s 24, wishing she could have told the 12 year old girl that it\u2019s okay to make mistakes, it\u2019s okay to be vulnerable no one is out to get you, it\u2019s okay to show your true emotions, it\u2019s okay to hurt. But she can\u2019t. \n\nShe\u2019s hurting and feeling pieces of herself float away every night as she tried to embrace the consequences of her actions. Thinking she deserves this. She doesn\u2019t know who she is anymore. Deep down, she\u2019s still that 12 year old girl who don\u2019t know how to heal, stuck in a trance. \n\nBeing a 24 year old with the ghost of her 12 year old self is hard.",

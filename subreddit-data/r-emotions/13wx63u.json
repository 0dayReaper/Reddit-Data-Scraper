While it\u2019s not medical advice I can say it can be quite common to laugh in what might seem like inappropriate situations. The reason being, your trauma is seeking a way to discharge. For some people it is deeply suppressed naturally to a place that\u2019s not capable of expression. So it can be a good sign that your body laughs bc it shows that on some level there is energy to express what it is trying to discharge. If you have the possibility, working with a Somatic Experiencing therapist or other trauma trained therapist can help release what your body is trying to and to reset your system.",

I try to make myself realise that past cannot be changed and I cannot cry over it for the rest of my life so better face it with a smile. It gives me the strength to face it .",

    "postText": "We were both lost in the world but at least we were lost together. That's how it felt. She was not emotionally ready to commit to a relationship. I really pray for her happiness but it was reaching a point where I was putting her needs ahead of my own and had to end it. She understood. It's been very difficult since we broke up 3 days ago. I poured everything out into a song to express myself sonically instead of through words. \n\nI just needed to vent to be honest. Ill link the song but this isn't a promo by any standard.\n\n[https://youtu.be/F7OUNWbs\\_TU](https://youtu.be/F7OUNWbs_TU)",

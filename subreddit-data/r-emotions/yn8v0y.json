    "postText": "So ive been friends with this girl for a while, but im confused as to how i feel about her. Shes been one of the best friends ive ever had, and i feel quite strongly for her but in a wierd way. Its almost likw having a crush on her, but the thing is, even in a world where i could have everything, i wouldnt want to be in a relationship with her. I dont want to kiss her nor do anything like that with her but i show all the other signs of affection.\nI get nervous when im about to meet her, i feel bummed when something doesnt work out, etc, etc.\n\nIve been vwry confused about this and am now asking, has anyone else felt this? If so, what is it? Is it love or something else?",

            "comment": "Sounds like platonic love, yeah. Or like an biromantic asexual crush (or any variation of being interested in emotional closeness but not any sexual/physical aspects. Could be that you\u2019re just not attracted to her gender yet bonded anyway). Feels pretty much like that.",

                            "comment": "Argh that\u2019s a hard question. It depends on how they perceive it and how they feel about receiving the affection. I have a (probably) asexual friend who seems to feel that way towards me and frankly\u2026 I feel really bad for only being on the receiving end of it xd Kinda guilty for not putting in the same amount of effort. Affirmations that \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d and she\u2019s happy with just being able to shower me with love don\u2019t help much. I\u2019ve just been lonely for most of my childhood, which taught me to really appreciate anyone who likes me and it\u2019s just hard to change it at this point.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum I also felt that sort of platonic love towards a male friend and it really didn\u2019t seem to affect him much. I mean, he was just fine with chilling like we normally did, with no commitment nor expectations. And I didn\u2019t want anything to change (would feel seriously uncomfortable with it), so it was cool with me as well. I\u2019m guessing the main difference here is that he never struggled with loneliness- receiving affection felt normal to him.\n\nIt\u2019s really on you to feel this out. Maybe talk about relationship experiences first\u2026. If they have a habit of one-sidedly investing into their lover, one-sidedly receiving affection from someone else might be hard for them. If not- then probably not.\nThere might also be other things to note I just don\u2019t know about. Just writing from my experiences.\nThere really are no easy answers here",

When we do pleasant activities together (for which we aren't paid for) we create love.\n\nYou need this person to feel happy and the attractions is no more than wanting to be with that person to feel happy and loved. And this person can be anyone and there are a lot of people you need just a bit of, so you'll have attraction to a lot of people because they can fulfill your needs.\n\nI'm in a dance group and I love to dance with different people, some I'm more attracted to because of the way they dance, the way they dance resonates more with me.\n\nWe think we can only love that one special person in our life, but we can love and get love from so many other people. We are often ashamed because we \"think\" there can be only one.\n\nFeeling loved by someone and having a sexual attraction to someone is totally different. Love comes in many forms and is about understanding someone and knowing what they need at a certain moment to feel better and more happy.\n\nI miss the Love and Peace movement... we should love others more to create peace of mind and a healthy well-being for everybody.",

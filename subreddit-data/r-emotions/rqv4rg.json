    "postText": "Up until recently my life had been going really well. I never was in a particularly bad place emotionally (still don't think I am, really) but it all changed. Recently, I haven't been able to process emotions. Doing stuff I like now doesn't give me happiness. Whenever I do something that would usually reward me with happiness now, I just kind of can't process the emotion? It's like I wait for it to come but it never does. Same goes for sadness and stress to some extent. Anger strangely enough doesn't change that much, I can still get angry at a pretty normal level. I haven't been having any bad habits apart from one, and it is having stress. These past few years I have just been piling up with stress, family members and friends often tell me to not always be stressed but I genuinely couldn't help it. Now I can't process stress well and can't really feel it all that much. Anyone know why this is happening and if it links with my past stress? (Sorry if my English is bad, it's not my first language)\nedit: I would like to add that I haven't had any emotional trauma. I live in a loving family that is in a good state economically.\nedit 2: yes, this applies to contextual emotions, too",

It's like I wait for it to come but it never does.\" **Could you recall a day where it was vivid that you cannot feel that way? How the week before it exactly was going? Are there any elements in your surroundings that could be affecting your subconscious? Are you afraid to be happy? hmm, I know these are a lot of questions to go through, but answering these questions to yourself might give you an insight.**\n\n\"Same goes for sadness and stress to some extent.\" **maybe your brain and body pausing you somehow from feeling for some reason.**\n\n\"Anger strangely enough doesn't change that much, I can still get angry at a pretty normal level. \" **Could it be that this is the feeling that your body and brain needs to release and compromise suppressing? Or is it the one that wasn't subject to the pausing phase, hmm.**\n\n\"These past few years I have just been piling up with stress, family members and friends often tell me to not always be stressed but I genuinely couldn't help it. Now I can't process stress well and can't really feel it all that much.\" **This make sense now, your body is overwhelmed and it reacts now in the complete opposite which is not healthy as well. You need to reach a balance in your life. Stress and anxiety are normal to feel and they work as our alarm system, having them in the moderate amount and in the right place is healthy, you need to integrated new activities in your life where you release out your stress and anxiety, like writing, sport, maybe planting or cooking (inventions sometimes and at others following a recipe), art or whatever healthy useful practice where you feel you gain control over your life and use anxiety to regulate your life instead of hindering it, and to release the extra anxiety and stress out of your body!**  \n\" (Sorry if my English is bad, it's not my first language) \" **Your English is really good and clear. Maybe this says that you need to be less judgmental upon yourself and more realistic.**\n\n***How do you find my answer? I hope it could've help you or at least have offered you some inspiration!***",

I found things I love, occupied myself with school and surrounded myself with people that I love and I am 99.9% certain they love me back as well! I don't know why, but I feel as though your comment played a part in how I changed my life for the better! Thank you for everything",

    "postText": "It's been 1 year today since all this happened and people who weren't there first hand don't believe it happened. And the topic at hand is so \"Hot topic\" too people just immediate lable me as transphobic even know I keep saying \"it's just this one person\" however I addmitly can't help but feel negative towards trans people because of it even know my religion, Buddishem, says to treath everyone the same. I guess this is a vent post but honestly I just really want someone to believe me at this point. I feel like I can't talk about this at all without being attacked even know I very clearly am the victim in all this even know the attack wants to play that card. \n\nIt all started when I started a job at a Bakery. It was when the COVID bread making crave hit. I joined on it too because it looked fun but then I realized how much money it cost. I was still on unemployment but I knew it would run out sooner or later and i had 2 more payments already coming in so I decided to apply for a job at a Bakery that makes Artisan bread. They where desperately needed help because no one wanted to work for 13$ a hour and wake up at 2am everyday. So I got the job. And something the boss asked me in the interview was \"how do you feel about transgenders\". My response was, isn't it pretty normal at this point. The way I personally see it is, you do you bro . However I also believe it is not my place to tell or judge people off of my beliefs because no one knows for sure what's really going on. I did not say that to him I only said \"I'm okay working with them, it's pretty normal now isn't it?\" \n\nFirst few days it was awesome. The person who was trans was on vacation, but I didn't know that. I just assumed one of the girls there was trans. And to be honest I was thinking, \"wow I don't know who is trans but everyone is really pretty\" not that I was trying to flirt with a co-worker because that always go wrong. It was just a thought. Then the trans person came back from vacation and the very first thing out of that person's mouth was \"God I hate straight men\" (remember this it will be a theme). \n\nI was new, so I brushed it off thinking, \"hmm must be a inside joke because everyone here seems really close\" and let it be. However that whole day the trans person just kept going on. Rant after rant about hating straight men, hating certain groups and people I didn't even heard of, and just talking about hateful things over and over. Everyone was laughing at/with them. Tbh idk why they laughed to this day but they just kept laughing. Maybe to get thought that person's bullshit. I got thought the day and at the end of it, just to laugh I said to myself in my mind not any actual person. \"Welp I know who the trans person is now\". \n\nI took that as, \"someone must have hurt there feelings maybe they just broke up with someone or something\" and let that day go. However as the weeks went by I realized, no that's just the personality they have. (I'm going to mention now that at the time they where 18) I should also mention everyones sexuality because that also plays a roll of what happened. \n\nPretty much everyone besides me, another white male, and the main boss where either gay or A sexual. Act\u00faa there was only 1 aces. So everyone else was gay. Again, i don't care. I don't think it's wrong to be wrong. And if I did think it was wrong it's not my place to judge anyone so I would never say anything or act a different way. I bring this up because the one straight female who worked there the longest quit so they had to hire someone else quicky. They still been looking for more help but they weren't looking as badly. The main boss wanted everyone in the work place to be friends and at first though that sounds wonderful until you realize, the only people who have friends that work at 2am job to 11am job are high schoolers or people who JUST got out of High schoolers. So what ended up happening is he hired the trans persons friends, who where also gay/trans. I had no issue with them however. The whole time the only person I worked with that I had a issue with was still the original person. That is because everyday they came into they would literally scream,to the point front of house would have to ask to be quite and customers would complain, about straight people. And with the introduction of there friends now there it only got worse. They kept playing WOP on repeat after I told them I don't really like talking about sexual stuff at work (who would we work with food!) They would talk about dildos for hours, the trans person I had a problem with would talk about wanting a cyber pussy (like seriously this is shit you would only see in Key and Peele skits) and then they started attack religions and at that point I had enough. \n\nI keep saying no one has a right to judge other people based on there beliefs! No one! So I told them STILL Nicely,  \"look let's stop talking about religion\" and they actually did for once. The next day they start talking about how Buddishem is sexist because they Chinese version believes \"if your a women you will be reincarnated as a man\" this went on for months. But I came to learn how to make bread and i was doing it! And i was good at it too. After months of working with just straight dough I finally got promoted to mixer so I could start making the dough by hand and feeling how it shaped. But the week before the trans person and immediate high school friend told everyone \"don't accept a promotion until things get better here we deserve respect\" but they have been the most disrespectful person to not only me but ever other department in the bakery. So much so the bread department had a reputation of being assholes. And understandably so too. \n\nAfter I took the mixing job (with no extra pay by the way) that's when shit got out of hand. Everyday they just kept talking badly being very passive agress towards me till one day I broke down and started crying and just went home. And the managers KNEW what was going on and there's been many conversations about firing them but it was never done. Why? Because the manager had a soft spot for people with mental illnesses. He would tell us about how at his last job they would take advantage of someone with mental illnesses and he didn't want to be like that. Understandable. However the trans person used this by claiming to have MANY MANY mental illness but didn't. Around the time I ended working there they claimed they developed a Illness (i can't spell it but it starts with a T) that makes them say random sexual things. \"my virgin hurts\" \"uhwe pussy\" and they didn't do anything about this too. I don't know if it was because they can't claim someone is lying about mental illnesses or they actually believe it but come on that's crossing a line. Actually the line has been crossed long ago that was just the cherry on top. And there's still more cherries coming! \n\nAfter I got the mixing job and started a specking out more about all this they all went to the main boss and started saying \"I'm making them feel uncomfortable or I'm sexist\" just bullshit crap. And when they confronted me about it I said \"okay let's talk one on one with them\" and none of them did! It was at that point where I had enough and told them I'm I'll finish the day today but I'm not coming in tomorrow and the assistant manager even agreed that I've been targeted by immaturity. But at the end of the day her and the main boss allowed it to happen as well. I don't know what happened after that but damn that whole thing was fucked up. And for some reason the \"friends\" i did make there just stopped talking to me. I don't know if they felt embressed or just got busy but they just didn't want to talk to me after I quit. \n\n(I want to add this because I forgot but when I was talking to the two bosses they said \"you need to remember they are 18\" but at that age you know better than to act like a total asshole) \n\nAfter the instead happened I tried to talk to people about it, but people just don't believe me! It's something about hearing the words \"transgender\" that if you don't say something positive your transphobic. I felt like no body was listening to me really! They just kept saying \"yeah that never happened\". It got to the point where I was thinking I need to go into debt to get a therapist. Luckily I didn't have too because I was getting better but ever now and then I can't help but think about it. \n\nHonestly though the most hurtful part about all this is just people don't believe... The victim of sexism is somehow the bad guy... \n\nI had to get a job on a fishing boat on Alaska to get away from the people in my hometown because everyone turned on me for saying something bad about transgenders even know everyone knew me for years. One little thing set them off. God damn. Luckily at the time I was dating someone who had my back and was helping me though it. I kept asking her \"am I doing something wrong\" and even she was saying \"no that person is just a really bad guy\" but when everyone just turns on you, and no one believes you that hurts. I cut them all out of my life but right now I'm back visiting family (a hour drive from my hometown and where my grandparents live) I went to see them but as I looked around that town I just felt disgusted by the people. I hate my hometown now. I still can't believe after everything I've done for both the people and town people believe them over me because they are trans and I'm straight. Im black and never felt like I've been racially judged but I definitely been judge for my sexual identity, which even they say isn't a choice. \n\nMore than anything though I still can't believe no one believed me. I think that's what fucked me up the most...",

I just put a extremely emotional and tragic even that happened to me that was so emotional damaging to me I can't even go though home town and felt like I had to leave over it and the first and only thing anyone has said is \"your transphobic\" not just you but everyone who is in the trans community. Not a single person took the time to agree that what this person had done is fucked up on so many levels. Just attack me. And I know your going to try to find a way to flip this on me but in reality I don't find all trans ppl this toxic. I only remember it when I encounter a trans person. The ones that don't claim to be part of the trans community are the best ones because they don't jump to attack someone from what I found however you seem to be doing that or at least come off that way",

Yes that person went through shit too but even you admitted what they did was extremely wrong however my issue with you right now is you are focusing on me rather than the event as if I'm also to blame here. I've been trying to be respectful but at this point I just got to tell you to shut the fuck up because your clearly bring a hypocrite like everyone else in the trans community",

I just put a extremely emotional and tragic even that happened to me that was so emotional damaging to me I can't even go though home town and felt like I had to leave over it and the first and only thing anyone has said is \"your transphobic\" not just you but everyone who is in the trans community. Not a single person took the time to agree that what this person had done is fucked up on so many levels. Just attack me. And I know your going to try to find a way to flip this on me but in reality I don't find all trans ppl this toxic. I only remember it when I encounter a trans person. The ones that don't claim to be part of the trans community are the best ones because they don't jump to attack someone from what I found however you seem to be doing that or at least come off that way",

Do you Honestly believe that past Trauma is justification to doing something wrong ? Because if you do you are not only validating this Transgenders but ever rapist and murder as well.",

I came here to vent my emotions to let them go and you and everyone else are blaming me. \n\nSo you understand what you are doing I gave given you examples like rape and I'll give you another example of what your doing. \n\nRight now what you are telling me is no different from you telling a women \n\n\"Well if you wear a super short skirt of course guys are going to look at you sexual and you have a higher chance of risk\". \n\nI don't care about that person's traumas because they gave me trauma. Yes that person went through shit too but even you admitted what they did was extremely wrong however my issue with you right now is you are focusing on me rather than the event as if I'm also to blame here. I've been trying to be respectful but at this point I just got to tell you to shut the fuck up because your clearly bring a hypocrite like everyone else in the trans community",

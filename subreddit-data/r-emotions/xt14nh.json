(Possibly) but yes in most cases it\u2019s like that. Another example is when I went through a break up (I broke up with him) I told myself I\u2019m supposed to feel sad about this so I displayed sad emotions and realized that over a month period I was displaying sadness (as I intended) but i didn\u2019t feel it? (I was also isolating myself and not talking to other as much) and I realized that I quite literally was wrapped in my own head to see that I was isolating (I thought others weren\u2019t talking to me)",

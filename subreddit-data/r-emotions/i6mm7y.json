(Try not to blame, it's not constructive for your relationship with the person.)\n  \nWe have our opions/self-image and because we have them would could be embarrassed (\"I did something wrong here?\"). For this kind of embarrassedment you can't blame the other. The best thing to do is selfreflect on why you have those thoughts &amp; feelings and analyse your opions and self-image. Decide if they are still correct. We have a lot of old opinions and a self-image that might not be useful anymore.\n\nThat's my opinion.",

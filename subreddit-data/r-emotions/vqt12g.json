    "postText": "I feel so unmotivated and suicidal and nothing matters as much as it used to. I\u2019m trying really hard but I feel like I\u2019m letting my career go. I\u2019m a brand new real estate agent and since it happened I haven\u2019t had motivation to do it or do anything at that. I just work at my normal day job and am going through the motions with this continuous lingering feeling of suicide. It\u2019s been 3 months. I don\u2019t know what to do, I do but I can\u2019t get up and do it.",

Maybe professional help might be a start? Or local support groups? Your not alone, I\u2019m a great listener if you\u2019d like to talk to me. I\u2019m truly sorry, But know your strong, and you\u2019ll get past this, and you\u2019ll be much stronger, I know this. Try engaging in happy hobbies or things you enjoy.",

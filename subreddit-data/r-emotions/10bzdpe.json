    "postText": "So, once upon a time I was diagnosed provisionally with autism spectrum disorder as an adult, and I know I post a lot of questions about this, but it's in the back of my mind that either I was misdiagnosed or my brain's gone through some changes as I've aged, and I'd really like to figure out which it is.\n\nOne obvious difference is I sometimes perceive emotional information from my environment very strongly, to the point where I can't interact with certain things without feeling discomfort, like right now it's a weird uncomfortable dark prickly feeling--I guess it's supposed to be fear? I don't usually feel it like this, though--when looking at pictures of snakes, spiders, and/or sci-fi/horror creatures . I find this aggravating because when I'm not like this these things don't bother me at all.\n\nI'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if so, what do you think it could be? I spoke to my psychaitrist, but one thing we never touched on was if she thinks my autism diagnosis is valid in light of the new symptoms, and if not, what could it be?",

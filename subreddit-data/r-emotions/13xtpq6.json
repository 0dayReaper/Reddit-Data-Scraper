Not medical advice obv because it Reddit haha but you may want to research \u2018triggers\u2019 as a starting point. \n\nIt sounds like there may be a wound which is covered up by a defensive state (tendency towards anger or what might seem like an extreme reaction), which tends to have some similarities. \n\nBy understanding what wound may be underneath the situation, you can then do some self work or work with a therapist or coach to heal it. \n\nIf it turns out to be a wound that is indicative of trauma (abuse, tragic loss, narcissism in the family, or other heavier topics), a proper trauma trained therapist is best.",

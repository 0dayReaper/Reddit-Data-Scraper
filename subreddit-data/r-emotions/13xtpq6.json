    "postText": "How do you get out of a bad headspace when you no longer have reason to be in it? \n\nThere's a thing I've been looking to do for a few weeks.  Today is the perfect day to do it and I had talked it over with my family last night.  My husband knows it's a thing I'm trying to do. \nIt's a family thing involving me, hubby, and stepkid.  Stepkid needs to come with us. \n\nWell hubby got home today and made a statement worded to the effect that thing I want to do would have to be postponed.  When I expressed frustration with that he backed up and was all like \"no that's not what I'm saying, there's no issue still doing it today\".  He miss worded his statement or maybe I misunderstood him, but that's it.  It's resolved, and my plans are still in place.  \n\nBut in that moment of misunderstanding I got incredibly frustrated and sad about a missed opportunity because had it been missed, I would've probably had to wait like 3 weeks, and while that's not what's happening at all, it's like I can't get outta that headspace of being upset about something when I have no reason to be upset.  \n\nWhy am I like this?!!",

Not medical advice obv because it Reddit haha but you may want to research \u2018triggers\u2019 as a starting point. \n\nIt sounds like there may be a wound which is covered up by a defensive state (tendency towards anger or what might seem like an extreme reaction), which tends to have some similarities. \n\nBy understanding what wound may be underneath the situation, you can then do some self work or work with a therapist or coach to heal it. \n\nIf it turns out to be a wound that is indicative of trauma (abuse, tragic loss, narcissism in the family, or other heavier topics), a proper trauma trained therapist is best.",

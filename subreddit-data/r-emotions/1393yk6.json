    "postText": "To keep things short, my wife and I have birthdays 2 weeks apart and we have a tradition of paying for everything on each others birthday. On her birthday we went to a theme park and ate at an expensive restaurant she's always wanted to go to. I paid for everything. My birthday is next week and my wife told me she can't afford to pay for our outing AND dinner at the restaurant I picked. I told her I would pay for the restaurant since it would be the most expensive part of the day. \n\nI told her it was ok and I don't mind paying but I really do. It makes me so upset and emotional that I need to pay for my own birthday dinner. I am the breadwinner in our house and have been paying for all our daily expenses and I was looking forward to having one special day where I don't have to pay for anything. \n\nHow can I feel better about paying for my own birthday dinner?\n\nCome context if you want some. The restaurant I chose is expensive and very hard to get reservations for. I've been dreaming of eating there for YEARS, and I don't want to eat anywhere else. Also, the reason she can't afford it is that her work hours have been drastically cut (she barely makes $150 a week right now)",

    "postText": "Tw ig: mentions of yelling, self harm, eating disorders, parents being kinda shit, mental illness in general ig? oh and wanting to die.\n\n\ni have had a rough day, lots of arguing with my dad, he invalidated my feelings a lot earlier but whatever that's fine, not why im here. \n\nhe suggested i see someone for my issues and i really don't want to, i guess im just scared but also ive done so much research, went to therapy, asked so many people, and nothing helps, so how is this person going to be different? so obviously i decline the offer and he doesn't push it.\n\nthen we get home and he says very offhand like \"if this goes on you might need to go somewhere ro help you get better. i am a minor, so he could definitely force me to go somewhere, i wouldn't have any choice. and that terrifies me. thats literally another reason i don't want to go to therapy. so that was nice.\n\noh, and on top of that, he said i basically have an eating disorder, the way ive been eating lately. and he's not wrong but i don't want him to know and so now im scared of that, and like he kept commenting on my eating all day.\n\nand he keeps suggesting like god related stuff cuz christian family but like a) i don't think im a christian anymore, i certainly don't want to be, and b) im literally queer and trans like the christians he knows would probably WANT me to die if they knew about all that.\n\nso yeah. scared of being sent somewhere, scared he knows, and angry because why can't he just fuck off? he says he does everything because he cares about me, because he loves me. and yet when i say im scared when he yells he just scoffs and tells me to get over it. when im sobbing because he's yelling at me, when i literally beg him to stop yelling, he doesn't fucking care. if he actually cared he would just leave me alone and not do things that make me hurt myself or want to fucking die.",

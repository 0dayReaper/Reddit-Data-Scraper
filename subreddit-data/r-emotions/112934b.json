    "postText": "I'm(M21)  an only son with very elderly parents and sick parents. Mother has Schizophrenia and father is post stroke with diabetes. Recently my dads been out of hospital and atm its the second time he's in there fighting for his life however I've accepted the fact that he is going to pass away soon quite a while ago and I do not cry or get that emotional about it. Even when my mum is telling me bad news I don't even cry or get upset I just sort of say okay. I've dealt with sick parents my whole childhood(mum in and out of mental hospital) and this has definitely toughed me up but I'm at the point where if and when my dad passes away I think I'm past the grieving stage already and my main focus would be just to look after my mum for a bit and make sure she's okay. Is this bad and do people have the right to call me out for not being emotional enough in this situation ?",

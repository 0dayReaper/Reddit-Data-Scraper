    "postText": "I silent cry.  I'd get away with it too if my nose didn't run like a tap. I don't even remember being yelled at for crying, but I knew it wasn't an appreciated way of expression - only girl in a house ful of boys in the 80s, crying made everyone uncomfortable, and I'd be considered unstable/dramatic if I did cry, but raging was acceptable, but only for boys.  Girls don't act like that.  So I'd go 'read a book' or potter about, facing away as tears would stream down my face.    \n\n\nI'm 40 now,  I silent cried last night.  I've not seen my family for 2 years. My grandma is on her last legs.  I have new baby niblings I've never seen and are already walking. I miss my homeland.  We planned to go with the kids this winter, booked the flights, then got cold feet, because, Covid.... I'm upset. I know it's madness to go to my homeland as the numbers are really bad there and winter means stuck indoor, so I agreed with my husband - let's postpone it until maybe April, or even later.  I know in my gut it's not wise to go, but I'm upset. I got up after our chat to \"potter\", and cleaned the oven whilst I silently cried.  I started sniffing.  My husband got angry because he thought I was trying to manipulate him into going.  I'm not. I lost my rag, \"I AM ALLOWED TO BE SAD ABOUT NOT GOING!\", he said that I agreed we shouldn't go.  I said I do agree we shouldn't go, he couldn't understand, if I agree, why am I crying?  It was then I realized how toxic society is towards tears.    \n\n\nI silent cry and it is physically painful, my chest throbs and my jaw aches, I feel like I'm choking from my effort to keep it contained.  It literally physically hurts to cry like this. I once drove to a secluded beach, turned the volume on my radio ridicilously high and loudly sobbed.  It's the first time crying worked for me... maybe I should do that more often... It's tiring justifying my silent tears, let alone having to start justifying loud sobs.  \n\n\nI just realised my little girl sometimes silent cries (she's 7).  I think I need to take a long hard look at myself and the message I'm sending out to my kids - I want them to be able to cry as they needs.  \n\n\nNo real point to this post, but to get it off my chest.",

            "comment": "I feel sad for you. Crying is a natural \u2018safety valve\u2019 to release the stress chemicals we don\u2019t use for \u2018fight or flight\u2019 and replace them with soothing ones. Not being able to express our non violent feelings is emotional torture.  \nMany men, when faced with a crying person, feel frustrated because the solution to the problem isn\u2019t obvious. Typically, boys/men are not brought up to show emotional \u2018softness\u2019 and receptivity. Stoic toughness is vital to avoid bullying in school and \u2018no one likes a crybaby\u2019 is a common message.  \nSo your husband needs to have it explained to him that very often the only thing required of him when you cry is to hug you and accept your expression of sadness. If he doesn\u2019t know what to say, instead of the useless \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d he can just say \u201cIt\u2019s ok to cry.\u201d   \nHe doesn\u2019t have to \u2018solve\u2019 it, just allowing you to feel able to be yourself is enough. And highly therapeutic.",

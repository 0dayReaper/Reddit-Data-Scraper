    "postText": "I\u2019ve become so emotion after I started ignoring my friends because I felt left out and I really don\u2019t know why, I want to cry everyday and for no reason. The boy I liked asked out my best friend and I can\u2019t help but hate them, every time I look at them I get all teary it\u2019s annoying. I dont like it when people talk to me when I\u2019m upset so when my dad came up to me and was talking to me I was only responding in sound not words, he got so annoyed he asked me why he\u2019s even planing a quinceanera for me and I was going to say that he was pressured into it by our family and that he didn\u2019t even want to like when I asked him he was like why and I said I was his only daughter so why not he responded,\u201d I can just have another one\u201d oh, ok so he hates me good to know I hate him I hate everyone I hate my mom I hate my life I hate my friends and I hate myself",

Start learning techniques to shift and control your emotional state and your life will change. Also, what Carl said too. It's tough being young. I have definitely been there. It will get better as you get older. Especially if you start learning things like the above.",

    "postText": "I can't find any copies of a similar topic, so I'm sorry if this is repetitive. However, I have been bothered by this. I've been apathetic lately. Maybe it's because of the coronavirus and being stuck at home. I liked chatting with people, for example, now I have no interest in people. I'm getting irritated by my best friend, although she's done no harm. I need to start caring again, or I'll ruin all of my friendships. Will this pass? It happened out of nowhere, and my parents wouldn't understand. I am completely fine except for stopping caring about people and things that mattered a lot to me.",

            "comment": "I could be wrong but I think the way your feeling is normal. Due to COVID I\u2019ve feel like my emotions have been all over the place and sometimes I can get extremely irritated. I think this will pass. You\u2019re probably heavily affected by everything going on right now. When ever I feel like this, I know it\u2019s time for me to take a break and have some alone time, or do something that makes me feel happy. I\u2019ve recently gotten into painting, so maybe you might want to try that out. I also write in a journal and let all my emotions out. I hope this helps you. I send my love \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

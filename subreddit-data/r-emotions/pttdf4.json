    "postText": "I don\u2019t know where to begin. I\u2019m at 21 year old guy and am at the point of my life right now where I\u2019m looking for a full time job for the first time. I don\u2019t know how but suddenly it hit me that I\u2019m growing up now and suddenly everything is making me cry. I don\u2019t usually cry, my emotions are usually locked up if that makes sense but it\u2019s all rushing out at once and it\u2019s too much. Whenever I think of my little sisters growing up now and finishing school, or me having to move away from my parents eventually i have to fight back tears. Even spending time with my extended family who I see almost every day makes me emotional. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it was very difficult to write this down. I don\u2019t know why this is happening or what I should do. I feel like I want to spend time with them but I get emotional whenever I do, the thought of doing other stuff I usually do like seeing friends or playing video games or even watching a movie doesn\u2019t appeal to me. \n\nThank you for reading this, if anyone has any explanation for why this is happening or any ideas even, please let me know.",

The world is a scary place to venture into, just try to take it one day at a time and set little goals for yourself. If you take on too much at once and keep looking at the bigger picture it will become overwhelming and discourage you.",

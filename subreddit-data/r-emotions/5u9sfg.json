    "postText": "I always feel like I am seeking attention or sympathy or pity when I share my feelings. I argue with myself about whether I should talk to friends about myself. I want to be happy and fun and emotionally open for other people. As soon as I start to share I feel like an idiot like \"you just made everything weird, you didnt think that through wtf??\" I get a pit in my stomach after I share, like everyone has issues who am I to give them mine. I don't know how or who to express myself with. I feel like I grew up trying to keep everything deep down so I could move on handle it myself be there for others. I hate feeling so much I hate not being able to share and I hate myself for being so weak. \n",

    "postText": "I have difficulties describing my emotions in words, but I can do it for experiences that make me feel those emotions. \n\nI sometimes get this feeling, it's not like feeling trapped or upset at my life. it's simply the desire to do something amongst a many list of things, but there's this common feeling shared between them that I can't explain, and need help with.\n\nhere are the sort of experiences that I think all have that similar feeling;\n\nStanding in an open pasture, during winter. feeling the cold breeze upon your face, as you watch the grey grasses wave in the wind. you, an outlier, your face a little chill, nose slightly red, yet you feel warm from your puffy jacket. no animals, no people, no cars or roads. just you, a pasture, and distant forests in sight.\n\nin an atelier, working early in the morning, as you feel the warmth of the new dawn erupt from great windows on the ceiling. beams of sunlight walk throughout the room, dust shining in the air as you stare disheveled yet content at your progress.\n\nsitting at the end of a long dirt road, atop a rocky hill. you sit, in still chilly air, as you watch the sun set and the stars come out to play. the chirping of crickets, the twinkling of stars, as you sit and watch them pass by.\n\nI don't know what emotion it is, but I feel it a lot, and it's starting to annoy me that I can't pin down what exactly it is. melancholy? there certainly is some of it in there, where it feels as though that moment is one I will never experience again; one that truly grasps at the present that I live every day yet never fully comprehend. yet It may be part of a bigger whole, there is some other emotions that mix it up that I can't describe. There is a certain stillness to all of these, one where it feels like time has stopped and I am truly alive, yet not in an exciting and adventurous way, but in an old and weathered sense. Perhaps a \"stop to smell the roses\" moment?",

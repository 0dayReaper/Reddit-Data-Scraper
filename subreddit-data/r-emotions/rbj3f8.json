He gave me advice and listened when I was overwhelmed with school. He gave me advice on every facet of life I had and he never asked for anything other than I do my job good to our restaurants standards. My biological father wasn\u2019t really around a lot so having someone step in, even for a short time as a joke, meant the world to me. I loved states but I will never forget you. When I turn 21 I\u2019m gonna get fucked up just for you Justin. I love you man!",

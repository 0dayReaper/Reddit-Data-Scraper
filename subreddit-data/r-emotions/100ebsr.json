If the stress/fear/negative emotions get too high to bear, the brain is capable of shutting them down. (Look into dissociation if you\u2019re interested)\n\nYou\u2019ll feel kinda bored, maybe a bit empty. Disconnected from reality. Even extremely sad events will fail to get an emotional response out of you. You will either feel emotions in a muffled manner or not feel them at all.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t experience them though. You\u2019re just largely not aware of them.\nInstead of standard emotions you might later find yourself tense for several hours, unable to relax, unable to connect to people or your hobbies, struggling to feel happiness while doing them despite seeming and feeling totally ok on the outside. The emotions will still affect you subconsciously, even if you don\u2019t feel them.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to, try to work through the stressful events with a therapist or friend who could genuinely hear you out. The first step to leaving the dissociated state is processing the negative emotions that caused them. Again- it\u2019s a defense mechanism. It will pass once your body feels like it\u2019s safe to experience emotions fully again.",

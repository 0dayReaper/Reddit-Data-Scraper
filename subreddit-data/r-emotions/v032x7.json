    "postText": "You ever get thoughts in your head that pop up randomly? I mean extra random as hell cuz this is one. Basically I just thought about my sister's wedding. She got married last June, she's my half sister. Our dad was in the wedding, she's got another half sister who was in it after she told me that sisters husband passed away at some point. Our brother lives in another city than us but I'm sure if he lived here, he might've been in it too. The thing is she's invited me to stuff before and I didn't make it for whatever reason but it's not like I've never been to anything. She's got a friend from her old job or whichever job that was in it and I was surprised cuz I knew they were cool but not like that, the girl was over her house when I was over that at some point but this isn't a friend she's known since childhood though. I found out about the engagement cuz my friend mentioned it to me about a fb post (I don't have fb) and when I asked my sister, she said yeah she's engaged, I asked why wasn't I invited, she said they invited people who usually come to stuff (it was a birthday party) although I hadn't been to everything, I still felt left out not only from the engagement but the wedding especially. I'm just looking like I don't matter to people and if I ever get married, nobody will be there cuz I don't have a lot of friends. I still think I could've been included since she had her other sister in it but it is what it is and I'm honestly still hurt by it a lil bit but again, it is what it is. All I can do is live my life and pretty much exclude her from stuff I suppose. When I would go over to her house years ago, I even mentioned at the mall before we should go get our nails done together but nope so I tried to do stuff with her, people just forget about me",

This is why I stopped speaking to people from years ago cuz I'd always text people first but they never texted me first unless they're replying back. I still have people like that in my phone like my brother for example, he'll text me when I text him. When I did this years ago, people would text me when I texted them but every now and then would text me first so I stopped doing it. I just can't put all my energy into that cuz it's draining. Basically I can't force people to wanna hit me up, I can't force people to wanna hang with me so I gotta stop being so nice and caring. As for a wedding for myself, you're right! I might have a small one and it'll be people there who really genuinely care about me.",

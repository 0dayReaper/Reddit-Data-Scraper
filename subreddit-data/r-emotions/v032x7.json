This is why I stopped speaking to people from years ago cuz I'd always text people first but they never texted me first unless they're replying back. I still have people like that in my phone like my brother for example, he'll text me when I text him. When I did this years ago, people would text me when I texted them but every now and then would text me first so I stopped doing it. I just can't put all my energy into that cuz it's draining. Basically I can't force people to wanna hit me up, I can't force people to wanna hang with me so I gotta stop being so nice and caring. As for a wedding for myself, you're right! I might have a small one and it'll be people there who really genuinely care about me.",

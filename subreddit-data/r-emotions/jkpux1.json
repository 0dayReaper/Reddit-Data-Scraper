It\u2019s almost like I lose the fear of dying a little bit and don\u2019t care whether or not I\u2019m in a dangerous situation. I suppose I should also clarify I don\u2019t suffer from depression. I have pmdd, a disorder that affects the way your brain responds to certain hormones and extreme sadness is a symptom. Was just wondering if anyone else feels this strong connection between their sadness and fearlessness?",

    "postText": "I made a pretty decent step in my career and I'm super excited about it, but I don't have anyone I feel comfortable sharing it with. I'm an actor and I started getting in contact with a very prominent casting director/agent and I'm super excited because this is a really big deal for me, especially after screaming into the void of the entertainment industry for almost 3 years. I didn't feel comfortable sharing this info with any of my \"friends\" because most of them are actors and a lot of actors can be very jealous and I didn't want any of that bad juju but I wanted to share so YAY! Super motivated and inspired right now!!",

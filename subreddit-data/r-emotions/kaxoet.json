    "postText": "Where do Our Human Emotions and Facial Expressions comes from ?? \n\nDid you know, there are 43 muscles in the human face which can be activated in different combinations to create thousands of voluntary expressions. There are seven universal emotions, namely, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, contempt, surprise and enjoyment. There may be other emotions that don\u2019t have a signal but one of the prime characteristics of an emotion is that others know how you\u2019re feeling. Why do we have a particular expression for a particular emotion ?? This question was put forward by Darwin in 1872 in his book Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.\u00a0\n\nAccroding to Darwin, Man and Animals show emotions with similar behaviour. He was mainly concerned with How Emotions look like ? According to him, emotion had an evolutionary history that could be traced across cultures and species.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Later Dr. Paul Ekman and his team studied Darwin's Theory on Universality of Facial Expressions. To find answers to the study, they had to find the people who were completely isolated from the Media and from influence from rest of the world. A simple experiment was conducted showing them pictures of different people and asking them to make up a story based on the picture they saw.\u00a0\n\nThe experiment clearly established that each emotion has its own unique signal or facial expression and is not acquired through culture or any other influence. Darwin\u2019s theory was proven right. The face is the primary display system of emotions behind the brain inside which all the functions of emotion take place. Our facial expressions show our emotions.\u00a0\n\nThe facial expression come from the area of the brain which we don\u2019t have control over. They are largely involuntary. Only about 5% of the population can completely inhibit any expression. A term called \u2018micro facial expression\u2019 is used to define the leakage in the muscle that indicates if someone is telling the truth or lying.\u00a0\n\nFacial Action Coding System was the first instrument that allowed us to specify how many different expressions a person can make. It is widely used today in advertising to entertainment animation films.\n\nWatch Full Video : [https://youtu.be/crM7JczVTXU](https://youtu.be/crM7JczVTXU)",

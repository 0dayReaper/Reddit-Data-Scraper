That fase has passed, i'm going to focus on other things now.\n\nI'm proud the sub has grown the past year from about 800 membert to 1.2K members and that i've at least helped some people find some peace and insight.\n\nI deleted my posts, comments and advices back to a year. And I'm resigning as mod (I still have to figure out how though...)\n\nStay healthy and take care of yourself!\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!",

    "postText": "I'll prob delete this later but I need a space to rant.\nThis month's been shit, my groupmates are shit. And I know that most of the mistakes I've made are my own fault but I'm trying my goddamn best to improve them. \n\nMy mom's in the room next down but I want to fucking scream and this sucks ass.\n\nIt feels like no matter how hard I try sometimes, things are just going to spiral down and I hate it.\n\nIt's hard to look up and I want everyone who says that I need to do it to shut up.\n\nIt's frustrating that I need to look at others and accomodate to them honestly it's tiring.  I want to yell at someone. Blame someone. Anything. I wish someone was, as a whole, an ass or has zero redeeming qualities sometimes just so I can yell and punch at them.\n\nI want to stop feeling empathy. If it's makes me an ass? Fine. But at least I don't need to feel like a pent-up, restrained and frustrated piece of shit. \n\nI know this is just really negative and I'm sorry but I just had a really bad day and any sound from anything else really just makes it worse.\n\nYou know, I never knew crying and laughing at the same time was a thing until it happened to me. You get so frustrated to tears but find the thing you were frustrated at so funny that you end up hysterical. So, unable to choose to do which, you do both. \n\nI'm sorry, again, for the negativity but I'm just so done with this and need a hug.",

    "postText": " Lately I've been so angry with people. All people like family, friends, coworkers and people in everyday life. I just want people to leave me alone and stop bugging me. Seriously feel like snapping sometimes. And then while I have the opportunity to finally have some peace I start feeling lonely. Depressed becomes I'm single and always will be. Think about things like how I'm going to die alone and I have nobody to talk to about my day or what I should make for dinner. To the point of crying. This is getting old. I'm an intelligent man and I have common sense and reasoning. All makes it more frustrating.",

Don't wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope",

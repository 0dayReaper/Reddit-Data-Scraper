    "postText": "Backstory: Growing up I never showed many emotions, even as a baby my mum jokes I had perminant poker face with very few smiles or tears.\n\nAge 10+ I would have days of endless crying for no reason. I feel 'fine' other than just desperately wanting to be with my mum or dad and have the physical attention. During school the teachers knew that on the odd occasion it happened I would just raise my hand and leave the room. I'd go to sit with the head teacher who was very kind until mum or dad could come get me.\n\nThis persisted until about 16 where the tears ended. I would still have times where I feel incredibly sad and want physically attention but at that point I could get hugs and be held by either my parent's or now a partner.\n\nAt times of anger I feel the inner rage but if it involves confrontation I will then burst into tears. That further fuels the cycle of impotent rage because outwardly I'm sobbing. I would write letters to my parents detailing what annoyed me if I needed to discuss it because if I tried in person I would just end up hyperventilating between tears.\n\nAnd now to present day and my question for help and advice.\n\nI play a lot of games, do a wide variety of hobbies and walk/run lots. This is ALL so I am NEVER at a loss for what to do. If I have a moment where I'm not distracted by something 'fun' I feel utterly lost and sad. \n\nNothing feels fun and I feel like I'm desperately trying to grab hold of a distraction and something to do. It has the plus side that if I ever intentionally 'switch off' and take a moment to close my eyes I fall asleep within minutes anywhere, and I truly mean anywhere.\n\nBut there are times where I feel the opposite.\n\nLike just now (hence this post) I feel like there is a burning ball of liquid fire, or a ribbon of energy that desperately wants me to grab hold and let it race through me. I want to jump up, shout at the top of my lungs, run as fast as I can, punch screens and scream in joy as I embrace it.... but I have to sit quietly at work etc while inside there is a tempest.\n\nWhy, the moment I'm not distracted, do I flip flop from feeling stranded in dispare to feeling like a lightning bolt of unbridled rage.\n\nThings that might be relevant and il be blunt and honest for this.\n1. When I lose people close to me like my grandad I honestly feel nothing.\n2. I don't really think about anything. Sure if I'm in a game my brain is processing that, or if I am writing this then I'm formulating sentences. But there are rarely active thoughts.\n3. When I read I don't visualise a single thing.\n4. When I dream however. Its every night in clear detail. I frequently visit the same dream location and can navigate to now regions of the area I recognise. I can stop and rewind dreams to change outcomes and have not had a nightmare since I was about 10.\n5. And finally, my memory. Regarding physical locations is great and crystal but for anything else its beyond shocking. \n\nAnd input would be greatly appreciated.",

    "postText": "It feels like I have lost my way, as if I was now meaning to do something but now cannot recall what I was going to do. It feels like I am walking across a beach, along the wet sand with the sunset sky shimmering a warm red glow onto my feet. The gentle waters of the ocean tide rolling back and forth, while occasionally licking the tip of my toes with its cold embrace. As I walk, my feet begin weighted with the moist sand resting on the edges of my foot, a trail of footsteps stretch unto the horizon from where I came, never straying far from the edge of the shore. I suddenly stop, to look at the setting sun now disappearing beneath the horizon, its light reflecting and dazzling the gentle surface of the ocean with a thousand ponds of brightness. Its glow reaching to the depths of the sky while gradually disappearing like a painters gradient, coating the entire world with infinite shades of orange. As I gaze, I become aware of the meditative trance that has been evoked in me and my consciousness shifts the linear path I must take.\n\n I stare into the horizon, into which my journey must continue, however, I now cannot remember the task I had set to accomplish. A trail of footsteps stretch from my feet, forward into the depths where the sky and land meet, as if my shadow has travelled forth, taking my footprints with it but leaving my body behind. I know the way I must go, elucidated further by these phantom footprints, but now, for what reason? Why must I go? Or perhaps, did I really know where my journey\u2019s end would be when I first set out. Yet, as a I stand, with the dying light of the sun casting longer and longer shadows of the footprints that have set forth without me, I cannot remember why I have embarked on this journey. An infinity of steps stretch from behind and in front of me, and, in the darkness, I cannot remember which I am yet to step into or which I have just cast onto the world. The crushing weight of weightlessness enters my soul but it does not liberate it. Meaning and destiny vanishes with the setting sun. I am a mirage of myself, with no end nor beginning, no path nor belief. Anguish rises in the void of my chest and grows with its beating fire into all the crevices of my being. The only entity in this shadowed landscape is despair, for now I have been doomed to walk an eternity.",

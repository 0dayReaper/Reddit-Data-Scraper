    "postText": "We react to certain things, we're attracted to certain things, and we can get addicted to certain things, because we're more emotional creatures than logical ones. That's why the world will always be chaotic in a sense. No matter how much technology, human understanding, possible engineering, and science exists, we will always struggle with our emotions. We're pretty primitive if you think about it; since the beginning of time, all life on earth has an us vs them. We compete, and have negative emotions such as envy and resentment just like animals do. We're just as capable of being lethal, arguably humans are the most lethal being on top of the food chain.\n\nWe're animals.",

In my short experience with this (I am still not very good at it and often find myself appealing to comfort zones like logic and reason) I am coming to realize the power of emotion. I always thought of emotions as a great weakness, however I now agree that they are an integral part of our humanity and can be a useful source of power",

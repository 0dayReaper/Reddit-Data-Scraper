    "postText": "I'm scared and im worried and im sad and im mad the only thing i cant feel is happy.   I dated this boy for almost a year I know he's planning to dump me but i guess up until now i just kinda denied it. What if it's real what if he relly is leaving me? What am i going to do? I'm scared i don't wanna be left. I'm worried. I've been sad since my mom told me he was planing to leave me and I'm so mad at myself for letting this happen. I didn't try hard enough to keep him from pushing me away and he pushed me away. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna be broken again but i know thatss what hes gonna do",

            "comment": "You have to learn to be ok on your own, or you\u2019ll always be vulnerable and too dependent on a boyfriend for your sense of wellness. If he doesn\u2019t want to be with you that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you, but you can\u2019t hold on to someone longer than they want to stay. You have to be yourself and find someone who likes you as you are. Trying to be someone else to keep a boyfriend won\u2019t work and it won\u2019t make you happy. With each relationship you can learn what\u2019s best for you and be more selective about who you go out with. Ask yourself if there\u2019s something in your past that makes you particularly vulnerable to losing someone, that may be the root of your need. There are hypnotherapy tools online which can help you feel more confident and capable within yourself, maybe it\u2019s worth  looking at those.",

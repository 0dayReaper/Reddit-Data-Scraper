            "comment": "The short answer is: No.\n\nWe can learn to ignore and suppress our emotions and, for a time, we might be able to pretend we're emotionless but all of them are still there.\n\nOur physical and emotional feelings are only signals giving us feedback on our external and internal world. If we feel cold, the feeling is only a signal informing us of the ambient temperature. The feeling isn't the cause of the cold, it's the result of our location and situation. We can teach ourselves to withstand or ignore the cold but the cold is still there and the body is still feeling it.\n\nIf we feel angry, the feeling is only a signal informing us that something is bothering us. The feeling isn't the cause but the symptom of the problem. Something or someone is bothering us and our feelings are there to let us know so we can take steps to resolve it. And just like the cold, if we only ignore or suppress our feelings of anger then the cause of our anger is still there and we're still feeling bothered.\n\nInstead of trying to remove your emotions, find a way to safely release and address them instead. And if you're at a point where you want to find a way to permanently remove them, it must be a lot so it won't be easy and it's best if you had someone to help you with them.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPaths In the Void\n\n[Paths In the Void podcast](https://pathsinthevoid.transistor.fm/)",

                            "comment": "From my point of view, it's not really anger that's the issue but how you view failing at things. You're linking your feelings of failing (disappointment) to mean that you're a failure which isn't true (even if other people say you are).\n\nSo instead of looking to get rid of your feelings you should be looking to get rid of this perspective of Failure.\n\nFor one thing, it's normal to fail at things. They're usually the fastest way we learn. It also means we're pushing outside our comfort zone which is our way to grow. Of course we don't want to purposely fail but it's not bad if we do. \n\nIf you look up Thomas Edison, he failed 1000s of times before getting the light bulb right. But he learned from those failed attempts. Instead of seeing them as Failures, he saw them as Lessons instead.\n\nEveryone who is good at anything has failed at what they're good at. Through practice they learn what to do and through failing they learn what Not to do. We need both to really understand what we're doing.\n\nBut even with the change of perspective, the feeling of disappointment will still be there and it should because it's a sign that we care. If we fail at something and we don't care then maybe it's time to do something else.\n\nSo instead of beating yourself up and judging yourself as a failure or believing the judgment of others. Take those feelings and use them as fuel to try again. If you try your best and it fails, then your best just got better because you've learned one more thing about it. And if you keep repeating this cycle, it's guaranteed you'll become good (if not great) at anything you do.\n\nHope that helps\n\nPaths In the Void\n\n[Paths In the Void podcast](https://pathsinthevoid.transistor.fm/)",

I will try now to go to a pshychologist and also try to look for some pills too from a doctor to help me with my anger and stress but i don't know if everything will be alright .I don't know if it's gonna work going to a psychologist or if i even have the patience to do that . It would be better if i just hurt myself or just die bcs i don't wanna end up hurting others .",

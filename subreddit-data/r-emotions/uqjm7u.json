    "postText": "\nHas anyone ever felt emotional numbness to the point where you feel physically numb ? I dont know how to explain it. It feels like I am a walking hollow shell. A zombie, I guess you can put it. Like most of the time expressionless. There are days that I feel okay and be able to not have to force an expression. I've been feeling this way for about 10 years ? I have looked for help and have gone to therapy. I haven't gone to a therapist in awhile, unfortunately, bc my depression got bad at one point and my therapist had to drop me for being inconsistant...(I know, it was bad). For a long time, I want to feel the happiness, the love, and appreciation on where I am now, my life, my move, my relationship. I am afraid. Due to the fact that I don't often feel these emotions, I am afraid that Im not able to feel the love and happiness that the people around me has given or that they deserve. Which, I am often be there for those who need it and especially for my partner. Of course, there is more to it, it would take a million years to type everything down. Just wondering if there was anyone who felt the same way, have advice, and whatnot.",

            "comment": "It _sounds_ like you\u2019re experiencing anhedonia, which you can look up and learn about, see if it fits. There\u2019s a number of possible causes of that.   \nHere\u2019s one: A lack of enjoyment and happiness may be caused by low dopamine levels, which new research suggests may be caused by having the wrong gut bacteria, or not enough of the right bacteria.  \nWe have two brains; the second one is called the solar plexus, it\u2019s just below our stomach, and it is full of neuro receptors for dopamine and serotonin. Both of which make us feel happy and motivated, enjoying life.\n\nThe solar plexus makes our feelings. \nI\u2019ll say that again.   \nOur feelings and emotions are not made in our heads, our solar plexus makes our feelings.  \nOur emotions, our feelings of happiness and sadness, grief, guilt, excitement and pleasure, are all just twitches and tingles of specific muscle fibres around our internal organs in our abdomen, caused by the \u2018gut brain\u2019, the solar plexus.  \nThere\u2019s a big nerve, the vagus nerve, connecting our head brain ( which has our imagination and logic etc) to our gut brain, which does feelings and emotions.   \nBut our head brains do not control our feelings. 90% of the messages along that nerve go the other way, from gut to head.   \nOur imaginations up top respond to our feelings from below.  \n\nBut why do we have a special \u2018brain\u2019 to make feelings?  \nBecause feelings control every decision we make. Every action we take is prompted by how we feel about it. We do what we do because either it feels like the right thing to do, or if there\u2019s no obvious good choice, it feels like the least wrong thing to do.   \nGut feelings, gut instinct, pit of the stomach, \u2018got the stomach for it\u2019. We\u2019ve been describing where our feelings are for thousands of years.    \n\nThe specific stimulation point which creates a feeling of \u2018dread\u2019 is horizontally and vertically the same as, and approximately 1cm back from, the point which creates \u2018happy excitement\u2019. That\u2019s how precise it is. \nDread will stop you from going out and pursuing fun things, it\u2019ll drag you down and suck any joy out of life. Happy excitement is like Christmas morning, anything\u2019s possible and life is great!  \nAnd those two opposite feelings are created only a centimetre or so apart, by the solar plexus stimulating a very specific part of the muscle fibres around our internal organs. In this case, about two fingers below our sternum, centrally. It\u2019s all physical biology.\n\nCheck out Barral Technique abdominal massage, it\u2019s an osteopathic treatment which soothes the muscles that the solar plexus uses to make our feelings. People I know personally have experienced huge release of stress and feelings of great lightness and happiness after one treatment.  \nAlso try a healthy gut bacteria supplement. A lot of people these days have problems there, and it\u2019s an easy place to start.   \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-second-brain/\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/gut-bacteria-on-the-brain/395918/\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-find-possible-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-depression-180971411/\n\nhttps://verv.com/visceral-manipulation-massage/amp/",

    "postText": "Like, the other day I was crying for about an hour. It was so intense that my head almost hurt. But I didn't notice many vibrant feelings that were going through me when I was crying like I used to.  This doesn't relate to just sadness, but happiness and a multitude of other emotions as well. This concerns me greatly, and I'm not sure if it's just because of COVID or what, but I wish I could have my emotions back. It could be that they are there and I just don't directly sense it, but I honestly don't know.",

It's not numbness or lack of passion because the passion and feeling is still definitely there- you just don't feel it occupy your mind and morph into thoughts almost\n\nOr at least that's how it is for me, but it has been even before covid\n\nI hope you're okay &lt;3 \n\nmaybe it's just a bit of apathy, like you feel the emotions but you're like eh what's the point in feeling them, nobody will see/understand/hear them anyway.",

The stuff we aren\u2019t ready to express stays until we\u2019re basically ready to express it. \n\nSo, crying over a \u2018small\u2019 event can be a sign that you\u2019ve had other emotional things piling up that your body was ready to let go of, or it can be a sign that a small event has a bigger picture, for example, your belief that you can\u2019t do things right.  \n\nThis type of belief can also accumulate a lot of smaller emotional events that pile up and express all at once. \n\nIs that helpful?",

They are signals of our bodies processing the weirdness, awesomeness, struggles of live. If you learn to welcome them rather than resist them things start to make more sense. There\u2019s soooo much intelligence in their working in our favor. So learning what we can makes life easier. Great question and thanks again for sharing courageously!",

            "comment": "Sounds like your parents use your mistakes as an excuse to vent their own frustrations and annoyance onto you?\nIf this is a common thing for them to do then this is not love.     \nPeople who grew up in a family where they were scolded or put down for mistakes often repeat the same behaviour when they become parents. Ideally a parent would see their child\u2019s mistakes as an opportunity to help them and show kindness and patience.  \n\nIt sounds as though you may have become sensitised to criticism to respond in this way.   \nThis can be the case if a child is taught that mistakes are a \u2018bad thing\u2019 and so they\u2019re a \u2018bad person\u2019 if they make a mistake.    \nSuch situations are stressful, no one wants their parents to be angry with them.   \nCrying actually enables us to destress more effectively.  \nIt releases useful substances in us like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, so it\u2019s a much healthier response than anger, which is how some people respond to criticism.  \n\nIt\u2019s a shame your parents can\u2019t just give you a hug and say \u2018Don\u2019t worry, let\u2019s work it out together.\u2019 But you can do this for yourself.    \n\nUltimately you are your own best friend, you\u2019ll be with you every day and you\u2019re the only one who will understand exactly what you feel and you can do the things for you that make life better for you.   \n\nFour other suggestions: read \u2018The Road Less Travelled\u2019, especially the chapter on Love.  \n\nhttps://www.d-pdf.com/book/1158/read\n\nLook up Non Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg for how to express your needs and listen to others too.   \n\nhttps://youtu.be/IQO7h9MNCqI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7wq2M54bDi4\n\nWhen stressed and unhappy use circular abdominal massage just below your rib cage to soothe the physical place where anxiety is felt. (The middle of the liver.)\n\n\nTry St John\u2019s Wort drops or capsules for natural stress relief if needed.",

They want to try to tell you something but we need to learn how to interpret what they mean and what the cause is. And what actions you have to take to fix the problem.\n\nThe dashboard in a car has labels or icons... we don't have them. And we know we need to check the oil when we see the oil indicator lighting up.\n\nWe need to figure out what thoughts we had or what we experienced that produced the emotion. Depression is even worse as it is often hormonal.",

It\u2019s really courageous for you to share this and I just wanted to tell you, it\u2019s quite normal to want to feel liked and accepted. It\u2019s really a fundamental human need. We developed to be social creatures so there is a lot that\u2019s happening in the body, mind spaces to be aware of social situations and to try our best to learn, understand, communicate and connect in ways that the entire being craves. Do you feel some part of your experience is unhealthy?  Have you talked with your parents about your concerns?",

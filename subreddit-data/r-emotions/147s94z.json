But you never lose it, so it's important to stop thinking that way. I suggest doing some traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people, having new experiences. Go to museums, watch great films, listen to music that lights up your soul. Don't just stare at a blank page waiting for it to come. You have to go out there and experience life and the world like a kid again. Experience that joy and wonder and love you had as a child. It never goes away, but the longer we let it stagnate, that harder it can be to get it back. You're still very young so don't worry. Just get out there and start living freely. Freedom is the most important thing for an artist.",

Could be just a normal downswing in activity. Could be growing up and just life changing. In any case, you can heal or reconnect with this if you\u2019d like to.",

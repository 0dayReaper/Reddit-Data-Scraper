    "postText": "Not literally. The love I had for art has died in me. I\u2019m (F20) a student, I would say I\u2019m pretty busy, like the only thing I do for myself besides studying or doing something related to my career, I eat and sleep. I love painting and sketching, started when I was 6 years old, it came easy to me, and then as i got busier around the age of 13 or 14 my parents were basically obsessed with me doing well in school even though I was doing great, they thought I needed more so they put me in various courses and got me tutors (even during holidays) and thus being exhausted from the day I never touched my lead pencils again.  And now for the first time where I am actually on a real summer vacation I tried sketching and I came up with literally nothing. My mind was so blank. I was literally looking at a white blank page and nothing. I don\u2019t know why but I also got this horrible feeling. I feel sad that I lost a part of me from my childhood because Art was truly an escape for me, all of my overthinking, anxieties, anger and even happiness or love all of that was drawn in a little hand sized sketch book. like why would I lose this I don\u2019t know any other way of portraying my emotions other than making sketches of them. I just want to think that the artist in me is asleep or lost and I hope I do get it back some day.",

            "comment": "You didn't lose it and it didn't die. But creativity and inspiration can go through periods of stagnation. It is something that must be cultivated and nurtured over time. But you never lose it, so it's important to stop thinking that way. I suggest doing some traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people, having new experiences. Go to museums, watch great films, listen to music that lights up your soul. Don't just stare at a blank page waiting for it to come. You have to go out there and experience life and the world like a kid again. Experience that joy and wonder and love you had as a child. It never goes away, but the longer we let it stagnate, that harder it can be to get it back. You're still very young so don't worry. Just get out there and start living freely. Freedom is the most important thing for an artist.",

Could be just a normal downswing in activity. Could be growing up and just life changing. In any case, you can heal or reconnect with this if you\u2019d like to.",

            "comment": "Hey there. Thanks for writing. Tough one, can def relate. And I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that. The first love can be really formative for following relationships, so it may be a combination of your system protecting itself at the beginning / during the relationship (so it doesn\u2019t get too invested and possibly risk that awful pain of heartbreak again..) yet your system also realizing at the point of breakup that you either had feelings for the person during the relationship or you\u2019re simply in that position of breakup again which triggers the familiar pain.  In essence, you cannot bring yourself to fully love while in the relationship bc it\u2019s not proven to be safe from past experience. And when you lose it, it\u2019s reminding you of the love you lost originally (or you\u2019re realizing it\u2019s safe for you to feel again now that the relationship is over.) Does that make sense? It can be helped with support from a trauma informed therapist which I def recommend. As you move fwd in life you\u2019ll notice these pattern loops can repeat unless you have the proper support to heal them.",

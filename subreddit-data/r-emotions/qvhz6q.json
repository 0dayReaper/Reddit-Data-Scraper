    "postText": "So I'm a pretty relaxed person(22F)  I can stay pretty calm and I'm pretty good at assessing situations in a way that helps everyone involved, (big libra energy) I'm never the type to lose my shit and freak out on someone in a fit of rage. The problem is, I've internalized and held these negative feelings and reactions in and now that I'm at a pretty low point in my life, I find myself filled with rage. My bf broke up with me and most of my friends have turned out to kind of take advantage of me and then toss me to the side, so now I don't really have an outlet to express myself to. And while I'm not the type to scream and throw things, I find myself wanting to say the meanest things to the people that hurt me or piss me off just to get some sort of release. Sometimes I even fantasize about punching some asshole in the face to release something. any tips on how to release this anger in a healthy way? I'm tired of carrying it on my back and I don't want to turn into a bitter angry person.",

            "comment": "Anger is a useful response to an immediate physical threat, override fear and pain and fight back, not something to hold on to. Sounds like you\u2019ve made some mistakes in your choice of friends and partner, and the only way really to get over the anger is to learn from this and gain wisdom from it.  \nHappiness is nice when we have it but it comes and goes, and wisdom can only be gained through suffering, that\u2019s the price we pay. We have to make mistakes to learn about ourselves.  \nSo go punch a punchbag, smash a plate or tell a rude bitch to fuck off, but also think carefully about who you are, what your \u2018buttons\u2019 are, and whether you\u2019re a) showing your true self to friends/boyfriends and b) seeing those people as they really are.   \nWe all want to be liked and appreciated and we all lie, some of us unconsciously, some deliberately. It\u2019s normal. But sooner or later the little lie of how great we are breaks down and unless we\u2019ve found real connection and willingness to be kind (love) before then, the relationship breaks down too.   \nTry circular abdominal massage to soothe the solar plexus (abdominal brain) and the muscles it twitches and tenses around our internal organs to produce the sensations we call feelings. Some osteopaths are trained in the Barral visceral manipulation technique (much the same thing) which is also very good for releasing stress.",

I'm trying to bridge that gap again and remind myself that my mind and body are part of one being. I'm also one hundred percent in the phase of my life where the concept of \"trust people's actions and not their words\" is being shoved down my throat through all these undesirable altercations. And of course, I'm still pretty young so now is the time that I'm learning all these crucial life lessons about friendships and relationships and all that, but it can be really frustrating. Especially when the people around me picked up on how to push my buttons before I even really learned what those buttons are. But, Yeah I'm on a whole journey right now, thanks for the feedback, it's helpful to hear different perspectives on this",

            "comment": "10 years ago I had a lot of trouble feeling things, I would only be angry or cry when I was so overwhelmed I couldn't stop it. Holding back those feelings was a skill I'd been building since childhood. It takes time to overcome that kind of conditioning.\n\nWhat happened to me was, whenever I'd feel something, I'd try to stop it. Even when I wanted to express it all these other feelings would come up to stop me. I'd feel stupid for wanting to cry, or for crying in front of someone. Or I'd feel scared when I was angry, scared that I'd hurt someone, physically or emotionally. Things like that. So I had to get through those feelings before I could really express the anger or fear or grief.\n\nFeelings start in your body, and the body is a great place to start getting in touch with the feeling. See if you can feel where it lives in your body. You might not be able to, that's OK. If you can tell what sort of movement or sound the feeling \"wants\" do that (what it wants is to be expressed, no more, no less, and it knows how to do it). Maybe it's rocking, or stomping, or shuddering. If you don't know what movement to do, try a bunch of them, likely one will feel more in line with the feeling than the others. Do that. Make the motions bigger. You'll probably feel stupid or scared or whatever, but it's OK, that's how you get to the feeling. Making the motion bigger is often enough to bring the emotion to the front. It's not always motion - sound is big too. Try making the sounds that the feeling wants.\n\nBasically I try to replicate a toddler meltdown. An air mattress works, but a regular bed can work too. Lay down, kick, scream and punch until you're exhausted. That's easier said than done if you feel like you're not allowed to be angry (I also tend to dissociate). What worked for me was to start doing the motions before feeling the feeling. Start kicking and yelling. It feels stupid, but it doesn't take long for your body to recognize what you're doing and bring up that anger.\n\nSometimes you need to say words you weren't allowed to say, but often it's so primitive that there aren't words, you don't know what caused the feeling, but it doesn't matter. All you need to do it let it out. It works alone, but its also great if you can have a friend there to comfort and ground you after, or help bring you back if you dissociate.",

            "comment": "When I was 21 I went through a very difficult illness for about 16 months.  I was mostly bedridden and in excruciating discomfort in that time.  30% of people that have that illness commit suicide, so just surviving is a huge accomplishment. Thankfully, I got through the worst of it and while the illness never really goes away completely I am in remission and it's been over 12 years; I'm 34 now.  But in that time of being ill and feeling rage, I tried a lot of things to work with my anger; I was so mad that my life was being taken from me.  I tried buying cheap plates and breaking them - this actually was one of the most successful outlets of anger for me.  But the best lesson I learned was how to contact my anger with compassion, allow the anger to be there, and not react to it or express it.  The key was allowing the anger to be there and not trying to stuff it away or suppress it - I still would get the anger out in the open.  I just wouldn't add more fuel to the flame by lashing out.  Learning to hold anger with loving kindness was the best lesson I learned.  These days, I still express anger, but I express it constructively, not by lashing out.  If I feel upset, I grab clay or pencil and make art.  I express my frustration in the art and I imagine the pain being absorbed by the clay or by the art.  For me, this has worked wonders.  Sound works too.  I use primal sounds and wails to express deep grief or pain.  I use singing; I sing out deep frustration or pain.  It's very healing for me.  Feeling the pain or anger and holding it with loving awareness \\[holding a compassionate presence for it\\] actually allows the anger more of a chance to resolve.  Thich Nhat Hanh writes about how strategies like pounding a pillow or other outward expressions of anger don't usually work in the long term because the anger just builds and doesn't really get released.  It's good to hold the angry feelings with mindfulness and compassion.  I heard one doctor tell a cancer patient to \"love their cancer.\"  I think this could apply to anger.  Sometimes you have to love the thing that's causing you the most trouble and make friends with it.  I think it often gets easier as you get older as you find practices to work with the anger and transmute the anger.",

I try too express through art and painting, I guess its mostly accepting the old anger I have for past betrayals that I never got closure on or things that cut so deep I kind of put them away. I'm still trying to figure out how to hold something so locked away, but I'm on this journey of self discovery and healing and you've been really helpful, thank you",

In this meditation, about halfway through, Caroline takes you to your heart chakra to connect with your emotions, particularly anger.  She asks you to review your emotions, where you might feel hurt, etc.  then you go through a process of releasing it.  Also, there is a section in the meditation where you ask your spirit to feel and think only loving thoughts as you go into the night and into the next day.  The meditation is $2.09 on audible.  You can also get it for free if you do a free 30 day trial.  I found it to be a truly transformational meditation session: [https://www.audible.com/pd/Evening-Energy-Meditation-Audiobook/B007I7GATS?source\\_code=GPAGBSH0508140001&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAkNiMBhCxARIsAIDDKNXocmwzyQYyzWU6GMC-nVnZzk\\_ocOCkeg1JBlFWiO9jLTrEYuny7dAaApCyEALw\\_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.audible.com/pd/Evening-Energy-Meditation-Audiobook/B007I7GATS?source_code=GPAGBSH0508140001&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAkNiMBhCxARIsAIDDKNXocmwzyQYyzWU6GMC-nVnZzk_ocOCkeg1JBlFWiO9jLTrEYuny7dAaApCyEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)",

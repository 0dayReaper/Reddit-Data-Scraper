    "postText": "Okay so W is E's brother and E is W's sister\n\nLet me start with some background. E and W were adopted by a (lets just say overly repetitious) couple. So they have always favored W over E... W really never gets into trouble for what he does, hes had sex and his parents never find out but E knows and but isnt Petty enough to tell on him but when she made out with her boy friend he told their parents and she had to break up with him and that really crushed her. She came to me and I helped her through it all then school got canceled. (We are in high school and in marching band) When school started back up everthing seemed a little better butz it slowly went back to how it was and she got back with her ex (they still like each other) then she got a phone but her texts went to her dads phone as well (some sort of app) but W never had to have that app and continues to try to ruin E's relationship (keep in mind W has a gf and theyve done worse than E but didnt get into trouble) [this is just the skeleton of the whole story, if I were to say it all id be here for hours] we are at the present now. The other day E's parents figured out that E is dating her ex but now they realize in the end its her decision so they dont care. But W still hates him. So W sees E with him and gives her a look so she comes to me while I was with our friend group her bf is ther too and told us about it then we start talking and as soon as W walks in one of us(a girl) says If he doesn't stop she would beat him up and then he goes \"I bet you would have fun doing that because I can't take all y'all right her right now I can beat all yalls asses\" then hI'm and his sister started yelling and I tried lightening the mood then he looked at me and says \"My name do you want a problem because I can give you a problem I can easily beat you up\" then I just stared at him (knowing I'm bigger and stronger than him) and then they started yelling again then later E was picked up by her parents and me and a friend went to the office to let them now what was happening then he got expelled. I have no idea what after math it caused for them but w is back and in ISS but E hasn't came back yet. I hate W and their parents so much but for some reason (and I hate to admit it) I feel bad for W because maybe he got into a lot of trouble at home... Idk I just feel bad I'm also really scared about E because she said she wanted to kill herself",

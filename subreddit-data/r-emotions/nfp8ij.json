    "postText": "Im a 19 year old guy who can barely show emotions. Happy is the only emotions i feel comfortable expressing. So everyone thinks im always happy even my parents. I never really cared about this and was generally always happy. Lately it has started to really bothering me though and became self conscious about it. Maybe i did repress my emotions by always being the happy kid. I've noticed that i cant build 'real' relationships with people this way. I cant even say 'bro' back to my closest friends. I have always been really shy, this has gotten better over the years and im more social now so thats good, but i still feel really uncomfortable talking about anything personal. I dont know why its so hard for me to talk about anything that involves emotions. I want to and sometimes i try but i get anxious and stop talking altoghether. It has gotten to the point where i feel like noone truly knows me. Since i cant talk about it with anyone i thought i would try it here. What makes it worse is that i dont see myself coming over this anytime soon. I had caring parent and a fun youth so i dont think its my childhood. Does anyone have the same experience And maybe some  ways i can overcome this?",

They are just signals originating from your values/vices, beliefs/opinions, expectations and patterns.\n\nYour body doesn't have any other way to signal/warn you.\n\nYou are totally free to feel your emotions and share them:\n\n\"I saw this happening and it made me feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nThen there's self-reflection, asking yourself why did it made you uncomfortable. There's always one of the above where the emotions are coming from.\n\nThe great thing is, when you do self-reflection, you will understand yourself better and then you can explain your emotions better to someone else.\n\n\"I saw this happening and it made me feel uncomfortable because (I believe) it's not right to treat sombody this way.\"\n\nEven this you can dig into more, why do you believe that it's not right to treat somebody this way? An answer could be because it hurst this person or shames this person.\n\nEmotions are always 'heavy', but really just see them as signals, nothing more, nothing less.",

The self reflection part is intresting because i kinda do realize why it is hard. The problem is that i dont really get why people 'like' me and this puts me in a 'self defense mode' (I think). So i have to work on my self confidence.",

You're making too much adrenaline and cortisol. Because they get sensitised all kinds of strange symptoms appear and one of the symptoms is that your emotions of fear/anxiety will be more present.\n\nThat again makes you stress and worry more, because you're more aware of your fear and anxiety.\n\nSo, first stop worrying about what people might think when you open up. Let your mind rest. Give you nerves time to recover. Don't worry about the feeling of anxiety.\n\nIn a couple of months (2 or 3) your nerves will be recovered.\n\n---\n\nThen after recovery it will be time to open up to people. \n\nThe first thing you're going to tell is, that you want to open up  but you felt/feel anxiety, because you've been showing only you happy-side. And you have thoughts about what they might think about you when you tell them you've got other emotions too.\n\nSo they know it's hard for you at the moment, they will understand. And they will reassure you that it's okay.\n\nPeople understand things can be hard, they have their own fears, worries and anxieties.\n\n---\n\nAnd keep in mind: Don't ever, ever fear your emotions. They are just signals from your values/beliefs/expectations. Your values/beliefs/expectations change over time, you'll grow, you'll become wiser.\n\nDo you understand what you need to do and why?",

But im trying not to care. The thought of having to say \"you want to open up but you felt/feel anxiety, because you've been showing only you happy-side\" is scary haha, but i hope i will reach this stage eventually.",

It's actually not about not caring, but not fearing.\n\nYou know what is great about Reddit, you first talk to strangers. I don't know you, but I know there's someone out there who's working on his confidence. Working on being proud to just show who he is.\n\nReally, once you tell, once you face the fears in your mind, you will be so enormous proud of yourself. It's the greatest feeling!\n\nYou'll realise your mind is playing tricks on you. Making you fear things to keep you safe. That's wisdom, seeing through those tricks. Your family and friends aren't lions or snakes for which your mind needs to keep you safe.\n\nIt's part of our reptilian brain, causing this all. But we don't live in the prehistoric age anymore... we don't need the fear. But stress in life causes more adrinaline then we need and all of a sudden our reptilian brain just connects normal things to danger.\n\nLet it sink in.\n\nAvoid making to much adrenaline... let your body rest and you'll be fine as long as you remind yourself that part of you is still prehistoric and that's where the fear come from.",

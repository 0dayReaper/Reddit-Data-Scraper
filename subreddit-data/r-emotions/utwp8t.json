    "postText": "This is my first reddit post and I was hoping some people would be able to give me an answer for what I\u2019m feeling and what causes it. It\u2019s not constantly but it\u2019s happened enough and wedged itself into my life so quickly it\u2019s an issue, I get so jealous? Annoyed? Sad? Over the smallest things like just early my boyfriend wasn\u2019t paying attention to me because he was playing games, it was fine at first because he got a new desk and he wanted to use it. Then his brother (they\u2019re twins) said in a groupchat that he was waiting on getting a monitor and that kinda made my heart drop a little and get a little heavy, it was worse when my boyfriend said he was also waiting for a monitor. My heart dropped so low and got so heavy, I wanted to cry and I don\u2019t know why, I didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d just play games and ignore me the entire time. I just felt frustrated but I didn\u2019t want to talk to him about it because it was so petty like I wanted to cry because he mentioned buying a monitor. It\u2019s not the first time this has happened over small things, I don\u2019t talk to him about it because they\u2019re so small and shouldn\u2019t be an actual issue but they affect me so much. I think it\u2019s my jealousy issues kicking it but I\u2019m not 100% sure. If anyone knows what causes this or what it\u2019s called or how to stop it that wouldn\u2019t be greatly appreciated.",

    "postText": "Cheating vs Lying\n\nIt hurts to be cheated on but it\u2019s never the actual cheating that gets me. It\u2019s the fact that I was lied to, I\u2019m not sure how to explain it but I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m always honest whether I want to be or not. And to be lied to feels like the most fucked up thing in the world. Even if it\u2019s a minor lie, it just hurts. Anybody know why?",

    "postText": "Hi, This is me writing to myself\u2026 It\u2019s been a hard week, hasn't it? Yeah, it has been, and yet I deeply want to keep moving just for me, not for anyone else. I know I\u2019ve done wrong in the past but it\u2019s finally time to let it go. It\u2019s time I stop drawing myself back into that hole, it\u2019s time I stop hurting myself for something that is not going to come back. I don\u2019t want to spend every day crying and mourning for something that was and isn't anymore. Life keeps going, life moves on, and I have to grab life's hand and move on with it. I sit here writing this, it makes me think, and it distracts me from my feelings. I was once everything, I felt amazing but now I truly know there can not be happiness without sadness. There can not be Love without hate. I don\u2019t hate her for what she did, but I hate myself that I let her stay in my life, and yet still today too. If it was truly love she would have never left in the first place we could've kept going right? Things I think to myself every day. I hurt myself by thinking, what if she was talking to another guy, texting him, similar like she texted me? What if she truly is tired of me and is trying to get rid of me in the nicest way? I get it, I hurt myself every day, I cry myself to sleep, I constantly think about her\u2026 I can say I've let her go, but when the day comes when I think about her and it doesn't hurt, when her face, her smile starts to fade then I can truly say I've moved on with life. I am so temporary and I hate feeling this way for a long time, but someone once told me to feel everything out, feel everything that life has to offer, even if it's painful or sad happiness everything. I want to experience life, I don\u2019t want to sit here and do nothing to stop moving because there was a special person in my life and now she is gone forever, but one day I also too will be gone forever. I want to go outside smell the flowers smell the outside world. I want to do something with my life I want to be someone that I would be proud of, and I want to Feel like I learned something, before my time is over. I want to grow knowing that I did my very best to show myself that I love myself. No more of those painful thought no more of the sad nights no more of that, please. I\u2019ve felt like I've suffered my whole life, No one has loved me for me. In school, people would say things but I was fine laughing it off, in any event, or sport I played I would get taught that there are people out there that are hurting too because they said hurtful things to me. But All I hope is that they too find that peace and happiness that they are looking for, I too hope they find that moment that is worth living for. because I know I am someone maybe to nobody but I'm someone to me. No matter where I go I will never look down at my feet and miss the world around me I know that I will look out into the world and reflect on it, the world too gets hurt, the tree the animal's everyone gets hurt but they keep moving the world keeps spinning the solar system keep moving everything keeps moving no matter how bad it was, no matter how much damage it took it too will keep moving and often I find myself dreaming and wishing I had that strength I too want to keep moving no matter how bad I fall. I just need time just like anything else in this world. Flowers whose leaves die and fall can still arise again with some time and care. Land burned with fire, will grow and flourishes better than ever with time... Maybe one day I might get knocked down so hard I don't want to keep going, I\u2019ve thought about it again and again, taking that gift I was given away, Ending the precious gift of life, just to end my suffering. How nice it would sound to just go to darkness forever, peace, and quiet not feeling sadness, anger, grief, sorrow, or depression, but at what cost? I will never be able to feel happy, joyful, smile, laugh, and hug, everything that was good in this world. I will never be able to see the people I love again, I will never be able to see the world as it is. I will never be able to meet new people with such wonderful stories, I will never be able to be something to myself I will never be able to be fulfilled, and happy with myself. I don\u2019t want that to go away not for me but for anyone, So please take care of yourself, even if you think nobody cares I care, I care for people that are forgotten or lost, I care we can all make it just to see that flower bloom again.",

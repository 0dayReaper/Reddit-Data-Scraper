    "postText": "Why do I get so upset or hurt by this 1 specific person? I love them to death and I know they feel the same, (not romantically) but the littlest things that they do can upset me or just ruin my mood for the rest of the day or night and I don\u2019t know why. If it were anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t care nearly as much. I hold them so close to my heart and I feel terrible when I get upset or angry over these stupid little things and take it out on them. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s this 1 specific person. Help.",

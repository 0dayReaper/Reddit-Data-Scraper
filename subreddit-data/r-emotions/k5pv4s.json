    "postText": "He had a major heart attack and I'm super conflicted about how to feel. A little back history: I'm the youngest of 13 (his/hers/ours). I'm 44/m and he was 65. I have several \"half-siblings\" but he's the only one who I just didn't consider my regular sibling. I can only remember one time in my life that he was ever nice to me. In all fairness, I didn't see him often except for some holidays and funerals. He spent 26 years in the Army and much of it was as a drill sergeant advd he simply could not turn it off. The last time I saw or spoke with him was at my mother's funeral almost 3 years ago and that was short advd terse. Most of my other sibs feel much the same way as myself. His oldest son is only a couple of years younger than me and there's no love lost there either. He has three other sons by wife #2 who are all mid to older teens. I feel almost relieved for them. He wasn't physically abusive but he was certainly emotionally so. He treated those kids like they were Army boot camp recruits and I'm not even exaggerating a little. I think if our mother was still living I would at least feel bad for her. As it stands, I have no intention of attending any kind of memorial or funeral services. I know at least 2 of my other sibs don't either. I'm fully convinced that my name will not appear in his obituary and I'm perfectly fine with that. I've lost 2 other siblings in my life, both of my parents and all but one uncle as well as a nephew, and certainly didn't feel this way at all. I won't miss him in the very least. I felt so much more emotional when I had to have my old dog put to sleep due to cancer last year. I know that sounds atrocious but it's true. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Obviously I feel some guilt for having no remorse whatsoever. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?",

    "postText": "Well, it's not about me, it's about a friend, Kenny, who's almost certain that he has Asperger's but he also thinks he MIGHT have another condition that affects his emotions and general emotional state. He's a 13-year-old boy in secondary school.\n\n# Asperger's\n\nThese are the symptoms of Asperger's he identifies with:\n\n* Liking having patterns and routines that don't change.\n* High integrity. Basically avoiding getting involved in drama or gossip, in a school context. Also being straightforward with what he thinks.\n* Not being socially-driven. Being more reserved and fuelled by motivations not relating to other people. Not caring about impressing them or stuff like that.\n* Being more logical/rational than impulsive and emotional.\n* Tends to be really persistent and resilient, like in his classwork.\n* Obsessed with little details. Paying attention to very insignificant things and being able to manage all that information.\n* Self-diagnosed (with prolific evidence) anxiety.\n* Having few interests.\n* Desire for sameness; heavily disliking and being uncomfortable with change; whether big or small.\n* Very distinctive strengths. He's incredible at mathematics, sciences and history, to the point where he finds work that the top-students in Year 11 do to be easy. We're in Year 8.\n* Remarkable focus and persistence.\n* Aptitude for pattern-recognition.\n* Hypersensitivities (to lights and sounds).\n* Uncoordinated movement and clumsiness.\n* Difficulty with both verbal and non-verbal communication. This includes both letting others know how he feels and perceiving what someone else feels.\n\nAfter some research, we came to the conclusion that he has Asperger's and he'll get it checked by a doctor sometime soon. That part's fine. However, he thinks that there COULD be another condition at play here. It's to do with how he manages emotions. \n\n# Uncertainty\n\nStraight from our conversation: (Bold = Me) (Regular = Kenny)\n\n**Could you describe how you perceive emotions?**\n\nI also find it hard to describe emotion so give me a moment. I'd say I have a complete control of my emotions to an above-average level, but certain things will set me off. I perceive emotion as a secondary thing until I get triggered for lack of better words. Or unless it's important to the situation. \n\n**So, what's the primary thing?**\n\nWell, there's different ones for certain emotions, for instance seeing friends get hurt intentionally makes me pissed, like hulk-rage-pissed. Things that make me sad are things I can personally identify with the vast majority of the time.\n\n**I think this is a possibility that this is actually a symptom of Asperger's. The characteristic that stands out as abnormal to me is the disparity between your regular emotional state and your intense, rare emotional outbursts.**\n\nyeah\n\n**so it could also be a different, lesser-known condition. I'll do some digging**\n\nI'll try too.\n\nThis could just be puberty combining with my Asperger's.\n\n**Could be.**\n\nI'm pretty certain now but I'll definitely be getting an official diagnosis.\n\nBut I may have another idea. It could be that I just have good control of emotions from experience because I am often in experiences where I hide emotion and my potential Asperger's triggers are different from others.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe're unsure. It could be exactly what we predicted or it could be something we'd never even considered. Based off this, is there any condition that seems to line up really well with this? Or is our theory most-likely to be true. We're just looking for input because of our lack of knowledge in this field. Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "I've got Aspergers too.\n\nThe thing is as people we are not explained what feelings and emotions are.\n\nBeing natural sensitive means fighting against feeling and by doing that we slowly build up stress. Took me 44 years and I got into a burn out.\n\nExplain this to him:\n\nWe got feelings that tell us about the status of our body:\n\n- Being tired\n- Feel hungry\n- Feel thirsty\n- Need to pee or poo\n- Feel warm or cold\n\nHe always, always has to listen to those feelings, never, ever discard these!!! Especially feeling tired. His nervous system need the rest, more then neurotypicals. The more rest, the less sensitive everything seems. Remind him to be aware very, very often!! \n\nThen we got emotions:\n\n- Emotions telling how he and other people are suppose to behave to each other.\n- Emotions of fear, because we think something is scary (but might be just imagination, or somebody told him) and somethings are actually a danger (knifes, snakes, tigers)\n- Emotions of anger/irritation, when something doesn't go as expected. (And I know, I always thought I knew exactly how it is suppose to be or where it should be, so I was quite an angry/irritated person. He should try to expect less and know he's not always right, though he knows much.)\n- Emotion of sadness, when something he's attached to breaks or is lost (Somehow I was more sad because of a thing then a human \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, that has changed over time.)\n- And some more emotions, but I guess you can explain more about them.\n\nFeelings/emotions are signals, that's all. They will fade if you ignore them/just let them be. We can't control the feeling of the emotion, it's triggered by our thoughts. We can control or thoughs! Mindfulness and meditations are good excercises.\n\nDo teach him to self-reflect: Why do I feel this emotion? What did I think, see or hear? Then he will understand where the emotions are coming from (values/opinions/beliefs/expectations) and will know himself better. The emotions won't be such a mystery. He won't be a mystery to himself.\n\nAnd if he likes reading: \"Great Thinkers\" from The School of Life has a lot of wisdom and explains a lot of emotions and the way we feel/act, I think he'll like that.\n\nI hope this helps, if you have any other questions ask.",

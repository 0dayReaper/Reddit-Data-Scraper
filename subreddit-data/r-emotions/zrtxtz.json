    "postText": "Lately I've been looking into ways of lowering my anxiety level as well as how to develop greater mental fortitude and it turns out that both require mindfulness. The thing is that that's a bit of a problem for me because I absolutely hate my emotions (at least the negative ones). I started out in life as an overly sensitive person and that absolutely ruined my life. As an adult I feel like the thing that has helped me most in life and made it possible for me to get by both at work and in my relationships was learning how to ignore my emotions and not act on them. The number of times in which I ended up being grateful for not acting on an emotional impulse far, far, far outnumber the times in which I was sorry for not saying or doing something in the heat of the moment. On rare occasions my emotions still manage to get the better of me and when that happens I feel out of control and helpless to stop my own brain and afterwards I'm left feeling defeated and ashamed of myself. If it were up to me I'd rather not feel anything at all, however it seems that that approach actually makes it a lot harder for me to make any changes in my life because that causes my anxiety to become unmanageable (and then I'm not able to manage it without practicing mindfulness). Does anyone have any advice on how to solve this conundrum?",

It triggers tingles and aches and tensions in specific places which either feel nice or uncomfortable. And this is the difference between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019. That\u2019s it.  \n\nThe liver sits under our rib cage in the first soft spot just under the middle of the ribs is where we feel both anxiety and happy butterflies. Both feelings of anticipation but one good, one bad.    \n  \nPeople who drink too much and get \u2018hangxiety\u2019 next day as part of their hangover, feel that way because their liver is hurting.   \nLiterally the emotion of anxiety as a result of burdening the liver with too much alcohol.\n\nYou can massage that spot round and round and this will help it relax.",

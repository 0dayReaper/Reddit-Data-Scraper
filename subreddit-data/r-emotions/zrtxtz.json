It triggers tingles and aches and tensions in specific places which either feel nice or uncomfortable. And this is the difference between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019. That\u2019s it.  \n\nThe liver sits under our rib cage in the first soft spot just under the middle of the ribs is where we feel both anxiety and happy butterflies. Both feelings of anticipation but one good, one bad.    \n  \nPeople who drink too much and get \u2018hangxiety\u2019 next day as part of their hangover, feel that way because their liver is hurting.   \nLiterally the emotion of anxiety as a result of burdening the liver with too much alcohol.\n\nYou can massage that spot round and round and this will help it relax.",

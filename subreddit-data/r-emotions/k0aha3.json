Say you feel a full range of emotions but can't think past material problem solving. Chimpanzees, based on what we know, are the same, so does that make you a human or a chimpanzee? Now, say you cannot feel emotion but think about the big questions, like how we should live our lives or what makes life worth living. What are you then? By process of elimination, you can only be one thing: human.",

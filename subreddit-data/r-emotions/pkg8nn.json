    "postText": "So I just cant, my base happines is higher than most people for what ive noticed but the variations of happines and sadness are way less pronounced too, Im stable to the extreme, but once every 2-3 months I feel sad for a day or 2 nothing crazy but definitely abover average sadness for me, my eyes water and I feel pressure around my eyes. I dont think Im a psychopath because I cried when my dog and ehen my grandpa died but the sadness vanished in a few hours on the dog case and in days on my grandpa case, when I think about my father dying the first thing that comes to my mind is how we are going to provide for ourselves without his money, the fact that the first thing that comes to my mind is not about losing him I feel a bit sad, I know Ill miss him ita just not the first thing that will come to my mind, I love my brothers and mom and dad but I just cant look at the as siblings and mom and dad and not think about them as just people first, its weird ai feel stuff but it just looks like my priorities are twisted in some way or its not as powerful as I tjink it should for a normal person.  \nAlso when I gonaway from city from city I just disconnect from people totally and I have no idea why, never felt the urge to call someone after I moved or went away to some place, Ill at most just look at their instragrams for the sakr of beeing curious and remember the times I was with those people.",

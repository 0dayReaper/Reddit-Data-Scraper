    "postText": "I'm a 14 year old and whenever anxiety was piling up on me I used to able to turn on sad music and let out the emotions piling up on me and it was extremely therapeutic.\n\nNow there's been a lot I've been bottling up now and I can't even let out more than two tears, where my anxiety has started getting to its peak due to some other issues. I feel like it has to do with scenarios I've been having where I catch myself wanting to cry in environments I can't, so I just held it in and never let it out.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this issue? I really need help with this and any solution given is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Crying happens as a release, and most of our major muscle groups relax to allow crying to happen. Trying to force yourself to cry often engages muscle groups that prevent crying from happening. This is a very common challenge for actors that try to force themselves to cry.  \n\n\nAnother thought. Crying is biologically a reaction to sadness. Anxiety is not necessarily the same as sadness, so crying might not be the right solution for when you're anxious even though it has worked in the past.   \n\n\nI highly recommend that you try a regular practice of meditation. Try it for a few minutes a day when you're already calm. It's a discipline that takes practice, so if you try to employ it only when you're already upset, you'll probably find it doesn't help.",

            "comment": "Crying is a release of built up stress chemicals, and a signal to caring, empathetic humans to offer comfort. It\u2019s also, unfortunately a signal to unkind, uncaring humans of weakness and vulnerability which they can take as an opportunity to attack. \nHolding in tears for fear of ridicule can become a habit, and often then finds eventual release in anger. This is damaging for both the sufferer and those close to them. \n14 is a difficult time. A lot of pressures and expectations to deal with, and frankly not a lot of useful advice on offer either at school or perhaps at home. Ideally you would have someone you can trust yourself to be vulnerable with and cry in front of without fear of attack or dismissal. If not, you may have to work out a realistic plan to deal with the situation that is causing you most stress. \nIf you\u2019re a reader, I can suggest two books which might help you understand the human condition better. \u2018The eternal child\u2019 by Clive Bromhall, and The road less travelled\u2019 by Scott Peck. \nIn the meantime, be aware that our emotions are created by our Solar Plexus, which is \u2018the abdominal brain\u2019 and has tendrils connected to our internal organs amongst other things. It receives signals from the brain and literally causes muscle contractions and nerve impulses which we interpret as our \u2018feelings\u2019. You can calm it down with self massage and breathing techniques, which you\u2019ll find online. Also, remember to drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep, and take B vitamins. Molasses is a good source.\nHope that helps a bit. Big hug.",

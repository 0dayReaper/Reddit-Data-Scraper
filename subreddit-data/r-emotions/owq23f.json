It takes a couple of days to lower the excess adrenalin and let my nervous system heal. (Stress = stressing our nervous system with excess adrenalin.)\n\nI'm in love, being in love stresses too, sometimes when I'm with my gf, the feelings are so overwhelming that I stop feeling emotions. That kind of sucks. Knowing you want to be with her but being overwhelmed.",

Sounds like emotional depression (physical depression is described as a black hole).\n\nHave you talked to a therapist?\n\nI'm just a person with my own experiences and when I felt empty I looked up some websites about how to feel happy again. And tried different things mentioned. I started volenteer work, that helped me get rid of the emptiness. Now I find happiness in a hobby (growing shrooms).\n\nHope you find the things that fill up the emptiness you feel, get to know yourself again and what things you love to do now (you're not the same person anymore as 20 years ago, so your interests might have changed).",

I heard a probably 5 second or so clip from the song For the First Time by Mac Demarco, it made me feel a weird emotion. I have no memories attached to this song this was the first time i've heard it. It nearly made me cry, I got chills and my eyes started to water. I'm not a very emotional person, I don't cry very often which is why I'm so curious about why I almost started bawling from a song I have no memory of. I kinda froze when I heard it, it was like everything around me wasn't there for those few seconds I listened, it's an odd feeling. I don't really know if I came hear to rant or to find answers. Any replies of any kind would be appreciated.",

I also felt that I was alive for events that happened before I was born and had been to places I had never been to before. I just felt like I was in  completely made up places, but my brain made it feel so real. I got the feeling first time I heard a couple years ago and still get it every time I listen to it. As soon as the song starts the feeling comes back immediately. I posted it in the sub for the bad that made it, but I didn't get any help. The song is called Good Grief by Foo Fighters if you wanna check it out. Other people say they get feelings similar to mine when they listen to it.",

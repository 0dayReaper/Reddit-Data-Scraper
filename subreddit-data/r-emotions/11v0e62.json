    "postText": "I had a job I loved, but due to sexual harassment from staff &amp; being upskirted by a client. It's a long story but when it was investigated he turned out to be a hardened criminal. For my own safety I was moved to a 'safer' branch. I was then mini stalked by another client. I left the company. I got my dream job &amp; thought I had made some nice friends there. A few weeks ago I was told by a colleague that a male colleague, who I thought was just someone we all had banter with, told people that I had shown him nudes! I did no such thing. He also said that he could have me any time he wanted. I told management who have suspended him due to other lies that have surfaced ad well. I was walking to work last week, looked up &amp; a man was standing in from of me playing with his willy! The next day on the way to work I got a message from a girl who found me online to tell me that my long term boyfriend, who I love very much, had been snogging her at a club. He admitted it when I confronted him. We were inseparable &amp; had been looking at flats together. He used to tell me how much he loved me &amp; I was the perfect woman for him. I'm done. I don't know how to cope with all of this - it's too much, my head's about ready to explode!!",

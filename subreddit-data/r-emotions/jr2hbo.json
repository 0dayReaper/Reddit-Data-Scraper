I\u2019m quite new to Reddit but was hoping for some insight from people who might understand what I\u2019m dealing with.\n\nI care very deeply for others, and even more deeply for my loved ones. I\u2019m very empathetic to the point where it\u2019s overwhelming for me at times. I feel as if I am not in control of my emotions. I pick up on how people are feeling quite easily, and if I\u2019m around them for an extended period of time or have a close relationship with said person, I will start to feel their emotions. I pick up on their energy and it severely affects mine\u2014 whether it be good or bad. Tears are quite easy for me as well. I cry over anything and everything. I can\u2019t help it and I don\u2019t know how to stop it. I\u2019ve talked to my therapist about this, who just referred to it as me being highly sensitive with insecure boundaries. I don\u2019t disagree with her, but is there something more to this? Surely this isn\u2019t a normal thing for all sensitive people. Many family members and friends of mine are quite sensitive, but not to this extent. Has anyone else dealt with this? Thanks in advance to all. \ud83e\udd0d",

I recommend a channel called Psych2Go where you can find videos on the HSP, and they really do help a lot.",

            "comment": "I hear you! \n\nAs a therapist, I understand that being a highly sensitive and empathetic person can be personally exhausting. Do not worry, it's completely normal, a lot of people experience this!\n\nAll of us, even if we are generally sensitive feel things at different intensities and react accordingly. Here are a few tips that I hope can help you cope better with your own emotions and reactions:\n\n1. **Know your triggers.** While it sometimes seems like everything is intense and overwhelming, becoming more aware of what exactly impacts us is important. Shift attention inwards. Try to answer these questions for yourself: what happened? what was my first thought? how did I feel? how did I respond? This can help you understand what situations are too overwhelming for you and help you be better prepared next time!\n2. **Create a \"relaxing zone\" for yourself.** You need down-time. A space where all you do is spend time with yourself, maybe listen to some soothing music, meditate, journal. Make sure you don't do any work or talk to anyone about their concerns in this space. It's only meant for relaxation!\n3. **Practice self-care!** Make sure you're eating well, sleeping enough and getting physical activity. Taking care of yourself is extremely important!\n\nHere's a great article on the same: [https://medium.com/swlh/the-highly-sensitive-person-hsp-s-survival-guide-in-an-overstimulating-world-ab7361e8b86b](https://medium.com/swlh/the-highly-sensitive-person-hsp-s-survival-guide-in-an-overstimulating-world-ab7361e8b86b)\n\nHope this helps!

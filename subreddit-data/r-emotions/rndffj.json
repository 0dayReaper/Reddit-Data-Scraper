            "comment": "First off, not sure, I think it varies from person to person. Could be the anti depressants (\u2018emotional blunting\u2019), or possibly learned behaviour from childhood. Put simplistically, crying serves two key functions, to flush out stress chemicals not needed for flight or fight, and to signal to other caring members of our family/group that we may need comforting, an essential part of natural human social behaviour.  \nIf the anti depressants are suppressing the release of those stress chemicals in the body it won\u2019t trigger crying to flush them out, and some children are teased for crying in their family so they learn to suppress it.",

She has lost grandparents, gone through her dad and I divorcing, break-ups, etc.  still no tears. We discovered she is autistic. We are wondering if that is why. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are weird. I think you have just blocked a lot of things. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some point in your life if someone told you it\u2019s not ok to cry.  Even made you feel bad for crying. I find what you are feeling very valid and ok.",

            "comment": "Is it the same with emotional or physical pain?\n\nI do have a question that's in my mind about the meds. We get negative emotions when we don't fill our needs and when expectations are not met.\n\nI have noticed myself when I don't fill in certain needs I get depressed... like really, really sad for example and I can't get rid of the feeling for days, weeks. Like not loving myself enough or not feeling confident makes me sad. (Thoughts make me sad too, but when I don't think of the sad thought, the emotion disappears.)\n\nI feel that I need something to feel better, then I take action. I make a plan/strategy to fill in the need. And... it actually takes just a day to get rid of the nasty emotion. For me it went away when I realised I could fill in all my needs if I take action. I can make the choice (that's a need to).\n\nHow are you to fill your needs if you don't feel them? How do you find what makes you tick or what you dislike? How do you get out of a depression when you don't feel what unfilled needs are giving you depression? How do you navigate through life without a compass of needs?",

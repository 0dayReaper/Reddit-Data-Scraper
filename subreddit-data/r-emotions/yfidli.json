    "postText": "Apologies if that's a weird title, I can't think of how best to word my question in a short manner.\n\nI just need help understanding why I care more about the Robot/AI characters in a show/book/movie/game than I do the human characters, even when the humans are the protagonists? A human character could die and I wouldn't really think twice about it, but the idea of a robot character dying makes me really emotional and upset. \n\nThis emotional response does not make sense to me, surely as a human seeing a fictional human die should make me sad? Why would I be getting more emotionally attached to the AIs and be incapable of emotional attachment to human characters? Insight would be most appreciated.",

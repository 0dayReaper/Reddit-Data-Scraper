When I think about how I\u2019m feeling it seems like I feel absolutely nothing, and yet I know that I\u2019m sad. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a better way to describe this, but I\u2019m hoping it makes sense! I don\u2019t know what this means or if it\u2019s something that everyone feels, so any input is welcomed.",

    "postText": "I know I can be someone positive and disciplined and being able to speak my feelings to my friends and maybe find a way to heal. But the truth is I'm always thinking I'm a piece of trash and I always obstruct my exits and simply laugh at my attempts to be a better person. I'm sick of being me, sometimes I'm even sick of my friends and family. Reality just makes me wanna dig a hole to be there forever because I don't see the point in anything.",

            "comment": "I found myself on the same path 3 months ago but came to realize it\u2019s never about proving a point to anyone. The path I have turned to is observing. That means exactly what it sounds like. \n\nI believe our actual full awake conscious is dog shit at connecting ideas, thoughts, and beliefs. This job is taken by our powerful subconscious. So when you try telling your sister she is lousy because she never cleans up her dishes is just ur consciousness trying to make sense of life when your subconscious is really at work trying to connect the dots. In other words, it\u2019s undesired tension. \n\nSo with what I have leaned so far in my journey is to allow my body to move and talk freely without me consciously ever trying to object it.\n\nI know this sounds fucking far fetched. But it is as easy as eating a cookie...I am not kidding. Once you get it, you get it. The song \u2018Put Your Records On\u2019 by Corinne Bailey Rae hits this point perfectly. \n\nYou are on the right track if you start experiencing things you have not felt in a long time such as love or friendship or kindness, same is said for hate, despair, and grief. These emotions are all apart of the journey and your subconscious logically makes sense of each and every one of them without your awake conscious even knowing. \n\nIf you reach the point at my at and start to wonder what is this strange force guiding me through this adventure called life? ... I believe it\u2019s the human force, universe, chi, whatever name you would like to call it. I believe this is the force destined to take us to higher potentials in life than we ever imagined. And all this happens by simply allowing the process to happen...that easy. \n\nMy key take aways from my journey.\n1. Everything happens for a reason \n2. Have patience\n3. The more of an observer you can be, the more you become who you truly want to be. \n\nBest of luck my friend. You create the own meaning in your life.",

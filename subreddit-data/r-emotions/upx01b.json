You cared enough to get a towel and move it, and now you\u2019re worrying about your reaction so you\u2019re not a psychopath!  \nI look after several street cats and care about them very much, but when a different cat ran straight under my car wheels at night, with another car close behind me and no time to stop, I just had to accept that the cat was dead and there was nothing I could do about it.   \nI turned around and went back to make sure it really was dead and not suffering but I didn\u2019t cry about it or feel particularly guilty. It was a shame for the cat and sad for the owner, if it had one, but just one of those things.",

There was a squirrel that ran in front of my car as I was entering a freeway. I knew I hit him and felt very bad. In my head, I was mad at the squirrel for being an idiot and why did he have to do that and that I had to grieve a little. I didnt cry, but felt very horrible for that squirrel. I couldn't revive him. What's really important is that you gotta know that you dont have to cry to show that you care or have emotions. You took the initiative to grab a towel and grab him to the side.",

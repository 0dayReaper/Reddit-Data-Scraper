    "postText": "Hello! I applied for the Spring as a transfer student. So far I've heard back from all the schools I  applied at besides Fresno. I applied as a Construction Management major, however I was expecting to hear from them first considering my CC is considered local Fresno. Has anyone heard back or does anyone have an idea of when I can expect a reply?",

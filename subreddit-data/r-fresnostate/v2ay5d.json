            "comment": "Fresno State is a commuter school, meaning the majority of students live off campus. However, I\u2019ve never run out of people to meet, including many people who live in the dorms or Greek houses. It\u2019s very possible to have an American college experience at Fresno State. I\u2019d suggest joining Greek life to get invited to the good parties, events, etc. I\u2019m not involved in Greek life but have several friends who are. I\u2019m not too sure about sex life, this is actually my first year at Fresno state as a legal adult (I skipped two grades) and I didn\u2019t dare try anything underage that might make my parents sus cuz I\u2019m an annoying goody two shoes \ud83d\udc80Anyway hope this was semi helpful",

            "comment": "As others have stated it is mostly a commuter school however there is a lot of people who live on off campus student housing (I did I\u2019m not from Fresno). I would say based on knowing people from ASU they do have more of a party life college experience. Though as FS you can still have that experience by joining Greek life or knowing people in Greek life, and I would also try to get to know athletes (they tend to also have parties at their athletes houses) my first year at college before Covid I use to go to parties a lot, but now that I just recently graduated my last year there I mostly found my people through my major and my club and did less parties but more get together stuff and events. As for your second question\u2026 I dont have an answer for that bc I\u2019ve been in a relationship throughout college. Though I\u2019m sure it pretty much similar to like every other college.",

I know some people really felt like they had that experience. That said, a school like ASU is more likely to give it to  you than Fresno State. It was about 20-25k students, the vast majority of which are commuters.",

I thought it was going to be easy and I was shook. From what I remember we made a lot of puppets and he loves it when you put effort into it. He\u2019s not a tough grader either. Just make sure you \u201ctry\u201d and you\u2019ll be fine. We had a few discussion boards too. And a final where we teach how to make a puppet to a class. I think that was the only difficult thing we had to do. I\u2019d recommend him if he\u2019s still teaching that class. Goodluck!",

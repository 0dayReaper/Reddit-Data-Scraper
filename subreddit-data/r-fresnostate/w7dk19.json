Which one is better, in terms of pricing and range of products available? Also, are they both affiliated with the college? Or is it only one/none?\n\nThanks!",

There's the Kennel Bookstore, The Bulldog Shop, and Kennel Marketplace that sell school merchandise. Pricing is going to be relatively the same at all if them. I haven't been to Fanzone, but I'd assume similar pricing.",

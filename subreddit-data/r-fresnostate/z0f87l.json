I\u2019m so happy we both turned our seasons around and made it to the championship. Have fun torching Wyoming through the air next week! Don\u2019t sleep on Titus Swen, that dude is the real deal. Please keep Jake Haener healthy. I want to see both teams at 100%. See you in 2 weeks, my Bulldog Bros!",

I was rooting for Boise against Wyoming last night before our game, because I want to see a rematch between us; but this time, with our offensive captain, Jake Haener, and our defensive captain, Evan Williams, both back in the lineup and healthy. \n\nShould be a great game, man.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! My brother was supposed to move to Fresno this week and unfortunately his housing as not been confirmed yet. We aren\u2019t from the states, let alone the west coast! It will be really nice if someone living near CSU, Fresno can help out with a few recommendations about apartments, websites which can be helpful in finding one, brokers etc. He\u2019s looking for a place  close to  his university campus. Thanks!",

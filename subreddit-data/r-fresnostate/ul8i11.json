Do you recommend apply to UC Merced instead of Fresno State? How is the CS department at FS now? I know there was many topic about it but it was 2 years ago. Many thanks.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend you looking elsewhere if you want a good CS education. There are a lot of nice people and smart individuals that are generally poor educators and communicators. It's sad to say, but nothing has changed since the reddit posts from 2015 regarding staffing problems. The department is so woefully understaffed they need to make a list of people in order to manually place people into classes to help everyone graduate on time. Many  listed electives are non-existent unicorns seen once in a decade, and many core classes need to be planned around because there isn't enough staff to teach them year round. The department is trying hard though because they taught some core classes over summer this year to help people meet graduation requirements. I never had an internship in the area, but did travel to Arizona for a summer internship.",

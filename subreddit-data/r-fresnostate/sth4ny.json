    "postText": "I wasn\u2019t failing any classes and did well in passing all my classes, the only reason why I needed a dean to sign off on my major change application is because I exceeded the 144 units for the classes I have taken before changing my majors. I find it stupid that I need a dean to sign off for me to change my major. I did well in my classes and passed yet I\u2019m denied to change majors just because i exceed more than 144 units which I don\u2019t get why it would even have to be a thing for a dean to sign off. This is my first time ever to change majors and most college student change majors all the time but I don\u2019t get why they won\u2019t let me change for the sake of my own educational satisfaction \n\nEdit: it was NOT the dean who denied my application it was the department the chair/program coordinator who denied my application thus my application never went to the dean.",

It could be as simple as an administrative issue, perhaps not. You will never know by complaining to strangers on reddit. \n\nFeel free to vent of course, but if you have questions, I think you know who is capable of giving you answers.",

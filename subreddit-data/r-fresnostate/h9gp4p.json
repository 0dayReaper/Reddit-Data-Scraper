    "postText": "Hello guys! Since the middle of last year, I\u2019ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I\u2019ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU down in Florida, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problem exists in most commuter universities, but the problems differ depending on how the schools handle their parking operations.\n\nA group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and we are committed to solving the problem by designing a solution focusing on the students, and not on the parking lot administrator. So, to help us build a better solution for the students, we are asking help from students at various universities to answer a few questions about their experience when commuting and parking on campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.\n\n**It is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you 1 minute!**\n\n**Thank you!**\n\nHere is the link to answer the questions: [**University Parking | Student &amp; Staff Interview**](https://forms.gle/bUhpcsMJquwJiD8b8)\n\nCheck out our website to learn more about our project: [**Spott Parking**](https://www.spottparking.com/)",

But my classes were always at around 8 am and around noon in Engineering East and sometimes I could get a bit difficult. Unless I plan to park near 7/11 and save myself the hassle",

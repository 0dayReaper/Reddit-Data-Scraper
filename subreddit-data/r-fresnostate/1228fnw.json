            "comment": "Its a good school. Of course depending on your major it could be better or worse for you. Student life was great for me. A lot of good times. Football games. The city itself is whatever but honestly the best thing about the city was Fresno state. I did not know how good student life and the people were until I transferred to a different school where majority keep to themselves and seem stuck up. I know people that have made done big things after Fresno state and also done nothing with their degree so theres that as well. People from all over the state attend fresno state so its cool meeting people from around CA. Whereas im at a smaller school and its mostly people from the county that the school is in",

The art department are making good changes and professors are great there. \n\nFresno state / Central Valley are very for helping their own so if you wanted to stay in Fresno after it is easier to get a job. However if you plan to move somewhere else just get a head start in internships, jobs, and networking. \n\nThe school is diverse. And student life is decent. Most of my friends were from my major and the club I was in.",

            "comment": "You get a lot of Central Valley students ( Modesto, Turlock , Merced , Fresno , Visalia, Bakersfield , Clovis basically the cities along the 99 highway) and students from the coast (salinas). You get an even smaller proportion from the big cities like the Bay Area , LA, San Diego etc I imagine they rather attend the local universities there. The even smaller proportion is from out of state/country where they thought it was a good idea to pick a campus right in the middle of California without knowing it\u2019s geography. If anything during my time I really enjoyed the Greek life there I was in a social fraternity and it was diverse and some not so diverse so you will find your social group  that aligns to your interest and hobbies.",

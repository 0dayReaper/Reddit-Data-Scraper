The library lends out a lot of different types of equipment, including noise cancelling headphones, camera equipment, apple pencils, calculators, projectors, and even 3D printers.\n\nHere's a link to the Tech Lending page of the library:  [https://library.fresnostate.edu/tech/tech-lending](https://library.fresnostate.edu/tech/tech-lending) \n\nIf they're out of stock of anything, they can put you on the waiting list.",

            "comment": "I lived on campus all four years and walked back from night classes frequently. I never felt unsafe, but I always carried pepper spray and walked with someone else if possible. During the day there are many people around and I never felt uncomfortable. I do recommend staying off your phone at night when walking around and paying attention to your surroundings. Also, at night you can call campus PD to escort you to your car.",

            "comment": "Agree with the other comments. I attended Fresno state for both my undergraduate and graduate work - total of 7.5 years and the worst that ever happened was a stolen bike because my friend who borrowed it for the day forgot to lock it. \n  \nI\u2019m a woman and have always been very aware of my surroundings for safety reasons. I stayed on the lit pathways, knew where the nearest blue button (calls the campus PD for you) was, and didn\u2019t walk around on my phone. I also tried not to walk alone, but by the time I was in grad school I felt pretty safe and would walk alone more often. \n  \nHonestly, the crime in Fresno is not as bad as people make it out to be. Just people complaining about stuff. There\u2019s crime in any big city. The campus PD are pretty great at their job compared to the city police. If you\u2019re anywhere near campus and need them (one time I was at the Starbucks across the street and a man came in to start shit, throwing their signs and snacks.. he was probably on something.. they had called the city police and no one showed for almost 30 min. I called campus PD and they arrived in two.) call them instead of city police/911. \n  \nFresno City college is in a worse part of town so you may hear about more crimes there. Fresno State is in a better part and is generally pretty quiet.",

The most a saw were stolen bike posters and sometimes shady people around the edge of campus.\nBe sure to have some sort of handy self defense item. Hopefully you never have to use it, but just in case.\nI have no idea about what the crime is like off of campus. Just be smart about where you are, at what time, and what you're doing.",

It isn\u2019t as bad as people might say, but there is some crime in the area nearby campus (in my experience, the more south and west you get from school, the worse).",

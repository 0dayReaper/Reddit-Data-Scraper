I will try to get ahold of him to see if he can post something about it. \n\nEDIT: Also, I've brought up the issue with the chipmunk costume before, it was a donation so not a single dime was invested into it. I think the person in the suit may even be a volunteer(s). Just a slight correction to your post. \n\nEDIT2: In case he doesn't post, [here's something he posted on his blog.](http://blog.reconciliationecology.org/2012/05/deforestation-of-urban-ecosystem-and.html)  Makes for a good read. [Welty responded to his letter too.](http://blog.reconciliationecology.org/2012/05/deforestation-of-urban-ecosystem-draft.html)\n\nEDIT3: I've updated the side bar to include a blogpost by Dr. Katti (leafwarbler) related to the issue. \n",

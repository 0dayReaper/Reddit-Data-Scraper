I expect a lot of hate on this one, but I have been in plenty of classes and know plenty of people that have/continue to cheat their way through. They get to senior year and know nothing about the basics. I say this as an engineering major myself. The department has begun to get some backlash lately, which is good because plenty of things slide. For examples, students from a certain foreign country get caught cheating and guess what, school dismisses it because that is where the money is. Or professors hosted classes during a mandated order not to due to covid-19, many got away with this and other departments were pissed because it puts the entire schools funding on the line.\n\nMy question to all you fellow Fresno State redditors, especially those in other majors, how do you feel knowing that a good chunk of these fellow students are cheating their way through engineering and are going to make more money than you with likely less effort put into their major? If you happen to be a fellow engineer, comment about cheating that you have seen taking place. I like my school, but we need to address the problems. Happy 4th of July everyone, stay safe out there!",

            "comment": "You're absolutely right. I graduated 2 yrs ago and while I was there there was lots of scandals regarding cheating by international students. And they would get away with it even if they were caught the worst thing that would happen would be maybe getting a 0 on that test, I don't think anyone completely failed the class after being caught or got kicked out of the school because of it. Its frustrating due to when working with some of them on important projects you found out they didn't know shit so you have to take care of the important work and just have them do the busy work. Obviously not all internationals did this but alot of them did and everyone knew about it but did nothing. Sadly it's not just a Fresno State issue. I've heard of this kind of thing from ppl attending engineering schools all around the US. But like you said money is the reason why they can get away with it sadly. Honestly the school/department should follow it's own rules and get rid of them.",

I reported to the department head when I first started there, and after they \u201cinvestigated\u201d they told me there\u2019s nothing they can do. In another class a classmate told the teacher that cheating was occurring and teacher said that it was on the student for cheating but they were not concerned. So... professors and deans know it happens and do not care. It does upset me because it changes the curve in my hard science/ math classes, but I have come to the conclusion there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. This is the new norm now.",

All they got was incompletes. They were all international too. It kinds sucks because i got poor grades in that class and barely passed while these 'adults who should know better' get a second chance. with almost no consequences",

            "comment": "Yeah, no one really cares. There's a lot of cheating going on in my department (stem). Mostly masked as asking for help in questions for take home exams. Especially now that exams were online or we had a few days to finish them.\n\nI had a student ask me to explain my homework solutions to them. They were smart, but such a procrastinator. They got an A in the course and I got a C. They were a Dean's medalist and summa cum laude. That semester I learned that no one is that department is really a friend, just leeches that use others to get ahead. \n\nI also saw cheating going on in statistics. Out of all damn classes lol. The professor allowed us cheat cards during exams. One student was writing solutions on the cover of their calculator. Another student literally took out a piece of paper from their backpack to look at the solution. Another student was using their phone for the answers.\n\nAnother one I heard of was cheating in one upper division math course, where the whole class heard the phone go off and nothing happened. Not during the exam nor after the exam.\n\nOnly once one new professor did something about cheating. We had a take home final exam (it was pretty hard), and although a lot of students got help from each other, there were three students who just asked for the answers and wrote the exact same thing. They got an IC and each met with the professor and head of department to explain their solutions and reason why each had the exact same answer. They ended getting away with it, but the professor took action. \n\nLike OP mentioned, it sucks that a lot of these stem cheaters will make more than others, but I hope the university starts taking more action towards these students.",

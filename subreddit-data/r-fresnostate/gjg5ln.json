    "postText": "Anyone else have professors that are giving them way less time that the usual 2 hours for exam time? \n\nTook one of my exams and my professor gave us 60 minutes, although they said that they would give us 90. When I wasn\u2019t able to complete it in time I brought it up with them and they reset it for me but then said it shouldn\u2019t have taken more than 60 minutes. \n\nKind of messed up given that we usually have up to two hours. It\u2019s just that my anxiety and other things got the best of me under pressure.",

I took my philosophy exam once into my professors next class.... I was embarrassed and felt rushed but I have accommodations. \n\nI would say it\u2019s fair for everyone to get more time on exams due to the current environment. It\u2019s a bummer some instructors are like that. All of mine have been great! My Phil is giving me time and my Crim teacher gave us 24 hours. So not all bad!",

And I would write a letter to the dean of the department to show your disapproval. It\u2019s not fair. We\u2019ve all had to adjust to the new rules and ways of learning. It\u2019s not a one size fits all. Just because some students excel in this environment doesn\u2019t mean all will. :( I hope you\u2019re doing good though. It\u2019s tough but at least it\u2019s the end for now!",

I would email the chair department and let them know. Also, save the email/screenshot where the prof tells you the time limit.\n\nThe professor is there to teach and help you pass the class, not fail you because of their incompetence.",

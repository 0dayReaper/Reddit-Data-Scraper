In my opinion, if you're not close or local to Fresno State, or have friends/family already in the area I don't recommend going. I'm not a Computer Science major, but I am in the College of Science and Mathematics, and it's okay. There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't really much to get excited over either.",

Computer Science majors would probably make more than that and eventually be making 6 figures. Its fun studying if you like what you're learning and you have friends. But not much partying unless you're really smart.",

After my EE undergrad and hearing what other EEs experienced in different universities I realized how lackluster the program here is. That being said I've heard great things about the Civil/MechE programs as well. \n\nIf ya have any questions feel free to PM!",

    "postText": "Do you like Fresno State?\n\nDo you like meaningless reddit competitions?\n\nAre you capable of clicking a button once a day?\n\nIf you answered yes to all of those questions, then join us at [r/CollegeFootballRisk](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/) and help them survive in a completely arbitrary game of Risk based on a map of US colleges!\n\nThe idea is simple---go to [www.collegefootballrisk.com](http://www.collegefootballrisk.com/) once a day, and select to attack or defend a territory for your team. That's it. 1 person = 1 vote. The more votes, the higher chance you win the territory. Lose all your territories, and you're out! Game is free to play and ran through reddit, basically a popularity contest with a bit of strategy.\n\nInvite your friends! Invite strangers! Post anywhere and everywhere. Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, old Groupchats you'd forgotten about, Craigslist, eHarmony, Tinder, text your ex, email your dad, message your DnD group, build it in Minecraft",

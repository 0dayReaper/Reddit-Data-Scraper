    "postText": "[EDIT] So, I've been thinking that maybe its about time that we formally make a group on campus.  Redditors often share a sense of humor and a sociable presence that makes them fun to be around.  Additionally, there is an endless treasure trove of inside jokes that actually are relatable to people.  My thoughts were that we should get together to party, watch movies, go to the bar (if your of age), and/or possibly do some campus political advocacy together.  Let's have a discussion!\nLink to Facebook Group: http://www.facebook.com/groups/287856821313557/",

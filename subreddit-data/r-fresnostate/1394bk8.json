    "postText": "hello!! im a highschool junior from out of state, and i\u2019ve had my eye on this school for a while now! i have a couple of questions before going through and applying to here. \n\ni want to go through the criminology, psychology, or business programs thats they offer, and i was wondering how well off those programs were? would it be worth it to take one of these courses here compared to another college?\n\nwhat about housing and dorm life? how expensive is it to live there and is it available to all students?\n\nand overall, what are some pros and cons that you have about going to school here? i would absolutely love to attend here, but i just need a bit more info :))\n\nthank you! :)",

But I believe the dorms are cheaper than other schools along with that it\u2019s easy to make friends if you just reach out to people ! I did that and I made a couple of friends for each semester. I would say some cons are that if you don\u2019t reach out to others it does get a bit lonely &amp; there\u2019s not much on campus it\u2019s fairly small !",

You just have to reach out and connect with professors especially if you want to do research. There's lots of support and programs for psych majors that prepares them for grad school and work. Lemme know if you have any questions! I'm a senior and heading into their masters program the upcoming fall!",

            "comment": "Im speaking as an alumni whose enjoyed all the social facets of this college who no longer lives in the area.\n\nThe pros:\n\nThe community dorms are probably the number one way to meet people and builds friendships on your day one of move in before the semester begins. There are some initial resident opening weekends that encourage students to meet each other through social activities. If finances isn\u2019t an issue the second best opportunity to meet people socially on a fast track is through the social student organizations via Greek life. Followed by other student clubs. Typically early in the semester is when recruitment begins.\n\nThe fresno area is one of the cheapest big cities in the entire state. Unfortunately the weather is not like the coastal cities and does hit extremes from both sides of the spectrum.\n\nThe college degree is what matters at the end of the four years.\n\nA decent program for criminology as I have a handful of colleagues who now work for law enforcement either locally or in other parts of the state.\n\nBusiness program is a hit or miss which is highly dependent on your major usually the finance, accounting or IS options excel the most salary wise post grad from what I seen and personally speaking.\n\nThe cons:\n\nMost out of state students seem to forget that the state of California is the most populated state in the nation and driving for a weekend to SF or LA or Pismo beach is close to a 2.5-3.5 hour drive one way. Fresno is the middle of the state and doesn\u2019t exactly make it close to any of the states biggest landmarks. That\u2019s for students who like to travel cali on the weekends and explore the state.\n\nDon\u2019t stick around the Fresno 559 area post graduation unless you plan to settle for a low entry  salary and work 5-7 years until you get a competitive job title which usually usually are underpaid compared to other areas of the state.\n\nI don\u2019t see much opportunities locally for business majors unless your into entry level banking ,  AG business industry , or sales.\n\nSame for psychology majors which is the same everywhere which usually requires a graduate degree to find a competitive role. Sources from former colleagues.\n\nLastly my take away is if you are here for the social life you can pretty much find that in any four year university. If you here for a specialized education you might find it at fresno state depending on their program. If your looking for competitive internships and a competitive career you need to look elsewhere in the state preferably the Bay Area , SD, or LA where bigger company names have more internship opportunities. If you plan to go to grad school don\u2019t take the MBA program here.",

            "comment": "Fresno State is the cheapest CSU, which is great. My credentials cost 8,000 here but another school would charge twice as much. \nThose three majors are actually well off at Fresno. I\u2019m English Ed, and I believe it\u2019s a great school for teaching, psychology (great master programs that are the cheapest in CSU). Businesses has a great program here, lots of tutors at the Learning Center in the library, heard it\u2019s a great major from the people I tutor. \nHousing is cheap here, but dorms are small and there isn\u2019t enough. Though there are great apartments in walking distances. Bulldog village is a great one and the apartments at campus point. \nCollege is college and I feel I would have got the same quality of education if I had gone to Santa Cruz like I had planned (thanks covid lol). I\u2019m glad I ended up staying because it\u2019s saved me so much money. \nFresno gets crapped on and yeah it has some downs like the heat. People say crime is high here, but idk I\u2019ve lived in lots of different places and it\u2019s no different honestly. \nI overall liked the school and actually am really happy I stayed. I\u2019m about to walk and I feel like I\u2019ve been embraced by the school. It\u2019s a smaller school but it has like a homey and welcoming vibe. Lots of events for a small school. \nThough, wherever you go college is what you make it. \ud83d\ude01",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, student workers at Fresno State and all 23 CSUs are forming a union right now for better pay, benefits, and working conditions. Any of you guys who work on campus know that student workers are critical to keeping the university operational but are paid poverty wages with no sick time or parking benefits, and we're capped at 20 hours/week.\n\nMore than 4,000 of us from across the state filed for a union election with the labor board last month making it the biggest non-academic student workers union campaign in national history. The CSU is trying to delay our union election so we're getting every student worker signed up on union cards to show support.\n\nIf you haven't already, join the movement and [sign your union card here](https://www.studentassistantunion.org/Reddit)! It will still count even if you're graduating this spring. ",

The university gives students the chance to work on campus and work around YOUR CLASS SCHEDULE.\n\nYet, U and a bunch of JACKASSES of a younger generation want the extras that u don't deserve. So, in your post, you are posting the following issues. Let's break this down: \npoverty wages with no sick time or parking benefits, and we're capped at 20 hours/week.\n\nPOVERTY WAGES - u are getting the same pay as a regular person outside the campus. There are plenty of school districts paying 15.50, but the other are getting more because that's the way it's set up. Your contract is only for 20 hrs a week, and you knew about the pay and hours.\n\nSICK TIME- UNLESS you miss the memo, you are not full-time with 40 hrs a week. U don't have that luxury. If you are sick, call in and deal with it. \n\nPARKING BENIFITS-this has to be the most funniest part of your rant. Your parking isn't included in your STUDENT WORKING,  20 hrs a week contract. Either get there early and find a closer space or heaven forbid u walk . \n\nFinally,  remember what your job title says\n           \"STUDENT WORKER\"\nUNGRATEFUL COLLEGE KID, DONT LIKE IT FIND A JOB OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY",

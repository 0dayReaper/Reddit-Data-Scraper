            "comment": "Probably not the exact response you were looking for, but I graduated MCJ - Broadcast in 2017. Had a lot of friends in MCJ - Multimedia (that was the video production option at the time.) Many found editing work in TV news. There are lots of opportunities if you want to work a career while following your passion on the side. If you want to really tailor your experience to be more \"creative,\" I suggest checking out CMAC membership. They often host film making competitions, and membership gives you access to equipment and programs to help you. Live multi camera production was always a passion of mine, and CMAC helped me tremendously with that. Good luck finding the answers you're looking for, and have a wonderful day!",

    "postText": "Hello, I am planning on coming to Fresno State next year and I want to major in biochem and do pre-med. I am interested in research but I heard that the CSUs and Fresno State do not have as good reaserach programs as UCs. I really did want to apply to UCs, but my parents wanted me to stay near home and go to Fresno State. I want to ask the premed students or students who plan to go into biomedical research, what are good ways to gain research experience at Fresno State? Do students sometimes work with other schools over the summer? Is there anything I can over the summer before my freshman year to gain experience in biomedical research? ( I applied to a few summer programs, but I don't know if I will get in and I could not find any local ones). I am excited for next year, but I also have the feeling I did not live up to my full potential; I know going to a local university is not bad but I still have the desire to try and transfer to a UC (which is going to be hard from a CSU).",

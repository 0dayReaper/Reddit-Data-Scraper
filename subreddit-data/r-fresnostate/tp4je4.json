    "postText": "Some background;\n\nI'm from SoCal and have recently been accepted to [Fresno](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g32414-sno_California-Vacations.html) State for an impacted major that I simply can't pass up. I have only visited Fresno once, so have little experience with the area. Doing research on the apartment complexes for the area is pretty depressing, with off campus housing all having sub 2 to 3 stars on yelp and, generally, just some pretty horrendous living situations at nearby apartments. Not to mention [car](https://www..com/RentalCars-g32414-Fresno_Californi.html) break ins and thefts, which is common where I'm from too but still an issue on my mind. I am male searching for a one bedroom or studio in the 1000-1400 range just to provide context.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with a decent apartment complex in the area? As implied I have a [car](https://www.tripadviso.com/RentalCars-g32414-Fresno_California.html) so don't mind a 10-20min commute and am mostly just looking for something that isn't falling apart and has competent management. Gated is a plus but not like that makes much of a difference anyways.\n\nI apologize if this isn't a good place to ask this but thank you nonetheless!",

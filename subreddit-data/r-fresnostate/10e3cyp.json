    "postText": "Hi!I live in San Diego and just finished my associates in child development and finished all the requirements for SDSU\u2019s BS in child dev program with all As. I have a 3.0 GPA exactly. SDSU is pretty competitive rn so I applied to Fresno State as a backup, what are the chances of me getting into Fresno state? Esp since I\u2019m not local. My grandparents have lived here in Fresno for decades now, and are getting old so I\u2019m hoping I can help them with things and live with them up here since they\u2019ve done so much for me even though yes I am well aware Fresno is the definition of hell on earth and is called F no for a reason. Also my best friend wants to move up to Fresno too because her rent is just too damn high down here.\n\nso essentially: wondering the odds of a so cal invasion",

That's what usually happens when a major is impacted, they raise the requirements.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStay in touch and don't hesitate to DM me. I graduated from Fresno State and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the school, the city, or anything else.",

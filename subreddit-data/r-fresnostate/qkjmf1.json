If you absolutely need windows you can purchase a parallels license for $40 at [fresnostate.onthehub.com](https://fresnostate.onthehub.com). Have to use Windows 10 on ARM Insider Preview version. All else fails, just use apporto.",

My girlfriend hates dealing with technical issues and wanted something that last a good 5+ years so I thought I'd give her a new macbook.\n\nI have an M1 mac and pdfs are no issues. It all depends on what programs you need to run. I am a CSCI major, and can run all my c++ python, and web development programs, but skype for instance which i need to use doesn't run well. I use the whole Microsoft office suite with no issues also.\n\nYou can go to [https://isapplesiliconready.com/](https://isapplesiliconready.com/) to search apps and see if they work on the M1 mac yet or not. \n\nAlso unrelated to your question, but since the new M1 macs are all integrated i.e. no user swappable components like some other laptops. It might not last as long as some other options since repair when the battery or something goes bad will be more difficult due to the design. Still a solid laptop though and performance is on par or better with some windows laptops",

Just making sure since it wasn't easily googlable.\n\nYeah I was thinking about repairability too. I was thinking about getting those framework laptops, or an older Dell XPS so I can fix whatever comes up. I just figured Apple was so good with their a series chips on iPhones when it comes to updates and relatively longer lasting devices (as long as the battery doesn't trip up) that the new MacBooks might get the same treatment.\n\nThanks for the link, I forgot that site existed.",

I've taken some c++ classes in community college and will take assembly and java next semester. What kind of classes did you take? how was it using a mac in all of that?",

Was the workload more or less? Were the professors easier on you? Were tests harder or easier? Were classes on zoom and just like lectures? please just tell me anything on what the online classes will probably be like this semester so i can calm my nerves. Thank you!!!",

It felt like it took me longer to get things done because I was used to doing work at school and have a shitty home environment that is inconducive to being productive lol. The professors I had were fairly lenient. It depends on the instructor how they choose to structure the online classes. This time around faculty have had more time to prepare for online classes in the fall, so things will probably run more smooth. My advice would be to just relax and do your work honestly, and you most likely won\u2019t run into any issues.\n\nI disagree about rate my professors, it\u2019s mostly by salty people who got mad they failed or by people hyped that they had an easy A \ud83d\ude02 Not really much in between for a fair assessment. You\u2019re better off talking to actual people from ur major.",

            "comment": "Honestly I got lucky with my instructors. I\u2019m a Crim major and he was pretty lenient. He would give us unlimited time basically, it was a few hours to do the test so it was like a long time. And it was open book! \n\nMy philosophy instructor gave me extra time to complete assignments and such. Which was pretty easy. \n\nIt depends on the instructor really. I heard some real sucky stories about instructors who didn\u2019t give a damn. I know they are probably going to use the lockdown browser a lot, it can record you with the camera while you take the exam. And it doesn\u2019t let you open any tabs other the the exam one you\u2019re on. It has instructions and is kinda self explanatory. Your instructor can modify how it can be used too! So they\u2019ll have it on their syllabus or exam pages. \n\nRead the rate my professor reviews. It\u2019ll really tell you a lot about how they are in regular class and you can make the judgment based off of that. I got so lucky! I know my Crim instructor said he would do lockdown for fall semester if it was still online. He\u2019s strict and such but it\u2019s expected. He\u2019s a straight forward and a simple man!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m on mobile so it\u2019s hard to answer everything directly. But yes. We had zoom class times. That would be exactly at the time of regular class if we were on campus! My Phil instructor recorded them and posted them on canvas files so we could watch it we weren\u2019t in for class. But my Crim instructor didn\u2019t. But his material was open notes. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be the best response given I got lucky. If you have any more questions feel free to ask!\n\nEdit 2: Yes rate my professor can be hit and miss. Although I\u2019ve been reading more reviews recently and they have been very in depth and honest. And you can obviously tell which ones are salty or just easy \u2018A\u2019 responses by reading them. And you can separate them from the other responses that give you a better understanding of the class and instructor. \n\nRegardless, you can make your conclusion off of that lol. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a bad thing if others still posted the review of the class. But you obviously don\u2019t have to listen to me or do that. It\u2019s still a pretty nice tool in my opinion.",

            "comment": "The way online classes were in Spring 2020 is not the way it'll be in Fall 2020. This is because everyone (professors, students, etc) suddenly got pushed into online sessions. No one was prepared to teach using Zoom. Fall 2020 should be smoother now that professors had time to prepare and train. \n\nI think workload depends on your major a lot. As a math major, my workload was the same but more challenging since we had to type our homeworks. Exams were hard because professors had to find a way to make sure we were not cheating. However, most of my professors didn't mind if some homework were turned in a little late. Zoom lectures were not the same as in person lectures. This is because we all found it hard to type on our computer screens compared to having a huge white board and markers. The syllabus was followed though.",

            "comment": "A grade of D is considered passing for GE, in all i think but your upper division capstone/writing class. Your major may also require a higher grade of C for passing. You want to watch out for it lowering your gpa, which may affect your financial aid or scholarship, and you may end up on academic probation if your gpa gets low. Meet with your GE advisor and Major advisor, make a plan, and see if you can just take the lower grade to move on",

I had a teacher who would give me failing grades on my papers because he disagreed with my points. He gave me a D- on my final report, and to prove my point I turned in the same paper the following semester and my teacher that year gave me an A.\n\nFYI, this was a Poli Sci class and the teacher was supper left leaning. I mean to the point where Obama and Biden come of as right wing. To be fair, although I don't identify as republican I do love playing devil's advocate. I intentionally chose to argue for the view points that where opposite of his even if I didn't agree with them.\n\nI had background in debate and I'm use to arguing both sides. Regardless of views, my paper including support for my claims as well as examples, and he simply refused to acknowledge them.\n\nMy goal was to piss him off and I can say that I did, and it only cost me a D. All good though because I got an A the second time around.",

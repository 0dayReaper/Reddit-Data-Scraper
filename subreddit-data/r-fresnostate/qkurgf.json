I thought you were asking how tot ell if you're in good academic standing. as far as applying here's an edit to another comment I made. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n yes, if you are in good academic standing you can re-apply. There's nothing that can stop you from that. if you're confused on the process you can call admissions. But I believe you just need to re-apply as a returning student.",

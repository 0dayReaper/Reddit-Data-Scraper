There isn't much for work in the Fresno area, you'll definitely have to take a remote internship or move for the summer. The Computer Engineering program is much better. It depends on what you want to do for a career.",

What about cogsci with a minor in CS or taking CS classes for all electives in cogsci major? Would that option work for these career choices as well? If you know",

It is much harder than the CS program but the professors are great and the degree opens so many more doors.  I graduated from the CompE program and I now work for Intel. Also, the alumni for CompE are much more active than most other programs and are very helpful with job placement. For example, I recruit for Intel at Fresno State and we look for CompE students. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions, just DM me and we can talk on discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can get a CSCI degree and a minor in CompE or the other way around.",

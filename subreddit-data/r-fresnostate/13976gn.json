I think even the old student union building is open on the ground floor. \nIn the new building though, you could use the conference room if nobody is using it, but usually no one is on Fridays because everyone is going home. \nPeter\u2019s building has a few study places and quiet on Fridays. \nThere is one little study room in the sociology building somewhere. It\u2019s a hole in the wall type room. \nThere are little hidden areas.",

The.philosophy department did it and usually chair or ask the dean of the college or one professor who may convince or persuade the chair  of the department. Just be honest and tell them you're there to study and don't have any options that doesn't require paying for IHOP or Denny's and just getting some classmates to support and want this helps a lot",

Other csus like SF have only 2 floors of the library open 24/7 and they have a someone who checks ur dtudent ID and no other palcesin Fresno has 24/7 cafe. \n\nMy friend and I use to go to the dorms and study in the shared Community area with a front desk  open 24/7",

Students.need.jobs and I'm sure many would even volunteer to check IDs. We also have campus police and a police.officr on.campus.\nTuition is way too expensive to cheapen the right to a quality of an education that served the students interest in every way.\n\nAlso the library lights are on like 24/7 like wtf",

Sometimes the website is not up to date, so always speak with a counselor.\n\nThe CS department is enough to get a degree, but more importantly you need to get an internship. Start Googling and get on the grind. I'm computer engineering but the sentiments are similar.",

I was decently prepared post grad getting a job, though I did a LOT of prep/work outside of school. \n\nJust make sure you get into the project classes asap and start looking into what your goal job wants as projects on your resume. Go to the club too, it\u2019s not the most active club but it will have good opportunities for learning and networking.\n\nMeet with an advisor (the one specifically for the sciences). They\u2019ll be able to help you roadmap it.",

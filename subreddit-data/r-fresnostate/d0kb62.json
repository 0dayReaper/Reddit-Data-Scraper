No one really plays competitive Overwatch on consoles.\n\nWe are offering Overwatch on console only while we launch the Varsity League of Legends team... once we get that underway we can look to building a Varsity Overwatch team. \n\nWhy LoL first? When we asked for student response on which games to start Varsity play LoL was the clear winner. \n\nSo please.. let your preference be heard! Fill out the form on the Esports page. \n\nwww.fresnostate.edu/esports\n\nAlso, look for upcoming announcement on IG/Twitter about Overwatch Grand Finals Watch party on Sept. 29th!\n\n@fresnosstatees",

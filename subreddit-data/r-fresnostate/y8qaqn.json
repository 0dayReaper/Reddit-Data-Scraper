It\u2019s sad people forget the athletes there are student-athletes and have to go to school and major just like everyone else then go and workout perform for the school!",

That's less.\n\nAccording to the Fresno State Website FSU has 8 departments excluding athletics. Or 60 different programs. Measure E would provide 36 million annually. 36 million divided by 3 = 12 million. So Athletics gets 12 million annually.  \n\n\nThe rest of the departments if we divide 24million  by the 8 departments = 3 million. So every year athletics gets 12 million and each department gets 3 million. If you want to take it further each department will then divide its share up to each program. 24 million divided by 60 programs = 400k annually.\n\nAs you can see athletics gets the bigger share here and that is my issue with the bill. I am not against funding athletics. But let's fund it equally to ALL departments.",

Meaning that each academic department gets more funding than ALL athletic departments. \n\n12 million split by 18 means 666k for each athletic department which is TINY compared to the value athletics brings to the school. Fresno state athletics brings in millions of dollars to the school in value that academics profits off of. Even the Valley children\u2019s deal has a portion cut out for the nursing program. There isn\u2019t an academic department that cuts a portion of their funding to give to ANY athletic department. We are in this together and should rise together.",

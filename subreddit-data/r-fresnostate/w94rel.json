            "comment": "Well, everyone's definitions of \"good\" and \"safe\" are varying.   \n\n\nIt has been a common place for many students to live for many years. There are loud parties and gatherings and the place can be a little problematic due to its proximity to other places but overall I feel it is a decent place to live if you didn't prefer the dorm life.   \n\n\nLots of social opportunities and walking distance to the university and the stadium is nice.",

Never leave anything in your car overnight that\u2019s valuable ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s visible from outside the car. Bulldog village isn\u2019t in the nicest part of town, but it\u2019s all gated and many students live there w no problems, just be smart about not leaving stuff in your car.",

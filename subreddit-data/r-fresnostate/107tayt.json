Just work hard. \n\nIt also depends on your major. Most will be the same. Something like engineering will be hard as hell no matter what.",

            "comment": "Biggest tips for college success:\n\n1) Go to tutoring. Hand in hand with this, utilize the library. Basically, take advantage of the resources for outside class-time help. Getting a study buddy to keep you honest during planned study times can be difficult for some people. The tutoring center, I'm sure, would gladly figure something out to support you learning good study habits.\n\n2) There's a saying about college. For every unit a course is worth, expect to spend 2-3 hours of time studying and completing homework for that class outside of it. A full time student, enrolled in 15 units, should schedule time for themselves every day of the week, to make sure they study 30-45 hours a week.\n\n3) Block out your time in the week in hours/half hours. You'll need eight hours of sleep every night. You'll need three or so hours for meals. You'll be in class for a certain amount of hours. \n\nFinding out how much time you have in the week, is the first step to taking control of what you do with your time. \n\nFor me, I account for the fact I don't ever want to study an hour before bed. I don't want to study immediately after work. So: I schedule study time like it's class time, and stick to it, so that I spend enough time with the material each week in some way.\n\nDoing the above will put you way ahead, even if you don't immediately take to your courses. Avoiding spending time with the material will never get you anywhere. If you're feeling any anxiety about your workload, the tutorial centers and counselors on campus will help you get organized and pump you up.",

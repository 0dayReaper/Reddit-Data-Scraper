    "postText": "I applied as a transfer to Fresno State for this upcoming fall and also applied to the University Village Apartments however, my mom is having health issues and I have decided to take a gap year and stay home instead. I am looking for someone to relet my lease (take my spot) at the University Village Apartments this upcoming fall. The lease starts this August and ends in July of next year. The floor plan is a 4 bedroom/4 bathroom fully furnished shared room type apartment. Each tenant pays for their own individual lease which includes a private bedroom and bathroom and also the other amenities that come with it. The monthly payments are $764 and come with reserved covered parking included as well. Some of the amenities included are a pool, a fitness center, a recreational center, a washer and dryer in each unit, high speed fiber optic internet in every unit, and much more. The apartment complex is only about half a mile walk to the Fresno State campus making it very convenient for students as well. I am also willing to pay for your application fee. If you are interested please feel free to leave a comment or send me a private message.",

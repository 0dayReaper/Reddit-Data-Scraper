If costs weren't an issue, then I don't see any reason not to do it unless you really want to enjoy your break. I'd personally rather get my GEs out of the way so that I can take more major classes during my Fall and Spring semesters, so I'm curious what issue you have with taking it over summer/winter.\n\nI will say that, although the GE I'm considering taking over winter isn't a prereq, I'm taking a minor as well and my schedule already feels pretty packed, so getting classes out that I don't have to worry about increasing my workload during a normal semester would be nice.",

I feel like I'd rather just take the GE in the regular semesters, and leave summer/winter for courses for: Pre-req/flowchart/graduation deadline purposes, or you prefer a certain professor teaching that course, or you're future semester is impacted and you'd need to free up a spot to get into a major course. \n\nA bit of personal experience from the mental health side of things, I was much happier doing 3:1 or 3:2 ratios of Major to GE courses per semester. When I was doing 4:0 or 5:0 (god help you if 6:0), I never had a chance to divert my attention to that \"easy\" course. For me also, it was nice to have at least one of my classes not solving math/physics problems xD.\n\nIf you're doing a minor, then summer/winter is almost required I feel. That is a lot of extra courses, whether GE, Major, or Minor.",

In the summer or winter at a community and transfer them. 1) way cheaper 2) free electronic transfer 3) they do offer alot of the classes that are very similar to here. 4) you don\u2019t have to do the GE portfolio with it.

Then I am assume summer and winter classes here are just as worth it if they are cheaper. I think people usually don\u2019t want to give up their summer or winter break. But if you can get ahead with them I think it\u2019s worth it. Some people I know did take winter classes and they didn\u2019t mind it.",

I heard from my sister that she had financial aid issues since she was attending both community and Fresno State and the same time, so I wanted to ask if you had the same problems? Did you receive less/more financial aid, or any financial aid at all? Maybe I'm misunderstanding as well if summer/winter classes don't even offer it, but I just don't want my regular financial aid to be affected in some way.\n\nAlso, could you explain why the GE portfolio doesn't have to be done?\n\nLastly, would you say that most professors at a community (don't know which you went to) are better than Fresno State professors as far as GE's are concerned?\n\nThanks for any info you can provide!!",

When it comes to ge portfolio bc it was at community and not at Fresno you don\u2019t have to do it (for those classes). And honestly the professors I had over summer at clovis community were so nice and super caring. They also had so much passion for what they were teaching I think they are more passionate about their subject then some professors here at state",

            "comment": "I'll repeat this story that I've told a few times before: \n\nWhen I was there working on my Masters, I taught a lab in McKee-Fisk. One morning, when I walked up, there was a squirrel standing outside the automatic doors. I assumed he'd run off when I got closer and the doors opened, but instead he *ran inside the building*. I was freaking out when he ran into a journalism professor's office. The professor opened a drawer, which contained a huge bag of unshelled peanuts, gave one to the squirrel, and then told me, \"He does this all the time.\" The squirrel took the peanut and ran back to the automatic doors, waiting for me to come back and open them so he could go back outside.",

I have seen people jokingly get near a squirrel while holding Panda Express and the squirrel jumped at them. Also just a few weeks ago I get out of a final and saw a Squirrel eating a normal sized glazed donut. So yes you can feed them, but how friendly they are I am not too sure it depends on what you have.",

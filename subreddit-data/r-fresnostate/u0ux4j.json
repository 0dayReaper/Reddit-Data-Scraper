    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I currently go to UC Merced and our food has been pretty horrendous throughout this school year. We had a town hall meeting the other day regarding the food quality and we were basically told that because we are located in the Central Valley, we are somewhat isolated from big manufacturers so we don't have as many options when it comes to sourcing food. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis confused me because Fresno State as well as Stanislaus State are located in the Central Valley and surpass us in food quality (at least according to [niche.com](https://niche.com)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was wondering, what is your food like on campus? Any complaints? How much is your meal plan? (Our cheapest one is 4,630).",

We also have a salad bar that has nice fresh fruit, we have a coffee/ tea dispenser, and soft serve ice cream machine. I\u2019ve been satisfied with the dining hall the times I\u2019ve gone.\nAlthough I haven\u2019t been to the dining hall since covid so I can\u2019t say how it is currently.",

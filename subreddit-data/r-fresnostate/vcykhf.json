    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone!\n\nI've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!\n\nRight now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.\n\nWe have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!\n\nYou can also visit our website below for more information.\n\nTFS Website: [https://www.societyfuturist.org/](https://www.societyfuturist.org/)\n\nTFS National Discord: [https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P](https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eftqz6e6bt591.png?width=2318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=22b345d7772d26841cd621b5299ec12bf49d58f0",

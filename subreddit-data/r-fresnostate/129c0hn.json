    "postText": "Is anyone here majoring in biochem? I am going here next year and thinking of majoring in biochem, and I am kinda just hearing bad things about it (its too difficult, etc.) Is it doable? I am also going to be doing track and xc so I'm scared about being able to balance it all. Can any biochem majors provide me some reassurance?",

You may need to sacrifice social and leisure time in order to be able to do everything. It's more just a question of how bad you want it and what you're willing to do to succeed.",

If biochem disgusts you and you are really passionate about the diversity of life (which I felt was more heavily emphasized than molecular and cell biology) then by all means go for it. Also the prereqs for upper division bio classes tended to be a bit stricter than Chem.",

    "postText": "idk if this is true or not; or if ppl are just fucking with me. but i keep hearing ppl tell me to not wear fresno state bulldog gear outside of campus events bc of the local gangs? i guess rivals find it offensive and they\u2019ll target ppl for it? \n\ni feel like it\u2019s easy to tell that it\u2019s school gear like\ud83e\udd28 ?? so like what, am i not allowed to wear red or rep my school lol im genuinely curious. cus this \u201cadvice\u201d is coming from ppl \u201cborn &amp; raised\u201d in fresno as well as outsiders\n\nwhat are yalls opinion?",

            "comment": "It is a legit thing. While Fresno State is in one of the nicer areas of the city, I would still recommend not wearing gear outside of the immediate area around campus. Is it still unlikely as all hell? Yes. Does it increase your risk of being targeted? Yes. I'd also recommend against wearing solid red or blue shirts in any areas you wouldn't wear school gear. It is stupid as fuck we even have to worry about it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Fresno State has a dope af campus and tons of very nice areas to study and chill, but ultimately it is risk mitigation.",

No. I\u2019m not trying to pull members from here, but after visiting this subreddit for a little bit I\u2019ve concluded that you\u2019ll have a better chance to receive the advice you\u2019re looking for over there.\n\nI\u2019ve put a lot of time, energy, and some money into the group to make it the #1 group for advice for Fresno State related stuff. It gives back soooooo much to people. Some people have met their best friends on there too.\n\nCheers!",

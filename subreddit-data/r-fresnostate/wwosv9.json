    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am a returning senior this Fall 2022 semester and I\u2019ve noticed something. There seems to be a lot more traffic and difficulty finding parking spaces this semester. I arrive about an hour early before my classes and still have problems finding spots. So much so I ended up being late to a chemistry course.\n\nI have spoken with multiple friends and peers about this and have even overheard multiple students mention an increase in the number of drivers. \n\nI\u2019m well aware there will always be traffic and difficulties finding parking but has anyone else noticed it\u2019s been really bad?",

Now that most classes are back in person, I think the amount of traffic has just gone up as well. It's been really bad especially at the roundabout on Chestnut and Barstow",

It would have increased parking capacity and it would have increased the price of the semester parking pass by only $5 (I think it was 5, no more than 10). They voted against it because they didn\u2019t want increase parking fees even though the increase wouldn\u2019t have started until after the structure was done (and half the student body would have graduated by then). Still makes me annoyed thinking about it because parking was bad back then too.",

It was hard to find parking pre Covid even when I have afternoon classes.        Last two semester were fine since there were still online class but I don\u2019t want to imagine looking for parking when it\u2019s so busy.",

Will update this comment with what they answer.\n\nEdit - This is everything they said, if it helps at all:\n\nAs far as I know, the entire LoR(s) has to be uploaded with the application. There is no reference notification by Smittcamp. UNLESS they\u2019ve changed the process. If the application process hasn\u2019t changed, there\u2019s a form that is filled out by the individual providing a reference.  It gets attached to the actual LoR and is included in the final application packet. The process to get the letters (+forms) would have started at least a month or two ago.",

Back then they would send everyone who applied a letter and the letter would let you know if you were accepted, a high alternate, an alternative, or rejected. There\u2019s a good chance other people at your school applied to smittcamp so you can ask them what their letter said if you\u2019re curious.",

I\u2019m just concerned because may is approaching and I need to make a decision and smittcamp has yet to contact me about my status. Do you remember when in April you were contacted?",

If I wanted it I needed to have the paperwork submitted by April 23rd 5pm. So anytime now is when you should be getting a response. If you\u2019re curious and/or need an answer asap I would recommend reaching out to the smittcamp office and asking them when an alternate should expect to hear if they made it or not. Their number is 559-278-8160 and you can find them online as well. You could try messaging the [Instagram](https://instagram.com/smittcampfamilyhonorscollege?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) account if you don\u2019t want to call, odds are that\u2019s ran by a smittcamp student who will probably have more information than I do.",

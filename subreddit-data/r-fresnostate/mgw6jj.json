First if you need food the student cupboard is a great option if you need items to cook or snack in the day, especially if you don't have a lot of money. As well they carry produce once a week. Second is free printing in the Fresno state gym on campus. I would have 10-20 page papers that would cost me a lot in printing. All you have to do at the gym is walk up stairs and go to the career development center. Third is meeting new people which I recommend joining a club. Whether it be athletic, major related, or literally anything else. Getting around campus is just about experience, I wound print out a map. If that doesn't help, majority of people on campus would help you if you asked.",

I\u2019m not sure how that will work this fall, but I know they\u2019ve done it in the past. Have you received anything about an orientation date?",

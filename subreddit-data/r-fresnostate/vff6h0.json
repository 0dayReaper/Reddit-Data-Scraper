Those are 1 unit classes and they have fun activities such as tennis, kickboxing, judo, dance, swimming etc.\nJust search up kinesiology activity class in class search and find what you\u2019re interested in. They\u2019re all very relaxed and chill classes where the only thing you need to do to get an A is show up most of the time.",

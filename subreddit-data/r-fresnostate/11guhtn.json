    "postText": "I want some advice; I am going to Fresno State next year and I am thinking of going into the medical field so I want to major in biochemistry and minor in either computer science or music. How difficult and time consuming is a major in biochem? Would it be feasible to do both compsci and biochem? (I am also going to do track and cross country, orchestra, and would like to do other extra curriculars). Any premed students got advice? I was also thinking of just doing computerscience as my major and just doing the pre med requisites, but I think biochem will help more with the mcat in the long run. Is this true?",

But doing Biochem and a minor is doable, it\u2019s just going to take a lot of studying time and dedication. But you got this!",

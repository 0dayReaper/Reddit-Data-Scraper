I\u2019ve gotten information about a STEP cohort where you get classes with the same group of people and you don\u2019t need to worry about getting into classes. I\u2019m interested but just wanted to see what any liberal studies majors have experienced or heard. Would it be better to just register and take the classes on my own?",

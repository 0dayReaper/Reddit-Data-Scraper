That was a great game and I\u2019m sorry it ended because of crap refs.\n\nY\u2019all are awesome fans and who  knows, maybe we\u2019ll see y\u2019all in the MWC championship game :)",

Boise is always so hospitable, even when I wear Bulldog gear around town! It\u2019s a bitter rivalry, but I also believe it is a respected one!",

The only hostile ones are usually ones that hide behind a Reddit account and say stuff. If anything, most of us only talk crap about ourselves haha. But yeah, much respect to you guys and good luck!",

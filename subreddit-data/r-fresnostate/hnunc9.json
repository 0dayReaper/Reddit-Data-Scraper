That's reason enough for me to not go near them. I have a furry dog at home that would cause an unwanted flea infestation.",

The squirrels who get bit by cats also tend to die because cats carry germs :((( \n\nI guess I could understand the flea. I never saw any of my squirrel friends with any especially my chonki friend Pedro. I loved him so much. I miss him a lot :( I live too far now. Hope you\u2019re doing okay though!",

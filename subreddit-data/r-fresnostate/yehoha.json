    "postText": "I\u2019ve been considering taking 2 winter intersession classes over the break (both 3 unit classes, so 6 units total). I know that the pricing for winter classes are pretty steep, but I have some left over money from financial aid for fall so the price isn\u2019t really the issue here. \nMy main concern is that I\u2019m afraid that taking the 6 units over such a short period of time might be unmanageable with the potential workload of classes. (They are both counseling classes btw)\nTaking these classes though can help my chances of getting into grad school a little bit more. I\u2019m set to graduate in the spring so spacing these classes out between other semesters wouldn\u2019t be possible for me to do).\nThoughts on the manageability of doing winter intersession??",

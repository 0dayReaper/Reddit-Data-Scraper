I have all As in every other class, and 1 B. Can I get my acceptance rescinded because of that one class?",

If you're a local resident, have above a 3.0 GPA, and above like the 50th percentile for SAT score, you should be good. \n\nI had a 3.3 cumulative GPA and 1480 SAT (2400 point system) and got in no problem.\n\nAnd if you're already in, there's nothing to worry about. I'm pretty sure they don't even look at senior year.",

The survey is anonymous and it will take you approximately 10-15 minutes. It would be greatly appreciated, thank you. \n\nLink: https://fresnostate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_06xsV9k9qkX834y",

In using these past surveys, it is important to use the same scales as them since each section is scored differently.  Having \"strongly x, x, &amp; somewhat x\" is more for the participants; the responses are converted into a numerical value to help calculate the results for each section.  Hope this kind of makes sense and thank you for taking the survey.",

Rules:

Rule 1: Keep your discussion civil: Regardless of the intent behind your usage, everyone, no matter their age, gender, sexual preferences, race, profession, or affiliation deserves to feel welcome in this subreddit. Any language that is racist, sexist, inflammatory, homophobic, wishing harm upon, or otherwise threatening, rude, toxic, demeaning toward any user, moderator, student, professor, staff, or community member will not be tolerated. Users are expected to keep their discussion civil at all times within posts and comments.

Rule 2: Do not repost content: Do not post a link or discussion if that topic has already been posted. Any updates to a current news story or discussion should be posted in the original thread if the update comes on the same day of the original post.

Rule 3: No multiple similar posts: No multiple similar, posts from the same user. When a single user makes multiple posts discussing a similar topic within a short period of time, it makes it difficult for people to discuss the topic. Keeping the posts to a single post condenses discussion to a single place and reduces the likelihood of a single user "taking over" the front page.

Rule 4: No self-promotion, subreddit promotion, or spam: Self-promotion in r/FresnoState is defined as making posts or comments to content that is your own work, such as your own YouTube channel, eBay store, trying to sell T-shirts, promoting your own career (seeking to attract votes or sponsorship, etc.) or anything similar, regardless of monetization.

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI've created a new tool for Fresno State students:\n\n[https://gradetier.com/](https://gradetier.com/)\n\nWith GradeTier, you can see grade distribution information for about 15,000 past courses.  As far as I know, all undergraduate and graduate departments and courses from 2011-2019 should be included. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no instructor names provided, and courses for each school year were aggregated together. For example, if there were 3 professors teaching 5 sections of Physics 101 over 2018-2019, their total grade distributions would be combined to form a single 'Physics 101 - 2018-2019' record. Nevertheless, I think the information should be useful in seeing past course information, especially when there are 9 years of data. \n\nThere are no paywalls, just a simple design: first choose CSU Fresno, then select a department (and optionally a course number or year), and click on the desired course.\n\nIn addition to other sources like RateMyProfessor, I'm hoping the website can serve as an objective piece of information when deciding which course to take.\n\nLet me know what you think, and contact me if you find any issues - thanks!",

I'm currently taking a Psych class based on Research and my group member and I recently created a Qualtrics survery that is open for ALL college students in all University institutions(no matter what state, college year, etc. you are, I welcome you to take the survey). Our survey is based on Online vs. In-person instruction, as COVID has evolved in the last year and instruction types are rapidly changing.\n\nI encourage you to take this survey, so I can gather information.\n\nAny help is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nBelow is the following link to the Qualtrics Survey:\n\n[https://fresnostate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bvIlZIzkherL89g](https://fresnostate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bvIlZIzkherL89g)",

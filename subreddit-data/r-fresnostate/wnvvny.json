    "postText": "Thank you Fresno State, you're still here even my ex abandoned me. I've failed many times and yet you stood by my side and gave me a chance. This is my last semester and I am so happy to be done and be independent and go explore the world. This summer was the lowest point of my life to a point I still felt the pain sometimes. But I'm better, improved, and will continue to improve and I will push thru like a F-22 Raptor 5th gen fighter jet activating its afterburner, damn it was so hard at first. I really want to get my Masters and I think I might as well. \n\nI hope whoever is reading this keep GRINDING! Enjoy life and let go of the shits that you can't control! \n\nThank you internet, you let me rant to the world now I felt better =).\n\nBest regards.",

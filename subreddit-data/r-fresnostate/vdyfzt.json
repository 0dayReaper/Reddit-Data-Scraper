The rule for religious exemption is that you are a practicing member of a faith that does not recognize vaccinations. This includes any prior vaccinations (not COVID) that you may have had in school. They WILL check this so I would highly encourage you to be honest. If you've attended ANY public school in the State your vaccination records will already be on file and if they discover you received other vaccines they will not accept the exemption under religious beliefs. Its a \"all or nothing\" exemption when it comes to using religion. If you attempt to file a medical exemption, you will have to prove to the Student Health Department that you have a medically DOCUMENTED condition that prohibits you from taking the vaccine UNDER DIRECTION OF A LICENSED MD. They do not accept \"medical exemptions\" from chiropractors, holistic doctors or anyone who isn't a licensed physician in the State.",

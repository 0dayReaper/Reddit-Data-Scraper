    "postText": "I'm confused between asu and CSU Fresno. My major is computer science undergraduate. (I'm an international student (india). )\n\nAt ASU: I have to pay around $160k for 4 years.\n\nAt csu Fresno: I have to pay around $110k for 4 years.\n\nAsu is way better in ranking and all its a very big\n\nuniversity (attractive). But CSU Fresno is pocket\n\nfriendly (+ this is only my undergraduate i also have\n\nto think about masters).\n\nSo if i choose ASU is $50k risk worth it? Or I'll get same job at CSU Fresno?\n\nWhich one is better according to you guys keeping in mind about location, salary, ROIjob opportunities,on campus jobs, etc factors.\n\nTHANKS IN ADVANCE \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd1d",

            "comment": "Heard the  CS department here isn\u2019t the greatest but if you got the drive you should be fine. Fresno also isn\u2019t a tech hub but with internships and really networking you should be able to find a good job and CSU Fresno overall isn\u2019t bad. But just for undergrad, I don\u2019t think it necessarily matters too much if you\u2019re going elsewhere for a master\u2019s also. Idk tho just saying",

And a lot of internship opportunities. \n\nFresno isn\u2019t a big city so you well probably spent most of your four years on campus only. There\u2019s also very limited choice of subjects as there are aren\u2019t many professors. And one of the professors is really really hard. \n\nI would choose ASU. Btw which campus of ASU?",

I\u2019m originally about an hour from fresno and throughout my life I\u2019ve heard good things about FSU. It\u2019s really not about where you get your degree but how much opportunity there is to network. I fresno has decent options and if it saves you money it seems like a good choice. You can thrive anywhere bro. \ud83e\udd1d",

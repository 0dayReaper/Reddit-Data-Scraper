I currently am working on a project called \"222\" which is a collection of beats I have made over the past 2 years. \n\nIf anybody would like to record a verse/ or knows of anyone who would hop on these tracks let me know and we can arrange something.\n\nHere is the project of beats that I\u2019m looking for people to record over\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/cloutmike/sets/222a1](https://soundcloud.com/cloutmike/sets/222a1) \n\nenjoy &lt;3",

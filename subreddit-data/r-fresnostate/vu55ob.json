Does anyone know how strict that is? I\u2019m not an inherently loud person but will it be like, library quiet?",

It\u2019s not really enforced unless a student decides to call the RA on call that night and complain, which everyone has a right to do. When you move in, your RA for your floor will have a floor meeting and they will explain all the rules to you as well. If you don\u2019t think this dorm would suit you, you could always get a free room change the first two weeks, then it goes up to $50. I hope this helps! I haven\u2019t worked in the dorms since the 2018-19 school year so things may have changed a little since then but it should be roughly the same.",

    "postText": "I realize the semester starts soon, so before you take your mom and dad to the campus bookstore and drop 1k on a macbook that will probably be used for Facebook more often than for school, check out the Laptops for Checkout at the library. \n\nThe library has 230 Linux laptops available to borrow FOR THE WHOLE SEMESTER! It has everything you need (OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office, it does the same stuff). \n\nThe battery life isn't the best (3 hours tops) but it's probably all you need before you can find a plug at the USU or in a class. \n\n\nIf you have any trouble with it (because it's NOT running Windows or OSX) post questions here or just look it up online, it's pretty simple stuff. Oh and because they're running Linux they somehow can't put locks on stuff like changing the background, installing programs, etc. so it's like having a legit laptop. Not to mention they give you a sweet Targus case for it too. \n\nHappy new year everyone. ",

When you bring them back they just wipe them clean and redeploy their standard image. \n\nAlso note that if you don't get one of the semester-long laptops, they have a few additional ones that you can check out (I think) by the hour. Not great, but if you're in a pinch it's good to know about.",

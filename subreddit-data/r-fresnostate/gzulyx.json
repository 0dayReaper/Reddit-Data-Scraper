And I like Woodward park :) \n\nThe county I love driving up to Millerton lake, especially towards the evening hours! I get to see the beautiful night sky and enjoy a peaceful drive (at least during quarantine). \n\nI just moved out of California last month though :(( I\u2019m in Denver now. But I enjoy nature and such so it depends on your interest!",

Sacramento seems to just fall flat, and the endless brewpub clones downtown serving similar bar foods makes it really hard to actually find a place that is out of the box and really decent.  Man i miss Mike's tri tip sandwiches and some doghouse grill.",

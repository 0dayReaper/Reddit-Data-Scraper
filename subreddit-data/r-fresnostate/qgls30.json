Tests were easy, and there were only 2 papers which were 1k words each. \n\nI also enjoyed Ling 115: sociolinguistics with Michael Shepard specifically. It is a digital campus class so not in person, and each week just some videos he posts you watch then do either a short quiz or some discussion post. I found his topics interesting, and since it is videos he records you can watch at any speed that suits you. Never spent more than a single day a week on the class. There was a paper at the end since all the Upper div GE have the 2k word writing assignment, but the rest of the class was so easy I didn't mind having to do a paper at the end of the semester.",

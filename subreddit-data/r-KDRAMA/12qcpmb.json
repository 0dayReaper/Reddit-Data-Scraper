    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.

Tomorrow is the final, so I'm a bit sad it's over but on the other hand I'm excited to start a new drama again.",

The dynamic is not like that for most of the drama though!  Although I hate that trope in particular I ended up loving the characters and the drama.  Just wanted to give a heads up!  \n\nI would recommend Jewel in the Palace and I second Six Flying Dragons as well.  They are both somewhat older, but neither are particularly misogynistic.  Six Flying Dragons tells the story of the founding of Joseon, and Jewel in the Palace focuses on the life story of Jang Geum who started in the royal kitchens and ends up becoming a physician.  Jewel in the Palace in particular showcases the FL's tenacity, intelligence, and compassion, and focuses mainly on different female characters.  I was dubious at first, since it was made in 2003, but I ended up enjoying it a lot.  Six Flying Dragons focuses mostly on male characters, and it is epic!  There is a strong female character who is part of the six dragons, and a couple of other strong female characters as well.  \n\nBoth SFD and JinP take a couple episodes to set up the story and characters, once you get past the childhood episodes it starts getting even more interesting.",

I also like how the drama grapples the more serious, even sad side of time travelling to the past when fl realises that &gt;!she's left her toddler son in the future!&lt;. So far the ml couldn't care less that he's &gt;!abandoned his duties as a dad!&lt;. oh, wait, he wasn't much of one in the first place, right?\n\nI was in a bit of a slump with Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok joo but now I'm on episode 8 and I'm really enjoying it. A huge part goes down to the chemistry between the leads, even better after I found out that they dated irl! There are really subtle facial expressions and actions the ml actor is doing whilst his character is slowly falling in love and it's just makes the drama so much better.",

Let me tell you!!! I was soooo moved by this show!!! It's an 8 episode documentary style show about t 8 artists taking up the challenge of performing one song, ONLY ONE song as the BEST performance of their lives in 1 Take. They're able to design and curate their performance to their wildest dreams (some really went for it \ud83d\ude04) to bring this once in a lifetime performance to life. After they accept the challenge by choosing that ONE song they'll sing, they're given a countdown to their performance. This concept is wild and is absolutely brilliant! But not cost effective at all lol What would you do if someone else is paying to make the performance of your life become reality?? What song would you choose that'll leave a lasting impact, stir, inspire, is a challenge and defines the artists?! You see everything from the behind the scenes process to the final performance to the rollercoaster these artists go through to prepare for this ONE TAKE! Not gonna lie I cried a couple times and once you watch you'll know why! Oh yeah *RAIN* is one of the artists. You know you've seen it... the one, with him shirtless, as cover photo on Netflix... **Take 1** highly recommend if you're into k-music/artists.",

                    "comment": "With any kind of aggregate ratings, the two most important factors to keep in mind are:\n\n* Ratings reflect general appeal. If a drama has a niche genre/subject matter, less famous actors, is older/has lower production values, etc. then the target audience is going to be smaller and the average audience more critical. TKEM is scifi/fantasy and RIABB is a noona romance, neither of which are mainstream for Kdramas in general.\n* There are two main subsets of raters: the 'I liked it, so it's a 10' and 'I hated it, so it's a 1'. The 'I liked/hated it but critically reviewed it' bunch are there (and I appreciate every single one of them), but they have little sway compared to thousands of people just clicking some stars.\n\nThe best way to use MDL to find new dramas is to identify people who've rated dramas you've love/hated similarly and/or people who write critical reviews that give a better overview of the drama and follow them.\n\nOut of the major sites, IMO MDL's ratings are some of the most accurate since it takes a wide variety of variables into account (how many times a drama has been watched/dropped/rewatched, story/acting/OST/overall, active vs past watchers, etc) and encourages in-depth reviews vs one-and-done ratings. TKEM and RIABB don't have 'bad' ratings on MDL by any stretch; 8/10 translates to 4/5 stars, which is solidly in the good-to-great range.",

I was really disappointed by that as well, because on paper it was everything I love. The first cases (fish company+school) were really good, but then it lost me. Like I said: I felt the prosecutor plot bogged down the revenge cases, and the prosecutor herself was not that interesting. And I didn't care for the female villain as well. And while the personal stories were very interesting, they felt a bit underwritten as if they just needed them to check it of their list (unpopular opinion I know)\n\nBut yes, I have high hopes for season 3. The &gt;!military scenes!&lt; suggest it will partly deal with that, which has a lot of potential &gt;!(eg. bullying, SA, the homophobic paragraph making gay relationships illegal, service dodging....)!&lt;",

Geum Jandi was one of the most annoying FLs but Gorya is very likable. The relationship also looks better because the leads have a great chemistry which was totally lacking in BoF. Seeing how F4 Thailand has become so popular I gotta give it to the writer of the original manga cause every adaptation seems to be a hit",

And let's not forget about Netflix and Disney+ that will continue to take advantage of the multi-season format to retain existing subscribers.\n\nSo happy for *Taxi Driver 2*'s success ratings-wise!\n\nAnd speaking of ratings, just wanna share this ranking of the [highest rated Korean dramas in 2022](https://rypler.com/highest-rated-korean-dramas-2022/). It's widely known that *Reborn Rich* dominated the ratings last year. JTBC is really killing it on these record-breaking shows--hello *SKY Castle* (2019) and *The World of the Married* (2020)!\n\n&gt;Dramas featuring lawyer characters led the rankings, including the top 3 among non-cable series. A lesser-known cable channel benefited from the unprecedented success of a show about an autistic rookie attorney. But a JTBC blockbuster ultimately secured the no. 1 spot as the highest rated Korean drama of 2022.\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone!",

He and Seo Hyun Jin are part of the roots of Doldam family. \n\nBut in s2, the excuse the writer had for their characters made it seem they'll come back, but its obvious that the writer and the director is done with YYS and SHJ's characters and will move forward with the AHS and LSK's characters.\n\nEdit: added words",

Not the worst daily drama out there but oh so disappointing by the end.",

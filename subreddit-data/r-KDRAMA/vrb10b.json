But you've reminded me another reason I found that scene jarring: I know Kdramas isn't reality, but I can't overlook the fact that if some girl said something to me in real life in an incomprehensible language, I'd be like \"wut\" yet in the drama he just stares blankly at her and the scene ends. So she got to \"confess\" without really confessing and he totally didn't understand her...but then we moved on I guess!&lt;",

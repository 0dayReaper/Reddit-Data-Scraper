There were satisfying resolutions, shocking moments, raw, emotional scenes, enigmatic sequences, and twists and turns which made the episodes fly by in no time at all.\n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** (2/12): A bit of an odd series, this one. It has a low-key feel for the most part, but tackles some heavy subject matter at the same time. Tonally, it shifts around quite dramatically from scene to scene. But all of this adds up to a net positive, because these elements make it different and intriguing.",

It\u2019s quite a contrast to my last drama, **Psychopath Diary**, which had no connection to reality whatsoever and which I ended up dropping despite some entertaining humor.\n\nHowever, I wish Su-ah and her mom weren\u2019t such over-the-top despicable villains. Just about every character in the show is either good or bad, with no in-between. The show is so believably realistic in most other respects (except for all the &gt;!serial killings!&lt;).",

Also on like the 8th/9th episode.\nAnd the drama has some really well done shots but more often than not I do not enjoy the cinematography, often it looks like a college students project and the audio is really bad at times that it takes you out of the drama.\n\nI also don't think that SuAh and her mom are too over-the-top despicable villains. I find them actually to be realistic characters with realistic amounts of selfishness, wanting to be best and doing anything for it. I think both characters level of evil is completely proportionate for the type of character and desires that they've got...\n\nI agree with you on the serial killings. It kinda feels out of place honestly. Since they don't always follow up on that storyline and I forget about it then I get reminded that oh yea, people are dying.",

When I mentioned quality, I wasn\u2019t just referring to the cinematography and sound (which seem fine to me, but you\u2019re probably more perceptive about those areas), but also the acting, writing, editing, pacing, and overall effect, which to me seems much classier than average. There\u2019s fewer of those cheesy things like sloppy editing that looks like they were rushing to make the air date, excessive flashback scenes to hit you over the head with some obvious point, other filler scenes, and unnecessary stylistic flourishes. Of course, there are some of these things, but much less than most dramas I\u2019ve seen. There\u2019s an overall feeling of economy and letting the story unfold naturally instead of pandering. I\u2019m probably not expressing myself very well.\n\nSu-ah and her mom make my blood boil.

I do feel like some of the romance moments are awkward but idk if it's due to the story or if it's some bias I have towards seeing older people act cutesy haha.... \n\nI get your point with letting the story fold naturally though. I think I agree with you on that too.",

The actress who plays the FL is very charismatic and it's easy to see why in the series people around her take to her. Though I found her hypocritical in the initial episodes. \n\nThe ML is attractive and fits the role of a somewhat older star actor who plays romantic roles onscreen but is a misogynist in real life. I like how they have somehow come together to make a perfect couple. \n\nSpecial mention for the actress playing Ms Choi who I think played Kim Tan's mom in Heirs. The romance of the FL's and ML's friend is unnecessary. \n\nNow unless the last episode is really bad I give it a 8/10.",

He has such good comic timing. This is not a spoiler but as the high priest, he realizes that candy helps replenish his energy. So he thinks that candy is \"tribute.\" He also doesn't know what a camera is. Usually when someone enters another world they try to hide that they don't fit in. Not here, he is basically proudly announcing his ignorance, asking for instance \"what is a camera?\" There are also lots of funny analogies that deliver some good critiques of the industry. Kpop idols and real idolatry meet in this drama. \n\nCompleted:\nCrash Course in Romance: So....the last few episodes were messy, especially the last episode. Why did they &gt;!introduce her bio mom?

I did enjoy the crime mystery aspect they touched in the second half, but apart from that I pretty much skipped on most things. The last two episodes seemed more like fillers to me. Overall it was a nice watch but not something extraordinary for me. I would rate it an 8/10.\n\n**The Crowned Clown** \\[4/16\\]: I've put this on hold for now cuz it isn't catching my attention the way I expected it to. Probably reading all the good reviews on this one made me watch this with high expectations which is why for now I've put this on hold. I'll get back to this when I feel like I can watch it with a fresh mindset. But so far it was an ok drama. Not very attention grabbing yet, but also something I'd continue watching. Definitely did enjoy YJG's acting in this one though!\n\n**Love to Hate You** \\[0/10\\]: I've watched like the first 10 mins of the first episode and it seemed fun. I don't know if I should continue watching this or not though I've only read good reviews on this drama. Maybe I should check out the first two episodes and then decide whether to continue or not.\n\n**Non-Korean**:\n\n**Haunting of the Hill House** \\[2/10\\]: I'm absolutely loving this one. It has that mystery &amp; horror parts done so beautifully. I also like the sudden time shifts, i.e., the timeline skips as the story flows because it makes me watch it with full focus and not feeling boring at a single part. Can't wait to finish this one.",

I also like the sudden time shifts, i.e., the timeline skips as the story flows because it makes me watch it with full focus and not feeling boring at a single part. Can't wait to finish this one.\n\nOoooh *The Haunting of Hill House* was such a ride, I loved it. Everyone was talking about it when it first came out, and with good reason. Very old school horror backdrop and themes, with modern elements. Really cool.",

The devil story is a bit cheesy. I'm sticking with it in hopes that I'll see WA perform and a romance develop, but not sure I will remain with this one. \n\n**Our Blooming Youth** \\- I haven't watched any more of it this week. Still on episode 5. \n\nI watched some of the Oscar movies last night and they were depressing. I wanted to \"clean my palate with a lighter watch kdrama but have not been drawn to a currently  airing one sing Crash Course in Romance. That empty feeling.... So I decided to watch **Fanletter, Please** and it was perfect!!! It's 4 episodes with Sooyoung and Yoon Park and an adorable little girl. I binged 2 episodes before I fell asleep in the wee hours of the morning. I'll watch the last 2 episodes today. \n\nAlso - I want to finish **Pachinko** this week and the second half of **The Glory.** Both are really good. Then I will tackle **Island,** that I've been waiting for since it was announced.",

While it felt like it was slowly crossing the cliche line towards the end, I didn\u2019t mind too much because the characters\u2019 journeys were satisfying. Overall, the series felt like a warm hug and a tap on the back to those who are trying.\n\n**Our Beloved Summer (16/16):** The premise was so good, but the \u201cdocumentary\u201d element felt underutilized. It gradually lost its integration to the story, occasionally being reduced to mere plot device. The story was still great though, and the performance of the two lead actors were excellent. Choi Woo-Shik was the perfect choice for his character, and I was blown away by Im Da-Mi during the emotionally heavy moments. In the scene where she confesses to grandma about her feelings, Da-Mi\u2019s acting and facial expressions truly portray a character who\u2019s aware that her source of misery is herself. This series is probably one of my favorites because of how memorable the performances were.\n\n**True Beauty (16/16):** It took me 3 episodes to realize that this series was self-aware (and to an extent satirical), and enduring the cringe was so worth it. The abundance of kdrama easter eggs and trope mockery is reason enough to watch it IMO, but it\u2019s also impressive how the depth in the characters is not lost amidst the humor. I agree with the opinions I\u2019ve read in other threads that say the writing on the characters seem grounded on parent psychology. And finally on the self-aware part: I\u2019m guessing the writers knew kdrama has a reputation for very likeable second male leads, so they wrote Han Seo-jun as &gt;!someone I would root for so much that I just got crippling sadness in the end\u2026!&lt;\n\n**The Interest of Love(12/16):** I rarely watch melodrama. Watching the decisions the leads make often gave me discomfort. But so far I\u2019m enduring it well, because there are real perspectives to explore here\u2014most of the events are contextualized with money, which I think helps to sympathize with the characters. So far I think Gyeong-pil is the most interesting character in that he, despite having a despicable history, has a blunt honesty that is tempered with genuine care for the other characters. I\u2019m hoping for a happy ending at least for the two leads, but it seems the sh*tshow will go for longer\u2026",

I also really liked seeing all the animals, though I definitely cried when &gt;!the bull had to be put down!&lt;. One thing I wasn\u2019t super fond of was &gt;!the SML being in love with the FL. I was really hoping for a strong completely platonic friendship between the two, and then the relationship drama could\u2019ve just been with the ex-girlfriend. However, I did really like how SML was adamant nothing would change, and then him and FL were able to continue to have a strong relationship afterwards!&lt;\n\n**Fanletter, Please** (4/4): this was was cute! I wasn\u2019t sold on the first episode but since it was only 4 episodes I decided to power through and I\u2019m so glad I did! I felt like the remaining three episodes were much stronger and I really loved the character growth of the FL. The ML was adorable and I loved his interactions with his daughter. \n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n**Birthcare Center** (1.5/8): I don\u2019t know about this one. I love shows about pregnancy and babies, and absolutely loved how realistically they portrayed the FL\u2019s pregnancy and then birth in the first episode. They showed all the unglamorous bits and really kind of took an axe to the fairytale pregnancy/birth/parenting that is often portrayed in shows. However, I just can\u2019t get into it. I just can\u2019t wrap my mind around how none of these parents are spending any time with their newborns at all! Like obviously I support these mothers getting all the help and pampering they can possibly get, but none of them are spending any quality time with their babies except to feed them, and the fathers are spending even less time with them! I just cannot understand it (also definitely not a knock on any parent who *can\u2019t* spend time with their baby due to various circumstances, but that\u2019s clearly not the case here) Also, I find the weird and abrupt tonal shifts very jarring. This may have to go on hold.\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** (6/16): no progress\n\n**Flower of Evil** (12/16): no progress",

Are the babies just laying in the nursery all day long and only being held when they are being nursed???? Anyway, besides that, I enjoyed it a lot. I think it's really funny and hits on lots of real issues post-partum. She spends a bit more time with her baby towards the end. However, one episode is very very sad.

I just finished **The Greatest Love**, which I actually started over two years ago, but the first episode didn't grab me. Someone in this thread (or maybe it was Late to the Party) identified it as their perfect drama, so I thought I'd give it more of a chance. I went back and watched Episode 2 (because sometimes I hate the first episode of some of my favorite dramas - looking at you Witch's Romance and Mad For You) and this time it clicked. I think it's one of the funniest dramas I've ever seen, but also one of the most touching. And the kisses...oh the kisses! Gong Hyo Jin is wonderful! I think this is my favorite performance of anything I have seen her in. Cha Seung Won's character starts out odious, and becomes so lovable. The actor does an amazing job of taking an arrogant and oblivious character and giving him heart. It's from 2011, so the cinematography is dated, but otherwise I think it's very timely. (It should be required watching for anybody who thinks that maybe being famous might be fun.) I just loved it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

A little sweeter than I would have liked tbh, but that's okay. \n\n- **He is Psychometric (9/16)** Enjoy it, but very slow getting through it.\n\n- **Revenge of Others (7/12)** Also very slow going.\n\n- **Doom at Your Service (8/16)** My first venture into Seo In Guk, and I really like him. The show is a little incoherent at times. The agreement doesn't make sense, and I'm struggling to understand the motivations of one character in particular. I'm enjoying the dynamic between the leads though and that keeps me going.\n\n- **Strangers Again (10/12)** I've been delaying the last two episodes because I've heard the ending is disappointing. \n\n- **Kokdu: Season of Deity (7/16)** Started off good but my interest is waning. I'll keep going for now.\n\n- **Island Pt 2 (2/6)** I have been lukewarm about the show since it started, and I still feel that way. Came across some spoilers for my man Cha Eun Woo though, and now I want to push through. \n\n- **Taxi Driver (12/16)** Love it. Can't wait to find out how this season ends, and then I'll probably jump right into season 2.\n\n**Non-Korean:**\n- **The Long Ballad (22/49)** Really liking this one. The tension between the leads has picked up, so I have been locked in. Saw some disappointing comments about the PDA though, so that's lowered my excitement by quite a bit. \n\n\n- **Have a Crush on You (5/36)** I shouldn't have started this one tbh, but I saw a clip from it that made me want to start it right away. Not loving it so far, so I might put it on hold until I've finished a few of the other shows.",

            "comment": "**Once Upon a Small Town** (8/12): Really enjoying this sweet series! After recently finishing *A Piece of Your Mind*, I need a lighter watch with lots of humour and great chemistry. I love the shorter episodes,  small town vibes, with a great cast, funny animals and children, and solid love story.  \n\n\n**A Piece of Your Mind** (12/12)**:** I thought the premise sounded interesting with an AI theme, but the writers didn't pursue the sci-fi element at all so you need suspension of disbelief to make this series work plot-wise. The cinematography was lovely and the soundscape was great, but the story honestly dragged on for me. I was using the skip function a lot to just get through the last 5 or 6 episodes. The whole series hinged on one person's reticence, which is my least favourite K-Drama trope. The whole problem could have been solved with one adult conversation.   \n\n\n**Goblin** (1.5/10): So far, this one is really intriguing. I'm enjoying the fantasy elements, and the characters are great, especially the FL, who just eats up the screen. But I'm super weirded out by the age difference between the leads. How is it okay to fetishise a high school girl with a 35 year old man? It helps me to know the actors were both of age during filming, but the sight of a young girl in her school uniform with a grown man is triggering af.  \n\n\n**Healer** (20/20): ADORED everything about this show. I can see why it's people's number 1 drama - the chemistry between the actors is off-the-charts. ML is too dreamy, with such a wide range of expressive sides, from funny to angsty to affectionate to badass. And FL was 100% adorable, sassy, tender. The side roles were great too, even the bad guys. But most of all, the plot was fantastic. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat and I was genuinely sad it came to an end.",

            "comment": "**The Glory Part 2** (ep 5/8) Idk... It's not bad, but I don't love it either. Most characters in this show are either absolutely awful or completely pure. I think that **The King of Pigs** did a much better job at portraying a bullying revenge story while adding some nuance (&gt;!bully regretting the bullying, bullied friends betraying each other!&lt;) and that without sacrificing the entertanment value.^(It is such a great show. I wish it was more widely known.) But, to be fair, I don't think that The Glory aims to give a nuaced take on bullying. I think that the show aims more at making the viewer so angry at the enemy, that it feels cathartic to see them go down. \n\nUnfortunately, most of the time, these type of stories are not my cup of tea.\u00a0 Maybe that is why I have so many mixed feelings about this drama. \n\nOne thing I really like about The Glory is that the main character plays her enemies into &gt;!taking out each other!&lt;. I am invested in seeing how it ends, but I still think that the show would've faired better with fewer episodes, as at times it feels overstretched.\u00a0 Idk, maybe I will change my mind when everything will come together.\n\n\nI really like **The Heavenly Idol** (8/12) though. It it so increadibly silly and adorable. It just throws the most random stuff of the viewer, but after setting my suspension of disbelief to the maximum, I am really enjoying it. While there are some explanations that are given to justify the plot, I am more content to giggle at the silliness of every plot point. I am waiting every week to see what will be the next thing thrown at us and will miss the show when it ends. \n\nRewatch \n\n**Mr. Queen** (16/20) : Yes, yes yes. Watching the 2nd time and enjoying it as much as the first! Such a fun ride. This time around, I am planning to watch the 4 special episodes too.",

As I said, I don't think  that The Glory is a bad show. A lot of people seem to enjoy it and it has many interesting elements, but I don't like it's approach as much.\n\nWhat really gets to me is that so many characters are so unequivocally evil, that they seem cartoonish. And this can work in some instances. For example, **Happiness** has many evil characters, but it serves as a juxtaposition to \"zombies\", who are mostly decent in their human form. Imo, it is a clever commentary on many levels. For example, that people trapped in a dangerous situation can be worse than the danger itself. \n\nHere, so many characters are devoid of humanity for so long, that it turned up my suspension of disbelief a notch. At this point, I stopped connecting with the characters or taking what is happening seriously, but I still enjoy the style and the logic behind the revenge. I just wish it had one or two fewer episodes, so the action was more condensed. But, I wouldn't say that the she show isn't worth a shot.",

KOP and Happiness does better with giving this concept depth and complexity, in the storytelling AND characters, whereas The Glory has just as a solid storytelling as those two, but lacks character depth all-around (and maybe just depth in general), thus making it not much of a compelling commentary on humanity and evil as it sets out to be",

The random ML+friends moments are some of the best character building scenes I've seen in a long while... but they're doing some heavy lifting. Still, it takes a lot for me to drop a CSW project and it's lightyears better than Sisyphus so...\n\n**Big Bet S2**. (1/8) Lee Dong Hwi posted some spoilers on his IG and now I'm scared to continue. Jungpal!! \n\nFinished **Island S2**. I think I liked it? More like I liked the concept and world building and character design. The story was pretty standard as far as Save the Girl, Save the World plots go. the chemistry between the ML+FL was nice. overall it felt like a nice wide shallow pool. lots of cool stuff but not too much depth. \n\nnothing else in kdramaland is catching my eye. I took a dip in the jdorama pool - liked Dearest a lot but the first half was better than the second. and was super meh on Full-time Wife Escapist. the both sides hiding their feelings part was good but the overall preachiness was unbearable. at some points it felt like Sesame Street for adults teaching people how to be nice as if they had the learning capacity of 5 year olds.\n\nalso whoever at Netflix is giving feedback about english titles... i know apparently we're opposed to literal translations (why tho). but please. just because words may grammatically fit together, doesn't mean they make good titles....",

            "comment": "Completed:\n\n* **The Glory Part 2 (8/8)** \u2014 Hot take, but I did not like this drama, which was unexpected to me cause I wanted to. It also has Lee Do Hyun, one of my favorite actors. I thought I would like it. What mostly got to me was the flat acting of the FL. Main characters are important in getting you hooked to the story, but she did nothing for me. At first, I gave the excuse that the character herself is never smiling because of the circumstances. It's addressed in the drama. But then emotional scenes would come, and her face showed nothing. It pulls me out of the drama and it made her character implactless for me. I did like the villains, though. I did ever since part 1, and I still do. Without them, this drama would be uninteresting. Another thing I disliked was the romance. It sucked. Didn't want it, and no one asked for it. Another thing is the pacing. I was so disappointed when part 2 started cause it felt empty when we were promised revenge in part 1. Then when the revenge came, it didn't feel fitting or right? It didn't satisfy me, and it felt like a loooot of plot points had no payoff. 5/10. That 5 is for the ahjumma and Ha Do Young. I don't personally recommend it, though.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Vincenzo (18/20)** \u2014 Wow, were the last few episodes thrilling. I say this every once in a while when I watch dramas, but Vincenzo might be one of my favorite kdrama characters. I wanted to say favorite, but that's not true. 18 Again and Weightlifting Fairy leads are some of my favorites. But I looove how exciting this drama is. The leads are killing it. Song Joong Ki, Jeon Yeo Bin, Taecyeon, and Kwak Dong Yeon. Brilliant acting. I'm also watching Young Actors' Retreat, and I can see so much of KDY's personality in this character. I also love the Geumga Plaza people. They're such a great group who are entertaining to watch, especially when they get involved in the main plot. The over-the-top shenanigans they get into with the main characters are the best. And can I mention the OST? I think once I finish the drama, I'll listen to it because it's that good.\n* **Kingdom Season 2 (3/6)** \u2014 Things are both getting together and also making me sad. I really like this drama, maybe not a lot, but it's a great zombie drama. I think this is an accurate description that I heard: Kingdom is Game of Thrones done right. The supernatural aspect, anyway.\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (13/16)** \u2014 Can't believe only an episode came out this week. As if I need an extra week of Kokdu. No, thanks.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (6/16)** \u2014 Cause it's been more than a week since last episode, it feels like the drama is coming out at a snail's pace. However, I liked this episode. The case was handled okay (again, not as great as S1, but I'll settle with okay) and the kids are cute. Also, I think everyone saw the ending of the episode coming. \n* **Our Blooming Youth (11/20)** \u2014 I'll watch the 12th today, but my goodness is this drama slooow. It's a chore getting through it. I'll endure for Park Hyung Sik, but man is it hard. It's that type of drama where I don't pay attention and I feel like I missed nothing. It's a shame cause I think PHS fits the crown prince role so well.",

The only time she emoted was the one time she cried in the penultimate episode. \n\nShe has never been a good actress. She always relies on the male lead to do the emotionally hefty work eg, This Winter The Wind Blows and Encounter. The first kdrama I watched was This Winter The Wind Blows so I always have a soft spot in my heart for her because she was so delicate, fragile and pretty. But facts are facts. She has coasted on her looks her entire career and her costars are always more interesting than her in any show she\u2019s in. The bromance between the male lead and his best friend made Descendants of the Sun, Park Bo Gum and Cuba made Encounter and Rain made Full House worth while. \n\nThe Glory role used her flat, dead-inside affect to its best extent because the character is traumatized to numbness and needs the revenge to become whole. The costars carried the show because even after her revenge was complete she was still lifeless.",

While I like the romance and KJH is hard carrying, plot is a lot of things and nothing well developed, same can be said for the FL, which had 0 growth even if ISH is doing her best and chemistry is there. Watchable, albeit nothing to be amazed by;\n\n\\- **Delivery Man (5/12):** same as the previous one, here with the FL, an active Minah, running the show while the ML offers not much and plot still has no precise direction, with stand-alone cases and a background mystery that has a lot to patch up. Fun moments and a bit of dark comedy, but nothing more than average so far.\n\nWith the sole **Divorce Attorney Shin** to add soon and no new drama I'm longing for, it might be time to shed off backlogs or find whatever hidden gem escaped me.",

I dislike this trope, because it does not give rise to true equality between the classes, but reinforces the idea that some people are born deserving. \n\n\n------------\n\nIn other news, I have almost finished **Dr Park's Clinic**, which is surprisingly  heartwarming, but I need a break from the cringe humour of watching them do things I just know will go wrong. Will soon watch the last part. The wife was at first written as a stupid stereotype (greedy and stupid), but has been shown to have more qualities, and actually loves her husband. The stupidity affects the husband too, who &gt;!should tell her how is economy really is!&lt;. Only 12 half hour episodes \u2013 which is about what I can take. For the dramatically challenged, it doesn't fulfil many challenges. Just the reverse trope with the umbrella, and probably some of the actor challenges. But they ate tteokkbokki!",

Though I wasn't really spoiled, I had seen comments that made me think I might have problems with the plot eventually, but that hasn't happened. I just find it very easy to watch. Often I have issues when a focus is on students, finding them too whiney for my taste, but it doesn't bother me here. This was my first time seeing Jeon Do-Yeon and I'm a fan! Though I like Jung Kyoung-Ho in general, I'm beginning to think he uses the same style to portray all the characters I've seen. I've only seen him in PP, HP, CLOY (don't remember him in CLOY, though) and this one. Not a diss, just wondering to myself if I should watch his other dramas to check this out.\n\nMy previous drama was While You Were Sleeping and I think it's funny how many of those actors appear in CCIR.",

Kim Ji Seok (whom I\u2019m familiar with through Monthly Magazine Home with Jung So Min) is good as the SML too but I don\u2019t understand why &gt;! he even married Jessica and had a baby with her in the first place. It seems implausible that she would want to have a kid, and they seem wildly incompatible\u2014surely he knew how self-centered and immature she was before they got married? Scratching my head over this one. !&lt;\n\nNon-Kdrama: I recently finished **The Summer I Turned Pretty** and enjoyed the moms\u2019 storylines over the teenagers. I truly don\u2019t get why anyone would get romantically involved with **major spoilers** &gt;! two brothers. Wtf, Belly?! And why would Conrad be okay with kissing her after he knows she\u2019s been hooking up with Jeremiah?! !&lt;",

I love the chemistry between all the characters. I know it\u2019s still early, but I am having to pace myself with this one, it is so hard to do.",

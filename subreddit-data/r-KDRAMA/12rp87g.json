Pending any potential betrayal from the police team (which I HOPE doesn't happen!!!!! just mentionning it because it could very well be something they throw as a bad plot twist), everything is fairly straight forward, the pace is fast, people's goals are clear and it's just a fun romp.\n\nIt's not super deep but screw it, it doesn't need to be.",

I love it whenever Hwang Dae Myung does stuff that make people think he's a complete doofus lol\n\nThe police trio is lovely! After Reborn Rich I really wanted to see Jo Han Chul (the police captain) in a good-guy role. And I was wondering where I'd seen Lee Joo woo (the FL) before and she was in Welcome to Waikiki! The youngest of the trio is an oddly charming character. We haven't seen a lot of him but I like that he's not just the typical \"hard-working rookie with a heart of gold\".",

Main plot line: recovering cultural artifacts -&gt; Police squad can't do it cause that's breaking the law -&gt; team up with a super thief to get cultural artifacts and solving murders about the coins. Literally nearly same plot for every heist kdrama. Pretty straightforward however this one has more comedic elements in it.",

Additionally, Deadpool is a 24/7 character, whereas the MC shifts between the two. In my view, however, these sorts of shifts only work if the audience isn't aware that it's the same person. Taecyeon's character in Vincenzo is what I would consider a good execution of the concept. I see no point in the MC we're following using that system. Other shows and movies that have the undercover life trope typically still have the MC being very competent rather than being a fool. There's no reason for me to see him acting like a fool because I already know he's pretending. Take one of the more recent scenes where he's in the auction. What's the point of me seeing him sweating and being worried about the auction? I already know he's faking it, so why should I care about that?",

In addition you can say that the same with taxi driver. Most of his undercover cases he's literally trolling and acting dumb just like Skunk. However when he's with his close friends and allies he's serious, competent, and joking around with them. Just like how Skunk is with that lady. What is disjointed about the series can you tell me?",

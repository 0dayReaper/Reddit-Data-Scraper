There's a great scene in the first episode where he's dropping current wife (once KSA's best friend) off at airport.  They are both flight attendants.  He looks up to see KSA getting off the bus and starts muttering about how she should be wearing a coat.  Wife is touched until she realizes he's watching HER.",

I can't believe kanghoo has involvement, I'm so curious why he's so sus. It seems like he's the mastermind of everything. I'm thinking if it's something to do with yoona or some long-term revenge he has been plotting based on their history, or he truly is also money hungry and used the four girls as pawns to beat off je hyeok and take over everything !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngosh this show is just too good and so underrated, really wished more people watched it.",

He has nothing in the world that he is scared about and he has many things he loves. He is excellent in playing basketball. His friend Go Joon Hee (Jo Joon Young) attends the same high school. Go Joon Hee\u2019s academic score is always at the top of his school. He is physically weak and he had a kidney transplant from Go Yoo. Since then, Go Joon Hee suffers from cellular memory syndrome (memories transferred through cells from an organ transplant).\n&gt;\n&gt;Go Yoo and Go Joon Hee then fall in love with a transfer student Han So Yeon (Jang Yeo Bin) at the same time. Han So Yeon is pretty and smart, but she has a secret that causes her to keep a distance from others.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/All_That_We_Loved)",

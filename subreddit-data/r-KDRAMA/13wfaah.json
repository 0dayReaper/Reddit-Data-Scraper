He's truly one of the best or even the best among his contemporaries right now. The first time I saw him was when he played a 40 yo man in the body of a 18 yo also the father of twins. Now his role in TGBM also a father of twins but not a trace of similarity. Insane range if you ask me. Hope this week's episode makes me cry less and smile more.",

Not just that one moment in ep 10 when he asked why everything must happen her way. Even the adoption thing has now been framed as a ploy to protect her from the bad guys. Even as a child, he understood why she did what she did. For everything that she made him go through he, at the very least, deserves a chance to vocalise how she hurt him. It doesn't look like the show intends to do that.\n\nSam-Sik really annoyed me this episode. C'mon you must know you don't have it in you to deal with those people.

Mijoo is prohibiting KH from getting married and it\u2019s not like Mijoo is even a possible candidate to marry him as she is \u201cmarried\u201d herself and also has kids whom YS believes is with another man. So I guess logically she would be angry that Mijoo is preventing KH from getting married especially when she went through so many rejections and finally found the one who would willingly marry KH the way he is, only to lose her due to Mijoo\u2026 !&lt;\n\nIt was definitely uncalled for and &gt;! Mijoo\u2019s mother rightfully came for and out her in her place afterwards !&lt;. Cause if we are taking in all the facts as people who actually know what is going on in this cluster of misunderstandings, it\u2019s obvious &gt;! it was KH who ruined Mijoo life\u2019s. So for YS to say Mijoo ruined his life is so ironic and entitled of her. Gets me mad even thinking about it. Everything Mijoo has been through just to hear that from the grandmother of her kids, !&lt;despicable tbh. \n\nSamSik - honestly not really that annoyed with him, &gt;! yes he ruined the piece of evidence but I feel like him showing it to KH helped him with his memory that ultimately led to him gaining him memory rn so I am thankful. And from what it seems like in the preview of the next episode he helps Mijoo find out more about why KH left her and also somewhat helps Mijoo believe KH isn\u2019t a mother and baby killer\u2026\nAlso I don\u2019t think that piece of evidence could have proved KH was innocent anyways it\u2019s just some dirt on Taesoo so would have just brought Taesoo down but not helped KH up either !&lt;",

Then it begs the question of why he was given so much screen time in Episodes 5 &amp; 6... to no useful end.\n* Detective Ye-jin might have just saved the day. And Mi-joo's deduction from her previous interaction with Ha-young was a classic twist that we've come to associate with this filmmaker. You know it's coming when that guitar soundtrack kicks in...\n* A great deal of narrative progress was made in this episode, leaving ample time for a satisfactory resolution to the series next week.

What can make a good mother bad is how desperately they want their children to live well that it makes them blind to how they go about it. Balancing what you want against what your child wants is the ultimate challenge but the love that drives that is what helps you both appreciate the connection you have (unless you're chairman oh). That heart to heart between Mi-joo and Ye-jin was my favourite moment of the show.\n\nThey do so well with balancing all the light-hearted, emotional and serious moments. Nearly spit my food out with the fly kick to start the episode and our resident farmers So and Cha giving us that hero entrance was perfection. Do hyun delivered one of my favourite performances of his so far today and can't wait to see &gt;!OG Kang-oh complete the revenge arc.!&lt;\n\nEP12: I don't think I've cried from so many conflicting emotions of laughter, happiness, relief, forgiveness and pain like this. This show really understands it's tone and I love that they aren't afraid to dive into the light heartedness whenever they want. From Sam-sik's goofiness to Mi-joo matching his energy, everyone enjoying the moment and Kang-oh fully set on his path. Can't wait to get more satisfaction next week.\n\nAnd just want to say that Ahn Eun-jin would absolutely kill in a rom-com role.",

Lol. \n\nAnyway, having said that, overall the show\u2019s writing has had its weak parts and so does the editing, but last week\u2019s episodes were really good I thought and today\u2019s hopefully is setting up the last 3. Mi-Joo and her kids continue to be the heart and soul of the show, whilst we grapple with the others being heavily grey. I\u2019m glad YS could at least admit that she hasn\u2019t actually changed as a person because that\u2019s so evident. LDH is fantastic in his role and it will be very very fascinating to see him now switch back to the very grey yet kinda bad ass vendetta driven Kang-Ho of the past decade. In an ideal world I wouldn\u2019t want anything more than to see him live happily ever after with Mi-Joo and the kids, but I\u2019m sure reality is going to look very different. Either way, I\u2019m with Ye-Jin on this one\u2026Mi-Joo needs to only focus on her life and happiness now.",

He thinks highly of himself, throws his weight around and sells a load of lies about his success and clout to all of childhood friends. So, he's, basically, the worst kind of Seoulite ... a condescending, vacuous fraud; something that he, eventually, has to admit to everyone including himself. \n\nWhich, in the story, makes him (and the gangsters) ... a threat and a contrasting foil to the plainly not glamorous but genuine, people of substance living in the country.\n\nI may well have missed something else but his purpose certainly includes these things.",

It's very difficult to have any trust in Sam-sik, given his history, but I hope he can come through for Kang-ho in this instance.\n* \"His eyes are kind, just like cow eyes.\" But the village chief's wife could see right through Woo-byeok's assistants. A few scenes later, they showed how deadly garden tools can be when wielded by professionals.\n* Ha-young came through for Kang-ho in a sense, but Tae-soo is well and truly out of control at this point.\n* Ye-jin's monologue was yet another incredible scene performance by Ki So-yu.\n* &gt;!Losing the farm and the pigs!&lt; a second time took me back to Episode 7, when the misery being piled on just felt too much.

That he was with another woman for so long, even if it was for revenge. Seven years is a long time and takes a lot of intimacy\u2026 maybe he never loved her, still.\n\nEdit: I think they were dating for about 7 years because when MJ ran into them coincidentally, the twins were babies. And the guys that were talking about them said \u201che made it\u201d and they wonder why would a rich and successful woman, would date him since he has no connections or riches. And the other guy said he was obsessed with her ever since uni (or something like that). So, in that scene my understanding is they were together.

Though tbh, I think the twins are only 5? \n\nAges in Korean shows throw me off because they\u2019re using Korean age, which generally adds two years to the actual birth age. So, though the show says the twins are 7, they\u2019re 7 in Korean age and 5 in international age. Another clue is that they\u2019re not in school, so they can\u2019t be 7. \n\nIn any case, Kang Ho still spent 5 years with a woman he didn\u2019t love to take revenge on her dad. That\u2019s insane.\n\n(But, timeline wise, maybe not even 5 years.?\nThey probably didn\u2019t date right after he booked her for the fake drug charges. And then her dad had them break up for a bit too. So like, let\u2019s say it took 6 months to date and then another 6 month break. He STILL dated her for 4 years. That\u2019s unforgivable lmao)",

His bother was older and was dating one of them (his brother was 25 and was dating the 16 year old). He ended up in an orphanage and hated them, but particularly the girl that had an affair with his brother. Since he was 12 he had been plotting his revenge, and when he became about 30, and had the his ways, he went after them introducing himself like someone else. \n\n(Needless to say, he fell for his brother\u2019s ex, and she fell for him, and they had the most messed up, complex and most passionate love story ever.)\n\nThis obsession for revenge, and the dedication no matter what the cost (his mental, emotional, physical health and everything in between), reminds me of this MMC. \n\nI get downvoted for this, but that\u2019s why I always say that YS has no idea how much she has broken KH. The damage she has caused is beyond her understanding. To get revenge, he dropped everything and everyone he loved, become someone he disliked, doing something he hated and he never wanted to be to begin with. Her love so conditional, she wired him to be this way ever since birth. He never had a chance to be himself, it was never good enough, so instead he became who she wanted.",

The same goes for Sam Shik\u2019s parents casually brushing off their parenting style as a means to protect him. \n\nI\u2019ve honestly been most impressed with the way Mi-Joo\u2019s character has been written. What a strong, kind and caring girl. Those kids are so darn lucky to have her as their mother! \n\nThat scene of &gt;!Kang Ho hugging the kids and apologizing for not recognizing them had me totally tear up!&lt;.

I sympathized so much with her when she said she couldn\u2019t even hate him or kill now because he suffered more than she did!&lt;. I love that despite YS telling her that &gt;!he didn\u2019t abandon her but rather himself (which was a brilliant dialogue by itself) she continued to acknowledge that she was in fact abandoned by him.!&lt;\u2026reasons for actions don\u2019t change the actual action. \n\nCan\u2019t wait for next week because it looks like the young generation decide to take matters into their own hands and indulge in shenanigans. \n\nHow mature also of Mi-Joo to say &gt;!Ha Young and Kang Ho probably needed a moment!&lt;.

            "comment": "I know I'm in the minority but I felt that the scene where the ML  finds out about the children and also the scene with Migoo was so unsatisfying and underwhelming.. (especially considering this is a series that deals with so much emotions and has heartbreaking scenes)\n\nI was really upset that the ML hears about his children through a conversation between Migoo and his mother, behind a curtain and there was no conversation in which Migoo simply tells him.\n\nConsidering that his character is very sensitive throughout the series- we didn't get to see almost any of it (except for a few tears and a shock that lasted two seconds) the storm of emotions that such a revelation should ignite. Feelings of guilt, regret, shame for his behavior, the loss for the lost time, etc.\n\nThere was none of that. When he came to talk to Migoo he was already collected and the conversation between them was as if they were talking about something from seventy years ago and not something new that is happening now.\n\nMigoo, who is capable of conveying so many emotions to me, her response was superficial here (emotionally). And she forgave him so easily that I can't believe it.\n\nHow did he suffer more than her? It was his decision to go his own way...And is this even a competition of who suffered more? How she didn't accus him: Why didn't you tell me you were going to do so and so? why did you leave me in the dark?\n\nSomething about their whole conversation was very underwhelming for me.\n\nWhere are his pleas that he is sorry (and not saying I will come back and beg for your forgiveness) but spending five minutes sharing how he feels terrible for what he did and that he will spend his whole life asking for forgiveness, or mention the children and say that he wants to be a part of their lives (and not make assumptions that he simply can after his behavior) or mention them at all etc...\n\nThere were so many touching conversations in this series, between the son and the mother, between the son and Migoo that moved me so much more (two examples that come to mind, the conversation where he tells her that his mother abended him on him and she tells him that she was also abandoned... and another scene where he He tells her that his mother did not abandon him and he is sure that she was not abandoned by that person either, etc.).\n\nJust so much  disappointment in  both scenes (for me of course).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this quote... \"the only thing he ever abandoned was himself... \"Sorry, he may have abandoned himself (by choice) but he definitely abandoned Migo\u05dd as well (knowingly because he already knew when he studied law where all this was going and that  he meant to carry out revenge) but the fact that he abandoned himself does not negate the fact that he also abandoned Migoo.\n\nIt can be both and not either or. I didn't like the fact that the mother just overlooked it and Migoo also accepted this version and suddenly the abandonment was forgotten. I'm not saying she should have held a grudge forever, but also not let it slide so quickly which is what I felt she did (only because he suffered more. ) What a pile of bullshit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I haven't even started on the fact that the series suddenly took on a completely different tone and suddenly turned into a comic crime drama - it seems to me that this vibe will dominate the atmosphere until the end of the series and that also makes me very upset. This unrelated lightness.\n\nEnd of a a very long rant:)",

The moment when both the ajummas cried hugging each other broke my heart. I love female friendships!\n\nWhen Kang-ho's mom asked him to sing the kdrama fangirl in me thought he's gonna get flashbacks to him singing for Mi-joo and end up running towards her house, just like **Hyun Bin** does in **Secret Garden** lol. But it was very beautiful to see Mi-joo singing the same song to a sick Ye-jin. The kids are very much the highlight of the show cause how did that lil kid say such profound things and make me shed a tear?\n\nI was very annoyed by the &gt;!fire accident!&lt;! in the end because Young-soon couldn't catch a break at all but if that's what it takes to bring &gt;!Kang-ho's memories back!&lt; then I'm all in.\n\nI'm so excited for tomo cause Young-soon &gt;!learns the truth about Mi-joo!&lt; and I can't wait!",

There was way too much time spent on side plots that went nowhere (the singer, Sam Sik). Kang Ho regaining his memory should have been a HUGE deal and they just glossed over it and moved on. And no one is supposed to know he got his memories back but he is running all over Korea looking for evidence like ??? \n\nThere is a point to be made about how revenge can ruin your life and can't change the past, which is where I thought this show was going, but it looks like we're going to get a \"justice for dad\" story.

He can even get that in assumed name, since he had resources to get fake passport. This is just lazy writing. Sam sik just losing dna test, without making a copy. Same with the audio recording- although not sure if backup was made. The mother burning evidence, still understandable, although reckless.\n\nThe best character of all time is mi joo. There is no debate. \n\nI feel like drama could've benefitted from lesser episodes. The pacing is off. There are unnecessary side characters, like that music guy. Finally the most interesting part, three of them working together is going to be there next week, but it is going to be only one episode. I wouldn't mind to watch that for 3 4 episodes.\n\nThe mother too much of a volatile subject for me to even comment on.",

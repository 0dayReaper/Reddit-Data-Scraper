    "postText": "The FMC's name in *Secret Garden* is 'Gil Ra-Im'. That's what everyone calls her up to episode 9.\n\nIn episode 10, the MMC and the FMC's roommate are suddenly calling her '**Gil Taeng-ja**'.\n\nWhat does this mean?",

There is a character in Lovers in Paris named Kim Taeng-ja, so Hyun Bin's character must be treating Ra-Im, like she's Taeng-ja. \n\nHope that makes sense.",

Why would 50 kill her father? Which would lead to the question who hired 50? What actually happens at the mental hospital? Why is 50 called 50, implying many more?\n\nInstead, she is playing stupid games &gt;!kiddnapping the daughter of the woman that sniped her father!&lt; and going to all the trouble to invite Taera on tv to ask the least important question. Which also doesn't make sense because if Haesoo believes the tip, there is more than enough reason to believe &gt;!Taera is 50!&lt; i understand wanting to confim, but it's the follow up questions that intersting and important. By asking on a talk show, she has practically guaranteed she won't get an answer to any question, much less the questions that would let her get to the bottom of who killed her father.",

Haesoo is just going to get herself killed with all that emotions controlling her. \n\nShe should have thought that 15 years ago, No. 50 was just around high school age and couldn't have murdered the president on her own. \n\nLooking for the mastermind should have been her ultimate goal. Or maybe she wanted to rile the mastermind up by grilling No. 50 on her show. But either ways, she's still stupid.",

Did you think a picture of a girl was enough evidence to accuse someone of being an assassin on tv? Would have been nice &gt;!if she had tried to gather the evidence before the show, not after!&lt;\n\nI just can't with Haesoo's character. She needs to smarten up or die.",

I suppose the doll that Yura left with the child will be a major puzzle piece.!&lt;\n\nThis show is well-crafted but I'm afraid that in the end, there will be some sort of big reveal that 1/2 of what we have witnessed was all created by a neuro-patch or whatever (starting with some of Taera's memories) and therefor much of it was meaningless to the final resolution.

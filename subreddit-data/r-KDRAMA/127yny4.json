There are always several scenes where the characters are eating.  I don't think you see that in western dramas.  Usually, just a scene where food is laid out, mostly untouched, obviously serving as a prop for a conversation.\n\nYou sense the cultural importance that eating has through such attention.  And so many of their words and expression convey that importance too.",

Gotta throw a wee bit of kudos to Park Yu-Seok when he said they didn't realize how much MCS loved DTH.!&lt;\n\nBut that whole scene between PYS and Jin Yeong-Ju &gt;!was 100% a precursor to the scene later on. Obviously at the time we don't know it's coming but I thought \"oooh Jin Yeong-Ju you are skating on thin ice\", this guy could take you down with what he did/knows about Ju-Hwa's divorce (and possible death). And then later on her father in law basically fires her and calls her the bad apple and shameless!&lt;. Her days are numbered but I still don't trust her and what she might do.\n\nThe camping trip - I love these camping trips and then the whole conversation with Grandma, who's back from her surgery. I love how she compliments and insults each of them. &gt;!Not surprised that they're moving slowly forward with the potential romance between So-Yeon and Hyeong-Geun - I wonder how far we'll get before the series ends.!&lt;\n\nI kind of suspected &gt;!that Seo-Jin will leave the law office (although she might stay) and go back to broadcasting - streaming might be good although based on that \"fan\" encounter after the team dinner, it could also be very risky. But love that she met her son on his walk home from school and then took him shopping. The scene in the store when they were talking about being out with each other was much needed. !&lt;\n\nChoi Jun - &gt;!such a great character, his subtle way of digging in the Heart Waves group and finding out info on the sketchy af Park Hyeon-Tae, the casual drilling of PHT during the mediation, the fight scene and then the drinking while live streaming and then falling asleep !&lt;(Jung Kook fans can relate!!). I don't mean this in a bad way at all, but doe Han Eun-Sung remind anyone else of Ok Taecyeon - not necessarily in looks but a combo of his acting/looks.\n\nOnly three episodes left - bummer. \n\nOMG I just remembered the whole &gt;!haemorrhoid scene!&lt; at the team dinner - I feel like the writers really nailed that friendship between Shin, Hyeong-Geun and Jeong-Sik.",

They're doing such a great job in portraying a long time friendship. And they're just so much fun to watch. The &gt;!whole dividing up the crab, planning out HG's camping trip, hiding while at the same camping site ... which you know they had to get there first! Oh the whole \"mellow with marshmallows\" - I need that on a tee.!&lt;\n\nLove how supportive and sneaky So-Yeon &gt;!was with the people dining in her shop - if you like and leave a supporting comment the ramyeon will be on the house. !&lt;\n\nMrs Ma - &gt;!all those years of covering up her husband's affairs just to keep his image and the company's image clean - she is very much due her fair share of the money. But I am thinking the same as Shin at the end - too easy - something is brewing.!&lt;\n\nI swear to everyone &gt;!that if it comes out that Yeong-Ju is starving Gi-Yeong - I will rage!! The way Mr. Jang was watching him eat \"snacks\", he knows something is up ... those weren't snacks, they were a full on meal. And Gi-Yeong was shoving them down like he had eaten in days. Plus at the end, showing up to Shin's office pleading for help.!&lt;\n\nYeong-Ju will get her comeuppance and so will Park Yu-Seok. &gt;!Although I still feel like PYS will use what he has on Yeong-Ju in relation to Ju-Hwa's divorce and death. I don't think he's the type to go down without a fight. !&lt;And Yeong-Ju thinks she's clever but she's not that clever.\n\nI feel like the last two episodes are going to be a lot more on the tense side with only small snippets of laughs (from the bromance and So-Yeon). This series has gone by so fast, can't believe that next weekend is the last two episodes.\n\n&gt;!Oh, I wasn't too surprised that the person leaving the horrible comments on Seo-Jin's channel is young!&lt; \\- it will be interesting to see if that storyline continues at all, given that there's only two episodes left.",

Even though it worked in a way for the farmer guy, that Vietnamese lady was too despicable to have such nice ending. At least the cleaner lady's MIL had remorse for her actions but the Vietnamese lady only came back when she had played all her cards and was left in a corner. I feel bad for the farmer, he must be having conflicting emotions. \n\nChoi jun's mediation scene was hilarious. I esp loved the judge's warning looks, he was very comedic. \n\nGlad the step mom was put to her place. \n\nOne thing didn't quite fit. I might have missed something or there was continuity error. On the wedding day, ssh teased his sister for falling head over heels for her lover and suddenly marrying him, implying they were in a relationship. During the tea time with the cool MIL, he said that juwa begged him to convince their parents not to marry her off, implying it was an arranged marriage and she was against it. During the scene with step mom and cool MIL, step mom said everything was her's from the beginning and she had to take a detour because the cool mil didn't approve her as dil, implying she was having an affair with him. To make things fit in, I guess ssh was only blabbering in the first example. \n\nAnyway, during flashback scene of jjs and lawyer park, jjs said that daenum fired everyone who took juwa's case, implying juwa must have done something very terrible that the in laws who took her in themselves were so against her. It's pretty obvious that the step mom set everything up so I can't wait to see the daenum family's reaction once the truth comes out. Step mom is going to be fried alive. \n\nI enjoyed this episode despite being 80% filler. Oh I finally realized who is lsj's son's lookalike, he is like a mini version of c-actor Bai jingting.",

Atty Shin mocked her at the wedding saying she was never interested in marriage before meeting him and he followed it up with the conversation with MIL that their father was always pestering her to get married before that and she needed him to back her up and keep their father at bay, but he told her to handle it herself which he sorely regrets.\n\nAs far as the evil step mother is concerned I think she was always in the picture somehow before Ju Hwa's marriage to Jong Kook but was not approved of by MIL and possibly FIL so she did what is normal is K dramas and seduced him.  She then found a way to get him to divorce Ju Hwa and get custody of their son using her status and money via Atty Park as her tool.   Just my take anyway.  As the episodes progress more explanations will hopefully be fleshed out.",

It's the same as mine.\n\nAlthough, I am not sure if custody was ever on the table, so I am still waiting to see what happened.  With the mother dead, of course, custody will go to the father.  Who else has any claim?  Certainly not the uncle.\n\nAlthough, with the surprise visit of his nephew, who knows what will be revealed?  He says in the preview. I have no one on my side.\n\nAnyway.

Loved though how FIL is playing chess with her.  While they both lack any sense of moral fiber, in this case I like that where she is concerned he has the upper hand.\n\nFor sure I thought when Gi-Yeong asked Driver Jung to drop him off for a late night snack, he was going to run off then.

His mother totally loved the child and was devastated that he was taken away.  He said to Shin at one point, that all that was left for her was to lock herself in the house and die (paraphrased).  He also wanted and loved the child.  When she came back, it wasn't her, he welcomed, but the baby.  The whole divorce case was mostly about the child I think, otherwise he would have let her go.\n\nFor her part, she didn't get that good of an outcome.  She lost her baby daddy, which ironically was orchestrated by the bad lawyers.  No doubt she planned to get alimony from him while she lived with her lover in Vietnam.  \n\nIn the end, she was exposed and humiliated.  Pretty sure that all those favours she was getting from the farmer are going to dry up now.  To throw her a bone, it might be that she was being influenced by her lover and that away from his influence, she might start appreciating her new life more.\n\nIn the end, it was the best outcome for the people who deserved it.",

Or else they can rot in hell. \n\nThe Vietnamese lady (vl) satisfies none. She didn't have any gratitude and did everything purely for her selfish needs. Lsj, the professor and khg's wife's reasons for cheating were understandable (not justifiable btw) as they were emotionally starved. It can be argued that the vl's lover lured her but I would still hold her guilty for not having a clear conscience or strong mentality to resist that esp since she is married and living off the grace of her husband.\n\nThe cleaner lady had the conscience not to frame her mil and came clean during the mediation, so did her husband even though their lawyers tried to stop them. What I mean to say, the vl had the final option to come clean when they talked about the physical abuse but she didn't. She only came back when she lost her lover, honor and everything. I can't see an ounce of remorse in her. \n\nI agree she didn't have a happy ending but she also didn't deserve such kindness. For what she is finally going through was the same thing she made the farmer go through (lost his family, honor, suffered emotional trauma). He even had to tolerate the person who caused him such emotional pain only for the sake of child who is not even his own. I agree it was the best outcome for him but he is in a very tough and conflicting situation now. So I can't say the ending was excellent.",

Go back to Vietnam and her family who couldn't afford to feed her, and that has now added another mouth to feed?  I'm all for punishing people, but the child doesn't deserve that.  Neither does her family.\n\nFor her to drop off the kid at her husband's house and run off? Slightly better, but despite her moral failings, she seems to love her baby, and a child is always better off if the mother is around (assuming there is no abuse or neglect of course).\n\nSo I think that considering the scenario, this was the best outcome that rewarded all the blameless people, the farmer, his mother and the child and punished the ones to blame.  She might have a roof over her head, and food at the table after this, but in a society like Korea, her indiscretion is not about to be forgotten or forgiven and whispers will follow her until she is old.  Doubly so since she is a foreigner that doesn't seem all that keen to integrate.  Her life, going forward, will not be easy.\n\nIf I was to write fanfic about this, it would be a redemption arc where she learns to appreciate the kindness of the man that saved her from a life of poverty and falls in love with him.",

His only request was to have his \"honor\" restored which meant Atty Shin only had to prove that he never physically harmed her and to disprove her lies in court.  Considering he won the lawsuit, it would have been well within his rights to take his son and raise him alone with his mother (who was already doing that anyway). It does not appear that he ever asked for custody during the lawsuit.  If it is any consolation, I don't foresee his wife hanging around for any length of time.  Once his mother dies and all the work falls on her, she will crack.  I base that on how quickly she fell into an affair after her marriage, and her unwillingness to genuinely assimilate into her husband's culture which suggests a certain level of restlessness and discontent within her.  \n\nThe Farmer I am sure has already prepared himself mentally for her leaving them but will probably have to sleep with one eye open at all times.  Who knows what else she is capable of.  Definitely there were no winners in the final outcome.",

Sorry but I don't believe for one minute that she is that maternal. 4 months after giving birth, she was out partying and living it up and what does \"I have to go back to Vietnam to survive\" even mean.  The Lover only bolted when things started to get messy.  He was probably was not in Korea legally.  \n\nSince this is a such a hot topic I did a little research.  \"I only went there because my mother had begged me to\", quoted from the Farmer to Atty Shin.  That statement alone now makes so much more sense to me.  I honestly thought he went to Vietnam to take a break from the farming not to find a mail order bride.  LOL  Turns out per a 2020 study, more foreign brides in South Korea come from Vietnam than any other country and the South Korean government even gives a subsidy to men in rural areas for marrying a foreign woman provided they have not previously been married before. Unfortunately for him it really was love at first sight. Hence his anguish.\n\nBy law, the Farmer has to renew her visa every 3 years (as her marriage sponsor) but if she wants a separation, she can work and eventually become a permanent resident.  What is fascinating, is that she is also allowed to stay if she could prove that the she was a victim of abuse by the Farmer and/or if he was the cause of the breakdown of the marriage.  For that reason I guess is why Atty Shin sensed something was fishy all along. She met several of the criteria's for staying in South Korea separated and apart from her husband but was adamant about going back to Vietnam to a life of hardship.  Made no sense.  Let's be real, can you seriously see her suddenly doing an about face, taking on chores, helping out with the farming and happily raising her baby etc.? She didn't do it before when her husband was deliberately obtuse and as the saying goes, familiarity breeds contempt.  She certainly would not be the first mother to abandon her child for selfish reasons and she won't be the last.",

They would make not so serious matter into serious and vice versa lol. That camping scene, i kinda thought the other two maybe beforehand and yes they did, they really are immature lol. Hope the mother in law wins the case. Like shin imagine, against those 6 attorneys, that seems easy in the first meet. Lets see where this goes, hope the drama was longer its only 12 episodes",

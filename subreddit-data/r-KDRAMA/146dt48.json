One of the positives of this time of year is that the vividly-colored hydrangea are in bloom; the flower that is the symbol of the rainy season in this country. \n\nWhat I find interesting and slightly amusing about this is that, back in Australia, we tend to associate hydrangea with being that flower that we find in our elderly relatives\u2019 garden. This is not to say that we don\u2019t recognize them as beautiful flowers in Australia. But the idea of visiting a sightseeing spot for the purpose of viewing and photographing them, as people routinely do in Japan, would seem unusual.",

I can understand why they cast Teo Yoo instead since he's more age appropriate opposite Greta Lee (who is 40). The movie has been declared the best movie of 2023 and while it didn't quite live up to expectations for me, it's definitely worth a watch for fans of movies like \"Before Sunrise\". It's in the slice-of-life genre and the film is deliberately paced.",

The way it was shot, the tight claustrophobic feeling on the train, the masses of bodies appearing and falling... The psychological aspects - do you put yourself first or try to help others?  So very powerful. \n\nAlso, I finally got Viki so looking forward to being able to see some older dramas.",

Incredible charm, so hard to resist! \n\nUncontrollably Fond - Kim Woo-bin - oh my, what range in this drama, a range of emotions, attitudes, was hooked, and followed up with Our Blues and Black Knight to see more\n\nPachinko - Lee Min-ho - saw this awhile ago on Apple+, ah, such presence... \n\nwatching Reborn Rich, I was so amazed with Lee Sung-min - could hardly tell that he was also in Misaeng - so impressed on how he totally commits to a role, and I love his characters, flaws and all.\n\nGoblin was everything people said it was, and after seeing Gong Yoo, I had to check out Coffee Prince. \n\nThere are many more actors I really like, as well as actresses, (but that is another list!)",

The overall setup is ridiculous, the situations they find themselves in are laughable, and the stakes are always high. But throughout all of that the writing remains whip-smart and the characters, likeable. \n\nThe actors are also giving it their all and kudos to them! This is my first series with Kim Woo Bin and first he was despicable but now he\u2019s just charmed me. Kim Ji Won fully leans into her role as a wronged rich b*tch. Even Krystal and baby Park Hyung Sik are a delight as the airheads of the group. \n\nI have to say that acting wise, the leads are the weakest links. Park Shin Hye seems to have a permanent deer-in-the headlights reaction to everything and Lee Min Ho here is the same guy I watched in The King Eternal Monarch. But that\u2019s OK, somehow their less than stellar acting also fits.  It can be explained as how teenagers are.\n\nI guess that\u2019s it - all of The Heirs feels extremely nostalgic. When you\u2019re in high school everything feels high-stakes and first love was you and me against the world. This series perfectly captures the rollercoaster of emotions of that time of life which looking back many years after the fact, was totes ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019ve grown enough that I can laugh at myself now.",

The first one has too much back story to set up, i think. Id at least give it one more episode! .

To start, this is exactly what Jason Kim excels at and delivers every time: 1.) genuine bromance/friendship; 2.) great fight scenes; and 3.) an underdog story. He always follows a simple and predictive story structure that is so incredibly effective for the story it\u2019s telling.\n\nI won\u2019t say much about our leads because I will go on for too long, but praises and praises all around. This isn't just two fit, and I mean FIT, guys fighting the bad guys. WDH absolutely killed this role. This was role was made for him, and I believe that it's because Jason Kim obviously loves WDH. The amazing fighter who is so soft and vulnerable with a strong moral compass. Is there even anything bad to say about WDH or this character? I admit that LSY had to sell me on the character in the beginning. I don't think his character really came to fruition or was as developed at the same level as WDH and I wish that it did, but it worked, nonetheless. I have never seen LSY in a role like this and I think he pulled it off!\n\nOne thing I really want to highlight about this drama is that it did so well in making us care enough about each good guy. I find that it\u2019s been so tough for these Netflix kdramas with a robust cast and limited episodes to get the audience to care for the characters. Bloodhounds is one that actually pulled it off so well, especially being a kdrama that had lots of character introductions throughout the whole thing, which I usually don't like because it's always done poorly. The performances, chemistry, and story pieced together so well that it really makes you feel that everyone on the good guy team really cares about helping take down the villain.",

There weren't nearly as many big crying sessions as in Good Bad Mother, but somehow, to me, it felt much more emotionally wrenching.",

            "comment": "Finished **Bloodhounds** at 0347 this morning and instantly bumped it up to my Top 5. Everything in it just *works*. I have minor nits to pick but overall, it's just so incredibly well done. I was surprised when I looked up writer/director Kim Joo-Hwan's resume on AsianWiki because I felt sure he'd done more, but he's got five movies and BH is his first drama series! So I look forward to following him around like a Koreaboo (jk).\n\nThe setup of BH is simple: boxer and \"professional part-timer\" Kim Gun-Woo (Woo Do-Hwan, amazing as always) helps his single mother (played by Yun Yoo-Sun) as she struggles under a burden of debt (the beginning gave me serious *Rocky II* vibes, in a good way). He meets fellow Marine (Salute!) Hong Woo-Jin (Lee Sang-Yi) during a boxing match, and the bromance never stops! Their pairing is balanced in the best ways, with Woo-jin being brash and enthusiastic, while Gun-woo is quiet, unassuming, and just the *best boy*. Building on a strong foundation of their pairing, their fight against a ruthless loan shark, Kim Myeong-Gil (Park Sung-Woong) begins.\n\nHere are some random thoughts:\n\n* Tae Won-Seock's Kang In-Beom has the most epic drip of any henchman since Odd Job. As soon as In-Beom shows up, in silhouette, looking like a mountain wearing a bucket hat, he commands the scenes he's in.\n* Thrillers are only as good as their villains, and I did not expect Park Sung-Woong, who I last saw being an adorkable nerd dad in **Unlock My Boss**, to be so good at being so bad.\n* Speaking of henchmen, Bae Je-Ki as **Yang Jae-Myeong**, a low-level thug just trying to get by, is a comic gem. \n* I didn't miss the romance.\n* The allies' setup of reclusive bazillionaire President Choi Tae-Ho (Heo Jun-Ho), his right-hand men Hwang Yang-Jung (Lee Hae-Young) and Lee Du-Yeong (Ryu Soo-Young), his BFF Oh In-Muk (Min Kyung-Jin) and his granddaughter-in-spirit Kim Hyeon-Ju (Kim Sae-Ron) reminded me a lot of **Taxi Driver** but in all good ways.\n* Hyeon-Ju is a wonderful character, just 10/10 no notes. \n* The action scenes are *so good* I can't even italicize that enough. Just kinetic and skilled and brutal and beautiful all at the same time. The hand-held action never veered into shaky-cam territory, and always kept you centered in the shots so you knew everything that was happening. The fights are inventive and exciting with clearly defined stakes!\n* The cameos! &gt;!I was NOT PREPARED for Minjae to deploy his dimples for evil!!&lt;\n* All the little touches make it such a funny, grounded struggle for justice it hit right in every wheelhouse I have (except romance).\n\ntl;dr **Bloodhounds** was great, and at 8 episodes (on Netflix), it's a quick binge even with some of the episodes pushing well past an hour in length.\n\nTrigger Warnings for KNIFES! &gt;!I hate slicing. The first !&lt;*Pet Semetary* &gt;!movie where the little dead kid slices the Achilles tendon of the judge from !&lt;*My Cousin Vinny* &gt;!is stuck in my brain, as are multiple scenes from the HBO series !&lt;*Oz* &gt;!and the kdrama !&lt;**Somebody** &gt;!where there's Achilles tendons being sliced all over the place. With that said: trigger warning for deliberate slicing of Achilles tendons in BH. Just in case you hate slicing, as well.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Started watching **My Perfect Stranger**. I'm about halfway through to being caught up. I liked how they used time travel as a trigger, similar to *365*, with a car as the time machine, though, unfortunately, not as cool as the DeLorean from BTTF. Because I can, I'm gonna say this show is BTTF set in 1987 and re-imagined as a crime thriller, with Doc (ML) and Marty (FL) traveling to the past to catch a killer and save lives, what should be familiar territory for the ML at least. Sadly, no BTTF references... yet!\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue I've found with the show so far is how it made little sense for the two leads not to open up about their motives sooner, as they gained nothing by it. I'm also slightly worried about the writer resurrecting the time machine for some BTTF 2 shenanigans, with someone from 1987 stealing the time machine for nefarious reasons. Hmm, it's more likely that the ML will die in the past and the FL needs to save his future self, who'll remember nothing. Yup, that sounds very kdrama-ish. Will they loop it, I wonder, with the ML/FL leaving the car and the instruction manual for the ML's past self?\n\nIn any case, so far so good. Let's hope Episodes 7-12 keep it up.",

Although it wasn't stated in words, the MLs were clearly careful about showing affection when out in public because of the risks, and didn't live in a fantasy-land where all prejudice had magically disappeared (if only that were the case!) They were also choosy about whom they disclosed to among their friends. Older ML's inconsistent behavior made sense because of his inner struggles, which were shown to the audience. He wasn't perfect, he had both strengths and issues, and younger ML understood this. Some of the editing was a little weird, maybe because the drama was shot on a budget, but the effect was also successfully artistic at times. Loved the beach and surfing scenes.\n\nedit: changed a word",

So I decided to go back to it 'cause I remembered it was quite good, depicting the relationship between a blind teacher and composer and a young psychology student who's a fan of his music. Maybe I had something of a premonition about this show, as it started falling apart in the second half. I'm five episodes away from finishing it and, well, I'm not quite sure I want to, what's a shame because the actress playing the FL is great.\n\nTo be fair, the main leads' relationship was perhaps too sweet to last undisturbed throughout, even if there were moments of tension (FL's mom is an obvious red flag in every cdrama it would seem), but I wonder how long your relationship would last if the writer of your life suddenly decided to rain down the 10 plagues of Egypt on you, all at the same time. Over the span of a few episodes, every bad thing under the sun seems to happen to the leads, and even to the supporting cast (this felt rushed as f\\*\\*\\*). Consequently, they're both on edge, saying hurtful things they're too stubborn to explain, take back, or apologise for. Thus, three years go by as they go their separate lives. The ML has now become the CEO of his dad's company because the script said so, and apparently this event has demanded he become the typical overbearing and controlling rich-\"boyfriend\"-CEO who stalks his poor-**EX**\\-girlfriend, gets mad when she drinks with other men, and actually has the gall of telling her she will date no other men but him. And this is supposed to be funny/romantic going by the BGM selection. It was most definitely not.\n\nRather than have the two leads sit down and talk about their issues like the adults they pretend to be, the show thinks it's better to skip this boring talk altogether and have them get back together ASAP using all the standard tropes of the genre. Will it work? I'll tell you if I'm able to finish it, but for now, I'm on Han Solo's side, \"[That's not how The Force works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhDBSne5HMI)\"",

The show is so slow, but in a way that I don't hate. The emotional beats and character growth feel very earned because of it.\n\nI *love* the way Woojoo is lying so much to herself, and Jun really can tell. Immediately. Like her talking about how she'll quit the job soon, and he's like 'just do it now'. When in reality, she doesn't want to abandon him and the company. She's not ready to let go.\n\nI also find the Jun x Haesung stuff actually super cute. I think it's obvious they are a love line. They had the whole giraffe/lion conversation, and then it cut to two figurines next to each other (a giraffe and a lion) that cutely topple over after she kicks him out lol",

Imperfect but perfect at the same time. He really is a sweet person. But so so damaged. That flashback of him in middle school at the track meet was telling. The actor is killing it! Will have to watch his other dramas now because I am sort obsessed now\u2026\n\nI definitely think the older sister and FL\u2019s best friend &gt;!will end up together. I love the opposites attract trope and they have a good back and forth going.!&lt; I don\u2019t think the best friend is in love with FL. I am dying that she is interested in her little brother\u2019s &gt;!friend without knowing!&lt; she is going to lose it when she finds out \ud83d\ude4a\n\nAgain, chemistry is\u2026sizzling. \n\nIt really is messed up how she\u2019s falling in love with the son of her dad\u2019s mistress but hey there is drama in the word kdrama\ud83e\udd23\n\nI hate FL\u2019s paternal side of the family - what garbage relatives, especially the salon owning aunt.\n\nTbh, I want ML to find out about FL\u2019s true identity asap &gt;!although part of me thinks he suspects she is the daughter of the man her mother married and took the house from. He\u2019s smart but like he told her, pretends not to know things. I still have a sneaking suspicion but maybe I\u2019m wrong.!&lt;",

Along with him knowing about CEO Shin's wife... he's portrayed as a smart character who has cards up his sleeve and keeps quiet. I hope his new plan works and his company is revived!! A happy ending would be appreciated.",

Autumn in My Heart and Stairway to Heaven, some of my fav rom melos, are very dramatic so I guess this is a nice change of pace!! \ud83d\ude02",

Can't wait.!&lt;\n\nIf the drama is setting up &gt;!MY with Sunwoo!&lt;, I won't mind TBH. It might distract her from her fixation on DJ...\n\n&gt;!SUHO IS JIGOO'S FRIEND!!!!&lt; NO WAY! When JG asked him if the woman he's texting is hot and he was like, 'IDK, she's old,' I lost my shit. Oh, that's gonna be such a glorious mess.\n\nOMG, &gt;!JIGOO-WOOJOO CONFRONTATION WITH DONGJIN AS THE AUDIENCE!!!!&lt; This is everything I've ever wanted lmaoooooo. WJ's squint when JG said he quit preparing for the civil service exam was so understated yet so deadly. Lee Sungkyung is really good at playing these comically fierce characters and I'm glad *Call It Love* is giving her material to work with.\n\nHoly shit, Hyeseong has game! &gt;!I thought her pursuit of Suho was going to be a dead end, but her little speech by the coffee machine totally got to him!!&lt;\n\nThe scene where WJ told DJ &gt;!to just sue MY for making him get drunk and fall down!&lt; and he didn't know whether to be appalled, impressed or entertained by her feral personality was so good! It highlighted their difference in personality (he's way too genteel to even think half the shit she says out loud), but it also showed us the basis of his attraction to her so clearly. In general I love how DJ can't help but find WJ amusing even when he's super depressed. 'Hot guy who thinks a weird girl is funny' is such a rare and underrated romantic dynamic. (Watcher also gave us a very small dose of the good stuff, but sadly it's an OCN drama, so there's no real romance to speak of, just half-assed subtext.)\n\nNoooooo, don't make me feel bad for &gt;!CEO Shin!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Woojoo is telling herself not to fall for DJ!!&lt; IT'S HAPPENING.GIF\n\nOK, I suppose &gt;!Dongjin has two friends: Sunwoo and the suspiciously wealthy car mechanic guy.!&lt; I'm starting to suspect &gt;!MY cheated on him with the car mechanic.!&lt; I hope I'm wrong because he seems nice, but the vibes are slightly off.\n\nLMAO, MY deserves to be tortured by &gt;!DJ's mother!&lt;. I just hope DJ's pride won't obligate him to pay off his mother's debt to her; boy, let them do whatever they want! &gt;!If MY thinks she can get you back by pandering to your mother!&lt;, that's her problem, not yours!\n\nOK, am I reading too deeply into things or did &gt;!DJ go back to the noodle restaurant WJ took him to!&lt;? Like, &gt;!the restaurant where they had their heart to heart at the beginning of episode 6 is the same place where he later went to drink alone and where WJ found him, right? And that's also where WJ, Joon and HS had dinner in an earlier episode. I like this little detail of WJ showing DJ one of her favourite places.!&lt;\n\nOMG, &gt;!DONGJIN HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR \"THE DAUGTHER\"? WHAT???? IS HE GOING TO FIND OUT NEXT WEEK OR NOT?!&lt; I feel like it could go either way, but I'm leaning toward not yet. I think &gt;!something will happen to make them miss each other at the realtor's office.!&lt;\n\nBoth episodes this week were excellent, give me more NOW!",

(And also tVN simply shows fewer crime dramas because its dramas cover a greater variety of genres, while OCN had 2 ongoing crime dramas at any given time like clockwork.) But I think I read somewhere there\u2019s an upcoming OCN drama currently in production, so maybe they\u2019ll come back\u2026",

I actually don't see them being the endgame because she's being fake - pretending to like the same food he likes - but having him chase her around will be the catalyst that Joon needs to realize that he loves her. Or something.\n\nI loved Ji-gu's reaction upon meeting Dong-jin in the street. The thought bubble above his head said: \"My savior!\"\n\nI really hate Min-yeong and would not like for her to end up with Seon-woo. Seon-woo is a bit flighty, but he actually seems like a really good guy who cares about Dong-jin a lot. Seon-woo deserves better.\n\nMin-yeong may have her reasons for doing that to Dong-jin. But nothing can really justify that. So... she can try to win him back and just continue to be pathetic. I don't care.\n\nAnother terrible person - Dong-jin's mom. How ridiculously terrible is she? But her actions brought our OTP together. So yay, I guess? Her and Min-yeong can just go be pathetic together while Dong-jin leaves them behind.",

She's trying to act \"younger\" and \"cuter\" instead of being her authentic self. It seems Joon has always been that friend whose been dependable and always honest with her. He's also seen her in all her realness and that's what I think will ultimately draw them closer together. \n\nAs for Joon's relationship with Woo-joo... Personally, I don't think Joon likes Woo-joo in a romantic sense. I think there's more of a familial and protective vibe that I get from him. He's concerned for her, obviously, as her best friend and he doesn't want her to get into any sticky situation she'll regret. Anyways, if the writer somehow forces a cliche and awkward love triangle between Joon-Woojoo-Dong-jin in the upcoming episodes, I will riot!",

They're either using the pink filter less or I don't even notice it anymore. ML's mother is the worst and the ex is only mildly annoying. I love the siblings, they're nothing like Woojoo. I wonder if Woojoo was closest to the father so that plus seeing the affair hit harder for her than her siblings. Also,  I assume the siblings wouldn't even recognize the ML's mother if they saw her. \n\n\nLastly, the leads have amazing chemistry, and I don't think I can handle a kiss scene.

I think it'd be good timing (and for my own sanity lol). \n\nJust as Woojoo (and him) are catching feelings and becoming aware of them, to be faced with this truth and for WJ, why she got entangled with DJ to begin with. A reminder and another reason for her hardened revenge. And for DJ, to finally understand her strange actions-- and hopefully later, how she truly didn't follow through on any of it. Of course, this is all probably going to come much later, but I truly can't wait. \n\nAnd of course, eventually, for WJ to learn that the direction of her hatred is misguided. And for her to also learn the truth of the money, of HDJ and his mom's relationship. I guess the writers will probably make that reveal happen in tandem with the reveal of whatever reason the ex broke up with HDJ for. (Probably his mom continuously barraging her with money requests and other things of the short?).\n\nWoojoo and Dongjin are so well matched though, and I definitely found myself wanting to see them interact more, talk more, move closer.",

            "comment": "Since i have been reading alot of recaps and insights I thought it would be fun to talk about theories. I am looking at these potential theories. I am curious if there could possibly be a twist regarding Heeja being DonJin's biological mother. There is such a Cinderella vibe with Donjin's character. What if Donjin's father married Heeja AFTER Donjin was born? What if she raised him from a young child and he never knew any other mother? Why would she raise Donjin if his father died?  Because she could have been made his guardian and got the money from raising him. Maybe the Uncle is his biological Uncle or a good friend of his fathers that knew he lost it all when his father died? I just don't see a motherly vibe at all with Heeja! She reminds me of the evil stepmother in Cinderella. Also I think Heeja KNOWS something about MinYoung! I think she could be behind their break up somehow and black mailing her. Would it not be amazing if Heeja turned out not to be Donjin's blood! Or she may have trapped Donjin's father into an unwanted pregnancy and married her or lied who the father was?But she abandoned Donjin and his dad until the father died. I feel the Uncle wanting Donjin to have that apartment is telling. He may have tried to get custody and could not so he gave him the one thing Donjin always wanted a home. He and WooJoo would both have been victims. Also I am concerned she could be a Black Widow she has had ALOT of husbands!! I already see the cutest POSSIBLE FUTURE scenes they could do at the end. My guess is The Uncle taught him camping and his happiest times were when he could spend with his Uncle at the campsite. Maybe because of the courts or just because Heeja would run off and leave him with the Uncle from time to time.\n\nNot sure how the Uncle is related to him\n\nFather\n\nHeeja\n\nor potential birth mother\n\nfamily friend\n\nMY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPredictions\n\nDonjin has bought the old house and married WooJoo and started a family. I could see him playing in an indoor tent with his son or daughter or both inside the old house. He will have a little cat for his kids. He will have his own car lol. They could also show them camping as a family. I think he REALLY wants to be a dad and have kids. He seemed all googly eyed over his friends kids picture and seeing that spys kid walking with his dad. I think he loves that WooJoo has a mothers instinct for her siblings and will see her as mother to his children and a woman who would NEVER EVER cheat on him or leave when the going got tough!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also can see them replaying the happy scenes he had with MY with WJ from an outside view to show their happiness.\n\nOne other thing i saw as potential forshadowing....\n\nAt the grocery store when the supermarket guy calls her a housewife and she corrects him .... I think that will come true as a real housewife shopping with Donjin in her neighborhood supermarket maybe pregnant awww.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Does anyone know how I can change my profile name? I never chose that name lol I am REDD4169",

Unlike MLN, I completely understand why our leads are the way they are. In MLN the FL approached life like she was walking underwater with the tide against her. Her demeanor seemed defeated. Okay, but when/how did that occur? The show failed in that aspect so I could never empathize with her plight. I didn't see the point",

To me, it was one of those things that I didn't need resolved because her existentialist dread seemed like something so many people experience, for no particular reason. There wouldn't have been a trigger point, just one day coming to the realization that you aren't really living and just merely dragging your body along from one place to the next. Never quite present, never quite whole. \n\nBut Shim Woo Joo is obviously very different from Mi Jeong and I really love both of them. I love the recent barrage of FLs jaded with life.",

Even if there wasn\u2019t a clear single trigger point, her circumstances made the way she was perfectly understandable. She didn\u2019t come from societal privilege so was taken advantage of at work, did not have much money to indulge in hobbies and fun that her peers had, faced a lengthy commute both ways everyday that cut into her personal time, was born at a time when her family didn\u2019t have much resources to care for her (financially and emotionally), and with her louder siblings it\u2019s easy to overlook her needs and issues. She\u2019s also had bad luck in love\n\nBut I agree generally that the characters in Call It Love are easier to understand from their body language, somehow",

I felt so much anger at their little brother when both sisters already sacrifice their youth and time so that the brother has an education and now he don't want to study anymore but instead playing game and sing. I hope that singing gig will pay off cause if not, he not only heartbreak himself, but also his two sisters",

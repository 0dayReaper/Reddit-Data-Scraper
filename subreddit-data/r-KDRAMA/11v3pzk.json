It\u2019s refreshing to see Jeon Do-yeon play such a different character compared to her character in **Lost** (the only other drama I\u2019ve seen her in), and Jung Kyung-ho is charismatic as usual (I\u2019ve seen him in **Hospital Playlist** and **Prison Playbook**. Hoping to watch **Life on Mars** at some point\u2026)\n\nSad that I wasn\u2019t able to participate in the on-air discussions but happy that I can watch knowing that all the episodes are out! (I\u2019m sure many of us have experience \u201cThe Kdrama Dilemma\u201d at some point haha)",

It went to some unexpected places. And costars some familiar K-drama actors (Kim Sun Young, the mom from Because This Is Your First Life, as well as Oh Kwang Rok). The lead actress, Park Ji-Min, was very good, especially since she\u2019s not an actress by trade. She\u2019s a visual artist.",

Adult characters who can't make up their minds about should they date or not, behaving like schoolchildren, constantly creating unnecessary drama instead of just talking to each other like normal grown up people.\n\n2. Male lead being reaaaally stalkerish. He was rejected time and time again and yet he still persists!\n\nThis kind of stuff usually infuriates me immediately but for some reason this time I'm still here watching and rooting for them xD\n\nAlso the second lead syndrome is strong with this one, Jong Hyun is so adorable I started hoping Soo Young will end up with him and they have their happily ever after.\n\nI'm at episode 7 right now, very curious how it all goes.",

The story skillfully combines a taut spy thriller witha warm, domestic slice of life starring So Ji Sub as the NIS agent Kim Bon on the run. He lives across the hall from a mother with two mischevious twins and the story gallops through how Kim Bon redeems his name while seeking to reveal the NIS mole at the same time as babysitting the twins.\n\nThis show has it all: ferocious fight scenes, tense spycraft, neighbourhood ajummas, romance, luxury handbags and excellent storytelling. As the hero So Ji Sub has one of those mesmerizing faces that can convey the weight of his sorrow or his sheer delight when he hangs out with the twins.  And Jung In Sun (from Welcome to Waikiki) plays the twins' mother who starts to depend on Kim Bom in other ways than just childcare.\n\n**Diary of a Prosecutor** \\- LOVED this show but got so peckish watching it because every second scene has the lovable gang of prosecutors eating delicious meals or downing soju and snacks at their hangout Wet Fog. Warm, well written and casted, this drama got me through a terrible flu when all I could do was lie down and open up a bag of Chicago Mix popcorn and dive into the daily life and tribulations of legal professionals in a small coastal city. :)",

Thanks for the rec!\n\nAnd **Diary of a Prosecutor** is one of my top legal dramas. It has a lot in common with the more lauded **Hospital Playlist** - professional slice of life with warmth and humor that touches on deeper societal issues without being bleak or heavy-handed - and it's equally as excellent. It's criminally underrated; hopefully now that it's on Netflix more people get a chance to watch and enjoy it!",

I gave myself a headache from crying so hard, and my dog was so worried. I have seen so many people play \u201cfalling in love,\u201d but the reality that they actually did made it have this air of realness that I\u2019ve not seen before. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I already know they\u2019re together, but the way they looked at each other was so real and didn\u2019t seem like acting. I also really enjoyed the large amount of accuracy in North Korean life, although I know it wasn\u2019t perfect. I honestly feel like I learned stuff I didn\u2019t know and often found myself googling to gain more information (class systems in DRPK, black markets, currencies used, etc.). **CLOY** is definitely in my top ten now and I\u2019m mad at myself for putting it off for so long. \n\nI started **Divorce Attorney Shin** and omg is Cho Seung Woo so hot in it. It\u2019s the hair, the clothes, the personality, and the glasses. I thought he looked familiar but I couldn\u2019t figure out why until I saw who he was in **Life**, then I felt like an idiot. I\u2019m definitely enjoying it so far and since it\u2019s currently airing, it will be easy to keep up with during school.",

For now, about what I know, I'm maybe the first guy in western world to write a kdrama and study korean screenplay format, and some drama screenplay I download on korean website, then translate it badly thanks to google trad.\n\nAlas, It was best to write a new kdrama (what I will do next, maybe, one day). But I started writing the sequel of another kdrama. **W two worlds**. I did it because I've too many ideas, several files of thousand lines during the preparation phase (yeh, all is planned, it's not a writing \"as you go\").\n\nIn a way, even if I write accurate screenplay, it's still a fan fiction. For any people who would like to read that, it's free. I win no money, it's really amateurish in the core, just I try to do it like a pro k-screenwriter would do it. As there is probably no chance this is produced one day, I added some concept in this \"visual screenplay\". So anyone can read this more easely than a screenplay or even a novel. I'm currently in the correcting phase of episodes.\n\nIt's here: [http://w4worlds.eklablog.com/](http://w4worlds.eklablog.com/)",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the Goblin episode, very interesting. Have you noticed many differences between Western style writing and Korean? \n\nI was also planning to write a screenplay, and we started on it, but my friend pulled out because she felt her work was not good enough, and I didn't want to do it alone. I read a lot of \"how to write a screenplay\", but obviously not in Korean. \n\nOne difference I have long wondered about just from watching, is if the Korean screenplays notes more the feelings of the characters, and from the little I read now from your Goblin screenplay, it seems they do. The guy who wrote Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon, writes a lot about how this is the actors job to figure out. I think that this idea makes it harder to create personal development in the characters, and also that in general, the actors don't have the the same overview of the script or the understanding of the underlaying meta-subject that is the writer's purpose with the script. \n\nAnother difference is in the practical actual filming. I read an interview with Little Steven about filming Lilyhammer. He said he was really shocked at how many suggestions the actor came up with, and how they changed the script on the set because of that. Norwegian style on set was totally different from in US. Also the writer of Shame, Julie Andem, tells of her difficulties in getting used to the hierarchy in the US. One incident was when she asked the camera man \"what do you think?\" and he was like shocked that she would ask him his opinion. \n\nI don't know where you live, in France? Now EU has decided that thirty percent of content or something on international streaming services has to be homemade, and the EU countries can decide themselves if that means \"from this country\" or \"from EU\". So there will be more opportunities. That is how Korea built their industry. But I think the reason why Korea's dramas are popular with women, is that they are not only meant for a female audience, they are also written by women, to such an extent that women have had the possibility to learn from each other, and in such a way have built their own style. \n\nFemale humour for example is often more situational and less the comic (mean) one-liner. More emphasis of personality and less on plot. Things like that. \n\nAlso in many Korean dramas the men talk around ten times more than the women.",

Yes, you mention the difference that I have seen.\n\nI absolutely think that Korean script become better because of the more detailed descriptions. Then the director is free to ignore the descriptions of course, which I am sure they often do. Cut scenes and change scenes and I am even sure that the male assistant of female lead in **A Korean Oddyssey** was written as a female. \n\nOr the difference between part one and two of **Alchemy of Souls**.

                            "comment": "Hi, you saw the differences. There are others, I have listed them elsewhere. The format is not unique, unlike the Western format. Sometimes a writer uses a different convention. For example the scene header is S#1 or S/1, or something else. In Goblin, when doing an INTERCUT, the writer starts the line in the other place with \"/\". Which is a very good idea. In the W screenplay, the writer numbers the sub-scenes of a montage. Very good idea too. All of this is the technical aspect.\r  \n\r  \nI find that someone who doesn't write screenplays but novels can easily make the transition to this format. Provided they use the screenplay style of course. Present tense. Concise. Visual. Cinematic order. Character name starting dialogue line. Tell what you see on the screen without camera guidance. etc.\r  \n\r  \nAs far as content is concerned, you are right. It allows for a better emphasis. However, reading the first scene, the Goblin screenplay has too many words and repetitions. But I guess a translation error. In truth, it's very concise most of the time. The descriptions are as short as a western screenplay. Except for some moments where it takes longer, important scene, emotion, atmosphere, etc. I would need to give precise examples at this point, as it comes from my screenplay studies.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not sure, but I guess everything is done faster (pale pale). With experience, the writers write everything more perfectly faster. This requires less corrections. A western movie screenplay can have dozens of revisions in comparison. And a drama is long, complicated to revise.\r  \n\r  \nTo help you write in this style: all screenwriting tips and advice are good. \r  \n\r  \nIt's just that afterwards, it's put in Korean format, and use the freedom of brackets, and don't forget to reinforce the key scenes. Some passages look like prose but not quite, the purpose is to guide the actors, the director, the film crew. That everyone has a deep understanding of what is happening at this important moment.\r  \n\r  \nUnlike in the West, the spirit of the writers is very respected. I know the drama W very well (rewatched many times) and the screenplay is very respected. The emotions and subtext in the dialogues are precise and deep, and the actors transpose this without changing. They add their talent as well. Some dialogues are very precise, while others are less so, offering areas of freedom. For example, sometimes a character even has just (expression) in the description of his or her line of dialogue. Which says nothing, except that there is a shot of their face, and the actor chooses what they want.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know why men talk more in kdrama, lol. I hadn't noticed. It could be cultural. Or because the audition target is women and they want a romantic story with that man? I can just testify simply: as a man, I tend to detail female characters better too. Weird. The characters who have the most backstory in my story are women. Maybe because the male characters already existed? I don't know.\r  \n\r  \nI can't answer about Alchemy of Soul, I haven't finished the drama yet, due to lack of time.\r  \n\r  \nAbout Joss Whedon. I haven't seen much of Buffy. It was a hit. I read his screenplay for \"The Avengers\". It's perfect effective writing. Really short, I could barely find sentences I could have shortened. Evocative, punchy verbs. I write a bit in this style at the core, minimalist. But I play with the tempo of the sentences, use various tricks from other screenwriters like Walter Hill. And of course, the things that are impossible in Western screenplay about brackets and longer depth on key scenes. I think it's important to write very short and concise. It frees up space and allows you to be longer when necessary. \r  \n\r  \nAs a conclusion, my general feeling: written in Korean format, I have the feeling to have a very alive story. Feeling of freedom. I write faster than with the screenplay software (WriterSolo). I tried in western format (I have a drama episode in this format). But I get stuck sometimes. I have to carry over brackets in action line, I make some format mistakes.",

I wondered the reason why the Western screenplays write in that style with the name on the line above. Maybe it is so that the actor don't get confused by the name and go directly to the lines? Because they usually colour their own lines in their own screen book. \n\nNot so sure about the number of revisions. That has to do with money and time. Whether it is \"get it out quickly\" or if it is \"it is too expensive to film something of bad quality, it has to be top.\" Pretty sure Alchemy of Souls part two would have been different if they had more time. We often see the lower quality in the later episodes when it is filmed on the fly. \n\n&gt; as a man, I tend to detail female characters better too. Weird. The characters who have the most backstory in my story are women. \n\nIf you do this, you are very special, as you will know from that sub, *men writing women*. Anyway, both men and women tend to listen to the men and notice the men a little bit more than they listen to women. That is just a fact of life. We also don't don't know that much of what goes on behind the scenes: Did the director/producer cut out some scenes, and only those scenes where women speak? Did the company committee that decided on the which screenplay to film prefer screenplays and writers that focus more on men? Or is it the idea that heterosexual women like to look at men, so lets have a lot of pretty young men here? (Which definitely is true, look at a list of random dramas, and you find the main cast consist of four men to every woman.)\n\nActually some of the Norwegian novel writers write very short sentences, so it is familiar to me. I think that now that we have lots of AI, it is possible to also check your scenario in a bot like that and see if the scene comes out as you planned it. \n\nYour comment is very inspiring, but I have some other projects lined up that it looks like I will never finish. Also I don't really want to do something demanding like that unless my brain is on top, which it almost never is. \n\nWish you luck with your writing! And even if it doesn't end up in a film, that you will have many fun moments by yourself.

So a page is \\~one minute. A movie of 2h is so 120 pages. It's not very attractive to read, but I still prefer that than a novel now. I like to have the character name! I dislike it when there is a line: \"blah blah blah\" said XXX. No, I don't want to wait to know who speak or have some confusion about that. Just-a-plain-name first.\n\nI was thinking just \"women write more men\" and \"men write more women\". The kdrama propose a love story. And so, any woman can quickly identify with the heroine. No need to say too much, so anyone can identify to her.\n\nBut as we love someone, we get all the detail of this person, it resonates and amplify. It's maybe why I put more on women too in the script. Here, I give a portray of a woman more complete, thinking, \"gosh, she's bad, but I would fall in love anyway\".\n\nAlso, it depends greatly of dramas. If the heroine is a woman, then she still have the most attention. Check one of my favorite drama \"Jang ok Jung\".\n\nBut be sure producers or directors doesn't cut anything. The script are used as they are written (of course, it can happen some small changes, but not related to that). So it's true most of kdrama screenwriters are women, and enjoy to portray men, as I enjoy to portray women too.\n\nYour brain not on top? mmmh. Sounds like a excuse. Mine isn't on top too. If you don't finish, it's probably a lack of preparation. I see that often, people start then give up or loose motivation. It's because first, it needs the most of the story in structure files. Many of the greatest ideas and striking scenes on draft. And many other details, characters, background, chronological path (plotline). I think once it's done, the writing have a clear compass and is more enjoyable. Also, it boosts motivation to the max, and you can be sure you finish the story.",

Even if I can tell that: put sometimes a drama clich\u00e9 makes more good than bad. It's very strange, as most of the time we prefer avoid clich\u00e9s in a script.\n\nSome screenplay are published, paper version. For example Memories of the Alhambra. I couldn't buy it because as a paper version (or kindle one) I can't do nothing about that. I need to translate it (google trad), even aproximative way, quite bad, but it doesn't matter, it's just to give an idea what the writer do. So I translated some dramas or episodes. Here I give you the link of a famous one. Very experimented writer. Goblin Ep1. :\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2WgDhzLNeUguiIcEqsUKs\\_Taf0E8vgo/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2WgDhzLNeUguiIcEqsUKs_Taf0E8vgo/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI used some regular expression to make it more easy to read. Here it's a content you can't find anywhere in the world. Or you'll just get the korean one on a website. \n\n\"My Liberation Notes\" should be a nice one to read, sure. I didn't finished it yet (had no time last weeks because busy). But on first episodes, we have something good. Slow, but interesting.",

Hoping Netflix has something stored for us and does a special episode or something with the  &gt;!psycho!&lt; dude. Really relly liked, all the actors did such a great job!! Very satisfying revenge i must say.",

Or maybe go overboard and use a too high honorific all the time just to be on the safe side, but that can be construed as rude as well. A way to put distance between you and a friend.\n\nEDIT: Added **here**",

Personally don't know anyone with autism who speaks Korean, but I don't really know that many people who speak Korean in the first place.\n\nTheoretically, one way I could see them be able to speak Korean is if the particular individual doesn't struggle (or only struggles a little) with communication and autism manifests in different areas of their life. (i'm trying to reference the autism wheel - [link](https://ablelight.org/blog/why-the-autism-wheel-is-replacing-the-spectrum/) to article and how it look; i'm not sure how well-known it is)\n\nAlso, this is me mashing up two facts, but I remember reading somewhere that in Japan eye contact with superiors is considered a sign of defiance and is something to be discouraged so if the same thing is true in Korea it would be a benefit for autists who struggle with eye contact.",

Although autism is a symptom diagnosis, and including the symptoms actually vary a lot between people, there is a great human variety everywhere, and for sure people with autism will exist everywhere. \n\nThank you for calling my question interesting. You are right at pointing out the variation among people with autism, which would make it difficult to make some kind of comparison. \n\nHonestly I thought about it because I thought that for me it would be very difficult often to guess which person they are talking about, but then I thought that maybe, if I were brought up in Korea, I would be better at guessing it. Possibly even to be brought up with their style of talking would be like a training in understanding context better?\n\nThanks for the wheel, I haven't seen it before.

OMG it\u2019s hysterical. After watching Misaeng and CCIR recently, it\u2019s fun to see Kim Dae Myung (Assistant Manager Kim!) and Kim Mi Kyung (NHS\u2019s mom) in this. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Jung So Min here as well. \n\nI\u2019m about halfway through **When the Camellia Blooms** and I\u2019m still guessing on the murder mystery and enjoying Kang Ha Neul as the ML. The slow burn romance is cute. \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to watch The Glory, but I\u2019m a little wary because I don\u2019t like to watch bullying. But I\u2019m intrigued due to all the hype.",

Note that as a Netflix Original web drama, it's not subject to the broadcast regulations so there's no blurring/holding back in the amount and type of violence they portray.\n\nDon't let the hype make you feel like you *must watch* something you are uncomfortable with watching in the first place. Despite the hype, not everyone has watched it and it's okay to not watch it.",

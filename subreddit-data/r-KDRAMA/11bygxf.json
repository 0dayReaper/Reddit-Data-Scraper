I was really excited about all of the good Kdramas I was able to watch, but I think that might\u2019ve burned me out a little. I was in a slight slump after **Through the Darkness**, but **Weak Hero Class 1** brought me back. Since then, I\u2019ve watched **At a Distance, Spring is Green**, **Love to Hate You**, and currently watching **The Fiery Priest** (20/40). Now I\u2019m watching at my normal pace (1 at a time, no on-airs), mostly because I have less time. Maybe in a few months this will change but I think this is my \u201cwatching style\u201d for now.\n\nAnyone else have fluctuating watching styles? \ud83d\ude05",

A big thing in this industry--especially at my point--is knowing which shows you want to write for, where your writing style fits, watching a lot of recent American shows to 'stay in the know', and making your samples fit either the comedy, drama, or dramedy 'Western' voice/storytelling philosophy.\n\nI feel like k-dramas have messed this up for me \ud83d\ude05 (in a good way?)\n\n**My flavor of k-drama is the meandering, deeply insightful and deeply sincere, very character-based Slice of Life**. Think: anything Shin-Lee (Reply 1988, Hospital Playlist, etc.), Park Hyeyoung (My Mister, My Liberation Notes), Age of Youth, etc.\n\nEven as I try to venture into other international slice-of-life realms, this pocket of Korean storytelling has felt very unique (but welcome recs!). As a creator, I hold deep appreciation for it. I love how it makes me think on life, shows deep character relationships that reflect real life, and just plain endears me to characters so much more than a lot of shows.\n\nIt feels very antithetical to my Western industry and some of the (mainstream) storytelling truths it holds true: center conflict, maintain tension, make characters extreme personalities to exacerbate that tension. Not saying that's a definitive rule, but every industry has its dominant language.\n\nWhen I get asked by showrunners, execs, other writers a) what I've been watching recently, b) my favorite shows, and c) the kind of shows I'd like to be on, I always feel at a loss for words.\n\nBecause I want to write *that* kind of slice of life (not the American version like This is Us or The Fosters which to me still feels very conflict centered). I'm a child of immigrants, but not Korean--the aim is not thinking or wanting to replicate the SOL kdrama in its entirety. That's not possible in content or tonality for very obvious cultural reasons, and I don't want to appropriate. But that realm of drama still opened up a storytelling love/language for me that I seek to find here: one that values soft relationships, internal character growth, and watching characters grow together and contemplate life.\n\nIt just feels.....lonely? I still hope to find my ppl (I know they exist, it's just a matter of finding them), but I desperately want to have those in this industry see value in these stories I cherish so much. I want to be able to answer those questions\\^ honestly without getting the response of.....well, that's not very useful here is it. I want American storytellers to get out of their bubble a bit to just see/appreciate the many ways of telling a story that exist elsewhere (even if it feels a little different).\n\nAnyways, just some thoughts. Obviously one answer is not caring what ppl think and just doing your thing anyways, which is a path of growth I'm trying to be on. Hope to get there by the time I actually need to fight for my own show and how I want it to be.\n\nOverall would just love to know ppls thoughts, and then here's a practical question:\n\na) **are there any US based shows that come a little bit close to the comps I mentioned?** would love to have SOMETHING relevant to mention to ppl and watch/enjoy since it's been so long since I've fully watched a US show and enjoyed it. (ex. I started Res Dogs recently and quite like it, but still feel like if there was a show with slight more warmer feels, that may be more on point for me).\n\nThank you to this community for letting me air my thoughts \ud83d\ude05 **Are there any of you who now find it hard to watch a majority of American TV bc your tastes changed?** Let's commiserate together haha.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Are there any of you who now find it hard to watch a majority of American TV bc your tastes changed? \n\nMake that all of Western media in my case - I have been meaning to watch The White Lotus given the praise it has received and since its a genre I love, been meaning to finish last season of Breaking Bad (which I have loved so far) so that I can watch Better Call Saul also a genre I love and finally have been meaning to finish several British crime series that I have watched S1 of!!  But just cant seem to getting around to them.   \n\nI was recently wondering why -  havent yet found the answer....but I think what you mentioned regarding kdramas(&amp; in my case j-dramas too) focusing on relationships and contemplating life/values is possibly a large part of it. I usually watch crime/thriller kdramas which as well surprisingly have this aspect. I am currently watching a show which mainly has a \"thriller/mystery\" plotline, but is more so examining what justice means to each character, how far are they willing to compromise their values for what is important to them and the breakdown of a \"deep\" relationship when the characters find themselves on opposite sides due to a case.  In the hands of good actors, its a pleasure to watch such plotlines. I forgive plot conveniences here and there because of this reflective and relationship focused narrative.  \n\nI do wonder if it's a phase and I will move on, but its been nearly 3 years no change so far.",

Sometimes I wonder if the pandemic--which brought about all sorts of self-reflection--was a bit of the catalyst for me wanting to see more of that in what I was watching (as well as, for me, just lighter/more warm-hearted stories).\n\nAlso have been meaning to watch White Lotus! But yeah, just can't get myself to commit to any US series. I started The Last of Us--which I think past me would've rly liked--but alas....same issue, stalled after the first ep.\n\nI feel like a part of me is mourning my change in taste haha...like it feels like I've lost my appreciation for most Western series (for the moment) whereas I prob would've preferred just expanding taste, while keeping some US faves. But I look back on past things I've watched and wonder if I would like them now / how I could get back in the mind of past me who enjoyed them so much. But mostly I think I have these thoughts bc of how useful it would be to me career-wise to still care for US shows \ud83d\ude05.\n\nBut I guess 'things change, ppl change, everyone changes' \ud83d\ude05 My teenage tastes were always going to be different from young adulthood, from my mid-twenties... Given that taste is also oftentimes novelty, it make sense that the me that grew up on so much American TV would eventually start looking to other horizons.\n\nWhat's the drama you're referring to? Maybe I'll check it out :)",

The competition between handicraft and machine made. Construction workers not getting paid. \n\nBut of course not delving very deeply into these problems, for example my grandfather made some cupboards. They are very nice. They are probably hundred years old now. Why should I buy a new cupboard? Why should I cut down a tree to replace my cupboard? But the carpenter needs to sell a cupboard to make a living. \n\n\nThey can't fish in the large lake right there, but eat a lot of fish and meat without any discussion where it comes from (coast of Africa?). \n\nThere are some \"left-over\" women in the drama \u2013 how old are you when you are a left-over? It seems twenty to thirty percent urban women are single. You would think that they had enough single men to choose from. There is so much discussion about this in Norway too. As a side comment, the gender balance in Norway is close to that of China, thanks to immigration. Anyway, it is the men who complain about not getting a wife, and the social pressure is strongest for the women to get married here too, so the bottleneck must be the women.\n\nSome articles about it: \n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/leftover-women-in-china-contribute-more-to-gdp-than-in-the-us/\n\n( 41% contribution to GDP, but then you can quarrel about what GDP really means and how important the unpaid work of our grandmothers was.)\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21320560\n\n25% single women between 25 and 30. That is not what I would call a left-over age.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201804/chinas-leftover-women-and-shake-and-bake-husbands\n\nIt says many men in China will not marry women who are their equals, so that women with a PhD are referred to as the third sex. I don't know how good their sources are on this, if it is the men or the women who refuse the other.",

It's made me curious about my own country's status with this, and I have fallen into a well of statistics.\n\nWhat an uncomfortable position that must be -- educated and hard-working as your culture/family encouraged you to be, yet now stuck between cultural and economic expectations. It doesn't help that the government organizations appear to be sending mixed signals, as well. \"Left over\" is such a strange and slightly distasteful term -- makes me think of uneaten food. \"Shake and bake\" is worse. I know that shame can be a powerful social motivator, but why do terms for these situations always have to be so crass? Women might be more likely to get married with some respect involved. Why not be encouraging instead of shaming? Oh well, society is rarely logical in my experience.",

I am not sure if they dare to say it out loud, though. \n\nDivorce is such a big problem here. I am also divorced. I think divorce is a crisis, and that the discussion about it is not at all touching the important part: Why do people divorce, and can we do something before they start to think about it? I haven't been able to find good Norwegian statistics, but I think it usually is the woman who wants to leave. All married people I know, the woman does way more housework than the man, but I don't think the man always knows or cares. Invisible and thankless work.\n\nSomeone yesterday on Facebook showed a long list of articles with subject \"this should be curriculum in school\" (to save the world and solve every problem we have, including learning chess). Let me add to the list: Some Korean dramas should be curriculum, so that people learn a bit to look after each other. (Not a very serious suggestion.)",

Even if attitudes on a woman's place are different these days, it seems like it's hard to break generations of habits. (It's US-centered, but [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/) is a really interesting breakdown of singles' interest in dating/marriage. The chart about 1/3 of the way down breaking it down by age and gender was enlightening for me.) I also wonder in my individualistic society if we aren't bothering to teach the skills of discussion and compromise. You hear things like \"marriage is hard work\", but no one seems to expound on that.\n\nI finished watching **Love to Hate You** yesterday, which was mostly just a fun show (rather than a social commentary), but the leads were very interesting to me and i think it fits very well into this topic. Neither were interested in a serious (or any) relationship and were very distrustful of the other gender. The FL had lots of agency that she kept throughout the show, and was uninterested in marriage. The ML was painted as a woman-hater at the beginning, but I found him to be blunt but honest, and her was mostly holding women to the same standards as men. I'm still digesting it, but it was a welcome change from the routine rom-com gender roles and attitudes.",

A majority of older women (71%) say they aren\u2019t looking to date right now, compared with 42% of men 40 and older.\"\n\n\nAs an older woman, I am not very surprised. I really don't feel like being someone's servant.

(Of course, I was also a delinquent so.)\n\nLike since this is about relationships, let's consider the huge elephant in the room that is beauty standards. Almost all women whether they adhere to it or don't, know just how much value is demanded from them in physical attractiveness, moreso than the men it's meant to benefit (literally how many guys know wtf they're talking about when they say \"I prefer natural idk why women obsess over makeup\") and for men, most of what they complain about not meeting is height standards, something you pretty much have to just accidentally end up with.\n\nCause after all, most men around the world don't do much of anything to try to look better on purpose. Because they are, not just in this aspect, but in pretty much all aspects, taught they're supposed to be worth enough without trying to appeal to others. When I saw a guy ranting about how average men aren't sought after when men can just do with average women I immediately knew he was an ignorant shithead because that's obvious, women on average know they have to strive towards being of value to others to be noticed. Men don't, its supposed to be a given because idk human decency to give people a chance or whatever. Anybody prone to an inferiority complex has to bring others below them to keep that idea up.\n\nIt's not school that makes them like that but pretty much everyone and everything accessible, even in this world of male kpop idols being so desired they have stalking problems as a given there's still people going around (in the US at least, supposed bastion of equality and freedom it is) assuming if a dude uses makeup or cares about fashion this points to him being gay. One of my guy friends straight up complains he *can't* find interesting clothes more than half the time because grey grey black grey brown beige and a hint of blue on grey on fabrics that almost all look the same counts for what men look right in.\n\nHousework isn't just invisible work, it's unpaid work as wives, putting them in a dependent position to rely on the money of the breadwinner, who in turn effectively becomes who actually retains power in the social system, it is entirely through his permission they are going to use that money. It would have a lot more value if housework and childrearing was paid for by the government (and some countries like Singapore *really* want people to get married, they won't be giving you affordable housing otherwise) since ultimately it is important work for society to sustain itself.",

I think ROY was good in the beginning and was a more serious take on the subject of fame and dating than LTHY, which was more exaggerated in its humor.\n\nBut oh man, what a study in contrasts in the OTPs! The couple in LTHY was so affectionate you could really feel their relationship, and the opposite was true in ROY. Park So-Dam was so adorable in **Cinderella and the Four Knights** (which I just watched), and she's just neutered here. The romance built so well in a slow burn until the confessions, and then nothing! I *think* there was a clip in one of the montages where it maybe implied that they're sleeping together, but after they confess, they haven't even kissed for like five episodes! Whereas in LTHY, the FL wouldn't put up with that! \n\nAnyway, reading old threads about ROY it soundslike it doesn't get better and ends badly. I'm already a little uncomfortable with the gay panic plot line (especially after ML and SML in LTHY are so adorable practicing love scenes together) so I think I might take a pass.\n\nAlso l rewatched **Island** to be caught up and it's a fun, entertaining fantasy action with fights and feelings. Maybe I will start **The Fiery Priest** after this!",

I didn't like Weightlifting Fairy Kim or Extraordinary You, so I thought that I wouldn't like this drama. I didn't like either of the leads' characters in those dramas, and I mistakenly thought it was their acting. I was so very wrong. This highlights to me the importance of good writing and a good cast. \n\nSh**ting Stars is adorable, but not overly cloying. It has some very serious themes, and handles them well. It's also hilarious. The main leads are a great couple. They have chemistry. The male lead adores the female lead. I love that they have a good relationship and healthy communication",

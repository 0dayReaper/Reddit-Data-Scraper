The part I remember was that the brother was adopted and later on into the drama he revealed to his siblings that he could not be their brother anymore because of how he was treated by the parents. They were all surprised because they thought he was loved the same as all of them and then he reveals subtle things that made him feel adopted like the mother separating him from his sister as he grew older etc. Does anyone have any idea what drama this was?",

I don't remember much but I do remember the girl being in a hotel, the lights go out and she's sent back in time. She was in a dinosaur onesie I think or some other kind of onesie. I remember her on the roof of the building in the onesie as well. But that's about it. Does anyone have any idea what I might be thinking of?\nI think I remember the guy love interest blowing up next to his car in a suit with flowers?\nMight have been in Mandarin as well\nI'm not completely sure if this was the same show, but I remember some bad guy who was after the girl? Like he had somehow figured out how to go back/forward in time to get her?\nI remember the bad guy went back in time to his house, he sees himself as a kid and comes in. He locks his dad up in like a tub or something? And the younger version of him starts to really question what he's doing. Pleassseee help me lol\n\nShe doesn't go back centuries, she only goes back in time a few years or only a small bit of time.",

It's a comedy about a very small company of a handful of employees who work in a small office building with other companies on different floors. A young man comes to work at the company. A lot of the show takes place inside or outside the office building - it's pretty small and only a couple stories from what I remember.\n\nThe plot of the first episode is that main characters are fighting over a parking spot in the parking garage with employees from a different company because each feels like it \"belongs\" to their individual companies, and they get up to hijinks in order to stake their claim.",

I believe the main points were: the main guy works at a convenience store where an old class mate and aspiring K pop star (main girl) comes in. The main guy has a crush on her. Basically he also writes songs, and he wrote a song for the main girl. Theres a particular scene where, as he is composing the song in his room.. his little sister helps him... and they sing the song. I believe the song is successful, as the main girl's company wants her to sing the song but eventually want another girl to do it. Though the main guy had given the rights to the main girl since he wrote the song for her.\n\nThat's all I can remember.",

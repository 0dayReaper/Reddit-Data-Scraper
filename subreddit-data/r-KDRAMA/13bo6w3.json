As of now, Dr. Cha seems to be going the Reborn Rich route in terms of ratings, so it'll be fun to see where it ends at.\n\nIt's curious that Dr. Romantic is losing traction, and I wonder if that controversial actor is part of the reason. He made me tune out of Dr. Lawyer even before I heard about his real-life issues",

Episode 6 is currently the lowest rated episode so far and it is comparably poor compared to what ratings Episode 6 earned in the prior 2 seasons. But, it's still considered good enough by my standards given it's more than 10%.",

I was really hoping this season would have been more focused on Kim fully training Woojin to be his successor and slowly putting things in place for his retirement. They really didn't need an antagonist this season. I suspect most people were hoping this would have been a fanservice season where we'd see everyone returning and working together.",

Not popular by any stretch of the imagination, Dae Yeol\u2019s only real joy comes from his time spent with the archery club. A talented archer whose skills have earned him a scholarship to the school, Dae Yeol doesn\u2019t mind being an outsider, so long as he\u2019s free to pursue his greatest passion. But an ill-timed run-in with a devilishly handsome classmate lands him in trouble and places his precious scholarship in jeopardy.  One of the school\u2019s most popular students, Jo Tae Hyun has always enjoyed a level of freedom that very few high school students have ever attained. Able to get away with practically anything, the entire school has no problem believing his side of the story when he\u2019s caught fooling around in the nurse\u2019s office with another student and Da Yeol. Claiming Da Yeol was trying to make out with him, Tae Hyun thoughtlessly puts the archer\u2019s scholarship at risk. Desperate to correct the misunderstanding, Da Yeol does everything he can to try to quell the rumors but no matter how hard he tries, it\u2019s just not enough.  Completely unremorseful about what he\u2019s done, Tae Hyun seems to take a wicked sort of delight in doing everything he can to make Da Yeol\u2019s life miserable; his favorite method being to follow Da Yeol everywhere. Unable to shake Tae Hyun, Da Yeol spends his days loathing his shadow but the more time he spends with him, the more conflicted his feelings become; leaving him to wonder, where exactly does the line between hate and love end? \n* Director: N.A.\n* Screenwriter: N.A.\n* Teaser/Trailer: [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFbB52wpaiM)\n* Streaming: Viki\n\n[D'Live TV' DMZ Daeseongdong](https://mydramalist.com/733069-dmz-daeseongdong)\n\nPremieres **March 15 (Wednesday)**\n\n* Cast: Kwon Hae-sung (*The Devil Judge*), Jung Hye-in (*Graceful Family*), Lee Hwang-ui (*Youth of May*), \n* Synopsis: An action-comic human drama about what happens in South Korea when North Korean soldiers who win the first prize lottery of 52 billion won defect from North Korea. \n* Director:Im Chang-joo (*movie \"Hyun Soo Story\"*)\n* Screenwriter: N.A.\n* Teaser/Trailer: [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D88H7kN6EDs)\n* Streaming: N.A.\n\n[TVING' Unintentional Love Story](https://mydramalist.com/732133-unintentional-love-story)\n\nPremieres **March 17 (Friday)**\n\n* Cast: Cha Seo-won (*Second Husband*), B1A4' Gongchan (*Dear My Name*)\n* Synopsis: When Ji Won Young's direct superior at work is fired due to a corruption scandal, Won Young - in spite of being innocent of any wrongdoing - finds himself unceremoniously discharged from the company as well.

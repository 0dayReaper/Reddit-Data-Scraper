She rather shamefacedly responded to liking romance shows - quite often Spanish language ones as she can speak the language. I immediately told her I was right on board with that and asked if she'd ever watched any K-dramas. She hadn't.\n\nWe fell into the K-drama rabbit hole.\n\nFast forward to the next barbecue and she immediately approaches me for more recommendations having devoured CLOY, etc from the Netflix stable. \n\nThe only fallout I got was from my mate with an accusatory, \"so you're the one who got my wife onto these.\"",

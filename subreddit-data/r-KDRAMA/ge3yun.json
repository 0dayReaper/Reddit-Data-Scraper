I love Kim Go Eun and she's the main reason why I'm watching Eternal Monarch right now. I can't wait to see what all of the actors put in the near future!",

I cringed through the \"historic scenes\". Am I the only one? I barely made it through the first episode. I find it unwatchable after the first episode. Should I continue on with the next episode? Does it get  better?",

It looks simple but I can tell you are disciplined, because your brush strokes are clean, and that's only possible through studies and practice.  \n\nMy only nitpick is that the overwhelming amount of gray in this painting feels rather unsettling, as if there is a giant shadow looming over this lovely couple. It feels unfinished, more accurately, undecided. I guess this can be a play on the actual drama depends on your creative mindset. Personally I would've loved to see this exact painting in a brighter setting or a rainy setting.",

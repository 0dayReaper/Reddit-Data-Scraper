    "postText": "I watched this drama this week finally after it was released close to a year ago.  It is one of only two Kdramas currently available on Disney + in the U.S. and I think a lot of people may have missed it when it came out because Disney didn't put in on their platform for international audiences until much later. If you can find it, try giving it a watch! \n\nTL;DR: This relaxing romance tells a friend to lovers story about unrequited love through music, photography, mandarins, makgeolli, and tarot cards. While the leads' chemistry might leave something to be desired, if you enjoy romance, you won't be disappointed by this 4 episode short and sweet drama that never veers into unnecessary side plots. \n\nPremise: Lee Eun Soo is a lyricist struggling to write an emotionally meaningful song about unrequited love. She just doesn't get it; why can't this person just say how they feel? That is what is explored in most of this drama; why can't her best friend of 19 years (not 20 as they point out any times!), Han Sun Woo, tell her that he has been in love with her for 8 years? Sun Woo, a photographer, moves in with Eun Soo to help her write the lyrics as he tells Eun Soo he has experienced unrequited love with a woman abroad, Jennifer. Sun Woo has decided he is going to tell Eun Soo how he really feels before he goes abroad again in 2 weeks time. \n\nWhat I liked:\n1. The narrative is totally focused on the romance: A familiar complaint about romance dramas are unnecessary side plots that take away from the main romance. Not so here. In Soundtrack #1, there are only 4, relatively short episodes (I think all of them clock in at under an hour). All of the focus in on our main couple as they try to decide what their friendship is and what it should be. \n2. Music and photography: I will admit (please don't hate me) that I really dislike when lyrics to songs are translated on screen. Here, however, they really add to the overall story as the lyrics tell important parts of the story to us. Instead of having the characters talk to us about how they are feeling or thinking, the lyrics tell the story for us. Also, because the FL is a lyricist, it weaves her occupation nicely into the narrative. I also liked how photography was used to show how much the ML cared for the FL. Where and how he chooses to focus his camera demonstrates how he can't get his mind off of her. There are also other recurring symbols like makgeolli and mandarins that tie together well and serve good purposes in the narrative. Overall, these  just make it feel cohesive and well-written.  \n3. A love triangle with a purpose: There is a love triangle developed but it helps to explain why the FL is hesitant about  &gt;!being in a relationship with her best friend. She lacks the courage to go for it. As the tarot cards will say, she needs to have a determined heart. Props to Han So Hee for her subtle acting. When her character is with PD Kang, she visibility shrinks, hunching over and neglecting to mention that the things he keeps giving to her, she doesn't like. But when she is with the ML, she is relaxed and bubbly. The love triangle highlights how the ML allows her to be herself and truly pays attention to who she is. He doesn't assume that she likes what he likes, instead, he carefully listens to her and pays attention to her.!&lt; And also, props to Park Hyung Sik. No one does unrequited love, friends to lovers like him! \n4. Nothing innovative but it does everything well: This is a well developed, believable romance. We've seen this story before, so nothing is new but it's well executed. I tend to like tropey romances when they are done well and this one fits the bill. \n5. Bonus point: a cameo by Seo In Guk! \n\nWhat I disliked:\n1. A lack of chemistry: I'm sure plenty of people that will disagree with me on this. I think perceptions of chemistry are personal but I don't think Park Hyung Sik and Han So Hee had great chemistry together. I think they had good chemistry but not great. If they had great chemistry, I think this would have made this drama a 10/10 for me. I enjoyed both of their roles and think they are both good actors, but I think you really need to have fabulous chemistry to fully sell a romance that is only developed over 4 episodes. \n2. A much hated trope: &gt;!forced separation.!&lt; Towards the end of the drama, the ML &gt;!gets an opportunity to work with a famous photographer and leaves for a long period of time.!&lt; This is my lease favorite trope, HOWEVER, I think it actually works in this drama. It isn't just used randomly as it typically is in most dramas but instead serves a real purpose. We get to see the parallel between when he left for his &gt;!military service 8 years ago when he realized his feelings for her and her coming to realize her feelings for him when he leaves again in the present day.!&lt; \n3. Why doesn't Seo In Guk sing in this drama???? He plays a singer in his guest role but he doesn't sing. In a drama about music! Why? Just why? \n\nYou might like Soundtrack #1 if you enjoyed:\n1. Romance is a Bonus Book \n2. Our Beloved Summer \n3. Yumi's Cells \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about Soundtrack #1 as well. Thanks for reading!",

A 4 ep format involving friends-to-lovers trope is a solid success formula but this series was let down by Disney+. I agree with all your points except the chemistry because without chemistry friends-to-lovers trope becomes bland and the leads had a solid one at that.",

            "comment": "Lovely review! And overall I agree. Just a few things I would add.\n\n1. I think the decision about \"chemistry\" was deliberate. If it had been any different, it wouldn't have taken her 8 years to figure it out. And there is no denying (at least for me) the chemistry in the last scene!\n2. In lots of romances, there are things I have to overlook, assuming the intentions of all involved were good. That said, &gt;!if I came across a hard drive on the computer of my best friend - whom I assumed had been as open and honest with me as I had been with him for the duration of our longstanding friendship - and it was filled with hundreds of pictures of me, that wouldn't feel good. It would feel icky. And 8 years? Dude! Take the leap or move on. There is a line between longing and creepy and you are walking it.!&lt; While both of those are plot points, neither one is a major focus of the drama, and if you just ignore those two things, it's a beautiful portrayal of a lovely relationship.\n3. I loved the juxtaposition of her oblivious bluntness with his gentle supportiveness. They are so different and yet work together so well. It was really nice and I really wanted these two to find their way to each other. I was surprisingly invested in their romantic relationship for such a short drama.",

That felt very believable, how awkward it was.!&lt;\n\nI definitely see what you are saying about the photos on his computer. For me, it worked because he is a photographer and she can kind of be seen as his muse. If you notice all of his other photos are landscape, I don't think I saw any portraits. Except for her, which I thought was a nice touch; he doesn't see anyone except her. \n\nYes, I loved the romantic development between the two characters. It felt organic in how they eventually got together, which is a testament to how well it is written.",

Thanks! \n\nI figured the writers had included it because &gt;!they needed something for her to stumble upon that would start to shift her thinking  from considering him as a friend to considering him as a love interest. I just wished they had chosen something less, oh, idk, obsessive, but it was hard for me to imagine what that might be.!&lt; \n\nSo I rewrote it in my brain. Given how open and honest their relationship was in so many other ways, I would have had them having a discussion about her lyrics, and longing, and love in all it's many different forms. Then, he would do something thoughtful for her, she would appreciate it, and he would say. \"Of course I would do that for you. I love you.\" And she would say, \"Me too. Wait. You mean you love me as a friend, right?\" And then he would give her one of those long kdrama looks, and then, well, you can imagine the rest.",

            "comment": "It is one of my favourite show of the genre, short and sweet to the point. I might have a speculation of some of your points on 'dislike', you can think about it!\n\n1. 'a lack of chemistry' -  I will not choose to talk about the chemistry between Park Hyung Sik and Han So Hee, but that personally, he had much better chemistry with Park Bo Young and also Han Hyo Joo, whom he had a line with in a show released just before Soundtrack No.1. Therefore Park Hyung Sik - Han So Hee may fail to shine in comparison in comparision to his previous partnership with other actress.\n2. 'Forced Seperation' - I see it differently actually. You can tell that the Male Lead is interested in furthering the relationship with the Female Lead, but that the Female Lead is not reciprocating his advances. From the POV of the Male Lead, the Female Lead looked to favour the relationship with the Producer, which in the Male Lead's eyes, looks like too big a risk to ask her out. Therefore he decided to make do with his current friendship with her and moves to progress his career instead. It can be argued from the flashback that they probably had feelings for each other but is mistaken for other feelings but thats for each viewer to decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally i feel that the show can be much better if the meetup at the last episode after a year could be a bit different, instead of going back to the house, if they meet up for a first time in a while at the restaurant may work much better in bringing out the relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: it has been a while since i have seen the show, and my memory may be inaccurate, update me if i am inaccurate.

Its a beautiful drama indeed from friendship to lover and man being hesitant to express thinking he might spoil the friendship and keeping it to himself for many years. Love the cinematography as well. Yep hope it was in another platform like Netflix to have a greater audience. Short yet impactful. Hope the drama was longer to bring the better side of chemistry. Maybe due to its shortness, there was a little bit lacking on that side. But i think its not on the actors, as they are one of the best but on the direction. Highly recommended and guess what its a happy ending!! Ad you will really feel great watching this.",

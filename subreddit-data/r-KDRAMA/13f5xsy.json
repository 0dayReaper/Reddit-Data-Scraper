            "comment": "**Solomon's Perjury** (2016) (School/Slice of Life/Legal): High school students take the law into their own hands after being ignored by the administration and hold a trial investigating the death of one of their classmates. TW: &gt;!bullying, suicide, domestic abuse!&lt;\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The genre blend. Part murder mystery and part school slice of life with a legal 'trial' as the bridge between them, it pulls off the balancing act with only a few minor hitches.\n* The layered relationships. Bullying/abuse take many forms - the overtly physical, the slyly social and the manipulatively emotional - and they all play out between different characters.\n* The lack of PPL. Least amount of annoying PPL outside of a sageuk.\n* The social critique. The bullying/abuse starts with the students, but the story also shows how the same dynamics are ingrained in adult lives; with the implication that the behavior is ignored/tolerated in children because it's omnipresent.\n* The sympathy for the devil. The characters here realistically nuanced - they make bad choices, but care is taken to show that doesn't make them inherently bad people - and a few have satisfying redemptive arcs.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The cheese. Since it's a teen drama for teens, there's some overly wholesome asides that feel a little hamfisted. Ditto for a bit of over-dramatized drama. \n* The cinematography. The downside of almost no PPL; it's a plain and simple small budget drama.\n* The instrumental OST. It's too punchy and dramatic at times, which takes away from the overall more thoughtful tone.\n\n**Spotlight On Because:**\n\n* It's a great watch as a beginner legal Kdrama because the students are learning the basics of law as they plan their trial and it's less technical than a courtroom drama; but there's still plenty of narrative tension and twists.  \n\nIt's an 8.5/10 from me. Recommended if you enjoy dramas that interrogate bullying as a societal ill vs focusing on punishment or revenge, don't mind some feel-good idealism and are looking for something a bit different than the standard legal thriller.",

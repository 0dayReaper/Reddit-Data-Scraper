But while Wang Kyung Tae was attracted to Oh Young Sim, she wasn\u2019t so keen. Regardless, he was always around, making his affection for her known. Then, his family abruptly moved to the United States, and the duo lost contact with one another. Twenty years later, Oh Young Sim has become a TV producer who makes variety shows. Although she always tries her hardest to score a ratings hit, her TV shows almost invariably **TANK** (just like this drama) \u2013 and get canceled! Oh Young Sim hopes to turn over a new leaf when she is given the opportunity to create a pilot for a new romance-themed entertainment show. She decides that she will do whatever it takes to make the show successful. Oh Young Sim wants to cast a hot, eligible bachelor in the show. As such, she decides upon a startup CEO named Mark Wang for the role. But when he arrives for the filming, she suddenly realizes that he is none other than Wang Kyung Tae \u2013 all grown up...and exceptionally handsome to boot! What will happen when these childhood friends must reunite after all these years?

They\u2019re now just tapping into what happened during their younger days with the high school couple. Even the typically swoony scenes between them did nothing for me like the &gt;!watching her sleep and touching her hair.!&lt; im the biggest romance fan there is but this show might just be one of the worst I\u2019ve watched \ud83d\ude2c\n\nEdited to add ep 8 thoughts",

I gave it a chance a little longer than I expected because some of it was 'funny bad' rather than just bad bad but it started veering back into 'just bad bad' territory for me starting on ep5. Like literally nothing makes sense, the acting is highschool english project level and the editing is something else. I'm kind of weirdly fascinated by the show though almost to the point of wanting to force myself to finish just because nothing this shockingly awful has made it on TV in many years as far as I can remember.",

I can't stand ML's acting here (has he been in anything else?) he does this weird head bobbling/jaw tensing thing that gets on my nerves like nothing else and seems to serve no emoting purpose.  \n\n\nI keep trying to force myself to watch this because I'm just so curious where they will go with it and some of the entertaining moments have been very entertaining (in an 'omg I can't believe this is an actual TV script' way) but I keep getting stuck because some of the scenes are so cringe I can't keep watching. The writing IS indeed truly the crowning glory of badness on this show though, it's unbelievable.",

He's from one of the original big kpop groups and the group as a whole gives me the ick (don't come for me super junior stans!). I just think he's had too much plastic surgery so his face feels off to me.  But otherwise he's fine. I do think the 2ml is adorable and he's setting up well for a great KDrama career - wouldn't be surprised if he starts leading in a year or two.\n\nMDL says the show is only 10 eps so if it wraps up next week it'll be one of the silliest shows I've ever watched. It might not have great writing/editing but there is something weirdly heartwarming about it - something that other shows constantly lack. So I suppose I'm oddly a fan lol.",

I didn't even realize the ML was from Super Junior but that actually makes sense. I find him highly unattractive (don't think it's the plastic surgery though, just something about his face) but that's not what bothers me, it's his acting. If you rewatch the first few mins of ep2 you will probably know exactly what I mean because it's the most egregious example, but instead of actual emotion or even just acting 'normal' he spends a lot of the show kind of... waving his face around and tensing his jaw up? I actually had no idea why he was doing this until you mentioned he's an idol, but now you mention it, this is the exact 'peackocking' thing they make idols do in music videos to show off their jaw and nose profiles. It's just this weird 'look at me tensing and flexing my face at various angles' thing that no human being would do in reality in any situation, but it's so incredibly distracting and offputting to watch I can't believe the director just let him keep doing it for long periods of time throughout the series.  \n\n\nI kind of know what you mean about the oddly heartwarming aspects - I think maybe it's the setup with the family and the general 'lightness' of the show that made me want to like it - but I think it could have been done much much better.   \n\n\nAgree about 2ML, I think he will go far.",

It's not that either though it's like they've been literally obsessed with each other for 2 decades which is what makes it really strange.   \n\n\nBut also IDK if the show could be redeemed anyway because so many other aspects of it are bad.",

I truly find this show borderline unwatchable but I was so desperate for a 'light' show to watch I tried to slog through and imo it gets worse, not better, overtime.  \n\n\nWith the short eps you could try it yourself and see though.",

Why did the writers and promoters advertise this as a romcom then? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThen again, this is a show that never really knew where it wanted to go in terms of storyline \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso, THERE'S STILL SO MUCH STORY ARC THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED!!",

Mr Sunshine was likely the first drama I watched where I actually found the PPL cute. \n\nAfter that, I got curious as to how period dramas get their funds since I hadn\u2019t actually noticed any PPL in the period dramas I had watched before Mr Sunshine. Fusion/time-travel dramas not counted since PPL can come in during scenes set in modern-day.\n\nAnd my curiosity found me this article that includes mentions of lots of clever not-in-your-face PPLs in various period dramas: https://thedissolve.kr/why-is-the-time-travel-trope-so-common-in-korean-period-dramas/. \n\nFor anyone who isn\u2019t bothered to read the entire article, the main gist is that period dramas are often funded by the local regional governments (to promote tourism to their regions) as well as manufacturers of local specialty foods (for which PPL comes in, albeit in very cleverly disguised ways).",

Kinda a fun game to have to seek out the \u201chidden\u201d PPL rather than it being in-my-face all the time. Tee hee.\n2. If the period dramas can write the PPL in so well, then why aren\u2019t the modern-day dramas doing so? (Though yes sometimes they do, but it\u2019s really seldom)\n\nAlthough after watching Be Melodramatic and Because This Is My First Life and seeing how hard Jin-joo and Ji-ho respectively had to work to come up with creative ways to write in the PPLs, sometimes throwing in the towel and just force it in in order to make the deadlines, or how Han-joo (in Be Melodramatic) had to run around to get the PPL food in piping hot, persuade the actress to eat on-screen, convince the director to include it, etc., it kinda has made me sympathetic to no longer get peeved by seeing yet another Subway or BBQ chicken meal in my dramas. \ud83e\udd17\n\nEDIT: \u201ckeeping my eyes peeled\u201d, NOT \u201ckeeping my eyes open\u201d lmao obviously my eyes have to be open to watch a drama #brainfartmoment",

Back when it was on air I had already been watching K-dramas, but alas, back then I was only interested in rom-coms starring young actors and actresses around my age - think Goong, Boys Over Flowers, Dream High, City Hunter, lol. And since watching a drama required much effort back then (an episode in SD/HD would take hours to download over torrent - I\u2019d just leave my laptop on overnight for it haha).\n\nThe platforms I have access to watch dramas legally are Netflix and Viu and I haven\u2019t seen King of Dramas on either of them. It\u2019ll be great to finally get to watch it, since I\u2019ve heard how good Kim Myung-min was in it.",

(Slaves were used to extract and import sugar from sugar cane to the West.) Maybe that was in the West but then sugar cane plants are native to Asia!",

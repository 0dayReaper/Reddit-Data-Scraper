This also helps me to comply with the 40K character limit that reddit imposes for posts. Take note, however, that imgur posts do not have spoiler tags. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2)** I\u2019m not sure now if it\u2019s because of Ha Ji-won or of Kim Yoo-jung that I first saw Song Hye-kyo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile reading some articles about \u201cEmpress Ki\u201c back in 2014, I read that Ha Ji-won appeared in a drama about Hwang Jin-yi, the most famous gisaeng in Korean history. From there, I came across the [2007 movie \u201cHwang Jin Yi.\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ksm6s7Sno) Or maybe, after watching \u201cDong Yi\u201d in 2015, I was going into a deep dive into Kim Yoo-jung\u2019s dramas and came across the \u201cHwang Jin Yi\u201d movie; Kim Yoo-jung played the very young Hwang Jin Yi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy whatever way I came to watch \u201cHwang Jin Yi,\u201d two things immediately stood out in my mind within the first 12 minutes of the movie: (1) it had some great fight scenes, with Nomi the male lead character throwing a beautiful axe kick, and (2) the actress who played the title character Hwang Jin Yi was so strikingly beautiful. It was only after watching the movie that I found out the title character was played by Song Hye-kyo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, there\u2019s something else that stood out. Kim Yoo-jung was so adorable at age eight!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Song Hye-kyo as adult Hwang Jin Yi; Kim Yoo-jung as child Hwang Jin Yi](https://preview.redd.it/mlj9xt1b1dya1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6dbbba6ccd0640c8d9c31cb74f9d817c73aeb0ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, there\u2019s something else in the movie that was strikingly beautiful. In the final scene of the movie, Hwang Jin Yi climbs up a beautiful mountain range and from there &gt;!scatters Nomi\u2019s ashes!&lt;. I found out later on that the mountain range is Mount Kumgang aka \u201cGeumgangsan\u201d or the Diamond Mountains. All throughout the Joseon Dynasty, Geumgangsan was a pilgrimage site for the royal family, nobles, scholars, and artists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3)** While watching Hyeon-nam being abused by her husband, I remembered reading many years ago the 1979 book \u201cThe Battered Woman\u201d by Lenore Walker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4) Mangoes in the Philippines:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIn The Glory,\u201d the Philippines is mentioned at least three times:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;(a) Myeong-oh threatens Jae-jun that he will expose his shady business dealings, one of which takes place in the Philippines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(b) Hyeon-nam\u2019s abusive husband tells her that after getting the blackmail money, they can live in the \u201camazing\u201d Philippines and enjoy its cheap mangoes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; (c) As Hyeon-nam scatters her husband\u2019s ashes into the sea, she tells him about the mangoes in the Philippines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish that K-drama writers won\u2019t have a knee-jerk reaction of using the Philippines whenever they need a place where criminals can escape to or for some other shady things. What the Philippines is in reality is so different compared to how it\u2019s portrayed in Korean dramas and movies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(a)** In the YT video [\u201cSolo trip to the Philippines, which was said to be dangerous\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0G6Brb5BXB4) (591K views), a Korean travel vlogger named \u201cjangteacher\u201d mentions how watching the K-drama \u201cCasino\u201d aka \u201cBig Bet\u201d made her anxious about traveling to the Philippines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see in jangteacher\u2019s other videos about her solo travels in the Philippines uploaded two to three months ago, her negative perception of the Philippines has changed a lot. [Among the 163 videos in her channel, the most popular is her video in the Philippines of swimming with the whale sharks and finding the Avatar waterfalls; it has been viewed more than 862K times since she uploaded it two months ago.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HH_R3quVoHk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(b)** The \u201cHello Dumaguete\u201d YT channel features the everyday life of a Korean family (father, mother, a daughter, and a son) who immigrated to the Philippines about a year ago. The parents wanted their children to learn English and to avoid the high pressure educational system in Korea. In one of their videos, the parents were surprised that, unlike in Korea, there is no rigid hierarchy among students in Philippine schools; older students play with and are friends with younger students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \u201cHello Dumaguete\u201d channel has gained more than 14.6K subscribers in less than a year. [One of its most popular videos shows the children (Hye-won, the daughter, and Ju-won, the son) joining a city-wide parade; the video has 63K views.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wUUOjs62s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And oh, this Korean family enjoys the sweet and inexpensive mangoes in the Philippines, which they can easily find even in roadside stalls.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFK1AoIf-g&amp;t=4m44s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. (1)** Visual symbolism of the cross created by the light streaming through the gym curtains behind the young Dong-eun; **(2) Part 1, Ep. 4: Dong-eun crawls away from Yeon-jin towards the \u201ccross\u201d \u2014 Kim Eun-sook\u2019s most powerful symbolism of the futility of believing in religion or believing in a Deity or deities?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe Glory\u201d has numerous religious symbolisms (Eden Apartments, Devil\u2019s Trumpet, serpents, etc.) and dialogues such as that of Dong-eun in Part 1, Ep. 6 where she said that  once upon a time, she believed in all the gods, kneeling in front of them, praying for salvation, and clinging to the smallest of hopes. But she realized that everyone is just pretending that God or the gods exist. In Part 1, Ep. 5, she mocks Sa-ra\u2019s belief in God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChristianity\u2019s most easily recognizable symbol is the cross. In the following images, you can see the cross created by the light steaming through the gym curtains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Top: Myeong-o drags Dong-eun towards Yeon-jin; Bottom: The young Dong-eun with Yeon-jin and the other bullies.](https://preview.redd.it/rualrh1x1dya1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8a6b07c2db0bb6d3f828185653b6a25b99da4d64)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Part 1, Ep. 4, Dong-eun is brutalized yet again by Yeon-jin and the others. **She starts crawling on her hands and knees towards the gym door \u2014 towards the \u201ccross\u201d \u2014 to escape, to seek salvation. But due to her injuries, she collapses and fails to reach the door.** Notice the cross-shaped pattern of the light streaming through the gym curtains. The cross-shaped pattern becomes more pronounced by the rack focus; the pattern is at first out of focus and then becomes in focus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6mzu3g642dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201c10 Brilliant Symbolism Examples: Symbolism in Screenwriting\u201d:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Symbolism is a device used across literature, art and film. But arguably, film is one of the art forms where symbolism can have the most powerful effect. Films can contain symbolism examples that express complex hidden meanings and stay with the audience long after the film has finished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant resource: [\u201cWhat is Symbolism? Definition, Examples in Literature &amp; Film\u201d](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-symbolism-definition/) (Studio Binder) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. The most brilliantly composed shot in the whole drama?** Part 1, Ep. 1 Dong-eun &gt;!comes back to the gym to confront Yeon-jin and the other bullies!&lt; \u2014 visual cue and foreshadowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2nq663c2dya1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fa21ec987842c53c93feed0f06ff14c1ba38a81d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see in the picture above that the students in the gym are divided into two groups. The group on the left is composed of Yeon-jin, Jae-jun, and Sa-ra; the group on the right is composed of Dong-eun, Myeong-o, Hye-jeong, and Gyeong-ran. The blue line on the gym floor is a visual cue that depicts the conflict or division between the two groups, &gt;!between the haves and the have-nots!&lt;. The blue line dividing the two groups also foreshadows the time when, &gt;!through Dong-eun, Myeong-o, Hye-jeong, and Gyeong-ran will turn against Yeon-jin!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant resources:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201c25 Times Movies Foreshadowed What Would Happen, And Yet We Had No Inkling At All\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201c20 Ingenious Moments Of Foreshadowing In Films\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[\u201cWhat is Foreshadowing \u2014 Definition, Examples in Film and Literature\u201d](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-foreshadowing-definition/) (Studio Binder) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C.

Posted below are excerpts from that imgur post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) Breaking the 180-degree rule or crossing the line to depict or reinforce emotional or psychological tension, or to signify a change of \u201cbeat\u201d:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI discussed in detail what breaking the 180-degree rule aka crossing the line is in my discussion titled [How \u201cMy Liberation Notes\u201d used \u201cbreaking the 180-degree rule\u201d aka \u201ccrossing the line\u201d to create emotional or psychological tension in a brilliant scene from Ep. 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/vbj98p/how_my_liberation_notes_used_breaking_the/). Here are two examples of breaking the 180-degree rule from [\u201cHeat\u201d](https://imgur.com/rtrLOIl) (blockbuster 1995 action movie starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro) and from [\u201cParasite\u201d](https://imgur.com/emWsYYt) by Bong Joon-ho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Part 2, Ep. 7 of \u201cThe Glory,\u201d Dong-eun asks Yeo-jeong why &gt;!he had listed himself as the legal guardian of So-hee\u2019s mother even before they met on the train (Part 1, Ep. 3)!&lt;. At the beginning of the OTS (over the shoulder) shot, Dong-eun is frame left while Yeo-jeong is frame right. The camera trucks (moves parallel) to the right such that Dong-eun becomes frame right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/h5oj5l9r2dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) Shooting against the light, with or without lens flares \u2014 a character is shot with the sun or a light source behind him/her \u2014 to depict or reinforce tension, crisis, or to indicate a pivotal moment:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of this technique is in Part 2, Ep. 5. Dong-eun &gt;!finds the letters that the killer has been sending to Yeo-jeong, describing how much he enjoyed killing Yeo-jeong\u2019s father!&lt;. As the camera pedestals up, the sunlight behind her blooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/awtstys13dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 4: Myeong-o &gt;!decides to help Dong-eun in her revenge against Yeon-jin!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/4rvq2yp83dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe flashback scene in Part 2, Ep. 7 is perhaps the best image from \u201cThe Glory\u201d where shooting against the sun or the light source is used to indicate a pivotal moment. &gt;!We can see Dong-eun sketching the houses, with no burn scars on her legs and arms!&lt;. The sun shines brightly in the background while her sneakers and uniform are drying in the foreground. &gt;!Things become dreary when after meeting her friend Gyeong-ran in the hallway, she bumps into her bullied self, and her innocent self disappears. With her burn scars now visible, she tries to help Gyeong-ran, who walks away from her!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gj84s0zf3dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3) Handheld shots or shaky cam:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [\u201cThe Handheld Shot in Film \u2014 Definition and Examples\u201d](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/handheld-shot-in-film-definition-examples/) (Studio Binder) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What is a handheld shot?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A handheld shot is a shot taken with the camera being supported only by the operator\u2019s hands and shoulder. Handheld camera work entails camera shake from the operator\u2019s movements. According to the hand held camera definition, the shot relies only on the operator\u2019s body. However, over time as cameras have evolved and grown, operators have utilized a few rigs to achieve the same effects of a handheld shot.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Depending on the camera\u2019s weight and size, operators also utilize minimal rigs such as a shoulder mount or easy-rig to ease the physical burden of an operator as well as give them more control over the amount of camera shake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why is a handheld shot used?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- To establish subjectivity  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Heighten intensity or chaos  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Create intimacy between the characters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 5: At the church, Dong-eun mocks Sa-ra\u2019s belief in God; Sa-ra retorts that Dong-eun is being blasphemous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xj12au6p3dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 7: Yeon-jin barges into Siesta\u2019s fitting room to confront Jae-jun. &gt;!But Jae-jun has already confirmed through DNA testing that Ye-sol is his child!&lt;. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/losgw4q14dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 2, Ep. 6: &gt;!After being unnerved by the shaman, Yeon-jin turns around and sees Dong-eun!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2u9ekk884dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 2, Ep. 5: &gt;!After having been forced to resign from her teaching job, Dong-eun confronts her mother!&lt;.

In \u201cThe Glory,\u201d there are several shots where a character subtly goes from being long sided to being short sided, or vice-versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 2: On a river bank, Dong-eun thinks about her planned revenge against Yeon-jin through her unborn child (Ye-sol). From being short sided, she becomes long sided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 4: Dong-eun speaks sternly with Ye-sol and her classmates about not bullying others. From being short sided, Ye-sol becomes long sided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(5) Pan, tilt, pedestal, arc shot, pull out, or rack focus to reveal another character in the scene or to reveal the setting, thus changing the scene\u2019s dynamics:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cHow filmmakers manipulate our emotions using camera angles and movement\u201d:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The effect of the pan and tilt is most often to guide our eyes and attention towards a certain aspect of the scene. Because it\u2019s often revelatory in nature, it tends to build a certain kind of anticipation in us as we subconsciously ask ourselves \u201cWhat\u2019s about to happen?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1, Ep. 2: At Siesta, Myeong-o tries on a hat and looks at himself on the mirror.

Posted below are excerpts from that imgur post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) Transition by match cut or match dissolve**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [\u201cMatch Cuts &amp; Creative Transitions with Examples \u2013 Editing Techniques\u201d](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/match-cuts-creative-transitions-examples/) (Studio Binder) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cA match cut is any transition, audio or visual, that uses elements from the previous scene to fluidly bring the viewer through to the next scene. They also have the ability to do so with both impact, and subtext. They differ from regular cuts because they provide a thematic connection between two separate events or concepts.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Studio Binder article also discusses the different types of match cuts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Graphic Match Cuts \u2014 shapes, colors, compositions  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Match on Action Cuts \u2014 action, movement  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sound Bridge \u2014 sound effects, dialogue, music\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant resources: [Graphic match cuts from classic movie \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d by Orson Welles](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-r0b_XeRkG4) and [Match Cut: The Art of Cinematic Technique](https://vimeo.com/188527960) (Vimeo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) Multiple shots stitched together, making them look like one continuous panning shot**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Part 1, Ep. 1, Dong-eun works at a small restaurant. The camera pans clockwise around the restaurant as the seasons change. (I don\u2019t think this was done in camera; in post production, several panning shots were stitched together and given a cross dissolve effect.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ta063ss66dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3) J-cut: most commonly used editing transition in this drama**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a J-cut, the audio from the next scene begins playing even while viewers can still see the image in the present scene. For example, in Part 2, Ep. 5, as Yeon-jin &gt;!raises her voice at Chief Shin Yeong-jun after he says that he didn\u2019t bury Myeong-o\u2019s body!&lt;, we, the viewers, hear the call&gt;! from the police dispatcher to the police officers in their squad car to investigate a dead body that has been found on the street!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother example: In Part 1, Ep. 2, &gt;!Dong-eun and Yeo-jeong are lying near each other in the hospital!&lt;. Even as we, the viewers, still see the image of&gt;! Dong-eun and Yeo-jeong\u2019s hands!&lt;, we can already hear Mendelssohn\u2019s wedding march. In the next scene, Yeon-jin and Do-yeong have just gotten married.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F. Miscellaneous observations: (1)** Song Hye-kyo\u2019s standard clause in her contracts requiring the use of ALEXA cameras in filming her; **(2)** Central framing; **(3)** Camera roll to depict or reinforce Hyeon-nam\u2019s terror at the prospect of being beaten up again by her abusive husband; **(4)** The symbolism of shoes in the movies; (5)  Wide angle shots to show Dong-eun opening up emotionally?; **(6)** Nitpicking observations about (a) Yeon-jin being filmed from behind during critical scenes, (b) the unimaginative transition from young Dong-eun to adult Dong-eun, and (c) the sometimes confusing editing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) Song Hye-kyo\u2019s standard clause in her contracts requiring the use of ALEXA cameras in filming her:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 2016 article \u201cALEXA in South Korea\u201d states that Song Hye-kyo has a standard clause in her contract that she can only be filmed with an ALEXA, which is the top of the line camera brand for cinematographers. For example, the Alexa 65 model has been used as \u201cthe primary system on over 70% of the top 100 grossing films since 2016.\u201d Some movies that have been shot with an Alexa 65 are \u201cSkyfall,\u201d \u201cSicario,\u201d \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d \u201cRoma,\u201d and \u201cParasite.\u201d (Wikipedia) For Song Hye-kyo\u2019s drama \"That Winter, the Wind Blows,\" an ALEXA Plus  was used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther things that the article discusses include the use of an ALEXA XT camera in \u201cScarlet Heart: Ryeo.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) Central framing aka center framing:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn numerous shots, the cinematographer center frames the character, as you can see in the GIF below. By center framing, I\u2019m not referring to dead center framed shots like that of Wes Anderson\u2019s movies; if the character is within the middle vertical section of the Rule of Thirds, that\u2019s center framing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lqtzkq9o6dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3) Camera roll to depict or reinforce Hyeon-nam\u2019s terror at the prospect of being beaten up again by her abusive husband:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Part 2, Ep. 3, Yeon-jin mocks Hyeon-nam that her abusive husband will be coming home soon. The cinematographer uses a camera roll to depict and reinforce &gt;!Hyeon-nam\u2019s despair of failing to see her daughter off at the airport!&lt; and her terror at the prospect of being beaten up again by her abusive husband.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3xn6nxju6dya1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4) The symbolism of shoes in the movies:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know that &gt;!Yeon-jin, Dong-eun, and Hye-jeong all had the same green high heeled shoes!&lt;. &gt;!While craving for drugs, Sa-ra paints a huge image of a green high heeled shoe!&lt;. The opening credits also feature these shoes prominently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was intrigued by what those shoes symbolized. But Kim Eun-sook has stated that the shoes don\u2019t symbolize anything. That\u2019s a total bummer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant resources:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201c18 Shoes From Movies That Were So Iconic, They Were Basically Another Main Character\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe Most Iconic Shoe Moments in Film\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe symbolism of shoes in the movies\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(5) Wide angle shots to show Dong-eun opening up emotionally?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn at least two shots, it seems that Dong-eun was shot with a wide angle lens. My theory is that this was the director\u2019s way of showing that Dong-eun was opening up emotionally to the kindness and affection shown to her by Yeo-jeong and Hyeon-nam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(6) Nitpicking observations about **(a)** Yeon-jin being filmed from behind during critical scenes, **(b)** the unimaginative transition from young Dong-eun to adult Dong-eun, and **(c)** the sometimes confusing editing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(a)** In the scene where Yeon-jin finds out that Dong-eun is Ye-sol\u2019s new homeroom teacher, there\u2019s a wide shot of Yeon-jin with her back to the camera. This shot should have been edited out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(b)** Part 1, Ep 1 shows the transition from the young Dong-eun to adult Dong-eun. &gt;!At the textile plant, the adult Song-hee calls out to someone, and when that someone turns, we see the now adult Dong-eun!&lt;. It\u2019s such an unimaginative transition. I\u2019ve seen more imaginative and memorable transitions in K-dramas such as \u201cThe Moon That Embraces The Sun,\u201d \u201cThe Flower in Prison,\u201d \u201cDong Yi,\u201d and \u201cA Tree With Deep Roots.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(c)** In Part 1, Ep. 2, there\u2019s a nighttime shot of a house with the address \u201c70 Semyeong.\u201d The next shot, also at nighttime, shows a mansion, which we find out later on is Do-yeong and Yeon-jin\u2019s mansion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought all along that Dong-eun &gt;!has been rummaging through the garbage bins in front of Do-yeong and Yeon-jin\u2019s mansion!&lt;. When Dong-eun pieced together that &gt;!shredded document!&lt;, I thought that &gt;!Chairman Kim Shin-tae!&lt; was somehow related to Do-yeong and Yeon-jin. I checked some YT reaction videos, and the reactors also had the same misconception I had, that is, &gt;!Dong-eun had been rummaging through the garbage bins in front of Dong-eun and Yeon-jin\u2019s mansion.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, right after we see &gt;!Sa-ra painting the green high heeled shoe on her canvas!&lt;, the next image we see is a shot of someone wearing green heels scurrying away from the place where &gt;!Myeong-o lies bloodied on the floor!&lt;. I thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Did the killer return to the crime scene?\u201d It was so confusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy guess is that the director and editor of \u201cThe Glory\u201d wanted to emulate the [intentionally jarring editing style of Park Chan-wook in his multi-awarded movie \u201cDecision to  Leave\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=taW8RXZyzEY) (2022).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1)** As I stated in my previous discussions, I\u2019m a photographer, not a cinematographer or even a film major. Those of you who have better understanding of cinematography should feel free to correct inaccuracies or errors in this analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2)** This discussion is a bit long and at times quite technical. If you got tired reading it, you can energize yourself by listening to Band-Maid, an all-female Japanese band that mixes genres such as rock, metal, pop, jazz, and blues. Listen for example to [\u201cFreedom\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FHpuEqMAcDg) (anthem; watch out for the drum solo); [\u201cDaydreaming\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RCaeUkrItyY) (power ballad; watch out for the lead guitar solo); [\u201cWonderland\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x4hxLeHbqZo) (rock-pop-jazz-blues).",

I think I remember that there was an actual mall collapse in Korea.\n\nFor my next drama, I'm thinking of either \"Crash Course in Romance\" or \"Itaewon Class.\" I like \"Crash Course in Romance\" because its initials CCR (or is it CCiR?) remind me of the American rock band the Creedence Clearwater Revival aka CCR; the band's best song is \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\"\n\nWith \"Itaewon Class,\" I read somewhere that it has some great images that involve \"bokeh\" (the aesthetic quality of the blurred areas of an image).",

I think if you have a background in design or the arts, you would greatly appreciate the production values, design, layout and colours even of the trailer.\n\nRe the use of Alexa cameras for SHK's shoots, they must have used something else for The Glory? I think this is the first time SHK has appeared this \"unfiltered\" in any series? You could see her fine lines, wrinkles etc and ironically I prefer her with no filter and barely any make-up. \n\nIf the K Drama forum had a Baeksang, I would nominate you!",

It was fascinating to read about so many things I didn't notice.  I found the detail of the line on the floor &gt;!dividing the haves from the have-nots!&lt; particularly interesting.  \n\nI want to say, I've really enjoyed reading your other break-downs of dramas as well.  Thanks to you (from reading your Business Proposal analysis) whenever I see characters framed in a box or closed space I know what it means, which adds to my enjoyment and understanding of the drama!",

In doing so, he has become the forerunner of higher image quality in South Korean TV production.** Audiences and critics are hooked; \"That Winter, the Wind Blows\" has become the number one South Korean TV show, receiving multiple awards and prompting media coverage that focuses not just on the actors -- which is normal for the region -- but on the images as well.\n\n\"That Winter, the Wind Blows\" was Song Hye-kyo's 2013 drama. FMV at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1o4cJ74MtDk\n\nThe article continues:\n\n&gt;Kim also spent a lot of time explaining to the cast and crew his image and color concept. Hye-kyo Song, the female lead and South Korean star of both \"That Winter, the Wind Blows\" and the current Asian TV phenomenon \"Descendants of the Sun,\" was intrigued, asking many questions. Kim shot a number of makeup tests and discussed them in detail with Song. Based on those tests he developed a specific visual style for the show, carefully combining lighting, makeup, art direction and choice of lens and camera angle. **She loved the result so much that she subsequently changed her standard contract to include a clause stating that she must be captured exclusively with ALEXA.**\n\n[Emphasis by boldfacing supplied]",

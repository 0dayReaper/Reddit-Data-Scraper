The guests at Ihwawon Inn are scholars who came to Hanyang to take the exam to become a ranking official. The scholars at Inn Ihwawon includes Kang San (Ryeo Un), Kim Shi Yeol (Kang Hoon) and Jung Yoo Ha (Jung Gun Joo). One day, an unexpected case shakes their life. Yoon Dan Oh is offered the chance to have the debt on Ihwawon Inn wiped clear if she is able to find Lee Sool, who is the oldest son of the deposed crown prince. Dan Oh, Kang San, Shi Yeol and Yoo Ha attempt to find the missing man.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/The_Secret_Romantic_Guesthouse)",

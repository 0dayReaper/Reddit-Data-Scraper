Also shows us the patients life and how different people deal with diseases.\nAll of this with a tint of comedy and ROMANCE.\n\nThe casting in both the drama is top notch which makes it even better.\n\nIf you are looking for slice of life dramas then watch hospital playlist.",

            "comment": "I just recently finished Doctor John and I loved it! It\u2019s about a doctor who has a disease called CIPA, where he does not feel pain or sweat. FL is a resident in the pain clinic he directs at the hospital, and the daughter of the chief and the chairman (okay nepo baby) I thought the characters and plots were compelling, and I definitely felt like the leads had chemistry. It had the right amount of sadness without being depressing, and overall I just found it really well done and fun to watch!\n\nWhat I liked: \n- Ji Sung was SO good in this, honestly some of his best acting. \n- compelling patients\u2019 stories, you get invested pretty quick.\n- pretty solid backstory with Dr. Cha and the reason he\u2019s in prison in the beginning, interesting enough to keep me invested but not too convoluted or overpowering.\n- the relationship progression of the leads! I just loved how supportive they were of each other in their respective ways.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\n- honestly there\u2019s not that much\n- although I really didn\u2019t like that the mom looked like a 30 yr old with some gray hair dye. \n- the FL is super emotional. Like TOO emotional and she should consider a different profession lol\n- the hospital politics plot line was a little wishy washy and maybe not needed. \n- I\u2019m from a medical family in the US and the thought of a convicted felon who had his license revoked getting to return to a hospital and run a department is just too unbelievable but whatever Yoon Seri paraglided into North Korea so I guess anything\u2019s possible! \n\nI recommend this show to anyone looking for a solid medical drama that\u2019s not one of the more popular ones, I really hadn\u2019t seen this show rec\u2019d ever so it was definitely a hidden gem. And honestly just watch it to watch Ji Sung, he\u2019s just so freaking good in this!",

            "comment": "**D-Day** is my favorite medical kdrama by far! It's about a group of doctors dealing with the aftermath of a massive earthquake.\n\n**Good &amp; Interesting Things:** the acting is fantastic, the medicine is pretty accurate (triage tag system, needing to bag ventilate intubated patients if there's no power, resource allocation of local anesthetics and blood products, etc.), it shows the situation from different perspectives (firefighters, nurses, resident doctors, attending doctors, hospital administration, politicians), it focuses on vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the disaster like &gt;!a pregnant woman in labor, a Deaf child who gets lost, a child with muscular dystrophy who uses a wheelchair, a woman in a coma, a homeless man, a cancer patient in the hospital!&lt;, and it explores &gt;!providers acquiring PTSD from dealing with the disaster!&lt;\n\n**Bad Things:** the hospital politics can get boring, there's a decent amount of hazing and mild physical abuse of less experienced doctors by higher ranking doctors, and the &gt;!romance!&lt; storyline can feel tacked on\n\nOverall, I adore this drama and would really recommend it to anyone who likes a good medical drama without many cringy medical inaccuracies",

            "comment": "**Doctor Cha**\n\nCurrently airing with the two final episodes airing this weekend. I managed to catch up on the whole thing in a week and hope they give us a good, satisfying ending.\n\nPreviously I've only watched **Hospital Playlist** which is a completely different style of medical drama, going deeper into the cases, patients and side characters.\n\n**Good things**\nVery interesting plot that has been moving along at a good pace. FL has been put through the absolute most &gt;!liver failure and her husband refusing to donate, being treated as a house maid by her entire family, her husband having a long affair resulting in a child the same age as her daughter, working at the same hospital as both the husband and his mistress and both of them making her life difficult, the struggle of doing her residency at a later age than her colleagues!&lt; and she has dealt with most of them quite well.\nThe supporting cast are engaging and believable, her bff and 2ML are always great to watch.\nThere has been good progression for her son and daughter too which was necessary and nice to see.\n\n**Bad things**\nHer husband, omg this man is so much worse than he needed to be. Every episode he truly out does himself in terms of terribleness.\n\nThe age difference between FL and the actress playing her mom is so ridiculous. They're only 6 years apart irl and it's not at all believable unfortunately.\n\nA minor annoyance and possibly a controversial opinion, I dislike seeing this many key cast members with so much cosmetic surgery. I find it really distracting and it really stands out next to the other actors who have had less/look more natural.\n\n**Spotlight because**\n\nIt's a genuinely well made, exciting to watch drama. It's currently one of the top 10 highest rated series and I understand why. Everybody in this drama is so good. Here's hoping for a successful final 2 episodes!",

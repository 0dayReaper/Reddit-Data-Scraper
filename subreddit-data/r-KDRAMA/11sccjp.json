    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

I was surprised to see the very young Jung Kyung Ho (24) in it... He looks very different in the new Netflix hit \"**Crash Course in Romance**\" (39). He looks painfully thin in that series. He plays a character who is a workaholic and doesn't eat well. I've wondered if he purposefully lost weight for the role???\n\nAnyway, as a Lee Joon Gi fan I'm hoping this series stands the test of time and is binge worthy.",

However, I just couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to see Suzy, Taec, IU, etc early in their career. It\u2019s been a super easy watch.",

I did think the ending was rushed and a bit confusing at times but that's fine.  \n\nI really liked Ajumma.  She was hilarious.  I know the actress mainly as Eun Sang's mom in The Heirs so it was such a blast seeing her in this role.  I almost ordered gimbap for lunch today because of her...\n\nI am also now a fan of Ji Chang-wook.  I watched Sound of Magic but his character was too strange for me.  He did a great job in his role as the Healer and the rookie journalist.  I will now search for his other dramas to watch!",

I was so enthralled by the first episode that I needed a day to gather my thoughts and feelings after what I just witnessed and to be honest I still can't put them into words. It's too early on my journey with this show but it's episodes and shows like this that make me so happy that i've become such a fan of Korean dramas. I'm just super excited about what's to come and hope the show has a quality finish.",

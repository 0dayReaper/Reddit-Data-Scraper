It just feels like they have cut a bunch of scenes from a bunch of other shows and strung them together. Full of tropes but very little substance and a bunch of characters whom we can't really connect to the story. Like a pair of older men in some corporate room talking about some cco or I don't know what. Point is they showed up a couple of times and I just fast forwarded through it cause I could instantly tell it didn't matter. \nI do like the ML cause he looks good and mature and I usually love friend to lover stories so this is a real disappointment that it is so poorly written. Am going to keep watching because I like friend to lover tropes but not something I would recommend to anyone",

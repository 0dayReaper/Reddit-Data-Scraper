Have you been mesmerized by all the Korean food onscreen? Have you succumbed to the allure of the PPL? This post is to share with others what have you done this past month because of watching Kdramas and see who else is like you!\n\nShare things like:\n\n* Hours of sleep lost because you got [caught up in a binge!](https://giphy.com/gifs/mother-of-mine-kGiztx4M3fkVlfkQdz)\n\n* Korean food you ate or cooked -- advice about ramyeon flavors or soju is also welcome!\n\n* [A new hobby](https://i.redd.it/k7k3fwfs40e41.gif) you've picked up or a rediscovery of an old hobby you loved!\n\n* [The gorgeous coat](https://i.redd.it/sdx50o1gpgg31.gif) you bought despite living in a place without winter and other fashion choices!\n\n* Updates about your progress with learning Korean -- whether you are studying formally or just acquiring some basic knowledge through too many Kdramas watched!\n\n* Your new Dyson hairdryer or vacuum and other PPL inspired purchases -- Subway counts too!\n\n* Travel plans and anything else that comes to mind when you think of the phrase \"Kdramas Made Me Do It\"!\n\nShare only as much or as little as you are comfortable with, just remember to be respectful of others and their choices. Even if you hate Subway, others don't have to.

They have a nice format where you are introduced to a conversation after which they break it down for you.  I like it because they focus on listening and understanding and include romanization, which seems to be frowned upon by most other teaching systems.  I understand their reason, but for me, I want to focus on listening, not speaking, so pronouncing properly by reading hangul isn't a priority.  To be honest I doubt I'll ever get the hang of it",

I can't really test it out cause I'm not paying for it anymore but if I remember correctly from when I was paying (a few years ago now..) I think I was able to choose those modules so that I could practice reviewing only the listening components.\n\nEdit: the learning aspect of it (like learning new words) isn't selectable though I think.. like they teach you new words always in the same way.. I think it's once you learned the new words and you can review what you've learned that you can choose the type of review with the paid version iirc. I could be totally wrong though cause it's been a long time since I used the app.",

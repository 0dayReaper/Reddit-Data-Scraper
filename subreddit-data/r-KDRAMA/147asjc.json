            "comment": "**You Raise Me Up** \n\n**Good things** Focus on anxiety and depression. Anxiety is not a mental illness often highlighted as such. ML\u2019s anxiety in particular is specifically discussed; he surrounds himself with pink items to help alleviate his an anxiety and eventually we see why. Sexual dysfunction can be a symptom of depression and it\u2019s rare to see that featured on screen. ML\u2019s struggling with having anxiety and depression and his struggles to recover are realistically portrayed. ML also has body issues to overcome as he has scars he doesn\u2019t want people to see. \n\n**Bad things** The FL (urologist) and her boyfriend SML (psychiatrist) engage in unethical medical malpractice in how they treat ML\u2019s illness. Eventually both FL, and to a lesser extent SML, recognize that they are assholes but it\u2019s initially pretty awful. \n\n**Interesting things** The ML is not your standard kdrama ML in that he starts out a timid person and that never changes. He still has some self esteem issues though significantly improved. There are a lot of people like that in the world and it\u2019s nice to see one as a lead. \n\n**Spotlight on because** this drama is different from the usual with a low income character who stays that way, and learning to recover and live with issues doesn\u2019t mean becoming a different, glamorous, person. It\u2019s a comedy so some of the issues are played for laughs, but somewhat sensitively handled. If you can get past the idiocy of FL and SML in the beginning it\u2019s enjoyable. Also a drama that moved me to tears and that almost *never* happens.",

Drama with excellent perfomances (Jo In Sung will let you speechless during one particular episode) ; the style is a bit dated with lots of close-ups, the shouting is sometimes annoying and the ending is too fairy tale, but worth your time",

                    "comment": "This is without doubt the best mental health drama I have seen. Even the weakest episodes (13-15) could stand on their own, and were only weak because of the contrast with the assured storytelling in the other episodes; A weakness arising from &gt;!the inherent difficulties of humanizing a villain that had previously served the story well as a background fairy tale style villain, and was more impactful in the background than when chewing the scenery. (No blame to the actor)!&lt;. But the final episode 16 was a tour de force, so all is forgiven.\n\nI must say, though, that the psychiatric hospital had *seriously* slack security. :p",

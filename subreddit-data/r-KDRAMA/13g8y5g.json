Or Lee Dong Wook mopping the floor in Bad and Crazy.  Do men actually do household cleaning in Korea or is it like in the US where the women pull the majority of the weight in this area?",

Sales girl asks if she wants to test it and the actress does the usual swipes on her face and asks if it removes bad memories as well as it removes wrinkles.  I think she's early 20s.  :D",

            "comment": "I'm curious about the term \"our\" used with a name.  Like Our Won Tak.  I get that it indicates familiarity and fondness.  But is there a larger context?  Would you only use this term for family or can it refer to someone you are simply fond of?\n\nIn Dali and the Cocky Prince, Da-li refers to Won Tak as *our* Won Tak when referring to her brother (but not by blood) in front of her love interest.  Although there is some rivalry between the two men, I never see Moo Hak be jealous of Won Tak, as if he was a rival for Da-li's affection.  Even after discovering she had moved into his apartment when she became homeless. There never is a discussion between the two that explained that she saw him as a little brother and not a man.  So I wondered if this was simply an omission or if the fact that she called him *our* Won Tak indicated he was family to her.\n\nAfter that Moo Hak starts referring to him the same way, but it's clearly tongue in cheek and meant to tease.",

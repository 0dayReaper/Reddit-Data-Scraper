Very similar shows in that they are females struggling to get what they deserve in a male dominated profession and similar PR areas. Depending on how **Race** turns out **Agency** could almost be a sequel show as she starts out already established in the company.",

            "comment": "I feel sorry that this show is so poorly edited I guess. Like the soundtracks are off so it just doesn't carry well. I actually like the show and some themes like the whole thing about rebranding and the petty obstacles in their implementing an obvious solution, or of being in love with a friend and having to recover from it. Or I even like this idea that Jaemin is in love with a much older and more accomplished woman and just the realities of that. I feel like that could work only in a fictional world. In the real world, a CCO dating an assistant manager might seem predatory and she would be labeled a cougar or something. It would affect her credibility in the office.  I get that now that I am closer to her age than his.\n\nBut I like the show moderately. It isn't something I wait for but when am watching, I don't find myself skipping scenes and rushing through it.",

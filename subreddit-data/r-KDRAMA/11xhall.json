It did make the entire series more bittersweet, and as a result more memorable.  So maybe I am doing myself a disservice by avoiding shows that I know will end badly.",

Protective men are my weakness and that pretty much defined him. He not so much loved the FL as he felt responsible for her and for her happiness.  It reminded me of that famous part of the book [The Little Prince.](https://myriadicity.net/musings-and-amusements/musings/little-prince-fox-taming-story).  In that story, The Little Prince meets a fox and the fox asks that he tames him.  The moral of the story is that you are responsible for the things you tamed.  Like for the rose and the fox, Habaek became responsible for her.",

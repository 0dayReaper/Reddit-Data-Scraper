I loved the male in that role but she was a bit frustrating for me at the end. Probably cause I was used to watching the ones with younger female leads.

It has nothing to do with her being older than him.  I did not like in the show how indecisive the woman was.  In the show I specifically referenced I did not like where she allowed her mother to basically make her decision for her.  She never told her family what the guy they wanted her to be with had done to her, that he was abusive &amp; that it was the other guy who saved her time &amp; again.  She put herself in harmful situations for a phone.  Then when he wanted to move to the U.S. with her she basically made a lame excuse and didn't go.  She settled for another guy later on that disregarded her for work but her mom was happy.  Yeah she got with the guy she should have chose in the beginning but in last 5 minutes of series.  She chose unhappiness time &amp; again.\n\nThe other show One Spring Night I think it was called was another one where the female lead never committed.  She \"ended\" things with her fiance but kept entertaining him time &amp; again, sending mixed messages.  Her sister was abused but never said a word &amp; then the mom wasn't honest with dad when found out.\n\nI don't care how old the woman is in the shwos, but the dramas with younger women tend to have them want to be with the guy no matter what &amp; CHOOSE themselves instead of being over 35 &amp; still doing what their parent(s) want even if abusive to them rather than choosing happiness.",

But I have briefly read/heard about the challenges later on in the plot by which many are heartbroken to this day, so I have temporarily put the show on pause for now haha. \n\nI think it's hard - when you've grown up in a culture like that, always thinking that it's \"the right thing\" to listen to your parents, no questions asked - it's harder to fight back. Not justifying or supporting what Jin Ah maybe does, but I do feel for her. Maybe it was a way the makers were trying to point out how wrong that is to the audience and avoid having more people make the same mistakes as her? \n\nFunnily enough, I think _One Spring Night_ is by the same makers as _Something in the Rain_ but I haven't watched that one at all so cannot comment on it.\n\nBut u/needtostopcarbs, I would highly, highly recommend _Crash Landing on You!_ Yoon Se Ri (Son Ye Jin's character in this show) is an absolute badass - I love her with all my heart. She's cool, she's clever, she is incredibly mentally strong and resilient (which is very inspiring tbh), and she's funny, charming, but also very human. It's the first kdrama I ever watched, and then rewatched who knows how many times \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48 \n\nIt's available on Netflix, so hope you enjoy it if you do give it a shot! :)",

It's empowering too - that you should speak up for yourself, and fight for what you know is right for you. Demand better - something I know I can certainly take something away from.\n\nAnd hehe! A good binge is so fun!! You're in for a treat - I'm jealous. Would give anything to be able to binge CLOY for the first time ever. ..again \ud83d\ude02",

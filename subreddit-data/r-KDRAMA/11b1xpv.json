I'll have to be patient, oof this is why I need to not stop watching KDramas in between, my patience in life grows from watching KDramas haha where I've to patiently wait for the story to unfold. Also, watching Lee Se-Young in this drama as the Queen makes me want to rewatch **The Red Sleeve** all over again, aah her chemistry with Lee Jun-Ho was just off the charts!\n\nLee Jun-Ho reminds me of his upcoming drama with YoonA.

I loved it when Dong Shik showed up, it was the best moment. !&lt; It was slow and hard to watch at times (because of everyone\u2019s struggles) but I loved the characters and really felt for the interns and Manager Oh. The cast was so good. I knew Lee Sung Min was phenomenal but Im Siwan impressed me here. &gt;! Also, the glow up was real when he got a different hairstyle. !&lt; One of my favorite characters was Han Seok-yul, who added some much needed levity to the series while also undergoing a great character arc.",

I loved Goo Se Ra. She\u2019s fearless, quirky, charming, warm. I loved Goo Se Ra and Seo Gong Myung\u2019s relationship. They have a very sweet and supportive relationship. Supporting cast was great, especially the little boy, Kim Ja Ryong. Also, I really liked the visual style, like in the sets of Goo Se Ra\u2019s favorite place and the comic book store. My only small quibble was the ending felt a little flat to me.",

It was well done head to toe and probably the most solid property I've seen Lee Min-ho in. My only tiny nitpick is I found myself wishing the FL was more demonstrative with her emotions. The glimpse of it really add to the humor and it could've been raised a couple notches imo. Highly recommended it to my niece and her friends.",

I've been watching kdramas 4 years now, and it's been awhile since I've felt totally thrilled &amp; emotionally intoxicated with a drama, like I did in the beginning of my kdrama journey. Flower of Evil got me from the first episode, which is somewhat rare for me. The acting, the storyline, the OST, all superb. Each of the main actors were outstanding, but Lee Joon-gi was mesmerizing. What a compelling actor! completely inhabits his role. The way he conveyed the deepest emotions &amp; turmoil beneath a surface dispassion, I can't describe how moved I was &amp; how shaken my heart. I guess I'm a sucker for tsundere/damaged men. This was one of those dramas that I was completely invested in. And the OST! I had just finished describing to a new kdrama friend how I wasn't really moved by OSTs, the music was just background for me, but FoE OST had my emotions soaring &amp; regularly in tears, especially Shin Yong Jae's \"Feel You\" (there, I'm tearing up just thinking about it). For me, this drama was a definite10+ out of 10. I started to feel it going a bit makjang-y (not my favorite genre) around ep 11, 12 but then it picked up again. Every time I thought \"oh now it's complete, it could end here\", it went on another interesting twist. Highly recommended if you haven't watched it yet! And if any of you have suggestions for Lee Joon-gi's other roles where he shows this kind of range &amp; depth, please pass it on! I'm in withdrawal now.............\n\n(edit spelling error, slipped by me!)",

            "comment": "So, I wanted to start a new lighthearted drama, and decided on *May I Help You*. All episodes had been out for a while and it looked cute. I though to myself that the first episode was interesting enough, but nothing extraordinary. I clicked \"next episode\" to move on to Episode 2... but Episode 5 started playing. \n\nDon't ask me HOW, but I mistakenly started this drama by watching Episode 4, convinced it was, in fact, Episode 1. When I tell you I was SO confused... It took me a good few minutes to realize it was my mistake and not a glitch. I mean, everything made enough sense! And it genuinely felt like a first episode of sorts, like, I had no trouble understanding who the characters were and their relationship with one another. I felt really dumb.\n\nAnyway, I debated watching episode 1-3 but ended up reading a recap instead and continued for a few more episodes. I ended up dropping it, sadly, but I really needed to get this off my chest lmao",

The first half seemed like it was going to be a bittersweet drama, and I wanted to know how it ended so I kinda did a speedrun for the second half. Seems like the romance took a backseat (very far, in the very back) and the rest was rather painful and like, very sad.",

It lost my interest at the 3/4 mark while life heated up a bit ... but I got back into it, remembered why I was enjoying it so much and then prepared myself for the horrible ending that everyone talked about ... and the ending was actually very good. Everything got tied up well and I didn't find it rushed at all.\n\nActually, the whole thing was excellent imho. Constructed well. Exciting. Many twists and turns. Directed and shot well. With some remarkable performances from people that I don't usually expect to deliver great acting. But they did.\n\nIt's a solid 9/10 from me. Recommended.",

I'm not going to lie, it took me 'til the end before I finally had a \"guess\" on what the motives of the Queen Dowager are. Which comes down to two. Either she is 1) &gt;!drunk in power, and loved the game of thrones!&lt; or 2) &gt;!she wanted to be Queen because even if she made her son the King, she was never the Queen!&lt;\n\nDOCTOR PRISONER and REMARRIAGES &amp; DESIRES - I honestly think both of these dramas are good with exceptional acting. But I might have to give revenge driven plots a rest for now. The Glory made my expectations with revenge dramas soar high. Now I got annoyed when the lead character would go against the antagonist for that money shot of \"i will come and tear you down\" only not to prepare and be shocked that the antagonists antagonized them.",

            "comment": "**Strong Woman Do Bong Soon**\n\nI really enjoyed it, it was cozy and fun and then also hilarious and suspenseful. But I did have some stuff that bothered me or at least I kept wondering what other people thought about it:\n\n* In Guk Doo was insufferable. From the start he just treats Do Bong Soon terribly, yelling at her and brushing her off over and over. Later we will try to rationalize it but the explanation was weak and his entire arc is just unpleasant to watch and added nothing for me.\n* The mom was an actual bad person, even after they rationalized &gt;!the dad's bruises!&lt; she was still a really abusive person to her daughter and husband. She was straight up still acting like a thug, taking money from the business and bossing people around and hitting them, *which is literally why she lost her powers* and it was so weird that our main character is presented as a very moral and gentle person but she is being raised by someone who abused the powers so bad that she lost them *and then she never changed*. And even by the end, they try to soften her some but it didn't feel sufficient to redeem all her behavior.\n* The curse's rules seemed inconsistent when it came time to set up the final arc. The definition of the rules seem to shift a bit and become very focused on the idea that she &gt;!must never hurt an innocent!&lt; which seems pretty forced since she only &gt;!hurts the hostage by accident!&lt; and it doesn't even make sense because throughout the show she definitely does similar things earlier, for example is &gt;!secretary Kong not innocent? She puts him in the hospital with a pretty severe injury, just to get a job!&lt;. Also why does she never apologize &gt;!to the hostage!&lt; it was just really weird that we go out of our way to show Min Hyuk handling it, and expressing an apology isn't even part of resolving &gt;!her power loss!&lt;?\n* It felt like a lot of threads were set up and then never revisited? An Min Hyuk's family? It was actually bizarre how little the chaebols got involved in stuff, and as far as I could tell An Min Hyuk never resolves his family trauma, the last we see is &gt;!his dad making him feel bad in the hospital!&lt;\n* Other plotlines felt somewhat neglected. Mostly the best friend had a pretty ambiguous role, other than the big one. And similarly Jo Hee-ji had a lot of potential but then her later arc gets pushed aside and then I am not actually sure what her finale is?\n* And while I was being confused why we were neglecting some characters and plotlines, we would spend SO MUCH time revisiting Baek Soo Tak's crew for endless slapstick comedy? Like it was fun on occasion, but it got to the point where it seemed like his crew was getting equal screentime to the main characters??\n\nJust stuff I kept thinking about, but overall the main character was absolutely adorable and the male lead was so wholesome in his love and the main character's plotlines were so interesting and fun to watch, I really enjoyed this show.",

I suspected him starting from the second death (Young Min). It didn\u2019t seem like Hui-jae would do that because it was too obvious that the producers wanted us to think that. There were things like needing money (for the cats) that didn\u2019t add up for Hui-jae. And like why would he need to Google the force of a metal ball if he was already killing cats &amp; people? The mom found metal balls but no weapon. I knew Ji was the old student\u2019s brother when someone called him the wrong name &amp; said he lost weight. I was then sure he was the killer when one of the detectives investigating thought that he was familiar. They emphasized that the older detective was the same one that was in charge of Seong hyoon\u2019s family\u2019s investigation (linked to Choi Chi Yeol\u2019s student). We only really confirmed he was a psycho when he started butting heads with Nam Haeng Soon, like he wouldn\u2019t give her a high five during bowling and then later injured her on the boat.",

He liked how CCY used to depend on him for almost everything, because it allowed him to protect the one person his sister depended on. It's also because the old CCY would constantly lose sleep because he kept remembering his sister, hence the reason why he was upset when CCY said that he didn't have those hallucinations of her anymore.",

That\u2019s NOT our guy. \n\nAt the same time, I feel so terrible for Mr Ji. He\u2019s showing love in the stunted, abusive way his mother taught him: tormenting, stressing out, starving and depriving the love object for the greater good. It\u2019s awful for CCY that being a good guy and a good teacher meant he got fixated on by a psycho: it\u2019s awful for Mr Ji that abuse turned him into a monster.

But immediately balanced by the uplift of Hae-e's fabulous trio of friends making a beeline for the hospital.\n* \"That's what you want, not what I want. So tell me. Are you happy?\" This episode goes to some *dark* places. Seo-jin hitting rock-bottom, as revealed in the abhorrent thoughts that crossed her mind, and Su-a hitting rock-bottom as well.\n* Sun-jae heading to the school rooftop was another dark moment, but again balanced by the uplift of Geon-hu bringing his friend physically and emotionally back from the brink.\n* My heart was racing in the scene where Mr. Ji showed his true colors, and his misguided sense of justice. What's more, his identity was confirmed to be who many users suspected he was from early on in the series. The parallel with the Sun-jae/Seo-jin situation was gut-churning. But the twist in his backstory went to an even darker place.\n* Parallels were interwoven into this episode's narrative, with Hae-e's mother's return followed by Sun-jae getting in touch with his absent father.\n* Finally, Detective Chi-yeol has put all the pieces of the Mr. Ji puzzle together.",

                    "comment": "Reading over your list, I have to say I'm impressed by the ideas the drama is subtly putting out there-- particularly in relation to children/children's autonomy. There are lots of kids who experience educational abuse at the hands of their parents and the narrative is usually just \"hang in there until you're an adult\", which is insufficient, harmful, and places too much ownership of the issue onto the kids rather than the source (the parent(s)). \n\nKids deserve autonomy and power to protect themselves-- especially against bad parents. When they are denied both they turn into people like Hui Jae (who turned out so well but is in a personal hell because of the scars inflicted by his mother) and Mr. Ji (who has been hurt so long and deeply that he doesn't understand the value of human connection and inflicts unforgivable pain on others). Of course there are those who make it to adulthood and are then able to shed/heal the scars, but healing takes a lot of time, a lot of painful introspection, a lot of self research, and a lot of resources that aren't easily available. \n\nI usually watch Kdramas as an easy to follow, formulaic escape from reality, but I've been really enjoying the recent dramas that have been encouraging/presenting very thoughtful commentaries on the human world. The other great education scene I kept thinking of was the episode in Extraordinary Attorney Woo Young Woo with Mr. Fart in the court room. I bawled during that scene-- really hope people will look closer at education systems (in Korea but, honestly, necessary all over the world) and move to make changes in favor of human happiness (what an ideal!!)",

TBH I was on Dong-hui\u2019s side and not the law\u2019s or one of our cops\u2019 when it came to his mom. She abused his sister and him - it was her or him. Throw her off the balcony, idc. \n\nBut then, Dong-hui has no idea how to express love, and so he expresses it as his mother taught him to - starving the love object, depriving them of sleep and intensifying stress and overwork toward a mythical goal that surely will one day be worth it, look at all the sacrifice there must be a result for the sacrifice. \n\nI fear Hui-Jae and Sung-Jae\u2019s mother is getting a redemption, (though also a punishment)\u2014for not physically tormenting her kids, or modelling healthy enough care that they\u2019re still capable of care? But I think it\u2019s notable that Sung-Jae might get out OK because Hui-Jae lived on, despite his terrible mental health. They were both alive to care for each other and drag each other out of the pit. No blame at all to Dong-hui\u2019s brave, tormented sister\u2014only for the parents who were both scourge and desolation.",

This drama is one where I feel like if you continue to make more seasons then it the story will just be boringly dragged out. Just let it finish at its top peak, you get what I'm saying. So many dramas have to add unnecessary overused tactics like the near the end breakups for some stupid reason only for them to get back together or some professional moves to USA to study more. Like what? A doctor or lawyer moving to USA to study to become... a doctor or lawyer. I hope you get what I'm saying. Other shows are designed to have multiple seasons like the drama The Kingdom. It's great and also on Netflex and you should check it out. The ending of the season make it show another season can be created and it will be good and bring new info and content and not drag one singular story too long to be a boring and hated piece.",

She actually was?!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The first 20 minutes was just an endless stream of tears.!&lt;\n\nYeongju is a rock. &gt;!She gives me the feeling of a warm, dependable and understanding aunt. The whole Nam family trusts her, relies on her and aren't afraid of being vulnerable around her :(!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sunjae's questions to his mom really shows how little he thinks of her. There is a part of him that believes she genuinely could kill and could wish for someone to die if it would help her in reaching her goal. It's kind of insane to imagine how emotionless and insensitive she must've been for her son to believe she's capable of things like that... I hope she realizes this isn't the road to a happy future and that's she's about to completely break her youngest son...!&lt;\n\nAlso gotta say, I looooooooove the cinematics. Love the way they film, the transitions between scenes and the music. Everything is so pleasant to watch!\n\n&gt;!Hae-yi's in a coma and Su-a's mom is STILL gossiping about her?? Wow...!&lt;\n\nEven though I'm not hype on all the drama, I gotta say, I have really enjoyed these past two episodes. I hate conflict, but I also love seeing how the actors and actresses portray the complexity of their emotions through facial expressions, tonal inflection and body langauge.\n\n&gt;!Geonhu's voice broke when he told Sunjae to snap out of it :'( Geonhu's who's always so calm and carefree :(!&lt;\n\nOMG &gt;!the confrontation between Mr. Ji and CCY had me transfixed, such an amazingly tense scene! Loved it when CCY pointed out that the old him was barely a living being and that it was he, himself, who decided what was important to him.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Holy jesus, inviting Mr. Ji in was a risky move, really thought CCY was about to get a metal ball in his face. I'm so glad he now has seen past Mr. Ji's facade. But honestly, what a terrible discovery to have made...!&lt;\n\nThis episode didn't have the fluff I adore, but what an amazing episode, top- notch acting!\n\n*Editing with comments as I watch.*",

She actually was?!\n\nThe first 20 minutes was just an endless stream of tears.\n\nYeongju is a rock. She gives me the feeling of a warm, dependable and understanding aunt. The whole Nam family trusts her, relies on her and aren't afraid of being vulnerable around her :(\n\n&gt;Sunjae's questions to his mom really shows how little he thinks of her. There is a part of him that believes she genuinely could kill and could wish for someone to die if it would help her in reaching her goal. It's kind of insane to imagine how emotionless and insensitive she must've been for her son to believe she's capable of things like that...\n\nHe actually knows his mum pretty well. She herself admitted on the phone to his dad later that her thought was &gt;!\u201cI hope she just dies\u201d!&lt;",

As someone posted in the episose13 subreddit, the actual title of the drama in Hangul means \u201c one shot scandal\u201d. It alludes to the scandal with the education system in the background. I wish the English title was aligned to that meaning. Nevertheless, that doesn\u2019t take away the fact that it\u2019s a good drama with great acting, and important messages to the society. The insanely competitive  moms, psycho and entitled students like Sua, the cheating education directors who pass on exam papers to rich/influential parents.. all point to a broken system present in varying degrees in many Asian countries. If , as some viewers predicted , &gt;! Sua saw the kidnapping of Hae-yi but kept quiet becos she thought it\u2019s good riddance!&lt;  or &gt;!Sunjae wanting to commit suicide for something that is not at all his fault!&lt; \u2026.. then how insanely crazy is that? \n\nI have been through hectic academic pressure in the Asian country I was born in, and I can relate to this.

Yeonju is just a side character but she really is the backbone of the Nam family members. She is always the shoulder they cry on. Next favorite part is Geunho saving suicidal Sunjae. I am glad Sunjae finally did the right thing.\n\nI also like that CCY confessed to NHS about his suspicion about Mr. Ji and did not kept it a secret. But I was scared at the last part when he allowed him to enter his house. Their relationship took a backseat the last episodes but I really love that they are communicating even when they had a previous fight. Such a healthy relationship and I hope this two will be safe in the finale. We know CCY is the last target of that metal ball killer.",

            "comment": "**Episode 14**\n\nMuch MUCH better written and delivered today! \n\nThis is the level of writing I had expected when they had embarked on the journey of interspersing the various plots. I have never minded the murder sub-plot because I viewed it as a plot device. I still think they oscillate between the backdrop of education pressures/social commentary around that and overall mental health related criminal tendencies, and I think going in, personally, I thought the education related piece would always remain the main thing and the obsessive murder, a plot device, but somewhere along the way the balance threw me off because it wasn\u2019t the tightest writing. Hence the \u201clacking\u201d aspects in all the other bits became more glaring or felt like they weren\u2019t getting their due. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making sense but bottom line is I am VERY pleased with today\u2019s rebound. \n\nThey got so many things right, whether it was how short simple scenes reinforced what a healthy relationship amongst adults looks like (i.e &gt;!in the midst of madness noticing something off with your partner and asking about it without being over the top and in turn your partner being confident enough to share his suspicions with you - this is what I\u2019d been hoping to come out of the \u201cromantic\u201d moments between them!&lt;) OR whether it\u2019s showcasing what friendship-turned-family looks like with the platonic heartfelt &gt;!hug between Yeong-ju and Jae-woo. As a number of us have said, all for more representation for neuro divergent characters but the romantic angle felt shoe horned and without apparent reason when they\u2019d spent the bulk of the show building up a familial relationship!&lt; (she also gave him the right advice and safe space and for that I really appreciate her) OR whether it was showing us that most of the time friendship is the strongest foundation even if there\u2019s romance involved as seen with Geon Hu noticing something off with Sun-Jae and &gt;!following him, shaking some sense into him and making him feel better!&lt;. What a great friend. I hope they always stick together. \n\nAnd also, excuse my French, but effing FINALLY the stupid &gt;!Dad!&lt; has been called. I wonder what will come of that. In my eyes he won\u2019t get a pass for &gt;!showing up and fixing things, because where tf have you been dude? But I suppose it will at least make him marginally better than the Mom!&lt;. \n\nJKH was fantastic in the final 10 min of this episode. You can see him trying to process the myriad emotions he\u2019s feeling and your heart just breaks because as the audience we\u2019ve been privy but seeing it unfurl for him is very sad. \n\nNo preview for next week, eh?\n\nETA: As murder mysteries go there are quite a few minor yet convenient creative liberties taken this episode but can be forgiven because again that\u2019s not the main purpose of the show (eg: &gt;!why wouldn\u2019t Hae-e shout out to her Mom when she was that close to home or why whilst running no one ever seems to scream out etc. etc.!&lt;).",

The absence of fathers is definitely a very pointed choice and sometimes I feel the nuance of showing how wrong it is for men to absolve themselves of any responsibility in the upbringing of their children is somewhat lost in the show because we\u2019re being shown these extremely crazy mothers which can inadvertently reinforce the whole see women are the crazier more irrational ones narrative. And this is not to excuse any of their behaviours but in particularly patriarchal societies which are built on extreme competition and fewer opportunities for women, the zealousness to not have that repeat for their progeny can become counterproductive and dangerous, culminating in these types of behaviours and warped parenting styles.",

All of the women in the All Care moms group are married because having a child out of wedlock is still extremely taboo in South Korea. I saw an OECD stat that said only 5% of births in South Korea were out of wedlock. Heck, Haeng Seong made up an absentee husband in the Philippines to rid herself and Hae-E of the stigma of not being a traditional nuclear family. \n\nThere is so much to unpack here because it seems to be the case that there are a lot of married single mothers in South Korea who do all the childcare and emotional labor of their marriage. They make sure the kids are taken care of and put up a front for the world that all is well when it not, as in the case of Su-A and the firstborn Lee son who was locked away instead of abroad. The dads are conspicuously absent and only show up to blame the women, who are doing most of the work to make the family functional, for being overbearing.  The fact that Haeng Saeng could make up an absentee husband in the Philippines and no one batted an eye that this husband never showed up tells you that this is a serious commentary on Korean society.",

His mother was out of control, had been for a long time.  He told his teacher the truth and called his father laying their entire mess at their feet for them to fix.  He did the right thing.  This isn't really about rehabilitating the absent dad in the audience's eyes.

Mr Ji is a sweetheart at the start and I really wanted him to remain as Royal Consort Ji, but damn, the confrontations between him and CCY were insane this episode, and I do love some angst. \n\nShin Jae Ha portrayed his character so well, the number of times his mask slipped because of his growing frustration during his argument with CCY was so intense. Murder is obviously not justifiable, but I feel so bad for his character, he clearly still has a lot of unresolved feelings about his sister\u2019s suicide, and he got so messed up because of his mom. It\u2019s all the adults fault :(\n\nAlso, I thought he was going to murder CCY because of the betrayal he felt, so I was surprised at him showing up at his house and asking for forgiveness. But the moment he left, his face completely changed so yeah, I still think he\u2019s going to harm CCY next.\n\nI feel so bad for CCY too, dude cannot catch a break. His concealed anger when he shook Mr Ji\u2019s hand and found out it was him, as well as the betrayal that showed on his face at the end, JKH really delivered the microexpressions.\n\nAlthough I feel like I\u2019m missing something at the end, why did CCY seem significantly more hurt when he stalked Mr Ji and found out where he lived?\n\n\nAside from Mr Ji vs CCY, I really liked all the different subplots coming together this episode, especially how Geon Hu helped talk sense into Sun Jae and how Sun Jae\u2019s mom really started to reflect on how everything had gone wrong. Also, glad that we finally explore Su-a a little more beyond her random hallucinations, really liked how she had an emotional outburst towards her mom. Most of these characters really should be going to therapy.",

This episode was such an emotional rollercoaster. \n\nAll of you who called it - the younger brother growing up to be Mr. Ji - pat yourself on the back. I hope to reach this level one day and I do need to watch a lot more kdramas i guess? :) But, I'm not complaining :) \n\nMy main complaint with this season is the way they treated Hae-e's bio mom comeback. They made it so comedic? Why? Is it because this was a very heavy episode and they didn't want to further bring it down? Because it just felt VERY disingenuous to me - if my sistem came back after 10-12 years suddenly and lay claim to ...my niece who I've cared for all this while like my own child, I'd be a) Shocked b) Surprised c) Annoyed d) Angry e) Confused f) PISSED OFF. And even so, they barely showed the sisters interacting. I get it, it might've been due to anger or the distance, I'd have liked to see some truly pissed reaction from NHS for her sister. Instead, we got the heart breaking, \"because I'm not her real mom\" and I legit yelled at my screen, \"NO HAENG SEON, YOU'RE HER REAL MOM. DON'T SAY THAT BESTIE IM HERE FOR U\"\n\nAlso, i dunno if this was character growth for NHS but when the inspectors shut her down by calling hers a problematic family &amp; ccy stands up for her, she politely requests them to reinvestigate. I low key expected her to get angry and strongly ask them to reinvestigate but she just ...normally tells them to. Probably coz she's a lot more assured now that CCY is by her side? (During the JW arrest episode, she felt alone &amp; helpless so she cried and backed down. Now that she has CCY with her she's a lot more ...calm and foundational? Idk, I think she felt a lot more supported)\n\nI'm so glad they didn't get ML &amp; FL to breakup. But instead got them to grow closer to each other. ML admits to FL that he earlier didn't think much of Dong hui and then concedes to her suspicion. ML is also so smart, he followed him and everything.\n\n----\n\nALSO, CAN I JUST SAY JKH'S ACTING IS TOP TIER. LOOK AT THOSE EXPRESSIONS.\n\nWhen he dealt with Mr Ji in his cabin, the way his anger was restrained, you could see it as his lips parted. And then when they walked out and were LOUD with another - it was ...so real? I always get the feeling that in kdramas actors often overdo anger (case in point Sun Jae's mom when Hui Jae doesn't talk to her). And when he forgave Mr Ji you could TOTALLY see how he was faking it. HOW does that man do it???\n\nWe NEED more JKH showing complex emotions. We need more JKH being all loving and tender. WE NEED MORE JKH PRONTO. In all my previous comments I've been been praising him. I'm just glad we got to see his range in this drama, man deserves to be the ONLY and MAIN LEAD in a lot more popular stuff!\n\nI'll see you all for the finale! :)",

Then overhearing that she may have committed suicide..drove his guilt further. He thinks Hae e couldn't handle the stress and knowledge of the leaked test and instead of reporting it and getting sun Jae/mother into trouble she killed herself. That much guilt plus stress is a lot for a teenager to handle.!&lt;",

It was heartbreaking to see how many people have had their childhoods and lives ruined by the extreme pressure of society. I really appreciate when characters have layers to them and are not all black and white. I'm always impressed with a show can make me hate a character and then turn around and feel sympathy for them as well. It is the result of great writing and excellent acting, and this episode gave us both.\n\nAlso, I really need someone to just step and loudly proclaim that NSH is Hae-yi's MOM. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. She IS her mom and not this random lady who barged in after years of abandonment.",

Maybe that was the follow-up conversation CCY wanted to have with Mr Ji after the recording regarding the incident with NHS.

Thank God he finally called &gt;! his dad. !&lt; Or maybe not, it's toss up, there might be a reason why nobody ever calls him.\n\n\\- Su-a nervous breakdown and hopefully her mom realizing how horrible she is. I always had a sense that she truly cares for her in a way that is not as selfish as Seon-jae's mom. Hope the call to the &gt;! psychiatrist !&lt; leads somewhere. I'm not sure why, but I always felt for Su-a, so I'm wishing she'll learn from this and become a psychiatrist to help kids with trauma.\n\n\\- The arrest of the metal ball serial killer. This was by far the weakest plot of the series and it has taken over the second half. I appreciated all the additional detail we got today to see how the same patterns are repeating over and over again.\n\n\\- Hae-i &gt;! omma!! !&lt; Why did they have to bring this in? I know it was a loose end, but do we really have time for this now? I mean, &gt;! it's clear as day that she wants money. She ran out or broke up with the last in a long line of loser boyfriends. Are we going to find out who the father is? Do we even care? !&lt;  I'm pretty sure Hae-i will decide &gt;! to stay with NHS and CCY. !&lt;\n\nIn all this the real victim is romance. Romance is dead. I can't figure out how they can satisfactorily pull off the teen romance right now.... and NHS and CCY just need to go on vacation to Jeju or Hawaii to destress and recover after this is over.",

It was a really emotional episode.\n\nThoughts on the episode:\n- That whole opening sequence was terrifying. Mr Ji is seriously scary. \n- I teared up when NHS broke down at the hospital and when JW talked about how it\u2019s usually him making his family concerned or in the hospital and now it\u2019s Hae-yi.\n- I love how supportive CCY was and there for NHS and her family.\n- I liked that NHS kept believing that Hae-yi would\u2019t have tried to commit suicide and how she was smart in finding clues to support that.\n- I love the friendship between SJ and GH, how GH saved him and was the one to finally get SJ to reveal the truth.\n- Even though my heart broke for CCY I\u2019m glad there was finally the confrontation with Mr. Ji. I loved how CCY talked about what NHS has brought to his life and how he\u2019s changed for the better because of her.\n- CCY starting to piece together everything about Mr. Ji is great, but should he be investigating on his own? I was a little worried when they were alone together in CCY\u2019s house.\n- Hae-yi\u2019s &gt;!mom showed up!&lt; I can\u2019t believe they were able to stuff that into the remaining few episodes. &gt;!Interesting that she\u2019s been keeping tabs on Hae-yi, but why has she never show up before? She seems like quite the piece of work.!&lt;\n\nI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s only two more episodes left. I\u2019m not ready for the show to be over and to say goodbye to these characters. It\u2019s been really amazing acting by the entire cast, especially of course, Jung Kyung-ho.\n\nNo preview for next week\u2019s episodes?",

I don't know whose worse, Sua's or Sung Jae's mom. And now suddenly a new challenger appears in Hae E's real mum...\n\nAlso how did Mr Ji type the suicide note? Didn't he turn off the phone?

            "comment": "This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/11bewvl/crash_course_in_romance_episode_13/ja1dv0j/) made me shift my perspective.  This was wrongly advertised as a romcom skewing our expectations.  \n\nIt's starting to come together.  I think we were a bit unfair to the show because we kept looking at it wrong.  We wanted fluffy romantic moments and seeing the whole serial killer plot as unnecessary and \"tacked on\".\n\nBut I've now realized we were looking at this all wrong.  It's integral to the drama.  All the plot lines run in parallel and revolve around the harmful effect of the high-pressure educational system.\n\nMr. Ji is not a side plot but is integral to the story.  The conversation they have in episode 14 makes that clear.  Mr. Ji  was controlling CCY to the point where he had sucked all the life out of him, leaving CCY just a shell of a man.   The romance made him realize how empty his life was. But it was empty precisely because of Mr Ji's absolute control of it.  He turned CCY into a robot, just like the moms are turning their kids into robots.  The parallels are clear.\n\nSo this could not have happened had he been the good guy that he first appeared to be.  His support was actually the expert manipulation of a really accomplished psychopath.  \n\nThank you /u/fan_in_a_movie for your post which provoked a paradigm shift for me.  All the plotlines now make sense and I realize are integral to the drama.\n\nI can now enjoy this drama again, this time for what it is.\n\nPS.  Now that I think about it, we had lots of subtle hints about Mr. Ji's sinister nature early on.  Their interaction at the police station, after the metal ball incident, wasn't normal. We just laughed because we saw it as comedy, but if you remove the comedic layer, it simply was not a normal reaction from an adult man.  Mr. Ji had managed to make CCY depend so much on him, he had infantilized him.  I might have to watch that drama again with this new perspective.",

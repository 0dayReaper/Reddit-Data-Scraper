            "comment": "&gt;\"Joseon Attorney\" tells the story of an oejibu (attorney in Joseon Dynasty) \n\n**Portrayals of \"waeji bu\" (oejibu) in K-historical dramas:**\n\n**(1)** The whole premise of the blockbuster 2016 historical drama \"The Flower in Prison\" is that the MC (played Jin Se-yeon) becomes a \"waeji bu,\" specifically in Eps. &gt;!35-36!&lt; and later.\n\nFrom [\"Go Soo, Jin Se-yeon for MBC sageuk Flower in\u2002Prison\"](https://www.dramabeans.com/2015/11/go-soo-jin-se-yeon-for-mbc-sageuk-flower-in-prison/) (Dramabeans):\n&gt;\n&gt;The drama will deal with the Joseon legal system, in particular the people who argued on behalf of wronged citizens. They weren\u2019t government officials who handled lawsuits, but would help ordinary people interpret the law and handle lawsuits for them, in a time when the legal code was written solely in hanja and thus out of the reach of understanding for commoners. In essence, it was a precursor to the modern legal system, with lawyers serving as intermediaries between the people and the courts.\n\nPlease read my discussion titled **\"The Flower in Prison\": historical backgrounders for those who have not yet seen this drama** at https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/hnxlui/the_flower_in_prison_historical_backgrounders_for/\n\n**(2)** In Episode 60 of \"Dong Yi,\" &gt;!Dong Yi leaves the palace after her son is adopted by the Queen.!&lt; She turns her private residence as a welfare center for the poor folks in the city. To the exasperation of the local officials, she becomes a \"waeji bu\" in helping poor defendants.\n\nAt around the 12:19 mark of Ep. 60 at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bGdHiHVBFPk if you listen closely to the Korean dialogue, you can hear &gt;!Dong Yi!&lt; say the word \"waeji bu.\" [I don't read Korean, but the  subtitles seem to say something about the \"waeji bu.\"](https://imgur.com/mnHAvWN)\n\n**(3)** In Eps. 67-68 of \"Yi San\" aka \"Lee San, Wind of the Palace,\" Jeong Yak-yong (Dasan) is a Sungkyungkwan scholar who\u2019s frequently cutting classes. But later on, he becomes &gt;!Yi San\u2019s favorite official and the architect of Hwaseong Fortress.!&lt; Before he met Yi San, Dasan helped poor defendants with their legal cases for free. So he probably was also a \"waeji bu.'\n\nIf I remember correctly, in history, the \"waeji bu\" were banned from participating in the Joseon Dynasty's legal system after they became unruly and disrupted the legal proceedings. In \"The Flower in Prison,\" the MC and her friends revived the \"waeji bu\" to help the oppressed people in the capital. \n\n**B. Notes about the Joseon Dynasty's justice system:**\n\n**(1)** From [website of Korea\u2019s Supreme Court](https://eng.scourt.go.kr/eng/judiciary/history/history.jsp):\n&gt;\n&gt;Joseon had an even more sophisticated system, in which petty civil and criminal cases were handled by local heads of administration, while the governor of each province took care of the appellate cases in addition to the first instance trials of serious criminal cases. Royal secret investigators sometimes took charge of local trials, serving as a sort of irregular circuit court. Citizens who lost an appellate case against a governor were able to appeal to the central government\u2019s Ministry of Justice. The ministry handled civil and criminal trials in addition to general legal affairs, while acting as the final appeals court run on an agreement basis. Further, various government agencies carried out judicial functions: Saheonbu rectified false charges; Hanseongbu, the city government of Seoul, took charge of trials relating to family or real estate registration; and Euigeumbu handled crimes of the royal family members or treason.\n\n**(2)** From \"Notes On The Development Of Korean Law\" by Michal Tom\u00e1\u0161ek\n&gt;\n&gt;The Korean legal order of the Joseon period was elaborated on to great perfection in the sphere of criminal procedure. Criminal proceeding was governed by the principle of inquisition. The judge \u2013 the inquirer \u2013 centralized in his hand all procedural acts, and he himself collected all material pointing to conviction, but also to the defence of the accused, and he alone also made the decision in the matter. The accused was the passive party of the trial and his rights were very limited. The Korean judicial trial did not, in principle, have the form of a suit as is the modern accusatorial process, where the plaintiff is master of the suit (dominus litis).\n&gt;\n&gt;The main goal of the process before the court at the time was not to prove the guilt of the accused, which was presumed, but rather to obtain his confession.\n&gt;\n&gt;The court was supposed to obtain a confession above all with the aid of proof; if the means of proof did not suffice, even persuasive means of physical force were permitted. The degree of using physical force in obtaining a confession was mostly given by law or judicial precedent, but in practice it often depended on the volition of the court official.",

You get Kocowa's full catalogue and their subs are professionally translated; they're much faster with airing dramas and tend to be more accurate than Viki, especially if you watch law/crime/medical/political shows with tricky terminology.\n\nCereal/Youtube has a nice selection of Kdramas available for free. They're all older series, but if you're just looking for more content and not currently airing dramas it's a good no-cost option. Ditto for SBS World/Youtube, but you'll need a VPN to access it in the USA.\n\nIf you're internet savvy and have a VPN, Viu is the best no-cost option if you don't want to upgrade to Viki Plus/Kocowa. The free version is limited to 720p with some adds, but it has a huge catalogue of airing/older Kdramas and their subs are pretty decent.",

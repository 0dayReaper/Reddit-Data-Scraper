So it seemed like I was watching the same thing again with different actors.\n\nAlso, not feeling any chemistry between the two boys. They are both so different from each other in every way. YeChan is such an eager puppy, it's a given that Yeol will end up getting charmed despite himself. While YeChan's sweet nature may help Yeol 'heal', it's difficult to see them having a long relationship once the novelty wears off. I know I shouldn't be be looking for realistic relationship goals from a romcom, but their power dynamics are too lopsided at present. This is one show where I want to see a time leap of a few years.",

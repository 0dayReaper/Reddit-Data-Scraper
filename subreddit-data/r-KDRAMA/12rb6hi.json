    "postText": "Welcome to our **Spotlight On** post series where you can share your picks of dramas that deserve the spotlight! Each **Spotlight On** post is focused on a genre or theme, as you can see in the post title. Based on this genre/theme, you are welcome to share your views about dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post, which is:\n\n**Web Dramas**\n\nWeb dramas are short dramas that are usually initially distributed via web broadcast instead of traditional broadcast on a television channel. Web dramas are relatively speaking newcomers to the kdrama landscape though they have been steadily gaining increasing presence since 2015. The length of each episode varies, typically ranging from around 8 minutes up to 20 minutes long. Many web dramas are focused on school, college, and romance material. They are most often accessed through Youtube for international audiences though many streaming services also carry some of these dramas.\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "**Can You Deliver Time? 2002**\n\n**Good Things:**  Super short and sweet drama about a college-aged daughter who inadvertently travels back in time to before she was born and meets her parents before they got together.  Right away, the drama starts with a strong opening that sets the story and characters up in a compelling way.  The characters feel distinctive and well thought out, and the daughter in particular has a fun energy that is enjoyable to watch.  The drama is also well-written and paced well, and there is a minor twist that impacts the story in an interesting way.  The time travel takes place through an order placed on a unique delivery app, and feels like a fresh take on time travel.\n\n**Bad Things:**  The daughter does end up falling into the old noble idiocy trope, although not in a romantic way.\n\n**Interesting Things:**  This drama actually acknowledges Covid-19 and weaves it into the story, which is a bit rare for Kdramas.  In the present the daughter has to deal with the effects of Covid on society (masks, online classes, etc.), and when she travels to the past she experiences the freedom of life before quarantine.  &gt;!Additionally, Han So Eun, who plays the younger version of the mom in 18 Again, also plays the younger version of the mom in this drama.  Both 18 Again and Can You Deliver Time? 2002 also highlight the 2002 World Cup between Korea and Japan and use it as a plot point.!&lt;\n\n**Spotlight On Because:**  This drama has a unique take on time travel and is a fun, enjoyable ride in only two hours.  The ending is also heartwarming and well worth the journey, I definitely cried quite a bit!  If you love time-travel and stories that focus on finding family connections, if you like stories that are cute and touching, if you want to relive the past before Covid and apps on cell-phones, this is the drama for you!",

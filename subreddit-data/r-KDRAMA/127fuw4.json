            "comment": "Added four completed dramas this month, which means I\u2019ve doubled my completed challenges and am now at 8/36. Not too shabby. \n\n**Completed**\n\n* **Crash Course In Romance**- Challenge 16 (Jung Kyung Ho) - I loved it up until episode 12 then I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much. I felt like the writer needed to pare down the plot lines and be more focussed. It could have been a great drama, but ended up just being a good one. The actor\u2019s performances were excellent nonetheless. \n\n* **Doctor Stranger** - Challenge 24 -  I got back into the drama and finished it off but in the end I thought the villain was ridiculous, &gt;!rather than plot away for 20 years, he could have just ran for president properly!&lt;.\n\n* **Unlock My Boss** - Challenge 29 (recommended by u/LcLou02) - I expected it to be more fun than it was so I was a little disappointed. \n\n* **The Glory** - Challenge 22 (Revenge) - This was a good binge. I wasn\u2019t completely satisfied by the revenge but I did enjoy the twists and turns. \n\n**In Progress**\n\n* **Twenty Five Twenty One** (12/16) - Challenge #20 athlete main character - We took a couple of weeks off as we had visitors then I was away but restarted this week. I am still enjoying this rewatch. \n\n* **Our Blooming Youth** (14/20) - Challenge 21 (Disguise/False Identity) -  I\u2019m not up to date but although the drama is very slow paced it is quite enjoyable. \n\n* **Love Is For Suckers** (13/16) - Challenge TBD - I\u2019m looking forward to watching the last few episodes this weekend. This has been a pretty fun watch. \n\n**Up Next**\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m in the mood for, I\u2019ll probably pick something at random unless inspiration attacks. \n\n\n**Previously**\n\n[**January Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6lwj83/)\n\n**Dr. Park\u2019s Clinic** - #18 dream interpretation \n\n**Under The Queen\u2019s Umbrella** - #4 WoC Food: Kimchi - (episode 16) \n\n**Run On** - #6 WoC PPL; Sportswear \n\n[**February Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/11dyi35/comment/jabo12i/)\n\n**Kairos** - Challenge TBD",

Anyway you can see my full challenge list on [my MDL profile](https://mydramalist.com/profile/katherine197)\n\nIn March I have finished:\n\n* *#7 A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: Locations (Hospital):* **The Greatest Love**\n* *#16 A drama where one of the main cast shares your zodiac sign:* **Scent of a Women** \\- LDW is a Scorpio; I loved the travel agency setting and the second leads (both sml and sfl)\n* *#20 A drama with a main or supporting character that is an athlete:* **Crash Course In Romance**\n* *#23 A drama with at least one animal pet:* **100 Days My Prince** \\- light comedic sageuk (with sprinkle of angst), one of my favourites dramas this month, also possible for #8, #12, #18 or #21\n* *#25 A drama whose poster you liked at first sight:* **The Heavenly Idol** \\- I don't know what went wrong, but the only saving grace of this were Kim Min Gue's dimples\n* *#35 A drama that is at least 10 years old:* **Oh! My Lady**\n\nI\u2019m currently watching:\n\n* *#11 A drama starring an actor who has previously won the Baeksang best new actor or actress award:* **Damo** (2/14) - Ha Ji Won got this award in 2001;  Damo is an old historical and martial arts drama (from 2003), it has similar set up to 100 Days My Prince (&gt;!siblings of noble birth whose family fell, who are now separated and hiding!&lt;, could also be used for #21; I was also considering **King2Hearts** for this challenge, but I was feeling a segeuk more\n* *#22 A drama which features a character seeking revenge:* **Call It Love** (12/16)\n* *#30 A drama whose title is a direct translation of the Korean title:* **Delivery Man** (9/12) - wouldn't recommend it, i'm only gonna finish it because there are so few eps left\n\nI'm also watching **Apple Of My Eye** (4/120) which finishes airing in September so if I managed to finish it and if I'm not already done with the challenge by that time, I might use it for #36 (challenge from previous year: Long Form)\n\nIn April I'd like to watch **Queen For Seven Days** (#27), **The Heirs** (#3) or **Crazy Love** (#2); and I'm considering **Cinderella And the Four Knights** (#12). I would also like to watch something for #18 but I have already seen a lot/most of the things people recommended for it :(( so I'm choosing between **Pinocchio**, **Playful Kiss**, and **Hit the Top**.",

I would also highly recommend Hit the Top for #18 (though I haven't seen the others you're looking at).  Very fun lighthearted romp for the most part, similar in spirit to The Heavenly Idol but with a much better ending!",

            "comment": "2) **Trope Subversion**: *Love To Hate You*, a rare drama where it gets better with each episode. FL is the knight in shining armor for the ML. There's also unique spin on last episode sepeartion. FL's ex, instead of becoming a pininig hateful guy, he helps and becomes friends with her.\n\n\n\n4) **Food- Jajangmyeon**- *Puck*, 2 episode drama about ice hockey. They eat Jajanmyeon after practice. Lee Kwang Soo is in serious role. Man can act. Fits for challenge #20 too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15) **Multigen Cast**: *She Makes My Heart Flutter*, Follows an aunt and niece who happens to be lesbians and their separate love stories. Simple, well acted, and amazingly directed mini drama. A quote from it - \"True love is having 2 period tracker apps\".\n\n\n\n\n\n18) **Dream Interpretation**: *Scripting Your Destiny*, it'd be a spoiler if I mention how it fits here. Nevertheless, this is a short &amp; sweet drama (5hr long). Watch it if you want Goblin fix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32) **Single Episode**: *My Friend is Still Alive*, guy gets leukemia, has 6 months to live and wants to have 1st kiss b4 he dies. So his friends start hunting. That's the beginning. It becomes more as it goes. On [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tGj7b29zQk0).\n\n\n\n34) **&lt;500 on MDL**: *Employment War (2014)*, 26 watchers. a mocumentary style webdrama about 5 friends who are hell bent on getting a job. It is awkward comedy in the vein of The Office. Leaves you wanting for more. It's on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjYNvL189bCaNUiP2etCxvGj3u3NFwLQU).",

I am still making [lists](https://mydramalist.com/list/4Ko6PdX4) of possible challenges the dramas I watch can fit into. \nIn case you want to watch any of them and wonder if they fit your preferred challenge, to save you a click I have done **Alchemy of Souls, Kairos, Love to Hate You, Crazy Love, Unlock My Boss, Crash Course in Romance, Dr Parks Clinic, Black Knight: The Man who Guards Me**, and **On the Verge of Insanity**.\n\n**On the Verge of Insanity**:  About people getting laid off from a large company. Thankfully the people we followed were quite smart and resourceful, but it is of course a stressful subject. Big change in their life. I loved the writer's idea of the divorced couple. Nobody were completely good or bad. We mostly followed a man, even though the drama is written by a woman. Also there was a woman who was only there to take part in the sub-topic \"sexual harassment\". \nRecommended.     \nI checked if it fulfils these challenges: \n\n1. Heirs trope: Big brother worship, clingy jealous girl    \n2 subvert trope. I don't think so   \n4 forgot to check food    \n5 Tropes: None   \n6 PPL drink, household appliance, car. make up stick     \n7 No entries on Kdramaland      \n9 supporting actor Ahn Nae Sung        \n13 Kim Ga Un and Ahn Nae Sang have both been in Light in your eyes        \n15 No      \n17 they did talk about which school they went to, not sure if that is enough      \n18 no dream     \n19 minimal romance      \n20 no athlete     \n21 false identity no       \n22 revenge yes       \n23 pet no       \n28 was inspired by a review\n\n\n\n**Dr. Park\u2019s Clinic**\n\nFun. Cringe humour, but heart warming.   \n\nCh1  Heirs trope: No    \nCh 2 Subverts a trope - don't think so      \nCh 3 Not referenced     \nCh 4 Food: tteokbokki     \nCh 5 tropes No     \nCh 6 PPL Make-up, some drink, instant coffee, health supplement     \nCh  18 wasn't there a dream interpretation?     \nCh 19  No romance (married couple, though)    \n20 No athlete      \n21 I don't think a wig is good enough for disguise     \n22 No revenge    \n23 No pet      \n29  Suggested by Sianiam\n\n**Black Knight: The Man Who Guards Me**\nLots of people seems to have hated this drama, I quite liked it. Could have been better developed with better depth of characters and more philosophy.

I will probably just make it to twentyfour dramas that fit a challenge, possibly not even that. I am just going to skip the long challenge, the short challenge (probably).",

Also works for Jewelry PPL and a screenwriter whose works I have enjoyed before. Loved so many thigs about this drama!\n\n**Fanletter, Please!** \\- #2 Subverts a trope(\"It's so pretty!\" \"Yes, you are.\" is so memorably subverted here!) Also works for ,2% Nielsen rating for an episode.  Reminded me why I like Yoon Park...which brought me to :\n\n**Drama Special Season 9: The Tuna and the Dolphin** \\-  #20 an athlete. Cute, one episode drama.\n\n**Drama Special Season 8: If We Were a Season** \\- #32 One episode drama. sweet first-love story. Nice how they include all the seasons in just one hour!\n\n**Fated to Love You** \\- #5 Rich/Poor couple trope - Jang Hyuk and Jang NaRa are coming out with a new drama together in April (Family)  and I thought I'd better watch this first because surely they will included references! (How could they not!) Was also fun to see two of the other actors who played characters with Jang NaRa in The Last Empress in here, playing similar roles to what they would later have there. Also now I see that the idea of the 2 ducks that Jang NaRa took into her marriage with the Emperor also in this drama. (Maybe it is a common superstition that they will bring fertility?)\n\n**Black Knight: the Man Who Guards Me** \\- #6 Jewelry PPL Kind of a wacky melodrama with fantasy elements like people who live for centuries for a punishment, who have special powers and amazing wardrobes &amp; jewelry. Watching this and Fated to Love You made me realise that I really started watching Kdramas when 16 episodes has become the norm. Two of these 20 episode dramas in one month was a bit much. Extra hurdles put in the way of our couples...\n\nThanks to the 2 Drama Specials, this has tipped me over into the dedicated watcher challenge. (13/24)\n\n***Expectations for April***Will be finishing:**Taxi Driver Season 2** \\- #22 Revenge\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** \\- #21 false identities/disguises\n\n**Delivery Man** \\- #8 Lead was a child actor\n\n**Recipe for Farewell** \\- #25 A poster I liked - warm colours, cooking, cozy, and Kim Sabu!\n\nPlan to start:**Family** \\- waiting to see what challenges fits, but at least #13\n\n**Doctor Romantic Season 3** \\- #13 or #26, maybe more...\n\nWant to make a decision on my long format drama, so I can get it started.",

Too bad that had to stop in order to now get through the main murder arc. Leads would have been fine just becoming good friends and depending on each other with maybe a hint of other possibilities at the end (like 365: Repeat the Year or Sell Your Haunted House), but I guess a romance  is there to raise the stakes and create the dilemma of wanting to help her move on, yet not wanting her to leave.

Totally identified with the couple as I'm about the same age group. Usually in drama's the wife is critical, but this was actually so sweet. \n\n4. Food wheel: fried chicken - **Gaus Electronics**\n\n03/05/2023 Super funny, light-hearted and funny, really enjoyed it Aziz was doing the most. \n\n12. Drama with current kpop actor - **A Shoulder to Cry On**\n\n03/29/2023 So sweet, that is a BL done right. So soft, and no terrible cringe kiss. Flowers to the boys as well, outstanding debut in the acting world. With all the hype around it because of the OMEGA X drama, it is for sure outstanding top BL of 2023 so far. \\*could also use for athlete challenge . \n\n14. MAMA nominated artist Aliee (Goblin) - **Lovers of the Red Sky** \n\n03/11/2023 Loved this, absolutely my jam. I did think the ending dragged a tad, I'm not a huge fan of epilogues but this was awesome. \n\n20. One character is an athlete - **Revenge of Others**\n\n03/16/2023 It had a lot going for it, but the plot seemed to be too predictable. The ending was also sort of meh, would have liked a bigger twist. \n\n30.2 Direct translation - **Island** \n\n03/10/2023 Now finished officially, overall the production value, setting and cast are great, plot the line was too much for such a short run. Splitting it in half like that slowed down the story as well. \n\n31. drama with viewership rating of 2% of less on an episode - **Heavenly Idol** \n\n03/23/2023 I hope more people pick this up it was criminally underrated and so much fun. A great mix of comedy romance, and a little supernatural. Not your average rom-com I liked it. \\*could use for secret identity or trope suberversion\n\n**In Progress**\n\n**Our Blooming Spring** \\- for the secret identity,  really enjoying it but I'm preparing myself for a sad ending.\n\n**Taxi Driver 2** \\- for no romance, it's not quite on par with season 1 but it's still good. \n\n**Monster** 10/50 (long format) so I was going to do Empress Ki but I have picked this one up and it's somthing.....\n\n**The Secret Romantic Guesthouse** \\- picked this up for Kang Hoon, was looking for a Gemini actor and found out he and I share a birthday\n\n**Faith** \\- not sure where I'm going to slot it in yet. \n\n**Delivery Driver** \\- also not sure where to put this one yet.",

It would've been 8 if I had watched The Glory Part 1 this year, but I managed to finish it before New Years came. So, not happening.\n\nCompleted:\n\n* **Crash Course in Romance**: Challenge 26, a drama from a screenwriter or director who works I have previously enjoyed. Yang Hee Seung also wrote Weightlifting Fairy, which is one of my top dramas. Yoo Je Won also directed The King: Eternal Monarch, which I enjoyed.\n* **Record of Youth**: Challenge 30, a drama whose title is a direct translation of the Korean title. Didn't like this one too much, but I didn't hate it.\n* **Vincenzo**: Challenge 3, a drama that was referenced in another drama. Little Women has a Song Joong Ki cameo where his name tag was Park Joo Hyung, a reference to his Vincenzo character.\n* **Kill It**: Challenge 19, a drama with minimal or no romance. This one had no romance.\n* **At a Distance, Spring is Green**: Challenge 31, a drama with an episode which received less than 2% overall viewership rate from Nielsen. Episodes 5, 7, and 11 have less than 2%. The drama had low ratings in general, but they tended to linger around 2%.\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity**: Challenge 2, a drama which subverts a trope. Grim reaper is expected to be all powerful, but he is forced to be a servant to FL. There's also a scene where the ML was about to be caught lying because you expect he doesn't know how to perform a task (being a doctor). Turns out, he performs well because a whole surveillance team is feeding him information through an earpiece. There's probably more examples, but I checked out at one point.\n* **Love to Hate You**: Challenge 17, a drama where the college alma mater of a character was a plot point. FL's law school life is mentioned in relation to her ex-boyfriend, and it also plays a major role in the finale.\n\nIn-Progress:\n\n* **Our Blooming Youth (16/20)**: Challenge 21, a drama featuring a disguises or false identities. FL is pretending to be a eunuch.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (10/16)**: Challenge 36, a drama which fits a challenge from previous KDC years. It fits the 2022 challenge, a drama directed by a female or written by a male.\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (3/16)**: undecided, but I have put potential spots it can take. Once I finish, I'll put it in an appropriate slot.",

            "comment": "Accomplished 4 challenges this month! Including a drama that will likely be used for the long-form challenge!\n\n###Completed\n\n**Temptation of Wife** I can totally see why this drama is a seminal work in the genre of makjang dramas because the twists and characters are absolutely jaw-dropping at times. But what honestly surprised me is how much social commentary is packed into this drama. This drama really demonstrates how *context* is everything because so many of the characters say things that are often considered \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018wise\u2019 but become ludicrous in the context of what is happening in the drama and who is saying it. \n\n*Challenges:* 1 (Abusive Parents) | 3 | 5 (rich/poor couple) | 8 (Jang Seo Hee) | 15 | 21 | 22 | 24 | 26 (Kim Soon Ok) | **33** | 35\n\n**Dream High** (Rewatch) Loved the rewatch! Drama has held up well and while the acting from the kids is green all around, their energy is infectious. I think the drama handled the balance between youthful and adult idealism with harsh reality really well. The friendships felt genuine and heartwarming. If you like any of the cast members, I\u2019d say this is a good watch to see them in their beginning days of acting. They may not be as skilled as they are now but their youthful enthusiasm is still great to watch.\n\n*Challenges:* 2 (guy gets short haircut after heartbreak) | 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 12 (2PM) | 13 (IU &amp; Kim Soo Hyun) | **14 (IU)** | 35\n\n**Island** Was looking forward to this for the cast but ultimately walked away disappointed because the story was boring/predictable and pacing was off. I enjoyed the CGI bits for the most part so it\u2019s not even that the special effects were super disappointing, just the story felt too thin and plain. A case where the idea looks compelling but the drama was far from compelling. Still, this drama had some of the best posters and character posters I\u2019ve seen. \n\n*Challenges:* 6 (car | restaurant) | 11 (Kim Nam Gil) |\u00a0**25**\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** I absolutely loved this drama for the amount of philosophical musings it packed into this fun rom-com with a side of crime/thriller drama. (The bit about &gt;!assisted suicide/euthanasia!&lt; in the final episodes made me bawl.) Aside from the brilliant dialogue that is filled with references and word play, what I liked best about the drama is how it subverted certain tropes in ways that became crucial to its overall message. Unfortunately, I do think that appreciation of this drama relies heavily on contextual cultural knowledge, especially familiarity with a large selection of drama tropes and past dramas. Add to the thoughtful writing gorgeous camerawork and beautiful OST along with memorable acting, this drama has definitely won my heart. For me, easily a contender for one of the best dramas this year.  \n\n*Challenges:* 2 (FL piggybacks ML, ML does not touch sleeping FL\u2019s face) | 4 (kimchi, ice cream, fried chicken) | 5 (childhood connection) | **17** | 26 (writers) | 31\n\n###Currently Watching\n\n**Delivery Man** (10/12) Loving this drama for its mix of heartfelt earnestness and heartbreaking mini-arcs. The comedy is fun, the romance cute, and the ghosts not that scary. It\u2019s nothing groundbreaking but such an easy watch that moves my heart each week.\n\n*Challenges:* 8 (Yoon Chan Young) | 26 (Show Window\u2019s Director/Writer)\n\n###Previously\n\n[**MDL Challenge List**](https://mydramalist.com/list/LOP9gBP3)\n\n[**January**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6pls6h/)\n\n**20th Century Boy and Girl** (Rewatch)  1 (Childhood Friends; Drowning My Sorrows) | 4 (**Tteokbokki**, also Fried Chicken, Jajangmyeon, Kimchi, Hoe, Jeon) | 9 (Kim Mi Kyung &amp; Kim Chang Wan) | 30 | 31\n\n[**February**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/11dyi35/comment/jadkais/)\n\n**Decoy/Bait S1** 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 9 | 13 (Heo Sung Tae &amp; Yoo Sung Joo) | 19 | 26\n\n**KAIROS** (Rewatch) 1 (Run away holding hands, wrist grab) | 4 (Fried Chicken, Samgak Gimbap) | 5 (Childhood Connection) | 6 (car) | 7 (Hotel) | 8 &amp; 11 (Lee Se Young)\n\n**M** 2 (woman put handkerchief down for man to sit in Ep 3) | 5 (amnesia) |\u00a0**34**\u00a0(I'm 35th completed watcher) | 35",

Powered through to the end.\n* **Crash Course in Romance** (screenwriter whose work I've enjoyed). Sigh... my hopes were so high and it started out so excellent. Still loved all the characters and the family and friendship, but disappointed. Don't have your expectations too high going into a show, kids.\n* **Another Miss Oh** (dream interpretation). I thought I was going to be fudging this category a bit with premonitions, but then BAM &gt;!conception dream!&lt;. Success!\n* **Political Fever / Going to the Blue House Like This** (main or supporting character who's an athlete). Absolute madness, I had a great time.\n* **One Dollar Lawyer** (poster I liked at first sight). WILD tone shifts. The first four episodes were a 10/10 for me, and then the turns threw me for a loop. One of the few times I'll say a show should have been longer?? I think that a full 16 episodes maybe would have let the story breathe a bit more. Still had fun!\n\nIn progress:\n\n* **Angry Mom** (featuring disguises or false identities). It is truly shocking how well Kim Hee Sun sells this. Ok, I might not believe her as 19, but I'd totally buy 25.\n* **Live** (well-known supporting actor). Calling it now, this will be the show I finish on December 28th.\n* **Military Prosecutor Doberman** (title is direct translation of the Korean). I had no idea what to expect. Probably the best way to go into this show.\n* **Our Blooming Youth** (character seeking revenge). This one is not quite working for me and I don't know why, because I do like the characters and I love the friendship between the two main women. It's just... the story feels slow and disconnected?",

I really enjoyed the interactions the characters had with each other.\n\n**Breakup Probation: A week** - This really surprised me because Yuri is such a so-so actress but she really delivered in this. Great performance. \n\n**Crash course in Romance** - This was a really hard start for me. And i have no clue why. I opened this on Netflix about twenty times before I actually watched the first episode but when I finally did I really got into it. My favourite part was that there were no annoying exs. Great writing. \n\n**Kokdu: season of deity** - this was just awful. I don't know how I made it to the end. \n\n**Heavenly idol** - went in with little expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I liked it. \n\n**The fabulous** - Choi Minho hasn't lead a drama in such a long time and I was excited to see this. But it ended up being a 'meh' for me. I didn't think he had any real chemistry Chae Soobin. She often gives off 'damsel in distress and needs a white knight' vibes. But this drama was more capable career woman style. So Minho was never there to save her but be her partner and that dynamic didn't work out imo. But I did love Joseph. \n\n\n**Currently Watching**\n\nPandora \n\nTaxi driver 2 \n\nThe real has come \n\n\nSo, I have not filled in any challenge numbers. I'm just watching dramas now, and I'll figure out where they will fit later. Since I'm not doing chaebol again, I should have enough to fill any level, I think. \n\nWe'll see how it goes.",

This was a rewatch for me, but I enjoyed it just as much the second time around!\n\n**#26 A drama from a screenwriter** **~~or director~~** **you previously enjoyed -** ***The Glory***. I was able to watch this one going straight from part 1 to part 2, and it didn't quite measure up to the hype for me (no particular complaints, just wasn't totally for me I think), but I'm still glad I finally watched it! It was interesting to see how things that I consider typical KES drama tropes did or didn't appear in this one.\n\n**#35** **10+ years old** \\- ***School 2013***. This was my second shot at trying to watch this drama, but once I got into it I really liked it! Recommend if you're in the mood for teen angst with lots of bromance, also surprisingly relatable if you've ever worked in a school (even outside of South Korea) imho.\n\n**Currently Watching:**\n\n**#3 Drama referenced in another drama** \\- ***The Legend of the Blue Sea*** **(3/20**). There's a super passing reference to this in episode 3 of Be Melodramatic! (Btw, Melo is an absolute goldmine of references to other dramas, if people are struggling with this challenge lol.)\n\n\\#**33 Long-form drama** \\- ***Once Again*** **(38/100).** Drawing closer to the halfway mark of this one!\n\nLots of dramas that I'm interested in coming out mid-April! I'm excited to see which challenges they can fit. :D",

The first show I actually completed for the challenge that I didn't like.  I respect its creative intentions and Cho Seung Woo gave a good performance but so much of it was crushingly dull.  \n\n**The Glory pt. 2** (8/10): Category #22:  A drama which features a character seeking revenge.\n\n**My Love from the Star** (7.5/10): Category #24:  A drama you always wanted to watch but for some reason have not watched yet.\n\n**The World of the Married** (10/10): Category #3:  A drama that was referenced in another drama.  I can't praise this show highly enough, it was incredible.    \n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (6/10): Category #31:  A drama with an episode which received less than 2% overall viewership rate from Nielsen.  The leads were great, the writing failed them in the second half.  \n\nLater today I'm also going to be finishing **The Devil Judge** for Category #36: A drama which fits a challenge from previous KDC years.  This fits challenge #29 from the 2022 challenge:  A drama that takes place in a fictional city, country, or world.  I'm not done yet but so far I love this show, I'd put it at a 9/10.",

Zodiac sign - **All The Liquors** \\- this was pretty entertaining except for the fish kiss\n\n28. Comment from r/kdramarecommends \\- **Woofy Poofy Love** \\- this was so cute, I wish it was 12 episodes. Got it from this [epic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/comments/fnaqrv/compilation_of_webdramas_that_i_would_recommend/). \n\nAlso watched **Don't Lie Rahee** thinking it would fit challenge 20 a character that is an athlete. The [poster](https://mydramalist.com/718667-don-t-lie-rahee) has the characters on a basketball court in athletic clothes but there was no athletics, just jogging for exercise. So I think I need another one for challenge 20. \n\nFinished the second part of **Glory** too. That felt like a continuation and not a second season. I think it counts as one drama.",

            "comment": "I completed five challenges this month, bringing my total to 12 completed challenges!  \n\n**Completed:**  \n\nChallenge 1 - One or More Heirs Tropes: **Crash Course In Romance** \u2013 Shares many tropes with the Heirs, including &gt;!Abusive Parents, Drowning My Sorrows, Driven to Suicide, Disappeared Dad, Hot Teacher, If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her, Inter-Class Romance, Missing Mom, Nice Girl, Private Tutor, The Parent-Produced Project, and Will They or Won't They.!&lt;  I absolutely loved this show for most of its run, but it really fell apart for me at the end, sadly.  \n\nChallenge 9 - Starring a Well-Known Supporting Actor: **The Heavenly Idol** \u2013 Both lead actors have five or more supporting actor credits on MDL.  Loved the first half, found the second half frustrating.  The world building ended up being very confusing and nonsensical, and by the end all the fun was lost for me.  \n\nChallenge 14 - Drama With an OST by an Artist Who Has Been Nominated for or Won an MAMA Award: **Be Melodramatic** \u2013 I enjoyed this one a lot!  It lagged a bit in the middle, but made up for it with a good ending.  Loved the over the top PPL and meta commentary, I get the sense the actors and writers involved had a lot of fun with it.  \n\nChallenge 19 - Drama With Minimal or No Romance: **Hellbound** \u2013 I generally tend not to watch dramas with a lot of violence, so I avoided this one for a long time.  The premise was so interesting to me though, and I am so glad that I decided to watch it now!  It wasn't as graphic as I expected, the focus centers more on the ideas and viewpoints of various characters with some well-placed violence for emphasis.  Without getting into spoiler territory, I found it fascinating that some themes on the show were similar to some themes I've read about relating to chronic conditions/illness.  The acting and writing were both very compelling, would definitely recommend!  \n\nChallenge 22 - Drama Which Features Character Seeking Revenge: **The Glory** \u2013 So I wasn't planning on watching this one because I generally don't love watching bullying or revenge storylines, but then I happened to see a couple clips on YouTube and got sucked in!  I ended up enjoying it more than I expected to, though the bullying was very hard to watch.  I read that the actress playing the young version of the main bully (Shin Ye Eun) actually had people unfollow her because they didn't want to see her smile anymore!  \n\n**In Progress:**  \n\n**Father Is Strange 46/52** \u2013 Almost to the end of this one!  It's been a really nice ride overall, though I don't love the prominent storylines at this point in the drama.  I will finish it leisurely, hopefully by the end of next month.  \n\n**Our Blues 15/20** \u2013 Such a wonderful drama to relax with!  This drama has truly touched me, I especially loved the storyline with the old friends reconnecting.  Looking forward to seeing how it all wraps up.  \n\n**Switch: Change the World 8/16** \u2013  So far this has been a very fun drama!  Lots of twists and turns and funny moments.  Not sure if it will change tone in the second half, I'll have to wait and see.",

I def recommend this. \n\n**Kokdu Season of the Deity** \\- *#17 alma mater a plot point*: In the beginning the FL has a hard time finding a job due to her alma mater not being impressive.

Some going points ML's acting was great, I loved the brother, and I did like &gt;!that Kokdu didn't become human!&lt; in the end. \n\n**Island** \\- *#30 direct translation*: This drama should not have been split.

It looked pretty and the fight scenes looked cool. \n\n**Currently Watching:** \n\n**Our Blooming Youth -** I am enjoying this show. I know its a little light on the actual romance, but I am still enjoying it.

Will put this in #8 child actor, #7 Hospital Location, #31 ep with rating less than 2%\n\n**Call it Love -** I am loving this show! But I am going to be so sad if we get a sad ending...which I think will happen. #4 Food sundae eaten in the first episode, #22 seeking revenge, #25 poster I liked, #20 FL used to be an athlete\n\n**The Real Has Come -** This is a weekend drama that just started, so far liking it. Lets see if it sticks. Prob for #18 dream interpretation or #33 long form drama \n\n**Starting in April:** Bora!

I'm so glad I decided to watch this one for my long form drama.\n\n**Ongoing:**\n\n**King 2 Hearts** \\- 6/20 (Challenge #26 A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed). \n\nI had issues with one ep that just kept freezing on me, so I stopped half way through the ep. I keep meaning to watch the other half but... I keep putting it off. Literally the only thing that makes me want to keep watching is Lee Seunggi.  \n\n**The Heavenly Idol** \\- 4/12  (Challenge #31 A drama with an episode which received less than 2% overall viewership rate from Nielsen) \n\nI started this last week, and am loving it so far. It's definitely more entertaining that I expected. I was tempted to binge watch it, but am making myself watch it slowly.\n\n\r\r**Our Blooming Youth** \\- 14/20 (Challenge #21 A drama featuring disguises or false identities)\n\nI absolutely love this. I put it on hold so I can binge the final few eps. I have been enjoying every ep so far... and I kinda did want to keep watching it while it aired. But I have trust issues with saegeuk drama endings.\n\nI have a whole bunch of on air dramas I want to start watching, but I'll probably try to watch a few completed dramas first. I am also debating which old drama to watch... kinda tempted to rewatch City Hunter or Arang and the magistrate. Will probably start Taxi Driver soon as well, although not sure if I can fit it into one of the themes.",

            "comment": "I'm half way done 18/36. March was quite productive because several shows were ongoing and ended in March. \n\n**#9 Supporting actor. Crash Course in Romance.** It had almost all the famous supporting actresses, but I'll go with Kim My Kyung cameo as NHS's mother. I loved the show at the beginning and then it kind of got lost with the stalker/murderer plot and the bio-mom, but overall it was a solid show because of the main leads and the high-schoolers.\n\n**#13 Costars multiple times. Love to Hate You.** Teo Yoo and Kim Ok-bin were also in Arthdal Chronicles though never together there. This was a fun show with a very strong female lead.\n\n**#17 Alma mater as a plot point. The Secret Life of My Secretary.** A lot of the motivation of the FL was getting the sister into U Penn and paying for the tuition. Literally watched this to see Kim Young-kwang smile as we get through the angst of Call It Love. It was very cute.\n\n**#26 Screenwriter/PD I like. The Glory 1 and 2.** I love Kim Eun-sook and can't stand Soing Hye-kyo, but the comments on the subreddit were so good, that I gave it a try. I waited for the second half to drop to watch the first half. I wasn't disappointed. This is really an incredible drama thanks to a very tight and well-written script and excellent performances. My sister has been making fun of me for watching K-dramas and this was her gateway show.\n\n**#30 Direct translation. Island 1 and 2.** Not sure if this counts since the title is actually the pronunciation of Island in Korean characters. This was a bit of a mess that strong performances could not really save, but it had an interesting mythology.\n\n**#31 Less than 2% rating. The Heavenly Idol.** Loved Kim Min-kyu, but the script was definitely lacking. I still thought it was enough fun to watch until the end. Differently from Kokdu which was such as mess it became unbearable.\n\n**#33 Long form. Empress Ki (rewatch).** The first time I watched this, it hit me like a freight train. I think I went through the 51 episodes in less than a week. There is so much packed into every episode that subsets of 10-15 episodes would make a regular drama and it covers more than 10 years of history in a mostly fictionalized retelling of real events. This time, I took it slow over more than a month with a couple of episodes a day. It is so good and heartbreaking! I knew how it was going to end and I was still gutted, but I will still watch it again.\n\nNow, I have lots of difficult challenges left and not very excited about most of the current ongoing or opening dramas. I'm only watching Call It Love and Our Blooming Youth. Waiting for Black Knight in May and the end of Oasis since comments have been mixed and I'll wait for the end to decide whether I want to watch it.\n\nI've already done the recommendation challenge (#28), but I also watched **Our Dating Sim** because of the comments in the posts. It was my first BL and with just 8 15 min episodes it's more like a movie. The lead couple of utterly adorable.",

Qualifies for challenges 2, 9, 15, 20, 21, and 26.\n* **Fanletter, Please** \\- Heartwarming story. Short enough to be fully enjoyable and not rushed. All of the relationships are wholesome: dad and daughter, dad and FL, daughter and celebrity, the kids in the hospital, the \"uncle\" and family. I loved how Choi Soo Young played her character.

So far I think it has some more interesting ideas than **Once Again** (which I watched for last year's challenge), but I am not enjoying MFIS as much as Once Again. Especially in this one the \"evil mother in law\" character is so extreme I cannot give her any sympathy. Also, I had a hard time accepting Kim Hae Sook as a nice kdrama mom after seeing her be so evil in **Under the Queen's Umbrella**. It seriously took me 20 episodes to get past my prejudice against Queen Dowager Cho.\n* **Fated to Love You** (15/20)- This was my first kdrama so it has a very special 10/10 spot on MDL and in my heart. I probably watched it 5 times before branching out and trying any other kdramas, and in total I think this is my 7th or 8th rewatch. I decided to rewatch it this year before [Family](https://mydramalist.com/730561-family) premiers in April (reuniting Jang NaRa and Jang Hyuk again). I moved up my watch date a little bit because I can't stand Song Ok Sook's character in **My Father is Strange** and needed to remember how much I love her as Mi Young's mom.",

Mostly I have been choosing dramas, then figuring out how to slot them into the challenge prompts, but that will be more difficult moving forward. I generally like romance but I like to vary the genre, and the age group of the leads. I watched the **Heirs** &amp; **BOF** back to back &amp; it was far too much in terms of similar plots / storylines. I was also watching a few currently airing shows that finished in March/April so I'm in a weird moment where I am not watching anything ... maybe I'll start **Bo Ra! Deborah** so my week has some structure :p   \nLooking for recommendations on Challenge #33 a long form drama - I feel like this will be the more difficult &amp; should tackle it soon.",

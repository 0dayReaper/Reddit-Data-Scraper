Neither one of them really had to reckon with their bad behaviour or make any apologies or amends for the harm they caused. I can still kind of get on board with a Sua redemption arc coz she\u2019s a kid with a terrible parent and mental illness, but honestly she didn\u2019t even really do much to redeem herself other than hand Haeyi some notes as if that just makes up for everything. She should\u2019ve had to drop out of school like Sunjae and get proper therapy, not become the poster child of The Pride after all the nasty stunts she pulled. And even so, there\u2019s no way she deserves to end up with Geonhu; like my girl Danji was right there and had a lil crush on him all along. \n\nBut the fact that her mom gets a whole ass job in the academy and continues to play a role that keeps her around these kids and their parents rubs me so wrong. She is a bad influence, has bad instincts, and has no ethics. And her calling Sunjae\u2019s mom pretending to be friends with her was just cringe. \n\nThe lawyer mom\u2019s reconciliation with her family, on the other hand, felt a lot more wholesome and well deserved.",

Those were not offences she should have to drop out of school for.\n\nShe did have some violent fantasies, true, but they were only in her imagination.  She never acted on them.  When she exploded at her mother \"It could have been me\" is when she realized that Hae-e was just like her, subject to the same pressures and she felt bad for hating her.  She wished her harm and harm ended up happening.  That is always a sobering moment.  This is why she did a 180 and kept notes for her.  Something even her best friends didn't think of doing.  So yeah, she earned her redemption, especially since it was not a big deal.",

But they were all in part victims of a bad system. While my impulsive brain needed them to get comeuppance and be shunned by all, I do appreciate the idea that rehabilitation is possible, and that seemingly bad people can learn / change and start putting good out into the world. One of the things I loved and admired most about Haeyi was that she was a totally unbothered queen when it came to Sua \u2014 she didn\u2019t let Sua\u2019s ugliness bring her down even if I wanted to rip out her hair sometimes \ud83d\ude05\n\nI do agree that the timing / short amount of screen time given to this rehabilitation process makes the outcomes look unsatisfying though!",

The romance.  How CCY heard that she wanted to study and fell head over heels again.  He's got himself a woman of substance.   The walk.  The conversavation in the car.

And the fact that they both wore both rings throughout their engagement.  !&lt;Heart fluttering. \n* The way CCY &gt;!celebrated with his students that she passed tells alot about him as a teacher. And you know those student understand that he gets how stressful the exams are. !&lt;\n* NHS in &gt;!study mode was ADORABLE.  I loved that casual grey sweater.

The healing trip with her and her son.  Moving to a less pressure law firm.  Talking about how Sun Jae doesn't want to be a lawyer.  I'm glad that she and HaeJi were able to work things out and become close again. !&lt; I'm hoping he gets to be a vet in the spinoff in my head post-army.\n* &gt;!SunJae and HaeE ship has sailed! And in the cutest way.!&lt;  I love that the entire group stayed close&gt;!.  That SunJae and GH are clearly best friends.  And the dorky way he jumped around and took her hand.  Adorable.  I'm glad they had a space of a few years.  Getting together in high school would not have worked out!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real love story is NHS and HaeE.

I also found it refreshing how the writer inserted a love-triangle between Hae-Yi, Sun-Jae, and Geon-Hu without making it overly dramatic and cliche. (Oh, and a special shoutout to Geon-Hu for being the scene-stealer in this drama and quite possibly, my favorite male high school character on par with 2521's Moon Ji-Woong\\~!)\n\nLastly, while the thriller plot-line was a bit choppy at times and the resolution with Mr. Ji was a bit anti-climatic, after watching today's finale, I think I'm okay with overlooking some of those weak spots, because of the overall strengths of the drama.",

He brings absolutely no preconceptions to everyone he meets.\n\nAnd here's Chi-yeol's character development: &gt;!he's happy to eat dinner without any issues with old friends he fell out of contact with, hamming it up like crazy while he's at it, and talks normally with his new assistant (who is, incidentally, adorable and hopefully not a serial killer). He's finally functioning as a happy adult man.!&lt; \ud83e\udd70 All Haeng-seon's doing!\n\nI'm *really* happy the ending brought about some clear-eyed closure for some of the families, and especially for &gt;!Hui-jae!&lt;.\n\n&gt;!I did wonder if there might be a decent person under Su-a's mother-inflicted issues, since she was such a mini-me and so much of the show has been about not being like your parents... I'm glad I was ultimately right. That girl really needed friends and I'm so glad she has them now, and I can't think of any better influences.!&lt; And, as ever, I love Hae-e and Dan-ji's friendship! Although I'm starting to think Dan-ji's mother will never *quite* be able to communicate like a normal person. I think she means well, but it still comes across as bitchy. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAfter that letter from Haeng-ja, I'd check anyway... but it did seem finally heartfelt. Hae-e's plan worked!\n\nKeep digging, Jae-woo... And Yeong-ju's laugh... \ud83e\udd23\n\n&gt;!\"From what Haeng-seon told me, you have a knack for drawing lines. So I wonder why you drew it so curvy this time.\"!&lt; \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 And all the faces peering through the window in the background! That whole scene made me laugh so hard!

Fantastic. \n\n-The flashback when NHS picked up Haeyi was so sweet! I started tearing up a little. And the casting of the little girl was perfect, she looks so similar to Roh Yoon seo. \n\nWhat I liked:\n\n-I actually liked how Sua\u2019s mom and Sunjae\u2019s mom ended up! Very fitting for Sua\u2019s mom. And I\u2019m glad Sunjae\u2019s mom now has a good relationship with Huijae.\n\n-Geon Hu is so charming!!!! I\u2019m really hoping he\u2019s cast as a lead soon. He and Sua would make a good couple, I think. He\u2019d chill her out and she\u2019d give him a little more structure.\n\n-I love how we saw a glimpse of the four young ones in college! So glad they\u2019re all still friends. \n\n-Haeyi and Sunjae, FINALLY! Sunjae\u2019s excitement was so cute \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\n\n-I was so uncomfortable watching the \u201ctalented\u201d part. That was a tough scene to watch",

            "comment": "That was one of my favourite drama finales ever. :')\n\nI just want to talk about a couple of things I think are notable. Not too spoilery, but I'm going to hide them just in case.\n\n&gt;!Firstly, I'm so glad that once Haeng-seon and Chi-yeol got together that they didn't break up. I didn't think they would, based on the trajectory of their relationship thus far, but I wondered if the writer would feel the need to break them up or temporarily separate them, and she didn't! Instead we got an amazing double proposal and I loved the rest of their scenes too. Their relationship is such a treasure. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Secondly, I think the brief discord between Haeng-seon and Hae-yi took the place of the traditional main couple breakup we would typically get. Their bond was central from the beginning and stayed that way until the end. It was so lovely. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!What occurred to me, though, is that I think this drama successfully subverted a common drama viewer complaint. Often, dramas begin with the FL front and center, but gradually - and especially at the end - the ML takes precedence. I don't think this is true of every drama (and it's subjective, of course) but I do think it's true of some. I don't think this drama did that. The subplot with Chi-yeol and Mr. Ji had its time in the spotlight, but the final real conflict in the drama was the potential of Hae-yi leaving Haeng-seon. Ultimately, despite the time spent on the murder subplot, I never felt like Haeng-seon (or any of the other female characters) were shortchanged. I like that a lot.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Wow, these 8 weeks went by so fast! It has been such a joy watching the show and then coming on here to discuss it with you all. In the beginning, I would even rewatch the episodes during the week because they were such a source of happiness. I also tried my best to read the threads regularly. It's so special to watch an on air show with this community \u263a\ufe0f\n\nOthers are commenting so well on the ups and downs of the show, so I don't have much too add that's different. I really do wish the warm fuzzy feels that were present in the beginning and very end, were also maintained in the middle. But shifting my view from \"Crash Course in Romance\" to \"One Hit Scandal\" really helped.\n\nI appreciated the ways the team worked hard to tie up some of the plot lines. Unfortunately some felt superficial in the end and didn't do it for me. But I appreciate their effort. And there were still so many parts of the show that were a delight and ended well. Overall, it was a good show. But perhaps not the top 5 I was initially thinking it would get.\n\nOn a personal note, I've been struggling really hard with a career exam of mine and it's been a grueling multi-year process. I didn't expect this show to really hit home for me, but NHS' dedication was really inspiring. I love how she didn't give up and was so confident. I feel motivated to try to emulate her mindset. I will also mimic CCY's scream of joy when I finally pass \ud83d\ude05 Fighting to anyone who reads this and may also be struggling with exams and their career! \ud83e\udd73",

She's angry at her biological mother, and then when the mother leaves, she's back to her old self suddenly.\n\nHyo-won, best girl in episode.\n\nThank god they finally fixed Haeng-seon's bangs.

            "comment": "I have to say this is one of my favorite couplings ever in Kdrama. Emotionally mature, off the charts chemistry and the writing was just perfection between our leads. In addition, the \u201cfound family\u201d feel of this kdrama was wonderful and I felt like the cast was strong and solid. Loved it.\n\nThat being said, I would still rate this a 8/10. Our main leads and the relationship between the FL and her \u201cdaughter\u201d were the best written and strongest points. This resulted in all the weak points standing out way more than they usually would in a kdrama.\n\nMy main gripe with this kdrama is that it produces traumatizing results with no room to explore the consequence. Such as &gt;!MR Ji committing suicide in front of the ML, Hae-yi being kidnapped and in a coma then being ABANDONED again by her bio-mom, etc.!&lt; Bio-moms entire arc was ultimate pointless, and served no purpose. The characters did not grow from it. They did not learn from it. Even the indication that her mom is still \u201cin touch\u201d feels unearned since the only reason she showed up was &gt;!for money, and then she felt only slightly guilty before abandoning her daughter all over again, of which we get no actual closure on.!&lt; I would have much rather a storyline in which she finds out her mother has passed or her mother before leaving actually TELLS her daughter she is too selfish to care for her and that she\u2019s sorry for abandoning her but she can\u2019t stay. Anything besides what we got would have been more impactful. \n\nBasically I feel like the aftermath of what should be very traumatizing and serious situations were rushed because they weren\u2019t given the proper pacing to begin with and were clearly not well thought out with the rest of the drama. \n\nANYWAY\n\nThe other thing is that I don\u2019t believe all these characters deserved a \u201chappy ending\u201d. Su-a and her mom have their stories tied up very strangely. After suffering so much Su-a is just\u2026 ok? She even says she won\u2019t get to study the things she actually likes due to Med School. Even her mom hasn\u2019t changed. Literally there is no repercussions to her moms behavior or Su-a\u2019s &gt;!violent and/or suicidal tendencies!&lt;. She\u2019s just suddenly better and is now dating our &gt;!golden retriever boy!&lt;. It\u2019s a very weird ending.\n\nNow compared to Su-Jae\u2019s ending with his mom and family which I adored. The &gt;!fallout from her decisions was finally the wake up call that she needed to realize what she was doing to her children and herself. I love that she came to realize the damage she did and is trying to make amends by spending time with her kids and letting them live their lives and supporting them. I can believe in this change of heart simply because of how bad things finally got. Sometimes rock bottom is necessary and I\u2019m glad we see that things are not all peachy for her - she has to rebuild her career but this time, she\u2019s not doing anything at the expense of the people she loves. I appreciate this.!&lt;\n\nOne thing I absolutely loved was Haeyi running to the FL and yelling out \u201cMom!\u201d With that flashback. Immediate waterfall of tears from me. Beautifully done. \n\nAnd our leads. Ugh. I love them. The way they display their love in public after half the show trying to hide it to protect others around them and then finally just getting to be completely free with each other. The support. The way they look at each other. It\u2019s everything.\n\nSo yeah, 8/10 for me but could\u2019ve been a 9/10 or even 10/10 with some major adjustments. But this is one drama I WILL be recommending and I truly hope this writer along with other writers bring us more adult-type romances like this because wow, it was a breath of fresh air and so needed. \n\nI will miss this cast and drama but so happy I lived to experience it.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I completely forgot but another highlight was Haeyi and Sunjae!! That made me so happy to see. &gt;!They definitely belong together and I\u2019m glad we got positive closure on that because UGH the butterflies. I\u2019d love to see these two starring in their own romcom because they have great chemistry.!&lt;",

The only character that had a eureka moment was mean lawyer mom.  I don\u2019t care for her redemption either way but I was happy for it for the sake of her eldest son who REALLY deserves a good life and better mom. I am so happy she\u2019s being that for him now!  He\u2019s so sweet. \n\nI hated the su a stuff. It was TOO much meanness to then go from that to getting the cute puppy lol  I just felt if we needed to see she changed and was more kind to hae e that was enough. No more needed of her \n\n\nAnd agree the bio mom drama was filler and has HUGE gaps. What you said would work way more. I maintain it should have been 14 eps or so and showed more of main couple and less hamfisted faux redemption \n\nI do love CCY\u2019s new assistant bjt. That was so cute.\n\nEdit to add: the Main couple was so mature and kind and with great communication and I wanted more of their scenes of life and dealing with family together. Love them! Love his being tossed into a big family and embracing them all so fast. The best part for me since day one. \n\nAlso. Did not need a pregnancy element. Really hate how so many endings feel they must add the idea of a baby somewhere. I\u2019m at least glad it wasn\u2019t the leads tho !",

Her proposing first followed by CCY getting flustered and saying so was very reminiscent of HTCCC hahaha. The double rings is so cute, I totally wanna do that if I ever settle down in the future!&lt;\n\nCCY celebrating with his class after NHS told him she passed was so wholesome! Love that they decided to show that scene cause it just goes to show how CCY is more than just a teacher to the students there. Love that he still meets Jongryeol and OMG they did the unlock phone by  forcing his eyes open thing again HAHAHAHA\n\nNHS &gt;!picking up Haeyi from school after her CSATs wrecked me especially with the flashback from the past. Love this mother-daugher duo so much, I'm gonna miss them :( Only thing I don't like is that they keep enabling each others self-sacrificing tendencies. Goddamn, the whole 'I'm gonna move to Japan' from Haeyi and 'I'm gonna respect her wishes and let her go' from NHS was killing me. Thank goodness the bio mum left on her own.!&lt;\n\nAll the toxic mums + Sua seemed to kinda get their act straight after dealing with their own set of trauma so yey to character development (esp for Sunjae's mum and her rs with Huijae) But I gotta say, Sua's nice era seems very underdeveloped but ig it's mainly from the lack of screentime she was getting over the past few episodes. Would've been great if they focused on her character development over the past few episodes instead of the whole 'the words are dancing around'\n\nThe show was great in bringing up the flaws of the system: high stress, people resorting to unhealthy means to study (adderall), how banding students helps them learn at their own pace but also creates more stress cause of rankings and trying to make it into better bands. Wish they showed changes being made to improve that but Ig the reality is that we bring up flaws of the education system all the time but we're slow to bring about change :/  &gt;!Kudos to them showing CCY teaching classes to weaker students at the end though!!&lt;\n\nOverall, I loved the show loads, and I'm going to miss looking forward to my weekends for my comfort show. Some episodes felt out of place (murder mystery plot was not it) but even then, the show never failed to bring me joy and I'm grateful for that. Can't wait to see the cast in their future shows and YEY to Nam Haeyi appearing in Running man next week! Can't wait!!",

The second time I watched it I really noticed how good the ML and how expressive his face is. Love him! I will miss CCIR too but episode 15 missed the mark (for me) with the sudden romance between the uncle and best friend and the death of Mr  Ji. Plus bio mom is just too awful.",

I know &gt;!time skips!&lt; are controversial, but I thought it worked well here.\n\nI loved all the CCY and NHS moments:\n  - They &gt;!proposed to each other!!&lt; Perfection, so beautiful, so sweet. I was worried there was going to be a last minute break up.\n  - Their banter in the car when CCY picked up NHS from the study cafe and asked her if she wanted to go to his place.\n  - CCY\u2019s excitement when &gt;!NHS finally passed her exam.!&lt;\n- &gt;!That final scene as they kissed in the street.!&lt;\n\nOther favorite moments\n - The callback moment when &gt;!NHS went to pick up Haeyi after her CSAT exam.!&lt;\n- Sunjae\u2019s family &gt;!reunited and around the dinner table. I was happy that his mom seemed to finally realize what\u2019s important.!&lt;\n- CCY\u2019s friendship with the other teacher, that &gt;!whole drinking scene!&lt;\n- CCY back in his element, excited and happy to be teaching.\n- The foursome still together &gt;!in college.!&lt;\n\nThe show wasn\u2019t perfect in every episode, but it was wonderful for most of it and had so many beautiful, heartwarming, funny moments. This is now one of my favorites. I will miss it so much.\n\nThank you so much to the amazing cast.\n\nThis was my first on air watch, and while it was a long wait after every episode, it was the highlight of my week and a bright ray of sunshine.\n\nIt was fun to watch along with everyone here. Thanks all for your comments, analysis, speculations - I\u2019m amazed how many plot points you all guessed right.",

A young playa\n\nAnd bio mom finally being decent\nAnd Hae-yi &gt;!and her boy.!&lt;\n\nThe whole class cheering with Mr Choi (after he pretended to be cool on the phone)\n\nHonestly there are so many lines in this episode that are classic. \n\nThe sister &gt;!swearing she didn't steal any jewelry or money!&lt;  was beyond funny \ud83d\ude03\n&gt;!So happy she is somewhat in touch!&lt;\n\nThe relationship here once it got going was fantastic.

Being able to cover such serious real world issues and plots with humour and romance that was pretty solid and supportive and sensual was a feat. Aside from the first misunderstanding about marital status... No games. I didn't realise how much I needed that older couple vibe. \n\nSeveral EDITs.\nI'm done!",

It was still a good enough ending since everyone had their happy ending nonetheless.",

I mean, she knew very well that the video of her beating up her husband at the restaurant is all over the internet, and she has had first-hand experience of spreading scandalous rumours on social media, so she would've been well aware of how news like this is practically unavoidable.   \n\nEDIT: What's with Geon-hu being paired up with Su-ah all of a sudden? And just because she showed some semblance of kindness to him by pressing an elevator button? Both Su-ah's so-called character development and the pairing with Geon-hu come across as an afterthought, a half-hearted detail shoehorned into the last episode, to give everyone a happy ending and pack it all up with a neat little bow on top. Happy for Sun-jae and Hae-yi though.    \n\nAlso, that thing with Hae-yi wanting to move to Japan with her biological mom seems to have panned out [the way I predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/11hxroa/comment/jawnvi9/), but it was kind of a low-hanging fruit all along, so not really surprised. But was it just me, or did anyone else find it odd that the matter was never brought up again between Hae-yi and Haeng-seon/Jae-woo after that letter from the bio mom? It's like one moment they were drawing boundaries and giving each other the silent treatment and then the next moment they were back to being chummy with each other like the good ol' days.",

Seeing her make such a wonderful turnaround is honestly one of my favorite parts of the series.

Very solid ending for most of the main and supporting characters, but I do think this show could have benefited from being about 2-3 episodes longer. \n\nOne last thought on this show is...murder sub-plots do not sense always make. I think if it's not going to be on equal footing with the other plotlines, it's forgettable and in this case, I find that to be painful.

Hae-yi's internal conflicts about her adopted mother vs biological mother have been foreshadowed throughout the series so the writer's decision to incorporate the biological mother arc doesn't come as a surprise. And I was openminded about it. \n\nBut then fast-forward to episode 16, Hae-yi did not reach an epiphany / new conclusion regarding her insecurities about being a burden to NHS. Yea I get that Hae-yi addressed NHS as her mom again after CSAT but how did she get there? Now that Hae-yi has a relationship with her biological mother, she's ok?\n\nThe biological mother arc is low key more frustrating than the pre-episode 14 serial killer arc imo.",

            "comment": "I liked this ending. There was quite a few missteps with the overall message, but I think it gets it's point across fairly well. I am neutral right now about how &gt;!Mr. Ji's plot!&lt; ended. But after giving it some thought, I think that abrupt end may have been the point the writers were attempting to make. &gt;!There was not many other ways someone who's entire family broke from the societal pressure could have ended up.!&lt; Not unless they seek help, like in Sua or even Sun-Jae's case.\n\nAs for &gt;!how Hae-e handled the whole mom debacle!&lt; I don't hate it, I just wish there was more than an episode and a few hints sprinkled throughout the show to resolve that. I think &gt;!She brought moving as a way to get her birth mom to leave her family alone. Like Yeongju said, her and Haengseon are far too noble for their own good. But she is also still a kid, and I think she needed closure and along the way may have gotten her hopes up a little.!&lt; Again, I wish some of Hae-e's actual thoughts toward her birth mom were explored more throughout the show. \n\nThat might be my biggest issue with the show, is beyond a hint here and there, there is never any solid indication of anyone's true feelings or emotions beyond Chiyeol falling for Haengseon. \n\n~Anyway, I have some vindication about my secret opinion that Jeon Doyeon was styled so homely because she was just so resigned to her life until Chiyeol. I also have some opinions about the fact that, in comparison to the other characters, she is always smiling so brightly, and she doesn't seem to care about the lines that have come from that. I am looking forward to Kill Boksoon and continuing to explore JDY's filmography, she's very quickly become one of my new favorite actresses since I started this show, and I'm sad it came to an end so fast.",

I\u2019ve loved every week, including reading the comments here. Thanks for making my first real-time watch so fun and engaging!\n\nWhat a great cast, especially our leads. JDY gave us a strong, admirable, and loveable NHS. And JKH brought so much charm and emotional depth to CCY. JDY looked gorgeous today, and I love that her \u201cglow-up\u201d comes from wearing an expression of contentment and purpose rather than a better wardrobe lol. I\u2019m living for NHS &gt;!student edition: bare-faced, bangs-back, murdering a triangle gimbap. Lol she\u2019s suffering, but doing it for herself in the name of something she loves. And CCY is a supportive king!!&lt; Aww, CCY was soo _Kyungho_ again today!! His pouty whining &gt;!over drinks with his teacher friend (love this friendship so much!), and adorable embarrassment when the students asked for his signature move..,!&lt; Please watch [wise camping life, with the cast of hosplay](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvRi4hnUzW2hzt0XwnbpghFv3ZEaNF8lQ ) if you want to understand what I mean. This man is SO funny, and overflowing with aegyo! Anyway, the &gt;!double proposal was sweet, I knew NHS wouldn\u2019t be mad at him for coffee-gate, but I enjoyed his freak-out and Hyo-won coaching him on how to navigate life (congratulations on your promotion!&lt; Hyo-won!\ud83d\ude04 Fighting!)\n\nNow I\u2019m a forgiving viewer but I do have some criticisms of the finale. Ofc I teared up during the &gt;!cut of Hae-e and mini Hae-e running to NHS calling \u201ceommaaaa\u201d! But I\u2019m disappointed they didn\u2019t include a heart to heart between them after bio mum left. Hae-e was cold asf to NHS which wasn\u2019t necessary even if she wanted to stop being a \u201cburden\u201d and leave. We just needed a tender moment with Hae-e apologising, and Haeng-seon reassuring her she\u2019d choose to be her mum again in every lifetime. I\u2019m really not interested in bio mum keeping in touch. She was only sorry about how the situation made her feel, not how her actions affected anybody else. Characters like that don\u2019t deserve a redemption arc, even if it\u2019s a tidy ending. Like Su-a\u2019s mother\u2026 This drama was a damning indictment of the education system and controlling parents. Yet they gave the worst perpetrator a job training new parents? Presumably on how to make sure their kids will need therapy?!&lt; You what mate?\n\nSpeaking of tidy endings, &gt;!Hae-Jae and Su-Hu lol.. they really can\u2019t resist pairing everyone up in kdrama land. I\u2019m not too mad, but I\u2019d have loved to see the kids just growing up as besties. It would\u2019ve left room for a nice spin off maybe! Oh also Yeong-Woo\u2026 the execution of this romance was a missed opportunity to craft something organic, and give positive realistic representation to people with autism. The scene with Dan-Ji\u2019s mother landed really badly, I don\u2019t know what anyone was thinking.!&lt;\n\nWelp that was more negative than I have planned lol, but on the flip side I\u2019ve been defending this drama with my life here week after week so there\u2019s the balance \ud83e\udd23 overall a lot more good than bad, and I can honestly say it\u2019s brought me so much joy every week! Off to watch When The Devil Calls Your Name now, to fill the big CCiR shaped hole in my heart \ud83e\udd72",

The cast was phenomenal (supporting cast was flawless) and I really enjoyed the romance and comedy :)  \nI do think the writing got a little weak towards eps 15 and 16 - Mr Ji's conclusion felt very rushed and the payoff was weak. They should have either fleshed out more on Mr Ji's ending or just cut down the murder plot to balance it out (we spent so much time focusing on the side murder mysteries just for it end like that once he's cornered...eh, very unsatisfactory).\n\n The way SuA suddenly had a 180 redemption and ended up with geonhu felt quite out of left field for me... I didn't like it. I really like how Sunjae's family reconciled and rebuilt things. So lovely to see Huijae and his mom get along well, after all that drama! It was also quite abrupt how Haeyi's mom left and Haeyi returned to normal with Haengseon. Overall still a solid 9/10 for me, would recommend!!!",

I had to adjust my lens to ignore it and enjoy the rest of the story. \n\nIf you're going to do a murder mystery/thriller story do it well. What I don't like is when they mix murder mystery stories in Rom coms and don't address it properly. This story really didn't need any of that, it could have just been a heart warming drama about friendship and family.",

I wouldn't have mind if we never saw her! It would have been way better if episode 16 was just a happy one where everyone goes on cute dates! Still excited to see the few scenes of romance we are going to get when the horrible fake Mom goes back to Japan!\nWow! The fake mom is really the worst, was it really worth it to bringer her back to waste scenes on her?\n\nLol, they completely ignored the mom situation like it never happened! Still a sweet ending even though the first half was a waste of time!",

It was fun to discuss every week with all of you.\n\nThe last 2 episodes have been a bit of a letdown because of the messy writing and the difficulty in pulling together all the storylines. Our main couple was so solid and uncomplicated that they needed to fill things up with other characters and it was hit or miss, but mostly miss.\n\n\\- I think we all wanted to see the high schoolers all grown up and the &gt;!bar scene with them drinking and talking!&lt; was good.\n\n\\- Geon-hu going for &gt;!Su-a!&lt; was out of left field, but he's never been a predictable one and I am glad she has found her balance.\n\n\\- Hae-i and Seon-jae &gt;!getting together!&lt; felt rushed. I was hoping they would spend more time on them.\n\n\\- That scene with Dan-ji's mom marveling at how &gt;!Jae-woo had managed to get Young-ju pregnant!&lt; was really in poor taste. Hwang Bora is a master at delivering cringy lines as someone clueless, but they could have spared us.\n\n\\- The fact that everyone was &gt;!redeemed!&lt; in the end and that Su-a's omma ended up &gt;!working at the Pride!&lt; was bittersweet. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this drama and became even more of a Jung Kyung-ho fan. Waiting for Jeon Do-yeon as a contract killer in Kill Boksoon later this month.",

            "comment": "Episode 16 is much better imo than Ep 15.\n\nIn Ep 15, Royal Consort Ji's death was just brushed over, and in Ep 16, Hae-ee's behaviour towards Heong Seon is just accepted and not spoken about again. I felt there wasn't a real closure with those 2 storylines. I miss the heart-to-heart conversations which Hae-ee and Heong-Seon had at the earlier episodes.\n\nI really enjoyed the high school gang. Wouldn't mind another series with all of them together again. Still wondering whether Geon Hu really like Hae-Ee or just feeling competitive with Sunjae as there's was nothing from him since the public proposal in the class. Either way, I would have been okay whether Hae Ee ended up alone.\n\nThe birth mum storyline was unnecessary. I wished they spent more time on the existing people like the kids, or Su-A's mum, or Sunjae's mum. Also didnt like the Jae Woo and Yeong Jae storyline. Still have just left it as is. It was a noona dongsaeng relationship, I can't buy into the romance there.\n\nOverall a good noona romantic comedy but still can't beat RIABB as too many things were happening in the background and distracted from the main couple.",

Hae yi running to her mom made me bawl - I have loved this duo, more than any thing else. \n\nHowever, I absolutely do not agree with the treatment of Jae woo's arc, felt really forced and it seemed like his disability had been taken advantage of somehow. I was initially impressed by the manner in which the show represented neurodivergents, but it all came crashing down in the last episode. Imagine if the bestie and Jae woo were to switch genders, how criminally wrong it'd seem. A stellar acting(kudos to Oh Eui Shik!!) razed to the ground by a poor storyline.",

            "comment": "Final Thoughts\n\nI worried about the ending. A lot. The ending makes or breaks a drama for me. It determines whether I am able to rewatch it or not. I am happy to say that they did such a fantastic job with wrapping up this show. I wasn't disappointed.\n\nWhat I loved\n\nThe chemistry that JKH and JDY have is not something you find often nowadays. It's electric and the heart of this show. Without them, this show would've fallen flat.\n\nThe casting was well thought out for every cast member. All of them are extremely talented. They brought a dead script to life and had us hooked for weeks.\n\nBest scene of the entire drama was that hug between Haeyi and Haengseon. There were real tears falling. It was just so beautiful. \n\nHaeyi's mom being selfless for once. Appreciate that. \nI loved that everyone got a happy ending. I also appreciated that they showed us a bit of everyone's future.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nThe writing and directing was not good. \n\nIf it wasn't for JDY and JKH having great chemistry and being talented actors this show wouldn't have been as enjoyable.\n\nThere was a lot of build up for every storyline and every single storyline was anticlimactic. There was just so much happening, you could actually feel that the writer got overwhelmed after episode 10 and somehow, somewhere, whatever message they were trying to convey got lost.\n\nThere was just too much story to tell for 16 episodes. Off the top of my head, I can name so many abandoned storylines. Sua having hallucinations? CCY's eating disorder? CCY not having any real reaction to Mr Ji unaliving himself....should that have not highlighted the severity of pressure these students are having? Should he have not tried to encourage healthy studying methods and at least disciplining the parents? NHS and Haeyi's relationship deserved a heartfelt mother and daughter heart to heart conversation.\n\nAll the negatives definitely don't out weigh the good. Overall I think this is my favorite kdrama romcom ever. It's been so lovely discussing it with everyone weekly.",

            "comment": "Final thoughts on the best series that gave my 2023 an amazing start:\n\nSo so happy about the finale! Loved that we got a double proposal and Choi Chi-yeol and Nam Haeng-seon wearing the double rings even after years made me so happy. I love this couple so much! They gave me all the giggles and swoon. They deserve all the credit for the double digit ratings! We didn't get a wedding but that ending reminded me of Princess Hours(one of my most fav dramas) and I giggled so hard when CCY carried NHS- throwback to the time NHS carried CCY lol! The kisses were so cute. Special shoutout to the stylist who finally decided to get rid of Haengseon's bangs cause we could finally see the beuatiful face of Jeon Do-yeon. What a beautiful woman! Wish they had this hairstyle throughout!\n\nNam Hae-yi is my most fav character in CCIR because the girl showed what a strong character is without having to be rude or an asshole. Roh Yoon-su has impressed me right from Our Blues and now looking forward to se her as the lead.\n\nEverything got resolved peacefully. So that's a huge relief. This is the CCIR I fell in love with! I liked that the moms are letting their kids be their own selves. I loved CCY having Hyewon as his new teaching asst and his students cheering him was so cute.\n\nTwo things I didn't like:\n\n1. Geon-hu and Su-a line hinted. Su-a had character development, yes. Doesn't mean she has to get together with Geon-hu. I can see why Geon-hu flirts with her cause he's a natural charmer but if they had hinted it, it should've been Danji cause that girl had actual chemistry with Geon-hu and right from the beginning she had a crush on him. Clearly they didn't do it because Danji isn't conventionally pretty. Cowards! BTW still wished Hae-yi just stayed friends with Sun-jae\n2. The storyline between Jae-woo and Yeong-ju. Never liked it from the beginning. They were family, for god's sake! It looks incestuous when neither of them had secret feelings. Kdrama writers should understand that not everyone needs to become a couple!\n\nSaying goodbye to one of the best dramas I've watched this year! Cheers to middle-aged romances!",

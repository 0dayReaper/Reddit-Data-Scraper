            "comment": "&gt;Lee Yeon (Lee Dong Wook) gets involved in an unexpected case that leads him to travel back in time to the year 1938. There, Lee Yeon meets Ryu Hong Joo (Kim So Yeon) again. She was once a guardian spirt of a mountain in the west, but in 1938 she is the owner of the best high-end restaurant Myoyeongak in the capital city of Gyeongseong. When Ryu Hong Joo met Lee Yeon for the first time, she was fascinated by him, but she couldn\u2019t have him. Now, she meets him again and she feels excitement. Lee Yeon also meets his younger brother Lee Rang (Kim Bum).\n&gt;\n&gt;Meanwhile, Cheon Mu Young (Ryu Kyung Soo) used to be a guardian spirit of a mountain in the east and he used to be friends with Lee Yeon and Ryu Hong Joo. A case led Cheon Mu Young to become hostile towards him. Lee Yeon struggles to go back to the present day where his loved one lives.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/Tale_of_the_Nine_Tailed_1938)",

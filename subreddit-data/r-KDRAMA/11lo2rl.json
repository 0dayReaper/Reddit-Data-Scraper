This is my first time watching  a Korean variety show, and I was so excited to see all my fav male actors like Bogum, Ji Chang wook, Park Seo joon, and Kwak Deong yeon.  \n\nI have not watched any dramas of Hwang In yeop but became a fan after watching him on this show.. he is such a cutie and is so funny and entertaining \ud83d\ude06.  Kwak Deong yeon, too, is so funny and is so similar to his character in Gaus Electronics. Bogum is so well-mannered and very kind, like Choi Taek\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI almost died laughing during the  flying chairs segment of this show. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/z8AUQea_Zxk?feature=share\n\nOverall, I am having so much fun watching the show, and it feels so good to see my fav actors interact with each other outside dramas and hope they make more shows like this with other actors.",

The writing is some of the best I've seen in a kdrama, it really shows how sometimes you can say a lot with very little. It really reminds me of My Mister (one of my favourite kdramas) and there is a moving sense of melancholy, but also occasionally very funny moments.",

On the negative side of the ledger, Episode 15 brought the mystery/crime storyline to an abrupt end, and the return of &gt;!Hae-e's birth mother!&lt; caused some conflict among the members of Nation's Best Banchan. In addition, I felt that &gt;!Young-ju and Jae-woo getting together!&lt; was a misstep on the filmmakers' part. On a positive note, there were some sweet moments, especially the exchanges between the Woorim High School friendship group. The final episode, by and large, wrapped up all of the storylines in a satisfactory manner. It was especially pleasing to see the redemptive moments for characters who had ostensibly behaved like villains earlier in the series. And finally, our lead couple were able to have the &gt;!precious ending they richly deserved!&lt;.",

I have had such disabling anxiety and very poor self-esteem (maybe remnants of depression) so I decided to try it and not tell anyone irl except for my family. Idk why, I mean, not much happened but I already feel like this could work. Hoping for the best and feeling super proud of myself. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\udc4f\n\n\nAnyways, I'm currently watching:\n\n**Dr. Romantic 2** (4/16) and I am in love with the drama! IT\u2019S SO GOOD. Finally something that makes me want to binge it. I usually don\u2019t care for characters' backstories and stuff but I love them in this drama! \ud83d\ude0c\n\nI'm also thinking about starting **YOU** S4 soon. My brother has convinced me to watch it by saying it takes place in London this time and he's a literature teacher there this time. That will be too many dramas though and I don't think I can watch so many at the same time because the second part of **The Glory** is coming out and I'm hella excited for it.\n\nAh, I'm also watching **Taxi Driver 2** and **Heavenly Idol** and enjoying them a lot! \ud83d\ude0c",

The high school kids deserved more screentime than their nasty mothers. The found family dynamics deserved more screentime than the murder mystery. If only the entire second half of the show had been like the last episode. 7/10 Stars\n\n(Thailand) **Moonlight Chicken** (8/8) - A lovely BL relationship drama that tells a complex story in a simple way. All the characters and their relationship journeys are very relatable, all of them  grow as individuals and couples throughout the show. A very satisfying watch. Highly recommended. 10/10 Stars\n\n**Watching:-**\n\n**Call It Love** (4/16) - Am loving this slow burn romance between two borderline depressed people. We are at the stage where both are in denial of their feelings and I can't wait to see them realise their mutual attraction. \n\n(China) **Love Between Fairy and Devil** (14/36) - It's a pleasant watch. Nothing outstanding and I'm never dying to know what happens next. So it's a good one to watch during the daily commute.\n\n**Once Upon A Small Town** (3/12) - Another pleasant watch. The rural setting is a nice change and the characters are likeable. Am already feeling bad for the cute SML.\n \n(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (3/8) - I expected spice and fluff, this is spice and trauma. But it does add a lot of weight to a simple 'friends with benefits' story. Am loving it!\n\n**All The Liquors** (2/8) - A very cute romcom between a foodie who loves alcohol and a chef who hates alcohol. Korean BLs have been quite disappointing lately, and I'm hoping this one maintains its quality till the end.\n\n**Dropped:-**\n\n(Japan) **First Love** -  The slow pace, the constant flashbacks, and the melancholy vibe got too much after a time. Can't sit through 6 more episodes of the same repetitive angst. Dropped after 3 episodes.",

Since it's just a few more episodes I'll likely hang in until the finale.\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** (10/20) Halfway through and I have no idea where this is going. Story isn't too interesting but today's episode where &gt;! Jeon So-Nee and Park Hyung Sik talk candidly over dinner and soju about live, love and her personal freedom was the first time I really got to like the FL. !&lt;\n\n**Taxi Driver Season 2** (4/16) This one never disappoints and has been fantastic every new episode. &gt;! I replayed episode 1 with Wang Tao Zi and Madam Li far tooooo many times, I love Lee Je Hoon's versality and charisma.!&lt; I'm waiting on Episode 5 until Episode 6 this weekend since watching only one episode per week is just not sufficient.\n\n**Jinnys Kitchen** (2/10) I've always enjoyed Youn's Kitchen and variations of it so I knew I'd watch Jinny's Kitchen if it was available for US viewers. Thank goodness it is!\n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** (1/12) Here for Cho Seung Woo.\n\nIn between I'm watching older episodes of **Hangout with Yoo**, **Boys Planet** and wrapping up the last few episodes of **My Love from the Star.**",

I want to watch the leads' other work now, too. \n\nWatching:\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** (10/20): I'm enjoying this drama, even if it isn't everyone's cup of tea. I like all the characters, I'm intrigued by the mystery, I love the conversations and reveals from the last two episodes. I've been watching a string of dramas with strong female characters and some feminist themes, recently (**Hit the Spot**, **Love to Hate You**) and I'm surprised to be able to consider this one in the same light. That drunken dinner conversation was pretty great, though.\n\n**If you Wish Upon Me** (5/16): This is the drama for impressive cheekbones, I swear. Also, I could listen to Ji Chang Wook mutter all day (though it's not as great as him screaming into his pillow in frustration in **Lovestruck in the City**). The story is fine, but I'm really here for JCW.",

Honestly, this kind of flow is the perfect romcom for me. It really stays romantic and funny until the end - there's angst and mystery, but it doesn't take away the lightheartedness. I loved all the couples and there's some gooood kissing in this show. Would totally rewatch some episodes of this as a comfort show.\n\n**Watching:**\n\n**Call It Love (4/16)** \\- I don't love melos but I'm obsessed with this show. It's unsettling and comforting at the same time. \n\n**Extraordinary Attorney Woo (10/16)** \\- This is very nice as a slow watch. Binged through the first couple episodes but the courtroom scenes get a little repetitive when you watch them back to back. So I'm only watching an episode here and there now and it's very enjoyable that way.\n\n**Crash Course in Romance (12/16)** \\- My netflix is a couple weeks behind so I can't watch more right now. I peaked in the on-air-threads and will probably wait until all the episodes are out in my country and then just binge them all at once.\n\n**On Hold:**\n\n**Unlock my Boss (8/12) -** I don't have a specific reason for pausing this, I just wasn't in the mood. Will probably finish at some point to see how the &gt;!romance !&lt;works out.\n\n**The Tale of Nokdu (7/16) -** I liked this just fine, but I don't know if I will finish it.

I enjoy waiting to see what our priest will do \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t really know how it\u2019ll end but it\u2019s been a good watch so far! \n\n**Call It Love (4/16):** I\u2019m actually watching ep 5 right now lol. I really don\u2019t know what the company does (are they a marketing company??) but I\u2019m invested in the characters and that\u2019s what really matters, especially with a show like this that\u2019s character driven. I\u2019m enjoying it overall, interested to see how everyone develops! The editing choices are weird though like the pink hue and the squished look to the flashbacks \n\n**Delivery Man (1/12):** 1st episode was alright. The show is nothing crazy but I can see it being enjoyable! It\u2019s not on the top of my priority list but I will finish watching it even if I don\u2019t keep up with it airing. \n\n**Empress Ki (9/51):** No progress made in the last 1-2ish weeks \n\n**On Hold**\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity (8/16):** I indeed did fall behind and I have no desire to keep watching right now \ud83d\ude02 if I don\u2019t touch this by the end of August it\u2019s probably a wrap for the show for me\u2026 I think a main issue for me was the fact &gt;!FL really had no clue ML is a supernatural being. I was told in the weekly thread she found out ep 12 but I can\u2019t wrapped my head around her realizing so late???!&lt; He literally told her so many times \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f there was also just a lack of cohesion with everything going on, I could not lol. ML\u2019s acting was good though and I liked how pretty some of the scenes were. Nice osts too. \n\n**Recently Completed**\n\n**Can We Be Strangers:** Finished this while it aired but missed last week\u2019s what are you watching post \ud83d\ude02 Lackluster ending, the main leads had no growth by the end. The ending was literally them &gt;!finally going off and starting to grow with the uncertainty of their future.!&lt;The 2nd leads relationship was rather weird. SML would do anything to stay with SFL. SFL would bend sometimes but barely or it would be a big issue before she did. Idk but the show just slapped 2 extremes together and called it a day. \n\nI could\u2019ve done without watching because the show ended the exact way it started but I did enjoy watching the show every week to an extent so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 7.5/10\n\nAddition: the show ended the way it should have with the &gt;!leads not ending up together. It just grinds my gears the way they made no personal progress until the very end. And we have to think up our own conclusions for them since it was left on a open ending.!&lt;\n\n**Crash Course in Romance**: Loved it overall!!! Episodes 14-16 had a bit too much going on but everything wrapped up nicely in the end \ud83d\ude0a I was happy to see everyone getting their happy ending too!! \ud83e\udd70 My biggest complaints after finishing is probably the way &gt;!Mr. Ji\u2019s!&lt; storyline ended  and the throw in of &gt;!Hae-Yi\u2019s bio mom for her to leave the way she did and FL and Hae-Yi never speaking about it on camera after she left.!&lt; Overall 9/10 \ud83d\udc9c I\u2019m gonna miss it for sure \ud83e\udd72 loved Anyway couple and my high school squad \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe\n\nEdit: fixed spoiler warning",

The storyline was choppy, but the characters were developed pretty well. \n\n**My Lethal Man** (Chinese) I\u2019m surprised how much I enjoyed this romantic melodrama. I found some BTS on YouTube and am loving them, even though they are mostly not subtitled. Fan Zhi Xin has an impressive ability to convey much with little dialog. \n\nCurrently watching:\n\n**Run On** \n\n**Love to Hate You**\n\n**Peak Time** Boys Planet was so boring, but Peak Time is fun. I can\u2019t explain it.  \n\n**Hyena**",

The Korean translation is \"One Shot Scandal\" and that really doesn't describe it either. What's the deal with these titles? But title aside, the actors were pure joy in this! \n\n**Love to Hate You -**  I binged this one, due to the recommendations on this thread last week. And it was indeed an excellent one! Thanks to you all who recommended it! Can't believe I've never seen these actors before.... \n\n**Heavenly Idol -**  I'm still tuned in because of Kim Min Kyu, but not really into it yet. I'm on episode 4. I'll give it a little bit more before I drop it. \n\n**Pachinko -** I've picked this up again. I want to finish it. It's so well done and I've read the book. So I want to finish it. \n\n**Our Blooming Youth -**  Not quite into this one yet, either. I'll watch a few more episodes before I decide to finish it. \n\nI want to finish **My Liberation Notes** and watch **Island.**  Waiting for Part Two of **The Glory** and a few other new ones. I've been traveling this week, so there has not been much time to watch my shows.",

I\u2019m happy that the writer from the first half of season 1 returned, apparently.\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity (12/16)**: I\u2018ve written enough about it elsewhere, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m disappointed - but I like KJH\u2019s acting too much to drop it, unfortunately for me.\n\n**Zombie detective (6/12)**: it\u2019s very funny and I looove Park Ju-hyun and her character! The writing could be better imo but I like the angle they\u2019re going for with the actual monster vs human \u201cmonster\u201c theme, kind of similar to Happiness in the message, which I liked as well. I like the brother-in-law and his obsession with zombies lol - I just wish him being treated badly by his wife wasn\u2019t played up for laughs because it\u2019s not funny to me in the slightest. I had seen (well, heard mostly) Choi Jin-hyuk only in Mr Queen before this and I find his acting and narrating good here as well.\n\n**Delivery man (1/12)**: casually checked this out because I really liked Yoon Chan-young in Hope or Dope, but I\u2019m not too keen on ghosts and there are too many taxis in my kdramas lately lol, so we\u2019ll see, not sure I\u2019ll keep watching.\n\n**The Last Of Us (4/9)**: I\u2019m behind but planning to catch up.\n\nAlso finished **Love to Hate You.** I LOVED it. I started it because I found the premise very  very interesting and it was definitely up to my expectations. Loved (almost) everyone\u2019s performance. I wish it wasn\u2019t so short!\n\nWaiting for **The Glory 2**. Usually revenge stories don\u2019t interest me that much, but this and Taxi Driver are the exceptions, for different reasons. I don\u2019t know what to expect from part 2 but I loved the performances by the \u201cvillain\u201d group and their characterisation in part 1 enough to find it compelling, despite it not being perfect for my taste.",

Too many useless storylines, thriller plot foremost, too many irritating characters, nothing out of the ordinary, everyone gets a reprieve in the end. Disappointment for its potential, a kind 6.5 because I can't fault JKH.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **Kokdu, Season of Deity (12/16):** pretty much a KJH one-man show, poor ISH can't get writing to give her FL character some depth and plot is all but a mess. A fun show though, a lot of moving pieces and the ML's multidimensional performance carries. Flawed, yet enjoyable;\n\n\\- **Delivery Man (3/12):** standard ghost story with a bit of emotion and some nice comedy. Minah is stunning and her FL has the right amount of attitude, not full in on the ML but he has the looks. Not surprising, not bad though.\n\nTo these I plan to get back on track with **Divorce Attorney Shin** and maybe a backlog or two.",

I liked the family aspect, especially the grandpa, but also the character progression of thr ML's family members. This is also my first completed Park Bo Gum drama, and I loooved him, so much that he is my second favorite actor even though I don't particularly like this drama. That never happens to me. What a talented man. Makes me excited for his next drama (with IU, my favorite actress ... hello, is this a dream???). As for things I didn't like \u2014 the moms mostly, but also how the plot progresses in general. For a good portion of it, it feels like nothing is happening. I don't like that. 6/10.\n* **Crash Course in Romance (16/16)** \u2014 I would say the latter half of the drama is weaker in the first, but it's still enjoyable. Some plot lines were useless or dropped out of nowhere. Do I care? Yes. But do I care a lot? Not really. What I am bummed about is &gt;!Geon Hu and his ending. He deserves better. Among many things, but he was a favorite of mine, so I wanted to complain about this.!&lt; What I loved was the excitement I felt watching the episodes, not because I was really looking forward to them, but because I'd watch them and immediately go over to my Reddit chats, and we'd freak out together. It's so fun. 8.5/10. Has its flaws, but I would recommend. Cute, fluffy, light, some murder plot no one cares about, and Shin Jae Ha should win an award. Now everyone refers to him as Mr. Ji, even when they're talking about other dramas like Taxi Driver. Just saying. He was iconic.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Kingdom (2/6)** \u2014 How do the episodes get even more exciting? So far, loving the progression of events. The cast is wonderful, the zombies are scary, and I just want the characters to succeed. Hoping for the best.\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (12/16)** \u2014 Seeing the episodes get closer to the number 16 feels good. Two more weeks of torture, and I can put it in the challenge list and breathe a sigh of relief. I don't know how I'm enduring it. I'm not \u2014 that's the secret. I suffer in silence.\n* **Taxi Driver (5/16)** \u2014 Sad that this week and next week both have 1 episode airing. Oh, well. I did enjoy this episode a bit. Mostly cause I love Go Eun. \n* **Our Blooming Youth (10/20)** \u2014 Honestly thought I'd be more excited for this drama, but my interest is fading. I'll complete it because I no longer drop on-air dramas, but I don't particularly care anymore. Also, I love looking at Park Hyung Shik. He works so well as a CP. \n* **Vincenzo (10/20)** \u2014 Speeding through cause I already watched the first 8 episodes before. Zoomed through them then watched episodes 9 and 10 at a normal pace. Yes, I officially picked it up now. Finally. Gotta say, I love it so much. All three leads are great. It's exciting, and the OST is so great. Can't wait to watch the second half.\n\nSlowly Watching:\n\n* **Reset (2/10)** \u2014 Finally got to slowly watching dramas I've dropped, all the while crocheting so I don't have to endure something I dislike. Really, it's background noise, but I understand enough Korean to tell what's happening.\n* **Two Weeks (6/16)** \u2014 While watching this passively, I'm gushing over how cute the little girl is, but then the character Im Seung Woo shows up and I realize that it's our dear Cha Jung Hwan from My Father is Strange, who I loved. Then I realized I'm loving his character in this drama as well because he is the sweetest thing to the little girl. Then I press on the actor, Ryu Soo Young, in MDL, and he's gonna be in Bloodhounds??? Which already has my favorite actor???? And a stellar cast??? As if I wasn't excited enough already. This turned into a paragraph about Ryu Soo Young, and not Two Weeks. I don't care. I love him.",

            "comment": "I just finished **First Love**. Overall I liked it. I would say about 8.5/10. I liked the multiple timeline narration. And i liked the acting of the main leads, both young and older. I also liked the sign language scenes a lot. I do think it was quietly dramatic. The themes of fate, unavoidable and fixed and changeable and timing of relationships were done well but also very dramatic. It was shot beautifully and I love the older actress that played Yae. \nI think that it did very well was portray how some parents want to control their children's lives and then end up making things worse for all parties involved. \n\nTowards the end a couple of things weren't clear to me. Like &gt;!when did the ML hurt himself and stop being a pilot. If he was ridden by guilt and felt responsible for Yae's accident then how come he got over his guilt so quickly. Just because Yae got her memory back?!&lt; \n\n I wasn't a fan of the way they did the ending tbh. I would have preferred a stronger ending than such a wishy-washy one. They could have tightened the narrative and done it in fewer episodes.\n\nI think I am now taking a break as I am travelling for a few days.",

Easy to watch, actors are cute, simple and straight forward plot so far. Already better than \"Individual Circumstances\".\r  \n\r  \n**Call it Love** (6/16) \u2014 This slow melodrama is awesome. I am actually really looking forward to Wednesdays now. Except for the stupid pink filter. I know there is a reason (the color is going to shift based on the mood I guess? that's according to something I read so happy to be corrected). Working on today's episodes as I type this. \n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (6/12) \u2014 I got caught up to the current (today's) episode and will probably watch both of this week's episodes tomorrow. What a strange little show. Acting is great but story is too slow for me. Wish it would speed up a bit.\r  \n\r  \n**Jinny\u2019s Kitchen** (2/10) \u2014 Super entertaining. And all of the actors are getting (or are already there) too famous for this. But it's fun to watch.\r  \n\r  \n**Hotel Del Luna** (14/16) \u2014 I still am really enjoying this one. I had plans to finish it this last weekend but had several things up come up. \n\nCompleted:\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** \u2014 I loved this intensely, even the episodes not everyone liked. This drama is so brilliant! I can't wait to watch it again in a few months to pick up all the little things I missed. \r  \n\r  \nNon-Korean:\r  \n\r  \n**The End of the World With You or Bokura no Micro na Shuumatsu** (6/8) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 What a strange show. I still really like Ritzu, the bastard he is, but this last episode added some real character growth. \r  \n\r  \n**Bed Friend** (3/8) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames \u2014 I loved the book and, wow, its a steamy, messy, story about friends with benefits that fall in love. It's something else and NetJames are definitely carrying this. Fantastic chemistry!\r  \n\r  \n**Jack o\u2019Frost** (3/6) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 couple just breaks up when one has an accident and can\u2019t remember the other at all. So of course the one tries to win his partner back and make him fall in love again. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop...probably soon since this is such a short drama. But the actors and characters are cute.\r  \n\r  \nOn Hold:\r  \n\r  \n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (6/16)\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** (2/20) \n\n**Island** (6/12) or rather I finished Island Part 1 and now need to watch Part 2\n\nI can't get into any of these still. So dropping all of them for now. Will maybe pick them back up sometime soon.",

With this week's focus on the possibility of &gt;!'justified' murder or perhaps vigilante justice is more accurate from FL's perspective!&lt;, I found myself reexamining some of the moral views I hold -- especially as a fan of revenge dramas.\n\n**Delivery Man** (3/12) Enjoying this lots, especially for FL's performance. The comedy is not constant but when it comes, it's surprisingly hit my funny bone every single time. Not the most revolutionary drama but solid and enjoyable with the story it is telling.\n\n**Island 2** (4/6) I honestly *lost it* when we had the &gt;!water hose holy water exorcism in the school yard!&lt; in the latest episode. Like laughing until tears came out kind of lost it. I don't doubt the original webtoon was beloved and fun to read *but* I do want to know what they were thinking when they were doing the scripts for the drama live action adaptation. I get the feeling if there was a survey for bad adaptations of source material, this would rank pretty high. But you know what, the entire cast looks good so I'll just keep watching for the pretty.\n\n**Gye Baek** (15/36) Picked it up again after a break and am glad I did because past few episodes covered a huge turning point for ML, whose character I had been getting frustrated with previously. There's a lot of fight scenes in this drama and I can't help but marvel at how 'simplistic' fight scenes used to be.\n\n**Cruel Temptation** (104/129) I just *can't* with FL's family -- how can they be so cruel and messed up. \u53ef\u601c\u4e4b\u4eba\u5fc5\u6709\u53ef\u6068\u4e4b\u5904\u3002\n\n**My Uncanny Destiny** (cdrama 15/24) This short web drama is the perfect fluffy, silly romance that I needed to balance out the serious/makjang stuff I\"m watching. It's ridiculously fluffy and silly -- and the dialogue is so fun (probably not so much in translation though). \n\nFinally shout out to kpop idol survival show **Peak Time** -- loving the performances and super excited to see more!",

That was the group of locals who were upset because they thought he was giving her preferential treatment, when they had been advised not to begin their businesses, or change them - for their own good, because they were bad ideas - by the village committee, and blamed him. They think she's just a big-city woman coming to take advantage of their town, and has gotten him into her wiles. They don't understand that she made the decision on her own, to help, and he hasn't been helping her financially or anything. \n\nThe reason she says they need a break is, it seems, that she thinks he's treating her as a child who can't deal with life, and trying to shield her from things she feels perfectly capable of dealing with. She thinks that's a really negative thing - probably some idea of him being a 'typical man' and trying to protect her, when he should just let her deal with it herself. I think it's a feminist trope that men shouldn't act according to how they're wired to act - to protect women/the woman they care about. But it's natural, and actually quite nice. Also, if she does have problems with him doing it without telling her - and it would be better to talk with her about it, so they can deal with it together - then she can talk about that with him, instead of just telling him that he's wrong and going off in a huff.

It was good to get this perspective  Unlike others I didn't mind the change of tone of the series midway which showed the perils of stardom. I couldn't get around to liking the ML. Didn't find him to do awesome looks wise and felt other supporting actors were better looking. He was a damsel in distress with genders reversed  It had some nice supporting characters and male and female friendships. But the big question is is it so tough for a single star to date in SK?\n\n7/10 from me.",

While You Were Sleeping I never got to finish because somehow it was getting a little long for me, but when I saw it yesterday on the same Viki channel, I saw the scene in which Bae Suzy is in a bad situation (where she's given a lethal injection).  I had just finished Melting Me softly--and found it was so good!  Loved the story line.",

I wasn't sold on this initially but about halfway through, when the focus shifted to the more seasoned actors and the trial, I started to get into it. I was blown away by the performances of Lee Sang-Yeob, Kim Won-Hae, Lee Na-Ra, and Jung Hae-In. I was thinking this drama might actually make my Top Ten, and the more junior actors started to grab my attention as well. And then that series of silly vignettes at the end had to go and ruin it for me. What was that? Did they need 15 minutes of filler or something?",

I love Yoon Myeong Joo and Seo Dae Yeong along with the friendships in the drama. \n\n* In the Name of God : A Holy Betrayal (3/8) \nThis is a documentary which shows some real gruesome and graphic stuff. It was really eye opening and honestly I learned some life lessons from this. I began to watch this because I\u2019m into documentaries and true crime. This is another I\u2019ve enjoyed and I honestly am looking forward to watching the next episodes.\n\n* Oasis (1/16)\nI\u2019ve watched the first episode and I heard that many people got bothered by the tan. I also did get quite distracted by it although I did watch the whole episode and apart from that I did find it quite good. \n\n* Taxi Driver S2 (5/16)\nI was waiting for this season for months and honestly I did get quite worried that S2 wouldn\u2019t be at the same standards at S1 but bro this drama is just so fire. Everything is amazing and I loved Wang Tao Zi and Madam Lim\u2019s reunion.",

However, I do think that the cinematography and audio-quality could get overwhelmingly bad sometimes. Not a big fan of how the drama has been directed, especially in the first few episodes. I think overall though its ok and enjoyable. I'm also impressed with the deeper and more emotional elements of the story.",

I am watching **Crash Landing on You** (1st time - LOVING IT!!) but &gt;!the FL gets shot with one bullet - unconscious for 3 days, the lead villian is literally riddled with bullets - still finds enough breath and time to give the ML even more bad news?!&lt;\n\nAny other examples anyone would like to share?",

Has it been two or three days, or a week, or two weeks? It's not made clear a lot of the time. They just show it being daytime, or nighttime, or being at work, or whatever the next scene is. \n\nRelated to this is when, in one scene, it's morning, and the next, it's late afternoon - as though what the characters have been doing has taken *all day*, when it was just doing one thing. Or when it's suddenly nighttime, and it's meant to have taken hours to get from one place to another. I don't know if it's for effect in that second scene, or due to filming conditions - how long it took to get it right - but it happens so often and makes it hard to suspend disbelief.",

I see this plot device in a lot of series: right after the big confession is accepted, the ML or FL disappears for 2 years with little or no word, and in the end, it's not a deal breaker. Huh? At first, I couldn't wrap my brain around this trope. Seriously, there's no way you can't contact me to say 'see you later, babe.' There's no phones? There's no internet? There's no mail carrier with sore feet and a tear-soaked letter? Hell, if none of those are available, you can't even leave a \"Will be back in 5\" written in your own blood on some highly visible place?   ... As I said, I couldn't understand why the plot device pops up so often, until I remembered Korea's mandatory military service, and then it seemed to make more sense to me. So many love affairs have to hit the pause button to accommodate this service requirement or probably a lot of them temporarily falter under the strain. Maybe it's a stretch, but it's the only thing I could come up with to explain why the trope is used so often.",

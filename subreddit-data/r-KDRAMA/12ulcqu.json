The senior students of Sungjin High School are issued with a mobilization order to join a military drill after school. The government uses students' desperation for college acceptance to attract them to join the drill by offering extra credits for admission. With only 50 days left before the CSAT, the students have no choice but to sign up for the training, carrying guns instead of books at school. Will the senior students of Sungjin High School be able to overcome the crisis and survive their last year of high school as soldiers?\n* **Genre**: Action, Thriller, Science-fiction\n* **Previous Discussion:** [Episodes 1-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/128f3m0/duty_after_school_episodes_16/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).

Failure for him meant being stuck in the cycle of poverty and pass it down to future generations like his parents. That fear is what made him lose his mind. However, nothing can justify the &gt;!sexual assault!&lt;. Not even poverty. That's why I cannot understand what the writer was trying to communicate with that.",

Apart from Yeong Soo, none of the characters seem to care about it anymore. If they did, they would still be studying, even if it was just a little bit. However, I think the fact that they still cling to the idea that the CSAT will be held gives them false hope that the world will magically return to normal soon, regardless of the chaos and destruction they see around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why did they not grab their rifles immediately when they saw Jang Soo got shot? This show literally made them all DUMB at the last possible minute.\n\nBecause these kids have never killed a living, breathing person before. They couldn't even take down those &gt;!nasty inmates when Ae Sol's life was at stake!&lt;, let alone their own classmates. If they were to pull the trigger, they'd probably aim for a non-vital part, which would slow down their reaction time. It was quite a contrast to the previous scene before Chi Yeol got knocked out, where they reacted much faster and &gt;!actually got some shots in when they were attacked by spheres!&lt;. &gt;!I guess it just goes to show how different it is when you're faced with a human threat versus an alien one.!&lt;",

What I INFER from the ending is that Chi-yeol is trying to move on by taking the CSAT, but can't because he remembers how his friends died--so he enlists in the service. Ae Sol probably goes back to being alone... and wants to stay that way, unable to get over Bo Ra's death. Yoo Ha Na, who is portrayed as one of the less courageous of the group, is probably stricken with guilt asking herself if she could have done more. Na Ra is in shock and cannot move on. I'm sure in the end, she had full capability of killing Young Soo, but refrained from doing so because she's a big softie inside (killing spheres is not the same as killing people for her)--so she unsuccessfully tried to incapacitate him instead. All four survivors are left with irreparable PTSD in the end... yet the writers have a flowery tone in the ending as if it were some emotional ad. I did not like that lol.!&lt;",

He later finds out that the army was collecting the corpses of slain soldiers in that area for full autopsies and funerals, and Young-soo forgot if he covered up the gunshot wound. He's paranoid that he'll be found out, he's at this point in the webtoon on a mission with people who don't care about the extra points, and he never tried to socialize himself with the group. It's not more justifiable what he did in the webtoon, but it's much clearer that he's a product of a long and arduous war. !&lt;",

When Il Ha discovers his crime, he kills him to cover up what he did (in fear of this will kill his chance to take CSAT). When he learns that the group plans to retrieve Il Ha's body, his paranoia intensifies as he fears being caught. His fear of being exposed leads him to a delusional belief that his classmates are aware of his actions, and he becomes obsessed with the idea that he will never be able to take the CSAT and break out of the cycle of poverty.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This obsession drives him to the brink of madness, and he begins to hallucinate a sphere attack that he believes is killing his classmates. In his delusion, he starts killing his fellow students, leading to the dramatic conclusion of the final episode.!&lt; At least that's my interpretation\n\nMy main critique of the final episode though is that his gradual descent into madness was not adequately developed. The intense, climactic events all occurred in the final 30-40 minutes of the final episode, leaving little time to flesh out his psychological unraveling.  \n\n\nedit: spoiler tag didn't work",

Then Youngsoo aims at Nara, Chiyeol lunges to protect her, and then Nara shoots Youngsoo dead.

Not the same lightning in a bottle they had in the first 6, but they built upon story threads I thought were interesting. Nara x Kimchi was very refreshing because it wasn\u2019t typical kdrama romance pacing, let them be friends and let him have a crush. I honestly thought they were setting it up for it to happen in season 2 (lol). The \u201cnew normal\u201d was cool. Some of the kids not being as well adjusted, while others acted like they were born and bred for it was interesting. Loved the concepts of the loner characters recognizing that the war gave them opportunity to connect. i was excited for more of the characters who were treated like background in the first part. !&lt;\n\n9-10 &gt;! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. why was all of episode 9 the same argument that took place for 50 mins. I stg we just watched people cry, sit in silence, not explain themselves, and then scream as they moved towards someone else to push them. The Class prez was **so** in the right that it was hard for me to even pretend that the others were justified in their anger. sure, no one should have broken the radio. That was dumb, and that guy was a little crazy. But cmon, At least 6 people in that class consistently threw temper tantrums every 5 mins, acted selfishly and nearly got themselves killed like 4 times each. Not to mention the danger they put others in by doing so!!!! So yeah. In order to save their lives, I too would get them to stay in our base by any means necessary while we actively looked for a solution to our radio problem, instead of marching off into the unknown where I *know* there are gonna be more aliens! She and VP did nothing wrong. And then the writers tried to make it seem like if they had presented the problem to the rest of the group they would have understood\u2026.no I don\u2019t believe that. Not after watching 8 episodes of the loudest angriest people constantly making the most rash and selfish decisions that lead to extreme danger. like ik their teenagers but cmon let\u2019s be a little pragmatic people \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 !&lt; \n\nOkay let me rapid fire somethings that didn\u2019t make sense before I get to the big thing. \n\n- &gt;! Why didn\u2019t the radar pick up any spheres if they were the cause of Soo Chuls death? You can\u2019t cop out on rules of your universe for the sake of tension. It\u2019s cheap and rips you right out of the immersion !&lt;\n\n- &gt;! Why would they ride amusement park rides that make a shit ton of noise after they came across a dead squad without any sign of spheres? Not even a 5 year old would do that \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d they\u2019d be so dead!! They didn\u2019t spend months on their own twiddling their thumbs they know how to avoid the things !&lt; \n\n- &gt;! Why didn\u2019t the army show any concern for a squad that instantly cut contact after they learned the thing you\u2019ve been holding over there head was a lie? All that talk about betraying the army in part 1 and not one of those higher ups thought \u201coh we might have accidentally created a rouge militia\u201d ???? !&lt;\n\n- &gt;! When did Soo Chul become some kind of vigilante? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but up until the reveal, Soo chul didnt mourne as much as the other students. Like frankly I didn\u2019t think he cared so deeply for his classmates until he had that monologue. Honestly If I was to think about it I would believe Tae Man would have been the one to go slightly psycho on spheres. He was constantly bummed about everyone they lost. Soo Chul felt so outta left field. Like one second he was like \u201cI like Nara too!\u201d And then all the sudden \u201cI have no problem manipulating my friends for my own agenda. They will be my weapons in this war against the aliens. If one sphere lives, it\u2019ll be over my dead body\u201d. Like DAAAYUUUM \u2018what happened to the original plot of the movie?\u2019 !&lt;\n\n- &gt;! After they discovered Soo Chuls cause of death. Why weren\u2019t they concerned for the lack of notification on the radar?? That\u2019s concerning! Either your radars broke or they found a way to mask their presence. Both not good! !&lt;\n\nOkay finally, the ending &gt;! It was wack. !&lt; \n\n&gt;! Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve seen plenty of \u201cpointless/Sad\u201d ends before. But that one was so\u2026dissatisfying. Normally when one of those ends happens it\u2019s too firmly deliver a theme that the writers really want you to understand. but the problem is\u2026you\u2019ve taken a rocket launcher to an already overly beaten dead horse. !&lt;\n\nThe themes that story presents are so already woven into the nature of the show itself. They are the foundation of the premise,and they are engraved into the bone marrow of each of the characters. Not to mention overtly stated in the plot itself.\n\nIt is impossible to watch a single scene of this drama without thinking one of the following \n\n&gt;! 1. People in power hold the promise of a better world to keep the oppressed in the current awful one.\n2. War is pointless and cruel\n3. What is worth fighting for when the people we are meant to protect are the ones we are making fight for us.\n4. We\u2019ve already lost if children loose hope\n5. We must protect children so they can create a better world.\n5. The government and its people rely on the dehumanization of soldiers to enable their survival and maintain the status quo\n6. At its core, humanity is a simple and selfish creature that prioritizes its individual safety over another\u2019s especially in times of crisis\n7. The ruling class creates no-win situations for those suffering the most\n8. Society pins the suffering against one another. !&lt;\n\nI can go on, but you get the point. \n\n&gt;! So suddenly enforcing these themes one final time by having the thing that kills them be one of their own? Idk it\u2019s just\u2026Like we got it, we understand what you\u2019re trying to say. !&lt;\n\nLet me be clear tho. &gt;! I don\u2019t mind that it was a blood bath. The show had a R rating and was pretty gruesome as it is. If everyone there survived that\u2019d be some bullshit. But idk making one of the kids the cause of 10-12 of their deaths after him only starting to loose his mind less than 30 mins before it happened? It just felt pointless. Like I wasted my time getting to know the characters. Especially because they spent all that time redeeming all the a-holes *including* the guy who did it. !&lt;\n\nBut like I get it. That\u2019s the point. &gt;! they want you to feel this way. War is pointless. We\u2019ve already lost if the children loose hope. !&lt;\n\nBut what was good about this show is that despite these themes. They were uniting. They were overcoming everything with grit and compassion. They were rising above their station and inflicting change.  &gt;! And they sent it all down the drain for more despair edge !&lt;\n\nBut yeah that\u2019s just my two cents\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Jang Young-hoon would have made a 10000x times better nerd than him. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I have never felt so much heart pain while watching a series. Usually you cry when something sad happens, because the characters are sad and you empathize. With this drama though, they made us build up rapport with the characters and made us love them, then tore them away in a single moment that I couldn't help but cry because I didn't wanna lose them... the entire time I was hoping it's a dream still.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Also, I was wondering why at first it was a sphere, then when Kimchi woke up, it was gunshots. It happens in real life too, when you see something so shocking that your brain instantly replaces it with something that you can handle. The script-writing on the whole fiasto that went down was chef's kiss. !&lt;\n\nAlso can we talk about Bo-ra and Ae-seol? \n\n&gt;!First it was Squid Game and now this. My heart broke in a million pieces. I fuckin loved them so much man T\\_T. And in the end, we didn't even get to see how Ae-seol lives now... !&lt;\n\nI was looking forward since it's a 10 episodes kdrama and the last 10eps kdrama I watched had the best kind of ending possible (Happiness), but this one only left me disappointed and very, very angry... \n\nOn another hand, the little MV at the end made me giggle a little.",

Holy mother of HUH?! wot.\n\n&gt;!\\&gt;!Okay first of all, I was a big fan of the manhwa this drama is based on and I honestly didn't mind the changes for the most part. I was confused as to what happened to Won-bin (the sergeant) because I'd have thought he'd still be with the kids but for some reason he was simply written out of the story in part 2 for no apparent reason.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL WAS THAT ENDING?!?! Holy cow I've never been so pissed off by an ending to any K drama ever. I already knew that Yeong-soo was gonna lose his mind and murder some people, but in the manhwa he only manages to kill about three or four people (two of whom he killed before he decided to shoot up the class) before Na-ra is the one to put him down. Granted a lot of the characters in the show were already dead in the manhwa, but seriously? Why the hell did the writers decide to make it a millions times more messed up and depressing? Not to mention most of the characters actually survived (Bo-ra, Yeong-joo, Deok-joon, So-yeon, Tae-man, Young-shin and Hui-rak). I don't know what the hell the writers were thinking deciding to kill off pretty much everyone at the end other than them trying to go for that stupid \"shock factor\" that most writers seem to be trying way too hard to do these days.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And then the end. Like... Chi-yeol just moved on? What about Na-ra, Ha-na and Ae-sol? They survived as well but why the fuck didn't the writers focus on them? WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST STICK TO THE MANHWA'S ENDING?! They would have been able to get the exact same message across by killing just a couple of them but noooooo, they wanted to be extra edgy and kill almost everyone instead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Seriously, fuck this show's ending. I was invested right up until the end when that bullshit happened. !&lt;!&lt;",

            "comment": "WOW.. not gonna lie it's the worst ending ever\n\nThe first part (ep 1-6) really hooked me. Initially, I didn't think it would be that good but when I gave the first episode a try, I immediately got addicted and binged all 6 episodes. The plot for the first part was definitely well-written and the cinematography was amazing. I thought it was pretty similar to sweet home (but i definitely enjoyed it much more than sweet home) NO HATE to sweet home though, I really enjoyed sweet home too and I'm looking forward to part 2 but I would say Duty after school was closer to heart and more realistically portrayed (e.g. how high school kids would actually react if they were thrown into such situations)    \n\n\nOk now time for talk about part 2! spoilers ahead.. \n\nIt started off ok.. the first few minutes just showed &gt;!the highschoolers after about a month, they defintiely matured and became way better at shooting.. i would say probably better teamwork too. (i guess that made sense, they needed to mature in such a  situation especially cause lee chun ho died so they have no adult to guide or lead them) actually, it was quite odd that Kim Won Bin just magically disappeared though.. (no explanation or whatsoever about what happened to his character \\[PLOT HOLE 1\\] !&lt;\n\nNext let's move on to the kids (i mean lowkey adults but they are so immature ugh). \n\n1. lee nara - the most perfect girl ever, she didn't really have any character progression ngl i mean she was kinda already portrayed as like the perfect girl who was great at sniping and everything since the first part :) that's my girl hehe but i think they could've elaborate a little more about her sniping skills (could she have had a past experience that resulted in her skills? i think her backstory was worth the elaboration) the love triangle with kimchi and sucheol hmmm (i pick kimchi tho sucheol also seems nice) it was a cute attempt to make the show a little less action and violence packed by including some romance in it (made it a bit more bearable for those that do not enjoy action thrillers) &gt;!In part 2, they killed sucheol off (i think they were just trying to make it easier to push nara and kimchi tgt) not a great move though.. sucheol was a decent man (watching them gain courage to fight for a girl they liked would've been interesting but i understand it's not the most suitable for a action thriller like this) also at the end where everyone freaking died (NO WAY I THINK THE WRITERS WERE HIGH WHEN WRITING THE SCRIPT) they kinda didn't show what happened to those 4 who survived (like it was literally just kimchi taking the CSAT) i mean if they wanted to end it off after killing like 90% of the damn kids, at least show the post war life of the 10% you didn't kill of in your damn script sheesh.. ( it probably would've made the ending way better (considering it's already on my number 1 ranking of worst endings ever)!&lt;\n2. kwon il ha - i think he had qute a bit of character progression. He was quite the asshole in the first part and i really hated his character (like how he always picked on kimchi) but i always thought the fiercest nastiest character probably always had a sad backstory and a soft heart (i guess his backstory could've been elaborated slightly as well, but maybe 10 episodes wasn't enough for character backstories) he became way better and nicer in part 2 (probably because they matured) &gt;!In part 2, I would say his character was not that prominent other than the last 2 episodes where he was 1 of the 4 that rigged the votes and everything to keep his friends here (they had a reason for it but they could've done it in a different way) i think it was smart of the writers to add this scene in because it's so realistic, betrayal is very common in real life and I really liked how their reactions to this was very real and natural (like how we would react in real life) SMART MOVE i really liked this scene. Moving on, him saving so yeon was really touching (he was really brave for that and i genuinely cried because he died saving her) he didn't deserve it and his death is so unjustified ugh. His death was so uncalled for and I think it was the most terrible scene ever, there's so many gaps in how he died like how did yeong soo kill him off and dragged him to the water and drown him and apparently even tied stones to him to keep his body down all in that few minutes before the rest came (they were literally in the same location the most it took for them to arrive was prob 2-3 minutes lol) and ya in such a scary and traumatising moment, how would yeong soo be able to process everything and even tie rocks to him to make sure his body sinks (i would probably have a whole mental breakdown and just sit there shocked because i just freaking killed my classmate like wth) this scene do be kinda unecessary and feels kinda forced like prob the writers just wanted to kill someone off man... \\[PLOT HOLE 2\\]!&lt;\n3. do soo cheol - character progression from part 1 to part 2? nah idts i guess cause he wasn't one of the main characters lol but yeppp.. him and nara were kinda cute ngl &gt;!ok knowing that he was 1 of the 4 that rigged and votes and everything was kinda expected (i guess he seemed like the kind who wouldt do such a thing not that it's bad lol) his death though that was FREAKING SAD i cried... like man didn't deserve it but i think his death was really important because it started all the conflicts. From his death, they found the rigged votes which sparked an argument which led to more revelations like the broken radio etc. !&lt;\n4. guk yeong soo - dude is just obsessed with studying and CSAT from the start to the end like ugh give us a break i have to say i freaking hate his character (somehow just pisses me off &gt;!(especially because of what happened in part 2) !&lt;his obsession became a little too much.. it just became really unrealistic in such a situation i guess. well i would say character progression was HUGE.. &gt;!like bro just went from a mugger to a pervert that sexually assaults soyeon and then a pyscho that started a whole ass school shooting and killing off 90% of the damn kids and ends up dying too (the dumbest plot and character progression ever) but i guess what the writers did good about his character was explaining the backstory (about how he was poor and he could not afford tuition like the others which explain his obsession with studying and CSAT) !&lt;\n5. yeon bo ra - i freaking love her like ugh she's so girl crush and her character progression is just SLAYYY.. part 1 her was kinda cold (typical bully vibes) but you could tell she actually has a soft heart inside.. she cares about everyone &gt;!(especially no ae sol)!&lt; but she doesn't  know how to express herself.. &gt;!it was great that she was able to express her concerns a little more in part 2 though she was still kinda cold HAHA the scene where she said that ae sol wasn't their friend really hurt (but we knew she only said that to protect ae sol) but she immediately scream for them to stop when they started assaulting ae sol (i teared up.. tho she's cold towards ae sol she really cares) honestly her and ae sol's relationship was one of the most precious thing throughout this drama. and her getting hurt while trying to save ae sol and ae sol clumsily treating her wound is just the cutest thing ever (i wouldn't mind if this show ended up being a GL lol) also i love her new hairstyle.. she's so hot in that hairstyle girl is slaying!&lt;\n6. no ae sol - the clumsiest dumbest slowest character in part 1.. everyone kinda hated her lol (i would too) character progression was there but it was just slightly (not to overwhelming) &gt;!part 2 ae sol was much better at shooting (makes sense considering they all improved, it would've been annoying if she was still as clumsy cause she could possibly accidentally kill any of them with that clumsy hands of hers) like i said before, her and bora's relationship is probably the most precious thing in this drama !&lt;",

HAHHA they were just annoying and being so extra. they were extremely childish and annoying in their own ways and would definitely be better off gone or dead (they constant whining and bickering just annoys me so much)\n\nOVERALL.. i think the first half was definitely great.. the second part not so much because of the ending but I would still recc this drama for those who like action thrillers because it's actually worth the watch other than the ending (so if you're gonna watch just prepare yourself for the ending &gt;!where everyone just gets killed by a psycho)!&lt;",

Irl, all the good people including those with character development really die unjustly everyday. But in terms of drama writing, the show failed miserably.\n\nI get how the writers are using this drama as a social commentary. In order to make their points across, they have to make it a tragedy. However, they forgot one big thing. We, as viewers, will only sympathize with their advocacy if they made their villain someone we empathized with. &gt;!From the get-go, Yeong Soo was written as annoying as hell and failed to show his side of the story- how there were personal wars people were going through that were twice as worse than the spheres. !&lt;\n\nI also wasn\u2019t sure on the drama\u2019s message at the end. I thought the writers want to show that adults were dangling the exams over the kids\u2019 heads and driving them to their deaths. &gt;!But in the end, the adults were nowhere to be found and didn\u2019t own up to their mistakes. I thought they were going to expound on the anecdote that guns shouldn\u2019t have been placed on children\u2019s hands in the first place. But no, in the end, the message was simply to help each other. !&lt;\n\nThere were also a lot of interesting takes that the show could have delved in, like how a couple of students were clearly experiencing ptsd.\n\nOn a more positive note, there were still a lot of points wherein the drama shined. One was the ost. Another was the acting- everyone was acting their asses off and it translated well on the screen. I have never watched a show wherein I\u2019m rooting for at least 5 ships to sail.\n\nI just know that my Duty After School kdrama ended in the amusement park. They released a weapon at the same time, killed off the spheres and lived happily ever after.",

It's not like I think the performances are bad, it's not even like I think there are some interesting characters... but the actual plot and pacing is all over the place. The actual thought and way certain things are represented makes no sense at time. It's completely illogical at many points.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But hey you get to the end of it and then you have this absolute gut punch of a conclusion which I don't even think serves a purpose. Like if the whole point was to somehow show the CSAT obsessed culture was ridiculous then they really dropped the ball with the ending IMO.!&lt;",

I kind of prepared myself for all of them to die but the way it was down was brutal and chilling and not to mention half assed.

            "comment": "So I binge-watched all 10 episodes of Duty After School and after knowing that the ending got much hate, I read the original webtoon right after. I personally enjoyed both the series and the comic and have varying thoughts on them.\n\nThe webtoon is fast-paced and has a more laidback tone to it because of the jokes. The series, however, is focused more on the students' emotional state and their relationship with one another (and to their platoon leader).\n\nIn both mediums, the story revolves around two realistic concepts that South Koreans are facing: 1.) the rigorous education system represented by the CSAT, and 2.) the looming threat of war given off the people on the North symbolized by the cells/spheres.\n\n\"What about the large cell/sphere?\" - They are just there since they represent NK. Looming in the sky waiting to again invade and bring destruction in the future.\n\n\"Human is more dangerous than the creatures\" - I really dislike this concept in Part 2 because the spheres already represents their wartime enemies. Differentiating between what is a human and what is a creature dissolves that representation.\n\n\"Forget about episodes 7-10\" - Even though Part 2 is slow, I kinda like it as these episodes added depth to the characters especially in their internal conflict. I understand why most of the people don't like it but I have watched much worse than this.\n\n\"Part 2 feels rushed\" - Not really. Though we could have gotten some info on the state of the country here and then. I wanted more action scenes like in Part 1.\n\n\"Ending sucks\" - True. IMO, it's because they &gt;!killed too many characters right at the end. They added depth and personality to the characters only to be poured down the drain. I liked the bold move though yet it made no sense for one kid to kill off 10 others just like that. It's beyond me how nobody was able to get a critical shot on him for so long.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I recommend the series. The main concepts mirror that of real life situations in Korea. Part 1 is so good in terms of action scenes and production. Part 2 is slow but it adds depth to the group as a whole and ending could have been better. Note that most of the characters' decisions are dumb asf.",

            "comment": "Does anyone have any kind of theory for the following scenes? Maybe I've been looking into it too much, but there's no shot they wouldn't have framed it this way: &gt;!In the last scene, before almost everyone falls victim to Yeong-Soo, Chi-Yeol is dreaming about an alternate reality before the war started and everyone who passed away is still alive. His mind is jogged by Na-Ra's voice only to find that she's nowhere in the class room, then he wakes up to reality where most of his classmates have perished. My big question is, why was Na Ra not in the classroom with the rest of them? All of the 'survivors' are in that scene, just not Na-Ra. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Na-Ra, even in the webtoon, has been a highly enigmatic character that I can't understand at all. Perhaps there is a reason she was made to be a \"perfect soldier,\" and portrayed to be a \"loyal/good friend,\" and also someone who is just super quiet and pondering all the time. Like, what could she mean to the author? Also, something I noticed was that she tells Chi-Yeol to wake up like literally four times. While she's doing this, Yeong-Soo is outside the classroom going after Bo-ra and Ae-sol.!&lt;\n\nHere are also some other dissonances I've noticed: &gt;!At the beginning of the fourth episode, where it shows Chi-yeol laying on the ground surrounded by his dead friends, Duk-Joong is not on top of him like what happened later. He's just laying on the ground, with his eyes slowly brimming to consciousness. Like what's up with that? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In Jong-soo's 'first death', he is shown to be killed by a sphere instead of being shot by Yeong-Soo. In this version, everyone returns fire right away whereas in the Yeong-Soo version everyone stands there for a good 10-12 seconds before taking up arms.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!We see two \"sphere-detector\" scenes before Yeong-Soo's rampage. One at the beach and one with Yeong-soo just outside the classroom. Now this one made more sense to me. Spheres coming from the beach after responding to gunshots was a logical occurrence. Whereas, Yeong-soo detecting the spheres outside the classroom was more metaphorical. It represented that he did not know how to differentiate between humans and spheres, solidifying his madness, and him going on a genocide. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!What is the 'reality' and the 'dream'? There has to be some purpose that the writer's had been following around Chi-yeol, right? And made him the record keeper.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!What do the last four survivors mean? In the manhwa, the author doesn't kill off everyone. And I'm sure the writers had full knowledge of this when they decided to kill off 90% of the class. That's why I'm of the mind that the four survivors had been hand-picked for some reason (unless bad writing lol). How do the last four survive? Chi-yeol gets saved by Duk-Joong, Na-ra gets saved by Ae-sol (who gets saved by Bo-ra), Ha-na runs away. Like this has boggled my mind since they killed the lieutenant off in the first season, and I sat down to think about it: they killed off the only responsible adult in the series. Perhaps they were trying to show that responsible adults come and go? IDK lol. So many questions for me.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!In regards to Won Bin, I found it annoying that they had little to no mention of him in part 2. I have a little theory, though. With the only responsible adult gone, it's like he was never there. The writers deliberately took him out because they wanted to show that adults are quick to abandon their responsibilities, just like that one high school's commander in part 1. However, they did him real dirty though. I felt that, in part 1, he cared about class 3-2. Also, where the hell is the students of that one high school? No one showed or mentioned how they died lol... I guess they fell victim to the good old plot hole.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!For showing us the paper stamping class 3-2's status report after the incident, saying how only 'four students survived,' and not mentioning their names specifically, was probably shown on purpose. It's to portray how, in the greater theme of the war, and to those in powers' eyes, those kids were naught but numbers on a piece of paper; disposable pawns in a pointless war.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The kids survived outside of the classroom for months, only to be killed inside of it. In their same old seats pretty much. !&lt;",

But it's also unrealistic how accurate Young Soo's shots were that he could easily kill of like 90% of his classmates using just a few mags considering that at that point he's mentally unstable and irrational. And also how did his classmates be able to shoot fast moving spheres but couldn't shoot him in time and accurately. In my opinion, it would have been more realistic if it followed the webtoon were lesser classmates died.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!And also another huge plot hole regarding where Won Bin is... mans just disappeared right after the explosion and he was one of my favourite characters...!&lt;\n\nThe first part of the series was enjoyable and I could particularly relate to the struggles of Ae Seol as I struggled to adapt to military life as well (and i still am). But the second part of the series made me think that the writers just decided to just call it quits and scrapped up a shitty ending just to end the series. I had hopes for this drama but I ended up getting disappointed by that ending",

Love that it wasn\u2019t a stereotypical happy ending where their entire families are alive somehow.\n\nIt also showed how harmful stipulations surrounding education really are.

I have seen so many movies and shows that there is nothing that can surprise me anymore, but this\u2026 this truly left me shocked. I liked the mixed feelings it left in me. Also the ending wasn\u2019t pointless and their deaths weren\u2019t \u201cunnecessary\u201d. At least not for me. They spent their time fighting spheres. They were the biggest enemy for them, however\u2026 in the last few episodes you have to be blind to not see how the biggest cause of the problems were humans, not spheres. They expected that spheres would kill them, but they never thought that a human, especially someone from their class, would betray them like this and be the reason for their deaths. And that boy going insane over CSAT is not unrealistic. He is traumatised by the life him and his parents had to live. He mentioned that he will study at night with headphones in while his parents are groaning from the pain because of their hard work. They are poor. In poverty. The only way he can change his life and make it easier for both himself and his hardworking parents is by studying hard and going into the best university. He has been doing this his whole life. This is what he sees when you mention \u201cliving\u201d or \u201cdaily life\u201d. It\u2019s studying. He can\u2019t accept the fact that CSAT \u201cisn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\nHowever\u2026 he was right. It DID happen and if he didn\u2019t lose it so early and waited a bit, he would\u2019ve had the life he so hardly worked for. He would achieve the thing he fought for. Sadly, the painful and dangerous reality made him go insane. How exactly? It started by getting the shocking news. How would you react if someone gives you such shattering news? Finding out you lost something you fought for all your life. It\u2019s all gone now. He was so shocked that his sanity started to slip away. He has also liked Bo-ra for a while now and thanks to him being vulnerable and mentally unstable, seeing her with another guy pushed his buttons even more. Thanks to him being unstable at the moment, he committed a m*rder because he didn\u2019t want others to understand what he had previously done. One mistake after another, he fell even deeper into the hole. And finally\u2026 he had no sanity left. Full of rage and hatred, he k!lled everyone just like his biggest reason to live was k!lled. I think it all makes sense, you just have to look into it a bit more. \nAnd of course\u2026 it\u2019s a drama after all. You can\u2019t always expect a happy ending. It\u2019s not thrilling. At least not for me. It\u2019s good, but.. it\u2019s nothing that big. It\u2019s not shocking enough to be left in my mind. But I will remember this show and get reminded of it constantly. It\u2019s just different than what I usually see.",

They see their friends as rivals and it's very rare for them to help each other. They are blaming the adults for sending them to war. This stands for tha parents who are pressuring their children to study hard and get into a good college. In Korea, the ultimate goal of almost all of the students is to get into a good college in Seoul. That's why most of the spheres were in Seoul. That's the center of war. The obsession relating to CSAT was exaggerrated but it just showed the mindset of Korean students. For them, whether they are sick or hurt or burnt out, the only thing on their minds is studying. What stuck with me was what one student said at the end. If it were that easy to end the war, why did they ask us to fight it then? Really makes you think....",

                    "comment": "&gt;!To begin with, in the webtoon they never drift apart from the soldiers, and Chunho didn't die. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- The way Youngsoo covered up Ilha's murder makes more sense. The whole scene of Youngsoo, Soyeon and Ilha happens in mid of a mission when they get separated as they 're running away of a mid-cell that divided into a lot of small cells. Soyeon is unconscious because a cell exploded close to her. Youngsoo sexually assaults her and Ilha sees them. Youngsoo threatens to kill Ilha if he tells anyone about what he saw. Ilha says he will not say anything, which Youngsoo believes at first because he had already killed a student before and Ilha didn't say anything after he threated him. Ilha caughts him off guard and punches him while trying to grab a gun, but Youngsoo also grabs a gun, then only a bang is heard. Later is revealed that it was Youngsoo the one who survived, and that after shooting Ilha, he destroyed his head using a big rock, woke soyeon up and went back to the camp. He tells everyone that a cell exploded near Ilha and that's what killed him. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- Youngsoo's mental state decline has A LOT of more development in the Webtoon. From the start, it is left clear that he has anger issues and a resentment towards Ilha. When they are learning how to shoot, he points at Ilha with a gun during the practice and Ilha sees it. Ilha confronts him about it later, but Youngsoo denies it (Ilha believes it since he had been having hallucinations after Younghoo's death due to guilt.), but later expresses how he was indeed pointing at him and wanted to kill him. After accidentally killing a student during a mission, he refuses to tell the truth even though it was an accident because he fears he will be seen as a murderer like it happened to Ilha when he accidentally killed Younghoon (which he also uses to manipulate Ilha into not telling the truth) and he lies about the student's death with no problem, getting away with it. After Ilha's death, he's left in a really poor mental state, he starts trying to justify killing him (\"if i didn't shot him, he would've shot me\" \"he was a bully, the world is better without people like him\" \"he bullied me for years, i'm the victim\") and also starts blaming Soyeon for what happened. His guilt increases when Taeman receives a letter from Ilha's mom asking to please be careful and to stay healthy, which leads it to Taeman and Hwirak (who were the closest to kwon) to make more questions about his death. This stresses Youngsoo more as he grews fearful they will find out about the truth. One of the soldiers tells them they found Ilha's body and took pictures of it as evidence, Youngsoo gets extremely anxious because he's not sure if the bullet mark was visible or not, and becomes even more paranoid of everyone finding out. He has hallucinations where he kills his classmates and teacher, while blaming everything on Soyeon. On the end, he's finally gone insane and realizes that he was never close to his classmates to begin with and that's why he shoots them. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- In the Webtoon, Youngsoo only kills like 3-4 characters (which most of them do not exist on the drama, I think the only character that was in the drama that died in that scene was Jangsoo) and then he gets shot by Nara!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- Their english teacher, who was accompanying them, tells them they have to cover up the deaths because the group could get disbanded and they would lose all their extra points. Everyone is terrified and ask why do he cares about extra points at that moment. The teacher finally confesses if it's discovered that they were killed by a bandmate, and not a cell, then their deaths would be brushed as \"incidents of war\" and would be left behind and treated with less honor and respect than the deaths of the rest of students. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- The whole Youngsoo incident happens on their last day of training, which makes everything more painful. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- In the end we're shown what happened after training finised. We see Chiyeol reuniting with his parents, the funeral of the students and a sneak into their lives a year after. All of them talk about how nothing returned to the same when it came to the class atmosphere, Bora explicity talks about how everyone is depressed and traumatized, but society expects them to act like nothing happened. Soyeon talks about missing and dreaming with Jangsoo, other students talk about how they got used to seeing cells in the sky, etc. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!There are way more differences, but this are the ones I remember from the top of my head. !&lt;",

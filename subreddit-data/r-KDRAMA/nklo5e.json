I used my nail art brush and dotting tools and thankfully I had a nail stamping plate of the butterfly wings and I used blue and black polish to make the gradient. I also stamped the flower and colored it in with the pink polish using my brush. For the gradient background I used a makeup sponge to make a gradient of the blue pink and violet colors.",

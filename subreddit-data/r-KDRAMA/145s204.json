This explains the multiple closeup shots of the sparkly bracelet ML was wearing! And not gonna lie, those close up shots made me feel a twinge of desire to purchase something equally sparkly though I'm not a bracelet person at all. It's lucky that my wheel for PPL landed on jewelry so this worked out great!",

Do they keep the sets really cold on purpose? I noticed in Reply 1988 you saw their breath a lot when they were talking, even inside. It wasn\u2019t clear to me if that was a subtle commentary on the expense of heating or if sets are really kept that cold.",

There was a drama I watched recently where you could clearly see they were sweating like crazy, but still had at least two layers of clothing. It really surprised me because I'd never seen actors walking around with wet patches in their clothes (not unless it was done on purpose for plot or context reasons). \n\nA weird case for me was The Forbidden Marriage, because during the first episodes all of their faces were super shiny and their hairlines wet, like they kept sweating because it was very hot, but in latter chapters you could see their breath in the air.\n\nAll of this to say, I'm sure the wardrobe and make up teams must have to work super hard and actors must often melt or freeze their butts off.",

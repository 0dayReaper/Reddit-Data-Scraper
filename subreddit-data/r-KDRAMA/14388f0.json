His role could've easily become caricaturish but he didn't. Since some are speculating that he did so many dramas back-to-back he may be enlisting. Even if that's not the case I just hope his next drama is a fun rom-com with a role where he doesn't have to shed buckets of tears but just be his own goofy self with a golden retriever energy. \n\nPlus I'm hoping the drama ends on a happier note.

I\u2019ve never studied law but even I know that 90% of it was irrelevant to the original charges. The double witnesses? Crazy \n\n- I found it unbelievable that Kang Ho had such a loving relationship with his mom toward the end. I never really got past the abuse part in the beginning. \n\n- Won\u2019t comment on Ye Jin and Seo Jin because we are all collectively saying the same thing lol!\n\n- I loved how Kang Ho proposed to Mijoo at the end. It was so cute and unexpected. \n\nOverall I\u2019m happy with the finale. I do think it was rushed but I\u2019m glad they tried to close all the major plot holes and give everyone a happy ending.

All of the hospital and escape scenes were immaculate.

Kang-ho and Mijoo kissing!&lt; but it was so worth it cause I was giggling at the way Kang-ho threw away his bag and &gt;!kiss Mijoo.!&lt;\n\nThe prosecution part was a mess cause it was all so dramatic and less believable but I really didn't mind cause we were able to see more of our Jouri ppl. I don't understand why many complain about the eps not being enough. I think it's perfect cause 2 more eps would've been such a drag.\n\nAround ep 10 I had said that I don't mind an open ending with Kang-ho's mom being alive and I don't want a &gt;!funeral!&lt;. Guess what we ended up having? Exactly that! Maybe I was asking too much. But it was a very lovely&gt;!funeral cause when Kang-ho was still singing for his mom I was already tearing up but when he started crying exactly like his mom taught him I really couldn't.!&lt; It was very cliche to see her &gt;!breathe her last like that!&lt; but it was okay with me since you could see the satisfaction on her face.\n\nMy heart was so happy and full to see Kang-ho and Mijoo being such an adorable couple again. Them and the twins will make me die of happiness lol. We didn't get a wedding but it was a very sweet throwback to Kang-ho's mom's proposal. I'd gladly take that. Also Eun-jin looked so beautiful in that dress. She had such a good chemistry with Lee Do-hyun and I'd even say his best chemistry. Theirs is such a complete love story.\n\nI'm so glad I watched this series despite being in a slump. It was a great 7 weeks with these great characters. I'll definitely miss this cast and special shout-out to the twins. They're definitely the stars of the show",

So is Kang Mal-geum as Mi-joo's mom. Good actors just bringing it.\n\nIf Village Chief's wife doesn't take her mask off in the final episode, I am going to riot in the streets. Just kidding, it will be mildly disappointing.\n\nI loved this show. I'm sad it's over soon. But it was great.\n\n(My theory is that Hwang Su-hyeon, when she jumped in the water, was not actually holding her baby. Just the blanket.)",

I had held out hope that &gt;!Hwang Soo-hyun and her baby were somehow still alive!&lt;.\n* What made the hospital sequence especially hilarious was Sam-sik, in that ridiculous \"disguise\", trying to take the lead, when Mi-joo is one of the smartest, toughest characters in this drama.\n* \"When someone acts out of the ordinary, it means they'll die soon.\" That was a reality check we didn't need. Close-knit communities in dramas like this make situations like Young-soon's all the more painful.\n* The &gt;!breakout scene!&lt; at the hospital was perfect. Mi-joo and Ha-young calmly and rationally laid out their positions on the matter, the \"hypervolemic shock\" trick worked a treat, and everyone's favorite soundtrack song kicked in as the quartet made their escape.\n* The gangsters to whom Sam-sik owed money are an absolute delight when they break into song (dare I say, they are the *only* musicians who I'm a fan of in this drama.) The sight of Sam-sik clutching Kang-ho's leg as he cut those gangsters down to size was another moment of comedy gold.\n* \"The person you love is... Lee Mi-joo, right? \"Come back and live with us for the rest of your life, okay?\" Those words, along with a kiss with literal fireworks in the background, were like music to my ears.\n* You don't see a henchmen vs. excavator fight scene in every drama.",

            "comment": "tbh i have a hard time enjoying the slice of life genre (idk why i just do i think it has to do with some unrealistic touches that get flung in here and there) but i really enjoyed this drama. it had some really relatable parts to it that just struck really hard, especially with the parenting / mother-child dynamics between kang ho and the mom. while it did boil down to a what some might consider as a somewhat anti-climatic 10 minute trial, I thought it was actually well done and didn't feel like the show ever dragged. on top of all that, they had a top notch cast who were all wonderful and really made the show great- particularly the twins haha. ra miran is a wonderful actress and i'm glad we got to see more of ahn eunjin. also lee do hyun (and kim won hae) seem to have a really good sense of picking scripts/dramas because all the dramas they are in are really good.\n\nand a little off topic but the actor playing so ji suk aka the older lettuce farmer has such mesmerizing eyes- like the eye colour is so beautiful???",

It got even funnier when Samshik took &gt;!Kang-ho and the gang to the gangster's den and sat like a puppy hugging Kang-ho's legs.!&lt; I hope the two get along now haha.\n\nFinally we had a passionate  &gt;!kiss from our Kang-ho and Mijoo!&lt; and now I shall rest. I want that &gt;!kiss scene!&lt; injected into my veins cause it was so angsty and also my girl Mijoo directly asked Kang-ho&gt;!\"Is my lips far from my forehead? Why won't you kiss the lips?\"!&lt; Go, Mijoo! And she is very much THAT girl cause I got goosebumps when she threatened &gt;!Ha-young that she'd kill her if something happens to Kang-ho.!&lt; God I love protective girlfriends so much and Kang-ho and Mijoo are really the \"Touch my partner and I'll kill you\" couple which is my fav trope ever.\n\nI cried again with the villagers scene &gt;!when everyone gets to know that Young-soon is dying!&lt; but it brought them closer and I loved it.\n\nIn the finale I hope we get done with the revenge and have Kang-ho bonding with the villagers, not as a sad and brooding prosecutor but as a happy and content man. Also I can't wait for Yejin to find out that her mom stole Kang-ho oppa away from her lol.",

            "comment": "**Episode 14**\n\n* The final episode swung for the fences from the outset, with Kang-ho laying down an ultimatum to Tae-soo, then making a grand entrance to execute the plan to catch Woo-byeok in the act of attempting to push his beloved assistant over the edge of the rooftop.\n* Kang-ho made another grand entrance in prosecutor robes, coupled with Young-soon's heartfelt narration. The theme of \"justice for Hae-sik\" might have seemed like a cliched way to frame the trial, but who could resist Young-soon's strength of character in the face of her illness?\n* The ebbs and flows of the trial were brilliantly portrayed. One moment, there was a lingering fear that Tae-soo could try to cover for Woo-byeok. The next moment, we wanted him to expose Woo-byeok, together with Ha-yeong. A moment later, we were disgusted with him for abandoning her. Then, boom... enter &gt;!Hwang Soo-hyun's child!&lt; to take both of them down.\n* \"Since Mr. Sam-sik never works, he can serve the food today.\" \"In other words, he's jobless.\" How I'll miss the twins. \"We hated the stinky pig smell and protested your move.\" I'll miss the village chief's wife too. Mi-joo's grandmother's words in that flashback were especially moving.\n* I liked how they tried to find the positives in &gt;!Young-soon's passing!&lt;, with her favorite song serving as a recurring motif. &gt;!Sam-sik and Ha-young!&lt; definitely felt like a stretch, but the unveiling of &gt;!the village chief's wife as a pregnant Yakuza member!&lt; was well worth the wait.\n* Young-soon's &gt;!final letter!&lt; to Kang-ho, his nod to his father's proposal by releasing the pig in Mi-joo's direction, and Lee Moon Sae's \"Talk About Love\" playing over the end credits brought this wonderful series to a satisfying conclusion.",

The fact that the bad guys did a poorly job on trying to kill Kang-Ho making dumb errors. I did not feel he was in any actual danger with exception of the crash.\n3. The fact that when Young-Soon had that nightmare, she said to Woo-Byeok :\"He doesn't know what went on between us\" (Although could be a translation issue?!) WB:\"And what exactly was that?\" Could have been interpreted as if YS had something with WB the past? It would have been ironic and interesting if they went that route.\n4.Kang-Ho and Ha-Young's relationship, regardless of what she eventually did to Kang-Ho (I don't condone it but it was out of pure manipulation from her dad) he played her really bad for years, he used her physically and emotionally. That's messed up!\n5. The fact that Kang-Ho commited many crimes in the name of his revenge (Witheld key evidence which damaged innocent people, manipulated processes, abetted illegal immigration, took bribes, etc) and besides losing his job, he did not suffer any other consequence. Even the investigator told him off.\n6.The punishment to the bad guys felt rushed, squeezed into the final minutes and it was pure kangaroo court.\nAnd 7. What happened to Lion?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still liked this and will miss seeing the piggy roaming the village \ud83d\udc16\ud83d\udc16\ud83d\udc16\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc37",

And since the composer guy is utterly irrelevant to the plot, I wish writers could use his time to explore the bromance btwn Samsik and Kangho, dat would be really fun. \n\nAnd lastly, Choi Teak\u2019s father will forever be Choi Teak\u2019s father.",

            "comment": "This show will always be special to me because it was the first drama I watched with my future mother-in-law \ud83d\ude02 There is a language barrier between us so it was nice to connect through this show. I found a lot of comfort in Mi Joo's character and the twins. Because of this show, I could also zoom out and think about what love means and how, in an ideal future world, harm and abuse will have no place in it.\n\nMy anger and energy towards systemic injustice and abuse, outside of my day job and drama/anime escapism, has been directed to organizing, advocacy and activism work in my communities. But since it takes a lot of emotional energy and time, I protect my energy by balancing rest and taking my (kdrama) pleasures seriously. Which often comes with me relating to what I want to see, trying to have a healthy detachment, and appreciating the journey.  \n\n\nThat's one of the reasons I enjoy Korean dramas and productions-- they often tackle systemic injustice and social issues that resonate with people globally. **Without idealizing it since there is always nuance, I also appreciate the depiction of community and collectivism in non-Western cultures**\\-- something I thought I lost when my family uprooted from my motherland when I was young. I envied friends who were surrounded by trusted and caring aunts and uncles &amp; family friends- their own Jouri village, but maybe less chaotic and fantastical \ud83d\ude02  \n\n\nI recently read an article criticizing the show's use of disability as a plot device for the mother's redemption, a second chance for her as a bad mother to raise and build a better relationship with her son. It talks about ableism and how disability is represented in media, how even shows with good intentions still fall short of adequately representing disability by infantilizing it.  \n\n\nI thought that LDH's acting made sense (and praised it) because his character lost his memories and had the mind of a 7 year-old. But I did think it was hurtful and wrong when people, including his mom, called him an \"idiot.\" **I have much more to learn about disability justice and ableism.** While I didn't think that was the focus of the show, I thought it was an interesting critique of the writing.  \n\n\nIf some of the members of this community had not said it, I might not have reflected on how (1) Kang Ho's journal entries and desire to avenge the death of his father and resulting transformation of his mom, and (2) his mom's terminal illness, were written to balance out, maybe alleviate, the mother's treatment of Kang Ho pre-/post- amnesia and paralysis. And how Kang Ho abandoned Mi Joo and used Ha Young. I stand by what I've said before and am okay with the way the story unfolded. Nevertheless, it helps to look at stories from a different lens.  \n\n\nOnce in a while, I am curious about fan fiction written about a show. I think the only fanfiction I would read about this show would be about **Kang Ho and Mi Joo's life at Happy Farm with their kids and Jouri family.** And maybe an alternative story where Young Soon doesn't die.  \n\n\nSide note: ***It would be fun to try a social simulation video game like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley with \"maps\" simulating some of our favorite seaside towns and country villages \ud83e\udd6c\ud83d\ude0a***  \n\n\nOn a final note, **I love it when shows teach me reasons to love animals that I didn't know before- in this case, it's that pigs are good mothers, intelligent and social beings, and are clean animals.**\n\nThanks, all, for the interesting discussions. Take care!",

            "comment": "This was the first time discussing an on-air drama and I truly enjoyed watching and hearing everyone's opinion. \n\nI see all of us universally agree about the stupidity of the trial \ud83d\ude02. Regardless of how non-sensical the courtroom scene was, I was still moved by the completion of the emotional arc and that mother and son were able to put closure to the one event that had defined their lives.\n\nThings I would have liked the show explored more:\n\n1. Choi Kang-Ho : In the penultimate episode the investigator tells CKH is that he doesn't know who he is, whether he is good or bad, woobeyok's ally or enemy. And CKH tells him that he'll take the opportunity to show him now who he was. But, I feel like we don't more about him. Who was he outside of this revenge? Did he like the pig farm enough to leave the legal service? Was it in memory of his mother? After witnessing how power runs the world, did he agree with his mother's actions? Maybe it's the LDH fan in me who just wants more of him lol. One day I want to see LDH as a truly morally grey character dealing with his own dilemmas.\n\n2. Motherhood: It was quite conservative in this regard and shied away from uncomfortable topics such as the real emotional ramifications of such a childhood. YoungSoon does come to some understanding about it. But from CKH side, I felt it just pushed it under the rug of 'it was all an act to take revenge'. The lengths to which he was willing to go for this revenge including betraying his love and almost marrying a woman to reach her father, that's... a lot. I mean the possibilities are endless and yet they took the most easiest route out there and tied everything up so easily. It wasn't unsatisfying but they could have done more. You don't even need more time, just the right dialogues.\n\n3. Mi-Joo: After what he did, he should he begging Mi-joo to marry her, he should be doing grand gestures, he should be winning her over all over again. C'mon writers she deserved better!",

            "comment": "This cast deserved a better final episode. My immersion was ruined during the trial. I know it's fiction and ridiculous stuff happens but the whole combination with the double witness hearing sitting at the same table and the baddies getting convicted without much resistance just minutes later was just too much for me. These two characters are damn powerful but they somehow have the shittiest legal defense the moment they were confronted with all things THEY WERE ACTUALLY AWARE OF? It felt like the writer didn't see any value in the crime plot herself and just wanted to get it done. The final scenes were better but man, what a mess in the end. Crazy skipping, weird pacing, mom gets the goodbye speech during dinner, mom dies while listening to a sweet lullaby, few minutes later she gets another moment to \"talk\" to her son with that letter. No stakes or finality in any action, the viewer doesn't even get a chance to digest anything in the end. Maybe we have a deleted scene where the grilled pork belly talks in Young-soon's voice too. It felt so rushed and crammed.\n\n\nThis might sound harsher than it maybe should be, just my immediate thoughts after finishing the drama. Shades of greatness throughout the show (the dynamic between Kang-ho and Mi-joo during the phase where he had no memory) but the final episode, amateur hour. And I am still not sure about the purpose of that music producer.",

But I'll let it pass since it never was my focus anyway.\n\nI laughed so hard when Samsik saw the CCTV recording of the kiss, and when he told his mother that he knew about Kangho-Mijoo because he saw it. lmao.\n\nAt the birthday party, Youngsoon started her speech like a Reddit comment: \"People might say I'm the most unfortunate woman\" (continuing to list all her misfortunes). But when she started talking about things she's learned to value, I cried. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe funeral... \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I already forgot she taught him about it. Her letter is another scene that made me bawl my eyes out. \"I'm sorry that I wasn't good enough.\"\n\nHappy ending for all the couples! My favorite is the prison couple (this sounds weird lol) and the gangster turned farmer. I remember comments in an earlier thread hoping they would end up living in the village. Manse!\n\nThe makeup and hair of the yaguza masked lady. Loved it.\n\nKudos to all the hardworking people behind this drama. It made me laugh, cry, pull my hair out\u2014everything all at once. The writing is not perfect, but it's better than most. The topic of mother and son relationships is refreshing to see. It got me thinking and feeling a lot. The directing is great, and the acting is perfect all around! Ahn Eunjin might be my favorite actress from Hospital Playlist post-HP. It's my first time watching Ra Miran, and I can see she's legendary. Lee Dohyun has range. The twins!! If you love Yejin, I would recommend watching her in Our Blues.

Just plain wonderful! \n\nThat said, I feel the writing was at times was lazy, and the pacing was wrong. \n\nTo me the relationship between MI-joo, Kang-ho and the twins were brushed off, to put it mildly. I would\u2019ve been okay with it if the built up for MJ and KH (and especially the secret of the twins) wasn\u2019t portrayed as big. It feels like the reveal was more for YS than KH that is actually their father\u2026 and the writing? Was lazy. The writers couldn\u2019t bother to deal with the reveal of who the father of the twins was, so it skipped to them already knowing. We weren\u2019t shown their reactions.\n\nWould it be too messy? Were they not interested in this couple and the twins as much? Again, I would\u2019ve been okay with things rolling this way if the built up wasn\u2019t as big. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but KH seemed like he needed to be guided to marry MJ. He never really took the initiative. She seemed to want it more than he did. After everything that went down, all the things unresolved and unsaid between them, I wasn\u2019t okay with it.\n\nIt was just as lazy for MJ to say she\u2019d always go back running to KH because her mother endured her own husband. And at the end she thanked her mother for putting up with him, because she was given a father. An abusive, cheating, irresponsible and money wasting man. How is it possible that MJ\u2019s daughter is more mature than all of them? She just wanted her mom happy, that was good enough for her. It pains me that the writers did such a thing. It was just too lazy and easier than addressing the pain of her father being abusive and negligent. More complex, too. So, they brushed it off. \n\nThe last few episodes were like this. Quick and dismissive of relationships for the revenge plot to be completed. \n\nI wasn\u2019t convinced of what kind of father he\u2019d make for his kids. Nor that he wanted MJ as much as she did him (she made most sacrifices and compromises). What we got was closure with the revenge plot and his mother having finally a good relationship with him. \n\nIt was amazing on the things the writers focused on, and unsatisfactory on the things they decided to brush off.\n\nOverall, it was emotional and really worthwhile but if I watch again, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m not going to except as much for the love story. I\u2019ll just focus on the amazing acting and the revenge plot. \n\nPS. I know I\u2019ll get downvoted to hell, but there it is.",

    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules.

I watched it before I became a mother, and now that I'm a new mom to a 4 month old, I keep thinking back to one of the first scenes with the FL where they show the kind of frantic exhausting rush of parenthood in those early days - trying to quickly eat a few bites while soothing the baby and going out with spit up stains on your shirt and I honestly feel that scene in my bones. It's been a year since I've seen it and I keep thinking back on it now.",

            "comment": "So I finished **Duty After School**. I went in knowing that the ending was collectively disliked without having any any idea what that ending might be (and I haven't read the webtoon). \n\nDuring the whole show, me and my husband were trying to figure out how they were going to mess up the ending. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAfter many iterations, our most plausible takes were that &gt;!the winter will come and all the aliens will die out of cold!&lt;, followed by &gt;!it is all just a dream!&lt; and &gt;!humans will lose and aliens will dominate the Earth.!&lt;.\n\nDuring a brief moment in ep 10, I thought that my idea of it all &gt;!being just a dream turned out to be correct!&lt;, but nope. \n\nYeah, only in the middle of ep 9, my husband called out the actual conclusion. And, in my opinion, that was the problem. If given proper development that ending could've worked, but, instead, it seemed to come out of nowhere. They should've shown &gt;!Young-soo's slow descend into madness and developed the reasons behind it.!&lt; \n\nThe thing that annoyed me for the whole show stands out even more in the conclusion. Essentially, &gt;!It has never been established that the students' families were Ok. I know that the students were told that their families were evacuated, but the authorities have lied to them before. Also, after everything that the students have seen (ex: mass casualties in the city, military not being able to keep the aliens out), I think that it would be natural to be worried.!&lt;\n\n\n&gt;!With that in mind, it renders the thought that Young-soo gets so upset about his exam being postponed even more ridiculous. Basically, he is worried about not being able to help his family financially in the future when there is no certainty that his family is still alive. Get your priorities straight, damn it!!&lt;\n\n\nOverall, the show was terrible at communicating it's message. I found that it had some\u00a0 compelling parts, but narratively it was a mess and, frankly speaking, the second part smelled of a hasty rewrite.\n\nAs a serious piece of media, it fails on every level. However, knowing what I was signing up for and seeing it as a guilty pleasure, it was actually quite entertaining.",

So in a sense, he never had his priorities 'straight' because he has always been &gt;!intensely focused on *himself* and his future, and anything that took away from the 'happy, successful' outcome he envisioned for himself was a serious threat!&lt;, I'd say that even without the spheres, if YS had &gt;!failed to do well on the *suneung*, he'd still be likely to enact violence against others or himself because of his inability to deal with his failure!&lt;.\n\nYS's obsession and outcome then becomes even more of a scathing take on Korea's academic obsession, especially when it comes to the *suneung*. In a country that basically ['pauses' for the *suneung*](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/11/16/national/socialAffairs/korea-csat-suneung/20221116184125040.html), it's not surprising that obsession with it leads to lack of rationality.\n\nAnd for a country that has experienced the &gt;!loss of youngsters in both the Sewol tragedy and more recently, the Itaewon crowd crush tragedy!&lt; -- the drama's condemnation of &gt;!failure by government higher ups (as shown both by the initial encounter with the sphere that nearly wiped out an entire squad and how high school seniors had to be sacrificed to the war) and its academic obsession!&lt; can be keenly felt.",

                            "comment": "&gt; I'd argue YS's character is 'well-developed' given the cultural background -- or that is to say, as a viewer who is familiar with the kind of academic obsession that YS is partaking in, the drama showed more than enough about YS for me to anticipate and understand his outcome. \n\nHmmm, maybe indeed for someone who is more familiar with these types of academic pressures, it makes more sense. \n\nHowever, I've seen kdramas that presented the topic in a much better way (ex.: Sky Castle). The interesting thing about art is that it allows you to see the world through somebody else's eyes and to relate to people who had wastly different experiences from yours. Here, I really couldn't feel it. \n\nOverall, while I agree that the characters would be more relarable to someone who has gone through a similar situation, I also think that they could've done a better job at unpacking the whole thing. \n\n&gt;His success &gt;!on the suneung would mean (in his mind) his escape from the poverty and hardships of his family and therefore is a decidedly personal and selfish obsession, his utterances of his 'helping his family' is a 'honorable' facade to hide behind and befitting his role as a son.!&lt;\n\n\nOh, I absolutely missed this. To be honest, I thought that his primary goal was to start working as fast as possible so he can help his siblings. But yeah, from that perspective, that makes absolutely more sense. \n\n&gt; the drama's condemnation of failure by government higher ups \n\nOk, that part felt very odd.&gt;! Most of governmental decision were baffling to me, but in different types of way. On one hand, they walk high schoolers through the city, where aliens can show up, without telling them about the invasion. They send high schoolers to destroy the smaller spheres at some random place, because they are incertain what will happen when the bigger spheres will start to fall. They test all types of different weapons against aliens, including vapor, but they don't test the cold? How?!&lt; \n\n&gt;!However, on the other hand, it is established that the students are nineteen years old. Technically speaking, they are adults and are old enough to serve in the army. As horrible as it might sound,\u00a0 I am certain that in case of a real major conflict, the government would be able to conscript them without jumping through the hoops of offering them exam points.!&lt; \n\nI mean, I understood what the show was trying to do, but it felt so clumsy at it. Certainly, it was easier for someone more familiar with the culture to catch certain details, but I still think that the drama had some good idea and could've developed them better. That beind said, it was still quite entertaining.\n\nBut anyways, thank you for your input. It was really interesting to see this drama through a different perspective.",

I just need something light and fluffy. Shows like the Glory etc are so great but I'm so tired of all these revenge, dark dramas.\n\nLife is dismal enough lol, I need happy \ud83d\ude02",

Then came 2521, and I looked up a little gem of a movie Little Forest, and for something really different, Space Sweepers. Cannot wait for Revenant!\n\nUnder the Queen's Umbrella - Kim Hye-soo was terrific as the Queen - I have made a point to watch some of her other dramas, including Signal\n\nDoom at Your Service - Park Bo-young - loved her, then followed up with Strong Girl Bong-soon - adorable, as well as competent characters.\n\nExtraordinary Attorney Woo - Park Eun-bin - She played a difficult role that could have gone so wrong if not done well. I haven't followed up with other dramas of hers yet, but have The King's Affection on my watch list.\n\nDescendants of the Sun - Song Hye-Kyo - I didn't technically follow other dramas because of this series, but then saw Glory, where she was totally different. \n\nHealer - I recently finished this, and liked Park Min-Young's character - I see she is in several dramas that have been recommended, so I have added to my watch list.\n\nAre there actresses you have gotten hooked on after watching a drama series?",

                    "comment": "**Kim Go Eun** in Little Women. She played that character so well. I was stressed out for her. She's good at looking completely vulnerable. Very suprised Pikachu. \n\n**Shin Hyun Bin** in Hospital Playlist and Reflection of You. Poker faced but crumbling on the inside acting. Her acting comes mostly from her eyes. Chin down,look up. Deliver line. Repeat. But she's good at her job.\n\n**Lee El** in My Liberation Notes and Happiness Battle. Just cool and honest older sister vibes. I'm currently loving her role in Happiness Battle. Being defiant and doing what's right. \n\n**Kim Seo Hyung** in Mine and SKY Castle. The Korean Tilda Swinton. Sophisticated and a but masculine older woman that I have a serious crush. She tends to play quiet storm characters and when they reach their limit? Oh my heart.\n\n**Seo Ye Ji**  in Save Me. I've seen Eve and It's Okay to Be Okay but Save Me was the first time I saw her. I was stunned at how deep and smokey her voice was. She's best at playing mysterious and sultry. Her acting relies on both her voice and serious eye contact.",

I have yet to see any show that she's done that isn't enjoyable. \n\nYoo In-na- I just always like her shows. Touch Your Heart, The Spy That Loved Me, Bora Deborah. They always tend to have that classic kdrama feel thats nice. I find that in her shows, even though she's always cute, she has this badass/crazy aspect to her that I like. Loved her in Snowdrop!\n\nKim Da-mi: started with Our Beloved Summer,, but then I went on to watch her in Soulmate and The Witch. Loved her in all 3, Soulmate honestly made me cry. \n\nAnd like you said Kim Tae-ri \ud83d\ude0d\nShe's such a natural and everything she touches is gold. Looking forward to her new show.",

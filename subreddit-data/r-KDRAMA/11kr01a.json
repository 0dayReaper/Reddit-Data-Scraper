    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.

I\u2019ve tried watching **Crash Landing on You** three times and I just can't... there's something that makes me quit. I also put so much pressure on myself to like it even though that's stupid \ud83d\ude02 but I don't know how to stop that. When I have low expectations of a drama, I find that I end up enjoying it more. I don't know if someone else relates. \n\nAnyways, I'm probably in a drama slump these days because I don't feel like watching any drama (or maybe mediocre dramas) and I was pretty much just watching the on-airs and I'm *only* excited about **Taxi Driver\u2019s** new episodes. I\u2019m enjoying **Heavenly Idol** too but it\u2019s not \u2728 outstanding \u2728 but that\u2019s fine. Not every drama has to be great/ has to have something new or extraordinary. It\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s entertaining. \n\nI tried the first episode of the second season of **Dr. Romantic** and it\u2019s SO GOOD \ud83d\ude33. I started it at 11 pm last night and I didn't want to stop. I watched 2 episodes last night and didn't want to stop, so I\u2019ll be watching that one and try to finish it before season 3 comes out! \ud83d\ude0c\n\nExcitedly waiting for **The Glory Part 2**.",

The villains are also unrealistic and over the top. \n\nThey forgot to make the characters wear the pins with an image of The Great Leader, which is a strange oversight. Women today also have to do many years of military in North Korea, but we don't see any \u2013 maybe the defectors that were sources didn't know  enough about this change. (There are not that many women though, and possibly they don't serve in the units shown.) [Here](https://www.theworldmind.org/home/2022/5/5/drafted-into-abuse-the-experiences-of-female-soldiers-in-north-koreas-military) is an interesting article about women in the military.\n\nSome people claim the drama romanticises North Korea, but if you look closely, you can even see a child being in danger of dying of hunger. Not everybody notices the negative parts, though. And of course: The drama cannot mention the Great Leader, because he is almost like a religion in NK, so if they had mentioned him there would have been a war.\n\nAnd as usual, I bet that if you count screen time, men has the double compared to women.",

I understand if they didn't portray certain things right, but what I don't understand is why MLs are shown to be overpowered and have to save/protect the FL every time. It's fine if it happens in one show out of twenty but this seems to be the case in almost all of the dramas. Definitely not just the case with k-dramas because movies/shows in my country are even worse when it comes to this, but it's still something that annoys me! \n\nAnd thank you so much for the article!",

Sometimes they have to make the woman very clumsy or idiot to be able to pull it off. Is it the male public's dream to ~~have a clumsy idiot girlfriend~~ to save their woman? Or is it the female public's dream to be saved? Or is it just an old fashioned idea of the creators? \n\nI definitely see it also in a several \"feminist\" dramas, and also read the discussion here, and many people don't seem to notice that it happens. Example **Search WWW** where Bae Ta Mi gets saved every time by ML, including with some very idiot advice that everyone should know, but people are all \"oh, she is a boss! Female empowerment!\" But the worst in this regard must be **Alchemy of Souls, Part two** and **Mirror of the Witch**, where FL mysteriously couldn't use any of her superpowers ever. \n\nAnyway, I love **Crashlanding**. The depiction of North Korea is very interesting. The side characters are fun. No drama is perfect.",

It can't show both spouses with each other when it can barely establish their characters and their roles beyond the cliches. \n\nWhy did these people marry? What was their relationship? How did the relationship start breaking down? Was the husband always like that? If so, why marry him? Why not divorce before the affair? There isn't much effort to really explore the relationship. \n\nAnd add this whole thing to the fact that both cases about divorce so far has been about a sympathetic woman and evil husband. If the genders of these characters were flipped then maybe it would've been easier to highlight the issues with the portrayal?",

The drama spent the most time on rationalizing the breakdown of the marriage and her affair and all those issues as if she was only a single woman. The problem is that she's also a mom and actually the reason why Attny SSH even took the case is bc of the kid angle. Actually from Attny SSH's perspective, he's shown that he is less interested in the end of the romantic relationship between a couple and more compelled by the impact on the family unit - especially the children.\n\nSo for dramatic audience impact, we focused mostly on husband vs wife fight, and the drama only QUIETLY implied that she hasn't been around for her son until now bc of work and other priorities. That they made a big deal about her looking up a simple recipe on the internet means she doesn't cook for her son. That she had to even ask her son if she could bring him to school means she hasnt been doing that either. So who has been doing all the child care? The dad? The kid himself? There's no nanny. That was the point of the painting.\n\nBut instead of laying it out there CLEARLY that she's been an absent mother bc of work and her affair - and her son knew it - but she's STILL better suited as a custodial parent compared to the emotionally abusive father, they downplayed the mom part and cranked up the pitiful wife part.\n\nIf the second case came before the first, it'd be better on a social commentary front because the more you deal with family law the more you realize the worst part about divorce isnt the end of the spousal relationship (although that really sucks) - it's the affect on the family ties that grew on top of that basis.\n\nBut that messes up the grapes and the true focus of the drama. The divorce cases of the day are just plot devices to fill up time and move along the ML's revenge against his sister's family. If they spent any time on the background of each couple, they sacrifice screen time spent on their narrative purpose to the main plot. Ultimately the mini stories about the divorcing couples will likely just be surface level and tropey, only intended to dig out a touching moment with the audience and galvanize Attny SSH on his revenge.",

The guy had previously lived in Norway and had an ex girlfriend who showed up in the drama also from Norway. I think the guy had trauma from a house fire or getting lost in the snow or something? and the guy gifted the main girl a eucalyptus plant because on the floor below the recording studio was a plant store. there were also a lot of coffee shop scenes where the main couple would sit in the same spot by a window with a pretty tree. I don't know if this is enough but if you have any ideas TIA!!!!",

            "comment": "SOLVED: Bad and Crazy !!\n\nI'm looking for a drama series. I only remember the 2 side characters. They are drug dealers. The man kind of has \"her bodyguard\" vibes. She has short black hair and exhausted eyes with a sharp face; usually seen sucking on a red lollipop. I don't remember much about him. They sell drugs with a special design on them. \n\nI remember one scene where the girl is sitting in front of an old man eating on a dining table; the man is sitting on a couch next to her. She kind of eats visibly fast and the old man says some rude stuff, so she gets fed up with is arrogance and smashes a wine bottle on the old man's head.",

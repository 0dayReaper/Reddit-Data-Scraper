The actor Won  Tae Min has my entire heart - he was in \"You Make Me Dance\" too, another KBL (not very good either but good lead chemistry). He knows how to act and uses his whole body - and the two characters are polar opposites. \n\nI read it should shoot in the next few months and premiere in early 2024. \n\nLetsssss go!",

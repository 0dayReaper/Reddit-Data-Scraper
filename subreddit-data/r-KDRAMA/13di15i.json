After that, she lives her life with memories from all of her previous lives. She hates remembering all her of previous lives and whenever she faces the end of her life, she jopes that she will never be reborn or remember her previous lives. \n\nIn her 18th life, when she was Yoon Joo-Won and 12 years old, she met a kid named Moon Seo-Ha. They became very close. In her current 19th life and as Ban Ji-Eum, she again meets Moon Seo-Ha (Ahn Bo-Hyun). He is now all grown up. Ban Ji-Eum is fully aware of who Moon Seo-Ha is and approaches him with affection.\n\nMeanwhile, when Moon Seo-Ha was a kid, he lost people that he loved, including his first love Yoon Joo-Won. Since then, he has refused to have relationships with other people. His life changes due to the appearance of the strange woman named Ban Ji-Eum.\n\n[(source)](https://asianwiki.com/See_You_in_My_19th_Life)",

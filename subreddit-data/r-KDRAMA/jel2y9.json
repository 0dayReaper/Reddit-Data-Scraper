So I started watching other kdramas and the pandemic and wfh situation has given me so much time that I watched so many kdramas. \n\nThey have been my gateway to escape the reality and calm me down honestly! I also think we got lucky SK handled the pandemic well because we didn\u2019t really halt on the incoming new dramas!",

It's great to see him in an action role because he's never done one and he does a great job.  If you're not familiar with who he is, check him out.  He's a really good actor and he's adorbs.  I'm currently watching his drama, Psychopath's Diary, and it's really funny.  His drama, The Best Hit, is a comedy and I loved it.  He also did a mellow drama called Your Honor that's about the relationship between a Judge and a Prosecutor.  But if you really want to start at the start with Yoon Shi Yoon, watch, Baker King Kim Tak Goo (also called Bread, Love, and Dreams).  It also stars Joo Won and it's a classic K Drama story.  It was his first drama and he kills it.",

It's probably saved my brain from 2020.",

CLOY set such an impossibly high benchmark, that every drama pales in comparison.  \n\nOf those you have watched, what are your top 3 favs?",

Probably some of the freshest writing and tight plotting I've seen so far.\n\nWhat's super refreshing in Kdramas is the restraint and decorum. The portray relationshops that don't conflate attraction or love with immediate physical intimacy. Maybe Korean dating and relationships IRL are way different but for me as a viewer, I prefer their cinematic moral code to that of North American or European shows where protagonists have sex as casually ordering a venti lattte.",

I've watched about a dozen other dramas but I still come back to CLOY.  How can I still laugh and cry at scenes I've watched over and over????   This could have a longer lasting effect than the Corona pandemic itself!\n\nOther dramas I recommend:  Legend of the Blue Sea (same writer as CLOY), Alone In Love (also with the amazing Son Ye Jin), Personal Taste (Lee Min Ho AND Son Ye Jin - somewhat dated but fun) and Secret Garden (mostly for Hyun Bin playing the female role).",

    "postText": "I just finished Reborn Rich today and I loved it. This is my second drama watch starring Song Jong Ki; the first one being DOTS.\n\nThe poster tagline was what got me interested:\n\n&gt;Reborn to the family that killed me \n\nThe story follows Hyeon Woo, a loyal and dedicated employee to the Soonyang Corporation, who gets murdered while following orders and gets reborn as Do Jun, the youngest member of the conglomerate family. \n\n**Things I loved**\n\n* Hyeon Woo/Do Jun didn't turn into a magnanimous person. In the hands of a different writer, they would've written his character to be suddenly different after he was reborn into a rich family. Thank God it didn't happen that way. He wasn't overly charitable to the people who was affected by the company's decisions (mass layoffs, cheated minority investors, etc). He did what he could as a person who could control the tide and lessen the burden of the ordinary people but that's it. No cheesy lines about *saving the little guy* or *giving back to the people*.\n\n* Chairman Jin Yang-cheol and Do Jun's relationship. From the get-go, they have a complex connection. Do Jun admired his grandfather but he's also the head of the family that killed him/Hyeon Woo. They share similarities in character but differences in motivation. The grandfather admires his grandson that is much like him and the grandson has grown to be wanting to impress him. \n\n* Do Jun's partner, Oh Se Hyun, is a good businessman. But he didn't turn into a confidant. That is to say\u2014 he wasn't in the whole being reborn of Hyeon Woo into Do Jun and wasn't aware of Do Jun's real motivation in taking Soonyang (which was to get revenge). It fits the bill because Se Hyun's motivation to help Do Jun was that he thinks that only competent people should run businesses (which Do Jun is). To show that big corporations shouldn't be monopolized by a single family. Doesn't make sense if they made him a confidant and helps DJ in his revenge. Because he's shown as a business partner more than a friend.\n\n* Hwa-Young's husband or Choi Chang-Je. The character development from a meek in-law walking on eggshells around the Soonyang family to a confident politician was so good. I love that he has his clear ideals and platform but bends them whenever he will get benefit. Lol a true politician right there.\n\n* The ending. &gt;!Hyeon Woo won. He got his revenge of taking Soonyang from the Soonyang family and uncovering who's behind his murder. A happy ending doesn't necessarily mean that he should've gotten Soonyang because that wasn't his goal in the first place. He specifically mentions not wanting to be chairman but only wanted buy Soonyang (in effect, taking the company from the family). It also wouldn't make any sense either if he also ended up with Min-Yeong after he's back to being Hyeon-Woo because what kind of person gets into a relationship with an accomplice to her fiance's murder? Their last meeting shows the Hyeon-Woo understood that wasn't right and parted ways with her in good terms. Which is the best possible conclusion between them!&lt;\n\n* The acting all-around. SJK was great as well as the rest of the cast. But Lee Sung Min was absolutely dynamite. He really played the role perfectly. From his little facial expressions of curiousity, approval, and disappointment to his family and Do Jun. He didn't just play a stone-cold businessman but he also showed some humanity in the character. Chairman Jin showed sentimantality towards his businesses (SY Motors/Semiconductors) and didn't just cut them off because of profit. He was also (at times) affectionate towards his grandchildren. And LSM did that all flawlessly. \n\n\n**Things I didn't love:**\n\n* Plot hole likes &gt;!the recording Hyeon Woo played during the trial in the last ep. Who recorded that? How? With what? Based on the scene, HW was too shocked to even think about recording the conversation, let alone having a device to record it on. Also, why did the call didn't end when he and the manager finished their talk? It seems funny to let the call continue then talk to another person after!&lt; or &gt;!Do Jun not anticipating Chairman Jin's death and having scenes thinking about it and how it will play out and what will he do!&lt;\n\n* The middle part of the drama got repetitive. Soonyang wants to buy x company or do y thing but Do Jun steps in their way. Soonyang siblings/chairman find a way to bypass him and thinks they won but in the end, it was all part of Do Jun's plan and he wins. The way Se Hyun kept saying the line \"just as you planned\" to Do Jun got old quick after the first two times.\n\n* The way Do Jun got instantly attracted to Min-Yeong. He already met her when he was Hyeon Woo but he fell for her when he became Do Jun? I feel like it's not really established how he got the feels for Min Yeong at the beginning. \n\n* Do Jun's brother just being there for comedic effect or as a guide to give Do Jun ideas. I mean, it's so obvious whenever he's on screen that he'll say some offhand comment and Do Jun will think of a way to solve his problem. The brother got one decent scene at the &gt;!hospital when DJ got hurt from the truck accident!&lt; but that's it. I know he's a minor character but his role and actions are just too predictable. It's off-putting.\n\n* There were so little scenes of child Do Jun. I wanted to see more of how Hyeon Woo first adjusted to the Soonyang family. Side note: The child actor was so good!!! I hope Kim Kang-hoon gets more roles.\n\n\n\nOverall, the it's a well-produced and solid drama perfect for binge watching. It kept the tone of the drama throughout, kept the romance minimal, gave great dynamics between the characters, and was gripping enough to get you hooked. Minus some repetitive arcs and plot holes, it's a great watch.",

The real core of the story was the relationship between Do-jun and the Chairman. All of their scenes together were dynamite.\n\nI ordinarily dislike makjang revenge stories, but I loved this show.",

The latest chapter is nowhere near the end. Currently in the webtoon, Do Jun just entered college. This is like chapter 15 or 16. It's a lot more interesting quite frankly, to read it. Even though kts steady paced and detailed, every chapter is exciting leaves the reader at a cliff hanger. Definitely a good read.\n\nhttps://m.webtoons.com/en/drama/reborn-rich/list?title_no=4956",

I can be a bit picky about shows cuz I've edited a lot of video and my patience for bad pacing is lower than others, but it definitely felt a bit slow and bland from what I did make it through. Didn't even like the color grade or framing, the shots just didn't feel like they were immersing me into the scene and between dialogue all that much. I like the actors I can see why it did well just from that alone, but I found it lacking overall and just didn't do much to draw me into the story. Wasn't the Vincenzo Pt2 people were hyping it as either, perhaps that also had something to do with it.",

I will agree that the actors were failed by the script and the director here; we know they can both pull off romantic roles and chemistry, but it didn't really work out, especially with the real relationship focus of the show being Jin Yang-cheol and Jin Do-jun's relationship, which was just so much more compelling.",

I do feel though, some moments were a little awkward, almost like he suddenly didn't like her anymore or something to then suddenly fall back for her.

Not even as a plot hole, but because of the implications it has on the purpose of the transmigration. The existence of the &gt;!recording!&lt; lessens the extent hyunwoo changed because of the transmigration in ways that affect the plot of the story. \n\nI hate that they tried to turn his revenge into some big societal message last second. I hate that he had to become rich and then poor again to be empowered to do the right thing. This show messed up all its messaging because it got to enthralled in the succsssion war and revenge. \n\nFor the ending to make any sense for hyunwoo as a character, i needed to believe that even with &gt;!recorded evidence!&lt; without having been dojun, he would have sided with the Soonyang family. I simply don't. The writers didn't do anything to make me believe that, and instead showed me that hyunwoo was a smart, caring, just man. If he sided with them after they tried &gt;!to kill him and left him to take the fall for the paper company!&lt;, then i would have expected him to be very different as Dojun. Secondly, the heart of the drama should have been relationships. Everyone points out how the dojun grandpa relationship is well explored and amazing, and i agree. The problem is that &gt;!the grandpa dies before the return to the present timeline!&lt;. So the impact to theme of repentance is so much more stifled compared to the possibilities with Minyeong, dojuns mom, dojuns dad or dojuns brother. But these relationships are so underdeveloped in the story that there is no emotional exploration to the reveal &gt;!that hyunwoo is a perpetrator to people he loves/loved!&lt; Basically, the writers said \"actually the point of the drama all along were relationships we didn't care to develop\".\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts. It was a good drama. Could have been amazing drama. Just can't get past the question: what was the point of the transmigration? None of the answers seem good, and this drama took itself too seriously for there not to be a good answer. Reborn rich in more ways than one is a story of what could have been.",

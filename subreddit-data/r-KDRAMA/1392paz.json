He simply cheated on you the moment you weren\u2019t there. Then he got married and started a family with someone else. He ruined your relationship with your family and created a tense relationship with your daughter. What\u2019s so great about this guy? She\u2019s delusional. She doubles down and brings herself and her daughter back to Korea to live full time where they both face prejudice and stigma. And for what? So she can carry out their affair in the same country? Absolute garbage person and parent. The husband will never leave doctor cha willingly. He has too much pride. That\u2019s why her fortune is that of a mistress. She also has too pride. She chose the wrong man to double down on. He\u2019s shown early on that he wasn\u2019t worth it.",

Him/ his mom wants a full time maid with no remuneration to be paid.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is the main reason he won\u2019t leave Dr.Cha. I think it\u2019s his pride and reputation. He cares too much about how people perceive him. He can\u2019t have coworkers and patients know for sure that he\u2019s an adulterer. I also think I-rang and (especially) Jung-min\u2019s &gt;!reactions!&lt; are getting to him.\n\nAs for his mom, I think it\u2019s both reputation and because of finances.\nWe see her warn Dr. Cha to keep her distance from Dr. Roy Kim in order to protect her husband\u2019s reputation, so it makes sense she\u2019s against it to protect his reputation. And just like &gt;!I-rang!&lt; has already started to do, people (like her classmates at the reunion) will talk about how she didn\u2019t raise her son properly. Divorce might also be stigmatized and impact her grandkids. \nAnd while unfair, people might even speculate that she cheated on her own husband with that doctor she\u2019s currently secretly dating and that her son \u201clearned\u201d this sort of behavior from her. Also, we know she put a building under Dr. Cha\u2019s name, if a divorce happens, she won\u2019t be able to get access to it as easily. &gt;!Maybe she\u2019ll lose her investments in the convalescent homes to Dr. Cha!&lt;",

She definitely has potential, but she knows her boyfriend's dad is having an affair and says nothing and that's been infuriating. I wonder how he will feel when he finds out she knew way before him, if that will bother him, some people would rather not be told.",

She would always associate him with that revelation and he would get nowhere. \nI am fairly sure now that Roy and the FL are headed towards romance and not brother-sisterly love thanks to some foreshadowing by the astrologer lady.\nWhile I found that her children were incredibly condescending by thinking their mother was too weak to handle this, the previews gave me so much hope. Also loved how quickly the FL overcame her tears and looked so powerful. She put that annoying girl who asked to switch out of Family Medicine in her place really fast.\nI love this show. I was avoiding it because I thought it was going to be too angsty and cringey, but aside from the first episode, this show moved out of that zone rapidly. \n\nThey also cast the husband perfectly because you love to hate him. He really has zero charm and is lucky that he found an insecure mistress. So, you feel confident that he is going to be miserable by the end. Even if he stays with his mistress nothing good qill come of it and no one is going to envy him.\n\nFinally, his illegitimate daughter is the only character I feel really sorry for.

Once she had the affair and the child, the damage was seemingly done and it couldn't get much worse. Seriously, she was already the mistress with the lovechild. Being the married mistress would redeem her situation, far better than even being single or finding another relationship.

It's not easy to look at mom's face and say dad's cheating on you.\n\nI don't hate Eunseo for telling Irang. She's the only one who started telling the truth in this drama. She's the victim too. I don't think she wants the father back; she just wants everything to burn at this point. But Seunghi's behavior was just classic mistress behavior, and so petty.\n\nMy blood pressure escalated the same way as the MIL when Dr. Seo told the story of his affair. It just kept getting worse and worse. Hit him more!\n\nI don't like the look of next week's preview except the part of Dr. Cha leaving the house. Now praying to the writer not to make me hate watching this drama. The next episode will be crucial to where the show is going.\n\nI don't even want Dr. Cha to end up with Dr. Roy. She just needs to be happy on her own without any men in her life.",

Maybe he threatens to fire her is she divorces him or something along that lines.\n\nIf Dr. Kim and Dr. Cha start a relationship, I doubt it will be before episode 15,14 at the absolute earliest. I don't think she'd want to until the divorce is finalized. We also know that Dr. Kim is trying to find his birth parents so there is that subplot to unpack yet. Also, I don't know if anyone noticed, but the show keeps playing like he is a lot younger than her and he gets called the hot, young, surgeon. His documents at the orphanage listed his birth year as 1980, so he is only 43-44, putting him 2-3 years younger than Cha.",

But my opinion is a little different: put yourself in the children's shoes. You just found out that the father is cheating and has a child out of wedlock. You don't know if your siblings know too.  (as far as you are concerned, only you know). Think how hard it is to make a decision on how to say, what to say. I'm sure it takes a few days to recover from the discovery and then think about how to tell mom. It is very very difficult!   \nIn my opinion, as we will see in the next episode, it will be a matter of a few days from the moment the children found out until the moment Doctor Cha finds out on her own and I assume that if more time had passed (even two weeks) they would have told her but by this time she would have found out on her own. In short, I think the judgment towards them is excessive. It's not something you find out and run to tell your mother in a minute. It is very difficult.",

Also his treatment of her at the hospital and intentionally sabotaging her career. It also sounds like in 101 that they've had no marital relations in over 10 years. There is also his decision in 101/102 to not do the transplant knowing that she was essentially days away from death.\n\nI think when she told Dr. Kim in 103 that it takes a 1000 times more courage to file for divorce than to get married, meant she was already considering it just because of his willingness to let her die, but she hadn't worked up the courage or was hoping to be more financially independent first.

At first Doctor Cha had nothing, no initiative, no power within the family dynamics, no career, and no respect.  She had exactly two people who supported her, her friend and her mother.\n\nLater on, I predict that this dynamic will flip.  Her sun will rise and his will set. She will obtain proof of her husband's cheating which means she basically \"wins\" the divorce and can dictate her terms.  She is gaining confidence in her abilities and is slowly gaining recognition in her career.  She is gaining supporters, The CEO and Doctor Roy to name a few.  Having the building in her name will only be another element that strengthens her position for her after her MIL is humiliated by falling for a scam.  \n\nNot sure if I am right, but I am looking forward to finding out how this fits into the puzzle.  Sign of a good show.",

I swear, every episode is the highlight of my weekend!\n\nWill Dr. Cha feel sad or betrayed that Dr. Roy didn't tell her about the affair? I'm not sure she would have expected him to have told her since they're not super close friends. As much as I would like to see them together I think she would need time to process all her major life changes so he might only get the \"let's be friends\" line.\n\nI'm glad that she figured out the affair herself. She's a smart woman who's constantly being underestimated by others who ought to know her best.\n\nI felt so bad for her, seeing her radiant expression regarding her birthday dinner change to a hardened mask of disillusionment. Her acting is wonderful--I can't help but root for her!",

Seeing Dr. Roy show genuine interest in Dr. Cha is challenging the husband's ego, to the point where he's starting to look at her with a slightly different perspective, like \"What could he possibly see in her? Regardless, she's mine.\"  As for the ending, I think you're right that it's bc she's the mother of his children....but I wonder if it's also because he ultimately wants both women in his life as they each serve a purpose for him. He had everyone compartmentalized so nicely and now it's all falling apart lol !&lt;",

One of the great k-drama and anime cliches, I suppose.\n\nIt was very affirming and cathartic to hear the mother-in-law wring out and hit Seo In-ho for his dastardly deeds. \n\nShe's saying everything we've been feeling for weeks. Very disappointing MIL and I-rang want to continue deceiving Dr. Cha tho. Everyone is making that choice (including Dr. Kim), and it's the wrong choice, ngl.\n\nI don't appreciate the husband acting like a kicked dog after getting scolded by MIL and gis daughter when it is 100% deserved. This drama isn't tough on him like a person would be IRL. Very apologist and not based in a logic I'm familiar with.\n\nYou know you've made some serious erroneous life choices when you're adult son says he's disappointed in you and doesn't respect you.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Dr. Cha came to slay in that outfit. \n\nIdk what the heck Choi Seung-hi was thinking and hoped to accomplish by showing up there. Maybe trying to do the reverse of what I-rang did to their family dinner earlier? Idk bc it don't make sense.\n\nI felt when Jeong-suk cried after figuring it out, but I'm so happy she knows now. She won't continue to be this unwitting victim we pity who can't change her situation. She can actively do something about it. \n\nI dearly hope she does do something to change the situation and doesn't forgive Seo In-ho or let him off the hook.

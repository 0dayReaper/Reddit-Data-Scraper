He robs the rich of their illegally gained cultural artifacts and gives them to the police (Robin Hood Style). So now he has to take care that the team won't find out his secret identity. His thief identity is also very fun, as he doesn't talk and gesticulates to communicate with his \"victims\". Lots of funny moments. The bad guy is looking for a lost treasure. So I hope/guess treasure hunting will be a part of the plot",

They've been pulling me through!\n\nFinished:\n**Would You Like a Cup of Coffee?** What a lovely little healing drama. It had a couple moments of over-explaining I could do without, but all the characters were just wonderful.  I really loved the observations on the cultural background of espresso.\n\nCurrently watching:\n\n**Kingdom** S1 (4/6): I'm enjoying this way more than I thought I would. I wish Bae Doo Na got to do more, though.\n\n**The Real has Come** (7/50): I started this because the premise sounds interesting, and I thought it would be a fun experience (and almost like gambling) to watch a longform drama as it airs.  So far, I'm enjoying it! I kept bracing myself for some preaching (one way or the other) because of the FL's unwed pregnancy, but I feel that overall the writer did a nice even-handed job of showing societal expectations/reactions, the FL's journey to the decision she has made, and alternate viewpoints. It's a promising start.",

It's impressive how the over-the-top comedy doesn't drown out the heartfelt parts. Ki-bong and Yoo-ri also stole the show, they're such an adorable duo.\n\n**Feel Good to Die (32/32):** So frickin' good! It's probably one of my top 10 k-dramas. The use of the Groundhog Day meta and Kang Ji-hwan's performance were brilliant. The messaging is introspective without getting too preachy. The story constantly reaches multiple highs not often seen in a 16-episode series (it's a double episode feature), with the &gt;!main character's death mid-series and the sudden main character switch!&lt; being the masterstroke.\n\n**At a Distance, Spring is Green (12/12):** I thought it was gonna be another typical school drama (the romance element kinda was), but the story does a great job of peeling the layers of each of the 3 main characters that I eventually fell in love with all of them. The developing friendship of Yeo-jun and Soo-hyun was heartwarming to witness, although So-bin slowly took the backseat in the middle of the series because of it.\n\n***In Progress***\n\n**The Real Has Come! (8/50):** So far it's been fun, although I don't know if that's because my last makjang was many years ago (My Golden Life), and makjang is known to be trope-y and predictable. However I noticed how Baek Jin-hee easily gels with her male leads, despite their characters in this series being very far yet from romance; in Feel Good to Die, I didn't mind whether her character ended up with Kang Ji-hwan's or Gong Myung's because she had good chemistry with both.",

Really loved the angsty romance of the FL and how they dealt with her character. She made me fall in love with her personality more and more as I went on. I'm happy with the way the drama ended, too. What a short and nice drama. It gave me the feels, but it left me satisfied. 7.5/10. Would recommend if you like the fantasy genre.\n* **Suits (16/16)** \u2014 This one, I didn't care for, honestly. It's mostly because I've seen a few seasons of the original US series, and that one is much better in my opinion. I barely cared for these characters. which is a shame cause I wanted to like it. 2/10. A little too harsh, but it failed to capture my attention.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (16/16)** \u2014 I disliked season 2 because I didn't feel the emotions and desperation of the victims as I did in season 1. It didn't feel like it had heart and soul like it used to. There are some entertaining parts, but I can't overlook the bad. I couldn't care less for the victims and the cases. 4/10. Huge jump from my season one rating of 9.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Joseon Attorney (6/16)** \u2014 This week had the best 2 episodes so far. I love how they reveal Han Su's backstory throughout the drama. They just keep peeling it little by little. Woo Do Hwan smashed it out of the part this week. The emotions on his face, so good. And the chemistry between the leads ... they're teasing us. The viewers said this, but the 2ML has zero chance. I'm sorry, dude. The main ship is too strong.\n* **Romance is a Bonus Book (8/16)** \u2014 Doing this one from the beginning for the challenge, and I love it! It makes me feel happy and good on the inside. And the supporting characters make this drama complete. I love everyone. Can't wait to go further into it. All I know is that I'm rooting for everyone's happiness.",

It feels good to finally have an airing drama that I'm excited about after having nothing for so long, but it's getting hard to wait for new episodes. I'm definitely in my xianxia era lately. Also binged **The Starry Love** right before this and loved that too, so I've accepted that the demon/heavenly realm pairing is very much my thing and I will eat it up every time lol.\n\nI picked up **Tale of the Nine-Tailed** to watch in between waiting for episodes in anticipation of the new season. Saw a lot of harsh comments about it when it was airing so it was never really on my radar before. I'm forcing myself anyway though and hoping maybe I'll have a different opinion.",

But I do wish that the tone was less bombastic.\n\n**When My Love Blooms** (5/16): What interests me about relationships in dramas is *human* relationships, not romance per se. But I\u2019ve recently discovered that if it\u2019s a classical, old-fashioned melodrama, I\u2019m 100% on board. This series fits the bill wonderfully.",

Looking forward to some fluff in the last episode.\n\n**Animals** (JDrama) - such a good show! Well written and well paced and it does that JDrama thing where it's as much a character drama as a romance. I actually wish it was longer. Also, the male cast is like a who's who of JBL, but all playing straight characters. (Izuka Kenta from The Novelist, Jin Shirasu from Life: Love on the Line, and Honda Kyoya from Jack O'Frost.)\n\n**Peak Time** \\- got a bit stalled on this after the first elimination. The episodes are soooo long, although it's a variety show, so it's easy to pause and come back.\n\nOn Hold:\n\n**Love to Hate You** \\- should be starting this back up again this weekend now that we're wrapping up Strong Woman.\n\nCompleted:\n\n**Hometown Cha Cha Cha** \\- I was really ambivalent about this drama. I really liked the FL, SML and some of the side characters, but I was not enthused about the ML. Overall it wasn't bad, and it fills one of my KDC challenge categories, but I wouldn't watch it again.\n\n**Unintentional Love Story** \\- just kind of fizzled out. I initially liked it, but it got draggy and rushed at the end. Plus the second couple had basically no development, so what was even the point of them?\n\nOther Shows:\n\n**Bed Friend** \\- where did the spice go???? I like the sweetness, but you can have both!\n\n**A Boss and a Babe** \\- it's sweet and fun, although it's doing that inconsistent relationship thing where they seem to be together and at least making out, but also acting like that's not happening at the same time.\n\n**Our Dining Table** \\- so wholesome! I love having a found family component along with the romance.\n\n**Naked Dining** \\- a little weird at first, but fun and seems like it will have good character development.\n\n**Our Skyy 2** \\- starts today, but I think I'll only watch those stories that I've seen the originals for. So I'll start with the next story since I didn't watch Never Let Me Go.",

They were so good together and had an entire backstory to explore! So many questions left hanging, so little development.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, **Love to Hate You** was decent.

Think I am going to add in The Secret Romantic Guesthouse (watched the first episode when it premiered then put it on hold) as well as Bo Ra! Deborah (haven't seen any yet) as heard good things about both of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent:\r  \n\r  \nHealer (15/20) \u2014 I am working through my list of old dramas and this one I have been meaning to start for awhile. You can definitely tell it\u2019s an older one but wow! I said last week Ji Chang Wook is a god...I am doubling down. He is so freaking good in this! They all are truthfully. This is one fine drama. I am trying very very hard not to binge it so I can savor it. \r  \n\r  \nThe Eighth Sense (6/10) \u2014 BL \u2014 Will be 8 after I watch today's episodes here shortly. Obsessed. So obsessed with this show. It\u2019s so beautiful (the cinematography and editing are gorgeous), the story is amazing, the OST is fantastic (found a new favorite band in Wetter), the tension is out of this world. I have watched each episode more times than I care to admit. I hope they can maintain that through the last episodes next week. \r  \n\r  \nThe Real Has Come (8/50) - typical makjang weekend family drama about a contract marriage. I don't normally watch these but I really am enjoying this one. I am actually watching it without subs and then rewatching with subs once Viki adds them. So much drama but it\u2019s different from everything else that I am watching, I love contract marriages, and the pacing is great. Plus watching it twice I am testing/pushing on my Korean language knowledge which is fun because I am engaged in the story. I have a very very long way to being fluent but for the most part I can gather what a conversation is about so nice way to test myself. \r  \n\r  \nCompleted:\n\nUnconventional Love Story \u2014 BL \u2014 I loved the manhwa deeply. And while I feel some flaws in the drama, especially since I believe they were trying to appeal to a general audience with it, I still enjoyed this drama. The point is about how much you are willing to do for those you love and the point of trust in a relationship. It's sweet more than deep though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNon-Korean:\r  \n\r  \nA Boss and a Babe (7/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 they are adorable! The characters and storytelling are awesome. There's little plot. Little character progression. It's just fluff and fun but this one is totally worth the time when in the mood for that.\r  \n\r  \nBed Friend (9/10) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames are so freaking good. I don\u2019t even have words for how much I love them. Last episode this weekend. This was a solid drama so long as you are watching the uncut version. The cut version cuts very important bits IMO. \r  \n\r  \nOur Dining Table (2/10) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 It\u2019s cute! Little kids and dogs make the best wingmen. Definitely a fluffy, heart felt, cute little drama with little to no angst. And they are rearranging the bread crumbs towards the coupling (vs the manga) which is lovely. And the main leads are great actors that I can not get enough of. \n\nNaked Dining (1/12) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 This one is a bit strange - a guy gets caught eating naked by what looks to be someone who had a crush on him in high school. Not sure I care about the main leads yet, but the food aspect is fun. The Japanese are so weird. Weird in a good way, absolutely, but weird as heck.",

I have now worked up to episode 40.  It has kept my interest even though the evil people just linger around and never die...and there are so many storylines that I want to fast forward sometimes.\n\nI have now watched Healer, The K2 and Lovestruck in the City.  After Empress Ki, I might start Suspicious Partners.  I watched the first episode of Backstreet Rookie and didn't like it very much.",

Though fair warning, the overall drama is not a super happy one, including the ending so definitely fit something else in between Empress Ki and it or else two sageuks in a row might be a bit much.",

In a sageuk loosely based on historical facts, the occasional bursts of synth music and rock drums is really working for me! It reminds me of both *Ladyhawke* and *Flash Gordon* (those movies had soundtracks by Andrew Powell of The Alan Parsons Project and Queen, respectively). There are those scenes in MC:TNA where one character enters in slo mo and omg the soundtrack kicks in all *duggedda-duggedda-BOOM* and it's glorious. \n\nThe OST credits \"various artists\" and I'm too lazy to shout them all out so I'll just say it's a trip and I'm liking the anachronism way more than I thought I would.",

                    "comment": "**Be Melodramatic** struck me as a very brave attempt at doing something different, but ultimately it tried too much and the atrocious pacing, especially in the last quarter, plus inconsistent storylines severely bogged it down. I also think it had too little screentime, or alternatively too many characters/plotlines, to successfully pull off what they were going for.\n\nThe show within a show framework allowed for some interesting, and at times, either hilarious or heartbreaking scenes. The way it tried to depict life and characters more realistically (including what was a rather good portrayal of a gay character imo) was refreshing indeed, and the cast was very good, but it failed for me because the writers apparently didn't realize that real life can be unsatisfying and boring. Great slice of life shows *trick you* into feeling something is realistic and that the characters might be real, but it's just a trick in the end. I don't believe trying to make the show too real at the expense of the catharsis/entertaining factor is a good way to write fiction. \n\nIn an example of their going too meta, &gt;!the last episode was pretty much a narration of the finale, rather than a real finale, while an example of trying to make it too real is Hanju revealing at the end that she got a boyfriend out of nowhere, whose existence was never hinted at before. While I suspect it was a commendable attempt to imply that characters have lives outside of what we watch, that two characters with chemistry don't always end up together because there are different kind of loves, and/or purely to subvert expectations in a shocking twist (something supported by the little troll of Hanjoo awkwardly fitting Jae-Hoon's name in during the reveal even though she could have just said \"he's younger\"), it fell flat because it sort of breaks the contract between writers and viewers that we are watching those characters' lives; even though we do not see everything, everything important to the plot should be there. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jae-hoon was also a character for whom it was never clear if he was a main character  or just a romantic interest to Hanjoo, mostly because he lacked the interconnection with the other characters you'd expect, and because his only arc (should have) finished after the second break up when it really hit both that it was over despite one last-ditch attempt to fix things, and past genuine love. That scene was really, really well-done imo, but it (ironically, considering how toxic it had been) happened way too soon compared to the number of episodes and then made him irrelevant if not for his relationship with Hanjoo. In a way he had either too much importance to the plot or too little imo. Kind of similar to Hanjoo's kid, who seemed to have an arc about dealing with his father's absence earlier on, but instead turned out to just be a brat who silently disappeared. !&lt;\n\nIt definitely had some great moments, great ideas, with a good balance of sadness and fun served by a solid cast with good cinematography. But to use \"TVTropes speak\", it ran afoul of the Law of conservation of details, Theory of Narrative Causality, and more generally Tropes are not bad too much for me to consider it as a truly satisfying watch, and I am pretty sure they had to rush things by the end.",

            "comment": "I finished **Alchemy of Souls**, I loved the first part, Mu Deok was hilarious and I loved her relationship with Jang UK. I found the magic and soul shifting very interesting. I also loved all the romance and couples. I'd give the first part 9.5* because I didn't really like the last episode and how it was left on a cliffhanger. I feel very conflicted about the second part because the characters seemed quite different to how they were in the first part, and I really missed Mu Deok. Although, I liked that there was finally a &gt;!happy ending.!&lt; I also think that if I'd watched the second part, without watching the first part, I would've really enjoyed it, but it's nowhere near as good as part one. I'd give the second season 7.5* overall I'd give Alchemy of Souls 8* because I loved the first part, but the second wasn't anywhere near as good.\n\nI also finished **She Was Pretty**. I didn't like Sung Joon at the start because I thought he was really rude, but he definitely got better within a few episodes. I'm glad I stuck with it because I ended up loving it. I found Hye Jin very relatable because I have naturally frizzy hair like hers and dry skin. I loved the supporting characters as well. Shin Hyuk was one of my favourite characters in it, he was really funny, I'm just disappointed that he &gt;!left near the end!&lt;. Overall, I loved the drama, it was sweet and funny, I'd give it 9*.\n\nI finished **Flower of Evil** as well. I liked most of it, but I found some parts of it slow and boring. It also annoyed me that &gt;!Hae Soo didn't tell Ji Won or the police that the accomplice was a volunteer at the hospital.!&lt; I thought that &gt;!Hee Sung's recovery was way too fast and unrealistic!&lt;. The only other thing that I didn't like was that &gt;!Hyun Soo had amnesia for all of the last episode, I really wanted him to regain his memories, but I'm glad there was a happy ending.!&lt; I loved the tension in the drama, and the twists were good as well. I thought the family relationship was sweet. Overall, I'd give it 7.5* because I liked it, but there were a few things that annoyed me. It also doesn't help that I expected to love it because of all the hype and high ratings, that probably gave me higher expectations than usual. \n\nI've watched a few episodes of **Tomorrow** and I'm loving it so far. I find it very interesting the way they're trying to save people and I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. It's also very emotional, the last episode I watched was the one with &gt;!the couple!&lt;, it made me cry quite a lot.\n\nI've started watching **Suspicious Partner**, it's great so far. I'm glad that &gt;!Bong Hee is free, since she's innocent. I hope they'll be able to catch the real killer and find out why they did it.!&lt;\n\nI also started watching **Grid**, but I'm a bit disappointed because from the description it sounded like it would be about protecting the earth from solar winds. But, they've already sorted it. I wasn't expecting the drama to be so crime focused. I'll keep watching it, but I was definitely expecting a scifi drama. Although, I'm interested to find out more about the woman who is able to disappear. \n\nI started watching **Nevertheless** as well. I've only watched the first episode, but I enjoyed it. So far, the only thing I don't like is the amount of smoking they're doing because I find it disgusting and it's extremely unhealthy. My dad smokes and I hate the smell of it. I like that they don't show it in most K dramas. I like all the art stuff in it, especially the butterflies. I'm hoping that I'll continue to like it because I've heard that a lot of people hated the ML.\n\nI also started watching **Island**, it seems interesting so far. The demons remind me a bit of zombies, as well as the soul shifters in Alchemy of Souls. \n\n**Non K dramas**\n\nI'm on to the 14th season of **Supernatural** and I love it. The 13th season was one of the best in a while, I found Jack very interesting, as well as the fact that there are other &gt;!worlds!&lt;. Although, I'm wondering where &gt;!Michael went, since he left Dean's body.!&lt; I'm worried about &gt;!Jack because he was coughing up blood.!&lt; I really hope it's nothing serious.\n\nI've watched the first two seasons of **911** and I love it, the stories are really interesting and I haven't seen them before in other shows. I also like that it shows the people who answer emergency calls because I'd never really thought of it from their perspective before. I can't believe the cliffhanger I was left on. &gt;!Christopher fell into the tsunami water and Buck went in after him. I really hope they'll both be okay.!&lt;\n\nI've also been watching **Station 19** and I really hope they get rid of the captain soon because he's bad at his job. He at least needs to be demoted.\n\nI'm rewatching **The Mandalorian**, before I watch the third season. I love it, Baby Yoda is so cute. I'm excited to watch the new season.\n\nI've been watching a few reality shows, **Britain's Got Talent**, **Family Fortunes**, **Gogglebox**, **In for a Penny** and **The 1% Club**. I love them all, especially In for a Penny because it's really funny, and The 1% Club because it's fun to see how smart my family and I are. I think the highest question I got right was 20% but I've got the 1% question right two or three times. It was funny because my mum got the 1% question right, but my dad didn't, and he always goes on about how smart he is. I'm looking forward to watching it again on Saturday.",

Yoo In-Na is wonderful as the high maintenance Bora and her imagined proposals were to die for. Her hapless boyfriend is hilarious. I also love her club kid sister Bo-mi. Hope this stays fun! \n\nUnlock My Boss (9/12): This is okay, littered with plot holes and I usually don't care that much about plot holes. It's fun though and an easy enjoyable watch.\n\nOnce Upon a Small Town (5/12): Awh, so relaxing! Does anything interesting happen? No but it's just what I wanted to watch right now. Thanks to all the people who recommended it to me. Low stakes, low drama, romance. If you've watched this and enjoyed it, you might enjoy the British series All Creatures Great and Small which takes place in the 1930s and it's about a big city vet who moves to the countryside. Very idyllic and it also has a nice romance, though with more angst. \n\nHit the Spot (2/8): Ummm, whoa, that opening scene!!!!! I had heard this was explicit but it's truly VERY explicit. The story is good so far and love all the aspects of female pleasure it is exploring. It's surprisingly educational, especially for young 20-somethings, older teens. \n\nReading: \nKiss Her Once For Me by Alison Cochrun: this is good so far if not immediately catching my attention. Interesting spin on the fake dating trope. \n\nWhile We Were Dating: Jasmine Guillory's books are like a warm cup of tea, so soothing and relaxing! I love to listen to her books on audio because her audio book narrator has such a fabulous voice. Love the way she says \"cup of coffee.\" If there are any romance readers out there who have recs similar to Jasmine Guillory (relaxing, low drama), I'd love to hear them. I've read all her books and I'm sad I don't have another to read.",

Deborah** (2/14) - I almost forgot about this, I'm watching it because I like Yoo In Na, but the drama didn't really hook me yet\n\nCOMPLETED:\n\n* **Call It Love** \\- i'm happy, i really enjoyed the series\n* **Our Dating Sim** \\- I really liked this. I loved the office setting and the leads, it was &gt;!such a silly misunderstanding honestly, but such is life sometimes!&lt;. The only thing I'd complain about was &gt;!the possibilty that mc might go abroad, i flipping hate my leads going abroad luckily he didn't go in the end!&lt;\n* **The New Employee** \\- omg mature-looking leads, office setting, simple but sweet story? this has everything i ever wanted. one of my favourite kbls of all times",

It's hard to explain but I was expecting something more with his character or with the plot. I would have liked to have had more information about his time in Germany and his music career. I enjoyed his scenes with the nephew.  Didn't care for the FL much. Don't know if it was the actress or the character. I did enjoy Kang Mal-Geum and the storyline with Kim Sung-Kyun, probably my favorite characters. The humor a/w Jung Moon-Sung's character didn't go over well with me and it seemed like that character could have been eliminated.\n\nStarted **Birthcare Center** (1/8)  Didn't read much ahead on this, just chose something based on the Netflix description and the fact that there are only 8 episodes. It sounded completely different from anything I'd seen, and IT IS! Only one episode in but I'm appreciating the different setting (not a law office), the humor,  and seeing unfamiliar actors.",

            "comment": "**Call it Love** (completed) - It's a new top 10 kdrama for me. It just delivered everything that I love in a slow paced melodrama in such a satisfying way. It ended perfectly and I loved that very last shot of them. It's a totally new performance that I've seen from Lee Sung Kyung and Kim Young Kwang and they pulled it off so well. The angst between the leads was so painstakingly good. I loved how they were so opposite. She's impulsive and bluntly speaks before thinking. He's rational and only speaks when needed. She's a bulldozer and he's a pushover. \n\nThe most heartbreaking moments for the ML was when &gt;!the ML tells his mom that he's never been happy because of her and then also when he tells his mom that the only time he's felt happy was with the FL. He's had major mommy issues his whole life and then finds out that he can't even have happiness with the girl he loves because of his mom's doing.!&lt; It just cuts the heart because you just want him to be happy. \n\nThe FL had such a great character development. I cried so hard watching &gt;!her tell her mom about how much she regrets everything she's done to get revenge starting from when she went to her dad's funeral because everything has hurt her so much more than made her feel better.!&lt; Another scene that I loved so much is when &gt;!she accidentally confesses her feelings about the ML to the sML. When she's yelling \"what? what wrong with me caring about him and wanting him to be happy\u201d!&lt; LSK's performance of making that declaration that turns into panicked realization was sooooo good.\n\nI really enjoyed following the story between the sML and sFL. Their friendship &gt;!turned romantic relationship!&lt; was so sweet. The sFL was such a wonderful character and her arch was so endearing to watch. It was such a great choice how the relationship between the FL and sML was so extremely platonic the whole time. I would\u2019ve hated it if it was revealed that he had feelings for the FL. \n\nI do have to say is that I absolutely did not care for the ML's ex as well as his friend. Sure, sure, redemption for the ML's ex, but their scenes seemed like fillers every time.",

Hospital Playlist 2.** I finished last week and immediately started rewatching, looking at youtube BTS, and watching the live concert video. Just a little obsessed. Right now I'm on Season 2 episode 3, so it won't be long before I'm ready to watch other things. But I am completely enthralled with this one. It's just so sensitive and heart-centered. The music is great, the stories, are great, the little deeds of kindness are great, the friends groups are great. It's shot up to my all-time favorite Top Ten group. \n\n**Gu Family Book -**  Also a rewatch for me, but this time with my long-distance kdrama-watching friend.  We are really enjoying it. Lee Seung Ki and Suzy are delightful and this one has so many little kernels of wisdom inserted. Usually they are spoke by the Admiral or the wonderful old teacher. We love him! He's played by the same actor who played Ha Ji Won's Father in **King2Hearts.** He's wonderful. \n\nFinished Part 2 of **The Glory.** I didn't really want to finish it, but I did. Lee Do Hyun is always so wonderful. I'm looking forward to the **Good Bad Mother** that will premiere pretty soon. \n\nI started the **Bo Ra** one with Yoo In Nah, but need to finish the Hospital Playlist 2 rewatch. Soon there will be some new dramas to watch. Also I want to watch Call it Love, because it has gotten a lot of Love on this r/kdrama.",

Seemed like a low-effort slightly insensitive comedy show, not my kinda thing.\n\n\n\n\nThe other day I read about Jang Dong Yoon's route to becoming an actor and wondered if he was actually any good. Saw he was in **Nokdu**, then also saw the show was on Viki - I tend to prefer their subs so decided to give it a go - worst outcome, I lose 45mins of my life.\n\n\n\nWell, I am really enjoying it! Took me by surprise, it's not the crass comedy graveyard I was expecting, it's actually fun! I must admit I don't give 2 figs about the romance side of it, but the rest is great and **Kang Tae Oh** is in it! Ever since I saw (and fell in love with) **Run On** I've adored him, so seeing him here was fantastic.\n\n\n\n\nI got to Episode 10 and thought: \"We must be getting some more of the main plot soon, there's only 6 episodes left\". Went and checked on Reddit to see what people made of it, saw... 32 episodes??\n\n\n\n\n*\"Ah, no problem! They must've split the 16 episodes in half, I've seen shows do that before.\"*\n\n\n\n\nReturn to Viki... Oh bloody hell! How am I *ever* going to find the time to finish this?? Well, too far along now :D\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**The Eighth Sense**\n\n\n\nNot gonna write much about this, but I'm loving it so far. The writing is top-tier, it's nice to see bls finally getting the same level of detail and care that other shows get. \n\n\n\nIt's gorgeously shot, well-acted, well-written, subtle, with a good supporting cast and strong leads. If you liked shows such as **Blueming**, **To My Star 2**, or even **Run On** you will probably like this",

Funny but also really humanizing for characters that were previously depicted as more one-dimensional. Not a fast paced drama at all, but not slow enough to make me drop it while I wait for more episodes to come out.\n\n**Now, We Are Breaking Up** (7/16) - Let me preface this by saying that I do not think I would be watching this if I had anything better to watch. This is the show that I find myself turning on late at night when I can't seem to find anything else. As a show, it is slow and the chemistry is weak. I do like it for the mature relationships. The leads don't break up every time someone tells them to, which I find refreshing, but it would be nice if they had some chemistry. The side characters are interesting. I'll continue watching for now.\n\nRecently completed:\n\n**True Beauty** for the second time. I needed the laughs. It also made me realize that I'm drawn to dramas where the leads have some emotional maturity.",

So, looking to continue it for now.\n\nOn the contrary, I didn't find **Bora Deborah** to be that good. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high. But for now, dropping this.",

            "comment": "I Want to Know Your Parents and Christmas Carol, both from 2022\n\nI Want to Know Your Parents 2022\r  \nSol Kyung-gu  is the principal star but there are many good performances in this one. \r  \n\r  \nI grew up poor and wearing clothes from second hand and charity shops. I went to a regular HS with a lot of rich brats \r  \nwho, though they did not hit me, there was a lot of verbal abuse and vicious rumor mongering. I never thought to tell \r  \nmy parents. Shame and pride? I don't remember why. \r  \nI mention this because I had to fast forward through the incidents of torture perpetrated by the psychopathic children in this film. I can't watch children being abused or being abusers. But maybe it's because of my own school experience.\r  \nWhether you watch those scenes or not, this film is part mystery, part psychological horror, and all thriller. \r  \nIt's basically Sol Kyung-gu's character waking up to find out his life has gone to sh\\*t and nothing about his\r  \nson is what he thought it was anymore. It's horrible to watch, but it's a very well made movie in many, many ways.\r  \nI remember watching Kill Boksoon last week and thinking I had seen Sol Kyung-gu before in something, I couldn't\r  \nremember what. It was Memoir of a Murderer. I saw that last month and he played the main character and looked like\r  \nabsolute hell. That was the first Sol Kyung-gu performance I had seen and for all I knew THAT was what the actor looked\r  \nlike. That is how good the makeup in that movie is because I could not tell he was wearing any. I hope the makeup artist team won some awards for that. Incidentally Oh Dal-su also starred with him in Memoir and was very good in it. He can be seen in this movie as well. I've seen him in several movies now and he always puts in a good performance.   \r  \n\r  \nChristmas Carol 2022\r  \nPrincipal stars are\n\nPark Jin-young, who plays twin brothers, and  Kim Young-min who portrays a counselor and teacher at a prison for young men\r  \n\r  \nLet me start off by saying Park Jin-young is great in this one. I am new to Korean films and dramas, so I haven't\r  \nseen him before, but I hope to see him in something in the future.\r  \nIt opens with a boy, Joo Il-Woo (Park Jin-young) who looks about 15 or 16 in this scene, going into prison as a new inmate. \r  \nHe looks scared, sad and pissed off, all at the same time.\r  \nThen he's in the office of a man who introduces himself as his teacher and something of a counselor. Joo Il-woo, \r  \nwe are told here, is actually 28 years old. As this teacher talks you begin to see Joo Il-woo's barely contained\r  \nrage start to emerge in his face, and because of this he gradually ages up in that scene until you believe he really \r  \nis a man of 28. It's an impressive performance.\r  \nKim Young-min is also great in this film.\r  \nI don't want to give too much away but it involves Joo Il-Woo's intellectually delayed twin brother being bullied. His brother\r  \nhas the intellectual capacity of a rather young child. It's part suspense thriller, part horror    \r  \n\r  \nBoth shows are very well acted, directed, written. It's just the subject matter that is very upsetting in both.",

But then it all went dark and menacing when Dan Dan and Chairman Lee went public with their relationship ( they were only dating ) but people went ballistic! Poor Dan Dan was locked in a room and the Chairman had tears in his eyes for a week. I don't know if Dan Dan will be taken to the U.S. with Mrs Kim but somehow I doubt it. Anyway all to look forward to.. By the way Koreans don't hug and kiss the way we do in the West. It's fascinating to watch .Full of Cultural differences. P.S. Ms Jo is rather fetching???",

Amazing technical aspects and visuals, the plot isn't new or anything but it looks gorgeous and the leads add to that, Bona's smile first and foremost. A comfy, entertaining watch.\n\nAs soon as i can I'm going to binge **Taxi Driver 2** and that's it, unless something pops out of thin air.",

Something about the laminate flooring and bedroom furniture arranged so you can see the door and the person's face in bed. Even when it's a slight odd arrangement.\n\nI noticed yesterday that the bathroom in Yeon Doo's house is supposed to be in that skinny space between the bedrooms and the entry. That can't be any wider than a person's shoulders (let alone wide enough for any bathroom fixtures!), and I just keep imagining the actors standing there between the studs waiting for their cue to come back out.",

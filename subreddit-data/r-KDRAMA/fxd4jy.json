And I think the male lead handles her interest well - once he\u2019s with the female lead, he doesn\u2019t lead the second female lead on. (So many \u201clead\u201ds in that last sentence!!)",

Rather, it's how someone might subjectively sum up a character that they didn't care for. For instance, the \"kind\" and \"charismatic\" 2nd ML that most people love, sometimes I personally might describe as \"needy\" and \"stalkerish\" and don't enjoy them as much. Many more viewers are more accepting of 2nd ML's faults and would describe it differently than 2nd FL's.\n\nAn example would be 2nd FL from Weightlifting Fairy. She had her problems and turned around at the end. Even before that turning point, however, I still thought she was a great character and interesting, with very real emotions of a person experiencing rejection, loss, frustration, and defensiveness. Some of her actions may be unacceptable, but she was a grey character with a story that was relevant to a drama about athletes and dreams, and it made me sad to see many people bad mouthing her character (and the actress) throughout the drama until a certain point. Even a 2nd FL with substance doesn't escape labeling as just another 2nd FL.\n\nEdit: Another point, all leads are often gorgeous, Yet some viewers may fawn over 2nd ML's looks, but will call a very beautiful 2nd FL ugly. We know objectively, it's not true. Filters.",

Something I noticed that probably reinforces the trope: when the male competing for the FL\u2019s attention is a jerk, they might just be listed as supporting cast, eg. SitR &amp; Queen In Hyun\u2019s Man, thus keeping the image of traditional 2MLs intact. \n\nBut sometimes when a trope is discussed, it becomes bigger than it actually is because we become hyper-sensitised to it. I reviewed my watched dramas to determine which shows didn\u2019t fit the trope and found tons. Many shows didn\u2019t even have 2FLs that competed with the FL for the ML\u2019s attention.\n\nThe 2FL in Coffee Prince was quite graceful towards the FL. That show subverted so many stereotypes it\u2019s bizarre when you realise that it aired 13 years ago, and is still a gold standard in many aspects even today.\n\nIn One Spring Night and When the Camellia Blooms, the 2MLs were, respectively, outright despicable and a low-level jerk.\n\nI did find dramas that fit the trope too but these mostly aired before 2014. I believe recent dramas are moving away from plain stereotypes towards more complex characterisations of all leads.",

As in it's something more people of either sex around the world are watching. \n\nI also see it as a kind of filtered view from the FL perspective. Like here's a show and it's basically all about this one person and you see her wishes and dreams and good and bad sides all throughout the show - but often the only time you see her interact with the 2nd FL it's a negative experience for her and that somewhat has to do with total story telling and devoted screentime to a character and their inner workings. That's assuming they are both after the same guy. When they aren't in competition there's plenty of great second FL out there.",

BTIMFL really made such good characters and the love rival of the FL was so admirable and the r/s between the FL and love rival was being understanding towards each other instead of the stupid cat fights. the scriptwriter really deserves some high praises!!!\n but thank you OP for pointing this out, i didnt even realised it myself. 2nd ML is always being the \u2018kind and giving\u2019 one while 2nd FL is always being hated on. even if you switch the roles around and have a kind and giving 2nd FL, im sure netizens will have something to complain about the 2nd FL again. as we ourselves grow more, i hope kdramas will have more representation. honestly lately dramas have really good plot as well, no longer having the stupid 2nd FL cat fights and possessive ML. thats a good improvement \u263a\ufe0f",

The second female lead starts out trying to be a typical alpha bitch, but quickly finds out (by like episode 3 of 16) that she is really bad at it and so becomes a loyal and caring friend to the protagonist, supporting her through thick and thin. \n\nCheongdamdong Alice has a good variation on the usual tropes as well. The second lead maintains a facade of animosity toward the lead, but is secretly tutoring and helping her in her goals. \n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from dramas like Successful Story of a Bright Girl where the second lead literally murdered main girl\u2019s (Jang Nara) beloved grandma (albeit, it was a hit and run that she covered up).",

But after heavy rain that caused landslide, JaeYi's family found that someone had use that lucky plot for someone named Song and found the headstone. So the rebel killed the whole family because they don't want their secret to be outed. They didn't realized JaeYi's dad had little time to write the secret letter before they killed him and hid that headstone under the fireplace.\n\nI really don't understand the gang's plan. Why even bother to write all that in the headstone and risked the secret? After 10 years hiding, their living condition is still bad (no water close by) and seems very little fighting skills learned between all of them. How would they ever could defend themselves if needed? The revenge plan is a long complicated con, instead of a straightforward plan to kill the bad guys first then kill the CP &amp; the King to put the Song baby on throne.",

But the Queen used it to lay the tombstone and the prediction for her son.   \n\n\nThe Queen was egged on by a very long range revenge. She targetted soft spots. She possibly thought she had a lot of time in hand and wanted to exert as much pain as possible until her son was old enough to take the throne. She kept the hatred for Jo family under wraps because she needed their clout to become the regent. She would then take them out one by one.   \n\n\nJay Yi's escape ruined it.",

Hwan was probably intensely relieved to get Sung On\u2019s support at the end. Which is also why he waited so long for Jay Yi, so his friend had time to come to terms with Jay Yi and Hwan\u2019s intense love for each other, to move on, even if that made him sick. Hwan kept his distance away from Jay Yi on purpose after he realized his feelings were reciprocated- something Jay Yi had seen coming, vindicating her stand of not telling Sargent earlier. Hwan\u2019s honor at the end would have forced her away from him. Hwan has been brutally trained to let his head rule over his heart so while he could not help loving Jay Yi, he could could choose what to do with his feelings (the one year ghosting of Jay Yi and his heart sick condition being the prime example).",

Unfortunately,  from the very beginning, the writers main focus was mainly on filler scenes, such as: \n\n\u2022Characters thinking to themselves but not willingly communicating...hence the almost nonexistent romance plot. \n\n\u2022Characters finding out information but not sharing it right away...hence entire episodes dedicated to each character finding out said info, and then we have to watch it being discussed and repeated at least 4xs.\n\n\u2022 We've been given villains who are an absolute joke. Therefore, we watch at least 3xs an episode of said villain cackling maniacally, crumpling paper, or giving a fish in a bowl the side eye. \n\n\u2022Episodes that were consistent in wasting camera film of the things listed above, but only spending the last 10 minutes of the episodes making something, anything happen to end it on a cliffhanger. With 20 eps, there is absolutely no excuse for the rushed ending that ep 20 will be. 100% writers fault.\n\nI'm honestly quite disappointed that the writers chose to drag out this drama when it clearly could've been a 16 ep drama. The writers were the real enemies. We'll be lucky if CP and Min Jae shake hands at the end.",

            "comment": "The last four episodes have been my absolute favourite!\n\nJust want to share my favourite things from this ep!\n\n- Lee Hwan looking so sweet &amp; dashing in that lilac purple hanbok! \ud83e\udd0d (I LOVE ANYTHING PURPLE &amp; park hyung sik)\n- I loved the final fighting scene! I totally loved Minister Han\u2019s &gt;! entrance to save the villagers, it was suave !&lt; &amp; I\u2019m glad that those episodes where the &gt;! king gave him the military stamp did not go to waste until the last ep !&lt;\n- I loved how the princess became an important part of the plot in the end, &gt;! delivering the letter to the king from the queen !&lt;  her role in the drama isnt wasted. she is soooo cute even though she is infatuated with sergeant Han, i bet she &amp; taegang would be cuter &amp; more compatible &gt;! seeing how he was so amused with her !&lt;\n- I absolutely loved in ep 19 how the king said nothing the entire few minutes yet we can get his frustration from the appeals &amp; then we see a continuation in ep 20, &gt;! that lee hwan &amp; minister han met him &amp; planned this entire thing !&lt;\n- I TOTALLY loved the 6-member joseon shields team, &gt;! didn\u2019t like that jae yi &amp; garam dressed as males tho, they probably felt safer &amp; efficient that way\u2026 !&lt;\n- THE FIGHTING SCENE was absolutely satisfying &gt;! with lee hwan, minister han, sergeant han, taegang, taesun &amp; jae yi tackling everyone. im glad it was not an anti climatic final battle !&lt; \n- i was so afraid that anyone from the shields team would die, but who else cried &gt;! when taesun admitted that he learned a lot acting a normal human being rather than an assassin interacting with lee hwan &amp; jae yi \ud83d\ude2d !&lt;\n- How did they film the twins taesun &amp; taegang? HAHAHA im just imagining he has to change &amp; do many of the same scenes \n- about the king falling in love with cho\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d, &amp; she becoming a queen, can we imply that the requirements to pick a queen is not that strict as compared to crown princess? or is that something flexible when there isn\u2019t a queen dowager or smth? \n- that being said, is it implied that jae yi can easily become the queen? not just a consort? hopefully our dashing new king has a queen &amp; get that balanced yin &amp; yang energy \n- loving how jae yi at least &gt;! get to teach kids for about a year before she moves to the palace &amp; marry lee hwan, loving how she got to live as a headmistress &amp; being an educator, at least what she wants to do as a noble unmarried lady before she commits herself to becoming lee hwan\u2019s woman with all the palace customs &amp; traditions !&lt;\n- i LOOOVE how garam still &gt;! helps jae yi and around manhyeondang, she does what she loves to do with her two masters haha &amp; love how she talked fondly in front of kim myeong jin\u2019s mother, letting her realise that what he\u2019s doing benefits a lot of people !&lt;\n- last but definitely my fav\u2026 the final scene &gt;! loving the daydream sequence from a few eps back of lee hwan imagining jae yi teaching children.. shes actually looking &amp; smiling at him in the future in contrast to reality where he asked her to go with him &amp; and the head eunuch promise (&amp; LOVE THAT FINAL BICKER), i totally cracked up and i was overjoyed over the hug &amp; kiss \ud83e\udd79it was so sweet, oh to be in love~ !&lt;\n- overall, i loved how the writers didnt miss anything about the curse &amp; mysteries &amp; murders or had useless side characters because oh boy, that will be my pet peeve in historical dramas\u2026 contrary to many ppl\u2019s beliefs, the writers wrote well \n- even though the main leads had so much tension &amp; chemistry but the romance wasnt that obvious until the last few eps, i feel like its alright to be that slow burn\u2026 life\u2019s like that &amp; its more wholesome that way, building trust &amp; friendship &amp; slowly realising that you cant live without the other\u2026 rather than just being super cringe romantic which can be hard for me to watch when you get too much of that\u2026",

            "comment": "I wish...\n\nThere had been a&gt;! flashback to a more detailed reunion scene between Jae Yi and the CP - even if brief - after they busted her out of prison. I thought their relationship deserved at least that much attention !&lt;\n\nThat Jae Yi and CP had been able to&gt;!fight together, back to back or side by side in the final battle. They had been through so much through the whole series, but in the final pivotal fight scene, they were apart which really bothered me. And Jae Yi's martial arts are on kick-ass level so she wouldn't have been a burden. I mean... she even disarmed a soldier to arm herself, and I was hoping to see her cleave and chop her way to CP's side!&lt;\n\nThat CP and Cacklemaniac's &gt;!fight scene was longer - it was so short! But damn, that guy could ninja-throw a broken blade!&lt; \n\nThat it ended &gt;!with the four of them meeting up again, at the Shield hideout, because another Strange Situation had come up, and only they would be able to solve it. Onward to another great adventure!!&lt;\n\nMy final score: &gt;!9/10 for the scenes with PHS and JSN together because they had such great chemistry and had so many cute moments together. They really deserved a better vvehicle. 6/10 because the writing and editing for the plot fell apart under its own weight, especially as we neared the end.  !&lt;\n\nI became a big fan of Jeon So Nee in this series - had seen her in Rage, Scripting your Destiny and Encounter, and I look forward to catching her in Parasyte and with Kim Da Mi in their movie together. \n\nThanks to everyone here who was great company through these 20 episodes, you made my lurking very enjoyable and it was fun to read through the chatter :)",

She did that  to drive a wedge between sergeant and CP. She was betting that the sergeant would feel resentment toward CP, and he did, but he valued the friendship more. She purposely gave the poisonous drink to the sergeant, believing that he would willingly give it to CP for being the direct cause of his families loss of position and rank, and CP also didn't tell him he was hiding his fiance.\n\nThe Right State Minister was the mastermind behind having the sergeants father removed from his position.  He told the sergeant that he would reinstate his father to his former position if he killed CP. The RSM is counting on the sergeant wanting to be able to restore his dad position and family rank. Family status was huge back then, and people would do just about anything to avoid a scandal or restore family honor.",

                    "comment": "Absolutely beautiful summary.   \n\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect of this last episode, but it filled the heart. It was so different and so meaningful. At the end, you can't help but feel for the Queen and her final sacrifice for her people. I do wish we had seen a little bit more of her as well. But still, contrary to what I thought, nothing, absolutely nothing felt rushed.   \n\n\n&gt;!Action rather than words - Hwan would have broken Jay Yi out of prison, irrespective, that was a given, but the entire underplaying of their meeting after her rescue was interesting. The way they sat together around the fire could not have been more telling (they were almost glued to each other) but it was almost had the feel 'we are at work'. !&lt;\n\nThe extreme lack of physical display of their affection made their final union beautiful, almost tearful. I could not but help swallow the lump.   \n\n\nI do wish they had shown Hwan's coronation - the way he always looked at Jay Yi before taking an important step in his life would have been beautiful.   \n\n\n&gt;!He brought the palanquin for Jay yi that was decorated with bridal fittings, signifying he was taking her in as his wife. \"This is my answer\", says he, looking straight at her. By this time, their love probably had become a folklore - the woman for whom the Prince gave up his crown. So the entire palace was already rooting for them (as evidenced even by the enuchs who earlier had made Go Sun Dol's life miderable). The fact that the Prince, with his actions, did so much for her when she needed it the most, yet did not rush in to fulfill what his heart must have desired earnestly when things settled down, instead choosing to get to work to make life for everyone else better, at the expense of his own, raised his and Jay yi's esteem in everyone's eyes. !&lt;  \n\n\nCould some things done better? Sure. By only gripe is, the letter being sent to Jay Yi's family was never truly resolved. Or maybe I missed it? Why, at the end, did the Queen send something so incriminating and then have them murdered at the same time? Maybe they two were separate incidents, the letter being their way of spreading the cursed ghost letter story through Jay Yi's brother, but eventually their hand might have been forced by the sudden discovery and disspearance of the tomb stone? Especially when the ghost letter was burned anyway? The letter must have already been on its way when the tombstone went mising and the dispatch of the jigumdedo happened. So could be that while the ghost letter was on its way, the tombstone went missing, The monk made Shim Young give Jay Yi the bracelet and planned to kill the family.\n\nI wonder why the Queen didn't feed the entire Jo clan those fish eggs right off the bat.....possibly she understood she needed their power to get the kid to the thone? Possibly for the same reason she didn't outright made Hwan crazy (noteworthy - she didn't also kill the first crown prince). So she might have thought she had more time in hand, maybe another decade, and made plans for revenge that made her as bad as the people who destroyed her life. Jay Yi's escape changed all that.  \n\n\nTerrific series. Going to watch it again.",

The letter thing is actually not that unclear if we watch it in continuity (I realized we drop a lot when waiting for our weekly episodes).  \nEpisode 12 at the end, it's evident:  \nThe rain has caused the mudslide.  \nThe family has gone there to inspect damage. So this is when her father discoveres the stone, and writes the jikkemdedo immidiately and sends it on its way (which Ga Ram sees).  \nThe herald arrives on the day of the murder, so he probably came with instructions to Shim Young who was already under influence of the monk to kill the family and make it look like the ghost letter had something to do with it. Possibly they thought the governor would save it to show it to the son later (they only saw Jay Yi interacting with her father, not aware she was the actual investigator and not her brother). Once the family was dead, the ghost letter contents could easily be spread. But Jay Yii and her father reading it before the murders, burning it, and Jay Yi being upset and not eating changed the course of their history.   \nOnce the Governor reads the letter, as soon as he gets poisoned, he adds the two plus two and before dying he realizes people are targeting the Crown Prince and asks his daughter to protect the Crown Prince. He did not have enough time to warn her about the Jigemdo he sent to his friend unfortunately.   \nHence, the idea probably was to murder the entire family, and then blame it on the ghost letter through Shim Young- the eventual target being further mental breakdown of the Crown Prince who would be the only one to know he had, indeed, written such a letter though he never sent it.  \nThe Crown Prince would always wonder how it got to his master's house - further proving it was indeed a ghost who was punishing him. He would be the only one who would be terrified at the thought he might have caused his friend's fiancee, and his master's family to die, in line of the curse - \"he would cause the death of so many people because of his 'foolishness\" - in this case, daring to write to his master about his ghost letter. One chip at a time to his immense fortitude. It would be hard to overcome something this traumatic even for someone like Hwan.  \nIt was in line with what the story always was - to drive Yi Hwan crazy with terror and loneliness, with things only he knew. At this rate the batshit crazy queen might not have even needed those fish eggs.  \nJay Yi at the end does protect him, as he protects her.",

His court lady saw the crumpled up drafts. If the ghost\u2019s letter was discovered with their deaths, curse would be known and maybe the deaths would have been blamed on the CP?

He's literally the most innocent person in the entire palace, he must have been like 12 when the rebellion happened, so why go after him? Shouldn't the Queen go after the King, who gave the order? Or her uncle, who actually killed the villagers? Why the Prince? It makes no sense.\nAlso why did JaYi confess to the crimes? It ended up being useless anyway, she's always doing this \"everything is because of me\" nonsense when she's barely a pawn in the story other than the viewers seing it unfold from her point of view, it's very frustrating.",

The ultimate revenge would be for the king to lose both his biological sons and have his youngest son become the CP, only find out that his youngest son isn't even his son at all (he'd probably find all this out right before being assassinated). No doubt, this would be the Queens' ultimate revenge against the King, to wipe out his bloodline, take away everything he's known.  Just as he gave the orders to wipe out her hometown, the only place she'd known, her husband and fellow townspeople were wiped out by the king. It's basically an eye for an eye. The king took everything from her, and now she's going to take everything from him. Only, I'm not sure if she knows her \"uncle\" was behind the massacre and just solely blames the king.",

Also, the next episode's gonna be a very fast paced one, they have to show soo much in such a short span. The writers to keep audience engaged took the entire plot to just last few episodes. &gt;!Also, as you said, CP is the most innocent person, maybe that's why they targeted him. They needed someone to take the blame of the rumor who poisoned the prev CP. Just one thing tho, how has the queen not yet figured out who were really behind the rebellion if she's working on the case for 10 yrs with such precision. As for Jaeyi, she did that to save the prince and herself because if she defended herself things may go very dirty for both of them and they won't be able to carch the real culprit. How Jaeyi's father got to know about Song's tombstone, how did the Queen enter the palace when she literally had no one within a month, why Jaeyi wasn't murdered (maybe to target her but still we haven't got this from the show), why they gave the ghost letter to the prince's master when he was going to be killed immediately, how and how not are the rsm and the queen involved with each other, there are just too many questions and we want some romance atleast from the last episode they've got to be kidding me. Now that to crown princess is dead, I soo want Jaeyi to be the princess when things get resolved in the last episode. Tbh, after watching the preview of 20th episode I feel we're still a little far from the ending and there was no sign of things getting finally unfolded; if we get 1 or 2 special episodes/extended episodes it's gonna be fire but who knows what's in the writers mind. Let's pray for a non messy happy ending.!&lt;",

Jaeyi's dad and the tombstone was because of the rains that had washed away the earth in the period right before they were killed, they realized there was a tombstone/burial site where the one reserved for the King should be. He wrote the coded letter then. The Queen made a deal with the RSM and he smuggled her in pretending she was someone else from his own family and the family, who were all corrupt jerks, agreed to back him up. He knew she was a courtesan but thought he would kill people at the first night he met her and she was dancing before the King and the then Crown Prince so he then pushed for her to be queen.",

Once the older CP died, she probably developed a hatred for Hwan and set the bloody things in motion.

PHS\u2019s eyes say it all.\n\nthe character i was most grateful for this episode is\u2026 the guardian warrior (!). that comes as a surprise to me seeing the turn he took a couple of episodes ago, and i still feel that the strangulation incident was too readily swept aside. &gt;!however, after putting his trust in the crown prince, he gathers his most dependable men and saves jae yi from execution. jae yi remains true to character throughout, never failing to put up a fight, but is also evidently (eventually) grateful for his running off with her; the brushing of dirt from his clothes is sign of a truce between the two. though i doubt whether it signals an end to their bickering. i shouldn\u2019t have laughed at the guardian warrior\u2019s impersonation of her (sorry jae yi!), but his change of voice was so unexpected that i couldn\u2019t help but find humour in it.!&lt; so thank you, guardian warrior, for bringing some much needed levity to this episode. \n\n&gt;!seeing the shield investigation team (with the additions of the no-longer-barred-from-entry sergeant and the proven-his-loyalty guardian warrior) reunited at the end made me so happy i teared up. there\u2019s just something special about a group of friends who always have each other\u2019s backs, and who each play a part in ensuring the success of the mission. i\u2019ll be heartbroken if any of them die in the finale, but between now and tomorrow evening i\u2019ll hold onto the fact that all signs are pointing towards a happy ending. despite the chaos and the evil doers, episode 19 felt hopeful \u2014 how can the shield investigation team fail when each member is so loyal to the cause and adept at what they do?!&lt;\n\none thing i remain uncertain about is how jae yi could possibly be happy as the crown princess, if that is what\u2019s destined for her. however, this drama has been very good at subverting both the expectations of its audience and the social norms of the time in which it\u2019s set. what wouldn\u2019t surprise me is if it found a way for min jae yi to stay by the side of the man she loves (and who loves her in return) while retaining the freedom (to leap over walls, speak her mind, exercise her intellect, and fight to protect others) that she\u2019s become accustomed to, and which are all her right.",

                    "comment": "Long post alert: Hwan and Jay Yi - the need for 1 year gap:  \n\n\nIn the last scene, we see that Hwan brings the palanquin for Jay yi that is decorated with bridal fittings, with his Royal insignia emblazoned on it, signifying he is taking her in as his bride, which is a beautiful ode to the bygone eastern culture (A man taking a family palanquin to a woman\u2019s house in braod day light always meant marriage \u2013 the royal insignia being the key here). \u201cThis is my answer\u201d, says he, looking straight at her. Her overwhelming emotional, wordless response says it all, though her sas comes right out the next moment, giving a glimpse of how their relationship has not only grown stronger while they were apart, and she was still going to be the Jay Yi he loved so much, King or not (the way he sweetly backs down is so cute \u2013 reminded me of their fight scene when she rolls her sleeves and Hwan literally ducks back). The blooming of her heart in his was complete (Hyung Sik\u2019s OST seals the deal here \u2013 words are not necessary, there is no tomorrow without you).  \nHwan is nothing if not meticulous. He never does anything half measure. He is the man who would open path for a woman blocked by a high wall. His strength is thinking out of the box. He had already gambled everything he had as a Crown Prince to keep her by his side as an eunuch. Being all or nothing man that he is, to get Jayi back by his side (and into that beautiful little library palace), he would have kept no stone unturned.  \n\n\nIt's true that he would have to:  \n\n\nWait for the political dust to settle down  \nGrow into the role of a ruler that didn't come easy to him  \nGive Sung Ho enough time to move on  \nGive Jay Yi time to live her life as she wished, and at the same time make an informed choice of accepting Hwan and all the limitations that come with being his Queen. It's all about giving her choice. She knew he liked her, she knew he was invested in her friendship, but she didn't truly know he deep his love for her went (hence the apology for being disrespectful and rude to him till the end - what a line!). Which is why his silence when they meet again makes so much more sense on the hindsight.   \nTurn the tide for Jay Yi who was ridden with scandal and rumors before bringing her back in with full honors.   \n\n\nWhat might happened meanwhile?  \nBy this time, their love probably would have become a legend \u2013  \n\\# the Prince who gave up his crown for the woman he loved (afterall they would only remember his jaw dropping request for deposal \u2013 a declaration of love already spreading like wildfire in the palace \u2013 optics matter),  \n\\# the woman who chose to go to gallows instead of letting her Prince get trapped by his enemies  \nHow do you think the the royal physician even dared to broach the subject of lovesickness \u2013 it must THE story of the palace at this point where even the royal chopsticks know about Hwan and his pining for a certain lady who they only saw dressed as an Eunuch (oh that was totally hilarious, a brilliant scene by all counts). The Court ladies and the Eunuchs probably have had a field day discussing this for the entire year once the truth came out. It can be safely assumed the palace was already rooting for them (as evidenced even by the enthusiasm of the enuchs who earlier had made Go Sun Dol\u2019s life miserable). The fact that the Prince, with his actions, did so much for her when she needed it the most, yet did not rush in to fulfill what his heart must have desired earnestly when things settled down, instead choosing to get to work to make life for everyone else better, at the expense of his own, raised his and Jay yi\u2019s esteem in everyone\u2019s eyes.  \nInterestingly, the King already flouted the rules to get Hwan married to the girl of his choice, hence the erswhile monarch would have little reason not to give his blessing to the girl who his son loved so much, and whose family literally saved the royal family.  \nMy theory is, in this one year, while giving Sung On enough time to move on, as well as give himself time to grow as a ruler, and give Jay Yi time to taste the independence she so craved so she could eventually make an informed choice, he probably declared the virtuousness of Lady Min Jay Yi in court by recounting everything she and her family did and how she would need to have her full honors restored. Heck, the ministers probably even mused had she been a man she would have been offered a post and many valuable offerings like land and slaves, so restoring her honor was the least they could do.  \nThen he probably called on the scholars to make sure they would not have any issues if he chose a Queen of his own choice. The smart Jo scholar would even read the air in the room and correctly advise him that as a king, he could write royal edicts about how he would choose his own Queen. (Josean kings randomly flouted rules when it came to their women anyway).  \nNext, he would have approached the Han family to gain support on doing away with the ridiculous two parent rule. Considering Han family itself almost perished because of that rule, they would be more than happy to go around it and get unanimous support on it. This definitely does look like something that would easily pass. The court at this time would be in total awe of Hwan \u2013 getting two most powerful ministers from the most powerful family in the country torn to pieces and many others decimated would have instilled a great fear and respect for Hwan as a ruler, and they would not be any frame of mind to oppose Hwan in a hurry, especially when the three most powerful court ministers, and by default everyone in their camp, backed Hwan to the fullest (they were a afterall a huge part of the funny petition of the inner court beging their King to hurry to a certain school down the road).  \nPlus the fact that Jay Yi would practically be stepping into the late Han Crown Princess shoes because she would always be backed by the powerful Han family who are forever indebted to Jay Yi and Hwan for saving them, that too for a long time to come, given Sung On\u2019s unwavering promise to protect both Min Jay Yi as well as Hwan, it\u2019s evident Hwan has successfully made the inroads needed to bring her in as a Queen.  \nWhat I do think is Jay Yi didn\u2019t expect the bridal palanquin with his insignia stamped on it, screaming to anyone who cared that he was taking his one and only Queen-to-be home if she would have him. It\u2019s interesting how she always waited for him in the evening, or at night, on the steps, and never expected him during the day, fully reconciled to whatever role she would have in his life so she could just be by his side, hence the surpirse on her face when he did turn up in broad daylight with the royal palanquin.That\u2019s why his gentle nudge, a beat where he held his hand out to her, and her momentary hesitation before she accepted it, signified his wordless promise to her to trust him to do the right by her was so meaningful. I wish that scene had lasted well into their travel to palace (and possibly him putting her up in the Eastern Palace where the sun rises) but I will take it as the scenes I have for both of them post their arrival at the palace in my head look so good.",

Be like Right Minister Cho, allow the people of Byeokcheon and Crown Prince to die, and wait for her son to take control before punishing anyone\n2. Come clean to the King, attempt to save the people of Byeokcheon, and face punishment from the king for deceiving him and for her acts \n3. Come clean to the King, attempt to save the people of Byeokcheon, and punish herself \n\nGiven the blood on her hands, and her guilty conscience of almost choosing her child before anyone else, she opted for option 3, to save the people she started this for and to repent. She swallowed the magic fish's eggs, and fulfilled the last part of the curse: walking to the ends of the earth, alone and mad. \n\nShe knew that her son would be in danger and at the mercy of others irrespective of the choice that she made, so I am choosing to believe that she chose the option that would grant her son the best chance at survival and at sympathy from the King and Crown Prince. But tbh, she really had no alternative where she could have made it out unscathed, since there was enough evidence to convict her of her wrongdoings.",

In other dramas, a few Queens were exiled to other palaces in the Kingdom.  It seemed like the King cared about her, but why just kick her out with no shoes or anything? !&lt;",

And eventually it broke his heart so bad he became sick, giving away his throne to his son. \n\nWho, it turns out, was equally love sick and suffering. \n\nThe men of this family apparently cannot live without the women they love. \n\nThis does have a lot of material for a sequel I\u2019d they even wanted. Judging by how deeply Hwan is in love with Jay Yi, he would never have eyes for anyone, which, politically could be dangerous for Jay yi as people would want her out, so they could install their women in the palace. Plus the fact that there is a shield team that could investigate stuff. While I don\u2019t have high hopes (as none of the actors might want yo give another year to film in some very uncomfortable settings), still it would have been nice.",

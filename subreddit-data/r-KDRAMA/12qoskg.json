And the sexual harrassment that went unpunished!\nAnd also the awful soundtrack.\n\nHave been thinking about the separation trope..\nHonestly it totally kills the romance for me. If one decides to split and not contact the other. Thats it, theyre dead to me and im unforgiving of the excuses they give when they want to reunite with the other \ud83e\udd23\n\nIn SITR I get that he wanted to take her away from the work and family drama but she had to see it through.\nBut I thought they could have compromised if they really honestly loved eachother. \n\nBut the last drama I just finished, i found the second guy in the triangle kind of yuck. When the ML leaves for overseas and dumps the FL, even though I found SL repulsive I started rooting for him and got SLsyndrome in last episode when of course ML swoops back in. The separation trope needs to be carefully done imo.",

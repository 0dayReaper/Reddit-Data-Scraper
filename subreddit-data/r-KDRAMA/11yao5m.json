                    "comment": "I need someone from Korea to explain this \"camping\".  Is this kdrama camping really how it is in Korea?\n\nIn Canada most of the time it would be either \"car camping\" where your site is directly accessible by car or RV or \"back country camping\" where you are either hiking or canoeing or taking a quad into an isolated site miles from your car.  Kdramas present a huge amount of gear even for car-camping yet they don't seem to be by their car.  They seem to have a platform or a mowed lawn to camp on with a nicely maintained path to it.  They always seem to have an incredible amount of gear once set up but I don't ever see them hiking in with huge packs or anything.\n\nBut what gets me is that they always seem to be camping cheek-by-jowl with other campers.  In this episode, he had his gear stored under a tarp on a lovely secluded platform but then he evidently moved it to where the other campers were because once it was set up they are on the lawn surrounded by other campers!  To my way of thinking, I always want to be as far away from other campers as possible, why would they move it?  It doesn't even make sense from a TV production economics sense as you could have avoided all those extras by having them camp on that secluded platform where the tent was stored (what the hell, how could the uncle afford to leave a campsite unused for 3 years?)\n\nAnyways,  kdramas are presenting a version of camping that I guess might be their version of car-camping? where you don't have a drive-in camp site? and where the campground provides all the gear and the tents? Is that how it works in Korea?",

There are RV hookups, large facilities, restaurants, dining halls, indoor plumbing, etc. There are also regular campsites with portable restrooms and showers.\n\nHere is a key [passage](https://www.nemoequipment.com/blogs/journal/jungki-go-far-jeju-island) I read:\n\n&gt;Camping culture in Korea is quite unique, and when we got to the second campsite, I was reminded of the differences between there and the U.S. In Korea, camping isn't about going deep into the mountains or staying in areas with no phone signal, water, or lights. People in Korea want to relax in nature, but they don't camp in remote places where they can't easily get everything they need.\n\nAnd regarding what you said about why people seem so close together at camp sites:\n\n&gt;Foreign visitors should bear in mind that Koreans have always been very group-oriented. Campers often arrive in groups and frequently include drinking and singing as part of their experience. Expect noisy neighbours during high season and don't be shocked by loudspeakers and whistles at 7 a.m.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Few Koreans camp alone or in pairs, and you will very certainly be requested to participate in activities, eating, and drinking as a foreigner. Do not be afraid! You'll gain knowledge about Korea and build a vacation to remember for both you and your hosts.\n\n[http://www.koreners.com/bbs/board.php?bo\\_table=blog&amp;wr\\_id=2909&amp;ckattempt=1](http://www.koreners.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=blog&amp;wr_id=2909&amp;ckattempt=1)",

The show seems to be about grieving and what approach you take to it. Dong Jin gets quiet and takes the beating, while Woo Joo and President Shin take revenge. At the end of the day, both approach prove to be wrong and the person taking them are worse off. \n\n- Dong Jin character development! He shouted, he joked, he ran and more importantly he went camping! I do wish Woo Joo's little bro lived with him a little longer...\n\n- Good job to Hye Sung. Her coming out of her shall and opening up was great to see.\n\n- I low-key want Joon to just be friends with both girls. There is something very poignant about the lonely guy who just wants to be a family member of three dramatic siblings.",

            "comment": "I think/hope this week's episodes were the calm before the storm regarding WJ and DJ's relationship. &gt;!Early on I expected them to get together and give us some fluff before the explosive revelation happened, but I don't think WJ is the kind of person to enter a relationship under false pretences, especially after seeing how much she struggled with her guilt/sadness in these latest episodes. Now that DJ seems to have resolved to put the past behind him and like WJ wholeheartedly (which he never stated outright, granted\u2014but I think his state of mind is obvious), he's not going to let her keep blowing hot and cold with no explanation. Also the siblings' mother is in town, Jigoo is going to go back to DJ's flat to pick up his stuff, Joon is losing patience with WJ and DJ, etc. It just feels like the inevitable blowup is now imminent.!&lt;\n\nThat's why these two episodes felt like they were laying the necessary groundwork for the real drama to come, &gt;!with DJ resolving his feelings about MY and their breakup once and for all and getting pretty obvious about his interest in WJ. So despite WJ's private angst these episodes didn't strike me as particularly intense for the main couple, outside of the hospital sequence. (And can I just say, it was great to see DJ angry on WJ's behalf. Her getting hurt seemed like a pivotal moment for him; he forgot the stupid mind games he and WJ had been playing when it happened and never wavered thereafter.)!&lt;\n\nJoon and HS, on the other hand, had their most charged moments so far. &gt;!We finally learned that HS is suffering from anxiety/PTSD/panic attacks/something like that because of the hair-pulling episode. I actually thought her heart-to-heart with Suho was really touching and finally planted some sincerity in their relationship... but then he went and did what he did and ruined it.!&lt; On that note, Suho is a well drawn character IMO; he shows flashes of real decency and sweetness but also has some staggeringly thoughtless moments when he's not even aware of what a prick he's being. I think these contradictory traits make him quite lifelike and realistic as an average kind of guy who still has some growing up to do. Also correct me if I'm wrong, but the friend he was talking to was Jigoo, right?\n\n&gt;!In any case, I think when HS sought comfort in Joon I caught some hints that he may be (becoming) aware of his feelings for her...?!&lt; I was wondering if he even liked her because while they've always been an entertaining duo, Joon never seemed particularly interested in HS. He keeps his cards very close to the chest, so I wasn't sure if he was harbouring a deeply repressed crush or genuinely didn't have any feelings for her. &gt;!But as I said, I think their hug might have given him away.!&lt;\n\nFinally, can I just say I love Ms Baek? She's good at her job, nice, observant and prudent enough not to make a clown of herself trying to interfere (cough Sunwoo cough). I'd say she'd be a much better fit for SW than MY, but I honestly think she's too mature for him and probably has an equally high-achieving and thoughtful partner waiting for her at home. That said, while I rag on SW, I liked his stupid faces at WJ and the line that DJ should be in love even if he's not dating because the weather is too nice did put me in a springtime mood.\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that Woojoo\u2019s choice of wide off-white trousers as her camping outfit was hilarious.",

She\u2019d be so good for SW, but you\u2019re right she\u2019s probably too good for him.\n\nIn another drama I could actually ship Suho and Hye Sung. His speech about her was great, him responding to her genuineness and pointing out her faking was great, his instinct to stay and sympathise with her was great. I do wonder if, being younger, he sees less stigma in mental illness and can casually discuss it more. That said, of course it was thoughtless and unkind of him (I do think he was talking to Jigu and wonder if Jigu will be mad on his sis\u2019s behalf), but Hye Sung wooing him to make herself feel better could easily have hurt him too. They\u2019re both flawed and I love it - and she\u2019s more mature because she IS more mature, but I could see how they could make it work. \n\nMind you, I don\u2019t ship it because in this drama is Jun, our funny lonely angel with big hands to wrap around a lady\u2019s waist and an obviously deeper emotional connection on both sides. \n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see a lamp lit in DJ - even a self doubting man can tell if she takes a rock to the head for you and clings to your hand in the hospital, she\u2019s in! I also liked him saying to her: no fronting necessary, my door is OPEN. It\u2019s the way she knows how to love and be loved (with her sibs and Jun) and the way he wants to be loved.",

In Dong Jin\u2019s case, Kim Young Kwang does a beautiful job at acting SO WHIPPED FOR HER I honestly feel like crying each time he looks at her. KYK did say in an interview he believes being in love is when is when you smile at every little thing someone does, and I adore seeing him portraying that in this show. Dong Jin also had rekindled his love for camping by sharing that experience with Woo Joo, which reflects the notion that when you\u2019re in love, you just want to share all the things you find beautiful with that person\n\n\u2022 Woo Joo may have a prickly demeanor on the exterior, but there have been so many times she has said something to Dong Jin that was kind of\u2026 sweet? \u201cYou won\u2019t go down, \u201cI want you to live the most comfortable life\u201d \u201cDo what your heart tells you to\u201d and the fact that her character is so brutally honest sometimes makes these lines even sweeter because you know they are genuine. \n\n\u2022 The symbolism. Woo Joo wearing less baggy clothes as she realizes her feelings. The pink filter less prominent as the series progresses. Pink filter isn\u2019t as much of a nuisance anymore now that I know there may be an intention behind it lol \n\n\u2022 Dong Jin\u2019s character development also took a big leap on this one and it was so satisfying \n\nI\u2019m crying at my lunch break at work right now and  my heart feels as if it\u2019s about to explode. Ugh the wait till Wednesday is going to feel so excruciatingly long!",

She finally opened up to someone about it which was a very hard thing to do and he was just on the phone talking about it as if it was nothing. This is such an accurate and appreciated portrayal of how some parts of society can be dismissive and not mindful towards what some may go through no matter the depth of the struggle.",

            "comment": "Both episodes were great and filled with some really nice moments. \n\nThe 3 main office employees discussing / hand waving them dating was so cute.\n\nThere were so many parallels in the conversations, Woojoo encouraging him to stand up for himself and only doing things if he wants to. You can see the instant and also lasting effect it has in him.\n\nWoojoo lashes out at him like she often does. In return Dongjin hurts her feelings because he\u2019s hurt by her.\n\nI really liked Dongjin starting to understand Woojoo better day by day. When he tells her to come over when she wants to instead of making excuses, she hesitates but very quickly confirms that she will. And then says \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting\u201d Perfect. Basically repeating what she told him, to do things if and when he wants to.\n\nWoojoo continues to use a softer voice with him when her walls are down. And then instantly turns cold when she\u2019s back to being defensive. Dongjin is frustrated by her mood swings and they actually discuss it openly in the show. \n\nMaybe Woojoo will see how blind revenge is not healthy after getting hit. She even says that she could have probably dodged it but she chose to try and end it then and there.\n\nLastly the biggest supporting aspect of this show is the background music. The way it swells or calms down is so good. Like when Dongjin wants to meet her and while she is downstairs she refuses to, after reading the message, the music instantly calms down and he puts his phone away.\n\nEdited to add: I forgot to mention that I loved Jigu understanding just how much burden Woojoo takes upon herself.",

In general I like it when my shows are just sunshine and rainbows lol, I hate it when the premise of a show is just the lead suffering. But I think they managed to create a very melancholic tone without making it feel overly depressing.\n\nMaybe it's because rather than having the characters experiencing hardship after hardship, it's more about them living lives that are devoid of any joyful feelings.\n\nI think that's why I feel like there's something very beautiful about this drama. Because the baseline emotional tone is rather... grey. It really makes the small moments where things look up for the leads stand out.\n\nAlso really liking the music, it's somber but also hopeful in a way.\n\nEdit:\n\nEp 10\n\n&gt;!OMG them holding hands was so CUTE!!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!AHHH Dongjin telling Woojoo she could come anytime she wanted and that he'd be waiting OMGGGGGGG!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I loved seeing the older sis opening up and being honest about her feelings to her bf. This whole time they've been on different wavelengths, so I liked the honest conversation they had. And he seemed really understanding so I was gonna root for them... until I heard his phone call with his friends. I feel so bad for the sis :(!&lt;\n\nALSO! From episode 9, &gt;!when Dongjin got angry with Woojoo and walked away, I noticed that he stopped by the crossroad even though it was still green. At first I thought he just did it mindlessly, but at the end it looked like he actually was waiting for her to come after him and was disappointed when she didn't.!&lt;",

Maybe it is me, but in most of the kdramas I watch I usually have this question of how/why do they like each other..many of the stories just glosses over this step, and are about them winning each other back after breaking up, or somehow the moments they cross over to liking each other is not that clear to me..and it is ok..in real life we probably cannot explain when/how/why we like someone..but I really appreciate how this series shows us the specific moments they are touched by..and make us somehow feel it too..like I don't have to postulate their feelings just because the two characters are the leads, or the actors have good chemistry. I love this about the story telling, and how the actors portrayed it..",

            "comment": "If anyone has read/watched Little Women (not the kdrama), do you guys see a slight parallel? This is like what if the same characters in the book came out of a broken home. \n\nFL reminds me of Jo, the main character in the book... and her best friend was Laurie who loves the family but also thinks he loves Jo. And Jo is independent and rebellious and falls in love with this rather out there professor whom she feels protective over and cares for.\n\nI love that they haven't made this a love triangle for the FL. That she has a best friend who fundamentally cares for her and whose discomfort over her love life might not stem from a romantic jealousy but just concern over whether there will still be space for him in her life. \n\nI love the older sister who seems like this flighty character but really there is so much more to her than her bubbliness. And that she is like those insects that burrow into wood or something... she has been quietly making her way into Jun (the best friend's) heart.\n\nAnd I love the youngest brother who listens to his middle sisters' worry and instead of pooh-poohing it or getting angry with her for having expectations that he does not want a part of, he decides to compromise to reduce at least a part of her burden. That really touched my heart. I think I might have not had his maturity or compassion.\n\nFinally, the ML... sigh... I need to keep reminding myself that he is fiction but he is such eye candy.  But also this episode I realized that he is a little weirder than most other men or even the man in my own life. My guy is always asking about what's happening in my life. But he never really asks her. \n\nHe never asks her why she tailed him in the beginning... or why she has taken such an interest in him. He just accepts all this wonderful support she gives him and hardly gives back. I feel like smacking him now. \n\nLike, can't you see something is up with her. She walks just like you... like a skinny eeyore with her own personal rain cloud. Shouldn't you be wondering why she is so careful and guarded and even prickly? Do you only like her when she is propping you up? Can you prop her up?\n\nI hope the second half is about her finding her way up now... because the end of episode 10 really hurt. I felt like it's really high time that she gets to start her healing. Cause she was distracted all this time but not healed.",

            "comment": "Such a gorgeous drama. I'm so glad I decided to watch this. It's the best thing I'm watching right now. And I believe that it's the best K-drama Disney+ has made so far.\n\nWhile both leads are just so... heartbreaking and so great... have to give special attention to Dong-jin's transformation.\n\n1. Saw Min-yeong on the street and followed her. She hid from him.\n2. When Min-yeong approaches him, he told her coldly that she should not show herself to him, ever.\n3. Gives Min-yeong fever medicine and tells her he will have a drink with her when she gets better. Such kind words have never been so cutting. (Girl, I am over you.)\n4. His dour expression looks like he is dying in the 1st 8 episodes of this show. Grins like a little boy when going camping with Woo-joo. IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.\n\nI mean, look at the simple show poster. A man and a woman gazing at each other. Before the show began, that looked so boring. Looked just like every other romance story poster. But after seeing the show, it looks so heartbreaking and HOT. Woo-joo is wearing yellow. That looks practically revolutionary.\n\nYes, so far it's been about Dong-jin healing. He's not really looking after Woo-joo's feelings yet. But we have no doubt that he will be there for her, very soon. He will be her rock. I cannot wait.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nThe one thought that I consistently have while watching this show is how emotionally intelligent the script is. I really \\*feel\\* every feeling.\n\nJoon calls Hye-seong \"Mok-seong.\" Hye-seong = comet, and Mok-seong = Jupiter. I don't remember how this joke between them started, though.\n\nMy prediction is that the mother of the 3 siblings (Hyeon-ju) won't object to Woo-joo's romance with Dong-jin. (I mean, she won't be happy about it. But I don't think she will forbid it.) The primary reason being that she knows her kids and knows that Woo-joo wouldn't jump into a romance lightly. I also suspect that she is rational enough to understand that the misdeeds of adults shouldn't penalize their kids. It's also possible that she knows something about Dong-jin, since his mother was her classmate. She may know that his mother, Hee-ja, is awful, but her child is decent. It's just my speculation/hope.\n\nI think Hee-ja is the biggest obstacle of all. She is an absolute nightmare of a person. When young Woo-joo jumped in front of her father's car, her father was panicked, but Hee-ja looked on while staying \\*inside\\* the car giving Woo-joo a nasty glare. A child nearly killing herself wasn't enough to make her rethink her actions.\n\nMy last comment is about Min-yeong. I know she is less hateful because she felt lonely in her relationship with Dong-jin. I don't \\*hate\\* her but I also will not forgive her. Instead of just breaking up with Dong-jin gracefully, she did it in a way that emotionally destroyed him. That wasn't necessary and he didn't deserve that. And offering a fraudulent investment offer to CEO Shin just to help Dong-jin? It did not help Dong-jin at all, and triggered CEO Shin to violence. Her behavior is that of a spoiled person without proper boundaries or manners.\n\nSo obviously, I object to Min-yeong + Sun-woo. Please no. He deserves better.\n\nLooking forward to swooning again on Tuesday. I can't wait. Love reading all your thoughts on this gorgeous show. I will be sad when this drama ends.",

The nickname started when Joon was telling Hye Seong that she may not be compatible with her bf and that she has a history of being really passionate in her relationships while her boyfriends are lukewarm at best. This lead to hyeseong angrily stomping off and saying she will be mokseong and not hyeseong in front of his parents when they are pretending to be fake dating. I didn't understand this Jupiter Comet thing at all, do you have more observations about what it means?",

Just a simple touch and those intense stares spoke volumes. They were really talking through their eyes. Excellent pairing these two. \n\nLSK nailed that last scene in Ep10. I really feel for her. Torn between guilt and devotion to family vs her growing affection for DJ. I think there was some relief too, that she was able to be there for DJ.\n\nWe witnessed major character changes in DJ! Everytime he smiles my heart skips a beat \ud83d\ude04 everytime WJ is mean to him, I feel bad. Wanna hug him \ud83d\ude05 we all know that's her lovespeak. Kim Young kwang's acting is so on point! Every.damn.scene.\n\nI like Jun's character. Even if he and Hye Seong don't end up together, its nice that he always have their back. And vice versa. He is family. I also liked Jigu, he showed some maturity (finally) even if he was annoying in earlier episodes lol!  How perceptive of him that WJ always carry burden of the family. i can relate so much to this sibling dynamics.\n\nI always have rollercoaster of emotions watching this kdrama. So amazing. Everything in this kdrama complement each other - from the story, the direction, cinematography, the acting, the OST!\n\nThe only thing not clear to me is the Sim mom's reaction to losing the house. Even if she didn't know the circumstances, why would it be her children's fault? Or was she just lashing out? That she didn't realise the house still belonged to ex-hubby? Unless she has the house deed or some kind of paperwork, perhaps she also feels guilty that they technically lost the house. Am sure this will be answered in next Eps! And i still think something fishy w the dad's will it was somehow mentioned in previous ep. So likely they will get the house back or some inheritance from the dad.\n\nStory-wise its still going strong. Hope its continues and we get a satisfactory ending. What to do - 6 MORE days to go til next Wed \ud83d\ude33",

Shim Woojoo not-so-subtly inviting herself to Dongjin\u2019s house and not vehemently denying it when he pointed it out. \n2. Shim Woojoo immediately agreeing to go camping with Dongjin and turned down the offer to come back without spending the night. \n\nHelloo? Does she understand the implications?? I do love that she herself is living by her own advice of doing what she wants. I wonder Dongjin will say it back to her if she tries to leave him due to her family issues. It will surely not be what she wants. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that we see &gt;!his confession in the episode 11 preview!&lt; but I was going crazy at the lack of verbal affirmation that they both liked each other. But then this drama is all about non-verbal communication. I love how flustered Woojoo looked when he visited her at the hospital. Lee Sung Kyung plays that character so well. I might go and rewatch Bokjoo. \n\nThat road they took to the campsite was stunning. Loved how sheepish Dongjin looked when the campsite ajusshi noticed Woojoo with him. Woojoo was her most pleasant self yet in this drama in front of Dongjin, while she spoke to the ajusshi. Something I really want to see is Woojoo fully smiling and for Dongjin to be totally blown away and tell her she\u2019s pretty (because Lee Sung Kyung is so pretty when she smiles!!)",

            "comment": "I will probably have to rewatch from the beginning, there is so much going on that I missed at first glance.\n\nTake for example the scene in EP2 where Dongjin enters the office wearing a suit jacket and carrying the tattered backpack and observes Ms Baek interviewing  Woojoo. \nRepeated in EP9 as Ms Baek offers Woojoo a full time position, but Woojoo is upset at Dongjin (and is trying to end everything about her misbegotten revenge plot) where Dongjin is no longer carrying the tattered backpack, and isn't wearing a suit jacket.  \n\nPresumably symbolizing he has both let go of emotional baggage, and is lightening up, thanks to Woojoo's influence in his life.\n\nTo go further, in both scenes Woojoo is wearing a shirt with stripes. Symbolically,  striped shirts represented outcasts - think prison outfits of the past - and those deemed mad.\n\nJust as Woojoo herself is somewhat of a pariah at work (eg not going to company dinner), and was emotional/irrational going to the funeral and hatching the revenge idea.\n\nThe latter shirt the same one that gets blood stains on it when she (foolishly? or only apparently foolish?) allows herself to get hit by Sungman with the rock.\n\nWill have to write later about Jun and HS eating after the unfinished dinner with his parents - the framing of the two foreshadowing them close but separate, then together, as we begin to see in EP10.",

                            "comment": "Thanks.\n\nI'll just keep posting them kind of randomly, there are so many.\n\nThe opening of EP1 has a radio host say \"that if you want to understand, if you want to forgive, and if you wanna love someone . . . you should observe how they look from the back for a long while. Then if you do just that, you don't have to unnecessarily try to understand, forgive, or love them, because their lonely shadow will have made you cry without you even knowing . . . To understand someone's loneliness well . . . that's the beginning of love.\"\n\nThe obvious connection is in EP4 where the original subtitles have Woojoo say she dislikes  Dongjin's back.\n\nBut watching carefully in EP2 the choreography of how Dongjin exits Sunwoo's fancy truck - I presume it was done deliberately so that his back is (only partially,  also  deliberately) to Woojoo who has gone to confront him about the house - her first time seeing him.\n\nJust as the first time he sees her, it is her back only that he sees, as he exits the 5th floor elevator and sees Ms. Baek interviewing her in the boardroom.\n\nThen watch in EP10 when Woojoo suggests they get coffee after lunch together and go for \na walk - one of her first (but not the first) moves to get friendly to him -  first she is watching his back as he orders coffee at the counter (one hot, one iced, of course, just as he is mostly calm and collected while she is impulsive and wears her heart on her sleeve) and then he turns to look at her, again seeing her back.\n\nAnd it's almost certainly not a coincidence that the office is on the 5th floor - the number 5 appears to have significant meaning. Woojoo gets 5 stitches over her eye, bringing the torn and broken skin together to heal it and reduce scarring.\n\nPerhaps foreshadowing the 5 others coming together and healing - the three siblings,  Jun, and Dongjin.\n\nAt least, that's how I see it.",

I was going to steer clear of the show because I didn\u2019t want to deal with angst or sadness but curiosity got the better of me and I started to sift through comments and everyone\u2019s observations just drew me in. I love LSY and although I\u2019ve only ever seen one show of KYK I have to admit it took me a while to realize I had. I assumed I hadn\u2019t seen any show of his and was just blown away by his compelling presence. \n\nLong stream of consciousness dump of thoughts incoming below\u2026\n\nThis show is actually everything I love about KDramas. It\u2019s \u201cslow\u201d but always moving\u2026almost like a stream. But unlike a stream packs such depth. It\u2019s such a great portrayal of how we all carry our burdens so differently. Whether it\u2019s showing how the three siblings handled their difficult childhood differently or how the emotional scars are similar yet different and manifest themselves so differently. On the flip Dongjin and Woojoo both are most affected by the same person (well in Woojoo\u2019s case DJ\u2019s mother is one of the 3 adults to have messed her up most) and so there is a more common manner in which their grief has shaped them. They\u2019re both good hearted and principled, quiet and always in self-preservation mode yet they\u2019re the most resilient. \n\nThe constant flashbacks can sometimes feel like an overused storytelling device but like Dongjin that one statement by Woojoo affected me so deeply that I don\u2019t mind it\u2026it\u2019s the one where she comments on his physical demeanour but instead of chastising it as a character flaw, she points out how he\u2019s not one to be worn down or struck down (which when you compare to what she said to her sister as something she disliked about him is so telling). The way KYK has expressed how deeply that affected him is just spectacular to watch because it\u2019s expressed more through expressions and physicality than words. \n\nWoojoo\u2019s self awareness is her greatest strength. People often mistake folks who tend to either be difficult or who self-sabotage to do so out of lack of self-awareness, but she does or behaves the way she does in-spite of it. As as example, telling him that she knows she\u2019s giving him mixed signals because she\u2019s working out stuff for herself. It\u2019s honest and direct, and has clearly gone a long way in him accepting it (even if she didn\u2019t explain it very well in the first instance). \n\nI love that in Episode 10 he seemed to grow confidence in \u201cpushing\u201d her just a little bit more in opening up/loosen up. Using her advice to embolden himself and test the waters. Getting out of a funk is so difficult, and romantic interest or not, I too would be so grateful to whoever managed to help me achieve it\u2026the juxtaposition at the end of the episode with how she\u2019s sat &gt;!alone finally breaking down!&lt; however, was so incredibly heartbreaking. I hope that having spent the first 10 episodes helping him overcome some of his hurdles, the \u201cfocus\u201d will now shift to getting Woojoo to a more comfortable place. My sincere hope when things unfold is that he\u2019s shown to have had some inkling or idea of the \u201cdeception\u201d and doesn\u2019t take it hard and instead focusses his energy on getting her and them to a better place. That will truly win me over. \n\nLSY is just haunting. Her \u201cblank\u201d stares or looks carry so much emotion. She uses her physicality so well in expressing her character that you cannot help but root for her even though you\u2019re constantly wanting to shake her and tell her it\u2019s time that in some regard she move on with her life, deeply think about what it is she actually wants from her life and for once do what she thinks is best for her without worrying about the others. I hope by the conclusion of this story this is where she lands up. \n\nHaesung is a precious bean and I hope to god she learns to love herself and be confident in herself and know her worth - and then recognize that she and Jun would actually make a great couple. Jun tends to harbour a stronger saviour complex towards Woojoo which I hope to god he doesn\u2019t mistake for feelings. When he was speaking to his mother and said &gt;!they\u2019re both like air and he needs them to survive!&lt; I was so bowled over because it\u2019s true, the four of them are a unit and are family, and it\u2019s that foundation that he really has with Woojoo. Whereas with Haesung it\u2019s the foundation yet almost as if he\u2019s closed out the possibility of anything more because he thinks she\u2019d never be interested in him that way or that she wants something completely different which he\u2019s not really thought about in depth. In reality I feel like his observations about her are deeper and that of romantic interest in nature. \n\nJun himself is very hard to read but I really enjoyed the insight provided about how he grew up as &gt;!the odd ball in his family and has spent his life seeking love and companionship and unbridled support!&lt;. I hope to god they don\u2019t bring in any love triangle/rectangle situation. He and the girls\u2019 characters deserve better. \n\nThe brother whilst written as a very typical youngest sibling in KDramas actually has flashes of sensibility. The fact that he stormed off &gt;!at the karaoke bar and came back immediately after to say at least tell me why so I can either understand or persuade you!&lt; shows that he isn\u2019t quite the ungrateful kid he\u2019d been somewhat portrayed to be thus far. \n\nFor that matter even though Suho, his friend, was &gt;!ultimately shown to be an immature jerk!&lt; I appreciated that he too hadn\u2019t been written in one colour. He showed incredible understanding, which even made it possible for Haesung to &gt;!admit her issues to him!&lt;. It\u2019s sad he was a jerk but I\u2019d put that down to perhaps youth.  \n\nThe best friend whilst sometimes annoying and in the first instance unidimensional is yet another self-aware character and one that is tuned into those around him. I think Minyoung needs serious help and I feel like he deserves better so I hope that what they\u2019re implying doesn\u2019t transpire eventually. \n\nMin young is an interesting person yet at the same time I\u2019m very over her. It\u2019s clear that their relationship had run its course and they both made mistakes but she\u2019s clearly someone who thought a \u201cnuclear\u201d option was the best way to handle it, which was particularly cruel. I understand how difficult it is to be with a partner that\u2019s closed off and uncommunicative because he thinks that\u2019s a way of protecting you, but what she seemingly did was very cruel because you can tell she knew what the consequences of her actions would be on him. That aside she has a FANTASTIC wardrobe and I want everything in it!!\n\nAnd finally, enough cannot be said about how scenes of this show are blocked and framed. It is so clear how it elevates the storytelling and performances a whole other notch!\n\nSigh I almost regret catching up with all the episodes because the show is perfect for a binge but I also didn\u2019t want to miss out on the rich on-air discussions. \n\nThis may well be one of my favourite shows of this year. I\u2019ve fallen, and fallen hard!\n\nEdits: typos, clarity of thought, grammar.",

It ties into her flashbacks, as well as directly to the opening monologue in EP1 and many other of her original subtitles.\n\nThen she leaves not by saying it doesn't matter that he heard she was just making an observation, but rather that it is no big deal saying that he looks pathetic, which is far harsher and more in keeping with her feelings after the encounter with his mother in EP3, and makes it so much more meaningful when she overhears Dongjin tell Sunwoo that his life is pathetic, just before she pulls him from being hit by the car.\n\nSame as Minyoung's words to Dongjin at end of EP5, the original subtitles were much better and tied to various other things said.\n\nI hope they go back to the original subtitles.",

            "comment": "Okay\u2026 thoughts! There will be spoilers  since I\u2019ve seen both eps already. \n\nI\u2019ll just write about both eps at once because they\u2019re so connected.\n\nWJ being hurt by seeing DJ be hugged by his ex - and him actually confronting her about what it was that made her so distant pretty much right away - was so unexpected from a kdrama but highly needed and appreciated. \n\nAlso him telling her she\u2019s the one making his life the hardest right now by acting hot and cold all the time and then her basically fishing for a confession by saying that a \u2018mere part timer shouldn\u2019t bother him so much\u2019. I feel like that was a great link to the bench scene from the previous week with her telling him she couldn\u2019t have recognised her feelings because every time they surface he pretends to not see it. \n\nHim being so bothered by WJs accident (who btw went to his house to apologise for making his life hard and to restate she REALLY meant it that she wishes for him to have it more carefree) that he didn\u2019t even look at MJ. When he reached for WJs face and she grabbed his hand I was so worried she would push him away\u2026 and yet she didn\u2019t even question why he was there. \n\nMJ is struggling hard and surprisingly makes us like her and root for her\u2026 but just with the SML, not DJ ever lol \n\nI really like it how WJ reads DJ in the business situation where she reassured him that he wasn\u2019t being petty and told him to do whatever he wants with the contract. I feel like he has such low self esteem that he needs even the gentlest sign that what he wants is actually ok and WJ grants that perfectly. \n\nI was worried we would find out she was still plotting with the enemy\u2019s team but now I am pretty certain that\u2019s behind her as she genuinely has his best interest in mind. \n\nI like that they went camping together and stayed the night there yet we didn\u2019t see anything. For now, the relationship is not labelled as anything, I am assuming nothing happened during the trip. They just spent time together and - judging how she passed out in the car ride back home - both couldn\u2019t sleep through the night. \n\nI loved how he had already planned another trip for them, and to his favourite camping site at that! He sees her in his future which I think is huge for relationships. I also was shocked that when he asked if she\u2019d like to go on this other trip her initial reaction was to give a vague response, almost like she wanted to subtly reject him, but then started explaining herself and basically going back on her initial words to make him feel better. She would have never backed down in the beginning of the series but this situation made me realise she actually started doing that quite a lot now! Character progression.\n\nI was shocked to see the mom there - I assumed she was bedridden or super sick to the point of being on the brink of death. She seems to be doing just fine physically so that surprised me a lot. I hope she doesn\u2019t stay for long but judging from how she looked (well dressed, youthful and well groomed) she may be the catalyst for the house issue - I really think the mistress faked the will and the mom will somehow sort this out. \n\nI also think that her reaction wasn\u2019t because she was so sad about the house - more so that her kids didn\u2019t tell her they were going through something like that. It must have been traumatic and as their mom, I think she was just disappointed in herself that she didn\u2019t know sooner. Having said that, I absolutely don\u2019t think that if we ever get to see the relationship between WJ and DJ develop the families would be on board. \n\nI am hoping WJ comes clean about the house situation and her involvement in the initial company issues (where honestly she didn\u2019t even do much) and they can work it all out. \n\nCan\u2019t wait for the next ones \ud83d\udc94",

Then she opens the second set of blinds, revealing Dongjin facing us (I presume Yuri was placed with her back to us deliberately). And finally she opens the third set of blinds, revealing Sunwoo facing us.\n\nNo need to put a scene of opening blinds - the story is rich and deep already - but to me it shows how much devotion to detail has gone into this show.\n\nAt least, that's how I see it.",

I watched that scene twice or thrice - it was such a satisfying feeling to see the blinds come up one by one. \n\nThis drama is not the first one I have felt that proper direction/camerawork can create things that are seemingly ordinary into something beautiful or aesthetic. But that\u2019s art, isn\u2019t it? To beautify the ordinary elements. But your input adds an extra layer of symbolism. Thank you so much for writing these, I really appreciate it.",

I\u2019m always floored anytime people pick up these subtleties and can only imagine how excited the creators might feel if they knew the audience picked up on all these tiny nuances that to a not so keen eye would just slide on by. As you said, the story and characterization is so rich already that such attention to detail is not \u201cnecessary\u201d but just goes to show how immersed the writers and directors are in telling us this story.",

But FINALLY, some softness between these two. I like that DJ actually confronted WJ about her hot and cold behavior, and she actually went out of her way to find him to apologize and explain (after contemplation). I really really love the character development!\n\nReally enjoy the cast of characters here. Everyone feels so very realistic and relatable.

            "comment": "I am enjoying watching Sunwoo interact with Minyoung, and there are a couple of things that I will need to re-watch for:\n\n\\- EP10, Sun-woo says only boyfriend or family can ask her to stop drinking, which is exactly what Dongjin did in EP8 - earlier he says he finally doesn't care what she does, but then he tells her to stop drinking. So although Dongjin made things clear at the hospital that she should literally leave the hospital/figuratively leave behind their past relationship, she is still getting mixed messages from him. Out of all my exes, there are a few that will always be a part of my life, so I will be interested to see where/if they go with this. \n\n\\- EP7 or 8 where Sun-woo is describing selling the car - I am convinced the entire conversation is a double entendre for what Minyoung has gone through, hence her harsh reaction, but I haven't been able to piece it together.\n\nFinally, in EP10 I thought Dongjin was unfair to leave unchallenged Minyoung's assertion that it was her fault that Woojoo was hurt. Minyoung's behaviour has not been above reproach, but it was Sungman's fault, not hers. It's interesting that when Dongjin asked for help from Woojoo to spy for him in EP3, she initially refused and was even still considering revenge at that time, while Minyoung used subterfuge to help Dongjin without being asked.

            "comment": "The more I think about it, the more think it is quite possible Minyoung faked cheating on Dongjin.\n\nWe have already seen that we are sometimes led to believe something that turns out to be different \u2013 the big example being that the house was never sold.\n\nDongjin certainly believes she cheated on him, but she may have allowed him to mistakenly believe that. Here is why I think that:\n\nThe show \u2013 which is clearly very carefully done and pays attention to details \u2013 is very careful to never explicitly show her cheating, nor have her explicitly admit it. The show goes to great lengths to imply (ie. to get the viewer to infer) that she actually cheated.\n\nThe only thing explicit is Dongjin saying that she cheated. And as we know, Dongjin can be mistaken about things \u2013 one example is initially believing Woojoo was the spy, when in fact it was Cha.\n\nWe see Dongjin witness Minyoung on a phone call with someone else, and we witness Minyoung tell Dongjin one time she can\u2019t go camping the next week because she has to meet someone. In the context of Dongjin thinking of the past relationship, it is clear the show is leading us to infer that she is cheating.\n\nBut there is another possibility, that the show has also hinted at. We also see Minyoung receive a text late at night in bed, with Dongjin turned away from her.  It is quite possible Dongjin thinks she is texting another lover, however we know that she is texting Dongjin\u2019s mother. We also know that Dongjin appears to have issues with Minyoung having a relationship with his mother, and interestingly in the present when Minyoung meets her again and is asked for a loan, her initial reaction is that it must be kept secret from Dongjin.\n\nSo here is what I think may have happened. Minyoung was in a five year relationship with someone uncommunicative, and who to her eyes at least may have a negative view of marriage (given his mother\u2019s repeated marriages that scarred him so deeply). He even appeared to express disapproval that she approached his mother. At this point, Minyoung decided to cast the dice and put pressure on Dongjin \u2013 either dive further into the relationship, or break it off.\n\nWhile the healthy thing to do would probably be for Minyoung to confront Dongjin directly and openly about it, we see that is not her personality. When she has gained the information about Shin, she does not openly tell him to stop pursuing her for an investment, rather we see her avoid his calls. She \u2013 like many people \u2013 avoids confrontation, and relies on her avoidance to hopefully send the message. So it would be no surprise that rather than outright break up with Dongjin, she hoped that by allowing him to believe she was cheating, he would get the hint and end things with her.\n\nBut instead, Dongjin let it slide for a year. Just as Minyoung let it drag out for a year. They both have a role to play in this heartbreak. Listen to Dongjin\u2019s angry words to Shin about letting things slide. Those words don\u2019t just apply to him putting up with Shin\u2019s revenge and Woojoo getting hurt, they apply to him continuing a broken relationship with Minyoung and the two of them getting hurt. I don\u2019t think the double entendre is a coincidence by the show writers. Interestingly, after disengaging from Shin (thanks to Sunwoo, who is always totally awesome), the first person he sees is . . . Minyoung, sitting beside Woojoo's bed, blood on her sleeve from having tried to stop the bleeding.\n\nBack to the ending of their five year relationship, I think when Minyoung realized that Dongjin would continue to let things slide, would not take action to establish some kind of positive relationship with his mother, Minyoung resorted to the marriage stratagem to end things. Even then, we see Dongjin would let things slide if she didn\u2019t do it in the most brutal way possible, while camping.\n\nSo why the wedding invitation the next day? Because this show is about revenge, and how harmful it is to the one pursuing it. We see it with Shin, we see it with Woojoo, we even see Dongjin tried to get revenge on Minyoung by attempting to live a happy life to spite her (rather than simply live a happy life for himself) but dwelling on that past just left him \u201cbored and lonely\u201d. I think the wedding invitation may have been sent by Minyoung in an ill-advised moment of spite over his apparent lack of reaction when she told him she was leaving him. And yeah, it has backfired on her, as we see from her alcoholism and inability to move on.\n\nSo yeah, she was a scumbag for not being more up front, she was a scumbag for breaking up with him so harshly, but I am not so certain she was a scumbag for cheating on him, if it was just a ruse.\n\nAs I said, I really identify with Minyoung\u2019s character, and I will be interested to see whether my doubts about her cheating are answered in the remaining episodes. Do I think two such people should reunite as a couple? No, some things can\u2019t be undone. But can they reunite as friends, flawed individuals who still care for each other and have shared memories of happiness together? Yeah, I think they could do that, once they have dealt with their issues.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just how I see it for now.",

And if they'd kissed, we would have seen in. I really don't expect the drama to hit us with a first kiss scene in a flashback.\n\nWe weren't shown the sleeping arrangements simply because WJ and DJ are both adults and the drama is treating them as such instead of using physical proximity as a plot device. I could share a tent with a guy for one night without combusting and so could most 30-year-old women, I think.\n\nThis is all my personal opinion, of course. If there was more to that night, I'm sure we'll find out next week.",

            "comment": "**Episode 9:**\n\n* DJ is sooo attractive now that he is so much more energetic\n* What made me really sad is how WJ said, her siblings won't ask about the stitches. That they don't have deep conversations anymore. And she was right, her sister did let it pass. Even though they are going through similar troubles, they don't really rely on each other for support. \n* Instead, someone who got very angry is Jun! That shows just how close he is to the whole family. I would be really interested in more information how it came to be that he and WJ became so close.\n\n**Episode 10:**\n\n* My opinion on Suho (BF to the older sister HS) is a bit softer. I liked most of his reactions so far, telling her she shouldn't force herself to be liked and instead focus on what she wants to do. It tells me, he wants a real connection and not a girlfriend who only does what he likes. I also liked his reaction to her telling him she can't handle big crowds. He stays and is calm and comforting. I also don't think what he told his friend is that bad. Wasn't he simply trying to make his friend understand, that he can't join a crowded place right now, because his girlfriend told him some big information about taking medicin so he can't leave right now? Is it unfortunate timing? Yes. Is it mean and evil of him? No. \n* Instead, I think Suho has a lot more right to be angry. HS told him: I just used you. There is this pretty older woman pursuing you quite a lot and then she tells you, that it was all just so she won't look lonely and desperate? I'd be so hurt! And then she just leaves, no word, no text, doesn't answer calls? I'd be super upset, that's not how you handle conflict. Actually, there wasn't even any conflict! He has no idea what's happening.\n* I'm not super psyched that the mom is back. I guess it was to be expected, but Korean family relations are so incredibly foreign to me, that I usually find it very difficult to relate. For example, one of my favorite KDramas is \"Something in the Rain\" but the mother there is so difficult, unreasonable and physically loud and embarrassing with the shouting and screaming. I do understand that Korean culture is different, but for me it's difficult to watch because I cannot relate to it at all.",

Decided to watch the first episode and in the first 5 minutes, the brother is reading an exam prep book with the year 2022. ML walks past a poster for a 2021 exhibition. Woojoo\u2019s dad\u2019s funeral takes place in 2022 (The date is on the text she received). \n\nI don\u2019t know the significance of 2019 yet but it could be when the ML\u2019s ex broke up with him. Maybe he\u2019s still stuck in that time. Idk the answer but I\u2019m pretty sure the story is set in 2022",

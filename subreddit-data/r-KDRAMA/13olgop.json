The lee sisters are so cute together and young heesub is surprisingly heart-fluttering.\n\nI have a feeling that the uncle is a protester, which is why he meets up with the teacher. Heesub mustve done something for the hyung to get caught+tortured which is why he\u2019s so devoted to him as they grow old. Probs out of guilt.\n\nI still think its ko mi sook. If its not her, im betting on the bong bong waitress.\n\nAnyway, correct me if im wrong but didnt ml say in a previous episode that the victims bodies were never found? Im a bit lost in this part",

I thought we were working towards the most idealistic resolution but they fully flipped it towards the cruelest path. Her aunt's death looked especially brutal and the grandmother showed the regret of losing someone too soon so powerfully. I'm hoping the \"my perfect stranger\" title has nothing to do with one of them disappearing in the end. Ko Mi-sook genuinely feels like an insane manipulator.!&lt;",

I haven't watched a series that has kept me on edge and leaving me waiting like crazy for awhile now.

At the same time, other statistics, like number of hours worked by mothers of girls vs boys, resource investment in education for girls vs boys,  hours of household chores assigned to girls vs boys, and the influence of the first born's sex on subsequent births have also been evening out, particularly in the last two decades.\n\nKim Ji-young, Born 1982 also deals with it and has been pretty influential/popular in the last 5 years or so.",

I want to watch it as is but can\u2019t because there are missing scenes not shown in these episodes, so there will be a lot of flashbacks to the scenes from different angle. These things made me dread watching this type of drama because us the viewers were never provided the full event therefore cannot see what\u2019s truly happening. The timeline will be messed up then it got worse with the time travel. \n\nMy theory so far is Go Min Sook as the planner - who picks the victim and persuades the murderer to do the deed and watches from afar. Murderer - owner of Bong2 Teahouse or the bully girl. The message inside the matchbox is meant for FL\u2019s mom as Min Sook is jealous of her and her family and wants to destroy her family. \n\nAs I write this post, I realize I have too many questions:\n- Since none of the murders were prevented, the ML would die at the end or was the FL there to save him/understand why her family is such a mess?\n- why was the ML killed when he was not around the first murder occurred?",

It keeps me engaged, I have no clue who is the murderer? \nMy theory is that it has to be more than 1 person, specially &gt;!after episode 8, 2 people died the same night. The uncle broke his arm, so no way he could\u2019ve done it. The guy who found the teacher was too scared to have done it.!&lt; I know Ko Mi Soo must be involved somehow. \nExcited to find more clues to help us find out who is the culprit.",

Every sibling pair in this show and others I'm watching have this pattern!) - the creepy brother of the 'author'/bully/scary girl, not Yoon Yong's uncle. He was still at large.)\n\nI agree that it's probably two people - my money is on the two bullies (Min Soo? and the girl with the dark eyes/dark eye circles).",

Hee Seop obviously isn't guilty, and I'm not really sure his brother is, either... although he is suspicious for whatever reason. Also, Hee Seop (Yoon Yong's father) and the student teacher are both involved in the same organisation, which is why he's anxious about what happens with her... although that might be more due to his brother, because his brother is the one who was going to meet with her. So either he or his brother are part of whatever group it is. !&lt;",

Mine is \u201cPerhaps Love\u201d from Goong. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/73lwJ5P3ehRiqimOgWiwOE?si=rJT6ABMvT2ujqtYo4QyyMQ&amp;context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A7f5y7dlfJi13pkTJ74zcA1\n\nI first watched Goong in 2007. 16 years later and I still love it. It was always at the top of my favorite OST songs until Hospital Playlist OST came along.",

This song is my favorite  from BOF, and I haven't even watched BOF since back in 2009 or 2010 (don't think it aged well and the acting sucks). \n\nStill loved OST from Autumn in My Heart, Winter Sonata, and Full House too, even though I don't listen to them very often but they are very nostalgic for me since these were my very first K-dramas (oh boy, did I just reveal what an old lady I am? \ud83e\udd23 )",

I will be surprised if the final rounds won\u2019t see a matchup between HP/Mido and Falasol songs.  Being the same age as the 99s, I immediately connected to these songs even if I\u2019ve never heard of them before (except for It\u2019s My Life which of course I knew since I was a fan of Bon Jovi back in high school).\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised we have the Drama version of &gt;!Butterfly!&lt; in the brackets which any HP fan knew is a wink from Shin PD.\n\nETA2: I didn\u2019t have the time to nominate a few other songs, mainly for Park Eunbin dramas, which make me sad:\n\n-\tfrom **Do You Like Brahms?**: opening theme, traumerai, Close To Me (Punch) and Kiss Me (Taeyeon)\n-\tfrom **The King\u2019s Affection**: I Believe (An da eun), If I (Baek ji young), King\u2019s Love Waltz\n-\tfrom **EAW**: Better than Birthday \ud83d\ude2d",

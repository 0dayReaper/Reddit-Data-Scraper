The Greatest Love is a hit with him as second male lead in it, but it was mostly because of Gong Hyo Jin (known for hits after hits). And I've taken a look at his dramas and none of them are on the level of hallyu wave dramas that the other stars you named have. The only possibility is that his boyband was popular? I don't follow kpop so I'm not sure.",

She is now a housewife and married to Jae Ho (Kim Sung Oh), who works as a doctor. They live in a house with a yard. Joo Ran is happy and lives an ideal life. Her peaceful daily life is abruptly shook when she notices a strange smell in her backyard. This leads to Joo Ran eventually investigating her husband and meeting Sang Eun. \n&gt;\n&gt;Sang Eun (Lim Ji Yeon) lives a completely different life from Joo Ran. She grew up in a poor environment and, even now, suffers from financial difficulties. She lives in a shabby rented apartment with her husband Yoon Beom (Choi Jae Rim). Yoon Beom works for a pharmaceutical company. Sang Eun is subject to domestic violence by her husband Yoon Beom. Her life is completely miserable. One day, she receives a phone call that Yoon Beom is dead.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/House_with_a_Yard)",

I first watched her alongside PHS in \"High Society,\" and then she starred in the mature movie \"Obsessed.\" With all those roles, she has been unrecognizable and has done justice to her characters. Oh, and I miss KTH's acting too.",

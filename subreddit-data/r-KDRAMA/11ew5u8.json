Working class people like money so much because we need it to survive. Stop shaming the taxi driver man for trying to make a living \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d &gt;! Not all of us have sketchy high ranking cop murder dads. !&lt;\n\nEP. 2: the widow, &gt;!after a long, whirlwind day of being scammed and also finding out she's pregnant!&lt;, watching a dude high five the air and then yell at it for having &gt;! his mom's hair tie !&lt;: \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udee5\n\nAlso every time ghost girl calls him greedy and obsessed with money, I get so annoyed. I get that you're dead, but being homeless while trying to take care of your aged grandma isn't fun either, ma'am.\n\nAnyways, ep. 2 was less fun imo - very run of the mill storyline - but it was still engaging ig. I like the banter and dynamics between the leads. Based on the opening sequence (which was kinda cute &amp; reminds me of Good Job, another kdrama I liked), I guess that ghost girl and taxi boy will start investigating the murders. I think that will be a way more enjoyable storyline but let's see what happens.\n\nAlso since the FL is 30 and ML is 22, does this count as a noona romance?",

I know her character will get better but it was really annoying to watch her when she\u2019s babbling about her rights and bickering with the other ghost, keep raising her voice demanding his attention while he\u2019 was driving that lead up to the small collision.

            "comment": "Writer Kang Sol pinned one of my favorite makjangs ever (Show Window) so I'm here to support their next work no matter what. I like the director for the most part but they can be a little uneven with some types of scenes being absolute perfection while others are a bit eye-roll inducing.\n\nMy initial impressions are (1) I love the animated opening sequence, so fun and cute! (2) Min Ah is gorgeous, especially when she's smiling!\n\nYoon Chan Young has grown up nicely from his SFD days.\n\nAnyways, overall liked the set up and enjoyed the humor and emotional beats.\n\nI want more makjang from the writer but I'll take whatever they serve up!",

Her business idea was a nice start to accommodate Young Min needs while getting what she wants unless she\u2019s attracting more dishonest ghosts than good ones. \n\nI guess we got two helpful taxi drivers weekly now and I\u2019m not complaining. \ud83d\ude0b",

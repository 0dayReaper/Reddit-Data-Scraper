I was worried how he would be in a saeguk yet he exceeds my expectation and so does the drama as a whole. Definitely adding him to my list of favs. My slight problem is I love the characters and actors individually, but I am not sure Kim Young Dae and Park Jung Hyun have that *sparkly* chemistry that would elevate this drama. Her and the SML have better chemistry but I also love her character, I just don\u2019t feel the sparks with her and Kim Young Dae. He had better chemistry with Lee Sung Kyung in SS\u2026 but the love story in here is so much fun. \n\n**Taxi Driver 2** is still going great but gotta say I don\u2019t care for Big Bad.

I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what it is because obviously they don\u2019t necessarily look alike, but I think it\u2019s their eyes and they both make very similar facial expressions (incredulous shock and slight disgust lol). But now I am dying for them to be brothers in a drama together because I feel like it would be so believable!",

How the mother felt multitude of emotions at each stage of dealing with a special child, her confusion if she was acting for herself or for her son, her guilt, love and tenacity was very realistically portrayed.\r\n\r\nCho seung woo was phenomenal as always. His natural acting lightened the heaviness of a typical feature film and made it very enjoyable. The ending was the best for me, his urgency to participate in the marathon which he couldn't convey in words hit me in the heart. If I could, I almost would jump through the screen to free his hands and tell him to run with all his heart after a tight, warm hug :')\r\n\r\nHeart warming story, beautiful acting. Highly recommend esp if you love csw's acting. **(9/10)**",

The danger in playing this kind of role is over-acting, or too much artificial movement. But Cho showed quite natural acting. \r\n\r\n&gt;The reason: Cho met with Bae Hyung-jin, a real-life person whose story inspired the movie, observed Hyun-jin at home, at school, and ran with him, to portray his character as real as possible. \"There are excellent foreign films concerning an autistic person, but I did not think about such works. Instead, I tried to be true to my own emotions and feelings, and Hyung-jin helped me a lot,\" Cho said. Cho said he had felt deeply lonely throughout the acting because he had to avoid eye contact as much as possible. (mdl comments) \r\n\r\nWith every work of Cho seung woo, I am more and more falling in love with him &lt;3",

People kept fighting and dying and then not dying and then fighting and then crying and the music would swell dramatically and the characters would stare at each other and I still have no idea what's happening. Lee Da-Hee as the FL looked so amazing I will dream of the day she does a drama with Lee Soo-Hyuk because the hotness would combust the screen. Cha Eun-woo in his combat priest outfit was also worth the price of admission. Glad I watched it but still confused. \n\nFinished **The Glory Part 2** and thought they nailed what they were going for. I'm a sucker for a noona romance so I liked that part, too. \n\nCaught up with **Taxi Driver 2** and while the first episode took too long to catch us up, it was worth the wait. Lee Je-Hoon is putting on a master class in character switching, and the show seems dedicated to making him look as cool as possible and it is working for me! \n\nWatching **Stranger (Secret Forest)** and loving it. Cho Seung-Woo is wonderfully restrained, making every subtle change of expression feel like a secret you're sharing with the character. Bae Doo-Na is amazing as always and I'm really loving her character. \n\nSo many shows so little time!",

Or maybe not because it is offensive, usually it isn't, but because the viewer can identify the prayer with preferred faith. \n\nOr maybe even because which faith is often not important to the story? \n\nMany religious people in Asia are not very restrictive about what they believe in. I knew someone who said he was both Buddhist and Christian, for example. \"But that doesn't work, What about the afterlife?\" and the day after he had thought about it and decided he went for reincarnation. I also know some Muslims who believe in reincarnation. So it could also be a different approach to religion?",

Research shows things like a change in the brain similar to meditation, for example. Unfortunately, I don't believe, and that is it. \n\nDid I tell you about my proud moment in Nepal when everybody else thought there were ghosts? \n\nSleeping on top floor, some noise from the roof, clump clump and mumbling in a weird manner. I went down to the reception, the guard didn't believe me but finally went up with me. Then when we came almost up, he became so scared we went down again to wake the other guard. On the way up again also a male tourist joined us. Day after some other tourists said they heard us, but were too scared to go out of their room. Even with three men there, I had to go out on the roof first. And there was just a crazy woman praying.  The guards where looking around: \"Is it only you here?\" LOL\n\nNot believing also has its perks.",

It\u2019s like the writer for episode 16 was the mortal enemy of the writer for episodes 1 - 15 and intentionally tried to steer the characters and plot into a ditch filled with toxic waste and then set it on fire. It\u2019s really that bad. Especially when I had enjoyed the show so very much up to that point. I\u2019d prefer to rewatch all of Boys Over Flowers rather than rewatch episode 16.\n\nGo ahead and watch Kiss Sixth Sense, just stop after episode 15. Spoiler for episode 16: &gt;! FL and ML are still together at the very end, but their characters changed so much in the one episode that you may want to fling them into the nearest sun. !&lt;",

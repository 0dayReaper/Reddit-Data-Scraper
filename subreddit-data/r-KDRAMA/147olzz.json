I mean, it did lack the romance factor &gt;!(although we did get to see Lee Rang finally declare his love for Yeo Hee)!&lt; but it more than made up for it with being a type of \"action buddy movie\".  I love the story between brothers and friends learning to get past former grievances, as well as that particular historical period.  \n\nI even managed to get my husband to watch it *which never happens* when I watch k-dramas!  I usually watch KDramas with my dog, and he prefers the Joseon period dramas. No joke, he really watches them!  \n\nETA:  I thought it would be cute to share photos of my dog actually watching k-dramas, but the auto - moderator dinged me because I guess Reddit deems Google photos links inappropriate. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

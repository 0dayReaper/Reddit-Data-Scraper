I think she's improved her subtler acting compared to FFMW in the scenes here where she's acting normal, but they keep making her do really gross and OTT things and make stupid facial expressions which I think is a directorial decision.

They're probably on a budget since they're kind of the 'newest' cable channel to do full-length dramas.  \n\n\nI haven't watched this show yet but the actress is actually why I'm on the fence about watching, I really hated her in Fight for My Way and the other show where she was a lead (Sweden Laundry) I found her acting pretty bad and lacking energy too. I think the only reason she kind of pulled it off in Fight for My Way is the character itself was supposed to be this bland no-energy character so the actress's energy matched that, but I don't think she really has versatility or range and she's horrible at naturalistic acting/micro-expressions.",

They've had some great high-budget seeming ones like Extraordinary Attorney Woo and then some... weirdly janky ones like delivery man, unlock my boss etc. that feel like much 'older' shows to me for some reason. I think maybe they are putting most of their budget on certain shows with more famous actors and then dumping the rest of their budget on shows like this one with less famous casts.  \n\n\nYeah there's something that really bothers me about this actress and I normally don't mind other actresses who get flak for overacting (like Hwang Jung-Eum etc). I can't comment on this drama because I know it's based on a cartoon character but even in shows where she wasn't supposed to be like this on purpose like FFMW I felt she just played the character without much nuance or realism.",

I think this is a pretty common strategy with cable channels that are first trying to break into the market, they need to consistently put out a drama or two to get their name out there but they can't spare the budget for all of them to be quality.  \n\n\nETA: it was a while back but you wouldn't believe how janky some of the early TVN and JTBC dramas were while they were simultanously dropping some of the most iconic shows ever lol",

The scenes cut around weirdly, or else drags on too long for no reason. The story doesn't flow. They were supposedly filming a pilot for an ep, but then suddenly it's already edited and airing, and suddenly her family is watching it on tv?\n\nThey give us some childhood story, but not much on how the adults are thinking now, so their actions make zero sense. The actress for the FL is not bad, but the character does suck (messy, emotional, childish). She's supposed to be a professional PD, looking for a successful variety show to bring her career back to life, but she throws herself into it, and messes it up in a bad way and sulks. The ML shows up suddenly with no character buildup and falls flat.\n\nI hope they do better from now on; I'll give it 2 more eps to try but it isn't looking good.",

The editing is bad but the writing is worse - the entire fake dating show set of scenes in the beginning is completely insane. The episode starts and the main lead introduces himself and then.... stands there silently staring into space for 5 minutes while the other two girls whisper about him amongst themselves while standing 2 feet away from him? What was that?  \n\n\nThen they look to be in some school gymnasium and the 'dating show' opening looks like a highschool debate tournament moderated by an AI blob on a screen... lol what show would have this, couldn't this show afford to hire someone to play the MC?  \n\n\nThen the main PD of the show is a contestant on the show, making it impossible for her to direct/produce? And she has no idea how to make a variety show remotely interesting and can't even make conversation with another contestant for 5 minutes? We're supposed to believe she will ever be a halfway competent producer? I don't feel sorry for her at all that she almost got fired, she completely sucks at her job and has the social skills of a baby.  \n\n\nThen the 'dates' themselves for the show include a tour of the guy's company where he says 'I was interested in neuroscience because I had nightmares... so obviously I studied AI'? That's not how any of that works, why would someone interested in neuroscience 'obviously' get a computer science/software engineering degree and why would they use that to start a fashion company, of all things? What does that have to do with nightmares or sleep problems? This dialogue is the worst most stilted dialogue I've ever seen in a TV show probably.  \n\n\nAlso why are these two grown up adults in their 30s 5everalone and still sulking over something that happened when they were childhood friends? I assume we get more background later but the first flashback FL has is literally just to finding out he moved to the US, and I'm supposed to believe she's still so upset over this 15 years later that she leaves the dinner table without eating and storms out when his name is mentioned? Because why?  \n\n\nI actually have never seen such incredibly nonsensical writing in a show before, but I almost want to keep watching just to see how much worse it can get.",

The character reminds me a little of the FL from Memorials/Into the Ring and Nana did a waaayyy better job portraying a quirky stubborn sometimes clumsy FL.\n\nI tried to stick with it because I love Lee Minjae (from CCIR) but everyone else feels like a real person except the FL and by the middle of ep 2 I gave up. Like the scene where the ML shows up and she is just staring at him and loudly muttering to herself/her frenemy speculating about his identity...the way they shot that scene made no sense. And the dates were also all super cringe. \n\nEspecially bc love is for suckers came out just a few months ago (which had its own issues), i thought this show had to be at least as good as that to stand a chance, but it's so much worse.

The dating show part of this feels completely phoned in, the way they act on the dates and the things they choose to talk about are unreal and all the 'characters' for the dating show seem like the most dull, boring people ever.   \n\n\nLiFS had some issues with the main lead storyline but the part where they got more into the show was actually really good imo, this is just unbelievable to me. The way it's directed and edited also just seems like a mistake, something someone would do in their high school film class like the male lead being introduced and then just standing there for several minutes staring into the void while the PD and another contestant gossip about him right in front of his face and he doesn't react.",

LiFS the reality show parts were interesting and fun to watch but, with the exception of John and Ji-wan, not well written. The bipolar and ED stories were even outright offensive. It also didn't feel like a real show, and if it were it would have been boring. Also, yes, there were interesting or good parts aside from the main story, but the main story took up a TON of screentime. \n\nI liked how this show didn't drag things out like LifS did. LiFS would have been much better without the ex coming back and her almost wedding imo.",

Having low production values is one thing but there are several scenes in this show that are downright unbelievable like the one where the male lead introduces himself and then stands there staring at the FL and her friend like a statue while they talk about him like he's not there, I feel like they forgot to film the part of the scene where he walks away so it seems like he's just standing there staring and not interacting with everyone for minutes after he introduces himself which makes NO sense either as writing or from a direction POV.   \n\n\nIt's the writing of the dates part that is the most offensively bad to me though, 100% of the dialogue is indescribably unbelievably bad in a way I've never seen before. But not 'wacky zany bad' just 'like watching paint dry boring but also unbelievable' bad. No one feels like a character, none of this feels remotely like anything that would ever happen, the characters feel like cardboard cutouts, the dialogue is stilted beyond belief and it doesn't help that the directing/editing looks like a high school project gone wrong.  \n\n\nLiFS was not a good/great show by any means but it had realistic/interesting characters and conversations, the acting was acceptable to good, etc... I don't think the ED story was that bad although the bipolar one was a bit weird but I think with that one they were focusing more on the effect of stress and social ostracism than bipolar itself and making a comment about how hard it is to appear on these shows. At least the show seemed like something that would actually appear on TV. The show-within-a-show in Youngsim would never make it to TV, they don't even have an MC and the dates don't seem like dates.   \n\n\nHim &gt;!winning DDR while not even stepping on the footpads!&lt; was next level, but so was the weird speech about studying compsci because he was interested in neuroscience (?????) because of nightmares (?????) but so was the tonkatsu scene but so was the poet literally &gt;!chucking a sick girl out of a boat into a lake and a person who can't swim jumping after her and pretending to drown even though he's wearing a life jacket and his head is above water the whole time. !&lt;Also why is she so mad about a guy from when she was 14 going to the US that she storms off from the dinner table without eating when his name is mentioned? This literally feels like it was written by a 10 year old.  \n\n\nSorry I'm getting worked up but I've never seen a show this bad in my life and I'm just fascinated by the idea that anyone would consider it objectively better than any 'normal' show with a normal script and plot.",

The length of time the ML stood there silently while they gossiped about him right in front of his face and just. Was stuck there like a statue was so uncomfortable, I can't believe they blocked the scene like this.\n\nThe dates and dating show in general basically convinced me that the FL absolutely deserves to be fired ASAP, she's a PD and she cast all these wet rags for her show and then even when she herself was cast she uh... has no idea how to act on camera and just sits there twiddling her thumbs not knowing how to make conversation or make the show fun at all. OK she's a lost cause fire her.  \n\n\nAlso I agree it feels like a student project, literally. Even how they shot the opening of the dating show felt like it was a debate tournament in a high school gymnasium, what dating show would be shot in this way with people randomly standing at podiums and no MC?",

Have they never watched TV before lol\n\nYeah these were my thoughts exactly... all they needed to do to save this was reshoot an extra take where he walks away or talks to someone else, edit it to happen before/during the time they start talking about him and only show the close shots of them gossiping about him. Instead it cuts back and forth to them talking and longer shots of him standing there staring at them silently for a truly uncomfortable length of time. Also he introduces himself and no one talks to him, like at all. No one is like 'hi' or 'nice to meet you' or 'I'm the director' they're just like .*. ---- .*.\n\nKorean variety shows are so obsessed with MCs though they could have had an MC interacting with the AI or something, it felt very unrealistic and I was also confused because I thought it was going to be a longer dating show, but I guess this was just a single pilot episode of a show that would only have each contestant go on one episode and then a new set of contestants every time? They kind of bait and switched us with the synopsis didn't they.\n\nI think for me actually the worst moments in the script and editing were all the things that happened on the dates, like him &gt;!'winning' DDR while just stepping on the metal parts and someone else's dance pad and not looking at the screen, her asking how he knows DDR if he lived in America (??), the poet throwing the main girl out of a boat like SHOVING HER HARD because she seems to have seasickness, a guy who can't swim and isn't anywhere near her jumping into the water and then pretending to drown while wearing a life vest with his head above water (the only saving grace of this scene was the bit with her trying to save the microphones lol), the entire dialogue between ML and the model where he claims he 'obviously' got a computer science degree and started a fashion company because he was interested in neuroscience - why didn't you study neuroscience then or something related? And then the weird tonkatsu scene where the CEO of an AI startup is like 'I know the menu today' and starts explaining the cafeteria menu like he's a chef lol!&lt; plus let's not even get into how the FL apparently can't even make basic conversation on these dates she just sits there looking away from the other contestant silently and laughing. Is she five?",

I know you didn't watch the whole ep but the 'dating show' part was really anticlimactic and I wonder why it was even included tbh if it wasn't going to be a big part of the show, it didn't really move their relationship forward much or anything.  \n\n\nIt was also really weird bc they just skipped forward to the pilot being aired with no explanation of what happened between filming and airing. I guess maybe they'll tell us later but odd choice",

For instance, her taking away snot under her nose, I don't understand why she would do that as an adult? Some things we did as children, we've stopped doing since it's bad manners... Even her scrunching her face, make her nasolabia folds harsher, expanding her nose flares.. I as an outsider just find it wierd cause I can't relate to something that may have been a typical behaviour of her charachter? \n\nSo I really think this drama has a mainly Korean targeted audience  With that written, yeah the screenplay is frankly rediculous. They are 30 and we should pretend that they are unkissed, inexperienced virgins who where butthurt by something that happend when they where like 9? Are we really going that path? \n\nDonghae is upsetting me. He is such a handsome man, but this role is so basic and boring. I think the only thing that made me raise my intrest was when he smiled cause &gt;!they all choose him.!&lt;\n\nIt's only two episodes so far, but shouldn't a screenplay have some intresting eye-grabbing moments to catch the audience? Lame scenes that are basically selling the idea that she is childish and rather quirky in a dorky, foolish way (it isn't attractive!). I will continue to watch it cause I refuse to believe we are going through two set-backs where two extremly attractive men are playing in bad dramas. Unbreakable bond and this are disappointments. If Lee Junho's next drama also has bad screenplay I'll have to stop focusing on romance dramas. \n\nI am a romantic so this breaks my heart a bit.",

I get that &gt;!she feels misunderstood as a person because of her dad's portrayal of her in his cartoon!&lt; but that doesn't give you the right to mistreat anyone.",

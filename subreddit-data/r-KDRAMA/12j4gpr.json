    "postText": "Welcome to our **Spotlight On** post series where you can share your picks of dramas that deserve the spotlight! Each **Spotlight On** post is focused on a genre or theme, as you can see in the post title. Based on this genre/theme, you are welcome to share your views about dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post, which is:\n\n**Thriller/Suspense**\n\nDramas that create a heightened feeling of suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation, or anxiety. This can involve crime or criminal elements but the difference here is that a cover-up is involved or that a progressive investigation takes center stage, usually towards some thematic climax (the big reveal, villain unmasked, the mystery solved).\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

Usually in other dramas I can guess who\u2019s gonna be the killer and things become slow and obvious after that but not in this. If you\u2019re watching this you\u2019re in for lots of twists and turns. \n\nBad things: Sometimes it can be a little confusing so you\u2019ll have to rewind it a bit. \n\nInteresting things: The characters. Every character has a different story and vibe to them. And Im telling you this, you\u2019ll doubt every single one of them. \n\nSpotlight because: It will keep you on the edge the whole time. This drama doesn\u2019t drag. No filler episodes and is fast paced. And the ending will &gt;!give you a proper closure!&lt; \n\nId give it a 9/10.",

            "comment": "**Inspector Koo** (2021) (Mystery/Dramedy/Thriller): Washed-up cop-turned-insurance-inspector FL ends up in the middle of deadly showdown with her rag-tag team after she uncovers a string of hidden, linked murders.\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The Bechdel test pass. There's no romance, just four distinct and atypical FLs that have complicated and vacillating ties. From FFL's mentoring of her chosen colleagues, TFL's responsibilities to FL and as a single mother to her daughter, SFL's childish dependency on and fierce protection of her loving aunt, and FL's tangled connection to all of them women's relationships with women are front and center.\n* The cat-and-mouse conflicts. All of the characters have different agendas and work with and against each other as the story progresses. While there are clear good guys and bad guys, there's also enough moral ambiguity to keep things interesting and a sympathetic, weirdly-endearing SFL antagonist.\n* The cinematography. All the world's a stage and there are several plays within a play going on at any given time which is reflected in the cleverly framed theatrical interludes.\n* The lack-thereof fashion. FL has an extensive wardrobe of tracksuits and trench coats (with a few variations for more formal occasions). It's partially due to the anxiety and depression, but FL also just refreshingly DGAF.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The loose ends. It's set up for a second season, and while there aren't any major cliffhangers there are some lingering questions that might never get closure.\n* The pacing. Things get mired a bit in the middle while the story arcs are sorted out.\n* The LGBTQ romance. It's a surprisingly sweet side story and you'll root for the couple, but &gt;!they don't exactly get a happy ending and it's a little too close to the bury-your-gays trope for comfort.!&lt;\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* It's screenwriter Sung Cho Yi's first and only Kdrama and was loosely inspired by the UK espionage thriller *Killing Eve*.\n* Lee Young Ae took an extended break after her role as FL in **Jewel in the Palace** (2003). **Samdaing** (2017) and **Inspector Koo** (2021) are her only lead roles since.\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* A thriller with four FLs front and center is rare both in and outside of Kdrama, and IK pulls it off with aplomb. \n\nIt's an 8.5/10 from me. Recommended if you enjoyed other FL-centric thrillers like *Killing Eve* or *Orphan Black*, prefer a healthy dose of black comedy in a high-stakes story and don't mind a few question marks at the end.",

            "comment": "**W** (2016) (Scfi/Fantasy/Romance/Thriller): FL crosses into a parallel world that coincides with a webtoon her father writes; ML is the main character, who's becoming aware of unsettling discrepancies in his life as he seeks justice for his family's murder.\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The big budget production. It looks and feels much more modern than its 2016 air date would suggest. \n* The high concept premise. The sheer existential horror of the man vs god / creation vs creator set-up that drives the early episodes is a powerful hook. It also toys with related concepts like Ship of Theseus, paradoxical free will, and Zeno's Arrow (&gt;!in relation to time travel!&lt;) to name a few. \n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The romance. It starts with some unique dynamics - namely FL saving ML who we find out later &gt;!she created as her perfect boyfriend in a reverse Pygmalion/Galetea!&lt; - but they're never explored and it becomes one of the textbook cases of 'We're together because we're the leads'. You don't really get to see ML and FL build a relationship; they're just thrown into high-stakes circumstances one after another with interludes of sweetness/melodrama.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The adrenaline fatigue. After a while, the impact of the constant revelations and cliffhangers is hollow, especially since the consequences and implications of earlier situations are often forgotten entirely or glossed over by deus ex machina.\n* The lack of internal consistency. Instead of relying on the rules it sets up early on, it continually makes up new ones that contradict both themselves and each other.\n* The Jenga-esque plot. There's several key elements that easily could have provided enough material for an entire drama, but they're tossed aside in favor of more and more makjang twists; which results in major holes as well as an undeveloped central thematic narrative. It ultimately tries to do too much with too little foundation.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* Song Jae Jung also wrote Queen In Hyun's Man (2012), Nine: Nine Times Time Travel (2013) and Memories of the Alhambra (2018).\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* Scifi/fantasy thrillers are rare in Kdrama and stories that actually engage with it as a subject matter vs using it as a backdrop are few and far between. Compared to genre at large W isn't a standout and it has some serious flaws, but it's worth watching for its (mostly thwarted) ambitions.\n\nIt's a 7/10 from me. Recommended if you enjoy fast paced thrillers or glossy high-concept stories and are looking for rollercoaster don't-think-too-hard binge watch.",

                    "comment": "I dropped W while it was airing. I remember though, how fresh and novel the idea whole idea of the drama felt. I\u2019m not entirely sure why I dropped it though, but you highlight extremely valid points. Perhaps it was the inconsistency - the making up rules as it goes part. The beauty of a fantasy world is that there are certain limitations to the abilities of the main leads. When there\u2019s too much plotshield\u2026 it lowers the ability of me to digest it any further.",

Often the ML and FL were two people reciting lines at each other. They were so wooden and even their sweet scenes were performative. Han Hyo Joo is gorgeous and I was distracted by her beauty and kept thinking about how superior her  romance with PHS was in Happiness.  I think the romance felt flat because her character here was one-dimensional.\n\nTo add, the actor playing the dad and his later alter ego was brilliant and his acting was a highlight. That was a highlight of the latter part of the series.\n\nThis was enjoyable from a novelty perspective but so much potential wasted!",

Although, yes, &gt;!I think Ha Joon moving into Do Gi's building is sus too!&lt; but I just refuse to believe that the director and writer would allow this clich\u00e9 especially hinting at it so early \ud83d\ude24\n\nOr! What if Ha Joon IS a spy planted by the yet-to-be-revealed villain but he turns on his bad boss because he's touched by the Rainbow team? When he crashed his taxi, he expected Jang Sung Chul to reprimand him or demand for compensation but the first thing Sung Chul asked was if he was alright and whether he had gone to the hospital, and we see that Ha Joon was a little surprised by that. He learnt in this ep that the company is a safe space for children in need of help like Seo Yeon, and he took the initiative to buy her new clothes. And we learn in this episode that &gt;!he probably grew up in a difficult environment.!&lt; Maybe he was a troubled child/teen who fell into wrong hands for survival, and he joined Rainbow Taxi for the bad guy's scheme, but the Rainbow team's warmth and kindness touch him and as things play out against the team, he joins hands with them and goes against the bad guy.",

I'd much rather &gt;!he was a neglected/kidnapped child!&lt; and has his own trauma to deal with in the show, but I feel like he could be a villain too. He's too curious and &gt;!he even moved into Doki\u2019s apartment and tried to (maybe unintentionally) distract Goeun when someone was clicking her pictures and he knows a lot about real estate. I have a theory that he could be someone who works with Mr. Kang, but hope that's not true.!&lt; I\u2019d like it more if he helps the team out because of his real estate knowledge. \ud83d\udc80",

He purposely came to Go Eun to distract her from the car, kept looking outside again and again after it had left to make sure. Definitely heavy sus. Although i am not sure about his intentions with the kid or whether he is a good or a bad guy. The opening theme scene does suggest he is.!&lt; \n2. &gt;! The car photographer had the same kind of ring that Pil Sung is wearing later in the private consultation scene. I am not sure how much is the photographer connected to Pil Sung considering Go Eun was looking an apartment at the start of the episode. So is someone specifically tailing her. Idk. But again heavy sus!&lt; \n3. Here's what i think the story line is this season. &gt;! I think there's some organisation or an underground mafia of some sorts whose members wear a special type of ring on their little finger. The photographer and Pil Sung belong to them. I won't be surprised if the Police Captain was also connected to it.!&lt;  Let's see how it goes along. But this is my hunch.",

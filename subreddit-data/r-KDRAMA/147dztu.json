The pacing of the drama feels just about right and the way they take us 1-on-1 in the scene with Lee Ro-um to understand her plan, it's a good addition to the drama.\n\nAnd of course there was &gt;!more to the connection between Ro-um and Lawyer Han than we were able to see, no wonder they kept showing us glimpses of his backstory. But how is this guy going to cope when he finds out the truth.!&lt;",

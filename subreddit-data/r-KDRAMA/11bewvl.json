            "comment": "Oof I miss when it was fun to come here and share in everyone\u2019s excitement! Lots of disappointed viewers here today \u2639\ufe0f I\u2019m just going to blame the terrible mislabelling of this kdrama as a romcom for giving people the wrong expectations, and/or appealing to the wrong audience. As others have mentioned, the English title was a terrible decision. They probably opted against a direct translation of the Korean title (One Shot Scandal) because it contains wordplay that doesn\u2019t carry over. But still, it was such a poor choice to put romance in the English title - that was never the focus. \n\nI don\u2019t see this as a romcom with too many side plots, the _main_ plot is \u201cthe cutthroat world of private education\u201d as per the Netflix tagline. Everything stems from the flashback scenes when CCY\u2019s student\u2019s mother entangled them in a cheating scandal. That student\u2019s suicide ignited something in her brother, leading him down the miserable path to where we find him now. It also changed the course of CCY\u2019s life. He blamed himself, and his friend blamed him too. People abandoned him, he put up walls and focussed on his career, winding up isolated and lonely. \n\nWith the rate of student suicides increasing, the show is saying \u201cy\u2019all have not learned a damned thing\u201d. Parents are still pushing their kids to the brink, and in a society where so much hinges on which university you get into, the wealthy continue to have all the power. The home room teacher said it best in episode 2: \u201cit\u2019s not us that has to change, it\u2019s the system\u201d. That\u2019s the scandal. Now bringing it back to our ML, thanks to batshit lawyer mum, he\u2019s embroiled in the same scenario again. But this time how will it play out? More positively, I hope. Hae-E has shown herself to have integrity and a strong will, which is at least in part thanks to NHS\u2019 love and care. CCY is tougher and wiser now, and he\u2019s no longer alone, he\u2019s got some fierce women on his side! I\u2019ve really enjoyed all angles of this story. The underlying theme is heavy, and nicely balanced by the cute and fun moments. The tonal shifts haven\u2019t been jarring to me in the way they have for others, but I\u2019m no expert when it comes to film making - just a satisfied viewer. \n\nOh this is such a long comment, it wasn\u2019t even my aim to try changing anyone\u2019s mind but here I am \ud83d\ude05 _Anyway,_ the take home is I still really love this drama, I think it\u2019s been done really well and the entire cast have been excellent \ud83e\udd13 I can understand fans of pure romcom being disappointed but I actually like this weird mix of mystery/thriller/romcom/social commentary \ud83e\udd79",

As a frequent viewer of on going kdramas, this is around the time some viewers start to hate on the show and feel blindsided by everything and nitpick at everything. I can admit the English time does not fit the show as well as the Hangul one directly translated. \n\nBUT i don't think it takes away from the story at all. The murder plot has been here all along and it's coming full steam ahead as it should to finish off. And there's a formula that most kdramas follow. It's following it well.\n\nI really love this drama too and think it's an excellent piece of work for what it is and the actors have really shown their skills.",

It was needed to move the plot along, but I'm glad it's over.\n\n&gt;!The sneaking into her room and giggling like teenagers.  !&lt;Adorable.  And Jae Woo being third wheel to CCY and NHS was hilarious.\n\nIt's a race to the bottom for which mom is the worst.  Sun Jae or Soo Ah's. I'm glad big brother  Hee Jae finally stood up to mom and called her out on her nonsense, and was there for his Sun Jae.  I'm hoping those two boys can break free from both their awful parents.  But she &gt;!finds out HaeE is missing and has zero reaction? And then lies about it?  And uses the manipulative 'fine put your mom in the hospital'  All because she gets what she wants and who cares about anyone else?   Like Hae E said, she's doing it all for herself and doesn't have faith that he's going to pass but hope Sun Jae does the right thing and comes clean to the powers that be.  Who wants to win on those terms?   I think the teacher friend would step up and help him get through it. !&lt;\n\nAnd Su A-I feel bad for you, but you've been so awful the entire show that I wish the writers had written you to be more sympathetic.  I know it's because her mom is awful, but compare her to Sun Jae and how he's overcome it. &gt;!  Legit woman your daughter is sobbing that she's a monster and all you can do is yell at her?!&lt;  I'm glad the other moms are ditching her mean girl self.\n\nI'm not a fan of this &gt;!romance plot line with Jae Woo and Young Joo.  People on the spectrum can find true love and that's important to show-!&lt;but the way it's written here is just off putting and doesn't make sense. A rare miss for this show.\n\nMr. Ji we all knew it was you since episode one, and the cop knows it to.  Th&gt;!e only satisfaction I got was NHS calling him out.  And CCY noticed the difference in reaction.  She acknowledged that Ji's important to CCY and didn't bad mouth him, while Ji try to make her sound unhinged and awful.!&lt;\n\nHopefully that entire story line gets wrapped up tomorrow since the cops are hopefully &gt;!onto Ji now (please don't make it where they think it's CCY that's the murderer)!&lt;",

I have only recently allowed myself to stop masking my autism as much (a mask that required extreme social avoidance to even partially maintain) and the fear that I will no longer be seen as an adult in the eyes of the world is all-consuming. The inclusion of this plot-line offers me a small reassurance against that. \n\nI do still wish that they'd written his character and struggles to include more of his perspective from the beginning, instead of mostly being shown through their effects on his family. I also wonder if this would have made the current plot-line less jarring to other viewers. However, the bottom line is this show gave me a character like me who is treated as a worthy object of romantic desire, so right now I'm willing to forgive a lot. \n\n(and I will also be avoiding...basically all the comments here lol, since the plot-line is unpopular, to say the least)",

I'm a psychologist who has worked with autistic young adults and wrote a comment earlier about not being a fan of the love line and the way NHS often treats Jae-Woo like a child, but after reading your perspective, I understand it a bit more now. I absolutely love how we were able to see Jae-woo's internal dialogue today. So I agree with you-- I think if they had shown his perspective from the beginning, the plot line wouldn't have felt so random. But I am glad that you were able to resonate with this plot line. Thank you for sharing and helping me see a different pov.",

I wish they showed this more and did not dismiss him so much.  So often he had things to say but he was shut down.  Not much left in the show to explore this angle\n\nThere were so many plot lines that would have been more appropriate and not such a bad fit for a romcom.  This is one of them.\n\nThe reason everyone reacted badly to the romance is that it was almost predatory.  If the genders were inversed, people would have had a meltdown.  Anyway, the issue is that they are family, and this is why people reacted so strongly.  And this is why Jae-Woo rejected her so strongly.  I could totally see Jae-Woo developing feelings for someone, but it would have to be done delicately, over time, just like the romance between HS and CCY was portrayed.",

The social commentary has always been a noticeable presence throughout the show - even before the last couple of episodes - so the pivot in tone didn't catch me off guard. The sort of cutthroat behaviors exhibited by Sun-jae's mother and Su-a may be slight exaggerations but are totally plausible.

But seriously, what are these moms doing to these poor kids? Its just ridiculous at this point.

The trauma inflicted by these families is no joke.\n\nAnd the MVP of the show is Hae-yi without a doubt. To stand up to Sun-jae's mom the way she did took serious courage. She's shown that she is head and shoulders above most of the adults in this show. Of all the people she deserves a happy ending the most.",

Unfortunately, I think due to the way episode 12 was set up they had to make many things come to fold in this episode. There was too much left up in the air for them not to have a slightly crazy episode 13. Glad they didn\u2019t break up! That what usually happens this episode.\n\nThe two side plots that I really do think are to the detriment of the show are &gt;!Jae Woo and Yeong Ju it just doesn\u2019t work this late in the show!&lt; and &gt;!Su A visions of hurting Hae Yi!&lt;. Even though she\u2019s clearly needing help it\u2019s hard to sympathize with her character also I feel like her story is on again off again depending on the week? The moms are a waste of screen time too sometimes, doesn\u2019t really move the plot forward for me.\n\nI felt like despite the chaos of this week, I feel like we still had some endearing CCY and NHS scenes that seem to be lost in the frustration of the murder subplot. Also the extremely tender CCY &amp; Jae Woo scene like don\u2019t forget about these moments because the writing sometimes fall apart with the side characters. I noticed some comments about JKH acting and honestly I don\u2019t think JKH acting was any different this episode he\u2019s still king of micro expressions, and his chemistry with the lead stands.\n\nWhile this show has gone in a different direction then I imagined or liked, I hoping for a Touch your Heart type of ending, where\u2019s it just cutesy shit for the last two episodes next week.

It actually shows the small things we kinda take for granted. Their budding friendship, and CCY actually coming to considering him as a brother (when he goes \"why? why? why?\" to Jae Woo) and then whole \"a secret between men\" thing is SO SWEET. And CCY instantly understood JW when they met again after the disastrous first encounter (i.e. he didn't need to be told about him being different, something that was sooooo oblivious to the waffle lady &amp; her bf). Yes, NHS &amp; CCY but CCY &amp; JW &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n\n&gt; I don\u2019t think JKH acting was any different this episode he\u2019s still king of micro expressions, and his chemistry with the lead stands.\n\n100% omg the microexpressions!

            "comment": "Similar to others here, I'm feeling a bit disappointed. I immediately fell so hard for this show. I recognized I had high expectations because Hometown Cha Cha Cha and WFKBJ are in my ultimate top 5. I blabbered about how amazing this show was to *everyone.* But today's episode with all the side plots really took a turn. My feels started with Ep12, so there was less excitement for Ep13 and more apprehension, which continues to grow after finishing the episode. Also, to be honest, my thoughts are so muddled, so I've rewritten this a few times to try to be coherent and to not write a novel.\n\nI understand watching a show requires a little bit of letting go of reality, but as a psychologist, there's a few things I'm struggling with. Like how autism is being depicted in this show with NHS' continuous infantilization of Jae-Woo, and now this sudden love line that feels like shoddy writing. I also can't fully get on board with Su-a's apparent dyslexic symptoms that I guess was actually stress induced psychosis / visual hallucinations that's all turning into rage. While yes, emotions left unchecked, including shame and insecurity, can turn ugly -- the sudden fantasies &gt;!of pushing Hae-yi!&lt; also feels like a writing cop-out. \n\nI will say, I do understand Sun-jae's behaviors in this episode. It makes sense from a human behavior perspective. My overly empathetic heart aches for him though. Not just because of his parents, but because of how much it must have hurt him to &gt;!finish his exam, turn it in, and then sit with how this impacted Hae-yi. To know that he was going to confess after the exam, but now probably feels like he is so unworthy of her, of course he's going to push her away. Oof. The path to repair for the two of them is intense.!&lt; He was a strong, good kid that overcame so much to be who he is, but this may very well break him.\n\nOverall though, the side plots feel really hollow and forced to be significant to only detract from the main plot lines. Which leaves me sad. And worried this ship can't self-correct and find itself back on the crash course to romance journey...",

All the underlying emotions we know exist and now &gt;! Hae-i is hurt !&lt; and he's not going to know why. It made me wonder what the mom has done to older brother and whether she's pushing Sun-jae down the same path. The scene with Hui-jae trying to comfort him was so sad.\n\nThe Jae-woo romance storyline is just wrong. They depicted Young-ju as \"man crazy\" and a bit ditzy but having known them for such a long time she would know better and it was completely unnecessary.",

I can see Sun-jae giving up, especially if hypothetically Hae-yi &gt;!doesn't recover or forgive him!&lt;. He could easily question, \"What's the point?\" The mom never taught either son what the point was, just that they had to these things. She manipulated them. I think whatever coping skills Sun-jae had was because of Hui-Jae. Like he learned how to navigate the system (both school and his family) by learning from Hui-jae's experience.\n\nThe scene between Hui-jae and Sun-jae was beautiful. So sad, and so beautiful. Sun-jae's tears. and Hui-jae's silent, comforting hand. I'm so glad they have each other.\n\nRegarding Jae-woo's romance... agreed. Also I want to clarify that the reason I think it's not strong is because the writing is not strong and because of how they depicted Young-ju throughout the show. Not because of Jae-woo's autism. For both of them, it really could have been a \"wow what I've been looking for has been under my nose this whole time!\", but to really make it work, there has to be more instances than just \"oh I wanted someone this tall...and oh jae-woo is tall? and is helpful and supportive?? oh okay, well, yeah let's date him then.\" I totally get Young-ju's loneliness, especially as she sees her best friend date. But, the reasons just aren't there...",

Him trying to suss out if Jae Woo was sleeping had me on the floor. That scene reminded me of the light heartedness of the show.\n\nHim calling her noona was so funny. \n\nI also loved how CCY was there for NHS when she was looking for Hae-e. They just seemed like such a close knit family. I am so glad she has someone to support her.\n\nCons\n\nEverything else going on in this episode.\n\nI wish the writers had chosen the serial killer storyline OR the overbearing mothers/cheating scandal. Not both. There is no balance now and it's all just too heavy as compared to the previous tone of the show.\n\nSun jae's mom is just a horrible person, it's not enough that she's ruined her children, she now has to make other people's lives miserable. There's just so much to unpack there but we only have three episodes left, there's not enough time.\n\nI don't like how Sun Jae reacted to the Hae-e trying to  speak with him. That was coward behavior, unfair of him and I'm no longer rooting for him and Hae-e.\n\nSu-a has rage issues and she needs help urgently. Her mom is just as bad as SJ's so chances of her receiving the help she needs are slim to none.\n\nWhatever they're trying to sell us with Jae Woo x Yeong Ju, I'm not buying it. I will happily skip those scenes without any guilt.\n\nMr Ji. Sigh.\nIs there a parallel to Sua x Mr Ji? How their parents obsession with school forced them to have blinding rage which in Mr Ji's case made him murder his mom? Could be the same scenario with Sua...\n\nCCY should've done more when NHS called Mr Ji out. He should've taken her side. I know it's complex but I also think it's not? Especially with him being caught red handed.\n\nI hope they wrap up this murder storyline in the next episode so that we can at least go back to a character driven show. \n\nI hope this show ends well so that I can rewatch it again after its done airing. It became one of my favorite shows ever, I hope it doesn't get ruined.",

I started this series because I loved Jung Kyung-ho in HosPlay and Prison Playbook and was eager to see him in a romcom along with The Jeon Do-yeon. The actors did total justice to the romcom because it's like they revived adult romcoms and making them a ratings hit. But I still feel like they don't get enough credit because right from Youtube to other social media I keep seeing more discourse on the minor love triangle between the kids. I'm just hoping we see more romcoms starring actors in their 40s in future(without murder subplots). \n\nThe murder plot has always been a sore thumb and now with Dong-hui confirmed to be the murderer I just hope it doesn't overshine the romance. It needs a proper conclusion that DOESN'T involve a breakup between the leads. \n\nNam Hae-yi is my most fav teen character in recent times because she is kind and still not act like a doormat. I like that she seems disinterested in both the boys and wish it's kept like that. She only gives platonic vibes with the boys. \n\nThe tiger moms almost ruined the romcom for me but still I want a scene where they're all put in their places by Nam Haeng-seon or Choi Chi-yeol. I'd hate it if they just get away with no consequences, even more than the breakup scene. \n\nI'm still not sure of the love line between Jae-woo and Young-joo so I'm giving it more time. \n\nAbove all I wish int he end Chi-yeol opens his own institute where he can function independently or even better if he becomes a simple teacher. Married to Haeng-seon who sends off a happy Hae-yi to college.",

I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nI know a lot of people hate the murder subplot and think it doesn't belong anywhere near this show, but tbh, since it's been part of the drama since the beginning, I don't mind it. I was dismayed at first, but realized at least by the end of episode four that it wasn't going anywhere. Personally, I like the way the seeds the writer planted in the first few episodes are coming to fruition now, and the way what happened with Chi-yeol's student in the past is paralleling Hae-yi and Sun-jae's situation. I do expect them to have a better outcome this time around. \n\n&gt;!I also feel sorry for Su-a, even though she's a pain. And I liked that her mom was frozen out by the other moms. It was deserved. !&lt;\n\nI also wonder if Haeng-seon will in fact be the person to &gt;!take Ji Dong-hee down. She pointed out that she has better eyesight than others in this episode. One of my few nitpicks of this show is that we didn't get a lot of insight into her life pre-Hae-yi, but it would make sense if her athletic past plays a role in the murder subplot climax.!&lt;\n\nMy tolerance for the murder subplot aside, I do want more romance between Haeng-seon and Chi-yeol. Plus, since &gt;!they had a quasi-breakup this episode (well, if you squint) I'm hoping we'll be spared a real/longer breakup or separation, though now that I've said that, I've probably jinxed it.!&lt;\n\nNow to impatiently wait for tomorrow's episode.",

Not necessarily,  but one does have to acknowledge that if this was the main plot of a murder mystery, it would be quite an interesting watch. Mr Ji is a unique villain in comparison to the typical kdrama villains. \n\nFirst, he's good-looking and blends in rather well as your average nice  assistant. Typically,  the villains are dressed in black with a hoodie or hat, which makes it extremely obvious for the viewer to identify the villain and not form an attachment to them. Here we see Mr. J wearing light colored clothing and being supportive to the ML. It's not until the later eps that he switches to darker clothing. \n\nSecond, his mannerisms. This is what makes him such a great TV villain. He doesn't sneer or make open threats. He's in the shadows and wears a mask of \"normality.\" This is what makes him truly terrifying because he's able to adapt to his surroundings by participating in games, dinners, and interactions with others. This is a realistic take on villains.  How many of us have experienced or heard others' experiences on someone everybody knew and would generally agree they were your \"average nice guy\", only to be shocked when their true nature and heinous actions were revealed. Many real-life victims who were targeted have stated that their attacker seemed normal and even charming. \n\nJust my thoughts on the mystery side of things \u26ab\ufe0f \n\nAlso,  I hope that when everyone finds out that Mr. JI caused &gt;!Haeas accident!&lt; that her 3 friends will be the ones to  beat the living daylights out of him, and hockey guy can round up his teammates to help in the beating of Mr. Ji just for kicks!",

It\u2019s strange because I enjoyed it at first: great lead actors with strong performances can overcome even the most predictable, contrived scripts. \n\nI think my main problem with the show is that while I love the main characters and some of the education plotline, there are so many things that simply aren\u2019t fun to watch. \n\nI don\u2019t need every scene to be \u201cfun\u201d, of course, but there\u2019s this huge tonal whiplash from scene to scene that doesn\u2019t quite work. Between the romance, the irritating mothers, the incredibly stupid murder plotline (which feels like it\u2019s from another show), the tertiary stories, etc\u2026 it\u2019s all over the place. \n\nA tighter script over 10-12 episodes would\u2019ve been the sweet spot IMO. Cut the murders, scale the interpersonal conflicts down, create some sympathetic side characters or two dimensional antagonists instead, etc. and you would have an even better show. \n\nRegardless, those leads are so good I have a feeling I\u2019ll still tune in.

I don\u2019t mind the drama about education stuff, since it ties in with the education theme of the show. I\u2019ve also found the plot line of the overbearing mother and how her obsession with her kids\u2019 education is costing their and her\u2019s sanity to be quite compelling and well done. \n\n\nBut I think cutting out the murder plot, decreasing the time spent with the awful mum\u2019s group (or at the very least, making them more rounded characters), would have made this a solid romantic comedy drama show. It\u2019s only the leads\u2019 performance that have kept this compelling for me. I saw another point on the black and white morality of the characters and I feel it\u2019s another issue.",

It had all elements - wholesome moments with family (sunjae + hui jae, choi chi yeol making a \"secret\" with jae woo, yeongju noticing something's really off with nam haeng seon and giving her space), GOOD progression with the murder mystery, antagonists doing their thing (sua's mum being edged out, sunjae's mom meeting with hae-e, dong hui being outed, etc), ROMANCE (with ccy trying to sneak into nhs' room, watching cute videos together, and showing up for her when hae-e went missing (although here nhs was a little wrong in not calling him herself))\n\nAnd no, I REALLY despise the Yeongju-jaewoo story arc. It's unnecessary and they can move on from this right now. \n\nI'm still waiting to see how the sua arc develops. If they just leave it as is, it's weird. I want to see if all these destructive thoughts that she's having, lead to something else.\n\nAlso, LOVE the conflict they introduced between our leads and between the kids and between sunjae and his mom. Love it!\n\nDid you guys know that they're releasing two books on Crash Course in Romance which contains the unedited script, signed autographs of the lead couple, interviews, notes and other deets?\n\nI'd LOVE to buy except I can't read korean as well(at least now, and I just started with Hangul last week). Was wondering if we could petition them to publish and english translation haha!!\n\nLooking forward to Ep 14! :) This was a really good episode and I enjoyed it thoroughly!\n\nPS - Haeng Seon's giggles are SO cute. She IS a teenager in love! So so CUTE!!\n\nPPS - ALSO HOW DARE DONG HUI GO AFTER HAE-E SHE'S A LITERAL CHILD. JUST ...HOW?",

He definitively killed his mother.\n\nPsychopaths are all about controlling their victims and this is what he has been doing successfully for the past few years.  Controlling and isolating him to the point where CCY basically does everything he wants.  Anyone that came between him and his control of CCY, either positively or negatively made themselves a target.  Now it's HS and Nae-e turn because their influence is growing.\n\nBut it looks from the preview, that CCY has finally realized some of this and has turned against him.  So I think that CCY is probably the biggest target right now.  Psychopaths do not tolerate their victims getting away from them.",

She also didn't let CCY dissuade her from the truth or try to make him choose sides. So often you see these kinds of confrontations dissolve into chaos and create more misunderstandings. But she knows what she saw and what she feels and steps back to let them both process it all. You love to see it.\n\nHer outfit, however. I personally hate turtlenecks and don't think anyone ever looks good in one, so it was very distracting to me during the whole scene haha. It's so weirdly high and lacy! They did her dirty with those pants too. And her whole layered pajama look was confusing me as well. She is very beautiful but those clothes are doing her no favors.

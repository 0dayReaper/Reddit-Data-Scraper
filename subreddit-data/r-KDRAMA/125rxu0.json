Solid ending, solid communication (nothing misunderstood or festering besides Ki Tae's anxiety which he communicated about promptly), solid skinship (butt pats and spit during a kiss?), actors totally comfortable with one another which totally sold the relationship (i.e. doing normal couple things). I really wish it wasn't so short though they did a great job with pacing and story with the run time they did have. I am so sad to see this end but am very impressed with it.

It\u2019s honestly probably the #1 Korean BL I\u2019ve seen, and their chemistry is better than most on screen couples I\u2019ve watched.\n\nI loved the acting from both, especially Lee Seung Gyu as Ki Tae. The littler glances, smirks, and laughs told so much, but also his emotions in episode 7.\n\nOf course I think a bit more time could fill in some gaps, like how Ki Tae found Wan at that company in the final episode, what happened after the soccer field, etc. And they both need to learn to text each other more lol. But even so, it was a fantastic show that didn\u2019t waste time and shows why direct communication is amazing.\n\nThe little part with the webtoon at the end, and how they\u2019ve loved each other for 7 years made me tear up a bit. I really felt these two love each other.\n\nI\u2019m going to miss this show, but I will have fun watching it over and over. 10/10.",

            "comment": "What a comforting little show. I went in expecting nothing and I was completely won over.\nRomance is, I believe, one of the hardest genre to pull off, and it was executed so nicely here, with so few episodes, and with such simplicity. It really goes to show sometimes the simplest story, when executed well and with sincerity, can go a long way. The characters were adorable, and had just enough depth to keep me interested and engaged. Honestly for such a short runtime, it's impressive.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the acting. The two leads have that little extra something that really sells it. I'm having trouble explaining it, but the dialogue was smooth, and the direction natural--like, it had that \"unrehearsed\" vibe which is my absolute favorite. I swear it's not that common.\n\nAlso appreciated that intimacy and love was shown through way more than just The Kiss\u2122. They casually hold hands, hug, tease each other, and generally act like a lovey dovey couple that just got together--that's, weirdly, a breath of fresh air. Even in mainstream kdramas, I have trouble understanding why we (almost) never get to be shown the domesticity of two people in love after they get together. That's like, the best part??? It might be stupid, but I like that they just show affection for each other and it's not the focus point; it never feels staged.\n\nThe transitions were a little choppy and even jarring sometimes, because the episodes were so short, so I feel like we lost out on some interesting pivotal moments but... that's practically nothing compared to the good stuff that was delivered. It was full of small details which are going to be delightful on a rewatch and which add a much needed dimension to these types of mini-dramas.In fact the show was full of little nothings, enough of them to build everything else into something really good.",

Their micro expressions and body languages elevated the simple story for the show. This could easily fall flat without their nuanced acting. Also, their chemistry is off the chart!

I'm guilty of this 100% but I saw this show as just a really good drama. The acting was on point and not BL Cringe (just me?), no throwaway fan service and is just a really wholesome story.\n\nThe story is short, simple and definitely effective. The leads brought it to life but the supporting cast had as much personality as the mains and is not just fodder, ofc they have less screen time but they were all so well characterized, not just slotted in for world building. It shows how the production team thought of every detail. I won't go further as people in this thread are sure to make my other points for me lol. Teamwork guys!!!\n\nThis show has a special place in my heart now and I'm hoping for more mainstream projects for both of these guys.\n\n&gt;!That anxiety attack scene was so relatable as someone who has repressed anxiety popping in and out of my life. We have different triggers but it's definitely like that.!&lt;",

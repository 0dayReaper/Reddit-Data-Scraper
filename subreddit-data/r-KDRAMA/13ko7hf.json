    "postText": "What are some of the best villains you have seen in a K-drama?  \n\nVillains are difficult.  You love to hate them, but they have to be well-written and well-acted in order to avoid portraying them as cartoon villains. The best-written villains are written in such a way that you understand what motivates them, although you can't approve of their actions.  It's a tough role to play, as the actor needs to imbue their characters with something that draws in the viewer and repels them, at the same time.\n\nWhich villains did you almost feel sorry for?  Or those that you hated with the passion of a thousand dying suns?\n\nI just finished watching **Dali and Cocky Prince**.  It had a great villain.  &gt;!A psychopath/narcissist in the classic sense.  I am reminded of the conversation he had with Da-li when he pretty much acts as if they are going to get married, disregarding what she felt about it.  He outlines a future for her, where she will work at an art gallery of his choice, funded by his money, replace her trusted lawyer with one of his, and basically divorce her from the life she built for herself and the people that supports her.  I couldn't help thinking that it was the classic behaviour of an abuser.  Isolate your victim in order to control them.  Oh boy did she dodge a bullet when he called off the wedding the first time.!&lt;  \n\nAnother memorable villain was in **Suspicious Partner**.  He was so well fleshed out.  You hated him, but you almost felt sympathy.  *Almost*, but not quite.  The actor that played him was really good.  Didn't help that the DramaBean writer who wrote the recap was half in love with him.  \n\n**I hear your voice** had a really amazing villain.  His motivations were clear and transparent.  He just took a wrong turn, and there was no coming back.  I love how it ended.  It was satisfying.\n\n**Alchemy of souls.**  Wins the prize for the most hated villain. He was pretty much a cartoon villain, but boy did I want to see him dropped in a vat of boiling oil. &gt;!Special shout-out to the actor who played him after he swapped bodies.  It was uncanny how he adopted his expressions!&lt;\n\n**The Law Cafe**.  He was delightfully chaotic.  You could just sense the chaotic energy simmering below the surface.  The drama showed us what made him the way he was and you couldn't help but feel sorry for him.  But he was clearly on a fast track to hell.\n\n**Crash Course in Romance**.  The villain was only revealed near the end, although most suspected who he was.  The actor played him in such a sincere way, I refused to believe it until the very end.  I wouldn't call him that well-written, because although his motivations were clear, the reason made more or less sense.  But he won my heart until he didn't.\n\nEDIT: Just a few words for clarity",

He also was largely responsible for &gt;!FL's dad dying!&lt; and got away with zero consequences.\n\n\nMost impactful villain for me is the &gt;!two serial killers!&lt; in **Flower of Evil**.\nI hated ML's &gt;!biological dad. The way he groomed his son to be his murder partner, all the shit he put his children through and the trauma they ended up basically never dealing with because of him was horrific!&lt;. His actions made me feel incredibly sad for both his children and the victims. \n\nThe &gt;!second murderer/the real Baek Hee-Sung!&lt; endlessly creeps me out and I can never believe this actor in other roles now. Absolutely sinister and psychotic. The scene where &gt;!the housekeeper tells the mom she wants to quit and he just slowly rises up from his chair and kills her while the mom just watches was horrific. As was the scene where the mom goes out to him in the back yard with the box of thumbnails. His relationship with his mom is a whole other aspect of creepiness. She witnessed him attempting to bury a half dead man and mudrder her long term housekeeper and still did nothing. I know she was responsible for his coma, but to me, she and her husband are also villains in this drama.!&lt;",

Then, he easily gets sucked into a cult and drags his family into it. So far, not great, but one could still understand how all of that could happen.\n\nWhen another disaster strikes, though, he goes all on on the villain scale for me. He refuses to acknowledge his wife's illness and the fact that the cult is making it worse, and he refuses to believe his daughter. \n\nAfter he gets a little bit of power within the cult, though, he becomes the embodiment of evil. He becomes physically abusive, and basically pawns his daughter off to a middle-aged sociopath for a little glory. \n\nHe is everything a father shouldn't be because of his pride.\n\nThe actor who played him did such a good job that I have a visceral reaction when I see him in other shows.",

I don't like wishy-washy villains or those who seek salvation easily, but rather those who act with conviction. I also like villains who are smart, and where the writing fully explores their psyche or motivations. I also prefer when they're sociopaths or psychopaths.\n\nMouse, in particular the kid actor (Kim Kang-hoon) who was the villain for most of the movie, was one of the best villains I've seen portrayed, and probably the best psychotic serial killer depicted in a kdrama. That scene where he was in the church declaring himself to be superior to a deity was absolute perfection. Also, while Si-wan's character was the protagonist for 90% of the series, I think it's quite obvious his character is now a heinous serial killer, meaning the entire story of Strangers from Hell explored his full descent into madness and the changes to his psyche. \n\nHonestly, get Kim Kang-hoon and Si-Wan into another serial killer series and we'll have the ultimate perfection in our hands\n\nAs you've probably guessed, my favourite Kdramas tend to be those that are extremely dark or disturbing or explore the human psyche in some way (It's Okay to Not Be Okay)",

Like he killed the pets of his stepfather out of pettiness, not because he enjoyed killing. He also killed a rabbit and tried to kill a mouse out of curiosity not because he wanted to torture, it's like innocent murder in a way? As he is trying to find out how he feels and why people have a different set of emotions than him.

Their evil deeds are well-motivated and you can kind of relate and see how anyone one do the same thing in that situation.\n\n&gt;!It also has a really neat arc where a good guy turns into a villain and a villain turns into a good guy. It starts with a sweet boyfriend getting appointed as a state prosecutor and proposing to the FL, but then a little later accidentally runs over a woman while they're driving. His first step toward evil is not calling an ambulance for the woman (who would have lived if he did, plus she was pregnant), and lying to his GF and saying there's no one there and they drive off. When the police track her down as a suspect, she wants to protect him so she lies and says she was drive and she was the one that hit the woman. Then the fiance becomes more and more evil as he secretly does things to keep her in jail. And the dead woman's boyfriend was a chaebol and he started using all his power to take revenge on the FL.!&lt;",

I was a little less sold on her older version.\n\nIn a similar vein I liked the villains from **King of Pigs** and **Weak Hero** as well because they were a lot more understandable/nuanced than the typical villain characters, and you even wanted to root for them to some small degree while still hating everything they did, which is a difficult balance to pull off.\n\nAnother great one is the 2 main villains from **Save Me!** They were pretty much opposite characters from another (one the very fake-nice charismatic preacher character, the other a typical kind of 'thug') but both actors were amazing in their roles and made you actually scared that they would outsmart the main characters rather than always being a step behind. I rarely remember being this NERVOUS and WORRIED that a villain would 'win' or seriously harm main characters which was amazing for them to pull off imo.\n\nBut I think probably my top two favourite villains are the villains from **Pied Piper** and **Liar Game** (same writer so this is probably why they're both tied for top for me) because they're both sort of 'morally grey' characters with understandable motivations, AND they are both extremely charismatic and played by extremely experienced, skilled actors. These were 'love to hate but love to love also' characters that I almost wanted to 'win' by the end of the show and in many ways outshone the main characters in their respective shows. In both cases I went and tried to watch everything else the actors were in because I loved their portrayals so much.  \n\n\nETA: someone else reminded me that the most riotously fun villain in all of kdrama is the one in **Psychopath Diary.** I actually liked the villain more than all the main characters.",

Both main characters are seemingly good people that end up doing bad things. The drama sometimes makes you feel like their way was the only option. Especially with Weak Class Hero, some of that felt justified. They both are great depictions of an individual's tolerance and how much someone can take before they reach a breaking point",

                            "comment": "The interesting thing about Weak Hero is that basically that first scene with the villain where he does you know what during the test we were like 'oof he's not a good character is he' because he obviously had that darkness and weakness of mind from the beginning that could easily turn him into a villain, but his whole villain arc while foreshadowed was very 'understandable' even if I kind of thought he was not a good character from the start. I wouldn't say his way was the only option but there were lots of little moments where you could imagine him getting back on the right path if only something minor changed, which was what made his arc so tense because it was a death by a thousand cuts kind of villain arc.   \n\n\nUsually you get villains who are pretty intractably villainous at the start but this was an interesting study of how someone can go from being a bit unstable/selfish/amoral to being like an actual deranged evil person without any 'major' traumatic event that triggers it singlehandedly. And it was really expertly acted too.  \n\n\nIn King of Pigs it was kind of opposite where he was the worst at the beginning of the story and then came close to being redeemed more and more as the story went on, but you saw why those attempts to become a better person just weren't enough.",

For example Moonjo from Strangers from Hell, Inwoo from Psychopath Diary, some killers from Voice, or the Killer from V.I.P.!&lt; sometimes they also have some juicy savior or god complex added.\n\nbut i also really like it when it's a combination of the two types &gt;!like for example the Killer in Nobody Knows, the antagonist of Big Mouth, Rang from tale of the nine tailed, one killer from Blind, also the killer from Mouse for a while!&lt;\n\nBut honestly any antagonist that brings something interesting to the table will become a favorite of mine.",

I enjoyed his villainous acting with a subtle comedic undertone in **happiness** (the trashy doctor).\n\nI had the biggest moral dilemma for the villain &gt;!shin hye sun's husband!&lt; in **oh my ghost**.\n\nThe villain of a serial murder case played by &gt;!Lee sang yeob!&lt; in **signal** tugged my heart at some point in the episode. His backstory was too traumatic to make me show leniency towards him despite him doing many horrible things.\n\n&gt;!shin sung rok's wife!&lt; in **Kairos** had me in a rollercoaster ride with &gt;!her!&lt;. I had never been deceived to this extent by a villain from kdramaland in all these years of drama watching. I even wrote essays trying to empathize &gt;!her as a fellow woman only to realize later that she is only a greedy, selfish psycho. I felt a little bad for her at the end though when she realized ahn bo young truly loved her!&lt;\n\nPerhaps because it was one of my earlier kdramas, the villain in **Hyde, jekyll and me** wasn't predictable until they started throwing hints. He is similar to the one in **crash course in romance**, I liked him at the beginning, hated him after the reveal, felt a little bad for him after learning his backstory. \n\nThere are many as I have a soft spot for villains with a sad past but these are the ones that I can remember now. \n\nOh I hate the villains who are purely evil for the sake of being a villain. Example **Dali and the cocky prince**. I fast forwarded through most of his scenes.",

I actually started to suspect the Kairos villain early-ish on (just a feeling I got from the acting, idk) but the script gave away NOTHING until like more than halfway through the show which was amazing. So cool to have a show actually be so good at only dropping extremely subtle hints instead of giving it all away in eps 1-2 (which I felt happened with Mouse, Vincenzo, and many others that people are naming).",

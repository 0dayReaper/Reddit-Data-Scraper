Which honestly makes him feel like one of those old people who grew up in different times and refuses to accept that things have changed in the past 20 years.\n\nAnd she on the other hand is so naive and eager to show that she is hardworking. Which I can understand, because she's grateful and wants to show that she was worth hiring.\n\nI don't think I would've minded any of the things he did for her if it was in a boss-being-kind-to-his-new-employee kind of thing. But he just looks so smitten with her at times and it's... really not my cup of tea.",

The crying out in the bus is probably acceptance of the situation? \n\nHaving built her career around her love life, and to find out that it was actually quite shallow and she had been ignoring flags. The reality check must be so painful. \n\nHope this week\u2019s episode going to be good. I get that quite a few dropped the series after the first 4 episodes and the viewership is less than 1%. I will still be following this one, the side characters are not annoying. None of them were some afterthought. \n\nAnd I think the chicken king is going to be around through the series.",

At first I thought spending another episode on Bora's feelings for Joohwan was too much, but then I realised that's the point; episode 5 was about &gt;!Bora being irrational, clinging to a worthless relationship with a man who's moved on and never matched the depth of her feelings in the first place, worrying the people around her, wallowing in her misery\u2014and still being worthy of love and compassion in that state.!&lt; The takeaway was that sometimes the end of a relationship can hit us harder than it 'should,' but that pain is still valid. I loved the messages she got from other people who've been dumped and hope/expect they'll play a role in the book she decides to write eventually.\n\nThat said, I was VERY happy that &gt;!Bora and the plot finally decided to move on in episode 6.!&lt; I liked the lighter tone and the new story arcs. The &gt;!scam sequence!&lt; was well directed; I didn't immediately realise what was going on, which showed &gt;!how hard it is to avoid falling victim to these scams and made Bora's point that the victim is not to blame.!&lt;\n\nLastly, I really liked the main couple's scenes this week. There's finally some relationship development happening between them and it has a nice subtle zing to it. To quote myself from a reply I made to another comment,\n\n&gt;That &gt;!he lent her money without a second thought!&lt; and only realised it doesn't make sense for him to do that when she pointed it out is evidence of his slowly changing feelings in this week's episodes, though.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don't think he likes her consciously yet, but he got angry at her in the police station's parking lot because she made him aware of the fact he worries about her more than he should be worrying about a casual acquaintance. And she got frustrated with him because she was also forced to notice that he's really kind to her and it made her uncomfortable.\n\nThere were a couple of scenes earlier, like their conversation at the fried chicken place, that also showed subtly that SH is starting to notice BR a little. It's still subconscious and he's not even thinking of acting on it, but that's how I like it. Yay for a well-done romance that takes its time to build up emotion!\n\nBora's \"put trash-talking me on pause\" entrance in the final seconds was funny and I'm looking forward to the chaos next week.",

I have seen a lot of comments around about this show saying that it dragged out the breakup too long but I actually think the length and pathetic nature of her refusing to let go of the relationship is key for both character and relationship development reasons, and will probably form the backbone of her personal and professional development for the rest of the show. I had a feeling that 'being unable to take her own advice in her own relationship' was going to be her big flaw in ep 1 and it is now clear this is the case.  \n\n\nI have seen people go through breakups like this (or worse - sometimes spending years acting this pathetic about relationships that only lasted a few weeks or months) and I like that they showed this side of breakups rather than the extremely calm and dignified way main characters normally handle them in shows.   \n\n\nI also really liked how they subtly introduced the &gt;!phishing scam lol!&lt;.

So her next book will be about her journey through a breakup. It makes sense to draw it out instead of having her quickly and gracefully get over a 5 year relationship like every perfect female lead does in other dramas.",

Breakups are really hard and I have seen many smart, accomplished men and women do ridiculous things in the face of it including the begging and pleading. It is all a bit much, sure, but it happens. For Deborah, this was even more difficult because he cheated AND her entire identity was tied to the this relationship. Not saying that is a good thing but that\u2019s life. People make mistakes, everybody copes differently in their own way. But eventually, most people move on. They find their way. \n\nI am also enjoying how the ML and FL are getting to know each other. It is natural, and not forced. It is also slow and hence, the pay off will be even better. Love a good slow burn. I like that, while they have good chemistry and maybe trust each other instinctively, they still treat each other as an acquaintance, as it should be at this stage.\n\nBetter to have them take time than have them some forced contrived plot towards the end of the show.\n\nI am also enjoying the side characters and all their stories. The married couple especially. \n\nBeautifully acted and produced.",

Great to see that side of her acting dynamic. \n\nThe army guy is kinda funky, borderline stalker-ish? but not quite. Dude got out the army, the FL\u2019s best friend even said he thinks everything is beautiful as he just got out. \n\nSo far he\u2019s not doing dark stuff like following her at night, or secretly taking photos and posting them on his wall. That\u2019s my tipping point with him and he hasn\u2019t crossed that yet. So it\u2019s really not fair to him with how everyone here is over killing him like that. He just seems like an over the top happy go lucky person that\u2019s hopelessly smitten by the FL\u2019s sister. \n\nAlso about the intern that some of y\u2019all are butchering lol I don\u2019t think the intern is weird.

                    "comment": "I like both the sister's simp and the intern. The problem with the simp isn't his actual characterisation for me but rather the fact there are no guys like that in reality; if they're getting a job near the bus stop their crush gets off at it's because they're creepy stalkers, not because they're obtuse little balls of sunshine that just got out of the army and think women are the greatest thing in the universe. But I have no issue with him in the context of the story yet.\n\nThe intern is one of my favourite characters. She's clearly very socially awkward and doesn't seem to have an easy life. She's like a more realistic take on the 'poor beautiful heroine who's relentlessly positive and hardworking despite her tragic backstory, can't tie her own shoes or carry her own umbrella, and has handsome CEOs fighting over the privilege to solve her problems for her' archetype. The scene where she insisted on refilling the water cooler was good. Through perseverance and determination she only succeeded in embarrassing herself, and people's concern and offers of help were more of a burden than the blessing they are treated as in old-school dramas about this kind of plucky working-class character. The scene where the CEO bought her an outfit was another sendup of an old kdrama clich\u00e9. Instead of buying out a fashion boutique for her while calling her ugly like Hyun Bin might have done in Secret Garden, he got her a cheap dress of her choosing, but the dress was weird because Uri is weird, and the fact he bought her clothes in the first place was the weirdest thing about the whole weird situation, as Soohyuk clearly wanted to say.\n\nThe way the people around Uri react to her is pretty realistic; they view her as the CEO's geeky nepo hire who doesn't know how the office works and is almost young enough to be his daughter, and when she needs help and understanding it's a drain on their already stretched resources. Older dramas would have made the entire universe revolve around a helpless and naive pretty girl like her, but that's not how the real world works, sadly.\n\nAll that being said... I gotta say Uri herself is really likeable. I'm rooting for her, maybe precisely because the world of the drama is indifferent to her struggles. I definitely think she's too good for the CEO, but if she likes him so much, I guess she can have him.",

There are guys out there that are oddballs of sunshine with good intentions. However the chances meeting them are slimmer than meeting your regular everyday guy or even if ladies do run across one, the guy is misconstrued just like how his character is currently here in the comments. Lol. Also, in some way I feel like a good portion of ladies would rather deal with the everyday guy because the oddball of sunshine is so different in understanding, it\u2019s just easier to just deal with the former. There\u2019s also the case that sometimes ladies are just simply not looking their way. \n\nUri is very likeable. You\u2019re so right about older kdramas making a whole storyline revolving around that kind of character. I\u2019m rooting for her too. I think she\u2019s too good for the CEO too but they could work though. A random thought popped in my head as I\u2019m typing this right now about how a pairing up of Uri and army guy could work too \ud83d\ude1d both two oddballs with Uri for sure, and the guy (so far) having good intentions",

I literally had someone tell me the other day that they saw a few oppas in their life before they got married but they were \u201cpoor\u201d. \n\nIt also depends on the phase in the life, certain times depending on the age an oppa isn\u2019t even looked for, but you shook his hand, said hello then quickly slid right past him. \n\nHe\u2019s not insanely unrealistic, just not easy to find. Not a lot have the real patience to go to the lengths for that. That\u2019s why ppl \u201csettle\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s many many factors why connections don\u2019t meet.

In reality a man of his age and life experience (literally being in the army for 2 years etc) would know that orbiting a girl who has shown zero interest in him in this kind of overly forward, i-know-where-you-live way would be perceived as scary and would probably try to find another way to get close to her than literally getting a job in her neighbourhood. It's not about 'love' (they don't know each other) or even 'patience' but about doing things that a grown adult would realistically know would scare the crap out of a real person.",

I'm not a fan of the kdramas where the FL is constantly crying or the only character that falls apart all the time but I get this, she was/is  an influencer, her whole life revolved around social media and relationships. Every moment of her relationship was put up on social media for the world to see and like. She was so immersed in her fictional perfect world so much that was willing to put up with cheating and being treated like crap by her loser boyfriend who was only using her as trophy, she could she other people's issues in relationships but she couldnt see her own because she didnt want to. When the so call perfect relationship ended, so did her who \"perfect life\". Her world fell apart. I've heard of so many influencers committing suicide when bad things happen to them that they can't handle. This is real life stuff and even though im thankful that my life is not on social media. I can understand her utter inability to be able to deal with this situation she is in.\n\nEdit: the only difference is that in real life there isn't always a hot stranger wanting to hug you and help you through the break up \ud83e\udd23",

Telling someone on the radio 'GIRL, just dump him and humiliate his cheating a\\*\\*' is one thing and actually seeing your 4-5yr relationship go up in flames when you thought you were about to get the perfect life of your dreams and staying calm and being a girlboss about it is entirely another.",

To add to that her entire ego, self esteem, and dream for her future relied upon having this 'perfect relationship' and marriage which her whole self-image was tied up in. She also clearly had problems dealing with the pain and humiliation emotionally, and even highly intelligent people will in fact frequently nuke entire aspects of their lives and reputations because they are having an emotional overreaction to something.  \n\n\nI have seen this so often IRL with breakups and none of the people I know who did things like this had careers as celebrity dating coaches, I'm really struggling to understand why so many commenters act like this is implausible.",

Her meltdown made a lot of sense to me. It may have felt that all she worked for plus the \"future\" she was looking f9rward to came crashing down on her. \n\nAnd seeing a close friend in law school having meltdown almost the same way as Bora did made it so realistic. Friend was top of the class, was preparing for the bar exams when she found out her fianc\u00e9 cheated on her with a resident. She flew home the day before the bar exams and made a scene in the hospital where her fianc\u00e9 is doing fellowship. She almost missed the bar the next day, took the exam barely sober and eventually failed the bar. It took her over a year to heal and have the courage to take the bar exams again. Every person just copes differently.",

The other show had a female lead with PTSD and there were similar comments saying 'why is she still like that, it's not such a big deal, she should have gotten over it earlier.'   \n\n\nMy theory is that either many of the users commenting this are on the younger end and have not seen as many long term relationships break up in their personal circles/not had to grieve too many relatives etc, or just that some people who start watching a 'drama' expect the characters to act like more perfect, admirable, etc. versions of real human beings. I have noticed people will complain about shows where leads are perceived as doing the 'wrong thing', not being 'strong' enough etc. and maybe this just reflects an attitude where some viewers want lead characters to be aspirational rather than realistic.",

Even though she and the ML strongly disliked each other when he carried her, him 'saving her' made her feelings toward him far more positive as though going through the ritual of the socially sanctioned romantic thing actually 'materialized' positive feelings toward each other.  \n\n\nMfEO had really quick and snappy pacing which was imo one of its strengths but since the character's relationship depended upon them meeting each other after their respective traumas and trying to 'figure out' what was wrong with the other person, we only got (brief) exposition of their trauma as viewers later on in the show, in order to keep us guessing along with the leads. Here I think the focus is more about the kind of camaraderie that can develop through 'trauma bonding' or going through a shared unpleasant or traumatizing experience, and how feeling that kind of caring and empathy toward a person can soften your feelings toward them overall and transform into real closeness. MfEO was barely longer than 6 hours total and this show is only around a third done so I don't know if it will end up less moving, more moving or the same amount moving since we haven't gone through everything with the characters yet, but I think it's too early to tell.",

Basically every single romcom in the last 2-3 years has been unfinishable for me unless they were more straight-up comedy shows like Gaus Electronics with a small amount of romance sprinkled in so I'm really excited that there is one I'm pretty sure I can and will watch past ep 8.  \n\n\nThe writer's previous show had one of the best drama couples I've ever seen and actually made me cry (which I basically never do in any drama) multiple times even though it was a short series less than half the length of a standard kdrama. This one might seem like a little 'much' because there is more exposition but I have real faith in this team and so far everything has seemed very realistic, well-crafted and easy to empathize with when it comes to the main characters (some of the side characters, not quite so much).   \n\n\nI do think the extreme cringe moments can be unpleasant but I think it helps with the 'empathy' part of watching the show. If you're actively cringing in sympathy with the characters that means you on some level identify with or feel for them already, and the payoff will be greater when they pull themselves back out of the rut.  \n\n\nI actually see zero similarities with Love In Contract though, what have people been saying to compare them?",

Yes, I did not like *the way* that FL destroyed her own career (and truthfully skipped the whole scene from extreme secondhand cringe), but I think it's important to show her hitting rock bottom for her to grow. I imagine that she'll get a book deal with ML, except it'll be something realistic and maybe her explaining why all of her previous dating advice was wrong.\n\n4 episodes is a long time to set up a drama but it's been a decent ride so far. The scene at the garbage truck from episode 3 is still one of my all time favorites from any k-drama- it went on for a solid minute or 2 longer than I thought it would and it was by far the most engaging funny-while-giving-feels I've watched in a while.",

Also, the show didn't get us invested in the relationship at all so we as an audience dont giver a shit they broke up. We had like two episodes of them together and both times it was clear he was not committed at all to their relationship. They didn't do the work for me to want to watch the female lead be pathetic for 3 episodes straight. If you want to pull that then maybe portray the relationship better. That being said, I won't drop it because I do like the female lead actress and she is really good so I have hopes and it finally seems like we are coming off this pathetic arc. If it lasted one more episode I would have dropped it as the character would be too annoying. Also if the worst thing in your life was a break up with a guy who was clearly not really committed to you at all then I would say you have had a good life. Hell, her career going down the tank would have been a way better reason for her to spiral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, please dont let the boss guy and the young worker woman get into a relatiionship. They do not have any romantic chemistry. They seem more like father daughter or mentor type relationship. The phone phishing thing was funny cause you best believe if someone asks me to send close to 40 thousand dollars I gonna need to at least hear that personally. Also like your phone being cracked interrupts calling but not messaging? How does that even make sense? The younger sister and the ML were pretty dumb falling for that shit. \n\nAh Also the army guy is a weirdo.",

It is probably interesting mostly to people who have either experienced this level of grief/loss, or have been in the position of caring for someone who has. It's not just a breakup though, it's her whole life and life plan collapsing in front of her eyes along with her entire image of herself as a successful, savvy, together person.   \n\n\nI keep seeing complaints that the show didn't get us invested in the relationship before the breakup and I think this criticism is missing the point. There is no reason to believe the relationship was worth being this torn up over, but what Bo Ra is grieving isn't A Really Great Guy, it's (as I said above) her whole self image, plans for her perfect life, self-narrative, etc. going down the drain plus the massive BETRAYAL of someone you thought was about to propose to you actually cheating with someone you knew well and thought was their literal cousin. This means he's been lying to her for a very long time and she was too trusting and loving to ever doubt him, while being a famous relationship guru. It isn't just the loss of the relationship, it's the betrayal, and the HUMILIATION of the whole situation that sends her over the edge.  \n\n\nThe point is not for viewers to care about the past relationship, the point of all this is for the viewers to understand what kind of person the main characters are, what they value/prioritize, how they deal with grief and loss, etc. I think if you don't 'care' or aren't willing to try to empathize with the main characters then the show is just not for you, because clearly for a lot of people this is hitting all the right notes and is successfully pulling them in. It seems like you are just not into character-centered stories and that's an OK preference to have. The focus here is on the character, not the relationship between her and the ex. And the most interesting part will be seeing how she builds herself back up after hitting rock bottom, how this affects the dynamic between the leads, and how her views on her own value as well as love will change in the process of learning her whole life was a lie.",

But tbh I'm kinda tired of seeing the same thing i know breakup is hard and moving on is not easy but still she's making me frustrated. I was so excited for the new episode but i didn't really like it. But I'll still wait for the new episode because of yoo-in-a and maybe they'll get a character development. I liked her  in the previous episodes and hated the ml now i don't know where i stand",

The entire sequence of her going to his house and begging him to get together again... !&lt;I was cringing and hollering at the screen, hoping she'd just leave. Yeah, yeah, I know, realistic depiction of breakups and all that but it's getting a bit much imo. especially since there are apparently only 14 eps, so we need time for the main romance to begin already.\n\nlook, I wasn't a big fan of FL's sister but the way she keeps giving former army dude the cold shoulder is actually very valid. like, dude, the girl is uninterested - she's made it clear several times - and you keep saying \"it's destiny\" like that makes it okay. sis should straight up block him.",

Reminds me of the point u/festerfaster made last week. ETA: it's a drop for me. I actually think this show is kind of misogynistic.

Like none of that was necessary? She could have  chosen to write the book to rehabilitate her professional reputation, no bottoming out required. I mean the ML gets to have a breakup and write a book without losing everything first.!&lt;",

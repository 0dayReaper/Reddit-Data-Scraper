During the day, Jo Yeo Hwa lives a quiet and modest life as a virtuous woman who cannot see the world outside the fence, but at night she jumps over the fence and goes out into the world to take care of those in need without anyone knowing.",

I think they are likely easier to film in summer due to the costumes so it always seems like more of them come out in the warmer months.",

There are not that many sageuks with snow/bare trees etc. which I assume is because they're typically not wearing coats, shoes appropriate for snow/wet etc. although there are some that are filmed during winter and the scenes can be quite beautiful.  \n\n\nBut I would assume the wet/lack of additional insulating layers could be pretty tough for certain scenes, I could be wrong but it never seems like there are that many filmed during winter.",

That's the beauty of modern thermal layers. Han Ga-In was particularly vocal about freezing to death during the filming of The Moon Embracing the Sun ten years ago since she was poor/cast off for most of the drama.\n\nApart from clearly seeing their breath, I always look at the actors' hands and ears as they turn bright red when it's really cold.",

It was the middle of the summer like July but it was moderately chilly (like probably 15-18 degrees C) and cloudy and the actors kept doing a scene in their period clothing where the girl walked into the ocean in a full victorian ankle length dress and the guy went in in a suit and shoes and carried her out of the water. They did this like probably 30+ times and had to sit there in sopping wet heavy clothing (that got blowdried a bit so it didn't look wet in the next take) and then were given full length massive down parkas and mittens and stuff while they waited to do it again. There were no heated buildings, bathrooms or anything nearby.   \n\n\nI watched the movie when it came out and the scene was like 15 seconds long lol I really felt for actors at that moment.  \n\n\nI have also been an extra in a movie with similar extreme temp situations and man it was so rough, idk how actors do it day after day.",

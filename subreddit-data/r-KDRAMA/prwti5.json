All things, no matter how good, have to come to an end \u2014 at the right *time*. They rightly realised that although the show never underperformed at any point, it's best for the sake of the story and the characters to not stretch it out beyond a point. \n\nKudos to them for giving us such flawless, excellently made seasons.",

            "comment": "Hospital Playlist has taught me a lot about the wonders of medical advancements, the hard work and dedication of those in the medical field, and the importance of taking good care of your health. You have to live life to the fullest because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, or even in the next minute. Don't forget to take time for friends and family because they're what makes life worth living for.\n\nTo PD Shin Won Ho: If you're reading this, please consider making season 3. With the craziness of the world right now, we all need another dose of hope and positivity which you have the power to bring through the characters of Hospital Playlist. From the friendship and love between the core characters to the touching stories of patients and their families, your knack for storytelling is amazing and I truly hope you'll consider sharing more with us.",

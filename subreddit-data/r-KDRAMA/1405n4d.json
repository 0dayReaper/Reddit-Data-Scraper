I just can't get enough of it and I'm in the car a lot, so this plays over and over. \n\nI'm learning Korean, at least the alphabet and some phrases. So I like to watch the youtube videos of these songs that have the Hangul, the English romanization, and the English translations. This helps to solidify my reading of the Korean letters. Then I sing along, at least with the repeated phrases. \n\nThe other day (while driving a 6 hour drive, after listening to the HP mix twice, I played one of my favorite mixes of \"happy kdrama music that I love.\" Too many to name here, but this includes \"Floating\" from Her Private Life, \"the Image of You\" From Hometown Cha Cha cha, \"Sweeter\" from Angel's Last Mission and over 70 more. It would take over 4 hours to listen to the whole thing.... And it makes me so happy! \n\nAlso the soundtrack from **Our Beloved Summer.**",

            "comment": "I've been liking the soundtrack for *Just Between Lovers*. It's well-constructed and chosen for each moment/mood. \n\nI really liked the songs in *Our Blooming Youth*. I found them poignant and relevant to the story, especially the situation and feelings of the characters. Here are the main 3:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/2URys8E6imQmRIfAlES1p4?si=7f8bd19cb271455d](https://open.spotify.com/track/2URys8E6imQmRIfAlES1p4?si=7f8bd19cb271455d)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/03G8XB2OIrcdtFPFS8Iium?si=f32643229ffe46d6](https://open.spotify.com/track/03G8XB2OIrcdtFPFS8Iium?si=f32643229ffe46d6)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/2Hft5QuUvkQDsLhETHHHmg?si=ac5a302199054879](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Hft5QuUvkQDsLhETHHHmg?si=ac5a302199054879)\n\nI do tend to prefer Korean and Chinese drama songs when they're in the series; they feel quite different on their own - but there are exceptions. (The ones I'm including in this comment are among them). \n\n*My Perfect Stranger* has a theme song, often played at the end, that seems to be by the same person who sang *Angular Stones* for *Bossam: Steal the Fate.* I haven't looked it up yet to check, but I like the style. \n\nI love almost all of the music - songs and instrumental (background) - in *Love Between Fairy and Devil*. It's so good! The background music is available on You Tube, and the songs are readily available on Spotify and You Tube. I do have some favourites, but will just share if anyone's interested, since it is a Chinese series.\n\nI also liked [https://open.spotify.com/track/346MMYSVdjNlyN61rkmOWY?si=18229f4efe494779](https://open.spotify.com/track/346MMYSVdjNlyN61rkmOWY?si=18229f4efe494779) and [https://open.spotify.com/track/3BNSZOeVDkxVfawEaMqj5l?si=42587c85ab6845ce](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BNSZOeVDkxVfawEaMqj5l?si=42587c85ab6845ce) from *Delivery Man.*",

My previous favourite was also sung by Lia - [Blue Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvTHBV0XIIk&amp;ab_channel=StoneMusicEntertainment), Alchemy of Souls: Light and Shadow OST. There is something about her voice that brings out the tragic and sad feelings.",

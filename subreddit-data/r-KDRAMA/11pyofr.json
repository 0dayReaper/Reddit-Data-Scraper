The scenes in outside in the  neighborhoods look like musical or theater stages, or am I seeing things?lol  \nNonetheless, I really enjoy the story and Jang Dong Yoon is always a hit :)",

He just has a really slow and roundabout way of showing it to Doo Hak. At the very least, he learned his lesson and decided to protect his club members while getting immense external pressure. That has to count for something.",

            "comment": "This is a weird one. It feels \"off\" to me.  The sets and styling are more like the 40's  than the 80s. I don't get the appeal of Jang Dong Yoon. No offense to his fans, but I don't find him charismatic. How many times do we have to see Doo Hak singlehandedly beat up 20 men without getting so much as a scratch? And  I just don't care about him and the heroine AT ALL. I think a lot if it is the writing. I'm more emotionally invested in CW and he's a villain in training!  I can already see where this is going with the plot.  CW will date Shin Jung but never win her heart because she loves DH. He'll use his power as a prosecuter and have DH jailed. But then she'll find out that he's the real murderer and be reunited with DH. Or maybe he and Doo Hak will work together to fight for democracy and he'll have a redemption arc but die in the end..  We have seen CW be unselfish. He didn't betray his friends even after being waterboarded and tortured. But then he turns around and is a horrible, cowardly bastard. Either he's the most interesting character or the most inconsistently written one. I think I'll wait until all the episodes are out because it might be better with a binge watch. But so far, I'm having a hard time getting into this drama. Glad others are enjoying it tho!",

She clearly wanted to be with SuHyeok but felt he wasn't giving her what she needed in a relationship for all those years (confirmation of his feelings, defining the relationship) so she opted for security/being provided for instead, with a man she doesn't love (as much).   \n\n\nIn many ways I think this was the 'smarter' choice for her - no woman should wait around for a man who can't confirm his feelings for half a decade - but she shouldn't be betraying her husband-to-be by rushing into a relationship when she's not over her last one either.",

Bo Ra calling her on the two-timing and not having given all the details when she wrote the story asking for advice in the radio program. Su Hyeok not dignifying the \"Did you really love me?\" with an answer. She's telling him she's moving on, he's trying to move on. What's the point? He was probably more aware of her emotional instability than we are. We'll see next week...",

And it took him incidentally overhearing a radio segment that described someone who sounded an awful lot like him and hearing Bora's advice because after 4 years with this woman he somehow couldn't intuit/suss out that she wanted commitment, or even ask her about it.  \n\n\nAs ep 10 made pretty clear, there's nothing admirable or lovable about someone realizing how good they have it in a relationship right at the moment they realize they might lose it (cringe YuJeong/Jinwoo  bar scene) and sunk cost/fear of loss being so much stronger than genuine desire to make your loved one happy is a sign of a failed relationship in and of itself.  \n\n\nI agree that I liked how Bora and Suhyeok responded to Yuri this episode. I had an ex who contacted me with these weird guilt tripping questions to get a rise out of me and I responded the same way SuHyeok did. 'Uh isn't it too late to talk about this? Good luck with your life I'm rooting for you.' At least in this one particular way he's more emotionally intelligent than Bora is lol.",

She was 'winning' (whatever that means in this context) the conversation all the way up till she got impatient and wanted to hear the words from Su Hyeok that he actually loved her. If she had just left it at the point where Su Hyeok asked her if the other guy treated her well, I think all she wanted was to shake him up. But because she probed further and asked if he did actually loved her, im guessing her true purpose was that she had lingering feelings. Remember the scene beforehand where Bora asked Yuri why her plan was so ruthless and whether it was lingering feelings or revenge. So this just proves it was the former. Because if it was only to shake him up and for revenge, the point was well put across up to the point where she stated the man she was gonna marry could provide everything that Su Hyeok couldnt, also that pained expression on Su Hyeok's face should have been the clincher. But alas as she said earlier with Bora, dhe wanted to check if she still had lingering feelings, and she did have them and thats why she probed further and was hurt when what she expected to hear from him never materialised and ended up leaving in tears. Tbh this scene was just masterfully written and well acted out. I loved it so much.",

In fact Bora was kind of doing this in a way as well, and the bff is also sitting around waiting for something to improve in her marriage (even though she already got the 'commitment'), etc.  \n\n\nI think this show is doing a good job of showing what people actually act like in relationships in real life rather than the typical idealized/fantasy relationships of most kdrama and I personally really enjoy it, but that means that many of the characters' actions are frustrating. Yuri was even told by Bora in ep. 1 that she should stop waiting around being a forevergirlfriend and that was some of the best advice Bora ever gave in this show (which was the catalyst for both the breakup and Su-Hyeok buying the jewelry wanting to commit).   \n\n\nBut yeah after getting out of a relationship where you were waiting around and hurting for years and years and getting into one with someone who wants to commit I think it's realistic to look back and want the other person to realize they messed up and wasted years of your life, so the pettiness is kind of understandable even though it's her fault too.",

She wants to maintain the image of them being happy and perfect (which other people all seem to have) and would be embarrassed to admit that they're not, especially since she gets some social clout from being the one friend in her group who is 'happily married' and has her life together.  \n\n\nBut also, I think she loves him a lot and thinks that if she's patient and tries to communicate her needs to him without hurting his feelings, he will 'get' it sooner or later, they're going through a phase etc. but she still thinks it's not as fundamentally broken a relationship as it obviously is.   \n\n\nI actually find this very true-to-life because I had some friends like this who got into long-term cohabitating relationships with guys other people thought were kind of scrubs in their early/mid 20s and then were that one 'coupled up' friend while the rest of the group was still dating around. They were obviously unhappy and it later turned out that the scrub of a guy wasn't even remotely pulling his weight or particularly into my friend(s) but they were the kind of girls who got a big self esteem boost from being 'in a relationship' and wanted to put the work in to make the relationship good, but they just couldn't no matter how hard they tried. These relationships then usually ended up breaking up late 20s/early 30s with seemingly no warning.",

Seeing Su Hyeok hurt by Bora and being sulky almost made up for all the misunderstandings. \n\nBut man oh man do they all need therapy! Especially Yu Jeong and Bora. What\u2019s interesting about Yu Jeong\u2019s character is that typically when we\u2019re given messy FLs, the best friend is always the balanced one gently pushing in the right direction, but here they\u2019re presenting us with a hot mess twinning combo and as a viewer I think that\u2019s throwing us off a bit. In reality sometimes you have very well meaning friends who are equally if not more immature than you! \n\nWhat was also interesting is that they\u2019ve given Su Hyeok character growth in the most subtle manner. For him to call her out for being so caught up in her own feelings to not even stop to consider others seems like a bit of a departure from his old self who wouldn\u2019t really quite vocalize his feelings (good or bad ones). I thought this was great because it really showcased how hurt he was. I do appreciate that they\u2019re likely going to show us another perspective of dealing with break-ups\u2026.getting busy with work and other people\u2019s shenanigans so you think you\u2019ve processed your feelings but you actually haven\u2019t. I hope this set-up is to give Bora a chance to be more mature and give him the support he provided her unabashedly. \n\nAlso, that Auschwitz reference had no business being there.",

                    "comment": "Agree w/ almost everything in this comment (yes to the throwaway line that Bora should remember wink wink) but especially the part about the dynamic between the friends. I actually think this is a really cool aspect of the show, irl it's so common for people to be friends with 'similar' people and honestly often for those people to then egg each other on with their questionable decisions and habits. It's cool that this show doesn't have any one person who is super together and spitting constant nuggets of wisdom, and smart ideas/comments come from flawed characters (one example is the publishing house CEO, hot mess of a person that he is, telling ML that 'the polite thing to do after a breakup is to (pretend to) get over the other person quickly.'   \n\n\nI also thought YuJeong trying to insert herself with the 'mistake' convo in the cafe was poking fun at a common kdrama trope where no one every talks about anything so things go unspoken for way too long. Viewers often say 'I wish characters would just TALK to each other/tell people stuff so there are no misunderstandings!' yet we had a running theme in this episode of Yujeong running her mouth to both of them at regular intervals trying to help and smooth over communication between them but it just makes things worse and worse and worse. However, in the past her meddling HAS been helpful (inviting SuHyeok to the housewarming for e.g.) so it's not always equally troublesome.  \n\n\nWe also see Bora talking a lot about how she wish she had waited/left certain things unspoken because her impatience with running her mouth keeps embarrassing her and getting her into trouble, but it has also led to some deepening of relationships as well while SuHyeok's relationship was ruined by his reticence. Both approaches have caused AND resolved misunderstandings at times, but with YuJeong the problem is she projects herself on Bora too much and assumes too much about what Bora is really thinking or feeling, partly because her own life is boring and she probably finds it exciting to get involved in other people's problems.  \n\n\nSome people don't like that it has taken SuHyeok so long to start working through his feelings but I think you hit the nail on the head - he didn't humiliate himself like Bora did because he is the kind to keep things bottled up and distract himself but this ultimately blows up on you sooner or later when something causes the feelings to come to the surface. For him it will probably be a combo of the wedding invite and the (seeming) rejection/insensitivity by Bora that pushes him over the edge. In this he is actually similar to YuJeong despite having an opposite 'external' personality - she also gets overly involved in other people's problems as a way of avoiding dealing with her own. They feel like sort of similar characters to me in a weird way.",

Also - they confirmed that she was already seeing the other guy, right? That's why it's not that surprising she is getting married so soon since she said she was torn between the two of them.!&lt;",

In fact, he\u2019s quite expressive. Is this a new conscious effort or was he always like this and ex-gf was overreacting?",

The first 10 min were toe curling and oh so flirty and sweet, but for all it\u2019s fluffy moments this show is really showcasing the complexity of modern relationships quite well. Even Bo Ra\u2019s growth is gradual and organic, and yeah she now gets a chance to return the favour to Su Hyeok but it\u2019s going to come from such a good place and not necessarily just because she\u2019s developing romantic feelings from him. \n\nI love when a show can show me a strong friendship between its romantic leads as the foundation because I feel like that always adds gravity to the relationship and keeps away vague  responses like \u201cbecause\u201d when one eventually  asks why the other loves them. \n\nI also loved that they showed us that Bo Ra\u2019s advice or columns weren\u2019t always frivolous or superficial. That column of hers that she read was such great advice from her past self. I was like yeah you go girl\u2026gotta nip overthinking in the bud!\n\nAlso, Yu Ri has turned out to be far more manipulative than I ever expected. With Ju Wan it was a case of didn\u2019t know how to communicate that he wasn\u2019t in love anymore and with her it\u2019s a case of being horribly selfish. Unless there\u2019s more layers to Ju Wan\u2019s shittiness, I am a little disappointed that yet again the female ex is portrayed as the worse one but honestly whatevs. Good riddance to both of them!\n\nKudos to Bo Ra &gt;!for sitting quietly in the car and not reacting knowing everything she knows about Yu Ri. If I were her and it was my friend this person was emotionally harassing, I\u2019d have yanked the phone and been like girl, bye!&lt;. Either way the end and promo give me a lot of hope. \n\nThis show has had a good run of episodes so far. I arrived late but I\u2019m really really enjoying it!",

I was just making an observation about how with this past episode the show sort of amped up the portrayal of Yuri\u2019s crappiness compared to how they showcased Ju Wan. With the latter they only ever really show him being externally pathetic during the &gt;!garbage scene!&lt; but for the most part it\u2019s very run of the mill, I got bored, fell out of love and lied and cheated with someone younger bit so that even when Bo Ra went back to &gt;!break up with him a second time!&lt; it was a much more dignified conversation (obviously in large part to Bo Ra) VS with Yuri, I don\u2019t know, the portrayal of her crappiness being tinged with hysterics just made me feel like as always they show the female ex to be more \u201ctoxic\u201d, when in reality like you said they both behaved equally badly/cruelly. \n\nThat aside what I really like about the show so far is that everyone is shown to have faults and shortcomings that led to their failing relationships. \n\nNow all we have to do is wait a whole 6 days to enjoy one the most beloved tropes of KDrama land\u2026&gt;!fake boyfriend time!&lt;! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0d",

I love friends-to-lovers shows and this is exactly why, it doesn't feel as shallow as the typical 'we met yesterday and went through nothing together but we're fated!!' romcom trajectory, and this one is really well-done because they're not actually pressing each other or trying to fast track the relationship in any way, they just genuinely care for one another. What a truly sweet and wholesome relationship.  \n\n\nAlso I keep telling people that her advice was never (for the most part) bad at all, she was just bad at listening to herself! Watching this show and going through a Situation with a friend who can't get over a toxic/abusive ex I keep thinking about Dua Lipa's The Rules video and the message of the video which is basically that women have to support each other by constantly repeating very simple common-sense advice that we all know to be true but don't want to listen to when heartbroken, and then pay it forward by supporting friends in a similar situation. In this show you see that Bora doesn't have to be great at relationships herself to give simple common-sense advice, but she's bad at taking it when she's feeling emotional, and the same advice also applies to SuHyeok (they're helping each other by keeping each other honest and helping each other save face because her own friends and family aren't helping). What she said to Yuri about relationships being petty in the studio came back to bite her, but the advice in her books was pretty solid. It's internalizing these things we all know that is hard.  \n\n\nI gotta admit I'm a little baffled by people calling Yuri a straight villain while they are understanding of Ju-wan though. Ju-wan still seems way more villainous to me. He pulled a long-game deception on her by lying for years that the younger girl he liked was his family member, and was cheating with her for god knows how long while actively planning on proposing to Bora (he even bought her a ring lol iirc) so he was planning on two-timing her forever for social status and clout while refusing to admit he didn't love her. Yes she might have been overbearing and suffocating but he made zero attempt to understand her, ultimately telling her that she only liked him for his social status and money when she obviously didn't just like him for those reasons. Then he was pretty remorseless about cheating.  \n\n\nUnless there is way more to the Yuri story people are somehow psychically picking up on (it certainly isn't shown in the script), she waited around for the man she loved for years while he refused to call her his girlfriend or define the relationship in any way, telling her he would never get married and 'jokingly' encouraging her to go out on dates. Then she eventually started meeting a guy who wanted to be her actual boyfriend/husband and waited around a bit longer, but ultimately gave up on the guy who wouldn't commit and chose the 'husband material' guy instead since he gave her a sense of security.   \n\n\nI get that what she's doing now is manipulative but it's probably coming from her deep regret/inability to get over SuHyeok whereas JuWon has given no signs of actually loving or respecting Bora and was deliberately manipulating her for presumably a long time. So I don't think the female second lead is being portrayed as 'worse' here, though it remains to be seen what else will be revealed in the last 4 episodes.  \n\n\nYeah kudos to Bora and she's been really respectful of SuHyeok's boundaries so far despite being a flaming hot mess, I think it's the start of a healthy relationship (already a healthy friendship) where she's not putting her feelings before his and wants to see him be OK and have no hangups before she makes a real move.",

In ep3 when JinWoo and Juhwan have the convo (that YuJeong and Bora overhear) he says 'if we make up this time I'd have to marry her' and JinWoo says 'yeah you already bought a ring.' Then Juhwan says 'yes, I was going to marry her.' and then even says 'I do get butterflies when I think of marrying her.' Then he goes on to talk about how now that Bora knows he cheated he would be a 'prisoner of war' and she would always hold it against him that he cheated and hold him to good behaviour which makes him shudder. So he 100% was with the side piece for god knows how long (in the same convo when JinWoo asks him how long he's been sleeping with the other girl he refuses to answer) but was still about to ask Bora to marry him ANYWAY.   \n\n\nI'm not sure how this could make him and Yuri alike, at all. Once she was sure she wanted the security of marriage she dumped SuHyeok up front and right away and told him she was going to marry a guy who wanted her instead.  \n\n\nI guess I think people think Yuri is worse because 1. people have said so in the thread explicitly and 2. lots of people are calling her the 'real villain of the show finally' implying there was no villain before. But I agree Juhwan is probably going to get his next week as well and maybe we can all hate him again! I hope!",

Whereas, Juhwan was steadfast in his choice, and didn't regret the decision he made. Juhwan never planned to get back together with Bora after discussing his betrayal, whereas Yuri seems to want to mend things with Suhyeok after seeing him begin to move on.",

I didn't really blame her for 'not communicating well' either since I understand you want the commitment to feel organic and come from a place of really wanting to commit. HOWEVER.  \n\n\nA few days/weeks before you're getting married maybe ISN'T the time to dredge it back up for your fiance's sake if not for anyone else's. Okay she took the dignified way out and ended it without begging and pleading for closure, but begging and pleading for closure months later when you're about to get married is even more pathetic and shadier. Of all the things other people say are 'not at all relatable' in this show I basically came up with reasons why I can relate to most of them, but I simply can't personally relate to the meme of choosing to rush into a marriage when you're still hung up over someone else and trying to rope them back into your orbit. Gross AND embarrassing.",

I was surprised that she was handing out wedding invitations so soon but this whole time &gt;!she was actually cheating on Suhyuk??!&lt; Then she wants to make ML feel miserable and regretful at her wedding? I'm glad Bora told her what she did. But the nerve of Yuri to call Suhyuk after all that and ask him to come, URGH. And her poor fianc\u00e9...\n\nAnyways, I'm glad that Suhyuk and Bora have talked things out and have become friendly again. I actually quite like the pace that the two of them are taking in this relationship. Honestly would have felt too sudden if they suddenly confessed and started dating here (plus the timing of the ex drama on both sides). \n\nNot too sure how to feel about the turn of events for Yujung and her husband... We finally see some feelings from him but I still need to see them properly communicate going forward.\n\nThe CEO is soooo clueless, he's getting on my nerves. Both with the intern and with his ex-wife as we've seen in episode 10.",

It seems like she wanted the relationship to be defined but he refused to commit and she started seeing someone else while waiting around for him to commit to her.  \n\n\nShe wants to make SuHyeok regretful and miserable because he's the guy she actually loved/wanted to be with more but the other guy was promising security/stability and marriage so she opted for that over eternal undefined 'some' relationship. Somewhat understandable as a choice but she should have been honest with both of them and honestly I feel like the future husband is probably more of a victim here since I doubt he knows about SuHyeok at all.  \n\n\nAgree eon the timing/trajectory of the main leads' relationship, it's really cute and I'm glad they're not rushing things.   \n\n\nI don't think YuJeong's husband has redeemed himself at all in this ep. The only 'feelings' we see from him are possessiveness/panic at the idea of losing the comfy situation he has, which he has done exactly zero to nurture or maintain as far as we are aware. This show of jealousy and possessiveness seems to have comforted YuJeong but I'm not sure that's a good thing - it's basically meaningless. No one wants to lose what they have but that doesn't mean they will actually work hard to keep it.  \n\n\nI kindasorta relate to the CEO re: the ex-wife because I understand the feeling of being so paralyzed in communication that you both just uncritically accept what the other person says. Especially if he thought she couldn't stand his family anymore. But his actions with the intern are SO MINDBLOWINGLY STUPID OMG I need someone to notice and put a stop to this since he obviously won't.",

                            "comment": "I agree with most of this except that I do think she cheated. The relationship was defined and it was exclusive, just not in the way she wanted. (i.e. he told her not to go out with other men and asked her to move in with him). \n\nNow was Su Hyeok a great boyfriend to Yuri? No. He was clueless and stupid. In his head, he had this chill girlfriend who didn't need constant reassurances like other 'needy' women did except she IS that needy but she didn't want to be honest about it as she wanted to appear to be the cool girlfriend. \n\nShe started comparing her relationship with her other people and when she found it lacking, did not fix things but instead started going out with another man. No one proposes right after starting a new relationship so this tells me Yuri has been going out and dating her fianc\u00e9 well before she broke up with Su Hyeok. So she actually did cheat.\n\nYuri's case is extremely sad because she did actually have the relationship she wanted with Su Hyeok but she couldn't see it just because he didn't love her the way she wanted and because she didn't have the courage to put her foot down in the beginning and advocate for her own needs, he didn't have a chance to learn how to make her happy but instead will learn it only in time for his next woman (Deborah). Deborah called him out right away without a fuss when he left her on read and that's sort of the thing Yuri should have done.\n\nYu Jeong on the other hand, does know and articulates what she wants but her husband takes her for granted and makes her do all the heavy lifting in their relationship. I wasn't impressed by his show of jealousy at all and good for Yu Jeong for standing her ground and not sleeping with him when he wanted it. I also am not impressed with him for not calling out Ju Hwan on his cheating. Deborah might have gone off the deep end but let's not forget who is the actual villain here and what he did to push her over the edge.\n\nOn another note, I do hope they are just pulling our leg with the CEO and that the intern is just cluelessly nice because she's grateful to him for giving her a job because the alternative is just too horrific. \ud83d\ude05",

The Mulder and Scully conversation was sooo cute, and it speaks to what I've been saying. These two are just so comfortable around each other, they tell each other things they couldn't talk to anyone else about. They're constantly making fun of each other, but then casually move into flirting territory and bounce right back. Their conversations are such a delight to watch, and I feel like I'm actually watching two people fall in love.\n\nAlso my man trying to protect his ass from Bo Ra's imagination was so funny. The comedy in this show is just immaculate!!!!! Even just the small moment of Su Hyeok trying to hold Bo Ra back when he brakes, and she ends up choking on his arm bar.... too good.\n\nWhile Yu Ri's being a bit of a petty bitch, I don't think Bo Ra would ever try to put her down for whatever she's confided in Bo Ra about. Like she did call her out on it up front, but she wouldn't talk to Su Hyeok behind Yu Ri's back about it. Its pretty clear she cheated on him, and she's trying to throw herself a pity party now. So I hope Bo Ra can at least try to protect Su Hyeok from getting hurt further. Cus that man is in pain.",

The aftermath of last ep's event is pretty clear here, they are both stewing in their emotions now they've decided to be 'mature' (or not really) about what happened and I like that they're going for the characters realizing their feelings slowly and working them out largely on their own rather than a lot of sudden drama. Lots of people were concerned last ep that things were moving 'too fast' and this is them taking it slow after realizing they accelerated a bit too quickly without being sure of each other's feelings, noticing that they do care about each other etc.   \n\n\nPlus I think this ep did the most to explore the cracks in the best friend's relationship and also to push forward the issues with the 'young love' storyline of the army guy and sister.",

Either that or he's literally her brother in law and she has a sibling who his sibling is married to, but I think it's likely that she just knew him through them both being in the publishing industry and introduced him to her boss who is clearly a long-term/close friend of hers.",

It was kind of implied she didn't have enough time to react to him walking up behind Bora though since she looked up and noticed him when Bora was already mid-sentence and he was already standing behind them. This is a common trope in kdrama and I don't think the viewer is ever meant to think the friend 'had time to react.'  \n\n\nHer husband however definitely is trash, and I feel like this relationship is not gonna last the whole drama or if it is, something dramatic would have to happen first.",

In all of these relationships we saw a total breakdown of communication because either the woman tried to 'communicate' her needs so hard (to a nonreceptive person) that he started viewing her as oppressive, or the man was so passive that he refused or felt unable to communicate back.  \n\n\nDespite the stalkerish behaviour of army guy he is very clear with his feelings and intent from the beginning, to a degree that the sister gives him a chance even though he's cringe and kind of insensitive in everything he does. Rather than protecting his (and her) feelings he just goes for it and tells her he loves her, contacts her relentlessly etc. until she's motivated to try to make it work. He's also very receptive to everything she tells HIM about how to act and tries to read her feelings even when he messes up.  \n\n\nI don't think this is necessarily a healthy dynamic either since I find him too overbearing but I think their relationship is meant to serve as a counterexample contra the other couples where the men don't try at all, and in that sense it's kind of interesting.",

She told him straight up this is what was happening. Now 10ep later people are upset that she did what he encouraged her to do and she said she was doing?

Their relationship is flawed, communication is staggering and it appears that he has no sex drive whatsoever (at least not towards his gorgeous wife who is obviously very attracted to him). I wonder where the show is planning on taking this and whether they ever have  an honest conversation and deal with their issues. The divorced couple should be a mirror to them, as a portrayal of what happens when couples don\u2019t communicate. I think that what the show is going for here is the message: Love isn\u2019t everything in a relationship, communication is.  \nI have noticed that a lot of dramas show cheating as normal and the reaction to it is way more tolerant than western tv. Most western shows don\u2019t even discuss the option of ignoring or accepting cheating as a one time mistake. Even the fact that Bo Ra is talking about the option of the breakup to end in revenge OR reconciliation is mind boggling to me. I get that cheating can be complicated but I find too many shows being more tolerant towards the idea than I\u2019m comfortable with.",

I'm also basing this on their financial status/job positions, the fact they seem close with people obviously meant to be in their 40s (CEO and magazine boss) and the carding scene (you have to be born 1993 or later, so they're definitely all over 30). Both actors are around 40, while YuJeong (actress) is midlate 30s and Juhwan (actor) is earlymid 30s. So my guess is 36, 37.  \n\n\nThe two things that throw me a little are 1. no one in their group has kids, 2. the sister doesn't seem to have a job so I would assume she's just past college age but their relationship seems too close for sisters 15 years apart or so.",

Instead it is delivering pretty unvarnished reality and commentary on the messiness and unpleasantness of marriage, friendship, romance, etc. which can be really upsetting in how it reminds people too much of the downsides of relationships in reality rather than the idealized version of people and relationships in dramaland.   \n\n\nI think the hyperrealism is pushing people's buttons and they're criticizing the characters as if they were people they actually knew lol.",

They can't seem to understand or appreciate when characters behave like real humans, instead of, the caricature characters that are used in all Kdramas. I have been watching kdramas since 2012 but in 2017 I stopped watching because everything felt so basic, it was the same type of characters and the same boring storyline over and over again, nothing I haven't seen before,  I could appreciate that fact even as a 15 year old teenager. I started watching Kdramas again in 2020, I came back because of Lee Min Ho's new drama released that year and I continued watching because  of \" It's Okay that's Love\". That drama  introduced me to a new kind of Kdramas, the ones who make it a point to break the mold and portray realistic characters. All of my favorite kdramas ever fall into this category. My point is that Kdrama watchers need to be more open to realism in dramas, whether or not you like it , it's not going to be sunshine and rainbows all the time. Life is simply not a fairytale and I know some people use dramas as a method of escaping reality but that's not a reason to declare a drama horrible because it forces that unwanted truth down your throat.\n\n I have seen someone arguing on YouTube that she hated  Kdramas like  \"The Glory\" because they depict so much violence and bullying which is just an attempt to copy the western media and that Kdramas need to stick strictly romance story. However, bullying has always been an ever present theme in Kdramas even though it was glamorized in shows like Boys Before Flowers and The Heirs but now, the korean media has taken to criticizing it and showcasing just how horrible it is. Let's not also forget that bullying is a reality that many children of school age in Korea deal with on a daily basis and it has lead to hundreds of suicide but according to some people the korean entertainment industry are not allowed to use their media to reveal their societal issues, lest they offend their super fans who only want to watch fairytale romance. Bottom line,  people are going to find something to hate on, no matter how little.",

Curious what are your other favs in this category?  \n\n\nYou seem to be about a decade younger than me and it's interesting you say this because I often assume that the people who nitpick dramas like this are just younger people who can't relate to some of the plotlines, but now that you mention it I was a teen when I watched some of the classics like Boys over Flowers and I didn't appreciate the OTT dramatics/non-realism back then either.   \n\n\nI am one of the people who often watches kdramas for escapism/relaxation to decompress from harsh realities of real life so I'm OK with the out there fantasy plotlines and silliness of some of the popular dramas of this type (think Secret Garden, Goblin, Business Proposal and similar) but they never make it into my favorites since I find them less emotionally affecting and riveting than dramas with more realism and mature character dynamics. And like you said, they can get really boring and similar to the point they blend together for me. I've watched so many dramas and I'm surprised when people name My Love From The Star, Goblin, Legend of the Blue Sea, etc. as their top favourites because the characters and plotlines for these shows all start to blend together for me and I don't really remember anything specific about them since they are so trope-heavy.  \n\n\nIt's fine if people aren't into hyperrealistic dramas but I notice that when one airs and is popular it seems like a lot of people watch it while continuously criticizing it for every (realistically scripted) thing the characters do wrong, even though some of these things are far more minor than the egregious cluelessness and toxicity of some typical 'chaebol leads' and 'hardworking poor girl' characters in popular dramas. So you get threads like the one for this drama where people are absolutely blasting the scriptwriter and show for depicting more true-to-life situations even though that's exactly what I like about the show.  \n\n\nRe: the bullying thing, preach lol older kdramas like Playful Kiss and BOF literally glamorized bullying and psychological torture and now we're getting more honest shows dealing with issues like bullying and workplace toxicity (which are obviously VERY popular with Korean viewers) it's a problem? I too wish there were a few more lighthearted shows but some of my favs in the last year have dealt with the bullying issue (The Glory, King of Pigs, Weak Hero) and I think this speaks to current issues in SK that writers are trying to finally address with compassion.  \n\n\nGotta remember that the original 'hallyu wave' was a deliberate cultural export funded in large part by the SK government to try to take a market share of world entertainment properties and influence and that before cable channels started putting out lots of dramas the major broadcasters were subject to extremely strict censorship and moral standards similar to what is still common in China (no depicting of smoking, drugs, graphic violence, making out, certain 'moral failings' of main characters etc) so people who are used to that old 'cleaner' standard may be disappointed that the k-ent industry has started exploring grittier topics. But clearly they're making these grittier shows because audiences want them and domestic audiences still largely make the most money for these projects.",

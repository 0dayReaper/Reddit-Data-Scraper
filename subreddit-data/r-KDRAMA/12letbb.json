    "postText": "Ever watch a drama where by the time the ending credits roll for the final episode, you start wishing you can get a refund for your time spent? \n\nIf so, come to this thread to [lament](https://i.redd.it/cjahtu0e77z41.gif) about that drama you wish [you'd never watched](https://i.redd.it/y79jjzsnygg31.gif)!\n\nThis post is different from the *Dramas I Have Dropped* post in that these should be dramas you finished watching and then regretted watching as opposed to having dropped the drama midway. Colloquially referred to as *hate watch*. This thread is envisioned for both the completists in our community who cannot drop dramas and dramas that go off the rails at the last minute.\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they regretted watching certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all. We can learn from each other and maybe even be convinced by others as to why a drama may have been worth watching after all.\n\nYou are not limited to Kdramas, feel free to discuss non-Kdramas or movies too. We strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I felt the show is incomplete, don't really feel a resolution to the main conflict of the show (their divorce even though he still love her).\n\nI know it is realistic cause it is a deal break if one person wanted a marriage/children and the other don't, but maybe the romance in me would like to have a happy ending (maybe the trauma is from the mom cause he blame himself from &gt;!his sister death when they were children !&lt; and now he is good again with his mom, they can try again, he also seeing psychiatrist at the end of the show). The show left me feeling unfulfilled, that's all",

The exact reasons for this soul migration is often handwaved away, as that's not the point of the story.\n\n&gt;the growth and development of Jin Do-Jun and not Yoon Hyeon-Woo\n\nBut that's the thing. We did follow the growth and development of Yoon Hyeon-Woo. Because he was the one on screen. He overtook the life of Do-Jun, but he was not Do-Jun. We saw Hyeon-Woo developing a relationship with grandpa and we saw Hyeon-Woo trying to overtake the company. Others may have called him Do-Jun, and physically he may have been him. But in reality he was Hyeon-Woo. That's why he thought back on and tried to help his original family. That's why he wanted to take the company from the Jin Family, as they used and murdered him. That's why he had all his memories and with that the future (his past) knowledge.",

Boy, did I fall into that trap. It\u2019s the worst written show, not just kdrama, but show. No character establishment or development. No consistent tone established. Inconsistencies all around. Characters being introduced wildly throughout all 16 episodes (like wtf Lee Je Hoon\u2019s character introduced in EP15). And because the characters aren\u2019t established or developed, it feels like they\u2019re often making nonsensical decisions or having nonsensical emotions. Plot lines get introduced then just never mentioned again. Nothing is ever resolved. Nothing makes sense. There are no stakes. There is no plot. Never mind the ending on what happens to the ML, don\u2019t even get me started that the ending scene foreshadows a possible season 3.",

The FL is also not good and her mannerisms and personality are annoying. But I really love Kwak Dong-yeon as well (and he's not playing a character who gets offed) so I've been pushing through, but very slowly.\n\nThe Blue Whisperer (cdrama) - I just couldn't deal with the FL spending majority of the series! &gt;!captured and imprisoned!&lt;. How that's supposed to make for an interesting drama is beyond me...",

I finished it, out of interest in understanding if it was me being confused or the editing was really choppy\u2026 random jumps, some writing oopsies (weird dialogues), the revenge reasoning felt week, pretty obsessive behaviour on both ends. Also, where and when did romance initiate between the leads? I have no idea, but at some point i just got to accept that they were in love and be ok with it. Everyone wanted to marry the ML, but other than being a ceo, the guy isn\u2019t a great catch imo, he has judgmental preconceptions about women. Also, I\u2019m tired of the SML plot where he must chase the FL as the true love he lost because he moved abroad suddenly.. very templated behaviour.",

But man was I in for disappointment. The ML was an actual misogynist who had no arc cause he was miso until the end. The SML was actually talking about trapping the FLs. The second FL was annoying and I didn't understand her character's notions at all. The FL was the only good cause she wasn't the \"I'm not like other girls\" type. Ppl were saying proper romcoms are back because of this drama but I'd rather take a romcom like **Crash Course In Romance** with an annoying sideplot over this kinda stuff because CCIR got its main characters right and it was a delight to watch the actors and their chemistry",

The chemistry was almost nonexistent to my eyes, the pacing was too slow at times, the camerawork was off, it lacked character development\u2026 Not the worst drama out there but definitely very far from being great.\n\nAnother one was **Love Like the Galaxy** (cdrama). Great production value, good acting by Zhao Lusi and stellar chemistry between the main leads, but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t get used to Wu Lei\u2019s acting, he\u2019s always expressionless and when he tries to convey any kind of emotion it turns out terrible. His character was even worse, he was very toxic towards Niaoniao, their couple dynamics was clearly problematic and the way he did everything to marry her and abandon her afterwards was hard to digest. I get why he did that but that doesn\u2019t make it alright. Niaoniao\u2019s family was also very abusive and most of their scenes were a pain to watch. I know historical dramas tend to be full of messed up relationships but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to tone it down a little considering it\u2019s a drama targeted to younger audiences.",

So much emotional abuse, suffering and bullying between the ML and FL leads. Coercive control, dysfunctional relationships, cruel, unethical and I would say illegal behaviours by the MLs so called friends, manager and mother. It was unrelenting. I kept watching, largely because of Kim Woo-bins strong performance and hoping for some lighter and happier moments of which there were so few. People trying to redeem themselves towards the end was far too little and too late, in particular the mother. While I can handle a certain amount of angst/suffering in dramas I prefer to watch dramas that have more happier moments.",

I won't do spoilers. \n\nSo the first season was right up my alley: Japanese drama about a group of tight- knit young friends who somehow get transported to a Tokyo that's become a murder game. Hapless participants try to gather playing cards by surviving challenges themed by the suit of the cards, with higher numbers having more dramatic stakes physically and emotionally. The show is super gory and the characters are detailed and diverse. \n\nI enjoyed the first season, loved some of the characters, cried like a baby. Then S2 rolled around and imo, it was just a grueling, ultra violent slog that ruined my emotional investment in the characters. S2 turned into what early 2000s horror movies were: torture porn. \n\nI still retain an affection for the first season and just felt sad at the end of the second.",

Also there was no need to dedicate 3 episodes just for Kyuma. The other games were also draggy and disappointing.\n\nAnother thing that was off was the chemistry. It was definitely missing comparing to the first season, it almost felt like Arisu and Usagi were forced into being together\u2026",

The group of friends &gt;!had to face the Seven of Hearts.!&lt; There was already tons of violence throughout S1, but the &gt;!Ten of Hearts pushed everyone to cull each other. Leaving just Usagi and the few beach members to follow him into S2 where most of them end up surviving despite how stupid the King of Spades game was. +The reveal of what Borderlands actually was.!&lt; The only way S2 could have been considered torture porn is if the friends had to play &gt;!King of Diamonds, otherwise nothing beats Seven of Hearts in terms of torture.!&lt;\n\nTLDR: Idk if I'm desensitized, but S2 was mild (In terms of what you call torture porn).",

No matter how much characters wanted to help each other, the nature of the games made them unwilling accomplices to their friends' suffering. In s2, the survivors were split up after the KoS, so they could have whole games with only one character I cared about involved, so I didn't feel that conflict of unwittingly contributing to the pain of someone you cared about. As badly as I felt for the victims just because they're people and they were suffering, it wasn't the same as watching a character I liked suffer emotionally. \n\nNot sure if that makes sense, but I just found the situations in s2 for the most part less vital than s1, and then it just felt like gross for edginess.",

It's more focused on revenge than the aspects of law, which is what initially drew me to the show. \n\nAnother view that might be unpopular is Fiery Priest. I really like Kim Nam-gil's acting, however, I've never been able to finish a drama with Kim Sung-kyun at the lead. I'm not sure why I don't like his acting, or maybe it's just the characters he plays.  \n\nFinal one is I married the anti-fan. I've heard good things about it, but I personally didn't find it funny. The plot never made its mind up from my perspective.",

Dumb storyline that the ML talks to a \"ghost\" so openly without trying to conceal it, stupid way to confront the villain, etc. I regretted watching this one.",

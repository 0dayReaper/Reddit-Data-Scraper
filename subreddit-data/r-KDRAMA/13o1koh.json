    "postText": "I am not finding anything really compelling is playing right now (apart from maybe Dr. Romantic 3) and I was going to watch some old favorites. Then, as I was considering rewatching Secret Garden, I saw The King 2 Hearts on Ha Ji Won's Viki list.\n\nI had never seen this show recommended, but the cast looked amazing. Ha Ji Won as a North Korean Special Forces officer and Lee Seung Gi as a South Korean prince falling in love, then Jo Jung Suk, Lee Sung Min...an alternative reality where South Korea still has a king that has to deal with North-South relations? Right up my alley as a modern-day sageuk.\n\nI almost dropped it on Episode 1. Ha Ji Won as Kim Hang Ah went seamlessly from fierce super soldier to pouty girl who just wants to get married which was very different from her other strong woman roles. Lee Seung Gi as Prince Lee Jae Ha was insufferably spoiled and weak. The whole premise felt contrived, but I kept going. Maybe it was Lee Sung Min as the earnest and benevolent older brother and King. Maybe it was Youn Yuh Jung showing up as the tentative Queen Mother. Could such star power be wasted?\n\nOnce this show clicks, you cannot turn it off!\n\nI will not give spoilers on the storyline beyond the scant Viki intro because I would deprive watchers of a crazy ride and there are some old reviews on the sub. I'll just give you the premise of why I thought it was so good and worth revisiting.\n\nFirst of all, Kim Hang Ah personality which so irked me at the beginning, becomes her charm thanks to Ha Ji Won. Hang Ah is both a powerful warrior and a woman who can be deeply vulnerable and the two are not mutually exclusive. Her feelings get hurt a lot, but she will never give up and is always there to save the day.\n\nPrince Lee Jae Ha is a mess. Spoiled, cowardly, jaded. The King says at the beginning he hopes Hang Ah can whip him into shape. Well, she does. Lee Seung Gi always manages to keep him charming even when you want to strangle him. His character has the biggest arc in the show and all the realizations, confusions, fears, and newfound determination show on Lee Seung Gi's face. The development of the relationship with Hang Ah and the two becoming true equals is absolutely precious and very well done.\n\nThere are many people that guide Jae Ha in his journey and Jo Jung Suk plays his guard and right-hand man who is stoic and righteous. You don't get any of the winking charm he shows in other characters, but I can see how he shined as leading man material after this show....and he still got to sing.\n\nEveryone else's acting is perfect. Almost every character has a full character development which is sometimes unexpected. You get to know them so well, that you feel for almost everyone and there will be a lot of tears. It was a very good use of 20 episodes.\n\nUnderlying the romance is geopolitical strife and other governments and political actors trying to destabilize the Korean peninsula. The Big Bad is the head of a military-supply conglomerate who needs to keep everyone fighting at all times to make money. He's an unhinged evil villain who can control countries and the actions of the world's superpowers. Sometimes he feels like the scheming Left State Minister that you can never take down in sageuks with the difference that he can start World War 3 like in a James Bond movie. \n\nThis show may be dated and too idealistic at times, but the global scope is very different from what I had seen in other K-dramas with tons of foreign actors for all the international issues and a lot of insight into politics. And the actual enemies-to-lovers romance that becomes the key point of the story is top-notch.",

It was throwning me for a loop why I instantly disliked him and thought him sus, until I finally remembered he was the Big Bad of The King2Hearts.\n\n...super ironically, he and the King show up in Reborn Rich, playing the eldest son of not!Samsun and the father, Chairman of not!Samsung, respectively. There was much thonk at that, lol :P",

I have intended to write a complete review, but never got around to it. Maybe in 6 months...\n\nBut I'm so glad you wrote this and called attention to it. Yes, the acting is top-notch, the characters are wonderful, and the underlying idealistic theme of at least cooperation (not reunification, though) is a big draw for me. The only reason it gets a 9.5/10 for me instead of 10/10 is the cartoonish, over-the-top villains.\n\nI just loved Lee Seung Gi and Ha Ji Won in these roles, and this was my introduction to the glorious Jo Jung-Seuk and Lee Joon Ji. I was already a Lee Sung Min fan.\n\nYes, this is a Hidden Gem!",

            "comment": "I watched it because the director is Jung Dae-Yun (with another director). He regularly proposes surprising or movie-inspired scenes. Like this one for example: [https://twitter.com/EnchanteurW/status/1657584828953272321](https://twitter.com/EnchanteurW/status/1657584828953272321)\n\nAs far as the drama is concerned, I loved it. There is a growing tension and I could not breathe during the last episode so intense. It's good about Alternate history (uchronie) and a bit of geopolitics.\n\nThe actress Ha Ji Won did a good job to render the North Korean accent and attitude. This is surprising at first, because she has a strange way of speaking that you don't usually hear in her other roles. The personality of the character is surprising, contradictory, but also consistent with a North Korean woman. We see it in her dates at the beginning.\n\nThe confrontations between the villain and the king are harsh and excellent. Excellent villain, who embodies an international group, one could say a symbol of international finance in the broad sense. The guy seems clownish, but you quickly see how sinister he is. I loved the actor. As usual in kdramas, the drama makes us think of a North-South conflict, but we quickly see that the real source of the conflict is foreign presences, americans, finance.\n\nI often quote kdrama about \"best first episode\". But this one it's rather \"best final episode\". K2H first episode is weird, we don't know what is the mood of the drama. There is comedy but in a way you don't know it's parody or if it's supposed to be funny. I was about to drop. But I was a bit hooked so strange is this mood, I don't see that usually. So I've keep watching, and episode 2 was \"woo!\". As soon as I watched the scene I posted, for sure I wanted to watch all.",

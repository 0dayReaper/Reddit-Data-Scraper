    "postText": "It's time to vote for the couples in Group C!\n\nFor this round, you can vote for as many couples in each group that you want. The site will then seed them according to the total number of votes received as well by comparing with the total votes for each group. Seeding is done mainly to avoid couples with higher votes being matched-up too early.\n\nHead [here](https://animebracket.com/favourite-kdrama-couple-from-2020-2021-2022/vote) to vote!\n\nTo see the full list of dramas, you can click on the entrants tab.\n\nFeel free to comment on the couples in Group C and who you think will make the top seeds.",

The characters play to the respective actors' strengths. Shin Woo Yeo has a stoic quality that suits Jang Ki-yong perfectly, while Hyeri makes Lee Dam both sympathetic and likable.",

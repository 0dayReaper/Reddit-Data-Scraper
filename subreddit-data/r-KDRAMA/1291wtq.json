The orchestral music in this drama just gives me so many feels because of how in tune it is with what's happening on screen. I don't know if it's because it's a rewatch and I know the ending so my heart is reassured but I'm finding the romantic scenes *so much more* romantic this time around since I can enjoy it without worries.",

            "comment": "In an attempt to get to bed earlier, I decided to watch some dramas with shorter length (sorry 70- episode cdrama I have to go to work).\n\nFirst I watched a cdrama called **The Ghost Bride** and it was so adorably macabre! Only 6 episodes, it crammed in a lot of tropes. It's set in Malacca in 1890 and it's not a setting I have any experience with so it was nice to see something exotic and unfamiliar. The leads were all great, the plot was short and sweet. \n\nTrust fund brat dies and his mom wants him to have a Ghost Bride which is apparently where you marry the corpse and then when you die, you're together in the afterlife? I think? Small echoes of Goblin when a Heavenly Guard shows up, and the adventure is on. Very enjoyable. \n\nThen i started the short kdrama **sound of magic** and it's a creepy musical but I'm loving it so far. It's like Willy Wonka in a way (the Gene Wilder movie version) only with hot people singing. \n\nHappy Palm Sunday to those who celebrate!",

Both leads were beautiful. The main villain was probably the worst but he is pretty evil so he doesn't have an arc or anything lol.",

It's silly, FL is OTT a lot of the time but also swoony. So yeah I watched 14 episodes already. \n\nI also watched episode 1 of **Oasis** and I love the set up and the aesthetics so much. The fake tan though lmao. I had to look up the actors' previous works to figure out where I had seen them before lol. It's a heavy drama so I might take my time with it. I love the music in this drama. Not just the ost but the 80s music they have used. Somebody please make a playlist of all the music used in this drama.",

The long shots of people staring dramatically at each other make me giggle every time but I'm choosing to ignore it. So Ra is absolutely unhinged, which makes sense with an asshole of a father like that. She's awful to everyone, but I can't feel bad for her employees because, oh my god, they voluntarily went to work for her and *stayed*! Like seriously, they are getting slapped by their hysterical boss almost every episode and they are still there and *loyal*? Lmao.\n\nBy the episode 10 Ra El is finally going full on crazy on them and it's FUN. I can't wait for her to drop some more bombs on them all, including Yoon Gyum.\n\nAnyway, I roll my eyes a lot but I'm really into it and curious how it's all gonna end.\n\nOr, and on a non-kdrama related note, I just binged the second season of **Mayor of Kingstown** and loved every minute of it. I have no idea why everyone's complaining. I would have watched ten more seasons, if we had them. I also recognized the actor playing Carney as a guy from Prison Break where he was super young and now he's... not, and damn, it made me so sad. That was so long ago and we all got so old and time just freaking flies...",

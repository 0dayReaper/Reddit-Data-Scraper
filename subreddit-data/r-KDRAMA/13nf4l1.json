            "comment": "I just finished **Agency**, and I loved it. It is one of those dramas that has reached in and wrapped itself around my heart. I am sad that it is finished. I wish there was more of it. I wish that I could spend more time with these characters and in this world.\n\n(Not Just Good But) **Great Things**:\n\n* This is a story about women - a woman's place in the world, as a mother, as a wife, as a person looking to make a living, as a person looking to be taken seriously. As one example, there is one interaction where the main character - who is practically running the agency at this point - says to a man (who wants her to do a task that she could do but would be much more appropriately assigned to a junior staff member), \"You don't even see me.\" He responds, \"Of course I see you. You look very pretty in that suit.\" There are many micro-interactions like this that make it clear that the drama understands how demeaning it can be and how demoralizing to experience that on a regular basis. If you are someone who cares about the Bechdel test, which at its foundation is about the complexity of women's lives and women's stories, this drama will speak to you. \n* This is also a story about growth, and connection, and the balance between what we owe to ourselves and what we owe to others, and what it costs when we get that balance wrong in either direction. I was invested in each of the stories that explored this theme.\n* This is also a story about work/life balance, but in a real way, and not a sappy follow-your-bliss kind of way. People who opt out of the rat race pay a price, and for some it is more worth it than for others. But there is a price for staying in the rat race as well, not just with respect to how you feel, but also with respect to who you become and the other life choices that you make.\n* This is a drama that deals with the realities of stress, trauma, and mental health in a compassionate way. &gt;!People actively refuse to stigmatize seeking help!&lt;.\n* The characters are so real, and they are multi-dimensional. They make both good and bad choices, and as we learn more about them, we understand their choices and develop compassion for them. It is said that everyone is the hero of their own story, and you can see that in this drama, as the story moves in and then moves out so we see an individual's experience and then the bigger picture. \n* Most of the characters are kind. The drama felt compassionate. People stand up for each other. They challenge each other to be their best selves, and have compassion for each other when they fall short. They live in a difficult world, but also a world where people help each other.\n* Being a parent is portrayed as complex, and parents are human, not just black and white (good parent vs. bad parent).\n* There are multiple great father-child interactions and relationships - something that I have seen less frequently in other dramas, where fathers can be reduced to placeholders.\n* It is \\*so\\* well written and directed. And it speaks to the heart. &gt;!The \"Eommaga miyanhae.\" scene!&lt; moved me to tears.\n* The acting is excellent. Lee Bo Young is phenomenal in this role, as someone who is bristly and driven and flawed, but warm. Cho Seong Ha finds just the right notes of self-satisfaction to make him a perfect foil. It is nice to see Kim Mi Kyung in a role that showcases her ability to play more than just the \"perfect mom\". I am now in love with Han Byung Soo, played by Lee Chang Hoon. (Just saying.) These are just the performances that come first to mind. I can't think of an actor whose performance fell short. \n* The OST was very much to my taste: melodic, beautiful, evocative, well-integrated with the story and the mood. I was introduced to a couple new artists as well, which is always nice. More rabbit holes to explore!\n* I don't have the technical expertise to talk about cinematography, lighting, editing, etc, but it was pleasing, and did not distract or pull me out of the story.\n\n**Things That Were Less Great**: The gripes that I have about this drama are very minor, and did not in any way negatively impact my experience of watching it. They are almost universally related to characters that I wanted to know more about or feel more connected to.\n\n* Some of the male characters who support the female characters are less well developed - although not to the Attorney Woo extent. I felt like I understood the motivations of the male characters and their reasons for being in the relationships they were in. But at times I would have liked to know more about them and their stories. (But there is only so much you can do in 16 episodes, so I cut the drama some slack for that.)\n* It is my theory that every drama needs at least one irredeemable bad guy, and this drama is no exception. There are two or three - a couple of which are minor characters - who don't get the character development that might have helped us see their side of the story. It's only disappointing because the character development of everybody else is so strong and so well-rounded that it can feel a little bit like they were stuck there as placeholders just to move the story along. (Reborn Rich did a better job with a very similar patriarch, for example. But RR was also the patriarch's story and here that character is powerful, but not the central player.)\n* I found the chaebol world and the people in  it to be less richly developed and less real than the other characters in the story - more like standard elitist tropes rather than real people. I'm guessing that the writer either has less experience with that world and/or less interest in or sympathy for those characters.\n* The ending, while good, is not as powerful as the rest of the drama. It feels like there was some pressure to wrap everything up in a nice neat bow.\n\n**Interesting Things**:\n\n* I would have liked to know more about the mothers of the Woowon Group and the VC Group. They simply did not exist, which is an interesting choice for a drama so focused on women's experiences in the world. Was it that the writer didn't have much to say about the role of wealthy women in traditional families? Or that she has a great deal to say, but didn't want to oversimplify it and perhaps is saving that for a future drama (fingers crossed? Or was it a commentary - that once children exist, women in traditional wealthy families essentially cease to exist as significant players in the world? Food for thought.\n* This is the writer's first drama. She knocked it out of the park. I can't wait to see what else she has in story.\n\nYou should watch this drama if:\n\n* You enjoyed **Search:WWW** and are open to something in the same vein but a little less manic\n* You enjoyed **Lost**, and are looking for something just as thoughtful and deep, but less heavy\n* You enjoyed **Misaeng**. (**Misaeng** didn't grab my interest, but I think if you are one of the people who liked **Misaeng**, you might also like **Agency**.)\n* You had high hopes for **Forecasting Love and Weather**, even if it let you down.\n\nTL:DR: Watch **Agency**. It's simply outstanding. 10/10",

Kinda sad it didn\u2019t get wide release when it aired.  \n\nIt was one of the shows with woman in business owning it, however she was not superhero or deus ex machina, she needed help on every step, she had to make friends, and rely on them to make breakthroughs happen, it was teamwork that shined and leadership she provided made her great.  I think that was what made this series great.",

            "comment": "[Call it Love (2023)](https://mydramalist.com/726339-tell-me-it-s-love)\n\n**Good Things** : While the show is very slow, somehow it excels at keeping you engaged. I had no trouble binging it. \n\nThe characters are flawed but likable. They seem like real human being with their own struggles and reasoning. \n\nThe acting is beyond amazing. The microexpressions communicate as much as the dialogue. It contributes to the show feeling real to the viewer. \n\nIt is easy to root for the main couple. They help each other being the best version of themselves. \n\nThe obstacles of them being together seem justified given their background.\u00a0 For example, the FL's father chose romantic love over family, which made their life a living hell, so I understand why she doesn't want to do the same thing. \n\nThe expression of love (romantic and other) is sincere and profound. The care given by love interests, family members and friends to each other touches a deep human cord. \n\n**Bad things**: I have only one issue with the show. I dislike how the character of the ex was handled. &gt;! I mean, she cheated\non the ML for the whole year. Then, ditched him to marry an other guy.!&lt; Well, that is awful, but I can see how someone can repent and move on from this.&gt;! However, after realizing that she was wrong, she moves into the apartment in front of his. It goes to the point where the ML sleeps in the hotel in order to avoid her.!&lt; Imo, that woman is a restraining order waiting to happen. Besides, I don't understand what is her story arc. &gt;!She only lets go of the ML because she understands that she has no chance with him!&lt;, so I don't really see her learning anything. Yeah, she regrets hurting him, but she doesn't seem to grasp that she hurts him even more by harassing him. &gt;!And with all of that she is given a happy ending.!&lt; Idk, I don't get it. \n\nRant over.\n\n**Interesting things**: I like how they juxtapose being painfully direct, to the point of hurting other people, to being painfully repressed, to the point of hurting yourself. The show concludes that neither strategy is great and, while one character learns to handle issues gracefully, the other learns to speak up. \n\nI absolutely adore how the issue with the ML's\u00a0 mother is handled!\u00a0 The show made obvious that vengence and hate eat deeply at your own character. \n\nBy the end of the show, protagonists carry themselves with dignity and care more about protecting the ones that they love than hurting the ones that they hate. However, with all of that in mind, what had to be said has been said. \n\n**Verdict**: Call it Love was a big surprise for me. While it is very slow, I didn't see the time pass while watching it. It is a wonderful show that I absolutely recommend.",

            "comment": "I just finished **Mr. Sunshine** and can totally recommend it.\n\n**Good things:** So many! Amazing cinematography, excellent OST, wonderful acting by the cast. Integrity in the storytelling. Fun bromance, and two terrific female leads. It deserves all the hype it gets.\n\n**Bad things:** I found it incredibly slow in the beginning and, at first, a little hard to follow. It helps to have some historical background going in, because some tings aren't well explained and the drama seems to expect that its audience doesn't need explanation. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/121ia4i/mr_sunshine_historical_and_cultural_backgrounders/) by u/plainenglish2 is really helpful, but does have spoilers. Also, the subject matter is heavy; it's about the occupation of Korea by Japan. It's also more violent than most kdramas I've seen. Not bad things per se, just go into it knowing that it will be heavy and violent at times.\n\nAlso, the scenes depicting the White House in the US don't look at all like the White House. The name \"Kyle\" for the American soldier is period inappropriate, as is the English handwriting, which at the time would have been much more formal. But I quibble.\n\n**Interesting things:** I'm not even sure where to start with this one. I think the historical background is interesting. Some of the characters in the drama are based on actual historical figures. It will likely make you interested in learning more about this time period.\n\n**Verdict:** This is an \"A\" drama. It's beautiful, though-provoking, and heavy hitting.",

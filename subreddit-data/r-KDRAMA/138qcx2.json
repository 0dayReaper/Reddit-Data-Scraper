But it surprised me (in a good way). It feels super whimsical and nostalgic, reminiscent of being young and growing up. Another comment mentioned the Reply series and 2521 and I would 100% classify it the same way. Like it feels super playful and fun and focused on friendships and familial relationships, but there is a sad undertone to it. \n\nHonestly the only thing I didn\u2019t like about the show is the female lead. I adore both the guys, the grandma, even Sehun\u2019s divorced parents are hilarious and fun to watch. But the female lead is ridiculously bland and devoid of personality. She is so monotone and barely there. The character description might as well be \u201cpretty girl\u201d cause that\u2019s about all she adds to the plot ( very strictly talking about the character here). Honestly I remember when I first read the character descriptions I thought this might be a BL and now I feel like the show would have worked even better if it was.",

But at the same time, the adult characterization is more interesting to me than the teen version. I feel intrigued by her, not annoyed. However I think it\u2019s because their not really giving the younger version anything to work with. Once they give her a plot line I\u2019m eager to see whether she will be more dynamic and interesting to watch. I guess I just wish they had hinted to more of it in the first two episodes, cause compared to the guys she\u2019s feels like a caricature.",

She's very angry and defensive which makes me actually more interested in what caused her to put all her walls up. But now that you mention it, the reason she chose to pursue &gt;!wealth through fame rather than following her academic inclinations!&lt; could also be part of her story. There is definitely something that influenced that decision. We kinda see the theme of &gt;!absent parents and loss of siblings!&lt; emerging so I think her relationship with her older brother, &gt;!who seems like the only person she truly loves and trusts,!&lt; will come into play here too.",

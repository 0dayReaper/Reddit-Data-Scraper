There was another scene where JH seems to remember something GY experienced (he is studying then looks down at his hands, then it cuts to a scene of GY dribbling a basketball).",

Go Yoo is super extroverted, socially confident, and well-liked, so he is willing and able to wear his heart on his sleeve. He often shows up for others whenever they're in need. While Joon Hee is more reserved, cautious, and focused on his studies. Given his friend's outward expressions, I can see why he'd find it difficult to confess and understand his own feelings. \n\nI really don't want to see a sad GY, given how much love and kindness he exudes.",

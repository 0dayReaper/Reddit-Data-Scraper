It required some suspension of disbelief at time, but... the show never pretended to be more than it ever was nor did it ever feel pretentious, so I forgive shortcomings from it, it was just the right length too. If it was 16 episodes, that would've been entirely too much for a show like this.",

I've always enjoyed getting to know more about historical and cultural facts and its great that everything set up in the show revolves around that - including the motivations of the crazy villain.\n\nA show like this benefited from a 12 episode run with the general storyline remaining tight and moving sensibly. A lot of other shows I've watched have gone haywire with extra episodes, so I'm hoping this one wraps up nicely for the finale.\n\nTill next time, Skunk!\n\nAlso, Ngl when I watch the last scene I legit thought &gt;! Kim Young Soo was going to have a heart attack from laughing so loud lmao!&lt;",

It was really nice seeing Joo Won again who I feel like I haven't seen in forever. Also, appreciate the Japanese colonial element going strong in his works (shall I rewatch Gaksital.. maybe! lol).\n\nI wish this was an easier show to watch so that maybe we had a bit more engagement in the posts. I think they did a good job telling a full story and linking everything together. No filler. Good acting. Good action!",

I would have loved to watch more of the 'cases', once the team was all together it was a good mix together. The drawback to the short run and ensemble cast was there wasn't quite enough time to fully flesh everyone out, some of them felt a little one-dimensional. \n\nMy favourite character was actually Hin Dal, of all of them he felt the most complete and complex. I'm a sucker for a tragic morally ambiguous backstory and I quite liked his. \n\nIf you get a chance it's a solid watch.",

The relationship between Dae Myung and Mrs. Lee especially. \n\nThe main villain grandpa is fun at chewing the scenery, and his right hand man Viper is my favourite character. He is a character with some of the most depth and has the most interesting character arc IMO. \n\nThe setting regarding the cultural heritage association and the treasures is very interesting, and I really enjoyed the treasure hunting and robbery aspect of the show. One of the high points are the puzzle rooms and the twist regarding them and the chairman.\n\nOverall, just fun.",

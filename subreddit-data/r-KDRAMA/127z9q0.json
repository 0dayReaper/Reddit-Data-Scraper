Do it here and see who else is late to the party like you!\n\nThis is our weekend check-in to talk about what you have been watching lately.\n\nAs you are well aware it's easy to be late to the party so **please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted.

At first I was judging from the title alone that I may not really enjoy this show but so far its been a  great comfort.\n\nI really thought this was going to be another bubblegum,cute romance but no. It's got mystery, darkness, comedy and social commentary. Tertiary characters! Background characters with personality! Little things like that are great to me. I was NOT expecting to like this as much as I am.\n\nIt also got me digging into my closet for my college math books. I've never felt such a drive to study just for the fun of it. \n\nI like the touch of ED discussion and the way that can come about. I found that a bit relatable and it adds a depth to a character without being performative.\n\nAnyway I'm definitely putting other work  and dramas aside to binge this one. Its really something.",

Kim Okbin's hilarious expressions and embarassing dance drew me in, but seriously, the character of Nam Kangho reminded me why female writers in the K-entertainment industry write the best romcoms. The drama is unapolegitcally feminist, and this male lead loves our girl as a whole package, &gt;!even when subjected to a character assasination by netizens for being proudly feminist in a patriarchal culture. K-entertainment is really no joke!&lt;\n\nTo be fully known and fully loved - ah, that's bliss - and our writers know that's what draws us viewers in.\n\nI agree with people who think this is the best rom-com of 2023.

When (also big spoiler) &gt;!Jin Bu Yeon and everybody keep saying \"you just got one day together\", \"she will disappear\", and the stupid empty coffins that they put out before the war hardly begun.!&lt;\n\nI think I understand now why (big spoiler) &gt;!Jin Bu Yeon/Seol Ran chose Naksu, because she needed a \"strong soul\" to be able to retrieve her divine powers!&lt;, which apparently took some time. But the clue to this is in only one sentence, and a bit hard to pick up when your head is full of \"what will happen now?\"\n\nThe last few episodes are so mixed between scenes of really high quality, or at least the start/the notes that could have been developed into a very high quality dialogue, but the cheap thrills and the bad execution of several scenes overwhelm it so the good scenes easily gets lost in between. \n\nI speculate that those high quality scenes where planned out when they started writing the drama, but of some reason they weren't able to follow through at the last moment.",

I loved **Yoo Yeon-seok** in **Hospital Playlist** and **Reply 1994** but boy, was so so annoying in the intial eps here. I understand the trope of being at loggerheads with the Teacher at first only to be humbled later but he got on my nerves cause of his holier-than-thou attitude. But on the other hand I'm two eps into Season 2 and although I still find the drama predictable and too melo I'm really liking **Ahn Hyo-seop**. His character has some conviction and already making me root for him. Hope I don't fast forward this season like I did the previous season cause I love **Lee Sung-kyung** and already liking her chemistry with **AHS**",

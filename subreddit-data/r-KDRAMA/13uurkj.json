It is schedule to premiere on August 11th\n\n&gt;Japanese actor Masanari Wada will take the lead role as Vincenzo Cassano, a lawyer and mafia leader. Veteran lawyer Hong Cha-young, who plots revenge against Vincenzo, will be played by J-pop singer and actor Suzuka Tomita.\n\nIf they post it online I will definitely watch it. I am curious to see how they changed it to a musical",

It's an amazing musical, with the Korean version starring (god) [Kim Junsu](https://youtu.be/pxFLq7AF3a8).\n\nIt's been running for around 8-9 years now? in Korea but I'm pretty sure the Japanese version stopped running by now. Although the Korean version *does* take breaks (Korean musical \"seasons\" differ from, say Broadway or the West End, especially when idols are involved) that's still a very long time.",

Of all the K-dramas that could be adapted into a musical, this is one of the easiest to imagine what its realization would look like.",

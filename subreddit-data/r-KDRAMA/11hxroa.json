I cannot express my happiness\n\nEdited for further clarification : I absolutely don\u2019t condone cheating . Sua\u2019s mom is 100% the victim here for no fault of her own. No one should be victim-blamed. Unfortunately, she has been victim-blaming all this time. She asked Sun-jae be expelled from the school because of the leaked paper, when he was the victim. So, I am hoping that her current predicament  will help her realize that often people become victims in situation where they have no control , and exploiting the victim or the victim\u2019s situation for own personal gains is absolutely unacceptable. I pray that she reflect the pain/injustices that she has inflicted on others and heal through that process. This is what I meant by justice .",

The idea that she\u2019s not specifically Hae-e\u2019s mom has just kind of been underlying everything. They haven\u2019t truly dealt with the idea that she\u2019s not literally her mom and really resolved it that it\u2019s ok. There was always some lingering bit of doubt or fear that she would show up like that and wreck them, but now they can really close that out one way or another.",

And Mr. Choi is totally fine within 20 mins of an episode after learning his assistant killed 3 people because of him!! How are you supposed to get over that? I thought the people will be asking questions as to why 2 kids and a teacher were murdered. And they will start blaming Mr. Choi. Isn't that more logical? Instead he is shown to be smiling and celebrating after few days. Even Hae-yi is shown to be totally fine. She is bothered about her bio mom now. What about her trauma with Mr. Ji. What's her reaction to his death? Did she lose those memories? Has she not seen the news? \n\nThe girl who Mr. Ji killed earlier was totally forgotten as well! Why aren't the parents of the boy student who died infuriated with Mr. Choi?\n\nI think they crammed 2 or 3 eps in 1 ep. All the above things should have been shelled out and given proper closure but they just don't have time. This happened because there's 2 completely different genres and plots in one drama.  \n\nAnyway I'm enjoying everything being back to normal now! It's back to being the great drama that we all knew. Hope last episode is all of them being happy. And the bio mom pisses off.",

It was always meant to end tragically.  That was the purpose of that arc.\n\nI wouldn't say that Mr. Choi is totally fine. He had reverted to his old habit of brooding alone in his house and using sleeping pills.  It was not 20 minutes later, but days later.  Then HS showed up to rescue him from his self-imposed misery.  It is meant to contrast with his earlier guilt about the girl who committed suicide, and how it haunted him for years.  This time he has some real support.  Someone who will yank him out of that headspace and tell him, rightly so, that he can't be responsible for what other people do.  \n\nCould they have done this any other way? Maybe.  They wanted to show at least one tragic arc.  I don't think it would have been better if the person chosen for that tragic arc was someone we liked.  Imagine if Mr. Ji had not been guilty of killing a bunch of people.    At least this made us acknowledge that there was no other outcome possible for him, sad as it was.\n\nThe drama was really mislabeled, tragically so.  It wasn't a rom-com.",

I hope he gets recognition in the department and gets promoted and becomes a star cop. Kudos also to his boss who supported him and shielded him from superiors!!!  I really really hope the last episode spends some time on his achievement (unlikely though, so many other loose ends to wrap up)",

And by showing Su Ah's mum get the exact payback, it makes it seem like the wrong that she did wasn't wrong in the first place because now that she's got the same treatment it's somehow *fair*. There is no true learning for Su Ah's mum or for all the people who ran with the gossip. It's like saying 'if you do evil, it'll come to you in the same way',  when it should be 'don't do evil because it's wrong'.",

Truly, all the side characters (teenage actors, Sunjae's brother, and Mr. Ji) have done a wonderful job portraying their characters. I'd love to see more of them in other works. \n\nI'm okay with Mr. Ji's ending, I think it made a lot of sense given everything we know about his sad story. What bugs me is the AFTERMATH of his ending. We got to see Mr. Choi sad for about 30 seconds and then.... nothing? He just lost his only friend/family that he has had for years through an extremely traumatic betrayal and he's just fine? Hae-yi was kidnapped, chased, in a coma...and we've just moved on? The parents and school were absolutely furious and on a witch hunt when they thought Mr. Choi was dating a student's mom but no one cares that his assistant was murdering his students and colleagues? Like really? How is this not affecting his career in any way? I appreciate that they are trying to tie up all the loose ends, but to me they created too many side stories to give them all a satisfying ending.\n\nI do love the communication and trust of our main leads. They have been consistently fantastic and sweet. I hope our final episode sees everyone happy in some way.",

I'm also loving the fact that these two communicate. I was so surprised when he admitted his feelings during the karaoke scene instead of brushing it off or lying and when she was upset because he didn't believe her about Mr Ji, she said she needed space to think about things. She didn't break up with him, she just needed to process. There's a maturity to their relationship that I really love and it doesn't take away from those moments when they are giddy about each other. Definitely more of this please! \ud83d\ude0d",

His 'bro-to-bro' conversation with Chi-yeol when the latter was sleeping over kinda rubbed me the wrong way, because Chi-yeol put it into Jae-woo's head that the fact that he was feeling guilty for what he said to a woman must mean that he is romantically interested in her. And that just makes no sense? It's normal to feel guilty for intentionally or unintentionally hurting someone; it doesn't have to have some underlying cause born out of romantic love. But this is a k-drama, and Jae-woo is a man and Yeong-ju is a woman, so, yes, k-drama logic dictates that everything under the sun is motivated by romantic feelings!",

It's funny how everyone around Hae-i treats him like &gt;!her boyfriend!&lt; and she relies on him most of all, but she may still need time to accept it.\n\nStill not sure how I feel about the Jae-woo romance plot. It still feels forced. And not because of the autism, but how they wrote them coming together. It was done masterfully in Extraordinary Attorney Woo, but I had a hard time understanding Young-ju's motivations apart from being lonely.\n\nLooking forward to the finale.",

This is the crux of the whole story. &gt;!Mr Ji\u2019s mother ripped their family apart, and his trauma led him to harm so many people. Sun-jae\u2019s mum, Su-a\u2019s mum, and all the other parents following their lead are doing more harm to their kids than good. Will they not learn? Must it be up to the next generation to make changes? Sun-jae and Hae-e\u2019s scene in the park was beautiful. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to choose our parents. All we can do is try to become better people than them.\u201d. Yes, and you\u2019re well on your way!!&lt;\n\nSpeaking of &gt;!Sun-jae, I was worried his confession would end with a cheesy pairing off, but that cut to Geon-hu laughing his ass off had me in stitches haha. Great writing, Hae-e\u2019s got way more important things to worry about! The boys bonding is also super cute. It\u2019s cannon to me that the 4 kids will carry their healthy and supportive friendships into adulthood. Yup.!&lt;\n\nWas anyone else &gt;!terrified while CCY investigated Mr Ji\u2019s sanctum of shame?! I was surprised by his demise today, but satisfied with how the plot line wrapped up. We didn\u2019t need (or have time for) a drawn out trial and punishment, or redemption arc. Mr Ji gave us conflict and suspense, but how his story ends only matters from our main character\u2019s perspectives. At least CCY knows the truth, the family is safe, and they can all start moving on.!&lt;\n\nHae-e\u2019s &gt;!supposed plan to live with bio mum is surely only a ploy to scare her off? I guess there had to be some conflict in the last episode, and actually I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s not between our!&lt; FL and ML. Their relationship has been so refreshing to watch. They communicate well, respect each other\u2019s space, and know how to support one another. No insecurity, no games. Just two people who are complete opposites, complementing each other perfectly \ud83d\udc95\n\nLast thing. &gt;!Fisticuffs with a serial killer was not how I envisioned JKH\u2019s return to the corridors of Yulje haha.. did anyone see the (unreliable) article about JKH this week casually mentioning an upcoming return in hosplay s3? I\u2019m sure they misspoke because there has been no hint of s3 actually happening, but my heart fluttered for a second!!&lt;",

Now that\u2019s all wrapped, people say if was anticlimactic and it should had taken longer to resolve! \n\nIt was obvious to me that the murder plot was just an element of the melodrama, nothing more. It gave jeopardy, turmoil, a bit of conflict between our leads and an illustration of the monsters this flawed pressurising parenting can engender. There was mystery and a few red herrings, but that was not the meat and potatoes of this drama. This drama is about parents and their children, and about 2 opposites, the aging versions of an school nerd and of a school athlete, coming together in a cut throat academic world with skewed priorities and zero interest in well-being.\n\nThe theme of parenting continues with Hae-i going to Japan with her real mum. This is the final test for our FL now that the ML has gone through his own test. I think Hae-i wishes closure with her real mum and that will put a strain in the FL cosy family unit.",

I was thinking until the very last moment, even while he was standing at the edge of the roof, that he'll turn himself in and serve life sentence or something. Though same difference for Chi-yeol at the end of the day, I suppose \u2013 in a way he had lost Mr. Ji the moment he realized the truth about him. Chi-yeol looked so heartbroken in the roof scene, and I felt so sorry for him having to witness Mr. Ji jumping to death right in front of his eyes.          \n\nHae-yi's biological mom is all kinds of annoying. Hae-yi saying she wants to move to Japan with her mom came as a shocker, but I get the feeling that she's doing it to get her mom away from Haeng-seon, Jae-woo, and Chi-yeol, and not because she's actually keen on leaving her aunt and uncle and her friends and start life anew in some foreign country with someone she's not even fond of. Her decision seems to have come in light of what Sun-jae told her: We can't choose our parents, but we can choose to be better people than them. From her perspective, keeping her mom around and letting her be a nuisance to the people she loves would be selfish of her, so she's doing what she thinks would be best for her family. Maybe a part of her also feels guilty for being a burden on Haeng-seon all this time and wants to fix that by letting Haeng-seon live her newfound life with Chi-yeol freely instead of taking care of and worrying over someone who's technically not even her responsibility.         \n\nAnd it's not even a first for Hae-yi. Remember how she confessed on an influencer's live broadcast about her true relationship with Haeng-seon for the sake of Haeng-seon's happiness even though she was scared about how people might react because of her past trauma at middle school? I think this situation is the same.     \n\nIt looks like the preview is hinting that &gt;!seeing Hae-yi miserable will prick the bio mom's conscience and make her realize how much Haeng-seon means to Hae-yi and vice versa.!&lt; The preview also shows &gt;!Haeng-seon reading a note/letter and sobbing.!&lt; My prediction is that &gt;!it's from her sister who has decided to see herself out and not take Hae-yi away from Haeng-seon and is apologizing and promising to be better and support them from afar in whatever way she can.!&lt;",

It was so freaking irrelevant at this point.\n\n\\-- the title of this show was sadly misleading. they didnt have to label it a romcom, it was an injustice to it because the show is great even despite not being a conventional romcom that they marketed it as. the original title of one shot scandal was much much more apt for it.\n\n\\-- NHS normally always stands up for herself and whats right, tad bit annoyed for her to just lie down and accept this incredibly shitty treatment by the &gt;!older sister who has showed up out of nowhere. Its her job as the mom also to make sure this burden doesnt fall onto Nam Hae e to keep her mom in line when she repeatedly embarrasses her infront of CCY. Nam Hae e shouldnt be the one having to worry about what her moms scheming upto this again shouldve been a conversation between the adults. Just made me feel like NHS's character became a tad unrealistic in order to portray her to be such a patient/saint like person that you have no anger/emotional reaction to the woman because of whom you had to give up your career and life to raise her child while burying your mother alone and grieving her too. This woman who didnt attend her own (NHS's mom too) mothers funeral is suddenly back and all you have to say is fine take my room ill sleep on the couch??!&lt; Are you for real?",

Hae-e was waking up and would ID him, CCY had found him out and the police had uncovered everything.  I didn't especially want to see a long drawn-out court scene, followed by a sentence.  Instead, we got an emotional moment on the roof where both actors got to act their asses off.  It was fitting.",

It highlighted the tragedy and love of his life ( &gt;! specially the scene between him and his sister in the dying moment really touched me !&lt; , yet did not glorify his actions. Also , I am glad that &gt;!there was no trial!&lt; . It would have  kept CCY in brutal public limelight and bring back bad memories for CCY. \n\nNam Hae-yi . The girl she is . She knows the truth about her bio-mom now. I think her &gt;!announcement to go to Japan with her Bio-mom!&lt; is just a ploy to throw off her bio-mom. Ofc, the bio-mom is not here to take parental responsibility. By announcing &gt;!that she want to go to Japan!&lt; , she is calling out her bluff.",

That said did anyone else feel like the suicide trope was used a bit too much? \n\nEspecially the line \u201cif you steal his money I will kill myself.\u201d It made me so uncomfortable! She\u2019s using herself as a weapon! It\u2019s not a healthy way to draw boundaries and I think they should have shown that instead of dismissing it as a lost child. This kind of statement is very serious.\n\nThey just seem to be playing around with suicide a lot.",

I don't know if it's the Korean imperative to be respectful to your parents no matter what.\n\nMaybe this scene was to highlight just how little power children have in Korean society.  How they have to use suicide as a threat because they are not empowered to speak back to their parents.\n\nWe saw that a lot in the relationships for basically all of the kids in the drama.  Their parents didn't listen to them or ask them about their concerns.  Just imposed their will.  All the kids except for HS and Hae-e.  Maybe the point is to showcase a healthy relationship between a parent and a child, and the parent isn't even really the biological parent.",

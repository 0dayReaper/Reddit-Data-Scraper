You can really see the genuine love in his eyes during the drama. They dated for a while but unfortunately they broke up after he went to do his military enlistment.\n\nEdit: Found the article about it: https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/15039/throwback-the-reel-to-real-romance-of-queen-and-i-stars-yoo-in-na-and-ji-hyun-woo/photo?amp",

Han Ga In and Youn Jung Yung, Ji Sung and Lee Bo Young, Eugene and Ki Tae Young, Kim So Yeon and Lee Sang Woo, Cha In Pyo and Shin Aera from the 90s, Joo Sang Wook and Cha  Yeryun. No one really knows what happened to the DOTS couple. Their divorce was really a huge shock, even more than their marriage announcement. SHK found out about the divorce through SJK's lawyers' press release. Blood couple's divorce was very acrimonious with a lot of accusations being thrown around.",

Are they the standard to which every celebrity couple should measure up?\n\nBoth those couples appear to be with younger and possibly immature men, not really ready to marry.\n\nHaving a child is not something to be taken lightly because they\u2019re bringing a human being into the world. I hope Hyun Bin and Yejin discussed this before they got married. \n\nCouples do get married to raise a family and they both seem to have come from families with strong ties and from the interviews of them I\u2019ve read, they seem to have similar views on marriage and having families.\n\nAlso, the way both of them have approached their careers seem to be very level headed and not into gimmickry. So let\u2019s hope they turn out to belong to a number of those happily married celebrity couples like Rain-Kim Tae Hee, Lee Bo Young-Ji Sung, Won Bin-Lee Na Young, Lee Sang Woo-Kim So Yeon, etc.  These couples should be the standard and not Song-Song or the Blood Couple.\n\nHaving a baby is to be celebrated, not something to wish they end up like DoTS or Blood couple.  Maybe there\u2019s an underlying envy there\u2026",

His family owns and runs the King Group. He is then thrown into an inheritance war over the King Group. Gu Won is a smart, elegant, and chic young man, but he is not very good with dating. He is unable to resist a fake smile.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheon Sa Rang (Lim Yoona) has a bright personality, with a smiling face. She begins to work at the King Hotel, that was the backdrop for some of her happiest memories from her childhood. While working at the hotel, she faces various difficulties. She also grows as a person. Gu Won and Cheon Sa Rang meet and a romantic relationship develops.\n&gt;\n&gt;[Source](https://asianwiki.com/King_the_Land)",

I don\u2019t think it means anything in Korean (cmiiw), but it\u2019s the name of the VVIP business lounge in the King Hotel, which is where the characters work. Personally, I suspect it\u2019s a play on the word \u2018wonderland\u2019 since Junho's character is named Won, but Disneyland probably works too \ud83d\ude05",

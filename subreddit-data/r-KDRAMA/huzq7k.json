Also think main character guy treats main character girl really shitty. There are ways where the guy his older brother and the girl can all get along because the girl said she's okay with living with his older brother and taking care of him as well. The going back and forth is just getting tedious and using the older brother as a continual reason for why they cant work it out is dragging out way too long. I really like Kim Soo Hyun, but his character just really frustrates me. And as I said before I waited along time for him to come back from the army and be in a movie or a kdrama so just even more disappointed than I should be.",

I actually think the slow progression enhances the reality of the drama. Especially when reflecting on ones personal life struggles, which usually aren\u2019t resolved quickly and with time all wounds heal. But I appreciate the different perspective on the drama.",

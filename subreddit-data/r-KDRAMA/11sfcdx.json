            "comment": "The most recent drama I watched with forced cohabitation was **\"When the weather is fine\".** I wouldn't even call it forced, really, and it was only for a couple of episodes, but I got a real laugh out how how it happened &gt;!(her entire house froze because a water pipe burst in winter).!&lt;\n\n**Good things**: ML is very silent, shy, tall and handsome and in love with FL. He awkwardly tries to make her feel at home in his house and their scenes together are very cute.\n\n**Bad things:** the cohabitation ended after her house was fixed. :') . Regarding the drama, I think many will find it very slow. I think I dropped the drama twice at the first episode before picking it up again. It's a good drama when you feel like it. There were also some miscommunication scenes which I really really don't agree with.\n\n**Interesting things:** the most interesting thing in the drama (apart from the plot) was the beautiful scenery. And Lee Jaewook's character, bless him. It has a book reading club! Very cozy and nice. It also has some poetry and I liked the ending bits in every episode where we see the ML's blog entries. One other thing that really interested me was FL's aunt's history. Those older ladies could really ACT. That story was captivating and unexpected. Her aunt was a real character.\n\n**Fun fact:** the most unbelievable thing about the drama was how ML was a handsome, unmarried man in a small village - realistically he would have been married thrice and had a kid. but that's kdrama for you. hahah\n\n**Spotlight because:** I think the cohabitation was the turning point for the couple finally getting together. I recommend the drama to anyone who enjoys a slow burn drama set in a wintry village. I give it a 7.5/10.",

What lingers with me is the violence and the tragedy. I'm clearly in the minority on this though. Most people don't even mention it when they talk about this drama.",

            "comment": "**I Hear Your Voice** (2013) (Legal/Supernatural/Noona RomCom/Thriller): Mind-reading ML spends 10 years searching for FL to protect her from a killer she testified against in his father's murder trial; she's now a jaded public defender.\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The characters. No one is effortlessly good or irredeemably evil. Everyone gets a story that examines their motivations and allows them the chance to grow and change; even the villians. \n* The romance. If you like slow-burns with leads building a life together, tsundere!FLs/steadfast!MLs, healing from shared trauma, cohabitation, a protective ML with an equally protective FL and helplessly devoted longing, it's *chef's kiss*. \n* The script. Parallelism is used to great effect, both as a rhetorical and narrative device to explore the themes of justice, the cycle of revenge, personal vs professional integrity and the limits of the law from different vantage points. \n* The story. Unlike most legal dramas it doesn't involve chaebol/politcal corruption, infallible genius lawyers or an episodic case-of-the-week format. Instead it's an arching narrative about how the legal system fails to hear the people that it represents and several people in particular who have to live with the consequences.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The cinematography. It has a simple style and high frame rate that looks plain compared to recent Kdramas.\n* The pacing. It received a two-episode extension near the end due to high ratings, so the story stretches EP14-18.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* Fun Legal Fact: In South Korea, if a couple a) cohabits for non-financial reasons b) shares household/familial responsibilities and c) are in a committed relationship, they can be considered [de facto married](http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/De_facto_marriage). It doesn't have the same rights as a de jure marriage, but it does have similar protections. A recent appellate decision found some benefits of de facto marriage [extend to LGBTQ couples](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/02/22/south-korea-court-recognizes-equal-benefits-same-sex-couple) as well, but has yet to be brought before the Supreme Court for a final ruling.\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* The forced cohabitation trope is higher stakes than a contract relationship or circumstance of convenience: &gt;!ML gets arrested and FL lies about their relationship to sign as his guardian for his release, so he moves in to keep up the ruse (and protect her).!&lt; In the second half, there's a parallel where &gt;!FL moves in with ML for safety because her address is known to the killer while ML's isn't.!&lt; And it comes full circle in the end when &gt;!ML moves back in with FL just to be together.!&lt;",

            "comment": "**Smile, You (2009)**\n\n* **Good Things:** Lee Min-jung is at her most charismatic in an over-the-top comic role. Her facial expressions are just amazing. Jung Kyung-ho is great too, and they make a very likable couple. I\u2019m watching and enjoying Jung in **Crash Course in Romance** right now, so that made me think of this show, which is where I first encountered him.\n\n* **Bad Things:** In contrast to the young characters, the older characters are extremely annoying with their bickering and nagging. In the early episodes, Lee Min-jung\u2019s dad, played by Kang Suk-woo, is especially hateful and slimy. But as the show progresses, he improves, while Jung Kyung-ho\u2018s mom, played by Song Ok-suk, pulls ahead as the most annoying character in a show full of them. Her constant nagging, temper tantrums, and hypocrisy are so tiresome, that they, combined with the marathon length of the show, at 45 episodes of over an hour each, finally wore me out and forced me to drop the show at 40 episodes.\n\n* **Interesting Things:** This show expands the cohabitation premise by dramatizing not just a couple being forced to live together, but 2 entire extended families who hate each other living together in a cramped, modest house. Things were so crowded and intimate, 2 of the young actors, Jeon Hye-jin and Lee Chun-hee, fell in love on the set and got married in real life.\n\n* **Spotlight on Because:** As I suggested above, this show takes the basic premise and really cranks it up a notch - you\u2019ve got 2 whole families forced to live together, and the comedy is broader and more absurd, the cuteness is extra cute, the fights are more intense, the shouting and whining and nagging ajummas and ajusshis are louder and more obnoxious, and the length is drawn out to 45 episodes and probably well over 50 hours. The fact that I had invested so much time into this drama, watching 40 episodes, but gave up almost at the finish line really says something. I was utterly exhausted and couldn\u2019t watch another minute, even though I found the main couple to be really entertaining and lovable. (In fact, I was so traumatized by Song Ok-suk\u2019s character that I feel negative vibes every time I see her in other dramas.) So if that sounds like your kind of challenge, it might be worth a try. Otherwise, you\u2019re probably better off staying away.",

They were just so amusing to watch.. \n\nI kinda miss those easy to watch /simple family storyline dramas. Yes, the parents at certain times were annoying but I think it felt realistic (coming from someone who was raised in an Asian household).. I remember some things that Lee Minjung\u2019s parents did when they first moved in made my blood boil even as a kid. How can you have no shame?!",

But Lee and Jung were a great couple and fun to watch. And I liked that their relationship never wavered and never had any of those ridiculous cliched misunderstandings. I know those Asian parents are pretty realistic, having grown up with them myself, but they still really annoy me.",

            "comment": "**Oh! My Ladylord** (2021)\n\nEDIT: Forced cohabitation is because (mild spoiler, some of this info is in the description of the show) &gt;! ML lives in a house and can only write scripts for dramas in that house. His mother owns the house and sells it out from under him (for reasons that would be a further spoiler). FL is a top actress and buys the house, which was her former childhood home. She wants to star in the drama ML is writing but ML doesn\u2019t want to cast her. They agree to cohabitate: he gets the place to write he can\u2019t work without, and she gets the starring role in the drama in return. Romance ensues as they get to know one another in ways that would never have happened if they hadn\u2019t been forced to cohabitate. !&lt;\n\n**Good Things:** From the standpoint of production quality, it\u2019s excellent. The actors are all excellent; the set design is beautiful; the music is on point and enhances the drama and the feel of the series. Whoever found the house the ML and FL live in deserves a bonus because it\u2019s a beautiful house and helps the story. Things that happen to some of the characters are strongly foreshadowed early on so the heartbreak in the final episodes isn\u2019t a surprise though it is painful to watch. Lee Min Ki plays the sorta spectrum-y quirky character he does really well but also does a superb job expressing strong emotion, angst, and pain, something he\u2019s fallen a bit short of accomplishing in other roles. Nana is amazing in her FL role, and Kang Min Hyun brings an understated vulnerability to his role as the SML/third leg of the love triangle. The pacing of the episodes is consistent and good throughout; the ending takes about 3 episodes rather than the hasty wrap up in the final episode that sometimes happens. The enemies to lovers was handled pretty well and the love story was sweet but intense - very rewarding to watch. \n\n**Bad Things:** My issues are minimal except for the elephant in the room - this story is a heartbreaker. The description on Amazon Prime read like a slightly zany rom-com and that\u2019s *not* what this story is. The truck of doom can be seen from miles away and there\u2019s nothing to do but stand stupidly in the middle of the road waiting for it to crush your heart. HUGE SPOILER &gt;! An ethical conflict/inconsistency bothered me: the FL would likely have married the SML and been happy if she never met the ML, and probably could have gotten the starring role in his show if he\u2019d died when he was originally fated to die. Instead, the ML\u2019s supernatural father wanted his son to experience love before dying so he gave his son a couple extra months but caused the FL to divert from a path of lifelong happiness with the SML and instead get a few weeks with the ML followed by a lifetime of sadness and grief over losing him. Supernatural father was an asshole in my opinion. ML\u2019s mom also rekindled her first crush old flame in full knowledge that she had only weeks/months to live and didn\u2019t tell him she was sick, thus stealing his informed choice about opening his heart. !&lt; There was an attempt to portray some of the reality of dementia, unless it was inconvenient for the plot; that was lazy writing and could have been handled better. \n\n**Interesting Things:** The parent generation characters are better developed as full human beings than is often seen. They have loves and regrets and don\u2019t spend 100% of their waking moments contemplating their adult children. The houses in the traditional neighborhood were amazing and it\u2019s a style of housing not usually depicted in dramas. \n\n**Spotlight On Because** There are some really well written scenes in this series, enough so that it\u2019s worth highlighting. &gt;! There is a conversation between ML and his mother where she\u2019s talking about dying and he\u2019s responding by telling her some of his feelings about his own upcoming death but she doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s talking about his own death rather than hers. They are conversing in parallel but in different dimensions and it\u2019s so poignant. !&lt; \n\nI finished this series days ago but I\u2019m still thinking about it. There is so much that felt deeply meaningful that I know I\u2019ll rewatch it at some point just to find some of those scenes again. It\u2019s ironic, because if I\u2019d known going in that it was a heartbreaker I never would have watched it because that\u2019s not my genre at all. This show is worth a watch but I a knowledge it\u2019s not for everyone.",

Not to mention, Lee Soo Hyuk, Kang Tae Oh, Shin Do Hyun. Visuals overload. Also the cinematography and character styling was great. I also really liked the premise and found it quite thought provoking. Kiss scenes are so pretty too  \n\n**Bad Things:** Not personally for me but a lot of viewers found the rules confusing. Also, the secondary pairing is a hit or miss (hit because everyone was damn attractive but miss because I cared more for the main couple tbh). Oh and there was a part with a foreign actor who just felt out of place as some foreign actors do in kdramas. Not the worst but also kinda weird. Oh and the polarising &gt;!amnesia!&lt; plot. Personally I didn\u2019t mind it but I know some people hate that trope. \n\n**Interesting Things:** The premise was interesting to me and not the drama, but I found the behind the scenes clips of the drama so damn fun because the leads are so bubbly irl. Both PBY and SIG have worked with the same directors on different dramas and he has cameo\u2019d in a lot of her dramas (Abyss, Oh My Ghostess) but this is their first time pairing and their chemistry is sooo good. \n\n**Spotlight on Because:** I loved seeing the contrast between the two leads\u2019 houses. One was cosy and colourful while the other is so aesthetic but dark and minimalist. Also because their cohabitation had some really cute or squealworthy scenes. I can\u2019t decide which one I want (both!) so it\u2019s nice how they had the best of both worlds haha.",

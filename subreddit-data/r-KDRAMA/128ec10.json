We already know that those who love Korean dramas are good people [through](https://i.imgur.com/GAuuKWD.png) and through, so that shouldn't be too hard. \n\nWe will [come back](https://i.imgur.com/c8x2SB6.png) to you with the results on the last day of Heirs Appreciation Week.  I hope that the professional statisticians on this sub can [help me](https://i.imgur.com/LkY5am4.png) with the p number and the [standard deviation](https://i.imgur.com/Gmwul2E.png) and other complicated but importantissimo subjects. \n\nThis is the survey that will make you understand why [the world](https://i.imgur.com/k0iTnG7.png) is as it is. And the survey is \n\n[***HERE***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKzT2RBuOIcdLbK5YyXdF40yiu_70PHAh3Golhg70IvBx0uw/viewform)\n--------------------\n\nAll the screenshots are from Heirs except one, and that one is from the Chinese drama **Why Women Love** (A TRAITOR HAS WRITTEN THIS POST! PLEASE DO NOT [REPORT](https://i.imgur.com/4CQ3zMk.png) HER TO THE MODS!)",

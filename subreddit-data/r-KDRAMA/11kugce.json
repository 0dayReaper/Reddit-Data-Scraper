I think he was just being a idiot, typical young chap trying to seem funny but isn't, brain not fully developed..unfortunately way too many of them around these days. He said he hates anyone who looks pathetic, like Sung Joon who is his best friend, that's definitely a joke. I just think he was very young and it was a very stupid thing to do, plus he was in the modeling industry which sounds like a horrible place to be, he probably had an inflated ego. No doubt he regretted it.",

He basically went on to say he only likes pretty people and what he considers to be ugly in women. \n\nIt would have been fine if it was one off but he had like 2-3 interviews with such statements.\n\nI'm sure he regrets it now considering even his close friends found his judgement to be harsh.\n\nEdit: grammar.",

I thought agencies seemed very controlling in South Korea also, that he wasn't monitored by them or maybe he was trying to cause a reaction. Also the questioned he was asked we very silly. I hope he has found peace since then. He seems like a nice person in interviews but I think everything in kdrama world is fiction",

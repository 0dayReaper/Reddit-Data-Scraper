    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.  If you are using Markdown and not  Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way  to create spoiler tags is to use  &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without  spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

In this episode Lee Sung Min is the guest and they bond over living in Daegu and coming to Seoul to purchase their dreams. \nLee Sung Min also talks about the start of his career, why he became an actor, the reactions of his friends and family, and other interesting tidbits of information. It's really nice to watch.",

During their leisurely walks through the park on their way to their next door to each other homes in **The Time We Were Not In Love**. In **She Would Never Know**, if I remember correctly, there\u2019s even a closeup of their knees and feet moving in perfectly matching steps. In **I Hear Your Voice**, when they have a protective police presence in a car behind them &gt;!and finally the moment comes where she takes his hand in front of the police and any passerby!&lt;.\n\nEvery time it happens, I think warm and happy thoughts about this way of visually showing the meaning of \u201cstaying by the side\u201d of the person you love and with whom you\u2019re choosing to spend your life",

It was so cute seeing him and Park Shin Hye, Park Hyung Sik, Krystal, Kim Woo Bin and others in their younger years where they were all fresh faced and wide-eyed.\n\n**Call it Love** challenged me to finish it because of how melancholy much of it is but the ending (and I mean the very last scene) put a huge smile on my face and made me feel very warm and cozy.  Cinematography, writing, acting and the characters themselves were all excellent and if I have any complaints at all they are very minor (pink filter, why?), (k-drama time skip - bleh!) in comparison.\n\nStarted **Good, Bad Mother** and the first two episodes are interesting and hit pretty hard from an emotional point of view.  This show is going to be very good, I think!",

Talking about **Born Again** since I just watched it, I brought up the Star Trek franchise and revenge stories and justice, etc. Used as an example the movie *Star Trek Beyond*, which I really liked but hated the ending. One of my favorite characters was Jaylah, played by Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. I loved her character and had loved Ms. Boutella in *Kingsmen: The Secret Service* as the assassin with the steel bladed prosethetic legs.\n\n*Anyway,* when I was looking to randomly see what she was doing next, I saw a screen shot of her next to Steven Yeun for a movie called *Alpha Gang*. I clicked on that because damn I want to see that! Turns out it's in pre-production and also stars Nicholas Hoult, Jon Hamm, and others. So now I have a movie to look forward to!\n\nAll made possible by the wonderful people of this subreddit. *Gamsahamnida. I can't spell.*",

Used to be they were the hitmaker among the terrestrial channels (along with KBS and SBS) and they would churn out top rater after top rater almost every year. Now nearly all their shows are straight ratings flops. Imagine only 2 hit dramas in 2 years (Red Sleeve and Big Mouth)? Very uncharacteristic. These days SBS has been showing them up with stuff like Taxi Driver (on its second season), a THIRD season of Dr Romantic, Business Proposal, Our Beloved Summer, One Dollar Lawyer, Again My Life, The First Responders, and Payback. KBS too is doing well with its weekend dramas propping it up. \n\nPersonally I'll never forgive how they screwed up Kim Jung Hyun's comeback drama; I hope he gets to a point in his career where he no longer has to settle for a script that won't do his talent justice. I refuse to believe that the network had nothing to do with how poorly Season of Kokdu turned out. The headwriters' recent work Less Than Evil was warmly received and the director Baek Soo Chan is known for his string of solid hits like The Girl Who Sees Smells, Beautiful Gong Shim and Reunited Worlds which is a personal favorite of mine.\n\nAlso I don't get their morbid streak because nearly all their notable recent dramas have a major death or are about grim reapers lol.",

It seems like it from your comment but I haven't watched any of it.

                            "comment": "Not OP. \n\n**Kokdu** is his comeback drama but I guess personal tastes really differ as I absolutely loved it (in no small part because of what KJH did with the role that I almost think was written with him in mind). And when I say love, I mean the kind of love where I'd probably rank it in my top 5 fantasy kdramas of all time.\n\nIt's a very dialogue heavy drama in the sense that there is a lot of wordplay and references contained in the dialogue that invites peeling away of the layers -- which is what I guess to be one of the 'turn-off' factors for viewers, especially international ones. It's also very philosophical. For example, one question it explores again and again in different facets throughout the course of the story is can killing another person ever be justified -- including presenting the question 'is a death sentence for a criminal justifiable'?\n\nSo basically, it looks and was marketed as a fantasy romance but the writer basically wrote a whole philosophical treatise. As a romance/romcom, it's rather by the numbers. But for me, the dialogue and treatment of certain tropes is an insightful philosophical exercise where maybe there is no 'right' answer at the end of the journey but lots of food for thought.",

It doesn't lean quite as hard into the premise as those shows, but that's what it is. Odd to see in a kdrama.\n\nI have to admit I can kinda see why it was unpopular. First, the characters are almost universally unlikeable. Not villains, but just the average, annoying, self-absorbed types we've all had to work with. The exception is Kim Soo-hyun, playing way against type as a nebbishy, awkward rookie, but the show revels so much in his humiliation that it almost feels like we're supposed to sympathize with his oppressors -- unlike in *The Office*(s), where the real joke was always on Michael or David. The second, more serious problem is that it's just not that funny. Park Ji-eun must have been having some off days, or just straying too far from her wheelhouse, because normally I find her writing hilarious.\n\nI'll probably finish it; if nothing else, it's a fascinating window into what Koreans think of their own workplace culture (spoiler: it sucks), but I'm not loving it.",

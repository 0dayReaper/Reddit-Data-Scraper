I really hope nothing bad happens to her.\n\nAlso, Rembrary acting embarrassed for misunderstanding Dal loving him was so funny\n\nRembrary acting as slave was soooo over the top XD\n\nWhy did they use green screen for the spirit forest scene instead of filming it at real life location? The entire scene felt kind of jarring. Like it was done really fast and camera switching?\n\n[Episode 8]\n\nSo glad that the Hell faction is finally doing something. Was worried that with so many factions in this show, their spotlight and purpose would be vague and diminished. Fortunately, they didn't go down that path.\n\nThe Black Magic making Dal lazy and ditzy(?) was rather interesting. Glad to see that not all people's ugliest side is murder. Some of us just want to be a slob and laze around and eat all day y'know?\n\nGrim Reaper bragging about sensing the zero presence guy was so childish. Ancient beings acting childish never gets old haha. Also, omfg, Grim Reaper tried to go in for a group hug only to hug himself. Poor thing ;_;",

I first knew him from Because This Is My First Life and I found out that he is the main lead for The Heavenly Idol so I immediately started watching this drama for him. Now I'm simultaneously watching Business Proposal and his performance in that drama made my jaw drop. Their character personalities are so different that it made me think it was a different actor. He's genuinely so talented and his chemistry with the female leads just shines so naturally.\n\n**Thoughts on Episode 7:**\n\nRembrary beats Yeon Woo's ass any day. Him trying to comfort Dal and &gt;!giving her a stuffed toy when she found out that the emails sent to her were not written by Yeon Woo was so heartwarming.!&lt; Literally can't wait for them to get together \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI'm so happy that &gt;!Rembrary fixed Yeon Woo's relationship with Tae In.!&lt; I thought that the storyline would make the Evil One manipulate Tae In to further divide Rembrary and Tae In's friendship, but I'm so glad that they didn't go with this direction.\n\nI hope Dal doesn't succumb &gt;!to the Evil One's black magic.!&lt; I'm looking forward to how this plot unravels in Episode 8.\n\n**Thoughts on Episode 8:**\n\nCan anyone further explain why Dal blames herself for what happened to Liz Ri? I don't understand this situation, what did Dal do to &gt;!cause Liz Ri to take her own life?!&lt;\n\nThat &gt;!forehead kiss!&lt; at the end of this episode was EVERYTHING\n\nI can't wait for next week's episode. Based on the preview &gt;!it seems like someone took a picture of Dal and Rembrary or saw them together causing a rumor to spread!&lt; \n\nHow will Wild Animal win the Best Artist award? I don't see how they would wrap this up unless this plotline gets rushed",

I understand why a show with such an inherently silly premise like this would only get 12 eps, but I find myself wishing for more and more hijinks. Love how each week brings Rembrary closer and closer to his fellow members, especially those that were hurt my Woo Yeon Woo\u2019s past behavior.\n\nAs far as heros of fantasy dramas go, I find our Blueberry to be so refreshing and surprisingly even more entertaining than the slew of morally questionable antiheros that have cropped up as of late (Hwayugi, Doom at You Service, Kokdu- to name a few examples).\n\nUnlike some, I\u2019m really shipping the leads, though I definitely think they could have benefited from more episodes to develop their relationship. Still I coudn\u2019t help but ship them ever since he started to fluster her in eps 3-4. They already had good chemistry before he even showed any awareness of her.\n\nI also find the way they\u2019re amping up their relationship to be quite entertaining. Ep 7 really brought it home on imbuing humor into how he grapples with their relationship. &gt;!I expected that her words at the end of last week\u2019s eps would have him much more flustered than her and I was right. While obviously saying those words definitely hints at some budding feelings on her end, she has yet to realize or accept her feelings. So it was hilarious to see Rembrary go through the phase of denying their relationship, all while projecting all these feelings unto her.!&lt;\n\nShe still had a strong bond with WYW so it will be interesting to see how her budding feelings for Rem affect her resolve to bring him back. &gt;!Glad Dal came to realize he is not quite who she has idolized all this time \u2014 even if it\u2019s disappointing for her.!&lt; WYW was something that helped her live all this while, but like training wheels, she can\u2019t depend on him forever and will need to face the root of her depression. I hate the Evil one, but I have a feeling he\u2019ll force her to do so.\n\nI\u2019m pretty conflicted on WYW coming back or not. Given that some of the focus is on idols losing their way and what not, I want to give him a chance to be better, but the show has to create an opportunity for him to prove himself and doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to do so. I understand it\u2019s unlikely the drama would let Rembrary stay, but I\u2019m concerned about not feeling like WYW deserves to enjoy the fruits of someone else\u2019s labor. At this point, I just want to spend as much time on Rembrary\u2019s antics as possible.",

Even the evil one was confused lol.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also like how Rembrary has no regards for the dislike of the sunbae actor guy. The sunbae must be so annoyed thinking \"no not this guy again!\".!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Him stabbing Rakin with his little sword while yelling go away vegan goblin definitely gave me a good laugh.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!The whole group coming together and being worried about Han Gyeol was also quite sweet, although I do feel bad for his date who basically just ended up in some idol group drama. Seems like she did not mind though.!&lt;\n\nI am looking forward to the next episodes.

Not only do the actors play it off with perfection, there are certain character/plot choices that writer made that worked really well. The premise is so light-hearted, for example, but the show often cuts to the heart of depression and suicidal thoughts. Especially with Dal...to see her struggle with that while being a proven smart, capable person...it meant a lot to me. And then to see Rembrary's compassion and tenderness towards her....it was SO WELL DONE.\n\nI also love how every episode gives us more reasons to hate WYW. He's such a terrible guy lmfao\n\nKim Min Kyu is a force of nature. I didn't use to like him (for no reason, really)...he was in the bg of a lot of dramas I'd watched. But his performance in Snowdrop, and then coupled with his rising popularity after Business Proposal...I'm such a fan. He's such an amazing actor, and his sheer *range* is incredible.

So I fully think the two of them will bring the chemistry when it goes into romance mode. Even in these two episodes, I think Rembrary is in denial of his feelings, and wanting to confuse it for his priestly duty. I think the bigger challenge will be to resolve the plots for anything close to a happy ending \ud83d\ude2d",

I wouldn't say it gets better each episode, but it still keep my Thursday entertained, and at this point, I am just enjoying the ride and nonsense they throw at me, haha. Imo, the key thing in watching this drama is to watch for the laugh and Rembrary antic.\n\nIn terms of plot and the whole drama itself, it is all over the place, and I feel like they couldn't stick to just one genre, and they try to do everything at once / also leaving out stuff and expect us to understand what's going on. The editing feels a bit messy and very noticeable as you go.",

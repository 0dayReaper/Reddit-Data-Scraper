This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

The case happened at the convenience store and the child saw the shoe of the murderer. He ends up in the police station and doesn\u2019t want to talk. The child ends up saying that the murderer is one of the members of the police.",

What I mean is that in EP. 9, right at the end when BYJ first tells HeeDo that it's love, he doesn't need rainbow (scene on the bridge), the music starts with few vocals (not words), and I absolutely love it, it feels like it is part of the above OST I mentioned, but it is not there in the original soundtrack when I search it on Youtube etc. Can anyone please let me know if one containing that part exists outside of the show, or simply is there longer than normally seen version of the above OST. Thank you.",

I feel like I may be mixing two shows together but someone please let me know if they can recognize it. \nSo I remember in one of the first episodes the female lead was being walked home by the male lead(?)  (I think she played a detective) and it was raining and she went inside and he left. She ended up being killed in her home and for some reason the male lead came back, I think he may have forgot something of hers or wanted to tell her something but he knocked on the door and she didn\u2019t answer so he felt like something was wrong. They police came and found her. She was in the show still I think playing as a ghost and trying to solve her murder alongside the male lead.  (Spoiler!!) \n&gt;! I think her ex who was a prosecutor and was the one who ended up killing her !&lt; Please does anyone know this show?!!!",

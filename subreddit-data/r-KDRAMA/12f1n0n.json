(We all don't need cranky mods, now do we) \n\n[Legal Streamin Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas/)\n\nEvery once in awhile articles like this are published about the business side of Kdrama's.  I found this one to be more informative than usual and brings the business side of Kdrama's up-to-date. Some may find it interesting.\n\nBesides, any article that mentions the lamented Dramafever web site can't be all bad. For those that don't know,  Dramafever was fantastic go-to for old and new series that became a casualty of Corporate America's tone deaf, short sighted-money-pig-sty-of-a-mentality that couldn't recognize a trend if it was sitting on it. Which it literally did. :(",

Links are hard to come by now, but here's one from [2013](https://www.hancinema.net/dramafever-set-to-premiere-first-original-co-production-the-heirs-61317.html) announcing the production and one from [2015](https://www.techinasia.com/dramafever-post-acquisition) that also talks about their motivations for co-producing.\n\nThe CEO, President and Vice President of Dramafever were Korean and interested in bringing Korean media/culture to a larger international audience (they won the South Korean Ministry of Culture commendation for [Korean Business of the Year](https://web.archive.org/web/20101224125348/https://www.korean-content.com/2010/12/14/6th-annual-dari-awards-celebrate-those-who-help-korean-content-come-to-the-usa/) in 2010), and they were the first streaming site to have legitimate deals with all the major Korean networks. \n\nWB did Dramafever dirty, but they were also victims of their own success. As Kdramas got more and more popular, licensing rights became more and more expensive. In 2016 SBS/KBS/MBC created their own content channel with Kocowa - which meant Dramafever lost their exclusivity with those networks - and Netflix / Viki / Amazon could easily outbid them for re-distribution rights. They were sold to WB mid-2016 and shuttered in 2018 [because they never turned a profit](https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/dramafever-casualty-big-money-ott-war/).",

I was literally in the middle of an episode when it started buffering; I assumed it was my internet connection so I backed out of the app and reconnected to wifi. The app was still buggy so I gave up and went to bed. The next day I tried going to the website instead and got the splash page.\n\nI still miss Drama Fever. Its interface was the best; it was easy to navigate and find new dramas to watch by genre, and it siloed my kdrama fix from my western shows. Viki is still annoying as heck to me for various reasons, and as much as I appreciate the volume of content and the coordinated release of episodes internationally, my Netflix algorithm was forever skewed to Asian content once that partnership happened. And the subs aren't as good as DF's were. (There are times i.suspect something's missing in translations of text on screen, or that I'm missing a play on words or cultural reference that would be helped by a different translation or an editor's note. I wind up pausing to take a photo of the TV and run it through a translator app, or Google for more context. I don't remember feeling the need to do that on DF.)",

I got started with dramas in general via Japan, but once I got into Korean dramas ten years ago, it\u2019s been nearly impossible for me to switch back-and I\u2019m speaking as someone who lived there for five years (mid-oughts) and is very used to the language/culture. It just seems that every time I dip my toe back in, it seems lacking. I say all that and yet I just watched Netflix\u2019s \u201cFrom Me to You\u201d, and did find *that* quality to be very similar to k-dramas. Are there a good number of recent dramas with similar quality? Anything in the last decade, at least? I\u2019m pretty familiar with Japanese dramas from before then.",

I dunno, I was literally asking a friend about this the other day\u2026was I wrong about the general quality of Japanese dramas in the last decade? In her opinion, no. I think it just depends when you picked up or stopped watching. The Japanese dramas of the 2000\u2019s seem pretty similar to Korean dramas I\u2019ve seen from the same time period. I picked up Korean dramas in 2012\u2026they consistently improved and I feel Japanese dramas just stayed stagnant. A good portion of those you mentioned have been from 2020 or are more recent; not that I won\u2019t take the suggestion, but it seems more like they\u2019ve much more recently improved. Which is great, I\u2019m really happy to go back to them, but my yardstick is still Korean dramas by a long shot.",

Even if I was exaggerating a bit and broadly speaking from my personal experience, people like my friends and I who fall into the kdrama to jdrama pipeline, they generally become jmedia fans first and kdrama fans second if at all. Obviously, that's not gonna be applicable to everyone. \n\nBut as for what you were saying about the past decade of jdramas staying stagnant while kdramas improved... Most jdrama fans I've run into say the opposite, in fact they prefer the past decade's content to more recent ones \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. There are as many opinions about this as there are people.\n\n I just like the jdramas I like, no matter what year they came from. I've found that though Japan also have a set number of tropes and character archetypes they always use, every so often we get some insane storylines and innovative plots that would never come from SK or Chinese dramaland.\n\nAlthough sometimes I'll watch a jdrama and wish the writers hadn't been this innovative &amp; let their script stay in the drafts \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80",

They are the biggest budget and tell interesting stories about Japanese history in a deep dive format. It's not 1:1 in that they introduce new characters or arcs in actual historical stories.\n\nThey run 1 episode a week, for a year so it's a commitment but is always seen as the premier drama of the year. I will say they're a little dry and takes some getting used to compared to the high octane Kdramas.",

            "comment": "So, I didn't much like this sentence: *\"For years, the South Korean TV industry had been ruled by a handful of local networks that churned out popular, formulaic romance dramas \u2014 typically, love stories revolving around topsy-turvy, star-crossed courtships \u2014  while the more prestigious storytelling often landed in movie theaters.\"*\n\nApart from the \"more prestigious\", that is true of course. \n\nMany of the romance dramas were inventive. The oldest drama mentioned is **Goblin**, which for sure had a higher camera budget, but isn't for example **My Love from the Stars** very inventive, \"despite\" being a romance drama? What is wrong with romance dramas?\n\nThe men who have such contempt for romance should think about it again: It is about women who dream about men. Shouldn't they be glad the women want them?",

            "comment": "I mean the versatility of the actors and actresses are insane. Like take IU, in Hollywood she would be typecasted, but in k dramas her range is insane. Can't even think of a Hollywood star that can remotely compare to her on level if talent\n\nMaybe Im biased but take the top Hollywood actor and compare them with the mid k dramas actor.. Koreans smoke them.\n\nEven as a star wars fan, I've never been so bored over the franchise. But my backlog of k dramas just keep growing.",

Some people sued because they\u2019d just bought yearly subscriptions &amp; weren\u2019t getting their money back.  What a stupid corporate decision \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2c\nI was in the middle of 100 Days My Prince too, &amp; I also have some DF tees that I got at the 2016 KCon NY cause DF sponsored it \ud83e\udd17",

They are in it enough to move the story along, but they don't have that much screentime.\n* Love how they turned WJ's mom around in these episodes. She seemed really scary in ep 10. Would love to hear some more of her backstory - the earlier episodes made it seem like she was in urgent care somewhere but she seems fine now?\n* Also love Jun but man &gt;!him walking away after Haesung confessed!&lt; was brutal. I still don't quite get him - are there still some lingering feelings for Woojoo? When he &gt;!hovered over her phone number!&lt; I wasn't sure if he was thinking about her romantically or just missing his friend.\n* The strap of Dongjin's backpack is getting worse by the minute. The company is doing better now so someone please get him a new one!\n\nOnly two more weeks with our favourite emo couple! They better not break our hearts...",

I think he clings to them so desperately out of that loneliness but is afraid of venturing into uncertain territory, like that of a romantic relationship, where if things go south, he could lose the only three people he has in his life. He is just deeply afraid of loss \ud83e\udd79. That little speech he made about how he is so afraid of being uncomfortable and how he believes he is just like his dad is a small but significant insight of the way he thinks. I'm starting to understand him more.!&lt; Also I just want one kdrama where they recognise that men and women can just be friends so it'll be nice if they just leave their relationship as platonic.",

            "comment": "Editing to add: anyone else notice how Woojo is sort of handling this how one in a torrid love affair would? It\u2019s very parallel to her father\u2019s infidelity - saying she will tell the person she loves the truth, hiding things from everyone that you care about and that might be hurt by this because of your passion. Her saying that she will get to telling ML the truth, begging his friend for more time to reveal the truth herself to the ML. What smart writing. \n\nSo the chemistry is WOW - I replayed that &gt;!kiss and bed scene!&lt; like 29 times, I am not even gonna lieeeee. I\u2019m in love with the ML. So gentle yet\u2026his passion and love for her is so obvious. He\u2019s laying it all out, opening his heart fully to her.\n\nWhen he finds out the truth, I am just going to be heartbroken \ud83d\udc94 I was really frustrated with FL at first and her prolonging the inevitable, but I feel sorry for her now. I had so much anxiety these two episodes that she was going to be found out and was yelling at my tv for her to just come clean! The actress is doing SUCH a good job sharing that anxiety with the viewers lol.\n\nShe really was dealt by life with so many shitty cards due to her father\u2019s infidelity, and I think because of the trauma and environment she was raised in she was never able to fully express her opinion or be open about anything. She can speak about what\u2019s on her mind about other things and people. But you can see her and her siblings struggle with being open and honest with each other - they instead choose to pretend to not notice things. So I can see why this is difficult for her. \n\nAnd she also knows how incredibly hurt but also sorry ML will be - he will no way want to be involved with her after what his mother did to her and her family. I really hope they can find a way to make this work, although the circumstances are very difficult.\n\nI suspect FL\u2019s mom knows who he is. A mother always knows\u2026when she asked FL at the end of episode 12 if she is hiding anything else, after hearing her daughter speak so kindly of the mistress\u2019 gentle son - she confirmed what she suspected the minute she met DJ. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into this, but if you go back to episode 11 where the mom meets him for the first time the way she looks at him is almost as if she recognizes him. Does anyone know if DJ lived with his mom the years that Woojo\u2019s dad left the family for his mother? I imagine Woojo\u2019s mom would\u2019ve known or had met her friend\u2019s son at some point? The actress playing the mother is doing a great job, so I swear I saw a look of recognition in her eyes when she first set her gaze on him. And like her kids, instead of asking her daughter or telling her she suspects he\u2019s the son, she\u2019s kept it to herself/ignored it? Idk. It does seem like a stretch that she wouldn\u2019t confront her daughter about something that major\u2026\n\nThe second lead couple that\u2019s being created with Jun and Haesung - I like them together. Jun is so afraid of losing the only family he knows, Woojo and her siblings. I totally get why he would hesitate. I do think he has feelings for Haesung but thinks it\u2019s safer to just remain friends and he continues working out of his little box pharmacy. I also understand his fear that she is flaky and has been in her past relationships/has crushes easily. So he\u2019s very afraid of getting hurt and then he loses his family. Him leaving her like that when she &gt;!confessed though!&lt; SENT ME \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I shouldn\u2019t have laughed that hard, but I might be in the minority that I actually think while it\u2019s rude he did that and he should apologize, it\u2019s kind of great Haesung has time to actually sit with these newfound feelings for her sister\u2019s friend and be rejected for once. \ud83d\ude4a\n\nGotta say, I\u2019m still mad this drama was lost in the Disney+ ether\u2026easily the best drama airing right now. I know it\u2019s on Hulu but wish it would\u2019ve been on Netflix or Viki to get more viewers.",

Love when a drama delivers exactly what it promises :)\n\nSome thoughts on hyeseong \u00d7 jun: &gt;!damn, it was hard to watch the scene where he just walks away. It reminded me of that time when woojoo told him about her feelings and he left her at the bar in the exact same way - without a word. It's a pattern and I love that the drama foreshadowed this a long time ago.  I wasn't surprised when he rebuffed her confession - I was hurt yes, but also it made sense, considering he has never shown any romantic interest thus afar. It would be weird if he suddenly confessed too. I also liked how he was introspective, made connections with his dad and apologised in ep12. We love a self aware king.!&lt;\n\nIm not sure what direction their relationship is gonna go now but I'm still hoping they are end game. Though my prediction is that nothing is gonna happen until the absolutely last episode. Also, I'm sensing a time skip which I'm never a fan of. \ud83d\ude2d on another note, I'm glad hyeseong &gt;!broke up with her young bf because I'm team Jun all the way, but damn he was spitting facts!&lt; - she really is afraid of conflict and is always putting on a fake smile, no doubt a defense mechanism she has picked up due to the past trauma from her dad's affair. You can also see the same dynamic play out in the strained relationship she has with her siblings and how they are all so distanced from each other, never really talking about things long enough for them to fight about it.",

She knows her friend so well, gives her sound advice, is the right amount of pushy and also so protective. Haesung is really blessed to be surrounded by good people. Even Suho whilst misguided in so casually revealing something about her to his friend showed immense amount of maturity for his age. The offer to &gt;!practice arguing!&lt; was so sweet because you know he realizes she\u2019s a good person and although not right for him deserves to confront her shortcomings and learn from them on her quest for happiness. I wouldn\u2019t have expected that from someone young and I actually really appreciate that the writers haven\u2019t written him to be unidimensional. It\u2019s often not the case and that too with a minor role character. \n\nDongjin\u2019s subtle changes while so thrilling to see because he really does deserve to happy and excited, can\u2019t help but make you want to also shake him a little and tell him to stop and ask more of Woo Joo. I know that what they love about each other is just that\u2026giving space and comfort to talk when the other feels like but he needs to up the ante next week. I did however love that he was straightforward with &gt;!Minyoung and openly voiced his desire!&lt;. He\u2019s so accommodating that he rarely voices what he wants and I think he\u2019s finding the new found freedom from his shackles of the past to be liberating and filling him with confidence. His conversation with &gt;!her mother in Ep 11 was so heartwarming and real. It really drove home the why point behind their attraction to each other!&lt;, it\u2019s just terribly ironic that despite stating this now he\u2019s going to experience hurt anyway. \n\nHowever, I think for exactly this reason he is not going to be the one that cannot get past their sordid connection. It is definitely going to be Woo Joo. He seems to have reached a place of acceptance and comfort with himself, his life and what he desires out of his relationship and I think that may prove to be his strength through the rough times ahead. \n\nSwitching to Woo Joo\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say. This poor girl has had expectations be thrust on her at such a young age that she is now so sold into being the &gt;!pillar of her family and the universe that holds the comet and planet in orbit!&lt; that she is mentally and physically incapable of putting thought into what she wants out of life. Stealing those moments with Dongjin while may seem selfish, and they are, was also so sad to see. To have to justify to yourself your wish to act upon your feelings because it\u2019s your &gt;!birthday!&lt; and you\u2019d like it to be nice, nearly broke my heart. She\u2019s confused, scared, hurt, in love and she just doesn\u2019t know how to communicate or process. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to watch as the audience because you know she\u2019s capable of not beating around the bush, and that is how you know he\u2019s become her \u201cweakness\u201d. It was heartbreaking watching her on the brink of tears almost throughout episode 12 whether it was towards Sun Woo or Dongjin or her mother. I admire her (misguided) resolve to reserve the actual full story and truth for Dongjin but she needs a little push and kick in the bum and I hope she gets that next episode. I would love for once for such types of major plot points to be an actual conversation between the leads where we can then see the fall out thereafter rather than have an inadvertent spillage and the associated rage of not being told directly coupled with the inherent hurt that will follow. \n\nDespite her flaws I love the way Haesung handled Jun. He is an extremely introverted person with commitment issues and is riddled with fear and anxiety over his routine being broken\u2026yet it is for these exact reasons I think the two of them are a great fit. He may say Woo Joo is his best friend but I think he really values all 3 of them equally and unwittingly cares a tad more for Haesung. I hope they find their way eventually. \n\nI really hope to god we don\u2019t eventually get an open ending for the leads because to be honest they\u2019re the kind who would want resolution one way or the other. I also like to believe that subtle things DJ said and did over this week indicate that this time he\u2019ll be willing to fight and wait as needed. Please Woo Joo don\u2019t be harsh on yourself and put yourself first for once\u2026\ud83d\udc9c\n\nETA: One scene I really enjoyed because it so beautifully displayed the dynamics of the 4 roomies is when they all gather at the playground. There was such warmth even though they all kinda bickered a bit. \n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking over Woo Joo &gt;!breaking down in front of her mother!&lt;. \n\nI think honestly my only wish from the remaining 4 episodes is for Woo Joo to receive the biggest warmest hug from Dong Jin where she has one big cry. At the very least she deserves that.",

The whole family dynamic is so good and well thought of.\n\nNone of the Shims are dumb, they all pick up clues quickly. Even the happy go lucky Jigu figured out where he saw Dongjin\u2019s mom. \n\nWoojoo\u2019s internal conflict is so well portrayed. \n\nOn the flip side, Dongjin looked so happy to be accepted into the family as Woojoo\u2019s boyfriend. Little does he know what\u2019s coming. \n\n\u201cWhat do you like about my cold daughter?\u201d Woojoo\u2019s mom has quickly become a favorite like her children.\n\nThe director is showing off with some of the scenes. How beautiful was it to see Dongjin eating breakfast and then seeing Woojoo enter the frame showing her making the breakfast. Same with Minyoung and Heeja. This show needs an award for cinematography.\n\nLastly, big props to Lee Sung Kyung, she has learnt to say a thousand words with the faintest of movements. The very tiny nod in episode 11 spoke volumes. Superb growth as an actor. I hope she wins many awards for this performance.\n\nThe economy of movement and yet speaking volumes is fantastic.\n\nEdited to add: Depending on the way this show ends, I will definitely add the director and writer(s) to my list and follow their careers. The pink filter crew has made an amazing show.",

After staying up till 2am last night, I had multiple early morning Zooms.\n\nThese last 2 episodes knocked it out of the park bringing the romance from 10 to 100 very quickly. I had high expectations for these two since their previous kissing scenes in other dramas were steamy, but in addition, the writing was so intense! I didn't expect a &gt;!first kiss &gt; sleep together!&lt; combo.\n\nWoojoo in her characteristic impulsive way is jumping all in, but really needs to talk to Dongjin as the walls of her lies are closing in around her very quickly. As she said, if she's the one to explain &gt;!he will be less hurt,!&lt; I don't really know how the long-term viability of the relationship could be resolved, though...I mean, either his mom dies or goes to jail. That woman will not back down. Yet, Woojoo is actually the only person who can help him disentangle himself from her.\n\nI get Jun. He's a nerdy misanthrope who has found a balance with the 3 siblings and dating Hye Song would mess everything up. I get a sense he wants to...but it's way too risky because he's only seen her in a string of shallow messed up relationships.\n\nThe writing and acting for all these characters is just so good!\n\nPS: It took me a while to put 2 and 2 together, but the actor playing Jun is also Gungtan, the main antagonist in Island and now I can't unsee it. I'm amazed at how good he is, because he took me several episodes to figure out it was even the same person.",

However, I do wish she'd tell WJ that it's ok to date him regardless of who his mother is. It's just a horror thing to have your husband's mistress as your in-law. Though I don't usually like the big white truck of doom, I do wish the Heeja can get hit by it so that the problem about her is solved and also a big weight off DJ's shoulder. You know how sometimes parents are too much a burden to their kid's life that it would help the kid so much more to not have the parent around.",

I watched him in the movie On Your Wedding Day (highly recommended), where he depicted the ML's transition from an average foolish teenboy to a similarly average and clueless young man.\n\nIn this drama, he's a dependable, depressed, and quiet man. He really embodies the character from the way he walks, or like Woojoo's mom said, the way he holds his chopsticks. I'd say he is very skillful in depicting the average characters in life. You find his characters very relatable (as compared to, say, assassins or superheroes), but each character is so different and believable.",

I see why everyone is upset and could not understand why the family would not be okay with DJ, but hear me out. \n\nTruly step into their shoes and imagine your family member getting with your dead fathers mistress\u2019 son. If they marry, you\u2019d be tied with that mistress for the rest of your life since your in-laws. That woman has caused so much chaos since the day she decided to betray her good friend (which is the siblings mother) and get with their father. Think about it. A father who was loving, doting and respectable ( in their eyes) betrayed his wife, his children and his life for a woman he shouldn\u2019t have even dared glanced at. He abandoned his family and the pain and suffering that causes someone is unbearable. \n\nWife traumatized. Children traumatized. Extended family traumatized. It\u2019s a different type of pain, a pain that needs to be taken care of through some therapy imo. \n\nNow I agree, it\u2019s not DJ\u2019s fault. In no way am I blaming him. He\u2019s an innocent man in all of this. But you really have to deeply think about it. How would this make the mother feel? The siblings? They\u2019re still shaken about what happened years ago; they\u2019re just doing their best to move on. \n\nAs a mother, it\u2019d be very difficult to see my daughter date someone who is attached to my ex husbands mistress. Who pushed my children out their home, who most likely stole/hid the will that mentions the kids get the home. It doesn\u2019t matter how great and apologetic of a guy he is. I don\u2019t want to see that woman part of my family tree in no shape or form unless she RIP\ud83d\udc80\n\nAt the end of the day, I am rooting for these two though. I don\u2019t want great chemistry like this wasted if they don\u2019t end up together. Maybe I would\u2019ve tolerated it, if the chemistry wasn\u2019t this good, but it\u2019s amazing. I want them to end up together but I do want people to understand that their family being upset is completely normal. Honestly, I would\u2019ve been surprised if they weren\u2019t upset, just a little bit.",

            "comment": "First thing I really want to mention is how much I really like the entire Shim family. The siblings are adorable and the mother is a pretty nice person, now that we finally get a chance to know her. They are good people. It makes you even sadder that their father, who seemed to have a good relationship with them before, cheated on his wife and abandoned his family.\n\nAnd it continues to emphasize what a blazing trainwreck Dong-jin's mother Hee-ja is.\n\nIt was pretty devastating when Hye-seong was honest about feeling things for Joon, and he basically ran away. They even showed him silently walking away from her from a overhead shot, emphasizing the starkness. But as sad as that moment was, it wasn't hard to figure out why he did that. Joon loves all the Shim siblings, and dating Hye-seong risks losing them all. (So I guess he's just going to have to marry her, in that case. Haha.)\n\nAnd that's how it is for Dong-jin as well. Woo-joo is a package deal, and her cute siblings will be along for the ride.\n\nI know a lot of you have 2521 trauma - I DO TOO!!!! That show seriously gave K-drama fans serious trust issues. So if this show pulls a 2521 I will cry. But I have faith that this drama will not do that to us. Because? K-netz call this drama \"My CEO,\" alluding to \"My Mister\" for a reason. Not to give too much away for those who haven't watched \"My Mister\" yet - but that story was about embracing \\*everything\\* about the person that you love. Including all the \"bad\" things they might have done. Two damaged people, reaching out to each other, then becoming everything to each other. Unconditional love, folks. That show made you believe in it, and this one will, too.\n\nIn previous weeks, I was afraid for Woo-joo. How she will be hurt when the whole truth comes out. But I don't worry about her as much anymore. She's going through all the pain right now. The forthcoming pain will be Dong-jin's - the pain he will feel because he is sorry. Once he finds out the extent of his mother's misdeeds and how much she hurt the Shim family, he will feel like he's not good enough for them and retreat back into his shell.\n\nBut it's okay. Woo-joo will embrace all of him. Because she is the cosmos.\n\n==\n\nETA: a few more thoughts:\n\nFirst is about Suho. I was a bit taken aback by how upset he was when Hye-seong broke up with him. I thought his immature attitude reflected how little he was invested in this relationship. But at least by his standards, he was actually quite invested. He's still not really the right guy for her, but that was kind of surprising.\n\nMy next thought is about Woo-joo's conversations with her mom.\n\n1. How sadly she wept while telling her mom about going to her father's funeral to create a ruckus, and how painful that entire experience was for her. Goodness, imagine when Mom finds out the whole truth later.\n2. Woo-joo lying that she met Hee-ja's son who sincerely apologized to her. It's something that would make her mom feel better about this horrible situation, but also a way to make herself feel better as well. And while this was techinically a lie, she knows that is what Dong-jin would have said.",

Although she can't explain her personal reasons yet, the fact that CEO Shin bashed a rock into her head should be more than enough to make up for whatever she did in the past.\n\n&gt;!I personally predict a happy ending. Hee-ja has no legal claim to their house, since we found out this week that she is hiding Mr. Shim's will, which probably leaves the house to his kids. My guess is that Dong-jin will find it and help the Shim family recover their house.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I feel like the truth will get exposed soon because Hee-ja moved in with Dong-jin. Perhaps Woo-joo comes by Dong-jin's place to finally fetch Ji-gu's things and runs into Hee-ja.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And in the end, Woo-joo will get her revenge after all. She will take from Hee-ja the one good thing that is most precious to her - Dong-jin, just like how she stole their father from them. I feel like if given the choice between Woo-joo and his mom, Dong-jin will choose Woo-joo.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Caveat: My brain is in trashy makjang mode. And I recently watched \"The Glory\" which has infected my brain, too. I feel like these writers will probably come up with something more interesting than what my predictions are.!&lt;",

He took the elevator without seeing WJ enter his building but had the foresight to get off the 9th floor, take the stairs down with the hopes of catching her. He knew and yet he kept quiet and didn't do anything until he caught her going through the mailbox.\n\nThese lines from WJ to DJ may be foreshadowing what's to come in the next episodes, ***\"...are you normally this petty? You knew all along but wanted to see how far I'd go. Pretending not to know, to let it go. Then coming at me when I had no way out... Why did you even pretend? When you were never going to let it slide\".***\n\nThen flashback to DJ pretending not to know that his ex-girlfriend was cheating on him, for a year (!), and again he didn't confront her.\n\nThese are the facts that the drama have given us so far.

Obviously in a very good way, frustrating but good.\n\nOkay so my thoughts about WJ telling DJ about the company spy thing - she literally told him she would not spy for him and that she could turn on him, said ONE sentence to the other dude - that DJ knows of the other guys betrayal and that he needs to work harder if he wants the company to fail. And then came around and helped DJ\u2019s company, turned down the proposal to work for the other guys and everything turned out fine. Even Sun Woo noticed that she came around but should have come clean sooner. I would be surprised it that was the bombshell to break DJ and WJ up, I am way more concerned about their familial connection. \n\nI have a feeling DJ has no clue who WJ is. I used to think he definitely put the two and two together but now I don\u2019t think so - being the person that he is, he would have addressed it with her mom. The mom seems to have found out that HeeJa moved into their house after her initial meeting with DJ so the couldn\u2019t have apologised to her at the karaoke place when they first met - I also don\u2019t think she would have taken it this lightly. \n\nHeeJa is not going anywhere, she would absolutely never accept her ex\u2019s child who wanted to embarrass her publicly as her only son\u2019s gf. He would never want to put WJ through the hell of fighting with his mom. Her family seems to be a little more understanding but still, it would have been a shock. I am not concerned about them being ex step siblings, WJ was 19 when she jumped in front of her dads car and DJ is even older, they never crossed paths and we\u2019re not brought up together. Idk if we have any info on his relationship with her dad (if there even was one, he seems to have been avoiding the mom a lot).\n\nI laughed when WJ called HyeSeong to tell her she is going to regret it so much but she wants to be there etc and HS brushed her off like girl, you\u2019re just staying the night, don\u2019t make it sound like you\u2019re about to die lol\u2019. It captured the difference between them two, to WJ it was a matter of such importance because she isn\u2019t jumping in blindly into a relationship with DJ - to HS, who dated a lot without much consideration just to not be alone, it is completely natural. \n\nRight now I feel like this drama could go either way - they clearly love each other but it would be so hard being together. I hope with all my heart that they get a true happy ending but my gut is telling me we might not get to see it.",

This might be my fav work of LSK so far like her range?? &gt;!the scene with her mom made me cry!&lt; \n\nNo drama since 2521 made me this giddy istg. Gonna savor this ep for now and save ep 12 for tomorrow \ud83d\ude29\n\nEdit: \n\nAND HERE I THOUGHT EP 11 WAS PEAK ROMANCE OMFG. The confession?? &gt;!the kissing &gt; bed scene???? The way his thumb stroked her neck and the way he bit her lips? I died !&lt; this is by far my fav romance drama from this year. It\u2019s so freaking good when it ends I\u2019m gonna be devastated. I love the romance with the underlying layer of melancholy. It\u2019s so gut wrenching and beautiful at the same time. I want WJ to come clean soon but when she &gt;!lied to her family about meeting the son, I groaned out loud!&lt; her internal conflict is so realistic but frustrating. This might be LSK\u2019s best role so far. The way she portrayed complex emotions without saying much was really a master class in acting. Not just the leads but the supporting characters are all so well done. WJ\u2019s mom was a surprisingly nice addition. I love how intense and blunt she is, WJ really resemble her mom in this sense. I hope she surprise us all in the next couple eps bc I really can\u2019t stand seeing her turn against DJ who she\u2019s already so fond of \ud83e\udd72 it\u2019ll really break me. \n\nSigh, gotta wait another week now.",

I really really tried to like her despite me generally not being a fan of people with her type of personality irl (I can't stand people who lie about what they like/think/feel in accordance to what you like/think/feel. I'm on security guard's side on that particular point). But I don't know, I can't help but feel like she's too self-centred. I haven't really seen her show any appreciation for any of the things Woojoo has done for the family which puts me off a bit.  I was expecting a scene somewhere along the way where she sat woojoo down and told her that she can live her own life and stop revolving it around the family. Instead she complains about how Woojoo treats her like she's less capable, which I understand can be demotivating as the older sister but how have we not seen haeseong do a single thing for the family as a whole??? Am I missing something????? And onto the topic of her and Jun.... why couldn't she handle the situation with a little more care? It feels so selfish of her to have confessed to him while still living under his roof.  Jun is way too kind-hearted to even consider kicking her or any of them out which Haeseong definitely should know....so in a way she trapped him? Or did she not consider how potentially uncomfortable he could have felt living with her while being aware of her feelings for him? It's not even about whether or not his feelings are mutual !! I truly believe that if she had a respect for his comfort (not to mention his close friendship with Woojoo), she should've waited until they moved out to confess. (I say this all having been in the exact position Jun is in rn except I did not at all reciprocate the feelings lol). ugh anyways, if anyone can defend her regarding these points please go ahead and do so. I don't like hating characters that weren't written to be hated.",

No one's obliged to take responsibility for their adult siblings. I agree with HS that Woojoo should let go of their brother and let him make mistakes. HS's carefree attitude should have extended to WJ's relationship with Dongjin as well, but she clearly lost it in the episode preview and acts like a jerk imho.\n\nShe also needs to reflect on how she approaches relationships and her inability to be alone. Those are the reasons that her past relationships didn't work out. Instead of reflecting, she decided to find the next partner to repeat the same mistakes. Her ex-bf definitely did something wrong, but at least he was willing to admit to it, while she didn't want to discuss it at all and called it quits.\n\nI am ambivalent about her confession to Jun. She didn't force him to answer, so that's fine. She pays rent so she doesn't owe Jun anything. If Jun feels uncomfortable, he can be an adult and tell her, which he did...",

            "comment": "\r  \nNot really EP11/12 related, but will put this here since it is the current post on this show. About the attention to detail in this show. Here is one that I just caught.\n\n\r  \nOne of the big themes of the show is revenge, and how harmful it is, possibly the most to the one seeking it \u2013 Woojoo appears to be in for a world of hurt for her misguided plan of revenge, Dongjin\u2019s plan to live a happy life to get revenge on Minyoung (rather than live a happy life for himself) only made him \u201cbored and lonely\u201d. And Shin Sulman . . . well, we see how his revenge on Best Fairs ruins him, and it drives so much of the plot for the first 10 episodes, from nearly driving Dongjin\u2019s company out of business, to corporate espionage entangling Cha, Dongjin, and Woojoo, to the drinking and violence that resulted in Woojoo getting hurt \u2013 and her and Dongjin putting aside their petty insecurities and begin being positive and open with each other.\n\n\r  \nAnd in EP6 we find out why he is so driven to revenge \u2013 not so much that Dongjin left and many employees left with him, but because while on his knees begging for Dongjin to stay, he missed a call from his wife, who passed away, and he blames Dongjin for not picking up, not calling emergency services sooner.\n\n\r  \nIf we go back to EP1, we get our first introduction to this revenge, when Ms Baek enters Dongjin\u2019s office and tells him that Best Fairs has lost the Singapore bid, that Shinwoo Fairs has outbid them, and that Shin is clearly targeting them. As Ms Baek leaves, Dongjin gets a call from his mother asking him to come to the funeral.\n\n\r  \nThe time of the call is 9:11.\n\n\r  \nSo, at some point I will have to post about why I think the show writers have Dongjin living in 2701, why Minyoung is in 2702, why they live at building 103, why the house that was taken from the siblings is on 27th Road, and is house number 34. Why Dongjin got off the elevator on the 9th floor of his building and descended the stairs to catch Woojoo going through the mailboxes. Why there is a scene with Minyoung where \u2013 after receiving porridge from Sunwoo, waits as the elevator descends from the 7th floor to the the 3rd floor. And of course I will have to write further on the significance of the number 5, the number of stitches Woojoo receives, the number of booths at Haesung\u2019s bank, and the number that the crosswalk counts down to as Jun is left alone, his blind date leaving him while calling him a crazy bastard. I don\u2019t think any of these numbers are random choices by the showwriters.\r  \n\n\nAt least, that\u2019s how I see it.",

THE SHOW LITERALLY TOLD YOU THEY WEREN\u2019T GOING TO END UP TOGETHER. The fact people were too invested in the cast and the hype for a ~nostalgic school romance with Nam Joohyuk to drop it on the spot and kept watching while doing all sorts of mental contortions to convince themselves the drama was lying to them about the sad ending doesn\u2019t mean THEY WEREN\u2019T WARNED. This doesn\u2019t mean every other romantic melodrama ever is going to keep the main couple apart.\n\nIn fact by every convention of the romantic genre the main couple in Call It Love is going to experience a moment of crisis between episodes 14-16 and figure things out in the final episode. The nature of the inevitable crisis has been clear since episode one, the plot beats are familiar to anyone who\u2019s watched more than 10 kdramas in their life and there\u2019s not a single indication that the ending will be unexpected or unsatisfactory, so why the fuck do we have to discuss baseless comparisons to The Interest of Love (a drama based on a novel with a sad ending), 2521 (a drama that announced its sad ending from the beginning), Nevertheless (one of the trashiest dramas of all time) or whatever instead of savouring the delicious angst this drama is serving us? Haven\u2019t you people seen anything *good*? Ever? One Spring Night, Just Between Lovers, Come and Hug Me, that sort of thing?\n\nIf I see another comment about 2521, my brain is gonna melt at this point.",

I feel like it has done such a good job at subverting all of our expectations and I\u2019m confident that it\u2019ll be a happy ending. I think the past 12 eps have shown us enough of our leads\u2019 personalities/motivations for me to be sure that DJ will not give up on their relationship. WJ will probably be selfless and try to leave but idk, it would be so damn sad for our girl if the writers choose to give her such an unsatisfactory and depressing ending. I have faith that they won\u2019t do her dirty like that. Every time I watch a melodrama this sub always get like this and 90% of the time it\u2019s a happy ending.",

But trust me it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have and I think the show is really trying to highlight that everyone is flawed and not perfect so in that sense I get it.

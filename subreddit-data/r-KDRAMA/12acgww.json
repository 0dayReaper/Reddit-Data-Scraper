He would have suffocated her in the end.  The way he dismissed her thoughts and went straight to the CP to get her back was very unattractive, to say the least. And CP response made me love him even more!!\n\nHopefully, it was due to the shock, and when he calms down, he will change his mind.",

That he basically acquiesced and said that she would choose so herself.\n\nI think that what he will come to realize is that both she and the CP are, in a way, more concerned *his* feelings and *his* happiness.  They are both upfront about this and brave in not avoiding the truth of the matter.\n\nAgain, note the subtle changes...even a softening of character...when he is not overly angry about not being informed...he quickly lets that part go. He *will* accept things as they are and go on as he was sincerely wished...to his own happiness &gt;!(ah, poor princess, she needs to live!)!&lt;",

Hello, she fought off assasins, ran into the mountains after them, limped through it all to find the man she loves, rescued a family and took on a murderous assasin in hand to hand combat, survived jumps from the cliffs.....and she can't carry a bucket because of -fragile arms? Ugh!). That's the best thing this show has outlined: Hwan has always respected Jay Yi's strength and always boosted her confidence (his interest in her keen mind is so refreshing - cue: If he was so stupid would someone as smart as you would have fallen for him?) and treats her as an equal (the door opens outside, those chairs would keep people out you idiot? lol! Spoken like a true friend). More than that he has never played the knight in the shinning armor unless it was absolutely needed (the officer scene where he first lets the women ask for the letter before stepping in). The icing on the cake was Hwan calling Sung On out for thinking of a person like Jay yi as an object.   \n\n\nSuperb writing.   \n\n\nMy only plot hole complain: How come Jay Yi didn't discover the missing knife earlier? Does she always not carry it around?   \n\n\nI do understand her panic though when she went to the Crown Princess quarters - she rushed in hoping to save the princess instead of wasting time trying to get support.",

They better be planning a pent up release big time asap.   \n\n\nMy guess is, the Queen will now move in to take the King out. She does not have enough time and fears being discovered. Everyone is getting ready to go back to hometown, and Tae San already is planning to take Kang back.   \n\n\nThe fish eggs? With the CP all set to be deposed, will she use the eggs to make the final killing? That is the only way she can take the king out and blame it on metal breakdown, and eventual 'unfit' to rule tag, so her 'Song' son ascends the throne with her being the regent. And then taking the Jo family out.   \n\n\nBut our CP is not going to sit still. Now that Minister Han knows the Queen's secret, and Munjin possibly will become privy to Jay Yi's false charge and danger to depose CP, time to gather forces to defeat the Queen and force a confession from her? (the kids knowing about those eggs making people crazy has to come into play). The inn couple definitely will have a role to play as well. Maybe help our couple make an escape?   \n\n\nPossibly Jay Yi could be kidnapped as a last resort by San? The arrow scene is interesting. Court lady Kwan possibly hangs herself to deflect suspicion from the Queen?  I hope the drama can move to another off field fight episode, with CP and Jay Yi at a no holds barred position to let off some of that super torturous steam they have build up through the 18 episodes.   \n\n\nThe drama will not have a sad ending. To show a couple going apart - they need to unite first, which has never happened. And CP is going all out for his woman. My guess is he will end up being the King. With no woman in the palace per se, and Jo clan out, with Han family's blessing, Jay Yi's family honor is restored and elevated, and she is brought back in - to be by Hwan's side when he becomes a ruler of ALL people.",

                                    "comment": "\"I want to be the ruler for ALL my people with you by my side\" - to me that line is the key to the intent and messaging of this drama. It's all about ushering a new era, youth who refuse to be confined within the norms of the society with sacrificing perosnal happiness and fullfilment. Jay yi branching out by herself by sacrificng her love will not do justice to that message as she would not be making any changes - different people have always been an outcast at the end. Her infuence as a woman in this era is pitiful - even the Seargent who has first hand witnessed how brilliant she is, is quick to reduce her to someone who can be 'sent' to him, or can be stiffled.  \n\n\nHowever, the key to happy ending is that now our CP cannot be without wife and children - that would prove the curse right. Jo clan out. Han family girl dead. Only candidate left - Jay Yi.   \nMy guess is - end scenes will have our CP with a unique wife (who won't back down from throwing some volleys at her husband in private) and a few kids running around with Jay Yi gathering them 'Under the Queen's umbrella' style. Hopefuly another tomboy princess on the horizon collecting 'fees' to help the underdog.....  \n\n\nI found it intgeresting that they placed the show around 1500 AD. Very interesting. It was one of the most prosperous era of Josean period.",

Who knew cold fusion was a thing back in the Joseon era?\n* Our section chief is a good guy...indubitably...but he struggles with duty and honor, with a weakness in resolving conflicts, for him everything seems absolute.  The CP schools him in this...which is why he will \"betray\" his promise...and for the right and best reasons...not, definitely not, because he desires her for his own.  It might take a little while for that to sink in, but I think SO will come around soon.\n* Back to MJY...there have been some complaints that she seems lately out of character...but I think that was more a pattern with all of our characters, a slight relaxation, taking of breaths, little stumbles before the final girding of loins for the final battles.  So here she is once again in her element, doing what not only can be done, but what *must* be done, in a way changing even reality itself.  That is indeed genius, and I think we can trust that she will always find a way.  Which leads us to...\n* The darkness before the dawn, the inescapable confluence of all consequence...and the truth rising from the ashes of deception.\n\nGreat show u/freyfreyaaa!

He first needs to respect jay Yi for who she is and see beyond her 'fragile' arms and the 'law and duty' that woukd effectively make her his chattel. What a terrible outlook. Hopefully its his acute jealousy speaking, having caught on Jay yi and Hwan's love for each other already (the flashback was stupendouly effective, cuts to the chase pretty quick).",

He doesn't acknowledge his own feelings and rationalizes them when they are expressed.\n\nSo, for instance, there is more than a bit of jealousy and doubt of friendship when he confronts the CP.  He might be \"testing\" trying to test the CP by his questions.  But the CP sees to the heart...of course he is his friend, but he cannot keep that promise which betrays another friend, that doing so would actually degrade her.\n\nI think the sergeant will soon realize this and he will become *our* sergeant once again.",

Of course I do not agree with that way of thinking, but just trying to understand where Seong On is coming from, the deeply ingrained belief and societal norms of that era, it really takes a VERY SPECIAL PERSON like CP to defy these norms and conventions. Hopefully Seargent SO will come around, and i think he will to a great extent (maybe not 100%), but at this point i guess i can forgive him as he is still a work in progress. I believe he has a good heart, so he will likely come around.",

It's true that in sageuks the big battle for the throne is always at the end of the penultimate/beginning of the last episode...but after all this intrigue, we do deserve at least half an episode of fluff.\n\nThe prize for the smartest person in this episode goes to the Princess for taking care of her own &gt;!protection by enlisting \"her man\".!&lt; I was begrudgingly against the Princess ending up with Sargeant because he would have to give up public service to be with her, but now I don't care. Hwan will take care of it with some special royal edict. The way she was &gt;!clutching his arm!&lt; and then &gt;!slashed the assassin to protect him!&lt; sealed it for me. It almost made me think of a possible ending like Goong/Princess Hours. And if you haven't seen Goong, read the spoiler only if you don't care about watching it: &gt;!the Crown Prince abdicates his position and lives happily ever after with his beloved, while the smart Princess becomes the Queen and runs the country. Unfortunately, this is Joseon so that's not possible.!&lt;\n\nIt's a bit weird that the Evil State Minister has kind of disappeared and now all focus is left on the Queen, but it's a house of cards. If &gt;!the Queen's plot is revealed and everyone finds out she's from the Song family, the Evil State Minister is also done since he brought her in.!&lt;\n\nAs usual, I think the preview is trying to throw us off.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m starting to think we won\u2019t get a happy ending or it\u2019s gonna be bittersweet (extra emphasis on the bitter). The mystery is so intense and entangled it could take at least two episodes to solve everything. It seems like the CP is connecting the dots but what we forget is that our team has little to no evidence. If they are to bring this in front of the king and the court they need damning evidence. Our villains are very good at being villains and might find ways to exonerate themselves if the evidence is weak. And because this isn\u2019t the 21st century they can only rely on confessions and word of mouth. This will take time, it took 17 episodes to get this point, but every time there was evidence against the minister (I don\u2019t remember if he\u2019s right or left state minister, but I\u2019m talking about the queen\u2019s \u201cuncle) or someone is willing to talk they die. And we all know dead men tell no tales. Unless of course the villains confess themselves (fingers crossed). \n\nApart from that if Jae Yi and the CP do get married there are so many rules to adhere to. Potentially a lot of laws to break just so she can be queen. A king still has to listen to his officials to a certain degree. The push back against Jae Yi becoming Queen might just come from all sides (friend and foe) especially if the entire truth of where she\u2019s been and how she\u2019s stayed alive is exposed. This in turn directly weakens the CP\u2019s reputation especially if word gets out that the CP (hopefully King by that time) decides to marry his best friend\u2019s betrothed, who also happens to be the son a high ranking official. It\u2019ll be very hard to make Jae Yi Queen if the show decides to take a realistic route. \n\n\nMind you Han Sung\u2019s dad is one out of the only two officials tasked with helping the CP\u2019s ascension to the throne. Once all this gets revealed it\u2019ll be a sign of great disrespect to his family. We have no  idea how Han Sung or even his father might take this. (They all are very understanding people, so I have faith it won\u2019t be too bad for too long). But the CP might loose a very important connection that he needs to ascend the throne. I fear that the relationship between CP and Han Sung might have some irreparable damage. Even if they do make up and everyone is happy, it is not easy to forget that your supposed to be dead fianc\u00e9 has been living with your best friend and he didn\u2019t tel you at all. That is not a wound easily healed. We unfortunately do not have enough episodes to flesh it out. (I may be wrong though).\n\nMost importantly who\u2019s to say Jae Yi would actually enjoy that life. She will be confined to the palace for the rest of her life. Realistically she might have to forfeit Eunuch Go at a certain point. I do not know if love would be enough to sustain her through that. I do believe Jae Yi would  make changes and a have a great impact on the nation if she becomes queen. I also believe so much of her power would be directly linked to what the King would allow her to do, as well as  linked to what would be seen as acceptable for not only a woman but a queen. Her potential actions and reforms have to be seen as acceptable not only in the eyes of the officials at court but in the kingdom as well. That is an insanely suffocating way to live and may restrict her from making the change in the world she\u2019d like to make. One thing about Jae Yi is she loves her freedom. Even if she become a concubine she would loose a lot of agency she freely enjoys now. I doubt Jae Yi has had the time to look that far ahead in the future as it seems she has ruled out marrying the crown prince, but it would be great to see her genuinely consider what life by his side as Jae Yi would really be like. I can\u2019t help but think about Deok Im from the red sleeve when I think about Jae Yi\u2019s freedom.\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019ve always rooted for Jae Yi and the CP but I\u2019m just scared because we only have 3 episodes left and this beautifully planned out mystery has taken center stage in the show (which is something that I love). I fear we won\u2019t have enough time to flesh out a realistic happy ending so the writers may have opted for a bittersweet or a straight up unhappy ending. I also love the show, I haven\u2019t disliked one episode so I\u2019m trusting the writers. I just think I\u2019ll need a box tissues beside me next week.\n\n(P.S i could be wrong, very very very wrong. Tbh I really hope I am. I guess it just depends on the route and tone the writers decided to take regarding the end of the show especially for the relationship between CP, Jae Yi, and Han Sung. I don\u2019t mind an unrealistic but happy ending, I just need to make it sense)",

They also continue their nation building efforts together in the end.!&lt; There\u2019s also *Love in the Moonlight* with an open ending where &gt;!FL gets back her identity and we see the CP visit her in the end but they don\u2019t tell us if they married or not.!&lt; Or maybe a *King\u2019s Affection* ending, &gt;!where they both run away and he lives as Scholar Park. It\u2019s plausible since the weight of the crown has been heavy on him and his brother is there.

It is way too stifling to be queen or even concubine. And, since CP's and JY's bond is anchored on being intellectual equals who have the same vision of a more just society, she is probably better off as his lifelong trusted friend and unofficial adviser. In most sageuks I have watched, Kings are never portrayed as discussing state matters with their Queens (perhaps it is prohibited for the Queen to discuss politics, just as it is supposedly forbidden for the CP to do so???), heck, Kings are never portrayed as discussing ANYTHING significant or personal with their Queens, and perhaps just get together to procreate out of duty.",

Also I want to sympathize with poor people who had been wrongly accused but they keep making them out as such lunatics???\n\n On the positive side: I loved Myung Jin's logic \"I don't want to let the CP know that I know that's it's him because I would like to keep treating him the same\".

            "comment": "***UPDATED EPISODE 18 THOUGHTS!***\n\nWOW!! I don't know why I doubted the writers for a second.  What a powerhouse episode!! I have butterflies, chills, anxiety, anticipation, excitement! Words can barely describe how great this show is turning out! \n\nThe pacing was great and with everything we have learned in this episode, I didn't feel rushed for even a moment! I am completely at the feet of this drama and it will forever be a favorite. \n\nI was breathless when &gt;! The seargent quietly confronted JaeYi. His passion, his sense of duty, his care and concern were palpable. I ADORED the moment they shared. Especially bc that moment was immediately ripped out from under me when he goes outside and sees the CP and you can feel that the seargent is almost jealous? Or maybe yearning for the CP to tell him he's wrong about knowing that JaeYi loves the CP. He doesn't want to believe it. !&lt;\n\nI am so frustrated that JaeYi &gt;! Just recklessly runs into the CrownPrincess chambers and then TOUCHES THE DAMN BLADE?! LIKE HELLLOOOOOOOOOO. ARE YOU INSANE?! !&lt; \n\nI am so in awe of the writers ability to continually keep me guessing. I love that it's not feeling rushed or forced, but penultimate and exciting beyond what I could imagine. \n\nHyungSiks acting is just phenomenal. His expressions are so deep and ever-residing just below the surface. Absolute *chefs kiss* perfection from PHS.\n\nI haven't stopped worrying about a bittersweet ending. The fact that he hasn't &gt;! Given JaeYi the key to the house, makes me think she is going to get it after he dies or something crazy. This could be my KTrauma anxiety making an appearance, HAHA, I wish I could blindly believe in a happy ending. They deserve it.!&lt;\n\nWaiting for next week is gonna be KILLER. \ud83d\ude2d \n\n\nEpisode 17 thoughts:\n\nEverything is coming together just like a lot of us had predicted! I was not expecting &gt;! the monk to be take himself out so early. I was expecting him to be a big-bad until the end.!&lt; \n\nI am so tense about the next episode now. For so long, although there has been a conflict, everything has felt a little \"neat\", for lack of a better word, and now I just know we are headed for some serious chaos. With the set up &gt;! that our seargent could turn his back on the CP and JaeYi, I feel so deeply for what he is about to feel. But, in the same vein, I can't imagine he would ever aim his sword at the CP, no matter what secrets he held. The Seargent LITERALLY fought, who he thought was TaeKang and even approached him without violence to expose him to the CP. It feels far too out of character for him to get that unhinged bc of JaeYi. Fingers crossed. !&lt; \n\nPart of the beauty of this show is the build-up of tension that is expertly stacked on every side. We have so much to lose when this all explodes. As well as so much to gain. \n\nI was really happy to see our coroner &gt;! being all courteous and cute with GaRam. I am shipping them so hard.!&lt;\n\nI know I've been expecting the lid to blow off and all of the chaos to hit, I am just worried &gt;! that we only have 3 episodes to jam it all in. I want a happy ending for longer than 5 minutes on screen. We deserve at least that. !&lt;\n\nCheers to 18 tomorrow!",

I rewatched all episodes without subtitles just to see his gorgeous face. He is true royalty. His facial expressions command authority, unlike the seargent who looks like he will always cry at any moment.   \nHis character as a crown prince again raise the standard for potential bf/husband, sadly, he does not exist, or if he does, he is a rare gem. I definitely share Jae Yi's impressions about him - He is not just smart, but a genius; he has a pure heart; he's great in physical combat, loves to read, open minded, wiling to accept unconventional ways if it's for the better, a test of someone's integrity, he's so sweet and thoughtful, not to mention, very generous. Like what the left minister said, he is perfect as the future king/leader.\n\n\\- Jae Yi\n\nI love her character. If we could just see past the physical attributes, like skinny arms that many here have commented, and just focus on what she has been doing the past 18 episodes, she's the type of FL that I would want to see more in K-dramas. She's the female version of the CP, so they're equal, and they deserved each other. Unlike other Kdramas where the FL is like a damsel in distress, needing to be rescued by the ML. That's why I'm really not happy about High Society, I would want Hyungsik to end with the female chaebol instead of her friend. I mean, there is really nothing special about that girl that Hyungsik would fall for her. Same with Hwarang, I don't really mind about King Jin Heung not getting the FL, there is nothing special about that girl, the King deserves better.\n\nFor me, KDramas somehow is a source of inspiration for me. So I really appreciate strong FLs like Jae Yi. It makes me want to be the best version of myself. I mean, if I want a king, then, I should be queen material, otherwise, it would also not be fair for the king. Relationship is a partnership - we should be able to protect each other, not just the king protecting the queen. Also, the queen needs to be the king's best ally - so she should be really smart to help the king make the best decision. Also, the queen will be the one to raise the future king. Like they say, you cannot give from an empty cup, how could the queen teach her kids if she's just a \"trophy wife\"?",

I guess I have to accept the fact that this is not the usual romance that I've come to love about PHS (SWDBS and Soundtrack #1).  This is more like Suits and Happiness, where romance is just a small part of the big picture, like  a dash of salt in a delicious dish. Having said that, leveling expectations is imperative so as not to be frustrated on this show. This is the main reason I'm here in Reddit. It's nice to read comments and share our thoughts about this show. Doing so, makes it less frustrating. With 2 episodes left, I have no expectations anymore. I just want to finish it and still see PHS, until Dr. Slump.\n\nI'm thinking the end could be as frustrating as Military Prosecutor, where there is not a single kiss though it's still a happy ending:(\n\nHaving changed my expectations about OBY not a pure romance, looking back on the past 18 episodes, I could still say that I love this film and I love the characters, so it's not a waste of time. To be fair, no one said it's pure romance, they said it's a mix of different themes. Still, of course, I want more romance, hence, the frustration.",

So probably for a long time the queen and her minions were just trying to hide and fit in.  Maybe in their eyes the fact that the king blindly believed the right minister and gave the order makes him just as guilty if not more so.  Just getting rid of the right minister doesn\u2019t change the system.

As one comment here, if it's PHS, there is no 2nd lead syndrome. I hope Seong-on also has a happy ending, he deserves that for being kind and loyal and a great catch as well (bf/husband).\n\nI love the scene in episode 18 where he confronted Jae Yi and talked to the CP afterwards. In all 18 episodes, this is the only scene where I cried, aside from the scene of Tae-gang (where he asked the CP to kill him because of his evil twin brother). He did not angrily confronted/accused Jae Yi for not going to her, instead, he even apologized for not recognizing her sooner and not taking care of her as she is going through so much pain. \n\nI get the part when he said that \"if she understands the law and duty, she will come to me on her own.\" I mean, it's Joseon era afterall. But with his character - kind and logical, he will surely let go of Jae Yi and not forced her to marry him.\n\nThe princess looks too young for him either. I hope he could find someone who is also his equal, in the same vein that Jae Yi is CP's equal - in brains, heart, and looks:) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tae-gang\n\nI love this boy. He has his own charms, maybe because he has the same birthday as my gorgeous Hyungsik:)\n\nI love his interactions with Jae Yi, where they are like siblings, dog-cat kind of thing. \n\nI cried when he asked the CP to kill him. He has gone through so much since he was a kid, still he has a pure heart. Maybe because he knows that there are still good people like the CP and Seong-on. I love his backstory. I love that he is loyal the CP. \n\nThe CP needs great allies like Jae Yi, Seong-on, Myung-jin, and that scholar,  Jang-eui.",

            "comment": "Lastly, the 2 other characters that I love:\n\n* Myung-jin\n\nJae Yi is very lucky to capture the hearts of 3 great men: the CP, Seong-on, and Myung-jin. \n\nI love all the scenes of Myung-jin, it's the best part for the mystery side of this film. I also love his scenes with the icycle/woodpecker - when he's acting cool and then, being rejected. Especially the part where Jae Yi and Ga Ram tried to comfort him by saying they would be first in line to be Myung jin's potential wife, while wearing man's clothes. I love Myung jin's facial expression in this scene, esp when he said to eunuch go, \"you're not even a man.\"\n\nI also love his interactions with his mom and dad, typical of the \"bunso\"/youngest kid. \n\nI love that he loves our CP and considers him as a friend. Our CP indeed need him, especially when he becomes King. Ga Ram is so on point when she told the icycle that a \"there will come a time where a scientist like Myung jin will be properly acknowledge for his talents and immerse contributions.\"\n\nSome commenters seem to hate him, especially the way he laughs. For me, he is great in his role. Typical of the nerd types - genius, cute, has a pure heart, very inquisitive, I even love his sense of humor. \n\nI also love his interactions with Ga Ram, especially when he walked her home, knowing that she is a woman. Another scene where I really liked him was when he saved Ga Ram from that moron minister who is bent on punishing the kid who accidentally broke his vase. I also cannot forget the time when he forced the CP to shovel:)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ga Ram\n\nGa Ram is best friend material. I love loyal people. She is like Seong on to our CP. I also cried when Jae Yi told the CP that Ga Ram is her best friend and that \"we could only persevere during the darkest moments when we have someone to protect\" (something to this effect) and then she asked the CP to protect Ga Ram too.\n\nI would love Ga Ram to end up with Myung Jin (she is the only one who would read books about dead bodies with him), I just don't know how his mom would react hahaha.\n\nGa Ram is also smart, not to mention pretty and has great fighting skills too. Given the proper opportunities, like good education that is only reserved for the noble people, she would be a great gf/wife material too. \n\nIt's just weird that Myung Jin was the one who taught Ga Ram to write, not Jae Yi. Jae Yi should have taught Ga Ram to read and write, at the very least, and also proper martial arts, as she is her partner in crime, not to mention her best friend.\n\nTae Gang could also be a great bf/husband for Ga Ram, if Myung Jin mom would just make her life hell. Imagine Jae Yi and Tae Gang bickering during family events hahhaa.",

There are too many loopholes yet to be covered, and the preview of 18th episode mostly shows the next episode to revolve around sergeant knowing jae yi's true identity. Relation between the queen and song, bakchogyan(spelling my bad), the king, the previous CP, right state minister. The romantic angle of the series is yet to be unveiled. The son of prime minister and garam, CP and jae yi, and probably the princess and sergeant. Either it will be a season 2 or a very chaotic non satisfactory ending either it will be good or bad.

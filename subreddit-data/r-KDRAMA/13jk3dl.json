I would have watched it sometime between the mid 2000's to mid 2010's.\n\nI think the couple got married or engaged quite quickly in the show. Female lead was very much in love with the male lead, but he wasn't as interested/invested as she was (he may have been in a relationship when they met or just recently broke up with his girlfriend?). \n\nI think he may have decided to propose/marry her because of her families wealth. Her parents may have gifted them a house for the engagement or wedding present?\n\nI vaguely remember a scene where they're on a bridge/road crossing and she's crying as she realises he isn't in love with her/ doesnt or didn't really want to marry her or is maybe still in love with his ex?\n\nI know, all super vague and not helpful, but hoping the collective brain/memory of reddit can help \ud83d\ude4f",

She gets the little boy out of the room, and then it becomes clear he is the son of a rich guy.\n\nI also know there was a part in which the MC is almost too late for an interview, and the rich guy gets her a dresser and make up artist, and gets her on time to the interview.",

I feel like I may be mixing two shows together but someone please let me know if they can recognize it. \nSo I remember in one of the first episodes the female lead was being walked home by the male lead(?)  (I think she played a detective) and it was raining and she went inside and he left. She ended up being killed in her home and for some reason the male lead came back, I think he may have forgot something of hers or wanted to tell her something but he knocked on the door and she didn\u2019t answer so he felt like something was wrong. They police came and found her. She was in the show still I think playing as a ghost and trying to solve her murder alongside the male lead.  (Spoiler!!) \n&gt;! I think her ex who was a prosecutor and was the one who ended up killing her !&lt; Please does anyone know this show?!!!",

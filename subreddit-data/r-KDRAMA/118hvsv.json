            "comment": "SOLVED\n\nI've been thinking about this side plot of a drama for a while but I can't remember the drama it was from. There is an old woman, who might be blind, that calls a man \"Oraboeni\" but we find out in the drama that it's not her real brother. Her real brother was separated from her in a war when they were kids, but she doesn't know this and thinks the man who has been pretending to be her brother for decades is her actual brother. I think the pretend brother might have been responsible for her real brother disappearing or something. We hear about the story from the real brother who I think eventually found her and has been watching her from a distance. \n\nI think the FL finds out and wants to fix things but is told not to meddle. The drama is set in modern day and is probably a rom-com because that's most of what I watch. I'm really confused about what drama it might have been in because I don't know if the real brother, now an old man, was one of the main characters. I can't remember how this side plot relates to the main plot so I can't narrow it down on my list of watched dramas. I watched it a while ago so it's probably from before 2020.

I watched it with my brother I think in a year around 2007-2010 but we cried alot at the ending, some of the details I mentioned might be completely made up in my mind lol",

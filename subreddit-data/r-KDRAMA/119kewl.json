    "postText": "Hi! I'm doing a study for my AP Research class about binge-watching behaviors with K-dramas and would really appreciate it if you guys filled out my survey!! The study is only targeted for **16-25 year olds** because this age range tends to develop the most severe binge-watching habits, which is what I want to study. The survey should only take maybe 5-10 mins and the presentation of my results will be kept **anonymous**. Also, it is preferable if you could sign your full name for the consent form as I require some type of identification that the participant consents to be in the study. However, no one besides me will be seeing the direct responses from the survey. If you guys have any questions you can just reply to this post or message me and (though my school blocks reddit so I might not get to you till I'm home sorry) I'll respond as soon as possible! If you guys could also share this with your friends who watch K-dramas and fit into the 16-25 year age range, then that would be super helpful! Thank you!!\n\nLink: [https://forms.gle/aPUquP4hvkaJ2BXx5](https://forms.gle/aPUquP4hvkaJ2BXx5)",

Not sure if you like crafty projects or if your illness limits what you can do, but when Covid hit and I was out of work, I decided to find some hobbies to keep me busy. One of those hobbies was watching kdramas and learning about Korea. I them started to comb the internet and discovered some ideas on Youtube. I never, ever had hobbies as an adult and three years later, after gathering ideas from Youtube and joining facebook groups with focussed interests and hearing from those sources about all sorts of things, I can\u2019t believe how occupied I can be. :) I\u2019m willing to share some examples.

I work really long hours so my leisure time for the week is isolated in a block on either Saturday or Sunday. Plus I hate switching from one thing to another, so it's often more convenient to just watch through a third of a drama at a time.",

            "comment": "Listening to the redditors on this forum has really upped my odds of picking good kdramas to watch! So before the hockey game starts, here is my review of **Dali and Cocky Prince** (2021, 16 eps), starring Park Gyu-Young and Kim Min-Jae.\n\nEverything about the plot feels comfortably familiar, but the care and craft visible on screen elevate it above so many similar dramas. Kim Da-li (Park Gyu-Young) is the only child of a prestigious family. She's elegant, intelligent, and extremely well educated, and is the type of bookish scholar who forgets to eat while she's working and binges on sugary junk food.\n\nDue to a mix-up at the Amsterdam airport, Da-li picks up Jin Moo-Hak (Kim Min-Jae) instead of the intended visitor to her gallery. Moo-Hak is in Amsterdam representing his family's company, Dondon (I really want a t-shirt with their logo on it for some reason), which owns a chain of restaurants. Moo-Hak and his family are the nouveau riche, the \"new money\" types who fight over every penny because they came from nothing. Moo-Hak himself has such infectious bro energy he's amazing to watch, even while he's constantly sticking his foot in his mouth. The last time I saw Minjae was in **Tempted** playing the 2ML, so I really enjoyed seeing him again in his proper place in the OTP.\n\nA cabal of politicians and businessmen threaten Da-Li's family art gallery, and the conspiracy ramps into overdrive following the death of Da-Li's father, Kim Nak-Cheon (Jang Gwang, appearing in many many flashbacks where he dispenses wisdom like a true mensch), when Da-Li assumes control of the gallery and Moo-Hak inserts himself into the proceedings due to a loan owed to him.\n\nI couldn't help but think, as I watched D&amp;CP, that this drama achieves what I think **Vincenzo** failed at, i.e., having a realistic conspiracy and villain as an opponent which was just enough of the plot to string together all the romance and feel-good ensemble parts. D&amp;CP is like a beautiful Grandfather clock that's wound and set in motion for the first time. It unfolds simply but elegantly, floating on a soundtrack of classical themes and newer upbeat songs, with an artist's eye to mise-en-scene that reminded me strongly of early Alfred Hitchcock. Yeah, I said that. Hitchcock had a background as a painter and set designer, and like him, director Lee Jung-Sub frames every shot with that same sense of care.\n\nI was so delighted I immediately looked up Jung-Sub to see if I've seen anything by him before, and it turns out I have not. The only thing I recognized on his list was **Healer** (2014-2015) and that only because people on the subreddit speak highly of it. I think I'll look forward  to what comes next. (When I looked that up, I read they originally offered the ML in D&amp;CP to Lee Jae-wook (**Alchemy of Souls**). Not gonna lie, I would've liked it just as well.)\n\n**Random Things:**\n\n* So many amazing actors in this ensemble! Hwang Bo-ra is a national treasure, Hwang Hee is the bestest brother, Woo Hee-jin and Ahn Se-ha play so well off each other as gallery employees, and Ahn Gil-Gang as Moo-Hak's dad reminds me why I loved him so much as the bestest monk, Kong Gul Ah Je in **Iljimae**.\n* It bears repeating: Bo-ra as Yeo Mi-ri, Moo-Hak's assistant, is all the assistant goals, especially her wardrobe of kickass lady suits.\n* MLs who can cook and FLs who can't is such a trope, but it's really adorable in this drama. The villain even comes up with food-related insults for the ML, while the FL crushes up vitamins into an omelet, meaning well but with disastrous results.\n* The underlying philosophy of class warfare and rich v. poor v. nouveau riche v. the power of art to democratize is a clear throughline without being overbearing.\n* The skinskip! An FL with unapologetic desires who actually instigates kisses instead of freezing like a deer in headlights at the first touch of lips! Probably one of the best love scenes I've seen in a kdrama, right up there with the married couple in **Flower of Evil** (my previous high bar for kdrama skinship).\n* Park Gyu-young's wonderfully subtle acting. It's no shock that Da-Li is beautiful, but her full smile is like a laser beam of joy and it's deployed so sparingly, it's all the more splendid for its rarity. Her performance was top notch and her chemistry with Minjae was clear on screen.\n\nOkay I ran against the character limit again, sorry. Anyway! If you like modern romantic dramas that are well-acted and well-paced and funny as all hell, don't skip this one.",

It hits the same notes as one of my all-time favourites, **Just Between Lovers** (people healing together from shared past trauma), but with less repetitive trauma and a not at all annoying SML.  \n\nThe acting is top notch. We all know how versatile Shin Hye Sun is, but Yang Se Jong is able to match her note-for-note. Baby Ahn Hyeo Seop is so cute and perfect for his role.\n\nThere's a great OST too - FL is a violinist so there's a beautiful selection of classical music complemented by more modern songs.  The OST here reminds me of the one for OBS - impactful and distinct but unobtrusive.\n\nHighly recommended if you are looking for a thoughtful take on the coming-of-age story!",

From SUJU to BIGBANG to 2NE1, heck even Jaejoong came. Taeyang also sang the wedding song and I'm over here like \ud83e\udd7a\n\nGod I love to see celebs getting married, especially with how Knetz usually are, it's nice to see them settle down with someone they truly like.",

Guess what, I binged it within three days.\n\nWish the episode count was 4/5 instead of 8 because the the killer became apparent at the very beginning and the story felt very dragged on, but entertaining enough to keep watching. The last episode was totally unnecessary, overly dramatic and idiotically stretchy. \n\nThe characters were fun and quirky. I enjoyed the 500 guy and cosmetic lady the most, they were naturally very funny. Lee kwang soo was surprisingly very stiff compared to other fun characters. The police could take the dumbest, most useless award if it was a thing. The detective guy was funny though.\n\nOnce again I am blown away by the child actors. The kid who played fatty was too good, yool was pretty good too.\n\nAn easy, fun watch. **(7.5/10)**",

But picked up **My Perfect Stranger** this week, I LOVE time travel plots, and this has me intrigued. \n\nI hope **Stealer** ends up getting a wider release because I quite like it, it's a lot of fun, and my history nerd is loving the connections. \n\nI'm still sticking with **The Secret Romantic Guesthouse,** but I'm sort of torn on it. I really like Kang Hoon's character and I wish we got more of this story. I think the whole series is an ambitious plot, and I like pieces of it, but there is so much going on that a lot of it's being missed and huried. I'm not as invested in the leads as I probably should be. I'm also thinking the ending of the second couple is not going to be a happy one.",

Mostly I'm waiting to have all episodes of **Desire Catcher** out before starting it since I really like Zheng Ye Cheng even if not all of his dramas are good ones.",

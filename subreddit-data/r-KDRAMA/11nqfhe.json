    "postText": "kind of a sht post lol. I've been watching a few Makjang dramas. I think I've watched enough to know the formula pretty well. It's now officially become a favorite guilty pleasure of mine. I love campy over-the-top ridiculous stuff. some stuff i find amusing/hilarious that happen in every makjang drama:\n\n* someone will lose their memory at some critical point in the series\n* women will slap eachother or grab hair and shake the other person\n* men will punch eachother or grab by the collar\n* an ajhumma character: she gossips continuously, has a son she thinks is god's gift to humanity and can usually be seen making kimchi or some other pickled side dish\n* an older female character will at some point get sick from worry or other such mental troubles, and will be in bed while wearing a white headband\n* the evil rich people sit behind a table and have meals but the pure hearted poor people sit around on the ground to eat\n* SALT THROWING lol\n* the good FL has everyone fall in love with her for no reason while the bad FL is chasing after some guy who is in love with the good one\n* the good FL is exceptionally talented at the exact thing the bad FL needs to be good at\n* questionable incestuous love stories - while they never are actually incest because the characters aren't biologically related to eachother, there's a lot of gray area. This isn't a favorite of mine, it just happens in almost all of these shows.\n* car accidents !\n* the long lost child saving their parent's life\n* why do they even do DNA tests if it's so easy to fabricate them? lol just make a word document and print it out and call it a dna test at this point\n* the evil chairman's right hand man who is either in love with his wife or his daughter and is this dark mysterious figure\n* female character played by 80lbs tiny women who for some reason know Kung Fu and will destroy you \n* women falling and almost tripping but the ML is there to catch her and they stare into each other's soul for a few seconds in a tango dip position \n\nanything i'm missing?",

It's also one of IU's best performances from an acting standpoint, imo.\n\nIt's about three sisters in the same family. It stars IU, Yoo Inna, Jo Jung Suk, and Jung Woo amongst others.\n\nhttps://asianwiki.com/You_Are_The_Best!_Lee_Soon-Shin\n\nThey even released it for free on YouTube with english subtitles (it was a KBS2 Sat/Sun 50-episode drama): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPzdIHf-EQM&amp;list=PLMf7VY8La5RH9WZlNQfwnilE-uSKlEshz",

The first one doesn't have the best subtitles, but the second one does. ITs also very juicy and annoying and definitely will give you the urge to wanna punch someone. (like that ex-boyfriend)\n\nHonestly, watching them knowing what they are is the best way to do it. It's entirely a guilty pleasure thing, and it's a lot of fun if you don't take it seriously.

Or they hit someone else that falls over and something lands on their grumpy love interest. \"YA!\"\n\nI also get a kick out of dramas that go into detail about how insanely rich a character is. Usually a music filled montage of their lavish spending and golfing habits complete with fast paced editing,wide panning shots of party scenes or people dressed rather well. Bonus points if they step out of a car with sunglasses and a fur coat.\n\nChase scenes on foot for hilarious to me too. Even when they're not suppose to be. Just something about people running, screaming through a neighborhood just makes me laugh. \n\nGirls (spunky characters at least) tend to run with their arms close to their body.They put so much effort into the facial expressions too. But they don't look like they're not going very fast. \n\nGuys run like looney tunes characters. Flailing their arms as if they're running on butter and oil, looking behind them every 5 seconds.

I just loved how complicated and entangled the relationships the characters have with each other and how you can't predict what's gonna happen. Also loved how fun it was and not stressful at all if you compare it to other dramas.",

I was hoping for someone more experienced. \n\nNot to mention it's being co-produced by [\uc544\ud06c\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%95%84%ED%81%AC%EB%AF%B8%EB%94%94%EC%96%B4) which has managed do produce one of my lowest rated dramas (The Goddess of Revenge) and a *string* of dramas where I felt the writing was weak so I have (currently) very, very little faith in their drama writer selection abilities. And the worst part of the string of badly written dramas is that their premises all sounded interesting/fun but the actual script did not live up to the premise for me.",

I\u2019m not sure what I expected in the beginning, but where the drama has progressed to has been an exciting and nerve-wracking journey. I\u2019ve mostly binged k-dramas, but watching this one week-by-week has made me think about the details in an entirely different way. Considering the tumult that has already occurred, I know 15&amp;16 will be wilder than a mechanical bull with a drunk operator. Congratulations to the creators, crew, and cast- this has been a phenomenal drama no matter how it ends. \ud654\uc774\ud305!",

The 80\u2019s were a tumultuous time in South Korea politically. They still hadn\u2019t become a true democracy, so I\u2019ve loved how they set up the NSA guy and gave him his rightful hold on power and connection to Cheol-Woong\u2019s mother. \nThe main reason I watched is I loved the thought of two boys fighting for Jung Shin. I just love her as an actress, and frankly Choo Yeong-Woo who plays Cheol-Woong is one of my favorite actors. I haven\u2019t seen Jang Dong-Yoon before in a drama, and he completely won me over as the tragically sympathetic Lee Doo-Hak. Confucianism is something I\u2019m not as familiar with as an American, but I love how this drama has explored the evolution of this ideology as it was embedded into Korean society while it came up in the western world on its way to becoming a world power. Sending Doo-Hak to prison in place of Cheol-Woong was a fabulous flash point. Making them biological brothers just amplified their enmity and I hope the revelation is satisfying. The character I hate the most is Cheol-Woong\u2019s mother. I genuinely hope she falls hard for the wrongs she has done. I love Doo-Hak\u2019s gang. All those actors play off each other well and a genuine camaraderie shows through the screen. Oh Man Ok has been a surprising character to watch as well. I think he\u2019s very handsome, which was important to soften the brutal type of character he is. I sort of like him which is an interesting feeling, but it\u2019s probably because I think he\u2019ll inflict the most pain on Cheol-Woong\u2019s mother. Jung Shin\u2019s movie business was a good move, and I love her as a character. I love her interactions with Doo-Hak\u2019s mom, and she\u2019s brought me to tears multiple times. Seol In-A is very good in this, but I love a strong female lead. I was very surprised they killed Doo-Hak\u2019s father, and I was so sad about his death despite everything he did for the Choi family. I will say the editing was clunky in the first few episodes. I don\u2019t usually notice scene changes, but some were entirely too abrupt in the first few episodes. It\u2019s gotten much better thankfully, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve kept the story cohesive. It almost feels like a Vincenzo to me which one of the highest compliments I can give it. Jang Dong-Yoon isn\u2019t quite as charming as Song Joong-Ki, but he\u2019s darn near close. The songs are good as well. The main love song is done by a singer named Jemma that I can\u2019t find a lot of information about. Her voice is unique and haunting and I hope I can hear more from her. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll wrap things up. It looks like Cheol-Woong is going to have one last swing at Doo-Hak which infuriates me, but I hope Doo-Hak lands the knock-out. I also like that Doo-Hak and Jung Shin are solid, we aren\u2019t waiting for her to pick. Unless someone dies, they\u2019ll be together so I\u2019m just trying to temper what I think will happen.!&lt; \nAfter all that, I would love to hear what you think too!!",

Though to be honest, I am not expecting a lot with this drama except great acting and chemistry between cast members. \n\nWDH and Bona looked so good together in their recent Marie Claire photoshoot.",

It's hard, if not impossible, to save a bad script, even if of the other parties involved are doing their best. In this case, I found that Detective K movie series from this screenwriter were fun. Besides, the story seems interesting. So, I am having my hopes up!",

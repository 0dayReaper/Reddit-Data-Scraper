His childhood was filled with abuse, bullying, and a sense of loss -- I imagine it'd be really hard to let go of that level of resentment and anger. He lost his father and his future was set after what the powerful folks did to his family. I can understand him wanting to (1) get revenge to avenge himself and his family, and (2) wanting them to feel powerless. Given what they've shown us about Kang Ho thus far, it seems to me like he didn't know she was pregnant before making his decision AND he knows enough about the villains to know that they'd come for Mijoo if he stayed with her. But you're right that it does suck to be Mijoo in this situation, especially given the sacrifices she made.",

Difficult circumstances can harden you, even if you know you could have done things differently. If you have so many problems and they threaten your very basic needs, you might end up saying things you will regret in the future. I think the drama portrays this very well. Young Soon loves her son, but her desperation to give him a better life ruined their relationship. Kang Ho is also no saint, we saw the people whose lives he ruined. But that's the irony of the drama- that mother and son can only reconcile when they've lost everything. Young Soon is too overwhelmed now by everything, obviously she's tired. I'm interested to see how the writers will handle their storylines",

I think the level of trauma and loss she has suffered has made her become really controlling in order to feel safe. It shows how trauma is transmitted from generation to generation through coping mechanisms that have negative side effects on the kids. This context makes me able to feel compassionate toward her character even when she is being abusive.  I think it's realistic. People are not good or bad - they are both.",

Remember the story that pigs are thought to be dirty when in reality they are animals who sleep in clean spaces, but use mud to cool down and chase away parasites. However, when humans enclosed them in tiny spaces, they were forced to bathe in their own excrements.\n\nI see it as a clever allegory for Young-Soon's story. Even the kindest people can do questionable things when put into an impossible situation.",

They tend to not break character across the duration of entire shoot! I have seen anecdotes that he went through similar process for 18 again!",

Along the way, Mi-joo earned the most well-deserved of business opportunities.\n* Following on from the previous point, it's the caliber of the acting by the three leads that really elevates this drama. You feel every emotion they convey, from joy, regret and pain, and you feel it *deeply*.\n* I'm not a big fan of the composer. Villagers turning against one of their own is to be expected in a drama like this. But while almost all of the other elements of the drama feel natural and unforced, this feels decidedly forced.\n* It was nice to see Sam-sik get more screen time in this episode. He's been underutilized so far, and it will be interesting to see how another reconciliatory relationship with Kang-ho develops.\n* I liked how the village chief's wife was given the opportunity to speak the truth at an appropriate moment for a change.\n* Young-soon's diagnosis had been signposted, but it felt unbearable that one family should have to endure this amount of pain and suffering.",

I like this middle area they\u2019re in where people\u2019s opinions of their decisions lies within their individual moral compasses. I found myself getting so annoyed at the fact that I hated the mom but could also understand her and how I truly felt for kang ho but was disappointed in his decisions and I just love how realistic it all is",

It's a cliche, but they are just *perfect* together.\n* \"So if you don't want to die... Get the porridge ready.\" Balancing heavy drama and quirky humor is no easy feat, but the distinguished cast of villagers allow it to be done so beautifully in this drama.\n* Wow, this gentleman from the Livestock division has an authoritative presence. He wouldn't look out of place as, say, a Crown Prince in a fantasy series...\n* \"No, dog.\" \"Yes, dawg, you're tough!\" Like I said, when this series goes the comedic route, it's hilarious.\n* The village chief's wife seems to have taken inspiration from *Joker* in tonight's episode.\n* All manner of chaos was unfolding in that cliffhanger final scene.\n* Ah! The song that played over the end credits (and in last episode's flashback scenes) is *the* next classic K-drama soundtrack song. It's not available yet, but what a gem it is.",

            "comment": "This is already my new fav drama that solved my kdrama drought. Lee Do-hyun and Ra Mi-ran are such powerhouses and the pillars of this drama. LDH's versatility is of a different league. The first few mins of today's episode made me almost cry tears of joy because of Kang-ho and Mi-joo's relationship. So much intimacy. I knew the breakup was inevitable but it was nevertheless heartbreaking. So I'm pretty sure now that Kang-ho &gt;!broke up with a plan in mind and didn't want to involve Mi-joo in it.!&lt; I'm still on the fence with the crime part of the drama tho. Until last week it was really bugging me that neither Woo-byeok nor Oh Tae-soo &gt;!wanted to know about Kang-ho's wherabouts and this episode cleared that doubt for me.!&lt; But the scene with Tae-soo and his daughter was quite confusing. &gt;!He showed the footage of Kang-ho murdering the woman as a proof and then he convinced the daughter by confessing about his part in Kang-ho's dad's murder.!&lt; So the question is did she or did she not buy his video proof. The crime scenes are quite sloppy imo.\n\nAnd I'm now heartbroken with the plot of &gt;!Young-soon being sick.!&lt; Should be brace ourselves for some tragedy? This drama has made me shed enough tears already. All I want is a completely recovered Kang-ho making his mom proud by being a good prosecutor and live a happy life with her and Mi-joo and the cute kids. Is it too much to ask??\n\nP.S. Kang-ho's dog being named Yellow is definitely a callback to his relationship with Mi-joo cause yellow being significant throughout their relationship. So I'm curious about the dog's backstory and also hoping that Mijoo knows about it too",

            "comment": "**Episode 5 and 6**\n\nThe parts that hit with this show really hit! I thin Ahn Eun Jin is doing a fantastic job of portraying her internal struggles, the quiet frustration, the anger, the love vs her inherent kind heart. We obviously are learning about the past bit by bit but her character is a good representation of how she keeps trying and hoping for a better future no matter the number of times life throws her curveballs, much in contrast to some of the others on the show. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s deliberate but I think it\u2019s harder to remain kind in an unfair world. \n\nKang Ho and his mom, and their arc ofcourse continues to be compelling, although the show really decided to pile everything imaginable onto them which coupled with the villains and the other ancillary characters, as others have pointed out, is making them dangerously skirt towards a makjang.\n\nThe writers are trying hard to make the villagers ensemble be like those from other iconic shows but to be honest it\u2019s getting a tad bit tiring. They\u2019re a bit caricature-ish which I think adds to this pendulum on genres within an episode. The annoying singer dude is so awful and so darn unnecessary! Also the amount of \u201ccasual\u201d domestic violence in the show can really get jarring sometimes especially with Sam Shik and his family. I also felt horrible for him in the flashback yet at the same time the show isn\u2019t shy from showing us that Sam Shik has seemingly gotten in his own way throughout his life. It really helps drive home the point that we are products of our circumstances and how we choose to deal with them. \n\nThe two gangsters are adorable and I too want them &gt;!to buy that piece of land and start farming and just decide to protect this community!&lt;. \n\nAgain, I see why this is a 14 episode show. If they trimmed some of the fat could\u2019ve been a crisp 12 episodes too but I will take as many Kang Ho and Mi Joo flashbacks they have to offer because they have no business being this adorable together. Poor Mi Joo.",

Although Kang Ho was portrayed as an asshole as a prosecutor I didn't think that a kdrama writer would actually have the balls to make their character such an asshole. We're probably gonna get a redemption scene where his POV is explained but it's still so hard to stomach. Poor sang sik, mans has such a hard life. I really love this show though it's so hard to make you want to root for a character who's so thoroughly dislikeable.",

            "comment": "So I have a few working theories about how the plot is going to pan out, just bear with me.\r\n\n1) Painting Kang Ho as corrupt / evil bad - I think this is going to be one of those narratives where we've been shown the 'outside' part of the story where all his 'evil' behaviours will be redeemed in flashbacks as part of the plan. Not helping his friend avoid incarceration, severing ties with his mother, leaving Mi Joo - probably his intention was to ostentatiously distance himself from any of his relations so that he won't have any visible weak points. Woman and child he apparently killed? I bet they are waiting somewhere to be a part of big reveal of the revenge plan and will come to rescue when the bad guys will try to frame Kang Ho for something. Mark my words.\r\n\n2) Mi Joo knows why Kang Ho left her and what probably suspects or is aware of details of his revenge plans. She knew what was coming - it was seen in her expression when Kang Ho was preventing her from seeing what he was working on, wording of their breakup was exceptionally vague (and probably full of hidden meanings). She let him go and &gt;!if the kids are in fact his, she first didn't let him know out of spite, but then probably realized he is already on his revenge path and decided to make up the story about some anonymous father to protect her kids from the possible fallout of Kang Ho's avenger-style crusade.!&lt;\r\n\n3) Even though it was the part of his 'leave everyone behind so they don't get hurt' agenda, cutting off his mother seems, at least partially, genuine. He got seriously hurt and burned there. On one hand it was kathartic to see a well adjusted adult sever ties with abusive elders (it is actually sickening how much children can stomach in kdramas from abusive or shameless parents), but then you realise that the rough upbringing steered him towards a revenge path and bubble bursts, because you can loose your mommy, but not your mommy issues.\r\n\n4) I bet that somewhere near the end of the series it will be shown that he regained memories earlier than it was suggested but pretended to still have amnesia to spend time with Mi Joo and the kids AND because it is his only shield from big bad guys while physically incapacitated. Still tried to kill him, but may be not so adamant on doing this while he does not remember (and he may plot his revenge in peace).\n\nThanks for attention, that's the end of my ted talk.",

And that he's not necessarily \\~corrupt.!&lt;\n\nI agree though. I've seen a lot of interesting takes on-line about some of her behavior. This very thread had a long discussion about her methods to get him to eat. I saw it at abusive, but I saw so many comments on tiktok about how hard and brave it was for her to deny her disabled son food. I like that the writer is forcing us into this complexity.",

It cannot be played for laughs for one thing and it definitely canNOT be portrayed as justifiable in any way, shape or form\n\nIf the mother doesn't change her ways and admit out loud to her son that she mistreated him, even when he was sick and vulnerable, this would not be a healing drama. It would be a show about a bad mother being good because the methods she used, while terrible, were acceptable because her son had a life altering injury and came out of it a better person.

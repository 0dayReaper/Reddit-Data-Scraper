            "comment": "I watched my first BL drama yesterday\u2014The Eighth Sense. I\u2019ve been watching kdramas for over two years now, and this series was so different! It looked like an indie film. The acting is done so well and felt natural, and I liked that there were many things that were unsaid and not shown. The soundtrack was perfect. When a song by one of my favorite artists came on during a pivotal scene, I knew this show was going to be one of my all-time favorites. This is the kind of drama my teenager (who is not into k content) would love. Are there any other series with similar vibes? Does not matter if it\u2019s BL or not.",

I can\u2019t really think of any kdrama that has the same indie film vibe\u2026 Actually, I\u2019d probably say Nevertheless is the closest thing I\u2019ve seen. It got mixed responses from viewers haha, but I love that show so much. The cinematography and the use of the soundtrack and colors is really well done. And like The Eighth Sense, it really focused on the main characters and their life in college, you don\u2019t need the whole context of their family or.. unnecessary villain characters\u2014it\u2019s just about a group of art students and their relationships, and I love them. \n\nAlso, a totally different tone, but Weak Hero Class 1 gave me indie movie vibes. The soundtrack, the script sounding more natural\u2014it felt more like the real word as opposed to sugar-coated dramaland. Very engaging story-telling. But it\u2019s the relationship between Yeon Sieun and Ahn Suho that is so magnetic and makes the show so great.",

But the story then is very different.\n\nMacbeth is hard because the main characters are \"villains\" and it would go against a lot of the K-drama tropes. I was trying to figure out if there was a more modern chaebol drama maybe from the standpoint of Malcolm having to do with a murdered father and having to take down the murderers (Macbeth and Lady Macbeth), but I came up empty. I mean, there are a lot of revenge chaebol dramas, but nothing quite as emotionally complex.",

Like there won't be any sound in the drama but they will write (smacks lips thoughtfully) or something because they see it on screen. First stop projecting your interpretation of the emotions of the character into the subs, viewers can determine that themselves. Second describing stuff that isn't there in the audio is incredibly distracting.  \n\n\nThis also happens with constant sub descriptions of music which often aren't even true. There will be some slow synth strings groove playing and they'll say \"cheerful pop music playing\" then 5 seconds later \"cheerful pop music continues.\" Who is this for? Not a blind person as they can hear the music. Not a deaf person as this misrepresents the intended mood of the scene and knowing whether or not music continues is totally pointless information. I start wondering if the people they hire to do these are paid by the word.",

Same with the banmal/jondaemal talks, you could just say 'why are you using casual speech (in Korean, casual speech is often used for younger/same age people and close friends)'.

Foremost among these is (G)I-DLE -- their songs have too much rapping for me to listen to casually but their MVs can be so addicting. I'm still not at all over [Nxde](https://youtu.be/fCO7f0SmrDc) (honestly probably one of the *best* kpop MVs ever made in terms of visuals and messaging) and now loving [Allergy](https://youtu.be/XZaBkbvteBc) too which is bringing back memories of Avril Lavigne^(I feel old!).",

I really hope there\u2019s some character growth on Yumi\u2019s side - she seems a bit immature for 30, and the love cell is so naive and dramatic lol - I\u2019m like, am I too much a skeptic to watch this show?? Haha",

That plus the imo terrible US remake of My Fellow Citizens is making me want to have a discussion about why US kdrama remakes don't seem to do well, perhaps because US studios don't seem to understand why many Americans love them.",

I especially appreciate how creatively men dress in K-Dramas (and S. Korea too, I am guessing?). In North America my eyeballs rarely get to feast on such a bevvy of beautiful (long) sweaters and the COATS. Le ugh! They are excruciatingly pretty. Why can't shopping like this exist for us mortals? We seriously have to pause every other scene to fawn over Goblin's latest coat majesty!!!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Allegra and I\u2019m a  Master student in Media &amp; Creative Industries. For my master's thesis, I am researching how autistic women perceive the representation of autism on the series Extraordinary Attorney Woo. After seeing the series as a neurotypical, I became interested in understanding how autistic women relate to it, since few studies to date have interviewed autistic adults on their perspective on autistic representation and stereotypes.\n\nI am looking to interview, in the months of March and April of 2023, autistic women aged 20-35 who have seen the series for around 45-60 minutes (either online or offline), keeping anonymity on the publication of the research of course. I would like to talk about how you viewed the show, if you related to attorney Woo, if you felt ableist attitudes portrayed in the episodes, and if you feel autism has been represented differently in Extraordinary Attorney Woo than previous Netflix and media productions.\n\nAs the series made me reflect on various aspects of autism from a neurotypical point of view, I feel compelled to research and give space to the perspective of the autistic community.\n\nI would really appreciate your participation! Please leave a comment if you are interested and I will reach out to you.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

R/AutisminWomen as I said, this show was a huge topic of conversation over there for a while so you should easily find people willing/able to be interviewed.",

OP, you may want to consider some survey controls for that.\n\nrealistically the target pool of autistic women aged 20-25, who watched EAW to a level of completion sufficient to discuss the topics and also are accustomed to the kdrama format... it's going to be on the small side.\n\ngood luck, OP.",

Go Yo Han is a person who puts more value on his everyday duty of observing and protecting people on probation rather than having a stable job or a nice house. He finds pleasure in drinking cold beer and chatting with ex-convicts who he used to supervise.\n\n[Source](https://www.soompi.com/article/1571429wpp/yoon-bak-joins-chun-woo-hee-and-kim-dong-wook-in-new-revenge-drama)",

That Ji-Yu's presence helped Ki-Hoon get over his nerves, and their mutual realization of feelings deeper than just attraction wasn't well explained.  That they spent the night together first and then confessed to each other casually at the party made their relationship look less serious than it is.\n\nAll in all, a low-key end to a low-key show. It was cute and romantic, and little Ji-Yu had my heart \u2764\ufe0f  Just realized that he turned 20 recently, so must have been 19 when filming this. He is a talent to look out for!",

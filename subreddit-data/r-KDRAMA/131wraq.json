Dont even get me started with the cast. At first I was all for woo dohwan, now im all for bona lol\n\nEunsoo is now on my list of characters with the most tragic lives. Girlie literally lost her family and unknowingly got pimped out by the same dude who was responsible for her family\u2019s downfall. I hope she rises from this, but I have a feeling that she\u2019s gonna get d-worded.\n\nAlso, am I the only one who is getting kinda sus with the king? Idk, he has this final boss vibe to me. Or maybe i just have trust issues.",

Oof. That last scene...I had a lot of good will towards &gt;!Ji Sun up until this point but he's making it really hard!&lt; after episode 10. Him realizing he can &gt;!use his power to marry Yeon Ju if he wants to?!&lt; Woah...\n\nBut what exactly is &gt;!he playing at? What does he have to gain really?!&lt; I feel like there could be something else at play here. Because like his father said, the previous King (Yeon Ju's father) wanted this marriage precisely because it would mean Ji Sun would lose his official status and become 'merely the husband of a princess' thereby keeping his father's power in check. That's why his father wanted to break it off in the first place. So Ji Sun is &gt;!going against his father and making his family more powerless for a woman he knows doesn't love him back, and who was previously content to be a 'wildflower on the road' for?!&lt; Hm..........\n\n&gt;!I'd be surprised to see them making him a full on villain so I can't help but wonder if he and Yeon Ju are in cahoots or something.!&lt;\n\nSo much to worry about. I feel terrible for p&gt;!oor Eun Soo and cannot tell where this is heading or if she will be okay. Why hasn't she tried to find Han Su at all?!&lt; First all this &gt;!heartbreak with Yeon Ju!&lt;, and next he's going to &gt;!find out his sister has been essentially brainwashed by Minister Yoo and doing his bidding!&lt;? Rough turn after rough turn for our dear attorney.\n\nBona &gt;!broke my heart with her crying this weekend.!&lt; When she said she just &gt;!wants to be So Won forever!&lt;....oh poor girl \ud83d\ude22 I felt the absence of Lady Hong in these two episodes.",

Then it's two things, it's used against you as a weakness (eg. Nobles and even family members might pressure to denounce titles officially or unofficially shun them of some privileges) and it's a constant reminder/rift between them (these days sageuks brush over classism like it's nothing but that is possibly the biggest issue of them all).  \nThat's basically it.  \nBecause they're royal aka \"lawmakers\" there isn't a legal reason where it's not possible. It all depends on how much power can be used to \"get away\" with it (sometimes it's not even an issue politically but only that \"missed opportunity\"), so the most important thing is if the two are willing to start in the first place.",

No romance\n\nRomcom: wok of love - really funny at parts and he cooks. \n\nBromance where he plays the villain: good manager/chief Kim\n\nThere are tons of music videos/variety shows with him because of 2pm. \n\nMovie: twenty -also has Kim woo bin and kang ha neul. Pretty raunchy compared to kdramas but hilarious.\n\nThere are a couple more dramas with him in it, but I either can\u2019t find them or haven\u2019t completed watching it yet.\n\nEdit: movie title.",

So i\u2019m not worried at all about lack of chemistry in this drama, I\u2019m sure chemistry Will be awesomeee~! \n\nJust cuz This is a cliche storyline doesn\u2019t mean it has to be bad, as long as the acting/chemistry  is great and that a lot of heart has been put into making this drama it could turn out great \u2026 soooo excited for this one! \u2764\ufe0f",

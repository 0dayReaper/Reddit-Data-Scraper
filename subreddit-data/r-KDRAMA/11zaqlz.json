Starting from my late teen days when I had no self-control and used to binge 12+ hours a day for like three days straight to now when I can resolutely turn the screen off when bed time approaches (except for the rare binge). In the past few years, allowing a binge to eat into my sleep time only happens two or three times a year compared to when I just started watching and I was cutting into my sleep for a couple of hours nearly everyday.\n\nI don't know whether I should lament getting old or be proud of myself for taking care of myself better.\n\nI'm hoping that by the time I retire, my self-control will be at my best and I'll never let a drama get in the way of sleep.\n\nAll that to say, adequate sleep is important for good health! Don't let dramas ruin your sleep!",

She prefers ones with a more comic tone.\n\nI haven't read **Cold Sands** yet, sounds more tragic than what I'd usually read. I've been cycling through a bunch of entertainment industry as backdrop webnovels lately because they've been hilarious, especially when it comes to the simulated weibo comments.

Tried **The One and Only** - the first two episodes kept my interest, has an intriguing mix of hospice residents and murder! If this too does not work, back to old school and give Mask a try. Melos are my favourite genre but finding the right one takes a whole lot of trial!!",

I was disappointed in the end until the veeeerrry last scene and it saved it for me.\n\nWhile waiting for new episodes of other shows I'm watching I picked up **Sh\\*\\*ting Stars** because I liked Kim Young Dae in **Forbidden Marriage** and it's different than what I thought but I'm really liking it!  KYD is making me laugh out loud which is rare for me and he looks older in this drama to me for some reason (maybe the low body fat?) and so I was surprised to learn he was in his 20s even though it's usually the opposite.  His range is really good.",

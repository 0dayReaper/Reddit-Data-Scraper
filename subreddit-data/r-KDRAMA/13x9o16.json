I hope this is the best place to ask this\n\nI\u2019ve recently watched a lot of media like Mother, taxi driver s2, Hope, silenced etc in the last month that obviously showcase incredibly talented young child actors and actresses who do a phenomenal job portraying very difficult but real life occurrences. \n\nMy question is **does anyone know if the children that do portray such intense and difficult roles have some sort of support off the set for what they are filming**? As I said they do such an incredible job bringing the stories to life but it breaks my heart to think about even though they are playing a \u201ccharacter\u201d in a sense they would still be exposed to certain aspects of the role in order to portray that! \nI know they probably do have some guidelines for their safety but just wanted to know if anyone knew more about what that involves for them?",

There's stories of adult actors getting IVs on set so they can keep shooting for insanely long hours. I don't know if Korea has legal protections for minors on sets or standards for emotional support during filming. I do know those protections don't exist in the Kpop industry and some very young minors are being subjected to terrible working conditions and abuse. Even outside of entertainment the work culture of Korea is problematic and physical abuse of employees by their bosses is common. So I'm not feeling reassured that the child actors on sets are getting the support they need.",

My first thought was of My Liberation Notes and Mr Gu's floor of bottles.  I don't know if that was an intentional reference. I've only watched about 40 dramas so far and that was not a common occurrence to have the floor covered in soju bottles so much.\n\nI also tried watching Tomorrow and Rowoon's character was given a sweatshirt to wear, I laughed seeing it's AGUCCIM (meaning some kind of fish) but in the style of Gucci brand.  My first thought was of Crash Landing on You's Pyo Chi-Soo from Captain Ri's squad. I think he had a AGUCCIM shirt when they visited Seoul.

            "comment": "I\u2019m still deep in k-variety land with *Bloody Game 2* and *HyeMiLeeYeChaePa*. HMLYCP is just all sorts of fun and adorable and I have such a good time watching the girls have fun and bond. The kpop related quizzes/challenges are amazing and I wish they did more of them\n\nAs for *Bloody Game 2* \u2014 I find the games this season more fascinating *but* overall the participants less like-able/interesting. I was really relieved to see the tall guy being eliminated by the end of ep 10 because he had *way* overstayed in the show in my opinion. This show teaches me that I should never go on a game-play based survival show, I wouldn\u2019t survive a day and finish zero of those math-based games.\n\nThe only on-air drama I have on my watching list is **Queen of Masks** (8/16) which I\u2019m taking a break from because the subject matter and some of the dialogue and flashback scenes was starting to be a bit too overwhelming. The drama is so good though and I want to watch it badly but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a good enough mental space to watch it. \n\nThe rate at which I\u2019d started devouring k-variety shows was a red flag for me that I need to put the drama on pause. I\u2019m actually feeling pretty proud of myself for recognizing and heeding the signs. When I was younger, I\u2019ve definitely ignored such signs and kept going with dramas which would end up putting me in a pretty bad mental space for a while. \n\nSo unsolicited advice for other watchers, if a drama is becoming too much mentally/emotionally \u2014 it\u2019s always a good idea to pause it and put it on the back burner and return when you are in a better mental space/mood to continue with the drama. Especially for dramas that deal with sensitive subject matters.\n\nJudging by the amount of dramas I\u2019m not watching, I feel like I can maybe call this a \u2018slump\u2019 but it honestly doesn\u2019t feel like one from my perspective because there are dramas I definitely want to watch, I\u2019m just not watching them as part of self-care.\n\nAnyways, I need to look at the calendar and figure out around when to start **The Real Has Come!** so that I catch up around the time finale comes around. I feel like I should watch at least one family weekender this year. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I might be tempted into a rewatch of **Never Twice** \u2014 which funnily enough I\u2019d said I\u2019d never rewatch it when I first finished it but dunno why I\u2019ve been feeling tempted to watch again.",

The premise interests me so much because it\u2019s really up my alley so I just wanted to know your opinion on S1 (if you\u2019ve watched it)\n\nI totally recommend S1 of *Bloody Game*-- the set up was fun despite some of politicking and betrayal between players. I went into the show blind with regards to the contestants or the set up and found it very enjoyable so I don't want to 'spoil' anything about the set up but S1's set up felt very novel to me and in my opinion, made for great entertainment. I also thought the relationship dynamics were fascinating to witness (more so than S2), in part due to the set up.\n\nGame-wise though, S2 has the more innovative/complex/fancier games. Either way, if you like the premise of a games-based survival show, I think you'll enjoy both seasons.",

I  wasn't super keen on the early episodes but it got really good now.\n\nYesterday on a Radio 4 program I heard that Churchill was a believer in Eugenics. Which got me thinking some random thoughts. Churchill is of course best known for winning the war against the most infamous Eugenics-believer. So on this front the two of them held the same belief. That's interesting. Is that often the case in real life, do good and evil often have things in common which isn't always apparent? in the Harry Potter movies, HP and You know who has a few commonalities/connections. The whole thing about the second wizarding war was based on the idea of Eugenics.\n\nIn Star Wars the bad and the good guy not only had much in common but were essentially the same.",

However, like the Southern slaveholders, he also believed that Black peoole were inferior to white people. He just wanted slavery ended because it was threatening the unity of the states.\n\nAnother example is Charles Dickens. He is known for his sympathetic portrayals of the British working class. However, he also held very racist beliefs about Indian and Black people, which were common among the British of his day. \n\nI think there is lot more nuance in real life than there is in fiction. And often times, people hold both good and bad beliefs or do good things for the wrong reason or for their own self-interest. \n\nThere are many historic figures who are considered heroic for one reason or another but had the same racist, sexist and classist beliefs that were common place.",

There would certainly be those who hold other perspectives about his motivations and so on. \n\nAnother example is that terms like 'racist' are very fraught these days, with some very different interpretations of what they mean, and changes in meaning from what they have traditionally meant, or what they basically mean as a dictionary definition, not an ideological perspective. Racism, for example, means, as an objective term, to accord preference based on race. A lot more has been added on to this meaning by some groups/people to make it much more moralistic, and it's used as a slur, rather than an objective term. \n\nI'd say that there's a lot more nuance in life than often gets acknowledged in accusations and discussions in public currently. It's a very judgemental - very quickly and harshly judgemental - period. TV shows and movies often reflect this, but there are some that also reflect the nuance much better than people allow for in reality. It's actually one of the reasons I like K-Drama, because they do nuance so well.",

If you asked the Jewish refugees who were turned away and sent back to Nazi controlled areas they\u2019d say it was everybody.\n\nTo make it relevant to kdramas, although more Tale of the Nine Tailed 1938 than Joseon Attorney - Koreans at the time may have also said everybody, since the US covered up Japanese war crimes and gave safety to the Unit 731 perpetrators in exchange for the data from their human experiments.\n\nI hope you enjoy the last two episodes too, and I would be interested in your thoughts about the moral issues dealt with in the show.",

But then she was also pissed off enough to kill Mira and the captain on their wedding day? I\u2019d thought it was focused on Mira for ordering the execution but she seemed more angry at the captain, and for different reasons.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I\u2019be been going back and forth on whether Chansung is the thief or the captain and had finally settled on the thief, but then the cop showed up in episode ten and is explicitly shown to be the thief.

I would love some suggestions for things to watch. I don't have a genre preference, I just tend to like dramas that are intense and have strong writing.\n\nMy top  dramas are **My Lovely Sam Soon, My Mister, Coffee Prince, F4 Thailand, Move to Heaven, The Bad Kids (China),** and **The Smile Has Left Your Eyes**.\n\n[https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/lilili](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/lilili)",

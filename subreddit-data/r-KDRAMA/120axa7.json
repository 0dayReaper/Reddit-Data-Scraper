It's really his style of movie, not mine, but I've enjoyed the other three well enough with only minimal eye-covering &gt;!(stunts with pencils can fall out of fashion at any time and I will not miss them)!&lt;.  I am actually looking forward to Donnie Yen and Keanu Reeves on screen together. Spouse is so excited about it, though, that it's been a topic of conversation for several weeks.  I don't mind, because it's given me an opportunity to make up for all of the drama synopses and commentary that I've subjected him to over the years. \ud83d\ude01 It feels good to return the favor.  \n\nA reviewer mentioned at one point that *there's no shaky cam*!! It was such a relief to hear that. My last experience with shaky cam (**Kairos**) was probably the worst ever -- I was motion sick for hours after watching the first two episodes on a tiny screen. Theater screens are usually worse, so I had been trying to decide if I should take some Dramamine to the theater with me.\n\nEdit: punctuation is helpful.",

The ending was rushed but not bad, wish we got to see the faux band *Wild Animal* perform though. \n\nRewatched **Touch Your Heart**, it was as good as I remembered. Though I skipped a lot of scenes that didn't have our lead characters. \n\nThis past week I watched all of **True Beauty**, it was good. Glad I have seen most of the dramas it referenced (except the movie reference near the end of the series). Though I got SML syndrome real bad on this one, even though I watched it for Cha Eun-Woo.   \nGonna spend sometime in this subreddit &amp; try to choose what's next, wish me luck!",

I also find some scenes to be way overlit, it throws stark shadows and combined with the pink tone some scenes look positively weird [https://twitter.com/daebakpodcast1/status/1638725963759620096](https://twitter.com/daebakpodcast1/status/1638725963759620096)\n\nI don't think serious dramas need to be dark or blue. **Move to Heaven** was gorgeously lit and shot and not at all dark despite the sad scenes. But the intense pink filter for Call It Love takes me completely out of the drama. \n\nI have some other problems with the drama too like &gt;!the implausibility of the FL getting caught stalking the ML and not getting fired or having the police called on her. Same with the scene where she gets caught in his office early in the morning. No way the office manager wouldn't fire her since she's a temporary employee.!&lt; Anyway, this drama is clearly not for me but it's too bad because I can see they are going for a My Mister vibe and I loved that drama but this one is a miss",

I didn't track my blood pressure while watching (probably a good thing) but I'm also setting a rule for myself that I am never watching more than two episodes of a daily drama per day *ever again*.\n\nAs the drama is more (in)famous for its makjang-ness I went into it with minimal expectations of seeing something profound in the drama yet I found myself pretty surprised at a few elements of the story that would fit right at home in a more serious contemplative social critique type of drama. So the drama definitely surprised me with some of its social commentary aspects.\n\nMost of all, the drama is definitely a product of its time and portrays things that wouldn't be possible if the timeline was moved earlier by a decade or later by a decade. I think it really captures the zeitgeist of its time in a fascinating way.\n\nI really enjoyed it (not surprising given my sweet-tooth for makjang dramas) but I love it more for making me contemplate about certain social issues far beyond my expectations. It's not a drama I'd necessarily recommend to everyone but I do think it is a seminal work that is often not appreciated as fully as it can be due to its makjang veneer.",

I think she will make a nice pairing with Lee Do Hyun. \n\nI kind of want to force myself to watch shows on Viki in the next month whilst I don't have Netflix.",

            "comment": "With **Dream High** getting a musical adaption, it made me nostalgic and I watched some clips of the kdrama again. \n\nCheesy-ness aside, it got me thinking about how we haven't really gotten a popular music related show lately. Of course, the **Sound of Magic** happened, but it didn't really get that much hype (expect in India, it was so popular there Koreans made memes about it lol).\n\nThe popularity of Dream High is definitely because almost all of the cast are idols (which also carries over to other related shows like **You're Beautiful**) but I wish we could have something like that again. Like even if it's just a web series, what I wouldn't give to have an actor singing some Aliee song during an angsty break-up. Or maybe have some of the MLs dance to 2PM to flirt. \n\nI loved that one scene in **Work Now, Drink Later** where the girls danced 2nd gen songs and became friends, and I just want more of that \ud83d\ude2d",

Just finished Kokdu, which was the first drama in years that I continued to watch as the episodes were being released as I usually wait until dramas are fully released before I start watching them. But the first episode really hooked me, so I couldn't resist.\n\nAnyway, as I'm watching the last 2 episodes (I don't want to spoil anything), &gt;!&gt;! there was a moment that reminded me of something else, and I can't place it where it's from. It's might be from an American movie or tv show. The situation is a guy saying to his girl, \"Worth it,\" in a low, almost whispering voice. The context is him having had to go through something in order to be with her, I think. !&lt;!&lt; I remember thinking how it was short but so impactful an expression of his feelings in the moment.\n\nDoes that ring any bells for anyone what this might be?",

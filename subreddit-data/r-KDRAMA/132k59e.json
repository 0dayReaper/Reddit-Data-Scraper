The ending scene where she is trying to save Haesoo doesn't add up because PJH had her how did she end up with Dojin? I and thinking when she had her back turned he managed to kidnap her. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!My theory is maybe Dojin was in on it and he made a deal with Dojin to erase all the bad memories Haesoo had of him in exchange for his help and he told him where Haesoo was. The reason Sungchan isn't really appearing in the last episode suggests maybe he is the one in charge of the manipulation and is trying to make sure he doesn't get involved in any of this. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The problem though I can't see them being able to milk out another 16 episode season of this storyline. Unless there is another villain like PJH's mother was alive or maybe the absent father? Like who funded PJH throughout all of this and how did he get to where he is if he was just an orphan? To create a new identity for someone and all that plastic surgery and transportation to another country for surgery etc is expensive. Maybe we were misled to think that Kyojin's mother was the one handling all of PJH's money but in fact it was someone else that was never introduced to the story. Someone that had to stay hidden and the one who really wanted Hatch to accomplish their smart patch and memory chip technology. If someone like that existed then I think they could manage another season. Base it around the story of PJH spent the last few years changing his identity and rebuilding his progress with his newfound identity. Since he took Kyojin's identity it could be that he needed Hatch again to perfect the memory chip to have no side effects or ways to reverse the memory loss.!&lt;",

My favourite episodes were 13-16, &gt;!when San becomes king!&lt; and him and Dok Im have to grow up and make much more difficult decisions than they\u2019ve had to before. The fight they have in the library when &gt;!they have their first kiss and San angrily kicks out Dok Im from the palace!&lt; was messy, intense, and passionate. Loved it! \n\nI cried my eyes out from the end of episode 16 &gt;!when Dok Im waves goodbye to her friends as they leave the palace, feeling a sense of loss for the life she had to let go of in order to become a royal concubine!&lt; all through episode 17. It\u2019s heartbreaking that no one could have a happy ending, partly due to fate and partly due to one\u2019s own choices. I really mourned the loss of the life Dok Im could have had with her friends, with a bit more freedom to be her own person, even if it would have been at the expense of being with her beloved. I truly felt Dok Im\u2019s inability to give herself fully to San and let go of her life where she was slightly more independent of him, even after she &gt;!became his concubine!&lt;",

Cons are spoiler marked since they contain some commentary.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Shin Hye Sun\n* Shin Hye Sun acting like a guy with poor manners\n* Shin Hye Sun acting like a guy with poor manners trapped in a place where etiquette is everything.\n* Great romantic chemistry\n* Hilarious comedy. It's honestly such a trope for someone to pop back into the past but they really dug into the jokes for this one.\n* Good character development. It's cool to see the development of Jang So Hwan in Kim So Yong's body and how it turns out for both of them\n\n**Cons**\n\n* &gt;!It wasn't obvious if Kim So Yong was still alive or if Jang Bo Hwan had fully replaced her consciousness.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I assumed the real Kim So Yong was dead because Jang Bo Hwan said it himself. Although, I finally caught on that they were both inhabiting the body, with Jang So Hwan driving (speech, mannerisms, actions) and Kim So Yong being passive (emotions, morals). I wish they made it clearer.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* &gt;!More time spent in modern times!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I thought at least we'd spend more time in the modern era. Maybe Jang So Hwan flips back and forth between being in the queen's body and his own. I thought he'd have his own fight against the people who framed him. Understandable that they didn't go this direction though. !&lt;",

My grandmother was told by an Australian doctor to \" take your kids shoes of and let them run around bare foot \" because, as an immigrant , she found the \" no shoe \" thing very strange and uncouth.\n\nI always have had  really , really broad feet and most shoes don't fit me. \n\nFor these reasons I cringe everytime I see a guy or , less common, a girl put a shoe on someone they like romantically .

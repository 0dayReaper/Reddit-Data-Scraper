All of the teasers look hilarious and I gotta give mad props to the JTBC marketing team for the amount of content they've been putting out.\r\n\nI'm also counting on KTL to get me out of my avoidant kdrama slump. For the past few months I've been so wildly stressed out in my personal life that I couldn't even bear to see fictional characters going through hardships, therefore I just avoided distressful plotlines altogether. Brains are weird.\n\nAnd that's why even though I was impressed by the first couple episodes of **The Good Bad Mother**, I couldn't bring myself to keep watching it. Like, we can't ALL be miserable!",

I initially dropped it around episode 3 cause I lost interest in the leads. Still feel the same way \ud83d\ude05 but I do like the teenage girl's storyline. \n\nI'm also restarting Somebody. I dropped it cause I wasn't sure about the tone and I'm iffy when it comes to the autistic representation. I don't understand why they made the FL on the spectrum. \n\nThe show is extremely dark but wonderfully artistic. Feels a bit like an indie American movie which is fine. \n\nKim Young Kwang is insanely versatile as an actor. This was the same man who was in Hello Me and Call It Love! I'm bumping him up to my Top 10 favorite Korean actors. Also Kim Yong Ji with short hair is a blessing. \n\nHope everyone is having a great Monday/Tuesday! Eat something delicious! Stay hydrated!

My tolerance for razors is low, so Somebody was really difficult for me and NGL, some of the imagery will never leave my brain in a bad way, but the whole series was really well acted. I just... wasn't sure what the point was at the end. I agree with you that giving the FL a diagnosis on the spectrum while ignoring the litany of other issues she seems to have felt a little simplistic.",

South Korea\u2019s job boards were filled with listings that instructed applicants to attach photographs until a 2019 law forbid it. Still, listings will use terms like neat and beautiful to describe ideal candidates, and mustaches and tattoos are explicitly prohibited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Consuming makeup and skin- care, as well as availing yourself of cosmetic services and procedures, is understood as a matter of self-respect, per- sonal management, and respect for the community. The surface of the body, writes University of Hawaii professor Sharon Heijin Lee, is \u201ca space of modernizing labor in and of itself, a site where buying and selling, loving and coercing, freedom and power all coalesce.\u201d15 The body is an instru- ment you take to work in order to earn a paycheck. It is also a worksite of its own, open 24/7. Whether it\u2019s work we do to our bodies or the work performed by our bodies, it\u2019s a whole lotta labor.",

Starts off sweet but short lived and by no means filling.\n\nIf I was in the writer's room, I would've kept the drama a slice of life story and focused on the teenagers. They were so much more compelling. Also delete the murder mystery. Keep the ML mute and without a sad back story. Have the FL gradually become a more vivacious person. She then discovers herself and her feelings for the ML through their shared love of running/books. I also would have made them secondary characters. \n\nI did however like the OST and the white dress Seolhyun wore in ep. 9/10 was lovely. So there's some positives.

Can definitely see myself rewatching it as a \"comfort drama.\" I appreciated the depictions of 20somethings struggling to find their purpose in life in the face of the daily grind of capitalism and rediscovering their lost dreams as an adult. I also liked the different types of relationships portrayed - moving from friends to lovers and some of the awkwardness that entails, the stagnation of a long-term relationship, the toxic ex that ML kept going back to in the past. All realistic!\n\nThe only two things I wasn't a big fan of were 1) &gt;!the Nam Il/landlord-as-mom subplot. It felt unnecessarily convoluted and IMO was still never fully explained. I think they either should've simplified it or left it out.!&lt; 2) I wasn't a big fan of how this drama approached disability.  It was very close to inspiration porn, and I'm always put off by that. &gt;!The sister's disability/illness felt like a plot device rather than making her a fully realized character and a human being with agency. Even the temporary deafness experienced by the ML was a bit off for me. I felt he did a great job of showing the panic anyone might feel that situation, because it was very sudden hearing loss. But I feel like that could've been done in a way that didn't portray deafness as the worst thing that can happen to someone. I don't know, it just felt a bit off to me. Having said that, it was such a small part of the drama, compared to the sister's illness/disability that drove a large part of ML's actions, so that is more significant to me. !&lt;",

            "comment": "I binged two short dramas this past weekend, a Taiwanese drama from 2023, **Copycat Killer**, and one from Japan called **Why Didn't I Tell You a Million Times?** (2023). Both are 10 episodes, and I watched on Netflix.\n\nI chose CK because I've adored Kang Ren Wu (or Chris Wu, I'm honestly not sure what's the most respectful? To use their Westernized name or not? I'm using the name in the credits, which is Kang Ren Wu) since I watched **The Perfect Match**. His acting style is so subtle and the swells of emotion in his characters build so expertly that I love watching him, even in throwaway shorts like **The Ghost Bride** (which was so fun!). In CK, he plays Guo Xiaoqi, another in a line of Hot Ethical Prosecutors^(TM,) with the added bonus that he's quite obviously an introvert. Introverts unite! Just... quietly, in the corner, watching everybody...\n\nGuo Xiaoqi has an ex-girlfriend who's a psychologist (Hu Yun Hui, played by Ko Chia Yen), and is coming back to Seoul to work after being \"banished\" for being too ethical (and possibly too hot, not sure). There's a spunky reporter played by Cammy Chiang, and a serial killer in a Noh mask. \n\nCK is not breaking any new ground, but it's a nice, tight drama (I wouldn't say Thriller because while it is thrilling in parts, it's... very calm, like its ML) and enjoyable for the interactions between actors. It manages to say a lot about the media influence on the legal system, and about malignant narcissism and even grooming disaffected youths into murder. I would recommend it as a short binge to palate cleanse before you dive into something with multiple seasons!\n\nWDITYAMT (I'm going to call it \"Million Times\" from here on out because dang) is also not breaking a ton of new ground. It's essentially a jdrama version of the movie *Ghost* with murder elements and crime procedurals, and quite a few quiet meditations on grief and loss.\n\nTakeru Satoh plays Naoki Torino, a Hot Grumpy Chef^(TM) who is planning to propose to his friends-to-lovers gf on her birthday. Yui Soma (Mao Inoue) is a hairdresser and the two met as teens in a foster home that's like a farm and the foster parents are wonderful. The two childhood friends meet randomly in their 30s when Yui tastes Naoki's famous \"Hamburg steak\"(which looks a lot like the American TV dinner mainstay, Salisbury steak, and appears in nearly every episode). They are really an adorable couple, which makes Naoki's waking up as a ghost on the evening of Yui's birthday even more heartbreaking.\n\nKen'ichi Matsuyama plays Yuzuru Uozumi, a detective who happens to be able to see spirits, as can his older sister. Naoki's ghost and Uozumi have a wonderful buddy comedy vibe and the whole series is very bittersweet. I especially enjoyed that the love triangle gets noped away by the FL:  &gt;!When Naoki suggests to Yui that Uozumi would be a good partner to her since he's alive, Yui tells him she'll take care of her own post-grief love life thank you very much! He doesn't get to hand her off!!&lt;\n\nBoth short dramas are nice and bite-sized for bingeing, finding that sweet spot between too much going on for a movie and not enough going on for 16 episodes.\n\nI'm off to see if I can sustain interest in a 50-episode cdrama!",

Kinda sad the episode threads aren't super active bc this is a really good drama. \n\n\nFirstly, the absolutely insane choices these women have been making rather than just y'know, simply talking to each other, are blowing my mind. Literally just talk to each other and be honest and this mega creepshow will not have so much power. So much idiocy, also stop telling him your plans to his face. \n\n\nSo glad we have 4 FL and we get all this fashion. Am I the only one obsessed with YuNa's tap/faucet buttons? Cannot get enough, although the sparkly skirts and victorian tops Jae-yi are wearing look slightly weird.\n\n\nPlease tell me Leo is universally loved? He's such a cute, puppy-energy househusband, I was happy he was honest and immediately teamed up with Jae-yi. \n\n\nHonestly hoping the rest and the end are as good as the episodes I've seen!",

At the start I worried she'd married a user and have been delighted to see what a loyal husband he is.\n\nThe fashion is fun.  I've been disappointed in the ultra conservative fashion choices for Jae Yi (with the exception of the fabulous  ultra-short dress she wore early on for her visit to the club bar) and Joo Yung and then remind myself that they are both in conservative professions as a lawyer and the head of a foundation.\n\nEditing to add I have loved Jae Yi's long sheer skirts with the dark jackets, like these two:  [https://www.instagram.com/p/CslSoMXyj6n/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CslSoMXyj6n/)[https://www.instagram.com/p/CslSoMXyj6n/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CslSoMXyj6n/)   \n\nYu Na's pearl-encrusted collar jacket was a favorite of mine.",

I was so mad when her mom and friend were like \"marrying him was a mistake, you could've done better\" no way, he is a delight.\n\n\nThe pearl collar jacket is gorgeous! I think she has the best fashion followed by Hae-mi. Agree on the more boring choices for the other two, such a waste of that amazing walk-in wardrobe and the wall of bags. The all white/cream outfits are beautiful but stress me out, how does she keep them so pristine? Her wedding gown was overly modest-handmaid's tale vibes, thankfully the reception gown was better. \n\n\nAlso I kinda hate Yu Jeong at this point because she has truly the worst taste in men and is behaving like such an idiot. I do have some sympathy for her but she is low key irritating me.",

That is one wicked dude they have to take care down.\n\nThe FL is going to need some major psychiatric work for all the trauma she has suffered. \n\nIt appears that not many are watching this if one can go by the comments.

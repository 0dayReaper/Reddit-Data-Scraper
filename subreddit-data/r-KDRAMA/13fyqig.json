It looks like they will use the remaining episodes for her to come to terms with the infidelity, put herself first and ask for a divorce.  There isn't enough time left for a romance and jumping into one right after a divorce would be a bad look.  \n\nI think the role of Doctor Roy is to be an ally, someone who advocates for her,  and to show her that there might be life after divorce.  He is also there to show Professor Seo that other men might be interested in his wife and change his perspective.  Too little too late (I hope).\n\nThe kids, would rather not see her divorce, and that's normal. Kids rarely want to see their parents divorce, unless the relationship is absolutely toxic.  The son would just like for his father to give up his mistress and reconcile.  The daughter's opinion we have not seen yet.",

Even her very supportive and loving mother is telling her to stay in a loveless marriage. But the show at the same time undermined it: Jeong-suk saying that she would have been okay with just her mom, Seung-hi and her daughter's discussion and realization, and then finally the most important, Jeong-suk learning that the idea of staying for the children isn't exactly gonna work when there's another child involved, who is getting hurt by her staying. I think she also needed to hear So-ra's straight forwardness and finally just let go of trying to keep up her image and \"perfect' family life. I still am convinced that she will end up divorcing In-ho.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also think she will have something with Roy in the future, even if it's just hinted at. He likes her and she's clearly interested in him at a subconscious level (that dream she had). I think she's just got a lot going on right now, and also it's probably hard for her to even admit to herself that he's interested in her. I mean, look at how her own husband's been treating her for years. Everyone keeps going on about what an amazing catch Roy is, why would she possibly believe a man like that would like her?!&lt;",

As hard it may seem, I really hope Dr. Cha divorces her husband, he doesn't deserve forgiveness or another chance at their relationship. She needs to get out of that family asap, it must be unbelievably suffocating, knowing that all this while the people you called family have been lying to you all this time. It must be the worst feeling ever.\n\nThe relationship between Dr. Roy and Dr. Cha might be left for viewers imagination at the seasons end I believe. She really needs some time alone to figure out herself and come to terms with what has happened so their ship will probably not sail anytime soon. \n\nProps to So-Ra, as expected she is a good one after all. Just wondering how it would affect their relationship when she also finds out that her boyfriend knew about the affair but didn't decide to say anything to his mother. I mean, would you get along with that kind of guy?",

What revenge can she wreak? \n\nThe other thing am confused by is how the mistress is not as wholly black and white as her husband. I keep feeling sorry for her. Just loneliness of a single mother of a certain age who doesn't have the confidence and inner strength to leave her boyfriend who clearly is now struggling to restore his marriage. I just feel that while I am not her, I understand her. And the scene with the mother in law was really sad, as was the scene where she rides in an ambulance to another hospital, so that her boyfriend can meet her there or be with her when she is sick. She truly is unsupported.\nI feel like the writers want us to take note and this might mean a redemption arc for the mistress and a softer handling of the conflict between FL and her... which is not so satisfying because I kind of want the FL to pack a punch and really teach everyone a lesson.",

Good job to the actors conveying this so well.\n\nI just can't help feeling sorry for the mistress.  Yeah, what she is doing isn't right, but at some level, I feel sad for her.  She is like a Dickens-like picture of a hungry street urchin looking through the glass at a family having a Thanksgiving feast.  Sure, she should have moved on long ago but the heart wants what the heart wants.  And she feels like Doctor Cha has the life she should have had.  This is ironic because Doctor Cha herself didn't like her previous life.  A classic example of how things always look better on the other side of the fence.\n\nThe kids' gifts were thoughtful.  &gt;!I especially like the doctor/nurse shoes with a little heart on them.!&lt;\n\nClassic K-Drama imagery.  &gt;!As the bracelet gift is about to be brought up the scene changes to a red light.!&lt;\n\nI like that she just didn't &gt;!explode but explored her options.

Yup, she is never coming back. MIL is more perceptive than she looks.  Too bad she never used this power for good!&lt; \n\nI loved the house visits.  I feel she is really in her element. Maybe she found her calling.\n\nIt's an interesting reversal &gt;!that Doctor Cha is having an \"outing\" with his wife, while the mistress stays behind.  Also interesting is that it's her turn to get hospitalized without any support from her significant other.!&lt;\n\nI guess this is the episode that is meant to make us feel sad for the mistress.  It's working. &gt;!I felt sad that the MIL refused to acknowledge her own granddaughter.!&lt;  \n\nLooks like the treatment by Prof. Seo was [Legit](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322150).

            "comment": "What an episode to watch on Mother's Day. It's almost like they timed this. (Korea doesn't have Mother's Day, but they have a Parents' Day which is celebrated on May 8th.) It just gave me a lot of food for thought.\n\n1. I love Sora. I love that she first felt embarrassed by how she treated Dr. Cha but ultimately decided, no, why should she? She is simply telling a junior that they made an error, or telling her that she doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. She has an abrasive, no-nonsense personality, and that's just who she is. It wouldn't be right for her to suddenly become nicer to someone just because she was her boyfriend's mother. (I want to point out that this isn't about whether I think Sora should be a nicer person in general, but just that she would treat anyone that way, so it would be inauthentic for her to treat Dr. Cha differently now that she knows Dr. Cha is her boyfriend's mother. Sorry if I wasn't clear!) So I love that Sora is looking out for Dr. Cha, but in her own way. Sometimes you need someone who has a tough personality to step in and make moves. Like Eun-seo, for example. It is refreshing that she is speaking up and telling truths and make people confront the situation, because her parents certainly never would have.\n2. I love the way it ended. Dr. Cha, aside from being a caring, positive person who sacrifices for others, is also someone who can also feel joy in the moment, even during the most devastating moment in her life. It is her big, open heart that makes it all possible, and I just love that about her.\n3. Finding out about the affair was crushing enough, and we knew that the other shoe would drop - the daughter. That was... whew. Wow. The betrayal.\n4. Dr. Seo (the husband) remains the most shameless, pathetic person ever. What is his redeeming quality? (And please, do not watch Ep.9 while eating. Ugh.)\n5. I ultimately feel NO sympathy for Dr. Choi (Seung-hee). It's one thing to have an affair with a married man, but having fantasies about birthday dinners with his mother is just delusional, when he clearly has no intention of leaving his wife. How do you even live this way? Anyway, the way she specifically aims to break up this marriage just makes her seem somehow more sinister. It's not just because she really loves him or she's lonely, it's that her life's goal is to get him to marry her. I don't know, I guess, as a woman, I just can't relate to anyone with this particular mindset.\n6. It was really tragic to see the two half-sisters fighting. These children are not at fault for the mess they've been put in. I just feel bad for both of them.\n7. She MUST divorce him. Even though her mother tells her now to forgive his faults, I have no doubt that once she learns everything, she will be the one dragging her daughter to divorce attorneys.\n\nAnyway, I do feel that this does make feel like it's a great show to watch on Mother's Day because it leads one to contemplate Dr. Cha's role as a mother. Does being a mother mean endlessly sacrificing one's self for the sake of her children? Or is it really better for her children to see her fight for her own desires and fulfillment? I really believe it's the latter, and we will see Dr. Cha finally embrace her own life and put herself first.\n\nSeeing her laugh in the rain was truly cathartic. It just made me think - none of this is her fault. She did her best to live the best life she could and do right by others. She was just dealt a breathtakingly painful blow, but it left me feeling no doubt that she will find a way to get past it and rise above it somehow. Other people did this to her, so let them bear the burden of the wrongs.\n\nLooking forward to next week.",

It fits right with her character \u2014 she\u2019s the typical, smart woman who fights for women.\n\nUhm JungHwa is killing it in every dramatic scene. I can feel how painful it is for her when she found out that the husband has not only been cheating on her for 3 years, but apparently 18 years. The most painful part of cheating is not thinking that your partner is having sex with someone but that you were betrayed, lied to, and made a fool for many years. That\u2019s why the longer that you know the affair is, the more painful it is.\n\nAnd OMG, Dr Roy is not hiding to JungMin or JeongSuk what he feels. He just told JungMin that &gt;!he is interested in his mother, but of course, friends for now. And he also told JeongSuk that he hopes her door will be open for him after she\u2019s moved on.!&lt; If they don\u2019t end up together after this clear confessions by Dr. Roy, I\u2019d hate the writers.

            "comment": "Thoughts on Chapter Nine:  \nI'm confused. On the one hand, I appreciate that they showed Doctor Cha's processing what she found out and you can really see her pain throughout the episode. She also took steps: she went to consult a lawyer and left the house.  \nOn the other hand, the whole family thing is very strange to me: think that within two days there is both the cake incident and the mother announces that she is leaving the house and moving to the dormitory. It seems strange to me that no one in the family says to themselves - \"it's obvious that she found out about the affair.\" I don't buy it as a viewer that everyone continues to behave as usual.  \nIn addition, the family really disappoints me. It is one thing if they would see their mother happy and hide the affair from her ( I don't like it but I can understand it at list) , but it is very clear to the children that their parents' marriage is not good and they fully see that the mother is in pain and suffering. (the crying on the way home, etc.). So who do they think they are doing a favor here by not telling her? only for themselves. And that is very unfortunate.  \nIn terms of support for Doctor Cha: I really miss a scene of her with her friend where she shares the whole discovery and we see how the friend supports her. I just can't believe there wasn't such a scene.  \n\n\nRegarding Doctor Roy. I'm starting to feel that maybe they won't be a couple in the end and it kinda sucks.  \nFor me, the best result will be a time jump at the end of the series where you see them together (say after two years like they did in the crash course in romance).  \nThis will be the ideal result for me.",

I think it also brought in another complexity to his character in that hilarious scene- treating the older patient by doing the worst thing we all could imagine - but you have to admit , he performed it competently and with professionalism. Like someone else pointed out- his medical specialty being the anus fits perfectly with his character. Lol\n Whether or not a romance will happen - I wish they would develop Roy\u2019s character more so we know him not only by his actions with Dr Cha but as an individual person.",

Yes she's rude and abrasive but as a character I thought she was an interesting contrast to Dr. Cha.  I never expected her to suddenly cower in front of Dr. Cha after learning her true identity bc that would be so out of character; plus I don't actually think she has anything to be ashamed of. I mean yes she could be more kind/respectful in general but at least she's equally harsh towards everyone. Being her bf's mom doesn't mean So-ra should now have double standards (I mean remember how rude she was to Jungmin lol). \n\nI am ELATED that they're friends now; I think she and Dr. Cha can learn a lot from each other (how to be compassionate/how to be a bad bitch).

Next episode I'm guessing from the preview Jeongsuk falls ill/ symptoms get worse \n\nEp. 10: Dang, I just know&gt;! I-rang injuring Eunseo is going to backfire greatly. I'm willing to bet when it gets out, she will be kicked out of the academy ie. threatening her art school dream, and Inho is going to have to make the 'decision' of which daughter's side he will be on.!&lt;\n\nLike other people are hinting at, this show is starting to look like either Roy is perpetually friend-zoned or it's a small whiff of romance at the end, which is realistic and all and i love platonic relationships but honestly I've been dying for a stereotypical happily ever after show atm so part of me hopes they just add a time skip a the end where they are married and the lot\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80",

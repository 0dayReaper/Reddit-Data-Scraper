That seemed tacked on!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I don\u2019t think Dan-Ah's pulling away from Young-Hwa was properly justified. It didn\u2019t seem like she liked her father that much. So why pull away because now he is dead and she got a promotion. She was presented as someone who just works and sees others as accessories to her life. But it did seem like she learned to care about Young-Hwa and when she started to pull away by citing the incoming responsibility of filling in her father's role, i was like...why? I think if there was a controversy that she was dating a student, that would've made more sense. They seemed to be kind of back together anyway.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!What Seon-Gyeom's father did, i feel like that should've made a bigger splash. After Ji-Woo said she was gonna divorce him over this, that divorce and his election loss kind of came and went and it seem like he even made some headway in apologizing for what he did in the end that was \"just\" shown to be the case.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The ending montage was a little too perfect, everyone got a happy ending-esque. For example, i am not sure about Tae-Woong, the boy was entirely made of searching for his sister's validation and how Dan-Ah repeatedly rejected her was very cruel. He didn\u2019t even feel like a character sometime. Even he seemed to have gotten a happy ending!&lt;\n\nOtherwise\n\nI enjoyed how this one focused on putting the viewer in a scene, in the interactions between the characters, while the storyline progresses kinda discreetly. That was done well. I enjoyed just being with the characters. It was refreshing.",

They clearly showed the relationship she shares with her father early on and for her to break up just coz she would get too busy did not seem convincing. I wish they showed more of how they get back together before the ending!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I think Tae-Woong was a very underdeveloped character in this drama, and though I loved the badass Dan-ah, I hated how she treated him when all he wanted was some affection!&lt;",

I must be bored for I finally looked up his age and other's and Omo he is only 44, two years senior to cho seung woo and jo Jong suk. Jjs looks younger and Csw's age was as expected, I kinda wished he took care of his beauty seriously like most other actors who look half their age. Even interesting, in God's gift 14 days, while watching the archived footage from 10+ years ago, the sidekicks joked he looked old even when he was young lol. Such a strange deviation from the usual Greek God/yeoppo comments!\n\nGong woo, Lee dong wook, ji sung, namgoon min are also around the same age and cha tae hyun is surprisingly only in his mid 40s. I thought he was older thanks to his acting choices. Its sad that none from this age group is interested in romcoms any more. Hope kdramaland do more middle-agey romcoms like ccir and give them more chances to flutter our hearts. \n\nI thought Jung Kyung ho was in the same age range of park seo joon and Lee min ho, he even looks younger than them and he is almost in his 40s! And Lee joongi is surprisingly 40 with that baby face! Ah I miss Lee joongi. \n\nMy mindless rambling is getting long lol. Anyway, do you guys know there is a Chinese adaptation of gaus electronics?

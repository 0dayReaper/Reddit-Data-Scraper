No. Unless you do it because you love the idols.\n\nThe sound was terrible (you can literally hear the background noise changing between takes), the editing left a lot to be desired and the acting was amateurish (understandable to a point, since these are all new actors, but still). The script was not that good either.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want a short, teenage love story, All That We Loved is way better in every single aspect.",

I just don't understand how, in this world, she would be able to &gt;!Survive year after year. When the curse first happened, with what money did she move out and rent an apartment? She basically became homeless... every year, does she get evicted and then move out? Did she switch jobs every year, or always worked at that convenience store? How did she live so isolated of the popular culture around her? Did she never make a social media account, even though smartphones and social media had already existed for a decade before the start of the series??!&lt;\n\nFor other parts of the plot.. &gt;!what was the witch doing at that resort place again? It's definitely not believable that our female lead was hired over the other clearly more qualified candidates. It is alsk not believable that her friend would take her at face value - I'd freak out if a stranger knew details about my childhood, especially if that stranger is 20 years younger!&lt;\n\n\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm overthinking it, but a longer series would have to address many of those things, and I just don't see them being explained well in the rules of their fantasy universe.",

While he fights against a devil, he gets transferred to a different world. Pontifex Rembrary then finds himself in a small dormitory and possesses the body of Woo Yeon Woo, who is a member of the unpopular idol group Wild Animal.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;The group has been together for 3 years, but they are on the verge of disbanding due to their lack of success. 9 hours later, Pontifex Rembrary is placed on a stage with Wild Animal for a live performance at a broadcasting station. When the music begins to play, Pontifex Rembrary, in Woo Yeon Woo\u2019s body, shouts out, \"I don't know how to dance.\" The live broadcast performance is a disaster, but it attracts the attention of people and the media.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;With his charms, including a confident attitude, Woo Yeon Woo, still possessed by Pontifex Rembrary's spirit, becomes popular, and so does his group Wild Animal. Pontifex Rembrary must now get used to life as a member of an idol group, and he faces various troubles, like dealing with weird religious groups and the devil.\n\n* **Streaming Sources:** [TVING](https://tving.com/), [Viki](https://viki.com/), [Viu](https://viu.com/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behavior will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

It\u2019s a bonus that they provide at least one laugh out loud moment every week and that the leads and Gam Jae and the rest of Wild Animal are very cute. There\u2019s not a lot of logic involved, but I think it has heart. They have some sweet messages they\u2019ve tried to convey about self-love, dealing with anxiety, etc etc. but they don\u2019t get too preachy about it. The villain is really there to provide us with a villain, so he doesn\u2019t really bother me. I just find him funny. He\u2019s like one of those people who thinks he\u2019s fully badass but really he just knows how to kill people. There\u2019s no great strategic mind at play here. \n\nI think Gam Jae was the star of Ep 10 for me. He had two most excellent lines &gt;!\u201dDal, would you consider becoming a grim reaper after you die?!&lt; and &gt;!\u201dMan you were right ultimately there was no reason to murder Dal, good call bro. Cheerio\u201d!&lt;. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI am a bit sad by the preview, that when we finally have the rest of Wild Animal onboard with Blueberry and being fond of him/showing him affection, the &gt;!leader is going to be put in a challenging situation to turn against him, when he\u2019s the one that\u2019s been the nicest all along!&lt; \ud83d\ude14",

It doesn't help that the show doesnt reveal his motive yet which makes every action he does annoying. On the other hand, I must applaud the wild animal members for not taking it out on rembrary for all the mess he \"caused\" this time. I dont know how they will tie the story as we have 3 episodes left. Hope rembrary regains his powers to &gt;!save the victims and sort it out with dal.!&lt;   \n\n\nSomeone made a theory back then that rembrary's powers depends on his fans' faith in him which kinda makes sense. We could see how his powers vanish whenever he lose his fans' suport so i wonder if he can do something about it.",

But so far i dont really hate it neither do i enjoy it much . The evil one behaves like a weirdo . Why wait ? Just kill him . There also seems to be reason behind it which im kinda curious abt tbh .\n\n\n Kim dal and blueberry romance is honestly really sweet i hope they get their happy ending.  Now that he finally decided to stay shit went down .\n\n\n And everything is mess now. Seems like from preview for episode 10 they gonna try to kill kim dal lol.\n \nNd he seems to have his powers from something else\ud83e\udd14\n\nSo far I'm enjoying it tho.",

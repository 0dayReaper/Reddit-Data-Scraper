I can't say I see the appeal of Lee Min Ho yet, maybe when the Kim Tan sweaters appear. But, Woo Bin's eyebrows! Also Rachel Yoo looking so familiar--the president of the Liberation Club! It is pretty cheesy.\n\n**Reborn Rich** (14/16) I loved Song Joong Ki in Vincenzo, but in this, I'm more feeling the performances of other actors. It's a little slow-paced, which I generally love, but I think all the finance/business stuff makes it a little tough for me. Interesting to watch this alongside another revenge drama and the start of the final season of Succession. \n\n**The Glory Part 2** (6/8) Just gleefully awaiting the culmination of Dong Eun's well laid plans! Very hard to watch at times (especially Part 1), but here for Dong Eun + sweet psycho getting their version of happiness. \n\nI finished **Would You Like a Cup of Coffee?** and it's one of my top dramas. A love letter to coffee, yes, but also the places where we feel at home/connected with others, especially poignant in the time of covid.",

He improved some in Faith. Saving Legend of the Blue Sea and Pachinko for later. \n\nPart of his appeal, for me, is that he always seems to be smirking behind everything like he\u2019s having a good time and getting away with something, plus his base personality has to have something to do with his costuming because he\u2019s always dressed differently from other characters in every drama. I think it\u2019s hilarious. The Kim Tan sweaters are the best. \n\nThere are definitely better looking and more fit-looking better skilled actors out there so it\u2019s some other quality that makes him interesting.",

Started watching the Thai version after hearing from many sources that it's the best among all and it totally was for me. It's a modern take on that old story - the flavour is the same but the characters seem like real people whose motivations make sense. Got makjangy in the later episodes but remained watchable. I have developed a crush on the actor who plays Ren (SML), he has one of the most ethereal faces I have ever seen! 8/10 Stars\n\n**Once Upon A Small Town** (12/12) - Loved the rural backdrop but didn't get the rural feels. I expected some community bonding but the only people in the village we saw more than once were the 3-4 ahjummas, the 2 police officers, and the 2 kids. The story revolved around the main couple and they were sweet but nothing special. Still a decent light watch. 6.5/10 Stars\n\n**All The Liquors** (8/8) - A cute little romcom that didn't quite manage to stick the landing. But the goofy antics of the little drunk had my heart. Would have been a solid 8 with a better ending but it's still watchable so it's a 7/10 for me.\n\n**Watching:-**\n\n**Call It Love** (10/16) - The writing isn't slacking off at all, and I hope it remains so till the end. I keep growing fond of all the characters with every episode. I hope Su-Ho isn't made out to be a jerk, I don't think he meant anything disrespectful on that phone call.\n\n(China) **Love Between Fairy and Devil** (14/36) - This one is on hold for now as 4 KBLs dropped together this month and I didn't get the time to return to it. But I'll pick this back up soon.\n \n(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (6/10) -   Just how many misfortunes are going to fall on Uea's head?! We better get a good payoff for sitting through this trauma porn.\n\n**A Shoulder To Cry On** (5/7) - This one makes my heart ache. Slow burn romance at its best! The OmegaX idols are acting like real actors,  and their chemistry is \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb  The cinematography is amazing. It's ending today and I'm not ready to say bye!\n\n**Our Dating Sim** (6/8) - Another one that's ending tomorrow and I'm not ready to say bye. This little BL came out of nowhere and slayed. Solid chemistry between the leads, well-written and well-acted. My only complaint is that it's so short!\n\n**Unintentional Love Story** (4/10) - This one has been a bit disappointing. The show is telling its story well but there's no chemistry between the leads. The second leads are much more interesting and I'm sticking around for them.",

I would love for it to end with them remaining FWB while Uea gets his s\\*\\*\\* together on his own. Then maybe a relationship.\n\nI'm curious what they're going to do with Middle Love since Jade is such a non-character. He's billed as being put-upon and ignored, but I'm not really seeing much of that. There's too little of him and what there is is mostly him being ridiculously stupid. I'm not sure I see a potential love story there, but who knows!",

Maybe if they'd written more of him into this story I would feel like he was more of a character and would be more excited about Middle Love.\n\nAs it is, all of the background characters feel the same - just popping in occasionally to say something marginally funny, then disappearing again for long stretches. Like, I legitimately keep forgetting characters exist and am surprised when they show up again, and I feel like Jade is falling into that too.The messed up shooting timeline and casting changes definitely affected the storyline for the worse.\n\nBut with that being said, I'm still watching and I'll still watch Middle Love because I like TutorYim's chemistry.",

I kind of liked though that what he did wasn't outrageously horrible or evil - kind of makes a point about how we all make mistakes, even the best of us, and also sometimes we don't realise how our words/actions that are seemingly harmless can affect other people.",

She had some good moments (eg. helping Pan-seok with the conman) but overall she was lacking agency or development. Now she is a very good character with clearcut motives and agency, a variety of connections to other characters and with that more developing relationships, and general development.\n\nAnother was the conmen/trickster factor. Wook was introduced as a grifter, but never really seemed to use those skills when investigating the ghosts. In this season they used a lot more trickery.\n\nIn general, I thought the writing and production was overall a bit more solid.",

And now I know the characters, which sure helps. I totally agree on Jingyan, Yujin and Jingrui! And Consort Jing is becoming amazing, as well. I love the colors: all the blues and purples.",

I\u2019m getting a little more anxious on what will happen though, when will the truth come out, how this will end, etc. \n\n**Empress Ki (14/51):** I like this one a lot!! Wish I was further ahead but I\u2019m still on schedule to finish by the end of the year. JCW\u2019s character is a pain though, I\u2019m so interested to see how he ends up\n\n**The Secret Romantic Guesthouse (4/18):** I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a while and I like it so far!! A little anxiety inducing with the way FL is in investigating (no secrecy or subtleness \ud83d\ude2d) but I think it\u2019s an interesting story and it has its charm \u263a\ufe0f\n\n**Age of Youth aka Hello My Twenties! (2/12):** in honor of recently exiting my teens I decided to watch this show!! I like how Eun Jae didn\u2019t stay a pushover for a long time. I also like how all the girls are different :)\n\n **Delivery Man (4/12):** Admittedly I don\u2019t really care about this show lol. I think I\u2019ll still try to finish it in the next few weeks but I won\u2019t be surprised if I decide to leave it alone either. I\u2019m also not the biggest fan of the FL, lots of whining and yelling. I\u2019m also a little scarred from the horrible **Check Out the Event** so I was skeptical of the actress herself to begin with \ud83d\ude2d\n\n**Recently Completed**\n\n**The Heavenly Idol:** the humor was done pretty well but the whole evil being and company storyline was a dragggg. So repetitive with the *same* back and forth with the *same* characters. And then episodes 10-12 decided to heavily focus on that storyline AND introduce new pieces to the story like the show wasn\u2019t about to end \ud83e\udd74 I wasn\u2019t a fan of that and looking back I feel like I spent the majority of my viewing time watching Rembrary fight for his life \ud83d\ude2d and they think they were slick by always having something happen when Wild Animal was supposed to perform but we saw right through that \ud83d\ude43 at the very least they could\u2019ve had one real performance like **So I Married the Anti Fan** did as this was a show about idols\u2026 Overall, I did look forward to watching for the first few weeks but the writer did too much with the evil being storyline for me. I enjoyed watching Kim Min Gyu, however I finished the show disappointed and a bit confused, 7.5/10",

            "comment": "Trying to decide on my next binge show now that I\u2019m done with The Glory. May be more Lee Do Hyun or Park Sung Hoon. I was already a huge Lee Do Hyun fan (18 Again is one of my favorites of all time) and have seen both in other things but they were both so so good in The Glory! The Good Bad Mother with LDH starts soon though so may hold off on anything with him.\n\nCurrent:\n\nA Shoulder To Cry On (5/7) \u2014 BL \u2014 Ends today. Sad to see it end but they have done well with this one. Solid storytelling and they will likely be decent actors one day as they aren\u2019t terrible now in basically their first job. Good addition to Korean BLs.\n\nCall it Love (12/16) \u2014 This slow melodrama is awesome. This week\u2019s episodes especially. The mains chemistry, the storytelling, everything. It\u2019s so slow and yet, that\u2019s totally fine. \n\nOur Dating Sim (6/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 another adorable BL couple ending today. Solid pacing, solid chemistry, solid storytelling, no fish kisses. This is another adorable and excellent addition to Korean BLs. I wish episodes weren\u2019t so short! And as an aside as a baby Korean language learner - I watched last weeks episodes and totally understood about 75%! This is a simple language show and I was blown away with how much I knew and understood. I will be watching this many more times.\n\nThe Real Has Come (2/50) - weekend family drama about a contract marriage. I don\u2019t usually watch these as they are too long and confusing. But 100% watching for Ahn Jae Hyun and to have filler on a trope I really enjoy. May drop it later, we shall see.\n\nUnconventional Love Story (4/10) \u2014 BL \u2014 I loved the manhwa! Stuck to the source material closely so far and I disagree there is no chemistry- there is chemistry. They are telling the story the way they are for a reason. This week\u2019s episodes should be really good if we hit what I think we will in the story. \n\nOn-hold/Dropped:\n\nThe Heavenly Idol (8/12) \u2014 Dropped. Just can\u2019t get into it again and story is so messy to me. I have heard not good things about the ending so I\u2019m done.\n\nJinny\u2019s Kitchen (2/10) \u2014 On-hold. Super entertaining but episodes are so long that I decided to watch when I can and not worry about catching up.\n\nCompleted:\n\nAll the Liquors \u2014 BL \u2014 Better than \"Individual Circumstances\" by a lot but still eh. Fish kisses in the end. Started so well too and ended with a whimper. \n\nThe Glory \u2014 The first 2 episodes hit like a truck and I needed a minute afterwards but the rest was binged in a day! The chemistry, the storytelling, this entire show was just *chef\u2019s kiss. So good. And if you\u2019re learning Korean at all this show is excellent for swearwords and insults! :D \n\nNon-Korean:\n\nA Boss and a Babe (4/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 they are adorable! This is like an onion, so many layers of meaning and we just keep going deeper. It seems to be fluff at first but definitely is not. The characters and storytelling are awesome. I hope this keeps up.\n\nBed Friend (6/10) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames are so freaking good. So good. Last week was sad. This week is going to be sadder still. But the intimacy and characters are just amazing. \n\nJack o\u2019Frost (5/6) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 they were off last week so time to finish it up. couple just breaks up when one has an accident and can\u2019t remember the other at all. So of course the one tries to win his partner back and make him fall in love again. Very cute and this couple does such a good job making sure you blame both of them for their issues. Can't wait to see how they solve this.",

I'm super impressed with the writing for such short episodes.\n\nUnintentional Love Story - I like this, but I feel like I don't think about it at all when it's not on air. \n\nA Shoulder to Cry On - I really wasn't sure after the first episode (bullying is not cute!) but I'm glad I stuck with it because the story is surprisingly full of depth and sweetness.\n\nHometown Cha Cha Cha - I'm halfway through and feeling ambivalent. I like some of the characters, but I feel like it's really harping on the \"small town folks are best\" which is a little annoying. I'm also hardcore rooting for the SML because I find the ML really dismissive of the FL (and everyone else.) I hope he gets better, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nStrong Woman Bo Dong Soon - finally getting some progress on the serial kidnapper subplot, but I'm still much more into it for the main couple. Also Gook Doo is legitimately the worst police officer ever. I see why he keeps getting in trouble and getting demoted.\n\nJack O'Frost (Jdrama) - this is so angsty and so good. I feel for both characters and I hope we get a satisfying ending, even if it's not happy.\n\nA Boss and a Babe (Thai drama) - started super sweet/cute and then got more depth. Really liking it so far and it's a nice way to start the weekend.\n\nBed Friend (Thai drama) - messy beyond all reason and the pacing is pretty bad, but I keep coming back for more.\n\nOn Hold:\n\nLove to Hate You - got three episodes in and stalled because I was watching other things. I'll come back to it later.\n\nCompleted:\nThe Warp Effect (Thai Drama) - really good multi-couple, time travel dramady. Iy's really more about the relationships, and how our actions affect others, than the time travel.\n\nKimi Wa Petto (Jdrama) - weird, but surprisingly heartfelt. As much about finding yourself as about romance. The age gap was a bit much at first (oddly the pet thing bugged me less) but I think they handled it well in the end.",

Everything in this series was done so beautifully! \n\nStalled out on **The Heavenly Idol** and **Kokdu.** I don't know if I'll finish those.

I've seen it already a few times, but it's always wonderful to rewatch a favorite with a friend. \n\nI'll continue **The Glory** so I can finish it, but I know I already ranted about violence, so I won't rant again. \n\nLooking forward to some of the new dramas coming out with some favorite actors and actresses! I hope **The Real** is good!",

The main trio is great, and the way things get concluded is satisfactory. I just wish I liked it more. It didn't really get to me from episode 1, and it struggled to do so throughout. Still, I give it a light recommendation. 5.5/10. I feel bad for this rating, but when a drama fails to get my love, I can't help but give a low rating.\n* \\*\\*Kokdu: Season of Deity (16/16)\\*\\* \u2014 Hated it. Even Kim Jung Hyun couldn't save it. 1/10. Let's move on.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* \\*\\*Taxi Driver 2 (10/16)\\*\\* \u2014 Still not to my liking, which sucks cause the first season is one of my favorite dramas (I choose to ignore the last few episodes and keep its dignity). I just want it to be over at this point. The ending of episode 10 almost made me laugh out loud, and it wasn't supposed to.\n* \\*\\*Love to Hate You (6/10)\\*\\* \u2014 Wasn't going to pick it up now, but a podcast I listen to (Pocha Playlist ... so fun, if you wanna check it out) picked it up, and I like watching things along with them. I hated the first episode, and the FL isn't to my liking. However, episode 2 and after are pretty good. It has funny moments, and they managed to get me to laugh out loud. Super entertaining. Although, I don't think I'll rate it very high because I don't particularly love the characters. We'll see what happens, though.\n* \\*\\*Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (3/16)\\*\\* \u2014 Started watching this with a Reddit friend because, I know it's a crime, but I've never seen Kim Seon Ho in anything. So far, I love this so much. I can tell it'll be a top drama. I love the characters, and I love the vibes. Such a fun watch. I can't believe I didn't pick it up when it aired.\n* \\*\\*Our Blooming Youth (16/20)\\*\\* \u2014 I can't believe I never mentioned here how much I love the 2ML and 2FL. I'm more interested in them, honestly. That's the one thing I like. Other than that, this drama feels too stretched out. Definitely didn't need 20 episodes.",

My Lady** (16/16) - this was a nice romcom, I loved the show's ceo to bits\r\n* **The Heavenly Idol** (12/12) - it kinda fell apart in the second half, but now it's over so yay\n* **100 Days My Prince** (16/16) - i binged this over the weekend, i wasn't planning on it, but it was so good i couldn't stop, and it had really good cliffhangers. also there is scene where &gt;!ml returns to being prince after experiencing the carefree life outside!&lt; and it just gave the same exquisite angst like Cold Sands &gt;!mc becoming emperor!&lt;. the ending is &gt;!a little too light and not very realistic!&lt;, but i really like the &gt;!main couple so i will give to them!&lt;, in short i'm happy",

            "comment": "Just finished **Bad Guys** and I like the different take on psychopathy. Usually \"psychos\" in dramas/movies are just portrayed as either evil cold killers or evil charming killers. The underlying message about the dangers of defining people by labels is well taken. The relationships between the 3 criminals was the best part. The only minus is how the one main female character is written and treated by the other male characters is verging on misogyny. \n\nI liked Park Hae Jin in Bad Guys so now currently watching **From Now on, Showtime**. Pretty good so far and most of the characters are likeable. I like the episodic cases but I see the bigger background case lurking and those always disappoint so we'll see how it holds up.\n\nI checked out **High Society** for Im Ji Yeon but had to drop it. The plot isn't that engaging and the 2 leads aren't interesting. Im Ji Yeon and Park Hyung Sik's characters were entertaining but not enough to keep me watching.\n\nWatching some of the older dramas, I'm struck by how far the cinematography has come in a few years.",

It's the ML's one man show due to mediocre writing in both a scattershot plot and yet another bubbly but no depth FL character for poor ISH. Wouldn't recommend, had some promise early but fades too early, 16 eps were just too much, a 7- for the cast's efforts.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **Delivery Man (9/12):** following this out of pure inertia, plot going to known ends with the usual bad guy with no motive, FL the only net positive. Nothing major to show for;\n\n\\- **Father is Strange (7/52):** in true morning drama fashion I'm having a tough time getting into it, so slow and many storylines and characters I can't bear to watch but the leading couple is interesting so I'll endure a bit more, though I might start skipping scenes altogether and just pick my plotlines.\n\nI really need to fit in a J-Dorama or two to cleanse my palate, hope there's a new gem out there.",

Unfortunately, my congresswoman doesn't support an assault weapons ban. I had to vote for her because her opponent was quite literally insane. Sigh, I'm exhausted by this country tbh and wish at times that we could leave but it is hard to leave family and emigrate to Canada or another place where I wouldn't be afraid to send my child to school or daycare.

I loved them both. MQ made me laugh out loud frequently and while I started watching it for Choi Jin-Hyuk (since he was soooo good in **Zombie Detective**) but he's pretty much a cameo. Shin Hye-sun was so good at channeling CJH's mannerisms in the beginning, and then subtly evolving into her own character, that I couldn't stop watching. Kim Jung-hyun as the ML was delightful and I will just say that the kissing was actually hot!\n\nGoing from MQ to FC:JMA really highlighted how bad some of the kissing scenes can be! I have nothing against Gong Seung-yeon's acting (she *made* **My Only Love Song** imo), OMG the face-mashing was lifeless. Add to that the fact that Kim Min-jae is a very subtle actor and it makes for distinct lack of chemistry. Seo Ji-hoon didn't get enough to do as the 2ML, and as much as I've come to adore Byeon Woo-seok after this, I don't adore him enough to finish watching **Record of Youth**.\n\nI would recommend both shows but **Mr. Queen** definitely made me fall in love with it. The little anachronisms (like inventing Joseon-era sexting) were hilarious and everyone is acting their heads off. Even the way CJH's male chef reacts to being in a woman's body *and* to falling in love with a man is well done as opposed to needlessly homophobic, at least imo.",

I am also intrigued by Park Min Young playing a different role than I am used to seeing her in.\n\nI've seen rave reviews about this drama since forever.  I'm about to finish episode 3, but it still has not hooked me.  \n\nI was wondering at which episode most of you hooked.",

Starting with that episode I think you start to see development in the leads\u2019 relationship. Episode 8 has one of the best, of many, moments of the show, and it\u2019s a really great stretch of episodes from there.",

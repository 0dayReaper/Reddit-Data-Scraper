I found it at the right time and this drama has been the only jipuragi for me in the past 2 months. I would forget everything for the 2.5 hours in the weekend and the cliff hangers kept me through the weekdays. This drama will be forever in my heart.",

I looked it up, vaisravana the king of the north is in some traditions is the patron of warriors. He rules the good and the evil. He is a God who manages Karmic debt. \nVicenzo is a monster, death follows him and yet you root for him. \nI realized that all 20 episodes are a meditation on Karma and redemption. Every character was given opportunities to repent, to change, to be humbled. Even Vicenzo. \nThis drama gave me alot to think about.",

That is a pretty common trope in Korean dramas involving wealthy families.\nAnd remember that in the beginning Hong Cha-Young is pretty corrupt. It is when Choi kills her father that she begins to care more about the people she represents. Her arc is that she recognizes the darkness in herself and comes to terms with it. \nAnd she knows that she is not a killer like Vicenzo. That is why they don't get a storybook ending.\nBut the buddist/Hindu reference really blew me away. It brought in universal themes and made the story make more sense. What great storytelling.",

She drinks a beer in the park by herself reminiscing of him.  She knows what type of person Vincenzo is, he's a villain who kills people, but she still can't wait to &gt;! finish work and hurry over to his island !&lt;.  The fucking end scene when they're&gt;! staring at each other so longingly !&lt; brought me to tears, like she doesn't want him &gt;! to go !&lt; but she's tryna be strong and I'm sure she feels like shit inside but AHHHH I'm dead\n\nSong Joong Ki said in an interview how much he grew to adore JYB and her character, he said if he had to pick just one character, he would pick Chayoung because hands down they have the most \"chemi\". And no doubt because that clearly translated on screen (and off as well). Feel like Jeon Yeo Been is so underrated just because she's not gorgeous in the korean beauty standard such as Suzy but she IS beautiful, plus her personality and acting are SOLID AF fuck I just love her.",

To me the women looked the same - thought it was just me but no, my SO (male - who I figured looked at the women more closely than I) said he can't tell them apart. I think it is the same in the US - there is that skinny, blonde type in every other movie/show and I can't tell THEM apart. It appears that in most countries, entertainment evolves so that women fit a tighter criteria and thus end up looking so much alike - once the 'type' is discovered they keep hiring women that fit. Some entertainment out of European countries, I think, features women that don't fit the mold.",

Mr Cho and Mr An are experts and will make sure they can meet their idol haha plus. \n\nVin and Cy were in a similar shade of black/navy unlike previously always it's always a stark black/white or light and dark. Previously I interpreted it as them being yin and yang soulmates, what one doesn\u2019t have the other has and vice versa but now they are one and the same shade, and a fulfiled one cause whatever the other lacked they have learnt by each other's love. \n\nWhile CY won\u2019t be as bloodthirsty as V, she is the same in wanting to see evil people who step on the innocents get a taste of their own medicine at all costs. They are just different shades of evil, CY ain\u2019t a saint she had a hand in&gt;! killing those ppl in the car !&lt;even V was shocked but she did it because of her compassion for the weak that were unjustly killed. \n\nThat\u2019s what the show is about rising up when the law fails, embracing your darkest side but also not forgetting about your capacity to love and care. Myung Hee and Han seok didn\u2019t have this they were just out to play god and that's why they &gt;!had to die painfully !&lt;in V\u2019s eyes.  \n\nV and CY are not of different worlds,  just that their world makes it harder for them to be together because of the lengths they are willing to go to see evil out. V was here for gold and he was tenacious about it but now the gold is CY awww HAHA&gt;!\"Villains don't break up because they are tenacious even when they love\" !&lt;That's not something I will say when I wanna break up.  So for me, it\u2019s just goodbye for now \ud83e\udd7a\n\n\\*editted for spoier tags",

It\u2019s a noun that describes the nostalgic and melancholic feeling of longing and missing someone or something you had. It can have sad or happy innuendos. It\u2019s a word on its own, it can transmit the feeling with the noun alone (like the word \u201clove\u201d) which makes the word more impactful rather than the verb \u201cto miss\u201d. It\u2019s said to have no literal translation in any language besides Portuguese but I\u2019ve never checked to see if that\u2019s true. I hope you get the gits of it!\n\nOut of curiosity... where did you hear/read that word? Did it appear on the show and I miss it? I saw someone talking about Saudade after watching CLOY and I was lost as well cause I swear I didn't hear the word at all. lol",

She can never really have the moments she had with Vin before. They can only see each other in rare events and secretly in his island. All she has physically in the present is a vineyard to feel closer to him and postcards and the lessons he taught her compared to back then they were always together (going shopping, having coffee and walks). There will always be an empty table at Jipuragi firm and the feeling of loss will always be there. But I also remember the very end she has a little smile as Vin was walking away, it was very complex them parting is painful but also reminder of the good that she has and had before and will have.",

They go back and forth for awhile of killing people and spare people because \u201cthey made a promise not kill people\u2026.\u201d \n\n2. So. Many. People. Died\u2026.. like I get they are supporting characters but it\u2019s weird that the villains just kill off characters because \u201cthey didn\u2019t side with us\u201d and it was mostly &gt;!The female second lead!&lt; doing the killings\u2026.. I really thought he/she was the chairman\u2026.\n\n3. The main antagonist is\u2026.useless, dare I say? Go back to number 2 for the reason\u2026.\n\n4. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but isn\u2019t this whole show supposed to be \u201c72 hours ago\u201d according to first episode? Either they went away from that part or i must of misread it??\n\nHere\u2019s what I loved about the show:\n\n1. The chemistry between the leads was just awwwwww\n\n2. The funny moments with the \u201ccorn salad\u201d family!!\n\nThere were moments that I truly loved and I did love this drama but IMO it\u2019s way too overhyped. I think the reason is because of the leads and it\u2019s about a Italian mafia (which he I feel like he knows way too much Korean lol)\n\nThose are my thoughts! Now don\u2019t hate me\u2026.",

But after the 4 ex-clients of Cha-young's dad were killed, she changed her mind and said promise was meant to be broken as necessary. That's when Vincenzo started to go full out on the villains. The sparing happened sometimes after that because Vin thought it's a hassle to kill every villains in their way. He was also willing to give them a chance to repent (Han Seo, Prosecutor Jung, etc). \n\n2. That's why she's one of worst monsters in the drama.\n\n3. Han Seok is used to having others clean up his mess, using his family's money and influence. That's why he only handled things himself when he ran out of options.\n\n4. I believe it was part of his dream, i.e. what he planned to do with the building, and the rest of the drama was what actually happened when he came to Korean.",

I feel so wrong to support a villain like Vincenzo, especially after his bloody revenge in ep 17 and 20, but I can't help sympathize with the writer's anger because it's frustrating to see real life villains always win (Samsung cases).",

            "comment": "&gt;\u201cMy Heart Is Beating\u201d is a new fantasy romance drama starring 2PM\u2019s Taecyeon as Seon Woo Hyul, who is half-human and half-vampire. Although he desperately wants to become human, he misses his chance because of one fateful day out of 100 years. He eventually winds up moving in together with Joo In Hae (Won Ji An), a cold-blooded woman who lacks humanity despite being fully human.\n\n[Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1586723wpp/watch-2pms-taecyeon-asks-can-you-feel-my-heart-beat-in-1st-teaser-for-new-vampire-drama)\n\nThe 2PM reference in this cracked me up so I just had to share it haha.",

Meanwhile I hope Lee Jung Jin ends up being one of the ultimate antagonists/baddies because I want to see his smirks.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm in girlcrush heaven with both Yoo Sun and Kim Sun Ah looking so gorgeous.\n\nHoping this will bring me back into watching on-airs!",

OJH just can't do baddies imo, annoying jerk yes (quite good at that) but not villains, on the other hand LJJ can be a great antagonist behind a smooth facade. &gt;!Considering he's a mysterious humble man marrying a rich woman and probably will end up getting her position, surely there's more to him.!&lt;",

Four good friends have a falling out, what's not to like?  Every actress is excellent.  \n\nThe mystery of the &gt;!two men in the room!&lt; has me intrigued and I can't wait to see how that turns out.  &gt;!When the detective showed Do Jae Yi the photo of the victim's back with stab wounds and she knew she'd cut her rapist's neck, I was as gobsmacked as she was.!&lt;  I love the countdown clock on KSA's phone as well.  All are adding to the tension for me.  \n\nThe fashion is off the charts, and all the women look gorgeous.  I always say a KDrama is guaranteed to give you beautiful locations and fashion, plus a good story.",

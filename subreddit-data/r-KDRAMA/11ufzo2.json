It's the scene at the bar where Na Hee-do tells the gang that she and Yi-Jin broke up. \n\nUnfortunately, Shazam has proven useless in picking up the song, so I don't know what it's called in order to find it. So hopefully someone here might know what song it was? \n\nAnd it just shows how obsessed I am with 2521 that I immediately recognised it and knew it exactly what scene it was from when I heard it in Crash Course. I've rewatched 2521 so damn much! \ud83d\ude02",

Earlier it was just Quiznos that featured prominently, but now in one episode I saw those ginseng packets, NorthFace and a couple more I dont recall!! That stick vacuum thingy too I think!",

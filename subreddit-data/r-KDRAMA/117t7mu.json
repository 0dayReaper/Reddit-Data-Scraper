As if making, birthing, and raising a whole human to be a productive member of society isn't a contribution to society, along with running a clean household &amp; ensuring everyone in it is fed and cared for. As if one's home life doesn't affect how one reacts to the world outside of it. \n\nIt's that de-valuation of domestic work women do just because it's unpaid labor. Seems to be a worldwide issue that needs to change.",

            "comment": "I will be honest, I jumped into this drama with minimal expectations, mainly to enjoy Cho seung woo's fantastic acting. But with each episode, I became more and more impressed with the storytelling style and the entire cast. This is a solid drama, easily topped my all time favorites HP and PP from SoL category. \n\nThe screenwriter did an amazing job of integrating slice of life aspects to the original law-focused webtoon and recreating the original neat and cynical ssh as a warm cuddly ball and creating quirky, loving characters like khg, jjs, Jun namja, the secretary lady, rameyon ladies and classy MIL and her good for nothing family. These characters are the best part of this drama. Thank you screenwriter-nim!\n\nThe cast did an excellent job giving life to their characters. Esp Cho seung woo. His character analysis and attention to details is scary. He choose his hairstyle because he used to wash his hair with lime water in Germany, his watch is a German brand, he ditched regular attorney attire and wore casual clothes to portray the free-spirited musician inside him. It was also his idea to include musical aspects while working on the cases to fully utilize his character's original background. I actually liked this inclusion the most, it gave a poetic touch to the cases. Even his weird dancing while singing trot were actually the dances of the original singers. And he actually played the piano by himself! He even made the piano teacher proud. His ability to portray such detailed emotions while playing such difficult pieces so smoothly is honestly breathtaking. I am thoroughly impressed by this talented, hardworking 'sexy Nam'. \n\nThe child actors have a bright future ahead if they choose to stay in acting. And whale-loving-atty-woo's dad should stick to dirty roles like this one haha it strangely suited him. Wish Jung moon sung had a detailed characterization, he was underutilized as an ML. The stepmom was so smooth at making everyone want to smack her that I am curious to check out her other works now. \n\nI liked that the cases were substantial and analysis-worthy unlike most other law drama. Interestingly, the webtoon writers actually consulted real lawyers while writing the cases. \n\nI will miss the characters. Esp the bromance. It is truly a shinsunghan (sacred) drama &lt;3",

Why is she this horrible? I'd love them to show us that instead of telling us.\n\nI also want to see more character development and an arc for Atty. Choi as well as the Hyung Geon and So Yeon's relationship. More Jeong Shik too!\n\nI'd love to see some play dates and camping with Gi Yeong and Hyeon-U (maybe Sung Han and Seo Jin too?).\n\nThis show can definitely have a season 2. I rarely ask for a second season but please give us season 2!",

The 3 guys are like what a true friendship looks like - supportive, empathetic, through thick and thin, never afraid to show weakness, fears, pain and tears, , always there for each other but knowing when to let go and leave each other alone, or to stay with them. They are mature adults, childish childhood friends, and they support each other equally, and knew when to let go. \n\nThat's what I feel was missing in 39 - it centered around one girl, our FL and it was always unbalanced in some way or other. They hid things from one another. Watching this show, it reminded me of 29 and why it felt like something was off. The difference in quality of the scriptwriter and director. \n\nAlthough CSW was the main star, his two friends never felt like minor supporting characters to prop up his character. &gt;!In 39, our FL got more time and storyline than the poor friend who died.!&lt;\n\nI'm glad I stuck with this show - one of the rare kdramas that ended better than it started. &gt;!And ended with a positive note too, for many of our !&lt;likeable lawyer's friends and office staff.",

The cook/housekeeper's reaction to the footage of him in the convenience store was very telling. \n\n\nShin Sung-han barely keeping himself together whilst questioning the father was very powerful. \n\n\nThe exchange in the court between grandmother and her son was also moving. I'm glad he came to his senses and &gt;!a) made the right choice for his son and b) put his wife in her place.!&lt; It took him forever to step up, but he finally got there in the end. What a horrible situation for him to be forced into seeing who he is truly married to.

She has the usual motive of all bullies.  Insecurity.  She feels inferior and lashes at everyone because of that.  Her inlaws never liked her, never approved of her, and preferred her husband's first wife to her.  For this reason, she not only worked to gain custody of her stepson (and his shares), she aimed to stamp out even the memory of his mother from him.

Dude why stay in that marriage knowing how disgusting conniving your wife is.!&lt;\n\nThe guilt Jeong-Sik is living with - &gt;!I am happy that Yu-Seok didn't take the money as I have a feeling that would have made the case even worse.!&lt;\n\nI'm happy that So-Yeon and Hyeong-Geun &gt;!are in a legit relationship and going to Europe together but I also wouldn't have minded if it was more along the lines of \"I'll be here when you get back\" and/or \"I'll come visit you on one of your legs\".!&lt; TBH it's a little too sweet of an ending for me, as I mostly watch murder/revenge/heavy detective series. LOL.\n\nI was hoping for one more camping scene with Shin, Hyeong-Geun and Jeong-Sik - &gt;!but drinking wine out of paper cups at a convenience store is pretty great.!&lt;\n\nGotta love&gt;! the temper tantrum Yu-Seok threw at the end.!&lt; LMAO. \n\nThis was such a nice, light series. Serious at time, there were tears but also a lot of laughs. I felt it was really well written and the cast was fantastic (again I might be biased because I totally crush on Cho Seung-Woo). I'm going to miss this, plus it went by so fast - how has six weeks already gone by.\n\nAlso - someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but it felt like there was little to no product placement. Given how blatantly obvious some product placement can be - either it was really subtle or non existent (maybe the cans they left on Jeong-Sik's office steps?).",

Dude why stay in that marriage knowing how disgusting conniving your wife is.\n\nI think that the trial opened his eyes to what kind of viper he married.  I have a feeling that he had been leaving the child-rearing to her.  Sung Han's words to him about how oblivious he was, must have stung.  He never realized how deeply unhappy his son was.  But it became clear that his wife didn't care to find out.  All she wanted to do is cover up any problem to maintain the illusion of a perfect family. Everything that was revealed, most especially that last phone call, took the blinders off as to the kind of person she really was.  Just like when you discover someone has been cheating on you, you look back and realize you have been seeing the signs all along but were ignoring them.\n\nHe's not divorcing I think, because divorce would hurt his reputation. I think the entire show spent a lot of time explaining that to us.  His mother spent her life hiding his father's affairs to save his reputation and that of the firm.  That is going to be her fate too from now on.  She might not have gotten kicked to the curb, as we all wished she was, but in some ways, she lost her husband and inherited a zombie marriage.  A fate that she more than deserved.\n\nMy one question though is how did Ms. Ma find out what the conversation was.  It happened right after they hung up, so it's not like Ju Haw told her.\n\nETA.  Rewatching the trial, I realized that everything she did, from ignoring the signs of depression from her step-son to the way she paid off Attorney Park was news to the oblivious father.  He took each new revelation as a blow.  Divorce or not, she is done.",

How Shin maintained the calmness not to lash out at her is beyond me. !&lt;Oh it would have been ON!\n\nIt was great to see that they did follow up &gt;!with Joon-Hui and her grandmother and taking on their case as pro bono to get the mother to start paying child support. I thought given the limited number of episodes left, we'd never see Joon-Hui again. !&lt;\n\nI do still wonder if Seo-Jin would keep her job at the law office once she goes back to the radio station, not sure she would have time for both. But on the other hand she could use what she's learned/learning at the law office to use in her new show (just a thought). \n\nLove the relationship between So-Yeon and Hyeong-Geun &gt;!\\- the whole \"let's go back to my place to watch tv and chill\" and then he falls asleep. NGL, the first scenes of the couple making out, I totally thought was them but nope... although I'm pretty sure that's what happened in the end. !&lt;\n\nAgain the friendship between Shin, Hyeong-Geun and Jeong-Sik is the best. I really want to see more and hope we magically get more. It's so well written and excellently done, very believable. &gt;!And Jeong-Sik following the new driver for Gi-Yeong - such a sweetie.!&lt;\n\nSome things have been brought to light - &gt;!we know what Yeong-Ju said to Ju-Hwa moments before her accident, we know why Ms. Ma is so determined to get as much money as possible and we know that Yeong-Ju was basically a conniving bish from the get go (moving to New York to move in with Jeong-Guk - and why is he so spineless when it comes to his son).!&lt;\n\nI can't believe tomorrow is the last episode - I've loved this series and wish there was more.",

But they aren't there yet, it's obvious, although I think considering the speed at which she got up after he made the suggestion to Netflix and chill, she is probably ready for it.

She did not even have strong backing (even her FIL was laughing at her about it) but she just bared her actual evil face to them. Was wondering why before but at least she said her family USED to be rich. GiYeong's dad seriously needs to grow a pair, how can he be so useless? Don't tell me she 'seduced/trapped' the dad while he was still married to JuHwa and she was sending pictures to her so she would file for a divorce and she could swooped in.

Everything that he had in him was poured out into episode 12 and for that he should at least earn a Baeksang nomination.  I know I wanted to make them all pay for hurting him.  Hwaiting!\n\nI find with most dramas, there are one or two \"scene stealers\", who fall under the radar with barely any notice but no less impact from me.  For Divorce Attorney Shin, I would like to nominate Secretary Sae-Bom from the Law Office.  She may not have had many scenes or dialogue, but her comedic timing was always on point and cracked me up each and every time.  I will be looking out for her other projects for sure.\n\nOne thing that became glaringly evident is that Jeong-Guk has as much cruelty in him as his father.  For him to do what he did to Ju-Hwa not only with their divorce but the custody of Gi-Yeong shows that the apple really does not fall far from the tree.  Episode 12 showed that he really was not under his wife's spell but was just as complicit in the wrongdoings as she was.   \nAnother reason for Atty Shin to remove his nephew from their clutches lest another generation of a-holes be spawned.  Let them be satisfied with their daughter Ha-Yul.  Only time will tell what she will become under their influence.  \n\nI am still a bit puzzled with the MIL and FIL's divorce.  What happens with her share that she negotiated and got from FIL? Will it be considered null now that she is going ahead with the divorce afterall? and does the new chauffeur have to give back the \"gift\" now that Atty Shin blew her testimony up. LOL  I for one was glad that Atty Park did not suddenly redeem himself and stuck to the character we were introduced to.  A conniving, souless excuse for a human being. Thank you Writer Yoo.\n\nSo step mother ends up with a shell of marriage not unlike her in-laws afterall.  Honestly, what did she expect.  You will lose him the way you got him. Ha!\n\nI will just miss this outstanding drama.",

She already got the shares, so he can't take them back.  \n\nNot sure what that thing was about the gift.  Was it mentioned? We saw it in a little flashback but I don't recall it being discussed in the trial.  Maybe it was implied.   THere were a lot of missing bits that we didn't see, what we saw of the trial was just the highlights.\n\nLooking back, the trial had an audience of one.  The father.  Every new revelation looked like he was hit.  They made him realize that he was totally unaware of what was going on under his nose.  His wife's machinations, the cluelessness of the staff and the unhappiness of his son.  It was eye-opening.  This was followed by the conversation with Shin where the accusation of being blind landed.\n\nThis is what led him to testify in court.  But I'm thinking it was more a sort of revenge, on his ex-wife's behalf, to expose the lawyer.  I think it was already decided prior to the \"bombshell\".  He said to his wife that he had asked the court to limit his parental rights instead of terminating them.  This implies that there was some negotiation behind the scenes.  \n\nThe only thing that I can complain about, is that I wished there had been more time to devote to these little subtleties, but they only had 12 episodes to work with.",

Try as I might, I couldn't get what he was saying to her except for the \"Let's live quietly\" part. Ouch.  Agree with you 100% that some of the storylines needed more fleshing out beginning way back when with the references to the Brahms's Three Romances Atty Shin made to the Cleaning Lady.

Hearing her final words to his ex-wife was the nail in the coffin.  He realized what a conniving heartless b@tch she is.  I think he definitely feels guilty.  For not realizing what she was, for the divorce and its aftermath, and for not recognizing how unhappy his son was.  The dead marriage is going to be his penance, I think.\n\nAlso, she failed the mission her father-in-law gave her.  She didn't accomplish a single thing.  I don't remember the exact terms of their bargain and what she would lose wasn't spelled out.  But she has lost whatever goodwill she had from him (if any), her mother-in-law continues to despise her (no wonder, after overhearing that conversation) and now she has lost her husband too.",

The lack of romance for the ML probably is one reason why it hasn't gotten as much buzz, but the friendship between the three friends is so well done, and the ultimate drive to reunite with his nephew it was just so, so good.

This is good for him, as he might not care much about being \"very very rich\" right now, but as an adult, things might be different.  So he gets the best of both worlds now.\n\n\n\nIt really sounds like a great decision.  A son should maintain contact with his father unless the relationship is toxic.  This way he will get all the love and support he needs from his uncle but has a chance to keep a connection with his father.  His MIL can be kept out of the picture altogether.",

Gi-Yeong's dad and step-mom have known each other from their earlier school days and moved in the same circles. Step-mom always had a thing for the dad but their marriage was not approved of by Gi-Yeong's grandparents.  Step-mom thought it was because her family lost their wealth but was told otherwise by MIL.  At some point Gi-Yeong's biological Mom and Dad met, married and were living in the US.  Step-mom found a way to also move there to be close to Gi-Yeong's dad.  One thing must have led to another since step-mom was determined to have him and the divorce happened.  Shame though because that one scene in the car where he called in and wanted to join Gi-Yeong's mom and grandmother on their outing you just felt that they were truly in love and in sync.",

Just one of the many hypotheses that we will have to make with no point of reference.  Her MIL cautioned her about being too kind where on the one hand she adored that about her since she directly benefitted from it, but she also saw it as a flaw and a handicap.",

    "postText": "First, let me talk about this cast. Lee Byung-hun (JSA, Iris), Song Seung-heon (You &amp; I, East of Eden), Kim Ha-neul (Piano) and Jun Ji-hyun (My Sassy Girl, My Love from the Star). All big stars, or were at one point. And the supporting cast for this has Cha Tae-hyun and Cho Jae-hyun. Korean dramas weren;t at their peak of the \u2018Korean Wave\u2019 but for well known actors starring in the small screen, this is a pretty top period. Most of these names are still fairly big, due to movies or later dramas. Some have simmered down from their earlier status but still retain a respectable career. Either way, it\u2019s a privilege to have a show in this era, in wide circulation. \n\nHappy Together is about 5 people who are related in some way, through marriage or blood, that find themselves at odds with each other. The leading man is Lee Byung-hun, as Seo Tae-poong, an ageing underachiever in Baseball, who longs to bring his siblings back together after he got separated from them following the death of his parents. 3 of the siblings still live together but lead different lives and barely co-exists, Tae-poong is considered an outcast, hardly a brother and there is a younger sister that they both think is lost to them forever. And while Tae-poong\u2019s attempts to bring the family back together aren\u2019t appreciated, the family goes through a tremendous growth, not only as individuals but as a family. It\u2019s a simple premise and a plot. There are added themes about prostitution and gang life through some of the main characters, such as Seo Moon-joo (Kang Sung-yeon) and  Jo Pil-doo (Cho Jae-hyun), but the family is the true crux of the story. Even the love triangle is an extension of the story between the two brothers of the family (Lee Byung-hun &amp; Song Seung-heon) The whole trope of an illness for one of the characters isn\u2019t terribly overused by this point and is used to bring the family closer, opposed to Beautiful Days (2001) or Stairway to Heaven (2003). It\u2019s a concise drama that doesn\u2019t go too bold with its storytelling while retaining heart and a good earnest message about family. \n\nDon\u2019t expect a big revenge or love story but expect to be pleasantly surprised by this drama. 16 episodes long and it went by like \\*clicks fingers\\*.",

It\u2019s not like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d with multiple seasons. With something like Kokdu, by episode four, it didn\u2019t need my undivided attention, so I\u2019d change out a load of laundry or check messages and not really worry I\u2019d miss anything. (Normally, I make sure to set aside time to sit and watch. If I have chores, I\u2019ll pause or wait for the episode to be over.) The only drama I\u2019ve dropped is \u201cQueen Seondeok\u201d, but I may try to tackle it again. \n\nI really wanted to like this drama. The premise had so much potential, but it ended up being a mess. I can now take it off my watchlist and forget about it. Though, if I see that Lim Soo-Hyung is starring in a drama, I might just give it a pass.",

Is hard to play in a mixture of Goblin, Black and Bulgasal and keep it original or serious.\nAnyway I welcomed this drama as a good pattern breaker in my kdrama addiction which became too much. I had my inhale exhale break, let the good drama come again now.",

And why can't I stop staring at Ji Yu's lips? \ud83d\ude1b\n\nThe way they look at each other is so \ud83d\ude0d  I didn't expect a tame actual-ramen-eating TBH. But it would have been out of character for both of them to do more at that point. I'm just glad Ji Yu took the initiative to let Ki Hoon know he is interested. Though Ki Hoon wasn't being discreet himself with that full day date out of nowhere \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis show will end next week and it will be too soon. KBLs have good stories to tell but no time to flesh them out. When they do get the time we get TMS2 and ASTCO.",

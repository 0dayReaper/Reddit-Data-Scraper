In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about the Korean language and honorifics system, check out our FAQ for even more information.\n\nIf you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.\n\n**What Is Hangeul/Hangul?**\n\nThe Korean phonemic writing system, in other words, the written Korean alphabet. [*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_hangeul_and_the_korean_language)\n\n**Why Do Koreans Use So Many English Words?**\n\nKorean language has many naturalized words borrowed from different languages, many of the naturalized words from 21st century come from English (eg. coffee, orange juice).\n\n**How To Romanize Korean Names**\n\nAccording to [Korea's official romanization system](https://www.korean.go.kr/front_eng/roman/roman_01.do):\n\n* (4) Personal names are written by family name first, followed by a space and the given name. As a rule, syllables in given names are not seperated by hyphen, but it is admitted to use a hyphen between syllables. (Transcription in (  ) is permitted.)\n\n&gt; Example\n\n&gt;&gt; \ubbfc\uc6a9\ud558\tMin Yongha (Min Yong-ha)\n\nAs for different ways of romanizing last names:\n\n* Transcriptions of family names will be established additionally.\n\nBasically, unifying romanization of last names will be a greater challenge since it involves a lot things (changing passports, verifying identities, cultural value of last names, etc.).\n\nLearn more about [romanization](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_romanization_of_korean) and [how to address others](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_addressing_others). \n\n**What Is Honorifics/Polite Speech?**\n\nHierarchy is very important in Korean culture and the Korean language reflects that through its complex honorifics system, the proper use of which is crucial for all social interactions. The Korean honorifics system is comprised of both specialized vocabulary and grammar rules, the most famous being its speech levels (addressee honorifics; distinctive sentence enders). The use of the honorifics system conveys important information about the context of the speech and the speaker\u2019s relationship with the subject (referent) and the listener (addressee) of the speech. The relationship indicated can be based on a variety of factors such as age, gender, social status, and degree of intimacy.\n\nThe most well-known aspect of the Korean honorifics system is its speech levels, also known as addressee honorifics (hearer honorifics), represented by distinctive sentence enders. The sentence enders are determined based on sentence type and the speaker\u2019s relationship to the listener (addressee) of the speech. The selection of which speech level to use is heavily context and purpose dependent, thus different speech levels are used to indicate varying degrees of social hierarchy, familiarity, and formality along with the purpose or intent of the speech. This means that sometimes a speaker will even use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation. Furthermore, depending on the exact context of use and communicative intent of the speaker, the meaning conveyed by the speech may be opposite or different than what that speech level traditionally represents (for example, if the speaker was being sarcastic). Thus no one style is polite or impolite in all situations, the context must be considered when figuring out the intended meaning. In general though, when the speaker wants to show respect toward the listener (addressee) of their speech, they will choose a honorific speech level. \n\nWhen discussing Korean speech levels, note that the Korean language itself is split along the lines of honorific [\uc874\ub313\ub9d0 (jondaemal)] and non-honorific [\ubc18\ub9d0 (banmal)] rather than informal and formal. And the key to determining whether honorific level should or should not be used depends on the relationship between the speaker and the listener and the situation. While it is true that in very formal situations, honorific forms will be used, it is not the case that non-honorific forms will always be used in non-formal situations. Honorific forms can still be used in informal situations.\n\nAn example to explain this is that you are trying to ask for directions from a stranger, for example the cashier at the convenience store. The situation is not a formal situation but you would still be using the honorific form (jondaemal) because you are addressing a stranger.\n\nIn any situation, formal or non-formal, if the listener is of superior status (due to age, generation, work relationship, etc.) and the speaker wants to acknowledge or demonstrate that difference, they would use honorifics when addressing the listener and at the same time \"lower\" themselves when talking about themselves. By \"lower\", it means that the speaker wants their language to reflect their respect for the listener. It's not used in the sense that the speaker consider themselves as inferior to the listener, just that they are trying to demonstrate their respect for the listener. If on the other hand, the speaker does not want to or need to lower themselves in comparison to the listener, their speech can reflect that too.   \n\n&gt;&gt; \uc874\ub313\ub9d0 (jondaemal) is honorific speech (also called polite speech), which includes both the deferential and the polite speech levels, and indicates that the speaker views the listener with respect and is honoring the listener. \uc874\ub300 (jondae) literally means respect.\n\n&gt;&gt; \ubc18\ub9d0 (banmal) is non-honorific speech (also called impolite speech), which includes both the plain and the intimate speech level. \ubc18\ub9d0 (banmal) can be literally translated as *half-speech*.\n\nBelow is a ***rough*** guide to honorific markers in Korean and their significance. For more details, see our [full section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_honorifics_and_speech_levels) on honorifics in our KDRAMA 101. \n\n**2 Important Things To Remember**\n\nA speaker may use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation.\n\nNo speech level is polite or impolite in all situations; the context and intent of the speaker is the ultimate determinator of intended meaning. (In other words: *sarcasm* exists.) \n\n**When You Hear ~\u1107\ub2c8\ub2e4  ~\u1107\ub2c8\uae4c?  ~\u1107\uc2dc\uc624  ~\u1107\uc2dc\ub2e4** { ~pnida  ~pnikka?  ~psio  ~psida }\n\n&gt; ***Speech Level***: Deferential\n\n&gt; ***Used When***: Public or formal discourse such as in broadcasting or conference presentations. | Addressing the public. | When a subordinate addresses a superior in a formal situation.\n\n\n**When You Hear ~\uc694 (~yo)**\n\n&gt; ***Speech Level***: Polite\n\n&gt; ***Used When***: Addressing someone of senior status in casual, non-formal, and everyday types of conversations. | Addressing someone who is an equal, based on factors such as age/status/power/etc. (coworkers, acquaintances, classmates, etc.) | Between strangers. | Addressing someone older. | In a new relationship (friendship/dating).\n\n\n**When You Hear ~\ub2e4  ~\ub2c8/\ub0d0?  ~\ub77c  ~\uc790** { ~da  ~ni?/nya?  ~ra  ~ja }\n\n&gt; ***Speech Level***: Plain\n\n&gt; ***Used When***: In written form for nonspecific listeners (books, magazines, etc.) | When a superior addresses a subordinate. | Addressing someone younger in casual situations but the relationship may not be a super close one. | Addressing close friends or otherwise agreed to by both parties (includes dating relationships).\n\n\n**When You Hear ~\uc5b4/\uc544 ( ~eo/a)**\n\n&gt; ***Speech Level***: Intimate\n\n&gt; ***Used When***: Between close friends of similar age. | Between family members. | When an elder addresses a child.\n\n\n**When You Hear ~\ub2d8 (~nim) and \uc528 (~ssi)**\n\n&gt; * ~nim and ~ssi are honorific title suffixes, used to show respect by the speaker for the person who\u2019s name/job title is modified with the suffix.\n\n&gt; * ~nim shows the most respect and can be added directly to names or job titles with or without the surname (used to distinguish when multiple people hold the same position).\n\n&gt; * ~ssi can only be added to names, not job titles. Can be attached to full name (more formal/less intimate), only the given name (less formal/more intimate), or just the surname (implies the addressee is of lower social position).\n\n**When You Hear \ub098 (na) and \uc6b0\ub9ac (uri) for I/Me and Us**\n\n&gt; * Used when speaker and listener are relatively equal to each other or are close to each other.\n\n&gt; * Generally not used in formal situations.\n\n**When You Hear \uc800 (jeo) and \uc800\ud76c (jeohui) for I/Me and Us**\n\n&gt; * Used when the listener is of superior status or when speaking with strangers.\n\n&gt; * Used often in formal situations.\n\n\n**Addressing Someone By Name**\n\nKoreans generally do not call people by their given names unless the speaker is a (close) friend, colleague, or superior of the listener. When names are used, they are often modified with honorific suffixes. Below are examples of use. \n\n&gt; **Full Name + ~\ub2d8/~\uc528** Used when addressing someone distant (no close personal relationship) or when a service employee is calling a customer. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (\uc874\ub313\ub9d0 (jondaemal)). (\uae40\uc9c4\ud638 \ub2d8 or \uae40\uc9c4\ud638 \uc528)\n\n&gt; **Given Name + ~\uc528** Used to address coworkers, acquaintances, friends or when a superior addresses a subordinate (such as in a work or college environment). Can imply that the interpersonal relationship is not a very close one. But can also just be a conscious decision by the relevant parties to remain respectful of each other. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (\uc874\ub313\ub9d0 (jondaemal)). (\uc9c4\ud638 \uc528)\n\n&gt; **Given Name** Used between (close) friends, classmates, or when someone older is addressing a younger person that they know or are familiar with. Parents would also call their children by just their given name. Used in conjunction with non-honorific speech levels (\ubc18\ub9d0 (banmal)). (\uc9c4\ud638) *Note:* sometimes the vocative marker -a/-ya is added at the end of the name. This generally indicates a very close relationship. \n\n&gt; **Full Name** When parents are addressing their child, it could either signify the child is in trouble (angry/exasperated tone) or the parent wants to talk to the child as an equal (friend) instead of asserting their parental authority (usually seen in dramas when the parent pulls the child over to sit and discuss something important). When used between friends or in a relationship, the person speaking is probably angry or the person being called is being absentminded/distracted and not paying attention. (\uae40\uc9c4\ud638 (!))\n\n**Addressing Someone By Title**\n\nKoreans generally address each other by their (work) title. The honorific suffix ~nim can be added to the end of the title to show respect. This is especially the case when subordinates would address their superiors, they would use their superior\u2019s title + ~nim suffix. It is possible to add the full name or just the surname before the title to clarify exactly who is being referred to if multiple people hold the same title. Coworkers may address each other as name + title without the ~nim suffix. When a superior addresses a subordinate, they generally do not add the ~nim suffix to the subordinate\u2019s title or name. Some commonly used examples of titles:\n\n|**Title**|**With Suffix**|**Meaning**|**Notes**|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|\n|\uc0ac\uc7a5|\uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8|President, CEO, Owner|In a large company, refers to president of the company. For a shop/restaurant, refers to the owner. Can be used without attaching name in front.|\n|\uacfc\uc7a5|\uacfc\uc7a5\ub2d8|Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\uac10\ub3c5|\uac10\ub3c5\ub2d8|Director, Superintendent|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\ud300\uc7a5|\ud300\uc7a5\ub2d8|Team Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\ubd80\uc7a5|\ubd80\uc7a5\ub2d8|Director, Department Head|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\ub300\ub9ac|\ub300\ub9ac\ub2d8|Deputy, Assistant Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\ud68c\uc7a5|\ud68c\uc7a5\ub2d8|Chairman|Can be used without attaching name in front. When used to address the person directly, generally only surname is added. When used to refer to the person, full name may be added.|\n|\uc774\uc0ac|\uc774\uc0ac\ub2d8|Director|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\uc120\uc0dd|\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8|Teacher, Doctor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n|\uad50\uc218|\uad50\uc218\ub2d8|Professor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|\n\n**Addressing Others By Their Social Position/Relationship**\n\nKoreans may also address each other based on their social position or relationship. Below are the most commonly used ones.\n\n* **Seonbae-Hubae (\uc120\ubc30/\ud6c4\ubc30)**\n\n&gt; \uc120\ubc30 (seonbae) is a Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a senior or elder in an organization, or an upperclassman when talking about school. But its use is not limited to a work or school setting, it can be applied more broadly as in \u201ca seonbae in life\u201d. Its Hanja is \u5148\u8f29 and can be literally translated as prior (\uc120/\u5148) generation (\ubc30/\u8f29). The priority does not depend on the age of the people in question but rather the achievement. So one can be a \uc120\ubc30 in school, work, or life achievements (such as marriage or having children).\n\n&gt; \ud6c4\ubc30 (hubae) is the corresponding Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a junior in an organization or an underclassman when talking about school. Its Hanja is \u5f8c\u8f29 and can be literally translated as later (\ud6c4/\u5f8c) generation (\ubc30/\u8f29). Again, the deciding factor is not the age of the people in question but the timing of the achievement.\n\n&gt; When the honorific suffix ~nim is added to \uc120\ubc30, it usually means that the two people are not very close personally or the situation is more formal (business meeting as opposed to coffee). When the hubae has a close relationship with the seonbae, they may use seonbae without the ~nim suffix.\n\n* **Haksaeng (\ud559\uc0dd)**\n\n&gt; When an adult is talking to a student-aged young person that they do not know, they may address them with \ud559\uc0dd (haksaeng), which literally means student. This does not need to take place near a school, it could be anywhere. For example, it could be an adult asking a student on the street for directions.\n\n* **{Child's Name} + Father/Mother**\n\n&gt; When adults are addressing other adults who are parents, it is possible to call the adult as their child\u2019s name + father/mother instead of the adult's given name. So the father of the child will be called {child\u2019s name} \uc544\ubc84\ub2d8 (a-beo-nim, father), while the mother will be called {child\u2019s name} \uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8 (eo-meo-nim, mother). If the conversation is one-one, such as when a teacher is talking only to one student\u2019s parents without other people in the conversation, they may not add the child\u2019s name in front and directly use \uc544\ubc84\ub2d8 and \uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8.\n\n**Kinship Terms**\n\nTraditionally, Korean families were large and several generations would live together in a single household. As a result, kinship terms in Korean are well-developed and very specific according to the relationship in play. However, changes in social structure has affected the use of these terms and some are no longer used as often or how they are used has changed. Additionally, some kinship terms have been adapted for general use in daily life to refer to people other than relatives.\n\nIn addition to the abundance of kinship terms available, their proper use is complicated by the fact that choosing the appropriate term depends on who the listener is. \n\nExamples:\n\n&gt; * A grandson talking directly to his maternal grandmother can just address her as \u201cgrandmother\u201d but if he was talking to his classmate, he would use \u201cmaternal grandmother\u201d to describe her.\n\n&gt; * An uncle talking to his nephew about the nephew\u2019s father would use \u201cyour father\u201d instead of \u201cmy younger brother.\u201d \n \nIn order to differentiate the uses, this section on kinship terms will be split into two parts, the first part will address kinship terms when used to address relatives and the second part will highlight kinship terms in their other common uses. See more info and a list of kinships in our [KDRAMAS 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources)",

It's kind of terrible because there is little explanation of any grammatical structure or formalness, but also I am still learning things from it through the repetition of phrases and sentence structure.\n\nIf you are patient and like gamified learning that reminds you and gives you a daily goal, give it a try. However, there is very little focus on phrasebook/useful for travel kind of sentences. At nearly halfway through the entire course, they've introduced some phrases that you could use with other people instead of weird sentences that use the vocabulary.\n\nI added Busuu to my studying that seems to be the complete opposite of Duolingo. short lessons with the context as the most important part (at least in the beginning). It gives a couple versions of a phrase or the phrase and appropriate responses.\n\nI am going to start Pimsleur for speaking when I feel a bit more confident I understand the grammatical structure and have build some more vocabulary.",

There is also a mini course based around a made-up drama that talks about social conventions in the workplace and general phrases for common situations. \n\nI didn't start Duolingo before the recent upgrade the wiped out language notes, but I googled and found a wiki of what notes there were. I kind of get what Duo is trying to do now (other than kept you coming back for the gamification), but for languages with formal and informal there is a serious omission of instruction. \n\nAlso, the numbering systems almost made me lose my mind the way Duo presented it. There are 2 systems (one for things/people/animals and one for time and money), and when you count stuff you add a counter word to show what you are counting. It would just start fast-talking strings of numbers to match up. I almost quit. And then did it again for the other system.",

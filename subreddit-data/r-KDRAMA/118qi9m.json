            "comment": "**Love To Hate You (10/10)** I binged this one on the weekend and it was so refreshing! The FL is badass and doesn\u2019t take shit from\nanyone - but once she falls in love with the ML she shows that she also has a cute and vulnerable side. The second ML was sooo fine. \n\n**Doom At Your Service (6/16)** Omo. I love the visuals of this drama so much and it reminds me a bit of Goblin from the look and feel of it. The chemistry of the main couple is off the charts! Park Bo-Young is so beautiful and Seo In-Guk makes my heart flutter. The handholding as a plot device is so damn cute. I\u2019m sure that this one will shatter my heart into thousand pieces and I\u2019m not ready!! \ud83d\ude2d My favorite quote: \u201cLove me to the point that you want to destroy the world for me\u201d\n\n**Crash Course On Romance (12/16)** Guys I\u2019m not ready for this one to end! This drama makes my weekends better since AOS ended. Hope they nail the last four episodes and resolve the murder plot neatly. \n\n**Our Blooming Youth (4/20)** I\u2019m too busy with work and social life this week that I didn\u2019t got around to watch the latest episodes. Hoping that the plot moves a bit quicker than last week, it was a bit slow compared to first two tbh. Curious how this show will progress having 20 episodes. \n\n**Call It Love** / **The Heavenly Idol** So many dramas so little time! I need a month off of work to catch up on my watchlist lol. Note sure if I will get around to start these two this week but I look forward to them both! \n\n**Side note:** Is anybody else so obsessed with kdramas that they don\u2019t have time to catch up on western shows? I wanted to start The Last of Us for ages now but can\u2019t seem to take a break of kdramas lol",

I know there are a lot of classics pre 2014 but it\u2019s the dated look that gets in my way from watching. \n\nRewatching is totally understandable, especially if it\u2019s a series that hits home for you. Ive rewatched a few but for the most part have tried my best to hold off on rewatching until a few years down in the future. That way it feels like I\u2019m watching them for tue first time again.",

I'm really liking the romance trope, but I'm unsure of the secondary plot and the way everything keeps unfolding. I hope I don't end up with major second lead syndrome in Nam Haee's case.\n\n**Summer Strike (10/12):** I'm a simp when it comes to good communication. I really like how the leads have very good communication. Resolving potential conflicts with a quick 'Why am I acting like a drama queen' realization is great technique everyone must learn.\n\n**Diary of a Prosecutor (1/16):** I'm just starting out with this, not really sure how I'll like this. Since it is a legal/courtroom drama I'm already sold. But, this has Lee Sun-kyun as cookie points. I like the humor in writing so far. Fingers crossed on how this'll turnout.",

I loved that instead of an unnecessary murder plot (hello, CCIR) we got some action scenes with the movie scenes, which I thought were a lot of fun. This was one of the better romances I've seen in a while because there was such a strong focus on the actual romance between the two leads.

The FL was just so unapologetically herself and I loved how she was always willing to call out the double standards that women face in society. The relationship between FL and ML was wonderful, I truly loved how you got to see the FL\u2019s feeling slowly change towards the ML and change towards love in general. The ML was so so sweet throughout and I adored watching him fall for the FL. Also, the friendship between ML and SML was such a good representation of friendship between men. They were always there for each other, could be emotional and vulnerable around the other, and were not shy with physical affection either. I also really liked how when the &gt;!gay rumors!&lt; happened, neither of them were disgusted with the idea of &gt;!being gay!&lt;, just disgusted with the situation in general. That was refreshing to me as often when rumors such as those happen I feel like males will act offended at the mere thought of &gt;!being gay!&lt;;whereas, neither one of these guys did that. Overall, this was just so enjoyable to watch!\n\n**Soundtrack #1** - another one I loved a lot! I loved the relationship between the ML and the FL a lot. I liked how it showed how much the ML cared for the FL, and it showed the FL\u2019s slow realization that she loved the ML as well. I\u2019m honestly so surprised how much slow burn pining and then feelings realization that they were able to fit into just four episodes! It really felt like the perfect amount of time!\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** (6/16) - I\u2019ve fallen behind in this one and haven\u2019t made any progress in awhile sadly. Still really love this one though! Just going through a bit of a slump that\u2019s making it hard to watching airing and longer dramas!\n\n**Flower of Evil** (12/16) - another one my slump is affecting so no recent progress either!\n\nAs I mentioned I\u2019ve been in such a bad slump recently (not just with kdramas but with everything it feels like) so I\u2019m struggling a bit to watch anything. However, I\u2019ve found that shorter dramas have been helping a lot as I\u2019ve been able to finish two within the last week which as been nice! I asked for short drama recommendation on r/kdramarecommends and I think I\u2019ll pick a couple more to try out to hopefully help me out of my slump some more before trying to return to longer dramas. I just can\u2019t decide which one to try out first! I feel like right now it\u2019s between **Birthcare Center**, **My Name**, and **D.P.**",

            "comment": "**Crash Course in Romance(4/16)** I-LO-VE-IT. For me is the perfect K-drama to watch, specially after a long day. I like every single character and the main plot is interesting and it has a good balance between romance-humor-drama.\n\n**Alchemy of Souls(12/20) 1st Season:** This one was recommended by my uncle(we are both addicted! and love K-Dramas) To me this is the perfect one. It has good visuals, FX, charismatic, a good plot and subplots, perfect combo of humour-drama-romance, good actors. So if you are considering to watch this one, go for it. It could be a bit slow at the beginning, but it's totally worth it. Binging this one so badly. \n\n*Giving a second chance*\n\n**Mad for Each Other (8/13)** As a mental health profesional this got my attention, It give you the perspective about mental health and how others sees you when you are suffering, the daily living of people who struggle with some conditions and how they cope. I stopped this one cause subtitles are terrible and I think, specially in this one, should be clear and well done. I like this one but the subtitles are making me to reconsider if I should continue this one.\n\n**Move to Heaven (5/10)** This one is beautiful, but I had to stop because I was watching in during a time were I wasn't in a good spot so I always ended crying and feeling sad. This one is worth it but get ready to cry, A LOT.\n\n**Age of Youth 2nd Season (1/14)** The first season has a special spot in my hearth, it's definetely one of my top ten favourites. But due the changes I felt a bit mad and salty to this one...it's the only K-drama that I gave a third oppotunity(My policy is two strikes) Probably I'm gonna finish it because the new character is so intriguing and not gonna lie I have a crush on Jo Eun(Choi Ara) that Tomboyish look caught me out of guard OMG &lt;3\n\nDo you have a policy like me to rewatch or stop watching? Btw I'm watching all of them in Netflix, Subs are pretty bad in spanish(my mother tongue) and I don't like them dubbed. Sometimes I wish to know korean because I feel I'm missing some gags, subtle messages or even key info for the plot.",

All of the characters are really well-developed, the script is great, the teens are great. What more to say? \n\n**Our Blooming Youth, Heavenly Idol, Kokdu:** I've started all of these and I guess I'm most invested in Our Blooming Youth. I'll continue Heavenly Idol for a few more episodes. \n\n**Meow the Secret Boy/Welcome:**  Every year I seem to rewatch this one, watching one or two episodes at night. I know the premise is weird and I just can't explain it to other people, but I really love this drama. The actors are perfectly (uh, purrfectly??) cast and Kim Myung Soo is so cat-like in his portrayal. Seo Ji Hoon is one of my favorite actors who lights up the screen when he smiles (Mama Fairy) but he embodies the angst of this character so well. I just love this drama. It's not a 10/10 but it gives me great enjoyment. \n\n**Gu Family Book/Kangchi, the Beginning:** This one is a classic that I am rewatching with my  long-distance kdrama-watching friend. We are loving it. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it on Viki. It's an epic fantasy tale of a Gumiho with Lee Seung Gi and Suzy. It's 10 years old and the drama has aged well. \n\nLooking forward to all of **Island** and **The Glory**. And the news on Soompi that Gong Yoo might be in a drama with Seo Hyun Jin. Oh my!",

Not men's politics\n\nIt also shows different professional fields due to FL's occupations",

I usually stick to watching 1 drama at a time now. Maybe the multiple dramas at a time thing is mainly possible for those who don't have to deal with other things in life like work, school, other matters that take up more time in life.

No progress since last week because I just could not sit still long enough to get into it, which worries me about finishing it. \r  \n\r  \n**Our Blooming Youth** (2/20) \u2014 Also no progress since last week. It is excellent so far just very slow and very historical. Gotta have the right mindset to watch, which I haven't.\r  \n\r  \n**Crash Course in Romance** (12/16) \u2014 I am going to be heartbroken with this drama if it goes off the rails! I look forward to it each weekend! The leads are so so good together. \n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (1/16) \u2014 I like this one so far. It's got an interesting premise - what a bizarre mash up of plot points. It's light and funny, which is not at all like some of the darker and more serious ones I'm watching so its nice. \n\n**Call it Love** (1/16) \u2014 I like it so far. But I'm in the mood for a messy melodrama after The Interest of Love fell so flat. Hope this one can deliver. But what is with the rose gold/pink hue? Mixed opinions on that. \n\n**Island** (2/12) \u2014 wanted to wait until part 2 was coming out before starting this one because I don't do cliffhangers well. So far I am really enjoying this one, especially Cha Eun Woo. His acting has definitely improved. \r  \n\r  \nStarted:\r  \n\r  \n**Hotel Del Luna** (3/16) \u2014 I like this one so far. I like a lot of other dramas/shows that this could be grouped with (Tomorrow and Mystic Pop Up Bar for example) so we shall see. \n\nNon-Korean:\r  \n\r  \n**My Beautiful Man season 2 or Utsukushii Kare** (3/4) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 Still loving this one. And this last episode was not a surprise - the plot needed to happen to further the story along. Straight out of the book. Can't wait for the two leads to understand why they are reacting the way they are within the plot - its pretty obvious to viewers. Very cute together. \r  \n\r  \n**The End of the World With You or Bokura no Micro na Shuumatsu** (4/8) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 One of the leads is still a bastard, but I freaking love this show. The characters are different and fun to watch together. \n\n**Bed Friend** (1/8) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames \u2014 read the book and, wow, its a steamy, messy, one about friends with benefits that fall in love. Hope it picks up, it does in the book but I can already see some of the changes so we shall see.",

Thank God we only made it through one episode because I should've taken the TV-MA rating more seriously! This is a dark drama I can only describe as serial killer p0rn. The last drama I watched was **Cinderella and the Four Knights** so this was quite the tonal shift. \n\nVery well executed and directed, much more of a mood piece than a straightforward thriller, and the plot makes some characters behave like idiots. Be prepared for explicit sex scenes and nudity, as well as graphic violence. Scenes of razors and slicing make me nauseous and I was pretty roiled by the end so content warning! \n\nThe acting was stellar, though, especially the leads, Kang Hye-rim and Kim Young-Kwang. They had a kind of psychotic chemistry that really worked. \n\nOnly watch if this kind of dark, psycho- sexual thriller is your bag. \n\nI'm starting **Love to Hate You** because man my brain needs a break.",

Go Ara was good in this role, and the two male leads were, too. Some good emotional moments as well. What I didn't like was the way they revealed the husband. In 1997, I remember it being much smoother unless I just don't remember it properly. Here, they just show all the instances where they interact with the husband but don't show his face ... just now with his face shown, which was annoying to me. Other than that, yes, there are flaws, but they don't make me hate the drama. 7.5/10.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (8/16)** \u2014 I don't care about it anymore. I like Kim Jung Hyun, but it's not enough for me to like this drama. I'm hate watching at this point just to complete it. Since last year, I started hating watching on-air dramas and stopping them midway because I end up continuing them anyway to get them out of my skin. At 2x speed, of course. I'll endure with this one.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (2/16)** \u2014 Taxi Driver is back, and it's as crazy as ever. Actually, this was more nonsensical, but Taxi Driver had never been a drama of realism, so I don't care. Maybe the cases are based off real things that happen, but the way they handle the cases is always crazy. Another great thing is ... the OST is good, and I forgot how well it got me in the mood of the drama. Can't wait for more. More Shin Jae Ha, too, please. He had like 2 seconds of screentime this week.\n* **Law School (14/16)** \u2014 Going quickly through this because I'm not into this drama too much. I like certain aspects of it, but it's not for me. \n* **Crash Course in Romance (12/16)** \u2014 These two episodes sprung a lot of discussion in a lot of places. So much is happening, and I've now just realizing we have two weeks left of the drama. How? It feels like we just started.\n* **Our Blooming Youth (5/16)** \u2014 The leads are great on screen, and their relationship is quite fun at times, then cute at times. Park Hyung Sik really has a wonderful presence. He suits this kind of role. Also still loving the secondary characters. Although, episode 5 was &gt;!heartbreaking because the friendship of the crown prince is falling apart and the situation is getting interesting!&lt;.",

Really enjoying this rewatch...which is my first (full) rewatch after watching the drama as it initially aired in 2011 so it's been more than a decade between the two watches. Drama has held up well and while the acting from the kids is green all around, their energy is infectious.\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (8/16) Absolute love for how well the writers are playing around with the dialogue and subversion of tropes and expectations. My favorite thing about this drama is that so much of it can be simply straightforward 'typical' romcom scenes and dialogue but once you add the fantasy *and* historical past framing to the scene, there's so much to compare and contrast that just gives the present scenes and dialogue more depth and meaning.\n\n**Cruel Temptation** (88/129) FL's birth family really is her worst enemy.\n\n**Game of Witches** (85/120) This one started off well but has stalled for the last 20 episodes. Still watching because I like the romance and the fun confrontation scenes. \n\n**Three Body** (cdrama, 12/30) Have not read the novel so the story is completely new to me and I have no clue where it's going. This one definitely requires concentration to watch. I'm pretty close to giving up on figuring things out and just being a happy turkey along for the ride.",

            "comment": "Slow and steady, now less backlogs and more room for new on-air dramas.\n\nFinished\n\n\\- **If You Wish Upon Me:** a tale of two halves, the first one great, with stand-alone eps and a main storyline on the background, the second one average, pacing so slow and less focus on leads for hit or miss plotlines. Acting is A+, cast is an All Star team with JCW in a proper ML role and Sooyoung on a FL that deserved more depth; secondaries really interesting with Sung Dong Il on his usual masterclass and even the bad guys kind of enjoyable, aside from the \"big\" one. Ups and downs but actors carry, a 7.5 that could have been more.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **Crash Course in Romance (12/16):** now that the romance is in full go mode I'm liking it a bit more, but there's still a lot out there to explain in 4 eps and I'm not sure I want that instead of more rom-com shenanigans. Plus acting and chemistry between the leads is finally on point, decent secondaries, forgettable thriller subplot;\n\n\\- **Kokdu, Season of Deity (8/16):** chaos, flaws aplenty, a ton of fun. KJH is literally shouldering this one all by himself, a masterful performance full of expressions and flair, although ISH is doing a good job even if her FL is too much of a klutz. For all the mistakes, plots, characters left hanging, this is a wildly entertaining ride.\n\nI'm ready for more weirdness in **Divorce Attorney Shin** with the ML iconic in Stranger and I will binge **Taxi Driver 2** in due time.",

Will give it a chance. \n\nCrash Course in Romance - Just finished ep one. Not feeling as bingeable yet, but watchable. Will see where it goes. \n\nThe Fabulous - I have one episode left, I don't know why I haven't knocked it out yet but I will for the completionist in me lol.\n\nPhysical 100 - finished that and enjoyed it. \n\nThe Glory - in a holding pattern waiting for part 2. Counting down the days!! \n\nThe Island - planning to start next week, I think part 2  resumes then as well this weekend. \n\nMiss the Dragon - On the cdrama side, I'm on Dylan Wang kick and started this one.",

I also liked how the supporting characters at times seemed more central and had their own story arcs.  I would recommend this to anyone who has ever felt afraid to come out of their shell as it feels very heartwarming.  After finishing this show I'm not sure what to watch now.",

I wanted to watch more of Park Hyungsik so instead of listening to ZE:A\u2019s songs on a loop and rewatching his old dramas, I\u2019m watching this movie.",

It's a fun time for sure.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol (2/12)** Really enjoyed the first episodes, eager to see more\n\n**Life (5/16)** I'm ambivalent about this show. A poster on here told me I'd like Cho Seung Woo, an actor I had never seen before, in this and they were right.  He is the highlight of the show by far.  I enjoy the debates about medical ethics and the business side of health care, but I also find stretches of this show dull.\n\n**History of the Salaryman (5/22)** This has been a wild ride so far.  It's got a lot of big personalities, black comedy, corporate intrigue, a bit of murder, some burgeoning romances (I think?).  I'm hooked.",

I might start watching it soon.",

            "comment": "Currently going in-between a few here:\n\n**The Uncanny Counter** **(8/16)** Man does this show continue to catch my interest. The continued mystery alongside the fantasy elements keep me engaged and questioning. Really excited to see how this one ends. Also I LOVE Kim Se-Jeong so much and she does well in everything she does. \n\n**Oh My Baby (7/16)** I took a short break from this one just because one of the ML was getting insufferable. I know, I know, it's hard for a man to be true to his feelings, but it just got to a point where I was yelling at my screen wanting him to be more emotionally available. Will definitely pick it back up after Uncanny Counter though. I have to see how the harem-style love story plays out of course. \n\n**Clean With Passion For Now (12/16)** I really just had to drop this one. I got all the way to 12 episodes and there was little to no character development from either of the leads. The comedy elements were a little cringe to me, and just continued to repeat the same gag over and over. \n\n**Crash Course in Romance (14/16)** PEOPLE. Watch this if you haven't already. At first, I was skeptical about how a romantic comedy could turn into a thriller, but man does it work well. I've been keeping up with it weekly and get so excited when new episodes come out. Not ready for this one to end!",

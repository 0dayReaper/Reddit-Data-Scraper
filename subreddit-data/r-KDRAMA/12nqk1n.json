It\u2019s satisfying to see she swiped that credit card left and right. I guess the cheating will be the last straw for divorce. \n\nI love what they did with the flashback, the grain and smaller frame. The young actors are such an eye candy to look at. They both were really in the wrong at that time but i hope it\u2019s not a cop out for her to forgive him for how he\u2019s treating her now.\n\nSo sad when she didn\u2019t know what her happiness was. I think many moms can resonate with it. Being busy with taking care of the family everyday that their own happiness is the last priority.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the chaos that she now joined a residency.",

I've watched men chase a woman for a year and a half with NOTHING but the most intense chivalry and kindness imaginable. The second he knocks her up, she's dead to him. Only the children matter. And then he'll go around doting on his daughter, not realizing that by treating her mother like trash, he's setting his daughter up to find a man that will only like her superficial physical features and continue the cycle. T\\_T Really really sad. \n\nI grew up watching my dad wash my mom's clothes after she recovered from having my sibling, installing an ac unit in her room, buying her presents every other day. I didn't realize how incredibly special that was until I started hearing and seeing stories of how my friends fathers treated them and their mothers. I feel bad saying it but...with fathers like the one in Dr. Cha, it must be so hard to love them when you see their true colors.",

And she got pregnant.\n\nIn contrast, CS left the country after that incident, for 15 years, and then purposefully returned as a 40 something year old woman to seek out a man that had now been married nearly two decades. Knowing the man already IS a cheater, knowing that unprotected sex puts families at risk, oh and worse, when the man is considering giving his liver to his dying, literally DYING wife, this woman that was in his life for all of...maybe 1-2 years in the past? Has the audacity to ask for 'his heart, his liver, all of it.' That part almost made me throw my laptop, the absolute GAL on that chick. Imagine being the side chick telling a man not to save the woman he made lifelong vows to stand with, even texting him right up the surgery.\n\nComparing the actions of fresh college kids to a 40 something, it makes it incredibly hard for me to feel bad for her. Ages aside, the depth of the relationships (2 years vs 15), makes it harder. That's like me finding my ex from 12th grade that cheated with some chick, hunting him down as I have gray hair coming in at 45, and trying to seduce him out of some middle age fright. It's...yeah, to me there's nothing to feel bad about in her case, I'm still waiting for them to redeem her. At the end of the day, cheating shows your personal values, and hers seem to be 'if I was there first, it's mine forever.'",

Cheating is unforgivable in EVERY SINGLE WAY, but a woman cheating will always irritate me even more. She is cheating not for lust, not out for 'blind passion', she is CALCULATEDLY, emotionally invested in a man that's been married for 2 damn decades!!! And consistently still trying to rip his family apart, giving absolutely not a flying frick about his daughter, his son, his nasty MIL. \n\nAnd why??? For a 53 year old father of 2?? Woman, you're single, youre gorgeous, go, BE A WOMAN. I'll never understand attractive middle aged women flocking around the same 2-3 married men instead of...seeking their own partner. The scene where she goes up to wedding dress in the department store window and scoffs, like 'it shouldve been me.' Aight girl, maybe, maybe when you were 23. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut willingly leaving the country for 15 years and then coming back only to ACTIVELY seek out a college ex to cheat??? That's actually insane in every way. I think they thought the 'I was first' thing could actually hold up?? As if young adults don't switch partners every other week. Cheating when your prefrontal cortex isn't even developed is one thing, being a 3 times grown certified adult, &gt;!and dragging your kid into that bs too?? !&lt;She's been irredeemable to me so far.",

Like someone said, it isn't ENA that introduced viewers to EAW, it's the show that brought viewers to ENA. \n\n I only hope that the ratings continue to rise going forward, although **EAW** is going to have tough competition from upcoming Wed/Thurs dramas (**Adamas; If You Wish Upon Me**).",

I\u2019m watching with my son who has autism and he frequently points out \u201cI do that\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t but this other kid does\u201d (we end up pausing a lot discuss things and to answer questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s a plaintiff\u201d).  \n\nI know a lot of people confuse \u201chigh functioning\u201d with little-to-no-symptoms or with \u201csuper smart\u201d. High functioning just means the person can be independent and handle most daily living tasks.  I was very thankful they didn\u2019t go the \u201cautism = unfeeling asshole\u201d route that I\u2019ve seen in other shows.  So while she is definitely high functioning, her symptoms aren\u2019t hidden. \n\nWoo benefits from being super smart, having the right kind of support, and honestly, being attractive. People are much more accepting of disabilities in attractive people. \n\nI would love if we got some flashbacks about the types of supports she got as a kid. We\u2019ve seen the bullying but she didn\u2019t get any SPED services or have a therapist?  If she has problems opening bottles of water, she probably would have been working with an OT.  My son has put in tons of hours with all sorts of people to get where he is today.\n\nEdited to add, anyone else shout out \u201cIdea Whale!\u201d or just us?",

However, EAW is definitely one of the better shows in terms of handling ASD representation, and Woo Young Woo is just so dang charming and lovable. \n\nMost ASD protags in media are male, so WYW is definitely a breath of fresh air. Her ASD is never portrayed as something funny, but rather just part of her character, and when WYW is uncomfortable, it's not played for laughs as the audience feels it with her. Not only that, but the characters have a lot of mature talks about ASD and it's affects on not only WYW but her father as well, which I really appreciated.\n\nIf you're on the fence, there's some more reviews by Autistic folks on the episode 1/2 discussion and other posts that may give you some more insight on whether or not you will like it.",

There's a bunch of Korean shows that I've watched which were good but I skipped Woo because the Netflix preview wasn't good.\n\nHmm, some info here https://www.filmcompanion.in/features/extraordinary-attorney-woo-review-netflix-wild-card-the-unexpected-charm-park-eun-bin/:  *\"EAW\u2019s writing is excellent and its supporting cast is fantastic, but the heavy lifting in the show is being done by Park, whose performance of oddness is rich with tenderness, sensitivity and humour. She is able to lift Young-woo out of the clich\u00e9s surrounding autism despite her performance being rooted in those very same clich\u00e9s. As Young-woo, Park holds her body with a certain tension that suggests awkwardness and makes you want to protect this peculiar, beautiful woman who relates more to whales than humans. For Young-woo\u2019s voice, Park has found an even pitch that despite its flatness, sounds richly emotive, particularly when she\u2019s delivering punchlines in a comedic setup. But it\u2019s in the moments of stillness, when Young-woo is quietly trying to decode the world around her and her place within it, that Park really shines. In a recent interview, Park said that she rejected the role of Young-woo multiple times because she was afraid and didn\u2019t want her performance to \u201churt others\u2019 feelings\u201d. Director Yoo In-shik waited a year for Park because he was convinced she was the right person to play the role. Watching EAW, you can see why.\"*",

A lot is down to the actors but the feel of the show is just so good for a Kdrama. It's just a nice and relaxing show to watch, it doesn't go too hard on the drama side of things, there is tension but it never takes you out of enjoying the tone of the show or the charm of it's leading actress.   \n\n\nOnce you watch a few Kdramas it feels like you've seen them all and while Extraordinary Attorney Woo does fall in with the usual character types at times it's managed to deliver something fresh to the genre.",

I struggled to see any chemistry in the manager couple -- both characters felt a little one-note and contrived to me. I feel like there was potential there, that just wasn't quite reached. I can't decide if the script didn't give them the right opportunities or if the actors missed them.\n\nI would like to come back to this one again in the future when I have more dramas under my belt. I clearly need to watch more romances, because I didn't get any of the confession references.",

Somehow I ended up with around ten in progress. Some are airing now so I don\u2019t have much choice (**Dr. Cha**, **The Real Has Come**, **Perfect Stranger**) but others have been lingering either because they hit that third quarter plot lag, I barely started but got disappointed/distracted, or I felt like watching a different genre. A couple only had one episode left. \n\nRecently completed lingering dramas:\n* **Coffee Prince** Really good, and ahead of it\u2019s time in terms of the plot. \n* **Kill Me Heal Me** Amazing ML makes it worth it, my least favorite FL is less than usual awful. \n* **Rooftop Prince** Lots of silly but also surprisingly serious and really enjoyable. \n* **Lawless Lawyer** Pretty good but not great, just got distracted. \n\nTaking slowly to prolong my enjoyment:\n* **Dali and the Cocky Prince** This one is going on my top ten list and I plan to rewatch it soon. *Soooo good!*\n* **Joseon Attorney** I\u2019m enjoying watching Woo Do Hwan basically carry this drama. \n\nAnd some I\u2019m going to finish for sake of completeness though they\u2019re pretty meh:\n* **Strong Woman Do Bong Soon** FL is way too abusive and so is her mother. \n* **My Strange Hero** It should be good but is somehow missing something.",

Seo In Guk is funny, cute, and sincere as Louis - with all the mannerisms, voice, and expressions that make the character someone we recognise instantly and become sweetly familiar with. Lee Jun Ho is deeply affecting and completely convincing as Kang Doo, and so good-looking! They both are, of course. I really like Jun Ho's look as Kang Doo in this - much better than the over-polished look in his upcoming series, for example.\n\nAnyway, both captivating shows. \ud83d\udc4d",

So much great music to enjoy!  \n\nMy favourites include a few you mentioned, so here's a short list you can try out:   \nStranger (both seasons), Flower of Evil(enjoy the instrumentals more than the songs or the show itself!), Misty ( my #1 favourite), My Mister (my other #1), Signal (couple of really amazing ones here particularly Tracking) and Money Flower.  \n\nI have a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1aETFlbUZfhLTQoI1IyYRY) you can check out if interested - it does not have Misty, Signal or My Mister because I listen to the whole OST every now and then. I add to this list the songs I liked after finishing a show or from Spotify's  Discover Weekly.  \n \nMost dramas release their OST on Spotify, some are released as one album while others are released by each part (separate songs). But in most cases once a show is over, the whole album is released. If you cant find a show using its english name, try searching by its korean/hangul name (you can find it on its MDL page). \n\nHappy hunting :)",

For example, if you like **Beauty Inside** and want to watch more shows with *prospopagnosia* as a storyline, there\u2019s a tag for that. \n\nOnce you watch a lot of shows it can be difficult to remember which one is which, especially when a drama may be listed by a different English name depending on the platform. For example, *Just Between Lovers* on Viki is listed as *Rain or Shine* on Netflix (and it\u2019s excellent!).  \n\nIf you post to ask for recommendations it helps to link your MDL so you don\u2019t receive suggestions for a bunch of shows you\u2019ve already seen. Some nice people on this subreddit (or r/kdramarecommends) will look at your MDL and give thoughtful recommendations. \n\nIf you spend time on this sub I strongly advise you to watch **The Heirs** (Inheritors on Netflix). Several of the weekly post themes are a reference to that drama, for example \u201cKim Tan\u2019s Talk Time\u201d, and you\u2019ll understand a lot of the references if you\u2019ve seen it. Plus everyone should be exposed to the sartorial and coiffure stylings of the splendid Lee Min Ho. \n\nI hope you enjoy your kdrama journey! My recommendation is to give a variety of dramas a try to get a feel for your interests and try both current release and older (**Dr. Cha** and **Secret Garden**), modern and saeguk (**Search: WWW** and **Rookie Historian**), standard season (16 episodes) and long (50+ episodes), light (**Backstreet Rookie**) and heavy (**Glory**, **D.P.**).",

It's my first Park Seo-joon drama, I'd only seen him on Jinny's Kitchen before. Objectively, I can see why this isn't the best drama. For example, it is ridiculous that the female lead is considered ugly when she just has frizzy hair and red cheeks, she's actually really cute.

It\u2019s ridiculous but in a good way. Find it hard to believe it\u2019s from 2015 as it definitely gives off a late 2000s vibe.",

But they just shoved it full of filler which didn't really make any of the storylines more satisfying.\n\nLoved the first three episodes. Loved the last ten minutes. The rest was okay but not memorable.",

In both seasons it is established that the villagers can't leave the village, but at the end of episode 12 of S1, the kids playing under the bridge clearly go through the barrier, presumably leading into the complex in S2. How were they able to get out of the complex? Also, this is a different entrance/exit from the one we see in S2. Was this ever addressed?",

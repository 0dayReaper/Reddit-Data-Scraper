(And why?)\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we  encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they dropped certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas  without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all.  This serves to both inform others who may be wary of certain aspects of dramas they wish to avoid and others who have watched the dramas in full  may be able to encourage users to pick up dramas again in the future if  the problems they had were only momentary aspects of the drama.\n\n**Please remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.** \n\n***Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.***\n\nWhen participating in this discussion remember, whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. **Be kind to one another.**\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted.

It is all over the place and it rushed their back story from the beginning. It's like they pulled bits and pieces from a bunch of fantasy k-dramas and threw them into the script and none of them quite stick. The actors have had their work cut out for them. \n\nA side note , I know plastic surgery is as prevalent in Korea as it is in America. But the plastic surgeon that did the FL's nose messed up her nostril sizing so bad and you can tell they tried to do camera angles to not show them both at the same time, but every time it happens it's jumps out at me. What has been seen can't be unseen.",

It was pretty clear what was \"love\" and what was \"loyalty\" for the FL. She was never head over heels for one of the guys and in my opinion they made it very obvious, that it was more like&gt;!\"we know each other for so long, trust each other and can count on each other, let's stay together as family and get married\"!&lt;. I think there was actually a conversation like this between them and at least the FL felt nothing more than that. But many got upset online. So if you get on the wrong boat, the show will let you down.\n\nI really liked it and it got a bit darker towards the end also. When they showed how everyone ended up in the agency. I liked the characters as well, but the FL was annoying at times. But Kim Min-jae was good as always and kept the show together.",

That too a junior one (since korean society is so gossipy about it) and one who doesnt believe in marriage which ure so hell bent on? Like really? Also theres no reason the ML and FL fall for each other, whats made them like the other so much theyre dating? Because hes good at weather predictions which is literally his job? They just jumped straight into broke up and dating the new guy without any build up to WHY she fell for.him so much shes willing to risk her work reputation again over a boy she hasnt discussed big life things with and tbh doesnt even know that well!!",

Also, I couldn't see the leadsas a romantic couple at ALL. Still started season 2, I guess I still have hope for the show as a whole because I like almost everyone in the cast.\n\nThe Killer's Shopping List: \nCharming, but never quite funny, and the mystery was a bit dull to holdmy intrest. Also the main couple dynamic's felt INSUFFERABLE \nDropped a few months ago, but I always forget to talk to talk about it, lol. \n\nIsland :\n I was sooooo looking foword to this show and I dropped it about 10 minutes in. The VIBES were off, it felt too polished and lacking actual substance. I didn't give it a proper chance I guess, but it just felt off in a boring way. I almost never like  a show that opens w exposition narration, ugh\n\nMight drop Remartige and Desire, just because I keep forgetting to watch it. It's an ok show, though",

It just feels unnecessary and clashes so much with the tone of the rest of the show. You can tell that it's just there to fill out time since the main plot isn't that deep. Also idk... the leads have chemistry but the way we got to our first kiss felt so cheap to me (don't want to go into too much detail bc spoilers). Between that and the main conflict being the scary stalker now, I've kind of lost interest.\n\nI also dropped **The Forbidden Marriage** (though maybe that was last month I can't remember haha). I really liked the first couple episodes because the directing was WILD to me. Practically every scene was shot like a music video--I legit thought there would be some kind of Bollywood dance number happening any minute. And those trippy dream scenes!!! But all that weirdness almost immediately went away after week one and it became more of a conventional fusion sageuk--which I always seem to have trouble finishing even when I like them.",

It's a very archetypal superhero set-up, and there's enough of that in Western media that it wasn't compelling or realistic compared to more character driven Kdrama romances.\n\nThe political plot and the insight into journalism in South Korea are what redeemed the show for me, but if you made to to EP11 and aren't feeling it you definitely gave it more than a fair shot!",

So many terrible things have happened to the family in this drama, that I was incredibly relieved it was all &gt;!just a dream!&lt;.\n* \"I'll find you someone better than Mi-joo.\" Well, Young-soon, I'm afraid that such a person does not exist. Not that it stopped the village chief's wife from relishing the opportunity to do some styling work on Kang-ho. And once again, I was impressed by Lee Do-hyun inhabiting the mannerisms of a seven-year-old in those ill-fated matchmaking scenes.\n* Oh, my goodness. I didn't know how much I needed that scene at Mi-joo's nail salon. First, there was her admirable, tough-as-nails (no pun intended) handling of that creepy customer. Then, we had a classic ML saves the FL from a stray motorcycle scene, as Kang-ho's memory returned at the perfect moment. And finally, the &gt;!kiss!&lt;, and Young-soon hurriedly vacating the scene. Swoonworthy in the best possible way.\n* \"I wanted to make you happy. So why won't you let me do what I want to do? Why do you always decide for me?\" Kang-ho spoke for many viewers in that scene.\n* Mi-joo's selflessness in allowing Kang-ho to pursue revenge, with the expectation of reuniting again, only for this plan to be derailed by a misunderstanding outside the courthouse, and subsequently placing the burden of raising the twins upon her mother, was another heartbreaking scene.\n* I was blown away by Ahn Eun-jin's performance in this episode. And that last scene, followed by that wonderful soundtrack song playing over the end credits, was the perfect ending to an almost-perfect episode.",

Ngl, they got me at the opening scene (glad &gt;!it was just a dream!&lt;), but we finally got that Mi-Joo Kang-Ho time that we really needed in this episode.\n\nI was finally willing to forget (mind you, not FORGIVE) the things Young-Soon did to her son, &gt;!but she's doing it all over again!&lt;. She knows she practically ruined her son's life by forcing things upon him, yet here she is, making decisions for him,&gt;! AGAIN!!!&lt;. So much for 'chance given from above'. \n\nI guess we already knew&gt;! the twins were his!&lt;, so not much of a surprise there but it still hit differently when she admitted it out loud. I'm really glad that &gt;!she finally talked to someone about her story (and Kang-Ho and the twins)!&lt;. Guys!!! Do you realize that &gt;!Ye-Jin's first crush is her dad!&lt;!!!! That's soo sweet, though I'm worried how the 'news' might affect the poor kid. Seo-Jin's reaction to the 'Horrifying Bastard', now that's something I'd like to see. Those guys better come up with a comic reaction rather than a sentimental one.\n\nOne more thing......IS IT JUST ME OR DOES NONE OF YOU WANT TO SEE THE YAKUZA LADY WITHOUT HER FACE SHEETS ON!?",

My wild theory was that the lady + baby + fish market ahjussi all somehow get killed on their way to get to the bigger boat - killed by maybe Taek's father or assemblyman folks (or both?).\n\nAnd so on the next day, Kang Ho keeps getting calls from the fish market place (from the fish market guy's wife presumably?) - because fish market ahjussi is now dead. Dunno. This show always has the craziest ending shots!!",

It was brilliantly executed, because it filled in the gaps in the context from the first time those scenes were shown to us. In other words, it assembled the puzzle pieces and tied up loose ends. Some of these confirmed our initial interpretation, while others were subverted.\n* Furthermore, it did have those **Beyond Evil** criminal investigation vibes that I was expecting, right down to the distinctive guitar instrumental soundtrack.\n* The most heartbreaking scenes from the flashback were of Young-soon throwing Kang-ho's artwork into the fire, when it was once her dream that he become an artist. Hae-sik's murder really upended lives in an instant.\n* Those scenes were closely followed on the heartbreak scale by Kang-ho struggling to justify his own rationale for leaving Mi-joo.\n* \"Be polite to his mother. And remember what I told you earlier.\" Tae-soo is a truly bone-chilling villain.",

I feel like deep down she doesn\u2019t feel good enough because, to be fair, she\u2019s always ready and very willing to give way more than what she\u2019s comfortable receiving. For instance, she was making money to get KH through uni, but when he left she didn\u2019t tell him about the twins not to burden him. I believe she said she doesn\u2019t want to be a burden anymore (this implies she always felt that way to a degree), thing which isn\u2019t true. If anything, considering all she has done, he should\u2019ve been the burden on her, not the other way around .\n\nI noticed she\u2019s very emotionally intelligent. And I believe the relationship between her mother and father traumatised her and set the bar about how she needs to be treated pretty low. Let\u2019s not forget that her father wanted a son, and she came out to be a girl. And I think the disappointment is another thing that affected her. \n\nHaving KH betraying her (not cheat but betray), wounded her deeper than what the show exploring or showing. I feel like she loves him so much still, but also her low self-esteem plays a big roll in how much she\u2019s willing to forget and forgive and how much she\u2019s willing to give in relation to what she receives in return\u2026",

The reason why he stopped communicating with everyone is because he didn\u2019t want to have anyone close enough in case they wanted to harm him or manipulate him through them. Him being married, his legal wife (even if he doesn\u2019t love her) is a liability. He can\u2019t just ignore that he\u2019d be basically risking her life if he continues on with his plan. \n\nThat\u2019s what his mother wants from this marriage. A way for him to make it impossible to continue on down this path. Even under these conditions. Plus, I don\u2019t think any wife that consideres him for a groom to push him to be\u2026 sexually actively until he\u2019s ready.",

I was like, \"Why are you like this? Again?\" \n\nBut then that's also what the show is pointing out. That she's realising she's made so many mistakes in her life, especially when it has come to raising her son. I'm not excusing any of it, I'm just saying she is a very flawed character and she is very regularly had to face some very hard truths about the problems she's caused and the damage she's inflicted on her son through her actions. Ra Mi Ran being such a tremendous actress has allowed her character's pain and heartbreak to shine through effortlessly and we cry with her despite being unable to understand her actions often times. \n\nShe's trying to fix things the second time around, but it sucks &gt;!that it's just about too late and I don't know what kind of person I'm going to become when they kill her off at some point of the show as they must (Idk if Stage 4 cancer is something we can come back from, even Chae Song Hwa might not be able to help there).!&lt; But yeah, it's really sucky that so many of these problems that she is discovering about how she raised Kang Ho have come to light now (I suppose better late than never) - but I wished they didn't have to live such a hard life all along! Both of them &lt;/3 My heart breaks for them, it really does.   \n\n\nStill, a real masterpiece though, this show. Keeps me guessing, and I never know what's to come next. It's really fun, and gripping story-telling. I'm excited and terrified of what's to come.",

I thought we already had a decent idea of the past but added more depth and colour than I could've ever. &gt;!You know that the past was too harsh if it takes you dedicating your entire life to revenge. And it sucks even more that you have to throw your life away to even reach the same step as those who harmed you without a second thought. I respect his mom thinking that the best revenge is moving on but that definitely feels like accepting defeat to me. Him gaining his memories will be the most insane turning point and it looks like Mi-joo will be the key.!&lt;\n\nEP10: Starting the episode like that is pure evil. \n\nAnd gosh I loved all of it so much. &gt;!Mi-joo and Kang-oh's chemistry is undeniable, literally made for eachother. That kiss gave me butterflies and the fact she returned it melted me. Our girl stayed strong for long enough and now it's time to stamp her foot to claim what's her.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The highlight tho, I'M SO GLAD THE TWINS ARE HIS!&lt;",

            "comment": "I don't think Young Soon's judgment call at the end of ep 9 was very sound either but man people have to understand it's not that simple. Young Soon is POOR AF. She makes a modest living and no connections, no power, no resources to take on a long running revenge plot. She has been downtrodden all her life. She is up against TWO separate entities who do have tons of what she lacks and make power plays in their sleep. She is simply doing what many poor people around the world do every day. We don't have to agree with the decision, just understand all the factors that come into that decision. \n\nWe all have mothers right? Do you think your own mom would let you guys take on a situation that would potentially cost you your life? You'd be lucky to have a mom that let you face that challenge head on, most wouldn't and would stop at nothing to shield their child from that danger however cowardly it seemed to an onlooker.\n\nAnd for those saying it doesn't add up why she wanted Kang Ho to become a prosecutor and why she seemingly walked it all back in this episode... I don't think so? Young Soon just wanted Kang Ho to become a somebody so he wouldn't suffer the same indignities she's fated to suffer for the rest of her life. That's all. I don't think she ever intended for him to exact her revenge for her. She only blurted out that thing about wanting to understand why her husband died in a moment of passion. I don't think she ever expected Kang Ho to take her at her word but by the looks of it he did.",

She had to focus on surviving and raising her child as a pig farmer, and she witnessed how \u201cthe world\u201d looked down upon her husband because of their status. \n\nI spent the last two+ years in therapy unpacking my own family\u2019s story, my complicated relationship with my parents, my childhood, complex trauma, ancestral and Intergenerational trauma, and my anger towards imperialism, exploitative systems, and injustice. There are many things that still trigger me and are hard to forgive when it comes to my family, but I have grown to accept and understand what is\u2026 and am learning to be at peace. Multiple truths can exist. \n\nWe don\u2019t have to like Young Soon. We can be angry at how she treated her son. But I do understand her. I can\u2019t unsee the interconnectedness of our collective grief and traumas under greed, war, violence, and class divisions. I can\u2019t help but see her story from a place of love and compassion but also profound sorrow. \n\nBad mother, good mother, bad child, good child. Who decides and judges? Young Soon was once a child.\n\nThis is a very sad drama. I, too, long for more slice of life moments with their village community and hope everyone finds happiness! I truly believe that we can\u2019t only rely on our immediate family to learn and understand love and loving relationships, and I love that Mijoo was a bright light for Kang Ho.\n\nThis drama tugs at my heart and makes me experience alll the emotions while I insert and relive my own experiences as I watch.",

We don't understand a lot of her actions a lot of the times, and often the things she does are frustrating and heartbreaking - at best. But I don't think I ever truly appreciated just how many devastating things she's had to go through herself. It's not just the one event or the once piece of trauma - she's been abandoned and left alone and suffered injustice over, and over, and over again - what she is today is simply a coping mechanism, a survival mechanism of sorts to just somehow get her through life the best way she knows how. She's got to stay standing and she simply knows no other way to get to that level of safety and security - and that's why she pushes it all on Kang Ho. \n\nDoesn't work at all like she intends for it to of course, but she also has to repeatedly and painfully face the consequences of her mistakes several times as well. And what I admire about her is that she doesn't give up. She chooses to go on, and try and course-correct - do the best with what she knows. She's far from perfect, but she keeps on getting back up and being as strong as she possibly can and for that, she is remarkable!",

            "comment": "I believe many viewers approach this show with a rather superficial lens. However, this isn't a fantasy-based drama where the effects of a mother's abuse can be fully resolved or compensated for, nor will it culminate in a traditionally cheerful ending. Instead, the narrative's depth lies in its nuanced, grayscale tones, showcasing the trials of characters striving for even the slightest improvements in their relationships within their limited time frames. It doesn't depict the journey of characters turning entirely virtuous or becoming perfect parents; rather, it paints a picture of a realistic parent-child relationship marred by toxic growth.\n\nSome viewers seem discontented with the mother character's flaws and Kang Ho's choice to maintain a connection with her. However, it's important to remember that Kang Ho never forgave his mother; he merely stated that he understood her. Kang Ho, too, faced severe discrimination before his transition to a prosecutor, a life paralleling his mother's, which likely helped him discern the factors that shaped her character. This family is marked by wounds so deep they might persist for generations, hence expecting a healthy relationship among them isn't realistic.\n\nThe most they can hope for is finding fleeting moments of happiness in their remaining time together. Given Kang Ho's injuries and his mother's illness, their remaining days are both precious and limited. Remember, the drama's Korean title directly translates to \"Bad Mother,\" indicating a core theme that is far from the traditional happy family narrative.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that many of you are imposing your personal circumstances onto the narrative, obstructing your capacity to genuinely engage with the story and resulting in undue criticism. I don't mean to offend, but there's an irony here: some of you are, in fact, mirroring the actions of Kang Ho's mother by projecting your personal experiences and expectations onto others. It's essential to approach this story with an open mind, allowing the narrative to unfold as intended, rather than viewing it through the lens of personal bias.",

The beauty of stories, especially that touch on social issues, relationships, and have complex layers, is that they often touch people\u2019s hearts. Some viewers might see themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, empathize, or aspire to be like someone, etc. For me, I feel for Young Soon in the same way I love my mother and grieve her experiences. My personal experiences lead me to understand her.\n\nI personally like Young Soon\u2019s character- even though her actions towards her son is hard to watch, I also understand that it\u2019s a fictional story with nuance.\n\nI am in my 30s, and the people I\u2019ve talked to the most IRL about kdramas are my partner\u2019s mother, an older woman I met at a museum, and an old friend from college. I\u2019ve always loved stories- from films and books to anime and video games. I started watching kdramas 5 years ago and am newer to Reddit. I go to this community to read interesting insights and reactions, and also to find people who both align with and challenge my perspective. So it\u2019s refreshing to read comments like yours.

He lost his love and almost his life for that.!&lt; Come on, ajumma!\n\nActually nothing much happened in this ep because we saw what we already guessed would have happened. Kang-ho &gt;!having his own revenge plan.!&lt; But I'm so happy that we saw Kang-ho and Mi-joo as a couple again no matter how short it was. Lee Do-hyun and Ahn Eun-jin look adorable together. I'm very sad tho cause we didn't see much of the twins today. They're just sunshine in human form and are definitely Mi-joo and Kang-ho's kids.\n\nNo matter how much of an explanation and backstory we get I'll never be fully able to sympathise with Kang-go's mom cause of the shit she put him through. How can you make a teenaged boy bear the unbearable weight of your husband's death and get my sympathy? But it gives a new dimension to Young-soon and shows the harsh reality of Asian households where abuse is a cycle.\n\nBut what was that ending tho?? Are they implying that &gt;!the girl Kang-ho tried to save has actually been killed? What about the baby? Is it why the restaurant owner called him on that fateful day?!&lt; I need answers.\n\nAlso can't wait for tomo because as much as I'm happy that Young-soon understood why her son was cold to her I also want to know her reaction to Kang-ho and Mi-joo's relationship. Please put two and two together and understand that those kids are Kang-ho's. It ain't a big deal to the female Sherlock who deduced that her husband was murdered. I definitely want to see a flashback of Mi-joo deciding to keep the kids and not tell Kang-ho. It's a necessity",

At this point, it's their story that keeps me going. \n\nHopefully,&gt;! the mom and the kid won't die. They got in some accident but somehow escaped. I mean, they can't kill her. She's major evidence against Tae-Soo (even if Kang-Ho secured the DNA evidence).!&lt;\n\nIt's still great that both mother and her son understand each other's feelings. Still hate her though.",

She's the prototype who thinks that she does everything for her kid even though the said kid is severely hurt in the process. Good that Kang-ho finally confronted her but she's still adamant about setting him up. I wanna throw hands fr!\n\nBut the best part of this drama is not the central relationship of Kang-ho and his mom. It's definitely Kang-ho and Mi-joo. My dear Mi-joo! She's everything good and pure and an example of a strong female character without having to portray her as rude. I adore Eun-jin here so much even more than Hospital Playlist. When she covered her face with a plastic bag to hide from Kang-ho I lold so hard. She finally let the cat out of the bag and told her mom that Kang-ho's the dad but looks like her mom is against it. Why can my girl not catch a break at all? Every time Kang-ho remembers his relationship with Mi-joo my heart flutters, just like Ye-jin's and I almost cried when Kang-ho drew Mi-joo just like he used to. \n\n**I'm gonna burn down JTBC's office if Kang-ho and Mi-joo don't get a happy ending.**",

Kangho has yet to regain his memory, discover he is the twin\u2019s father or made up with Mijoo for the pain he caused her. The revenge plot has taken a backseat for far too long. At this point, the formula feels repetitive. Even Sam-Sik keeps stealing things all of the time without learning from the consequences of his actions. Something must be wrong when the villains have had more or less the same screen time as a secondary character like the composer guy. \n\nFrom looks of the preview, it seems like Mijoo will finally come forward and reveal the truth about her kid\u2019s parentage.

Abuse is abuse even when the motivation was righteous (I won't bring myself to write that she was right). I really hoped that they would break a pattern of kids accepting everything from their parents.\n\nStill, I must say that Young Soon had SOME character development (still not enough to be a redemption arc). Throughout the series we learned that her grief influenced Kang Ho's life so wholesomely that it shaped his career, private choices and stripped him of a future with a loved one. Now she told him &gt;!to give up revenge, because the real revenge would be to live happily and forget everything. BUT it might be just a realization that in his current state he is not an avenger he could be.!&lt;\n\nTo be honest I don't really understand one thing - &gt;!did Kang Ho name Mi Joo as his loved one in his digital diary? Okay, he asked hist mother not to let her know about his true feelings, but if Young Soon isn't stupid she should be able to do the math about the twins (if they are Kang Ho's). In the meantime in the preview of the next episodes we saw the whole village setting him up on blind dates!&lt;. Something's fishy, have to wait for the next episode.\n\nAnd if we're close to the ocean, &gt;!I was kind of surprised that the woman from the car ended up drowned.!&lt; My prediction is Kang Ho may go to jail at some point and face betrayal in court just as his father did.\n\nSo yeah, I'm all hooked and can't wait for tomorrow.",

They teach this in therapy lol. No it doesn't mean \"normalizing\" what they did or suddenly being okay with it. It's just understanding the why so that you don't become consumed by bitterness and resentment which doesn't lead anywhere (and which is apparently so rampant in this thread). He spent years hating his mom and it's only natural that with growth and maturity he was curious to understand the root of her behavior rather than continue to be bitter about it",

In a textbook world, the mother does deserve to be punished but in the real one, especially here in the east, that doesn't happen. Kids realise what their parents are doing to them is wrong, but we kids at the end of the day do still love them. Kang ho's mum caused him a lot of pain but somewhere inside of him, he knew it was all out of love and worry.The fear of your child ending up in a bad position in society is heavy and very strong. So, I understand why it drove her to the point that it did.This is a very realistic portray of a very loving mother who's husband passed away tragically and lost pretty much everything at a crucial point in her life in a country where mental health is a joke people make on TV.  Not everyone is privileged enough to have dreams. She knew that kang ho wasn't because of their financial stress. She knew she couldn't foster any of his interests for him but his education. So she did exactly that. making sure that he got to a point in life where HE COULD choose to do anything.\n\nFrom the first episode I've noticed that she's genuinely not greedy and truly wants just the best for kang ho. She is the perfect reality of a lot of asian mothers especially given the fact that she raised him in the 90s.  \n\n\nShe has good intentions but bad executions. Hence, The Good Bad Mother.",

If those 2 still have to stick around looking for the evidence, it might be more of a reason for kang ho to be kept alive. plus it means that the evidence doesn't go into the wrong hands (there is proof that kang ho was also collecting evidence against woobyeok. If word gets out, Song woo byeok may also try to kill Kang ho).!&lt;",

That was hypocrisy at its peak. First you destroyed your son's life and now you burned all his hard work.

I fully agree with the comments about how youngsoon continues to overstep her boundaries &amp; that kangho\u2019s childhood was indeed filled w abuse and must be acknowledged as so. But this kind of parenting is deeply embedded in our culture so much that a lot of Koreans are blind to the toxicity of it and believe it to be normal. At the same time, it is complex because there is so much love at the root of this parenting style that has been formed by generational trauma and culture. The love that many Korean parents have for their children is utterly selfless, sacrificial, and emotional. \n\nEvery episode is filled with the heart aching love and loyalty that a lot of us feel toward our own parents and it\u2019s like therapy for me lol",

            "comment": "My thoughts this week:\n\n1. The twins are AMAZING. Every second of them on-screen is gold. The actress playing Se-jin was in \"Our Blues\" and she was truly brilliant. I was looking forward to seeing what she would do next, and here she is.\n2. I love the townspeople. They don't move the plot much, but their antics and busybody ways are just so lovable. I loved how they dressed up in all their finery for days just to find a bride for Kang-ho. Yes, it's terrible that Sam-sik is such a thief that he would exploit a brain-damaged \"friend\" to steal his wedding jewelry. But his derpy expressions are just so funny.\n3. I love seeing Kim Won-hae having convulsions over the town banner, and Sam-sik's parents constantly insulting their own son. And the actress playing Mi-joo's mom is just... I love this actress so much, and she's just so good at playing this country ajuma with her ramyun-perm wig. Every actor is just so good here.\n4. Yes, in Korean, the title is simply, \"Bad Mother.\" I wonder about the choice to make \"The *Good* Bad Mother\" the official English title. Usually, the title is a direct translation, or it's some vague English phrase that has nothing to do with the original title. (E.g., \"Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food Often\" --&gt; \"Something in the Rain\") So I find it curious that the English title isn't simply, \"Bad Mother.\" It's as if Netflix, the production, or whoever decided they wanted to temper her image, somehow, for the English-speaking audience, while the original title is fine for the Korean-speaking audience.\n5. I love reading this sub! I love all the balanced and varied views. When I read about this show on other sites, there is an unbelievable amount of judgment towards Kang-ho's mom and how horrible they think she is. She is just awful and her impending death is well-deserved. She can't die soon enough. And reading that makes me go HRMMMM.\n6. She is what she is. She is not a bad person. It's clear that she had a brutally difficult life full of tragedy, and her survival skills are strong. It's notable that her phone ringtone is \"I'm Happy,\" the same song that was playing from her father's car radio minutes before her entire family died. She purposely reminds herself of that day everytime her phone rings. She named her farm \"Happy Farm.\"\n7. When she was told by her doctor that she is dying, it was clear that she would do anything she could to make Kang-ho walk again. So I wasn't shocked by her curtly telling him to get up when he fell out of wheelchair, and when she threw him into the water. Yes, it's very harsh. But she was dying, she has no time left, and she wants to make sure he can survive without her.\n8. Instead of judging her, I simply understand that she is just... what she is. The brief moment of happiness she had with her husband was cut short, and she could never rely on anyone. She had to be hard on herself in order to raise her child. She raised him to be the same way. If her husband had lived and she didn't have to be so desperate for survival, there's no doubt that she would have been a more indulgent mother. It's clear that tragic circumstances made her what she is. And despite how her harsh upbringing has hurt him, he is in fact a very strong person who is resourceful and smart.\n9. The SD CARD. I was shocked when she threw that into the fire! But my guess is that Kang-ho, before the accident, was smart enough to have stashed evidence elsewhere. I think the SD card was specifically for his mother.\n10. As a mother myself, I think there is a urge for society to judge mothers in general. I recently read an article about co-sleeping (sleeping with your baby in bed) and how that is advised against because a parent might accidently crush and suffocate their baby. So most people claim that they never do this, but secretly, many actually do.\n11. Another issue that I dealt with when my kids were babies was how society also judged whether the baby was breastfed. Some mothers pump milk and feed the baby with the bottle, but they felt judged because people might assume it was formula, and felt the need to clarify that it was actually breastmilk in that bottle. What if it was formula? That is totally legit and why should anyone care?\n12. What it made me think about was how public judgment shames moms so much that they have to feel shame about the perfectly legit and well-meaning choices they make about their child, and how completely strangers feel free to judge these choices. And I feel that that actually kind of extends to judgment of Kang-ho's mother as well. Yes, she is a fictional character in a Korean drama speaking Korean. And yet...\n13. I found it interesting that in the preview, Mi-joo hugged her twins and said, \"I'm a bad mother.\" We now know what she went through, and the struggles she had to endure. She didn't want to leave her babies, but she had to. Life is hard, but Moms are amazing. That's what this show makes me feel.",

He just allowed the rumours to continue for 'noise marketing' i.e. as a way to allow his company to be in the spotlight. It worked. He achieved massive success and now has the time to set his sights on Bong Soon. \ud83e\udd2d",

Also, he recognized that being super strong doesn't mean that she was invincible. \n\nI also liked that she was allowed to be both super strong physically *and* feminine and sweet. I love that she cried so desperately in the drama. I feel like it's so relatable (plus she's a great crier). \n\nSometimes \"superhero\" characters in US seem just too tough overall. Like if you're strong physically, you have to also be shut down emotionally. Why?",

For instance this trope of FL having a slave contract (because of owing money  or other) and turning into ML\u2019s maid. Sometimes FL has to work or desguise as secretary, even if she has another superior background and will work bringing coffee and making bow ties for ML.\n\n I am not a feminist in the strict sense  but I plead for respect among human beings, independently of gender, social, economical, ethnic or cultural condition. Media over the world is infiltrated by the overall intolerance of our society.",

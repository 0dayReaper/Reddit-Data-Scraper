            "comment": "I finally took everyone's recommendations and watched **Her Private Life** (2019, 16 eps), and I just flat out enjoyed it for the most part. It won't stick in my head too much, but it was sweet and romantic and a great ensemble cast, plus, as promised by this sub, the skinship is top notch.\n\nIn fact, a note about the skinship: the OTP - Kim Jae-wook as artist Ryan Gold and Park Min-young as curator Sung Deok-mi (who's also secretly a fangirl for Cha Shia (Jung Je-Won, or \"One\"), who's just an adorable cinnamon roll throughout) - is enemies-to-lovers, and once they actually get to the latter part of that, they consistently demonstrate sincere affection for each other. All the little glances and touches that couples give each other when they're in love are there.\n\nThe skinship isn't any more explicit than most broadcast kdramas, they're still just kissing and holding hands, etc., but it's actually passionate when the scene calls for passion, or affectionate, or comforting... they don't declare their undying love for each other and then exchange an A-frame hug with a tentative pat on the back. In fact, Ryan's height compared to Deokmi makes his hugs just enfold her in love and comfort. Their hugs are #relationshipgoals.\n\nPlus, their relationship is just very supportive. There's a lot of emotional stuff going on (too much, if you ask me) and the characters by and large talk their way through it! They're supportive of each other, sensitive to each others' emotions and residual trauma! There's forgiveness!\n\nThe cast is stellar all the way down. Nam Eun-gi (Ahn Bo Hyun) is the 2ML, and he's wonderful as an Olympic medalist in judo who is trying to execute the friends-to-lovers trope but fails. The fangirl best friend Lee Seon-joo (Park Jin-joo), and my surprise absolute favorite character: Cindy (Kim Bo-Ra), another fangirl but just the sassiest cool chick ever. The parents are entertainingly quirky with their addictions to knitting and collecting rocks, and the art! The art is so wonderful.\n\nI watched this right after **Dali &amp; Cocky Prince**, so maybe \"art curator\" should be my dream job. Both dramas had gorgeous and compelling original artwork in them, and both had interesting meditations on what art means to us and how our reactions to art changes as our emotions change.\n\nWhile the fangirl scenes made me cringe a little (fawning over celebrities is just not something of which I'm emotionally capable), and scenes of the teenaged fangirls make me think they all need a ton of therapy, it was ultimately pretty harmless, especially once the overly emotional \"we all met in childhood\" plots start kicking in.\n\nJust a good, solid romantic drama, imo. And damn, Kim Jae-wook... if I *were* going to fawn over a celebrity, you can't pick better!",

I think Kim Jae-uck and Park Min-young have incredible chemistry and they\u2019re just as good together [when they\u2019re just being themselves](https://youtu.be/Ka6KaWg-bbE).\n\nAnd here\u2019s a compilation of their [skinship scenes](https://youtu.be/aFHkE4zudtY), including outtakes.\n\nIf you like Kim Jae-uck, I highly recommend **Crazy Love** (rom-com), **Voice** (psychological thriller), **The Guest** (horror), **Coffee Prince** (rom-com starring Gong Yoo), and **Antique** (comedy).\n\nETA \u2014 Fun fact: Kim Jae-uck said that half of their scenes were adlibbed, including the scarf untangling scene and the sujebi cooking scene. Park Min-young said that they added lots of unscripted kisses and the script for the sujebi scene was simply, \u201cThe two of you have fun together.\u201d And boy did they ever!",

I would have loved more scary Ryan on his journey to sweet lover Ryan.\n\nOtherwise the chemistry between the leads is off the charts great.",

I read negative reviews before going in, so my expectations were tempered, but it\u2019s honestly one of my all time favorite dramas.  Cinematography and OST were stellar.  But more importantly I loved the extremely realistic portrayals of college relationships.  Young people with childhood trauma and abysmal communication skills don\u2019t magically get over their shit just because they fall in love.  They make a hot mess of things as they try to move forward.  That\u2019s normal and good.  The characters in **My Liberation Notes**, which I also adored, were a lot older as they fumbled through their dysfunctional relationships.  I\u2019m glad Na-Bi and Jae-Eon had a head start.  They have a better chance of settling down in healthy relationships and starting families someday.  Probably with other people!  But their relationship was still beautiful in its own way.  They were better people at the end than they were at the start.  Real healing is slow and incremental like that.",

Anyway he\u2019s more of a detective than a psychiatrist.) It\u2019s nothing amazing but the characters are charming and it\u2019s entertaining enough that I\u2019ll finish it. Next I\u2019ll probably watch Goblin. I\u2019ve been reading reviews of it for ages (mostly good ones) and it\u2019s time to form my own opinion.",

            "comment": "Bingeing My First First Love as I am stuck at home. Got 6 eps left. I can't remember seeing the FL actress in any other dramas. I know the drama is mediocre on the acting front, but it's still a good study on coming of age, youth, dreams, relationships and friendships. Reading some comments on MDL did make me think how we sometimes expect characters to be perfect and never make any mistakes. But isn't making mistakes pretty common, whether IRL or in fiction?\n\nI keep watching clips of Tae Hyung from Jinny's kitchen. He is such a cutie. I told my husband,who is pretty clueless about K pop and K drama but knows Blackpink and BTS, that V from BTS might be dating Jenny from Blackpink. He replied saying, \" you should say V from BTS is dating J from BP\".  So much for initials! I did eventually point out that there are two J's in BP so it's important to clarify which J we are talking about. And as far as Jisoo is concerned, he isn't allowed to comment. \n\nI think my Lee Junho era is coming back to my life so yay.",

            "comment": "I too watched **XO, Kitty** on Netflix but I liked it. That said:\n\n1. It's an American TV show for American audiences not a Kdrama, an adaption of Kdrama or anything even related to Kdrama really. It's also definitely young adult. Which is fine, but it has that as a target audience so something to keep in mind. \n2. It's not the first in the series, there are 3 movies before this TV spinoff series, and the movies are based on a book series that was first published in 2014. This show isn't really different than the movies.  All those are in the US.\n3. It's written by a Korean-American expressly for Korean-American exposure (the author has said so in the past about the books - not necessarily this show). It definitely employs American tropes and storytelling.  \n4. It was filmed in Seoul in part but I wish they had featured Seoul more. Likewise, I'm not sure who went over the spoken Korean. I know why they used so much English, people needlessly hate subtitles - especially a lot of Americans for some reason, but the Korean felt...strange. I can't put my finger on it other than I think it goes back to being created/written by a Korean-American. \n5. Most of the Korean actors and cameos have American or English speaking world ties in some way. The actor that plays Kitty is Canadian-Chinese-Irish. The actor that plays Minho was raised in Hong Kong and is based in LA now. The actor that plays Alex is a Korean born Australian adoptee. Talk about relating to your character. Regardless I know its tough to act in a language that isn't your first so those that did did a good job.  \n6. Ok Taecyeon. Enough said there. \n7. The soundtrack is fantastic for pop music like the soundtracks for the movies before it. Some Korean and some American. \n8. The actors who played Yuri (Kim Gia) and Minho (Sang Heon Lee) are brother and sister in real life which is interesting. You can definitely tell if they are near one another as they look a lot alike.",

The korean mother talked with her korean daughter in english - in SK. So many of the SK culture in behaviour was abscent and replaced by american  behaviour - it didn't feel authentic. The clothes didn't feel as if it was a kdrama, makeup, etc. It felt out of touch with SK. As if a girl would be allowed to live with three boys in a dormatory? So much taking for granted that the viewers are stupid by beeing unrealistic and catering to a targeted audience that is american and young. Cause this one didn't feel south korean or actually any good. There is a reason why people avoid hollyweird tvseries. It's cause they are out of touch and very fake in inclusivity. If Hollyweird would have been invlusive, they would have accepted that cultures exist and behaviour within cultures are existing. Instead it's erased and we are expected to just forget it? Don't understand the audacity. That's the opposite of inclusivity. It feels like Hollyweird picked up the Kdrama trend and decided to cash in on it. It's bad, cause if they culturally inclusive the show would have been so much better.",

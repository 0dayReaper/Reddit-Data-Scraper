In this episode he seemed a little too pushy to me, especially because he is clearly knowledgeable about &gt;!the death of the guy she was going to marry!&lt;. I know she's going to warm up to him eventually bc plot lol, but I felt a little uncomfortable with how he kept intruding into her space - especially in that last scene when she was &gt;!trying to close the door and he didn't let her. Like irl for me that's a sign to run away, it's giving stalker\ud83d\ude2d!&lt;And the &gt;!\"you're not like other girls\" !&lt;line really had me rolling my eyes...like that for &gt;!not liking FLOWERS????This man has never met a girl that doesn't like flowers??!&lt;\n\nI do like the pacing of this drama though, it doesn't feel too fast or too slow imo and it keeps me interested! I'm not convinved that Yoo-Ha &gt;!is the deposed crown prince though after the flashbacks that we saw of Dan-oh and the younger crown prince. Unless he had some sort of memory loss and didn't remember her before now, because the way he has reacted to the inheritance and the will from his bio father comes off as if he is surprised by all of this. I guess I don't think that it is him because he's been around Dan-oh for so long that it doesn't make sense for him to just now be giving her the cover for the compass. If anything it would be more dangerous for him to give it to her now when she's under a lot of suspicion. With the timeline of how San met Dan-oh, I feel like it makes more sense for him to be the crown prince, and for him to give her the cover isn't as suspicious because he knows that she thinks he's the Watchman. !&lt;But then if that's the case, then &gt;!why would his (Yoo Ah's) bio mom and that one minister be convinced that he's the crown prince? His mother would have no reason to be wrong if she had a relationship with his father (if his father was the previous king). !&lt;\n\nAs of now, my theory is that &gt;!San is the deposed crown prince, Yoo Ah is his younger half-brother (through their fathers relationship with the courtesan) , and Shi Yeol is the Watchman.!&lt; I don't really have a basis to this, it's just my guess\ud83e\udd23\n\n**Ep 8**\n\nThank you writers for giving us more of Kang San in this episode - the &gt;!guarding FML from the sun!&lt; move never fails\ud83e\udd23And the sass when he asked her if &gt;!she wanted to watch him getting treated !&lt;had me dead.\n\nI kinda feel bad for Ban Ya because I feel like if she really does want to be &gt;!Dan-oh's friend, but being threatened to do so kind of spoils that.!&lt;\n\nAnd yayyy Dan-oh finally finds out that San &gt;!is Lee Seol\\~ !&lt;",

And there's also the fact that he has knowledge of healing (back when San got injured) - the Watchmen are warriors, but as the CP's protector it would also make sense for them to have some basic knowledge of healing injuries, especially if he's been watching over San while he was on the run. He was the first of the three to notice Dan Oh's sister in the garden and not fall for the ghost rumor.!&lt; So I think that his flippancy/devil-may-care attitude is just a front.",

            "comment": "Kang San is Yi Seul... :surprised Pikachu face:\n\nGlad they revealed it soon after they have shown Kang in the watchman attire, because honestly, Ryeoun's right eye having a more pronounced double lid than his left makes it a dead give away he wasn't the watchman from eps 2. And if Kang isn't the OG watchman, and ANOTHER watchman saved him in eps 7, then it makes sense he is Yi Seul. He wouldn't have an importance in the plot otherwise.\n\nNow the biggest 'mystery' is who is the OG Watchman. The only real clues we have is his exposed upper face in eps 2 (5:19-5:20 in the Viki version). Considering every other major role is NOT played by a younger actor apart from Dan Oh/Yi Seul, we must assume that the same actor who played the OG Watchman is among the main cast.\n\nSo going by that, we can strike off the majority of the adult cast as the OG Watchman has eyes on the younger side. Which leaves us with 4 suspects: the right hand man of Administer Jang (Choi Song-woo), the right hand man of minister Shin (Kim Jin-woo), Shi-Yeol, and Yoo-ha.\n\nWe can immediately rule out Choi, as he was there apprehending Dan Oh. Kim Jin-woo and Shi-yeol has VERY distinctive inner eye brows, plus Shi-yeol's outer eyelids always droops very low, the most likely to be the OG Watchman is Yoo-ha. The distinctive 'triangle eyebrows' we see of the OG Watchman in eps2 5:20 is exhibited multiple times by Yoo-ha throughout the series, especially when he is looking ahead. The earliest one I can see is in eps1 19:24 in the Viki version, so I can say with great confidence that the watchman is Yoo-ha.\n\nOf course, narratively speaking, Shi-yeol being the OG Watchman would bring out the most drama, since the OG Watchman killed Hong-joo's fiance. But having watched Kang Hoon like a hawk in Little Women and now here (as both of his characters were my favourite in their respective shows), I just can't see the OG Watchman's eyes and eyebrows looking anything like Kang Hoon. Plus Shi-yeol as a character is clumsy AF pretty much all the time, which is not something you would see of a master swordsman.\n\nBut yeah, that's just meta talk, so if one is going by the plot, the story makes it a point that Yoo-ha splits off from the group before the 2nd watchman appears in eps 7, and that the story makes it a point that Queen Dowager was able to finance the watchman through her court maid in the same episode. Which makes it more likely Yoo-ha is the OG Watchman, as Yoo-has his adoptive mother die in eps 6 PRIOR to Dan Oh being kicked out, but was only was able to pay in eps 8 stating it was because of his inheritance.\n\nAs for why Shi-yeol was called 'highness' by the monk in a previous episode, or why Yoo-ha is considered in-line for the throne, there's no concrete evidence either way. Perhaps Shi-yeol is a bastard son of the current king or the deposed crown prince, or Yoo-ha has always been the stand-in for Yi Seul to keep him safe... who knows?",

Kang San is the Grand Prince, born to the queen, youngest brother of Yu-ha, I sometimes feel like Yu-ha is somewhat like a big brother to Kang San, he kinda expects explanations from Kang San's doing. I don't think Shi Yeol is the Watchman (but then again he could be, he has always been around Yu-ha and maybe act like he could be the CP to take attention off Yu-ha and the monk who saved him maybe part of the Watchmen), but then who is he? I had previously (before ep 7) thought that Yu-ha was the Watchman, and seems like he has the ability to as shown in ep 7, he looked like he was a better warrior than Kang San, who knows?!&lt; Anyway, I love this drama, only thing that makes Monday not so bad.",

I want to say he's &gt;!the Watchman, !&lt;but the elderly man on the street &gt;!who later helped save him with the Left State Minister called him \"Jeonha,\" which is what you call the king. No one else gets called Jeonha, only the king. Crown Price would be Jeoha or Seja; Grand prices are Daegun. So someone thinks Kim Shi Yeol is the real king. Could he be the son of the original king (Lee Seol's grandfather), making him Lee Seol's uncle? Or son of the grand prince? is Yoo Ha son of the crown prince too and therefore Lee Seol's brother? Or son of the grand prince and his cousin?!&lt; It's all so confusing. My hunch is that all 3 scholars are related,  but I can't forget that the man &gt;!who was clearly in league with the Left State minister !&lt;distinctly called Shi Yeol &gt;!Jeonha.  Which means someone thinks that he is the crown prince, even though he's too young to be San's father.!&lt; Wait, what if the Watchman/Watchmen are funded by the Queen Mother because &gt;!they are also her family?!&lt;",

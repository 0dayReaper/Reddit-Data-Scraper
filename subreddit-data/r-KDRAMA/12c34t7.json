            "comment": "**My Secret Terrius** (2018) (Thriller/Slice of Life/Action/Dramedy): Ex-spy on the lam ML ends up babysitting for neighbor FL's twin children after the untimely death of her husband, which involves them both in neighborhood and spy vs spy shenanigans. \n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The fashion. Apparently everyone in the intelligence community wears fabulous suits and has an obsession with designer handbags; very inconspicuous.\n* The found family. ML takes on both a fraternal and paternal role with FL's children, and him slowly opening up and remembering how to live a life on normal terms is incredibly heartwarming. Likewise, FL's friendships with her nosy but supportive neighbors and fellow parents are squad goals.\n* The parallel espionage plots. There are two spy agencies - NIS and KIS (the apartment's gossip mill/neighborhood watch) - that each deal with their own intrigues. When they cross purposes, it's a hilarious battle of wits as to who gets what information first.  \n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The romance. It doesn't really deserve the genre tag on MDL; it's entirely implied and not a major part of the plot. But it does have some great dynamics like a mutually protective FL and ML who just want to take care of each other and a 'notice me, noona/sunbae!' SML vying for the attention of SFL.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The inept spy-craft. You don't have to be an agent of international espionage to pick out some very obvious flaws, most of which could have easily been better dealt with by the story. \n* The tonal/narrative gulf. If it had committed to light-hearted parody with warm slice of life or serious espionage thriller with higher stakes it could have been a great drama, but skirting the line hurt both aspects of the story overall and the final 1/3 in particular.\n* The whack-a-mole antics. It's very obvious who the bad guy, which takes a lot of the thrill factor out of the spy side of things.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* There are a few famous scenes from international spy thrillers like *Kingsman*, *Leon: The Professional*, and James Bond re-framed on Kdrama terms.\n\nIt's a 7/10 as a whodunit spy thriller and a 8.5 as a cozy, domestic slice of life from me, so somewhere in the middle as a whole. If you're looking solely for a thriller, look elsewhere; but for the unique genre blend indicative of Kdramas it's definitely worth a watch.",

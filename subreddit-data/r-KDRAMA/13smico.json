Age and immaturity aside, as you said, at the time In Ho cheated with her, In Ho and Sung Hee weren't married. Nor did they have a kid. And she's paid the consequences. She became a pariah, she had to deal with an unplanned pregnancy in the middle of med school and eventually had to give up her career. Sung Hee's I was first agenda will have to come with it's own consequences if she's determined to have In Ho. As to why she would still want that when he's proven he has no spine, I really don't know. \n\nI'm a bit worried about who Dr Roy's family is because it's been a storyline that doesn't seem to have any clues at least for me, on where it's going.\n\nI really hope Jung Sook stays strong and pushes through with the divorce despite all of In Ho's manipulations. He really deserves to be left behind by all the women in his life. He's such a scumbag. \n\nGood on the two kids for fighting for their mom. After their neglect of her, they seem to have really turned around have started appreciating her and everything she's done for them more and more.",

It's too late dude, like Cha said. You should have treated her better all these years, not only now that you're losing her. I like that every time he tries something, she looks like she wants to just punch him in the face. Even if she did go back to him, he would just end up going back to how he was before once the \"threat\" is gone. \n\nTHAT was not how I expected Cha's mom to find out though! \n\nAlthough yes, In Ho is still very entertaining and hilarious to watch.

Which we do see as she confronts In-ho about how little he knew about his wife's illness in Episode 15, which (like the disability sticker) might be the final shoe that drops to convince her he is unworthy. \n\nThe show is setting everything up for Seung-hi and Eun Seo to leave for the US, Roy and CJS to get together and In-ho and his mum to end up with nothing. Though in true kdrama fashion, CJS will not take that building that belongs to her MIL and return it to mother and son, leaving them something to rebuild their lives with. \n\nI have to say the screenplay is just well written; the way Roy's confession unfolded over two flashbacks shows a much deeper love and affection he has for CJS and was totally unexpected.",

Didn't think so &lt;3\n\nI also love that finally there is some direct attack on Seo Inho from Jeongsuk's mom. I was all sorts of satisfied when she yelled \"Where are you Seo In Ho?\" in the restaurant. I was a little peeved that the focus was more on the two women and the daughters in earlier episodes instead of the fact that Inho was the root of the issues.\n\nAlso, I loved Jeongsuk and Roy's parts. It just shows to me the establishing of a good and reliable friendship before anything romantic. Thank you Jeongsuk, for cheering up Roy and not forcing him to say anything he didn't :'). And thank you, Roy, for saying that you'll keep your feelings at bay because you know now is not the right time! Love the meta self awareness.\n\nNext week is the last week already, but the pacing doesn't really show me how they are gonna wrap up loose ends... eg, In comes Jeongsuk's liver problem, the Divorce, Roy Kim, Jeongsuk's best friend,.. we'll see though lol",

He chose her out of all the people to accompany him to a very significant moment in his life. I think his very asking her to accompany him turned on a light bulb for her that he might really have feelings for her (because so far in every conversation with her girlfriend she says things like \"are you out of your mind?\" when the girlfriend hints that Doctor Roy is interested in her). Asking someone to accompany you to such a meeting means a lot: that you feel comfortable with them, to show yourself in moments of stress and vulnerability. And yes, there is something intimate about it in my eyes  (not necessarily romantic, but definitely a relationship that indicates great closeness)  \nAnd I was happy to see her go out of her way to encourage him after the blow he experienced (buying the shoes and running with him). He supported her from the first moment they met and it was nice to see that it was important for her to do the same for him (at first she hesitated and then suddenly there was such a moment before he ordered a taxi that she probably made a decision to do everything to make him happy).  \nIn addition, I realized that couple outfits are something common in Korea, so the matching shoes feel to me like a tantalizing hint of what will happen in the future (jump in time and see them in a relationship). One can only hope!",

I swear no matter what kind of script it is Kim Mi-kyung always aces her role. She was honest and straightforward with everyone. &gt;!Her letter to Seung-hee was heartfelt and a nice push for Seung-hee to finally see how badly her life has turned because of one man. It didn't felt like CJ'S mom forgave her but rather she hoped that such a talented and beautiful woman like her doesn't waste her remaining time with a man who has merely used her!&lt;. Imagine how Seung-hee's life would've been like if she had people who genuinely cared about her (though she still did terrible things to both CJS and her daughter by being with a man like In-ho and she should feel apologetic and this doesn't excuse her faults).\n\nJung-min and So-ra were so cute in today's ep. So-ra now no longer hides her very obvious feelings and now wears them on her chest like a proud badge. It's nice to see them openly conversing with each other. Jung-min may now finally find out what he wants to be as a doctor and be no longer in his father's shadow. Hwaiting Jung-min!\n\n&gt;!And now I can heave a sigh of relief that Roy is indeed not connected to any of our characters. Ngl I was getting worried that his story might go nowhere with the typical bs tropes kdrama writers usually conjure up. I was so angry when his \"family\" in the first conversation itself insulted his mother and then openly admited that they only wanted to meet him so that he can donate his bone marrow. Like how shameless can you can be?!!&lt; Thank god CJS was there to comfort him in her own ways. It's lovely to see how she can understand him without Roy saying a word and comfort him and he happily goes along with her. It was so sweet of him to ask her to come with him and say honestly that he was nervous and scared without feeling ashamed. In-ho could never. \n\nI'm a bit worried how they will work on the final week. I'm just hoping that we get an actual happy ending for CJS (hopefully with Dr Dream o'niel by her side) with all the loose threads somewhat tied (I've learned over the years not to keep high expectations with kdrama endings).\n\nAnd yeah. In-ho and his mother absolutely suck and I hope they both go through the twelve levels of hell. Seung-hee I know that you're delusional but please listen to people around you and especially your daughter. She has pretty much made clear that she wants absolutely nothing with her father (And I genuinely can't wrap my head around the fact that WHY are two talented and beautiful and capable ladies are fighting for a trash reincarnate like him).",

Each episode another character discovers the secret (they could have made some of the characters discover in the same episode).And the whole thing about her getting sick now really bugs me. The husband will donate his liver to her and then she will owe him forever? I don't like the direction of this. Even if she divorces him in the end.  \n\n\np.s  \nwhat's the deal with everyone listening in to other family members behind the door in this house?

Although the fight between the MIL and the scammers partner (were they married?) was really entertaining. But, I do think the divorce trial will be the next episode - especially with the preview including a voice talking about the division of assets. My guess is by the end of episode 15 the marriage will be legally over and Dr. Cha will be single. \n\nI also think that the Dr. Kim storyline about his DNA was &gt;! A feint on the part of the writers to get his profile in the system so he can donate part of his liver. This time In-ho will be ready to donate his liver but Dr. Cha won\u2019t take it or even need it.!&lt;\n\nI think Sueng Hi is finally beginning to see the light. I\u2019m happy to see she is a good doctor but the letter was an act of tough love that she really needed. She should prepare herself for a divorce trial - &gt;!At the minimum her affair with In-ho will be public but it\u2019s also likely to be revealed they had a child together. Sexism and ageism have had outsized roles in the story so I don\u2019t think it will go well for her career. Her daughters suggestion they move back to America will probably be a necessity rather than a choice by the end of the trial.!&lt;\n\nI don\u2019t particularly like Seung hi - she\u2019s cheated and is obsessed with becoming the wife she\u2019s always wanted to be. But I recognize In-ho is the worst person here. He was married, had more than ample opportunity to say no or (if he wanted to say yes to an affair that badly) be honest about the end of his relationship with Jung-sook. There were so many better ways to handle everything but every step of the way he decided not to even the smallest amount of honesty. In-ho is a reprehensible husband. He\u2019ll be miserable without Jung-sook and he knows it.\n\nI still  think Dr Cha and Roy Kim will end up together although I\u2019m seriously missing all the sweet moments of a romance. I agree time is running out for that. What I really miss is the character development that Dr. Roy deserved.",

To get to know herself separately from being a wife and a mom. I know that she'll stop being a wife and never stop being a mom, but I feel like she's lost herself in those roles and needs time to find who she is. I'd like to see her find an apartment that she likes, decorate it the way she likes, and learn to call it home. Do what she likes, like watch tv or eat when she likes. Create a schedule that revolves around her and no one else. Also, pick up a hobby or two separate from Roy, the hospital, and her kids.",

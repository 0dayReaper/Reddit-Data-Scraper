It's the first episode so everyone's motivations are still unclear.This is going to be one hell of a fun ride. The big bad seems very formidable as well so no one seems to be phoning it in.",

Love his antics during his thievery. He is very expressive despite the no-talking/full bodysuit.\n\nI'm interested why these Tongbo coins seem to matter so much. And why the criminal collector side all seem to know, while the official appraisers don't. Maybe they are part of a legendary crime/criminal? All the holes seem to suggest they were threaded or tacked on something, which is a bit weird as they are normally threaded through their actual  centre hole\n\n**Episode 2**\n\n- Very entertaining robbery with that duo\n- And the coins already have an explanation &gt;!hints for a lost treasure. Something that art criminals and historians know about. Still think it's a bit weird that the appraisers last episode seem to know zero about that. Although we don't know yet if the father is an ordinary historian or not!&lt;\n- I bet: Something bad happened to the father",

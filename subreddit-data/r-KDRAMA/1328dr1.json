She likely approached Dr Seo\u2019s/JS daughter with premeditated ulterior motivates and agenda, and purposefully dropped hints. If she knows the story, she might feel the way her mom does toward Jeongsuk- hating her for sleeping w her moms bf and getting pregnant w the son, and she likely hates her biodad for having cheated on his then gf (her mom) and then shamelessly continuing to have an affair w her mom secretly while getting married and continuing having his externally picture perfect family, his own kids completely unaware and enjoying their normal intact family. She probably just wants to blow it all open and make everyone as bitter and miserable as she\u2019s been all her life. What\u2019s interesting is her &gt;!budding bond w her mom, having surprisingly defended her mom in front of hater relatives. (The whole, \u201cI can bully and abuse my family member but no one else can.\u201d)!&lt; alls I know is there\u2019s a whole lot of narcissism, immaturity, and toxicity in these twisted triangles and squares. Minus Dr Roy Kim. He\u2019s an angel and should end up w Jeong suk after she dumps Dr Seo\u2019s ass. Dr Seo deserves to lose both women and families but honestly he and his mistress kind of deserve each other in their selfishness, narcissism, and twisted victim mentalities. I hope he gets fired, exposed, and ends up penniless and humiliated, but spends the rest of his life having serve and make it up to the women he wronged. Right now he\u2019s having his cake and eating it too, but he will have cake smashed in his face soon enough. Only a matter of time\u2026\n\nCan\u2019t wait for Dr Roy Kim &gt;!to confess his feelings to Jeong suk next episode (they totally Foreshadowed it!). Maybe he wants a chance to explore if she\u2019d reciprocate at least mentally and emotionally sharing attraction and affection, without wanting to be the whistleblower or the rebound. Then he\u2019d be friend zoned bc he\u2019d lose points as a romantic interest if he was petty and told her about the affair. That\u2019s gonna be down to the son and his gf who now knows, and them somehow helping mom come to the realization or encouraging her!&lt; to leave Dr Seo and be open to Dr Roy Kim\u2019s warm embrace \ud83d\ude05",

I know I'm probably the only one here who doesn't hate the mistress but I really think she was dealt bad cards. &gt;!She has a child from him!&lt;, &gt;!She got pregnant from him, wanted to give birth to the girl, her family alienated her (according to what her daughter said) she!&lt; has been in the shadow of his family for so many years. She is frustrated and in a bad place and when people are in those places they make bad choices. The husband is way bad than her imo. And I also wonder &gt;!if he is aware of the fact that her daughter is his. If he is aware and hasn't contacted the daughter all these years then he is just a terrible person.!&lt;\n\nOne more thing: It worries me a bit that relatively to episode 5 there is not much room for the romantic vibe between Doctor Cha and Doctor Roy. I really hope they will be a couple in the end..",

Because she dated this piece of trash first when they were teenagers? \n\nShe needs a therapist and self esteem, cause she absolutely has no sense or self-worth. And her behavior against the LEGAL WIFE, is embarrassing and appalling. \n\nSure, the FL took her boyfriend when they were teenagers and slept with her then boyfriend while she as abroad (she shouldn\u2019t have done that). But to be fair, they weren\u2019t married and were very young. It would be more of a big deal if they were engaged or married then, but no they weren\u2019t. \n\nThere is a difference between breaking up a family and home than your college boyfriend decided to sleep with some girl in your class while you were abroad (literally happened to half my friends in college - it sucked but they moved on and didn\u2019t become terrible mistresses with love children LOL).",

If Dr. Cha was unwilling to divorce, that would be that. However, once the affair is uncovered, Dr. Cha can divorce his ass in a hot minute because that's one of the reasons you can invoke for divorce.  It tickles me pink that she could keep the house too, since it's in her name.\n\nProfessor Seo absolutely would not want this because in Korea a divorce, especially for cheating, would absolutely kill his social standing.  He would be a pariah for a while, and the same for his mistress.\n\nWhat is getting interesting is that Doctor Cha is holding all the cards right now, her husband has been cheating for 20 years and the house was put under her name, but she doesn't know yet.  She is too nice to entirely take advantage of this, but  I foresee some scenes soon where both mother and son will be eating crow.",

He has obviously been preoccupied with this, debating if he should say something or not, then saw the words *just silence* and that clinched it. But that isn't consistent with the previews of next week's episode because we didn't see any fallout from something like that.  But then previews are often deceptive.\n\nAnother theory is that maybe he wants to confess to her, but that seems premature since she is still married and they just agreed to be friends two minutes ago.  But it would be consistent with the previews where someone says, why would he be interested in a mother of two?",

Cheating @sshole is probably feeling that things are getting out of control and that is why he reacted by trying to aggressively push Dr. Cha out of his ward and reacted so forcibly to discovering that his daughter doesn't want to go to med school.",

I really hope not because in my opinion this is a completely unnecessary plotline.  \n2. The young intern that the Dr Cha met in the cafeteria and she also had the same bracelet - is this a hint that the husband is also cheating on the mistress with a young intern? I really hope not because I don't have the strength to deal with him as it is.",

He was selfish when he was a student and remained selfish throughout.  He cheated on his girlfriend without thought, got another girl pregnant and was probably pressured into marrying her.  Resolved to have his cake and eat it too by maintaining both relationships; stringing his mistress along with the hope he one day leave his wife and concealing the affair from his wife. Used her to keep his social standing but treated her like an unpaid house slave.  Guilted her into quitting her medical career. The little flashes of concern I saw were bewildering and out of character.  They were black swans events as far as I am concerned.   All he cares about is himself and his standing.  Nothing else.\n\nAt first, I was hoping that Dr Cha gives him the boot so he can go and marry his mistress.  Now I am hoping that both women ditch his sorry ass, and for his wife to divorce him and continue to live in &gt;!the house that she actually owns!&lt;.",

He is losing his looks, his manhood and his ability as a surgeon.  Now on top of that, his rival, Dr. Roy, has discovered the affair, so that's hanging over his head.  So that is causing him to act out in anger and drive an even bigger wedge between himself and his family.  Before he was masking his desire for his wife to quit, behind some sort of concern for her and the family.  I think she still had some delusions that he cared for her at some level and was giving him the benefit of the doubt. Now the veil has been ripped and it's clear that there is more going on, and she will find out soon.  The blow-out will be spectacular.",

She's been a bit delusional up to this point, but there's no way someone who genuinely loves her kid could ever accept someone like him as a permanent fixture in their lives. She'll get that final clue she needs.\n\nBoth women are absolutely kicking his ass to the curb by the end. If he gets any sort of redemption, it may just be him realizing how awful he's been and starting down the road to make amends with all of his kids. But somehow I doubt that, and even if he does it won't be with anyone on his arm.\n\nThe one thing about this show that gets me is mis-prescribing a medication that could make a condition worse is kind of a big deal? Seems more serious than a patient wandering off, but that's the one that got Dr. Cha a disciplinary hearing. One is entirely in a doctor's control and one isn't (and if it was about her being a criminal, if it was that serious why was a guard not following them in the first place?)",

I much preferred episode 6. \n\nThe main issue for me now based on that cliffhanger is I really hope that FL doesn\u2019t find out about the affair from Dr. Dreamy. I don\u2019t know if I need to see a romance arc between them, but on the off chance it\u2019s going that way, I really don\u2019t want him to be the one to confirm the suspicions. (But then again if he doesn\u2019t and she found out he knew would that hinder any chances or break a friendship). \n\nI honestly can\u2019t stand the husband or the mistress, but I can\u2019t stand them SO much that I have to tip my hat to the actors and the writers - my dislike for them is so intense when they come on screen!",

The way he talked about his lost daughter (that he turned pale  when he found out about her) and his other children's is simply shocking.  \n2. What he did to his daughter - throwing away all her art stuff and tearing up her certificates is simply a violence move. There is no other way to describe it. Also the fact that he tried to use the medical hearing to get the hospital to fire his wife is just terrible.  \nIn short - a horrible man.  \n3. I still hope Dr. Roy doesn't tell Dr. Cha about the affair - hope she finds out on her own.  \n4. The running scene and the way they did slow motion on Dr. Roy made me believe that there was a chance for a romance between them (as well as Dr. Cha's dream)  \n5. I'm sure many will disagree with me here - but the relationship of the husband and the mistress feels much more real and authentic and full of depth to me than that of the husband and the legal wife. The fights, the reconciliation, the feelings are real. Hopefully in the end everyone will find their place in the world and the husband will atone for his actions in front of all three of his children but he and the mistress will be in a normal relationship at the end of the series. (I know I'm in the minority).\n\nAnd of course - a happy ending for Doctor Cha and Doctor Roy!",

I also hope he didn\u2019t rip all of the art she had for applications.. if so.. he is really ruining her life since she cannot make up that much art quickly. \n\nI think she already sort-of knows that he is cheating. She has been having the suspicion, started by the receipt (maybe started even earlier) then evidence has been piling up. \n\nThe bracelet on the woman\u2019s wrist\u2026 the fact the bracelet would be too early for her birthday gift?? How mistress and husband looked at each other (that time she got electrocuted).. the weird thing about the mistress\u2019 daughter.\n\nOverall, that last scene where all the evidence goes through her head leads to the idea he is cheating, even leading to the idea that he might have a third child with the mistress (although I didn\u2019t think that she\u2019s there yet and just finds it a weird coincidence?). \n\nI think I understand your point ab the relationship feeling real between them, I agree. Although I don\u2019t know how to feel about a possible ending for them. Should they be together? Would it be a slap in the face for others? Are the two women too good for him? I do feel bad for the mistress because of multiple things (her family abandoning her, raising a daughter alone, etc.).",

He's a good egg, that kid.\n\nThis show really knows how to finish an episode.\n\nETA. I think the cryptic comment at the end &gt;!\"You get involved in everything\" means that all sorts of obstacles are going to disappear, including harassment by a certain someone.  She has turned into their golden goose.  If I was her, I'd milk that to no end, but she isn't the type!&lt;\n\nAlso, I am tickled pink that it appears that the CEO's ingrateful son isn't going to end up with everything after all.  Ha! That serves him right.",

It's wierd. \n\nI don't think there was a progress in this episode, more like a filler episode with a definite revelation that the daughter of the mistress may be his daughter which means the young children are at the same age. I write may, cause it's a korean drama. \n\nI am starting to question korean dramas. Dramas are offcourse meant to be exaggerated but why do they cheat and become easily forgiven? Why should the women abused? Why should women forgive offensive and deeply disturbing behaviours from so many in the family?\nI am so offended as a human to see this used in so many dramas. It's a toxic display of family values.",

It's especially hard when the person doing that to you has control over you in the form of finances and the children. \n\nDr. Cha is beginning to stand up for herself but it seems extremely reductive to say it's a display of family values and is being easily forgiven. \n\nIn fact, the point of this show seems to be how NOT okay her situation is, to quote Roy Kim, \"When are you getting a divorce?\"",

    "postText": "P.S. You might find that Reddit [Enhancement Suit](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) helps you see [the pictures.](https://i.imgur.com/gT89aYV.png) \n\n\n----------------\n\nTo the [43 comrades](https://i.imgur.com/ZXCrX3z.png) from The Democratic Republic of Joseon, long live the solidarity of the revolutionary fighters of all the countries against the aggressiveness of the imperialist, anti-democratic and anti-communist forces! To the friends from Hell Joseon and other Hell countries, we salute you too! \n\nThank you all for answering [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKzT2RBuOIcdLbK5YyXdF40yiu_70PHAh3Golhg70IvBx0uw/viewform) survey. As promised in a small attack of conscientiousness, here are the [results:](https://i.imgur.com/qis7mCd.png)\n\nThis survey tells us that it is very important that the drama industry continues working, or 64% watchers will not be able to even breathe. I would have liked to say that all who answered the survey were humans, but in our sub there are also [43 creatures](https://i.imgur.com/cTFxwsJ.png) who are not sure of [who they](https://i.imgur.com/FWcsSYy.png) are, someone who is turning into a chicken nugget, a whale and a shoe. On the other hand, we have 35 very important and interesting creatures! There are actually so many people in top [professions](https://i.imgur.com/eJYZLXM.png) here:  30 plastic surgeons and 50 whale catchers! (The number of whale catchers shows that possibly some cats have answered the survey anyway, even though they were [explicitly forbidden](https://i.imgur.com/7z3ne0K.png) to do it.) \n\nUnfortunately, also 36 people [in prison.](https://i.imgur.com/faPuwp2.png) Maybe this sub should make some [special accommodation](https://imgur.com/vPR2Q2J) for prisoners? The 108 secretaries is a group I am sure can manage fine on [their own.](https://i.imgur.com/PNALVeE.png) Compared to the number of humans who answered (66), the number of prisoners are a bit high. Not sure what this means for the sub.\n\n24 people are not on [speaking terms](https://i.imgur.com/7AabSLo.png) with their children. For them, I suggest this sub: r/Plumbing . You don't need [an open well](https://i.imgur.com/cdcTasI.png) in this day and age! They could also join the 163 praying people, of course, and just pray for the well to get a lid on and/or for their children to [start speaking](https://i.imgur.com/ZzAgmKf.png) to them again.\n\nI hope this survey was to [great help](https://i.imgur.com/Vhwgy8r.png) in understanding our sub. If you want to read the full results, they are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pnN63WN2KUwuNQI6acwlDs129DBmjXuLH0yeW8EWkH4/edit?usp=sharing). The survey is still open to answers, but your [late answers](https://i.imgur.com/2C1NOEX.png) will not be counting for the [new policies](https://i.imgur.com/vebNwpx.png) to be implemented in this sub.\n\nOther notable answers: One person had affairs with three of his/her bosses. One person claims it is mandatory to watch ten hours a day. For owners of Korean phones and cars, but that is the whole world, no? One person has no soul. Is that one of the secretaries? While one person thinks that ONLY women shall speak on film, the majority finds the question annoying or thinks that it is not necessary.\n\nLastly, fifty people have not even seen **Heirs.** They are still welcome to this sub, but we expect that they will mend their ways.\n\n*All the screenshots except one are from **Heirs**. The exception is from **Alchemy of Souls**.*",

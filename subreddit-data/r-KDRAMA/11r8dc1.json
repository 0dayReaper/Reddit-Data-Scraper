I actually did recently watch OSN and liked it better the second time. Again I watched it because of JHI but I did appreciate how supportive the sisters and their mother were of each other. The youngest sister is the best! I really liked her character in SITR also. \n\nAre you referring to the jerky bf in OSN? I did appreciate how JHI didn\u2019t put up with the jerky bf.\n\nYou make a good point about how much more difficult SITR was emotionally. OSN was more tidy because the FL was much more assertive than the FL in SITR. Everyone was just stronger at dealing with difficult situations in OSN. \n\nI never saw Romance Is a Bonus Book but my friend liked it. I don\u2019t really like the ML so it turned me off from even starting to watch it. Hmmm. If it made you laugh so much, maybe I will check it out! \n\nI am watching Our Blooming Youth right now and I really like it. What are you watching these days?",

I watched it because of the ML also the girl from OSN was in it.  I actually like her better in the show.  I almost feel like someone writing this show without knowing where they were going and then switched midstream. At times I was ready to give it up! The ML is the only thing that kept me going. I ended up feeling very unsure about my feelings at the end.  I'm also in the middle of My Holo Love.  I don't really think I like it.  I keep trying to like it.  I'm going to try Our Blooming Youth.",

My first draft of a list had like 20 titles. But I narrowed it down to 7. I think this is a decent list with various genres. Plus they all are on Netflix so i didn't had to introduce a strange streaming site to them too. \n\n1) Crash Landing on You (\"realistic\" romance)\n2) Hotel Del Luna (fantasy romance)\n3) Move to Heaven (life drama)\n4) Vincenzo (Comedy action/crime)\n5) Arthdal Chronicles (Fantasy adventure)\n6) Flower Of Evil (romantic thriller)\n7) Welcome to Waikiki (Slice of life sitcom)",

Even without any words the song is a bop and a whole vibe. \n\nAlso, I wasn't expecting to not vote for any Psycho But It's Okay songs but ghost buster by gwangil Joe is a great song not just as an ost but in its own right. Shame that not many people have seen cafe minamdang though so I don't expect that to win.\n\nFrom this round I'm rooting for In Silence to win anyway",

I think most of the ones I like are going to be underrated though, I'm a musician and I think I look for something different in OST songs than most people seem to (more like uniqueness and it creating a 'different' mood than just being a 'nice song'). Even though I like a lot of kpop most of the songs by kpop artists don't do it for me as OST songs.",

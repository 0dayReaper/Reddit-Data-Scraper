To the uninitiated among us who haven't watched the seminal masterpiece, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs), she is r/KDRAMA's first lady, Kim Tan's main squeeze, Cha Eun Sang. She is a lady of [few words](https://i.redd.it/k3e6amnb9hg31.gif), but many, many tears.  \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted**.

The first half is exactly what I was expecting - heartwarming, funny, lots of training montages and a feel-good ending - except there\u2019s a whole other hour and that\u2019s when I was like \ud83e\udd2f- you would never ever expect a Disney teen bball streamer to go SO HARD. It really blew me away. I skimmed a positive review in the NYTimes so I should have guessed that this little movie would be good - but I was truly not prepared. The scenes with Chang and his mom - it was so real and raw, I held my breath\u2026All this to say, I loved it - check it out if you can",

The intricate family dynamics and complex relationships between the characters are portrayed so realistically, making it easy to empathize and draw parallels with my own family. It\u2019s a real testament to how those of us in our late 20s to early 30s sometimes relegate our families to the back burner as we strengthen friendships and start families of our own. The show's exploration of themes such as forgiveness, trust, and the importance of communication felt especially relevant and thought-provoking. It made me consider how many relationships I\u2019ve ended due to small misunderstandings snowballing into bigger problems.\n\nI'm also a sucker for cute, lovable characters, so I was glad to see Shin Jae-Ha in a non-villain role.\n\nFinal thoughts, I do wish they wrapped up the story a little earlier so we could have seen a little more of where everyone landed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it and feel like I could rewatch it later on.",

He felt bad that a shelter he followed for a while was planning to euthanize the dogs so he ended up adopting his current dog gomja. Once the news spread, every other animal was adopted soon before the deadline and thanks to his popularity, he singlehandedly managed to save all those precious good boys. \n\nHe chose his first drama **horse doctor** because it featured animals. \n\nHe even renovated his house to make it comfortable for his pets (dogs and cats). \n\nI love csw for his acting, and his love for animals made me fall harder &lt;3 \n\nSource: [namu wiki](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%A1%B0%EC%8A%B9%EC%9A%B0#s-9.1)\n\nExcited to read your unpopular opinions or favorite fun facts!",

            "comment": "i don't know if i would be able to list 10 but i'll try my best:\n\n1. my love from the star - the rewatch value for this is high for me. this was extended from i think it's original run of 20 episodes to 21 but it doesn't feel that way to me\n\n2. signal - this was so good i don't even know how to explain. it has the best \"crime\" on pilot episode in all of the thrillers i've watched (honorary mention: tunnel, if tunnel was aired not too close to signal i would've loved it more, but damn it, it aired almost at the same time as signal was so it was difficult not to compare)\n\n3. reply 1988 - i loved 1997 (haven't watched 1994) but the family values in here is topnotch. ensemble cast is on point.\n\n4. our blues - it's also an ensemble cast. this is like reply 1988 with a more character focused narrative each episode but i'd say this one explored a lot of sensitive topics in the guise of a slice of life/lighthearted series\n\n5. i hear your voice - i'd say this one is the one that would probably not aged as well as the other ones not due to the age gap per se but the age gap at which point in their lives they were. that being said, it's my guilty pleasure, so what can i do??\n\n6. weightlifting fairy - it's bonkers to me that this insanely popular drama has had mediocre ratings when it aired, but it has the fluff and the love\n\n7. our beloved summer - fluff romance in an adult setting? no love triange that panned out? no annoying side characters? SIGN ME UP!!!\n\n8. prison playbook - it was the more intense on this kind of genre given that this is on a prison set up. i still have a working theory that the producer and writer of this show regrets the end they chose for loonie (although it does make sense) that's why he's almost a recurring character to their other show giving him an alternate and better ending than what he got here. sorry for spoilers omg but it has to be said.\n\n9. hot stove league - baseball? me? could never. but how can they make me hook on a show that discusses trade and on a sport i don't care for???\n\n10. pinnocchio - this was the show that cemented my love for lee jong suk and of course my already love for park shin hye. this remains the series that has the first initial episodes for me. the sbs' famous flashback/setting up episodes during that year.\n\n11. the glory - i know it's supposed to be top 10 but whatever, this is the revenge drama that i hated watching because now i can't watch any revenge dramas without thinking what revenge drama is THAT bitch\n\nhonorable mention: doctors (one must get past the age gap thingy similar to i hear your voice), cheese in the trap (i'm sorry this is also a guilty pleasure of mine), voice (i hate to even say this but it was only actually THAT good in season 1)",

I assumed I would hate it - instead I got one of the best-written shows I've ever seen and loved it. One of my biggest surprises in kdrama, that show was. I was certain I'd hate it. \n\n\n\nI did the same with **Navillera**. Chose it specifically because it looked like something I wouldn't normally watch - ended up being one of my highest-rated shows ever. If anyone ever wants to lose weight quickly, just watch this show and you'll lose about 20kg in a few hours just through crying. Boxers use this show before weigh-ins.",

I loved this show so much that I wrote a review on it lol. \n\nMy Liberation Notes: I won\u2019t call it a coming of age drama, more like a coming into adulthood drama. Breaking out of one\u2019s shell and limiting beliefs , coming out of a dark place, and finding sunshine in the end. Slice of lifey in a way. \n\nMoonshine: cool saeguk drama, that had humor, plotting and romance\n\nVincenzo\n\nSecret Royal inspector and Joy: serious and lighthearted at the same time. Loved joy\u2019s attitude to life, her room and how she decorated it. \n\nLove and Leashes (movie): loved the funny spin on bdsm",

            "comment": "The Top Nine dramas I've watched in the last 6 months or so (just because I don't have ten):\n\n1. Shadow Detective - the story of a basically decent guy who has tried to do the right thing but has cut some corners, and the impact of his choices on his life. Lee Sung Min is outstanding as the lead. This one is in my top ten of all time list. \n2. Agency - the best workplace drama and the best drama about women as they navigate the dilemmas of modern life that I've ever watched. Lee Bo Young leads a stellar cast. This one also goes in my top ten of all time. \n3. The Greatest Love - funny, sweet, timely even though it was made in 2011. Gong Hyo Jin shines. Ding dong!\n4. Do You Like Brahms? - this is a sweet and gentle love story. People in their twenties looking to navigate that life stage as you leave school and start to figure out what your life is going to look like. Made me smile.\n5. May It Please The Court - this one starts out unremarkable but gets better and better as it goes along. Highly recommended, especially if you are liking My Perfect Stranger.\n6. Payback: Money and Power - this one is just a fun and wild ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Golden voiced Lee Sun Kyun plays the Everyman who takes on the forces of evil. Hold on to your hat!\n7. Call It Love - I'm taking this one slow, but enjoying the evocative mood\n8. Birthcare Center - this one is so moving in so many ways. A wonderful story about women's friendships, motherhood, and how to cope when you can't \"have it all\", or even, in some cases, have what you most wish for. And if dreamy guys who adore you and support you through thick and thin is your thing, then this drama is for you! No villains. Just overcoming difficult life circumstances and good communication. \n9. My Perfect Stranger - this one drew me in with the story, and now the characters are starting to develop as well. (I thought they were kind of wooden at first.) Such a wonderful exploration of how context changes everything. And a good mystery, too.",

One of the very few dramas I\u2019ve seen where I\u2019ve laughed and cried. \n\n2. **Snowdrop** - this drama doesn\u2019t get the love it deserves and is rarely mentioned. I love a good government conspiracy and hostage story. The chemistry between Hae In and Jisoo was incredible. \n\n3. **Twenty-Five Twenty-One** - you all already know. \n\n4. **Reborn Rich** - watched this live with you all as it was airing. I loved the suspense each week. The plot was creative and unique. \n\n5. **Big Mouth** - I binged this in a weekend. Lee Jong Suk was made for that role \n\n6. **Happiness** - I loved the two leads together. They had so much chemistry despite this not being a romance. \n\n7. **All of Us are Dead** - I really enjoyed the friendship in this drama. That campfire scene was the cutest. Excited for season 2! \n\n8. **Our Blues** - I loved how there were so many different stories and each one was interesting. This was brilliantly filmed. \n\n9. **My Name** - this kept me off the edge of my seat. Loved Han So Hee in this role more than her typical roles\n\n10. **The Good Bad Mother** - One episode left as I am writing this, but I\u2019ve loved this show so much. The acting has been so good.",

Hahaha\n\n1. **Goblin** \\- it's got a bit of everything: romance, comedy, fantasy, horror, and not to mention the amazing chemistry and bromance! I just loved the tragic backstory, the plot progression, and everything in between. Cinematography and OST are definitely great too. I know it's not perfect, but it really resonated with me. \n2. **Reply 1988** \\- beautiful portrayal of familial relations, friendships across all ages, and youth. \n3. **2521** \\- I just found everything about this beautiful. From the FL's fencing journey, her growth, their friendships (definitely squad goals!), the simplicity of their teen lives, and the blooming romance between the two leads. \n4. **Alchemy of Souls** \\- I don't think I even need to defend this one hahahhaa\n5. **Mr. Sunshine -** I found the historical aspect just so interesting and captivating, and that it blended so well with the own characters' stories, especially the FL's of course. Cinematography is given! \n\nOthers I couldn't decide to be in the top 10 lol: Mr. Queen, Flower of Evil, HP, The Devil Judge, When the Camellia Blooms, Sweet Home, Vincenzo, Tale of the Nine-Tailed, Moon Lovers",

            "comment": "My favorite tropes are contract relationship and forced cohab, which is obvious from a review of my faves. Anything in my top ten must have high value to rewatch; The Glory is excellent but not on my top ten because I don\u2019t think I could watch it again. Romantic drama or comedy is my favorite genre but not a requirement for my top ten. \n\n**Business Proposal** Great chemistry, love when arrogant ML get schooled by the FL. Fun story, great pacing, second couple almost more interesting than main couple, characters experience emotional growth. \n\n**Love To Hate You** Strong and unconventional FL, eventually sweet ML, FL is dominant, good pacing, enjoyed FL\u2019s fight scenes, characters experience at least a little emotional growth, my favorite kdrama sex/bedroom scene. \n\n**Dali and the Cocky Prince** Visually interesting in particular with styling of FL and ML, love slightly stupid or ignorant MLs who are obviously and enthusiastically supportive of FL, FL gets knocked around but makes good choices and isn\u2019t wishy-washy, all-around good drama with sweet love story. \n\n**Uncanny Counter** All-around great cast and acting, fun story, love the family-like relationships between the counters, lots of good comic moments, like the supernatural elements of the story. Also loved the matching track suits. \n\n**My Liberation Notes** Slow pace while maintaining tension which is hard to do but soooo good. Loved the story, the acting, and how the stories of all the characters ended. Really thought provoking. \n\n**When the Camellia Blooms** wonderful story arc and development of characters, excellent child actor, love slightly stupid or ignorant ML with bold personality who are obviously supportive of FL, great cast of side characters and interesting marketplace slice of life. Even the serial killer story arc works well within the context of the story. Strong FLs are my favorite but also enjoy a FL who becomes strong over the course of the drama. \n\n**Something About 1 Percent** My favorite: contract relationship. Nice change of pace that chaebol chairman is sweet and selects low income FL to date his grandson because of her personal merits. Independent FL; arrogant ML gets schooled by FL; romance develops slowly but is strong and compelling when it does. \n\n**Love In Contract** Absolutely loved Go Kyung Po\u2019s nuanced performance and loved the ML; I have a special affinity for MLs who seem slightly spectrum. Fun premise with unconventional FL. Loved the Easter egg with Kim Jae Young recreating one of his scenes from *100 Days My Prince.* There is some uneven points in the story but overall was a lot of fun to watch. My top 10 list wouldn\u2019t be complete without at least one Park Min Young drama. \n\n**The Heirs** Must have one Lee Min Ho drama on my top ten, and must celebrate wonderful tropes. Kim Tan\u2019s hairstyle and sweaters deserve billing as characters on their own. Great cast and acting, story is told well and compelling. \n\n**100 Days My Prince** Again my favorite forced relationship trope, sageuk version. Good acting and sets, costumes; excellent strong FL, love ignorant or slightly stupid MLs (amnesia counts), wonderful development of the romance, really liked the SML. \n\n**Honorable Mention:** Forest, Dinner Mate, The Great Show, Queen In Hyun\u2019s Man, Secret Garden, Reborn Rich. EDIT: add Because This Is My First Life.",

No noble idiocy here.  My favourite line &gt;!Don't take him away from me and don't take me away from him.  It was refreshing to see a character recognize how important they are to someone and recognizing how deeply hurt the other person would be if they were separated. She understood how much he loved her.  So often in dramas, especially with the noble idiocy, it's as if the other person's feelings don't matter and the assumption is they will get over it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;love ignorant or slightly stupid MLs (amnesia counts)\n\nTwo K-dramas are good examples.  I hear your voice and Shopping King Louis.  There is something about amnesia that makes the ML so vulnerable and it brings out all the mothering instinct in the FL.  Love it.",

You can only describe him as a lost puppy that followed you home.  His amnesia makes him so vulnerable, he makes you *feel* it.  Being lost and alone.  Both leads are so endearing.  It's a flip on the theme of the strong protective man taking a woman under his protection.\n\nI will usually rate any drama that has the noble idiocy trope down a few points.  I wish the trope would die.  It's so damaging, as you say.\n\nI Hear Your Voice was interesting because he gets &gt;!amnesia at some point and the contrast between his earlier self and amnesiac self was really interesting.!&lt;  Again, it's that vulnerability thing.",

Some of the lines are like poetry and the music is beautiful too.\n\n2. Extraordinary Attorney Woo. The first Kdrama I ever watched. I loved watching Woo Young Woo, a lawyer on the autistic spectrum, work hard to make a place for herself and Park Eun Bin was amazing in the role. The romance was also sweet. \n\n3. Crash Landing on You. The Kdrama that made me realize I needed more Kdrama. Romance, humor, action, fun side characters. I literally cried at this one.\n\n4. Because This Is My First Life. I love fake marriage plots and this one did it right. Side couples also fantastic. This show also had things to say about gender politics and the compromises we make in life.\n\n5. Touch Your Heart. Lovely, funny romantic comedy featuring two of the actors from Goblin (though I actually watched this one first.) \n\n6. Tomorrow. Story of \u201cgrim reapers\u201d trying to prevent suicide. The stories were so moving to me that I cried more than once. Nice special effects also.\n\n7. Move to Heaven: Story of a team lead by a young autistic man that cleans the dwellings of people who have died. Addresses issues such as adoption and gay issues with sensitivity and the stories of the cleaners themselves are also touching.\n\n8. One Day Off: A new favorite of mine, it\u2019s a short drama about a teacher who likes to escape on day trips. But it\u2019s more than a travelogue - it\u2019s a series of beautifully shot and subtly acted stories about human connection.",

            "comment": "I am someone who watches KDramas to chill out, and I prefer fluffy romcoms without a whole lot of angst. My top 10, without any particular order, would be\n\n1. **Goblin** - It's a great spectacle in itself. It has all the factors a blockbuster needs. 2 great leads, 2 cute second leads, beautiful sets, and great music. The story and script are a bit on the predictable side, but it's still enjoyable. The chemistry between the 2 leads is just amazing.\n\n2. **What's Wrong with Secretary Kim** - A very cliche drama with the arrogant-boss-falls-for-employee trope, but this one is so cute. There are plenty of other cliche setting, too,  like the &gt;!past/childhood relationships!&lt; but they handle it well.\n\n3. **Our Beloved Summer** - A simple adult love story about two young adults. There is no annoying second love interest. Although the cause for the initial breakup is a bit annoying, the rest of the show is gold. The two leads have great chemistry and handle the love and humor very well.\n\n4. **Crazy Love** - This one was a revelation for me. It was an underrated drama that I found after someone from this sub recommended it. Again, the arrogant-boss-and-employee lovestory, with added enemies-to-lovers tropes, but the physical humor was just on point. Both Kim Jaewook and Crystal Jung leave you laughing to the point of tears.\n\n5. **Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bokjoo** - Perhaps the best collegelife romance I've watched. It deals with past trauma and body image issues very well, and the romance part is so cute and funny.\n\n6. **Business Proposal** - Another arrogant-boss-and-employee trope but with added misunderstandings. It's one of the most rewatchable dramas ever. It's light, funny and very sweet. Plus, both the leads are serious eyecandy.\n\n7. **Itaewon Class** - A drama without romance as its main plot. The whole storyline is amazing, and the characters are even better. Yoo Jaemyung is one the greatest on-screen villains in a KDrama ever. The growth of different characters and the plot-progression is awesome.\n\n8. **Beauty Inside** - Just the natural progression of love between the leads and their chemistry makes it a must watch. Both of the leads have problems of their own, and the way they support each other through them is amazing.\n\n9. **Strong Girl Do Bongsoon** - One of the funniest KDramas I've ever watched. The female lead is one of my favorite characters ever in a KDrama. It's a complete package with action, romance, and comedy with some superpowers thrown in.\n\n10. **Vincenzo** - A surprisingly good watch, considering how weak the overall story is. The mystery about the main villain is a plus, but the main driving force for the drama is the badass MC.\n\nA few honorable mentions.\n\n**2521** - The first 14 episodes are the best I've ever seen. It's perfect. But the other two ruined the whole fun for me. I understand why they ended it that way, considering it's more of a coming-of-age story rather than romance, but I feel we, as an audience, deserved a better ending.\n\n**Hotel Del Luna** - It had amazing music, and the FL is so cute, but the overall story is a bit weak. \n\n**She Will Never Know** - Another cute office romance with very likable ML and FL. But I found the whole thing a bit too shallow. I would have preferred a little more development of the characters.\n\n**Shooting Stars** - If it had a better ML, this would have been perfect. The addition of a completely unnecessary villain also ruins a bit of the story.\n\n**20th Century Boy and Girl** - I never understood why nobody mentions this one. It's a sweet romcom with childhood sweethearts finding each other again, and it's cute and funny too. But I've never seen anyone talking about it on this sub.",

            "comment": "My watchlist has 230+ kdramas and other asian Media, it's safe to say i will not run out of things to watch for a WHILE.\n\nI have completed  31 Kdramas so far, my top 20 is:\n\n\n1. Beyond Evil: my second kdrama, i still hyperfixate on this weekly. I love everything about this.\n\n\n\n2. Nobody Knows: The character dynamics are out of this world, i love these characters so much, the mystery plot isn't ground breaking but the characters make this one of the best i've watched\n\n\n\n3. Blind: this show really had me on the edge of my seat, i hope they make more kdramas like this in the future! The welfare home in the drama is also based on the Brother's home tragedy (the rest is obviously fiction) which makes it all more chilling what happend to the characters.\n\n\n\n4. Mouse: this drama is so awesome, i was hooked by the second episode. This has one of my favorite episode in all the kdramas i've watched, i was gasping a lot xD There was one thing i really hated though, if that one scene wasn't there this would probably be my favorite show.\n\n\n\n5. Psychopath Diary: i have never laughed so much in my life.\n\n\n\n6. Extracurricular: most stressfull show i've ever watched. The characters are really going through it. I love angsty stuff. We won't get a season 2 but i'm honestly fine with it.\n\n\n\n7. All of Us Are Dead: I always thought i didn't like Zombie media, but this changed by mind. I had so much fun binging this. I hope season 2 is just as good, i wonder how they are going to write the story as they already adapted the webtoon fully.\n\n\n\n8. Happiness: i love the main couple so much! Best friends to lovers ever! But i was sad that my favorite character died, they didn't deserve this...\n\n\n\n9. Big Mouth: the first half was literally so fucking amazing, the second half was less amazing, but still good in my opinion. I love it when underdog characters accidentally become respected or feared.\n\n\n\n10. Strangers from Hell: my first kdrama. Still has a place in my heart, i hope they adapt the writers other webtoons as well (because i can't find good translations..)\n\n\n\n11. Bad and Crazy: my third kdrama, a love the mix of action, comedy and thriller a lot! Also, the bromance is so good.\n\n\n\n12. Move to Heaven: i cried like every episode. \n\n\n\n13. Squid Game: deserved the hype, i hope season 2 doesn't mess this up, they left a lot open in the first season\n\n\n\n14. The King of Pigs: i was positevly suprised that the gore wasn't even censored (the blurry knives and bodies really take me out of a story when watching thrillers...) such a great ending! I do wish the FL was more of a character.. she was basically just a plot device.\n\n\n\n15. Extraordinary Attorney Woo: Young Woo is so relatable to me it's not even funny anymore. There where some issues with this show, especially in the autism portrail (she is a savant, which like only 70ish people in the world have, so not very common autism type) but it was still a huge step in the right direction. I hope they get an actual autistic person as a writer/helper in season 2 in order to fix the issues the first season had. I also want Young Woo's brother as a main character (the actor played a main character in the King of Pigs, he is born in 2008 and has so much talent already!)\n\n\n\n16. Stranger: This was so good! But i do wish they would have explained/explored Shi Mok and his disabilty more, given that it's written in the description i was hoping it would be an important part of his character (which it kinda was, just not as much as i was hoping) I can't wait more the spin-off (aka season 3)\n\n\n\n17. Through the Darkness: I love the character so much. Ha Young is one of the most interesting ML's i have ever seen. I love how empathic he is!\n\n\n\n18. Train: such an interesting concept! I thought this was amazing, would watch many seasons of this. I didn't mind that the fantasy/sci-fi part was never explained as it spawns a lot of amazing theories. I also heard they are making a british remake?! Uh oh. \n\n\n\n19. Signal: this one is a classic, i want my season 2!!\n\n\n\n20. My Name: i think i liked this less than many, but it was still good!",

Usually, that will last an episode or two.  I don't like that part.  I feel on edge, and have the urge to fast-forward to get through it. (I don't though, I almost never fast forward).  If it lasts too long, I start yelling at the screen.\n\nIn this particular drama, it was one conflict after another so I feel like for most of the second half I was on edge.",

Great storyline perfectly executed, with an amazing cast, awesome soundtracks and ofc the bromance.\n* **Pinocchio**: My very first K-drama, the one in which I fell in love with LJS. Two young reporters and a tragic past. I watch it everytime I'm in a slump and I never get tired of it.\n* **Vincenzo**: Though the hot and handsome Italian Mafia Consilierge is one reason to watch this drama, I'd say watch it for the crazy (but fun) Geumga Clan or the handsome psycho villain or maybe just to hear cute Italian curses? lol\n* **Mr.Queen**: Modern historic fusion drama. A present day chef wakes up in the body of Joseon Queen - do I need to say more?\n* **Happiness**: Park Hyung Sik and Han Hyo Jo did a great job in this great job in this drama that they made it to my top power couple. Strange virus that make people go crazy and bite other people. My power couple are trapped in their apartment trying to save themselves and the other residents.\n* **Bad and Crazy**: Ahhhh, my love for Wi Ha Jun stemmed from this drama. Crime, action thriller and a crazy mysterious self proclaimed hero named 'K'\n* **Tomorrow**: A different take on the concept of grim reapers - crisis management team consisting of 2 grim reaper and a half dead human. These grim reapers save people instead of taking their soul away. I love this drama soo much!\n* **My Name**: A great revenge thriller that had me on edge. Defenitely didn't see that twist coming.\n* **W: Two Worlds**: A webtoon character and a human girl fantasy romance. \\*sigh\\* These kinda things never happen in my life.\n* **The Heirs**: Typical Rich boy x poor girl romance. Lemme warn ya : this drama is very cheesy and cliched, lot of complicated relations, and has that meany girl and bad boy bully. But somehow, I keep rewatching this drama.\n\nSome other dramas I love include **Strangers From Hell** (horror crime that kinda kept me up at night), **18 Again** (sweet family romance I couldn't get over), **Semantic Error** ( A cute BL), **The Silent Sea** (A sci-fi thriller but I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea), **Extracurricular** (God this drama stressed me out so much!)",

            "comment": "These are the top 10 KDramas that come to my mind currently, they are not in any specific order:\n\n1. [Again my Life (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/692043-again-my-life)**:** Based on a Webtoon of the same name, starring Lee Joon Gi, Kim Ji Eun, Cha Joo Young and Lee Kyung Young is an *action packed fantasy drama* based on a prosecutor who gets killed while investigating a high ranked politician but gets a second chance at living his life to make things right. He encounters various people along his journey who end up becoming his allies in his fight. While the webtoon has a closed ending, the drama pushes the scope for a season 2. One of those dramas where I enjoyed the OSTs, Lee Joon Gi's action sequences (which are always a banger), the plot felt pretty new and the casting, almost perfect. Maybe the ending feels a little rushed and bit unsatisfactor but overall, it's a good drama to binge.\n2. [Bo Ra! Deborah (14/14)](https://mydramalist.com/725573-i-m-serious-about-dating): Yoo In Na makes a spectacular comeback in this series starring  alongside Yoon Hyun Min, Hwang Chan Sung, Park So Jin. It's a *Rom-Com drama* which follows the story of Deborah who's widely known for being a successful author of romance novels and dating coach. She suffers setback in her own life and encounters Lee So Hyuk who works in a publishing company but is afraid and unclear about confessing his feelings. I couldn't stop laughing with this one, many of the scenes were well played out and felt super realistic and relatable. The show was a treat from the start to the very end. I don't think I'm gonna say more about this, you just need to see it for yourself.\n3. [Beyond Evil (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/60911-monster): If you were to ask me for a *psychological thriller crime series*, this would be the top recommendation in my list. The plot, the casting, the OST, the suspense, everything was TOP NOTCH. Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo, the back and forth between these two and their acting, it just doesn't get any better. The story is set in a quiet city where they work together to solve the mystery behind the gruesome killings that took place years ago only to find that the truth goes much deeper than it seems. Can recommend Watcher, Signal and Through the Darkness if you like shows like these.\n4. [The Devil Judge (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/62087-the-demon-judge): Open the floodlights because Ji Sun apprising his role as Kang Yohan is here! I'd never seen this guy before but he knows how to make an entrance, he literally made the whole show, he was the HYPE. By the end of the show, I was a fan. The OSTs and the visuals were just picture perfect for this *legal and mystery drama*, I could never skip the intro lol. It has a bit of everything, action, suspense, thriller, mystery. The story is set in a dystopian Korean where Kang Yo Han leads the courtroom as a strong authoritarian presiding judge, he takes down corrupt leaders, and officials, punishing them whilst his own mysterious past continues to haunt him. Saw a lot of fresh actors in the series and they played out their roles pretty well, some of the noticeable ones being Park Jin Young, Kim Min Jung, Baek Hyun Jin, Ahn Nae Sang and Park Gyu Young.",

                    "comment": "5. [Stranger (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/21934-stranger): God! Hwang Si Mok played by Cho Seung Woo! (absolutely Chef's kiss!) Stranger S1-S2 is a Crime Drama Thriller series which will grapple your attention with the intense plot from start to finish. It mainly focuses on how Hwang Si Mok a prosecutor known for having a stone cold attitude teams up with Han Yeo Jin played by Bae Doo Na, a police lieutenant to solve a serial murder case while also diving deep to root out the corruption in police and prosecution who keep fighting each other over control of power in investigations. The first season and the sequel, both are entertaining to watch. Although you will be asking for more by the time you finish the whole thing! I became a fan of Cho Seung Woo and Bae Doo Na, the subtle but beautiful camaraderie between these two &lt;3. It led me on to watch [Divorce Lawyer Shin](https://mydramalist.com/720931-sacred-divorce) starring Cho Seung Woo and it did not disappoint, the guy's range, it's really amazing to see. Lee Joon Hyuk playing the role of a prosecutor that keeps sliding between both the sides while Yoo Jae Myung and Shin Hye Sun play major roles in S1.\n\n  \n6. [Soundtrack #1 (4/4)](https://mydramalist.com/713865-why-did-you-come-to-my-house): Soundtrack is a short musical romance Korean drama based on unrequited love that focuses on the story between two friends. Park Hyung Sik plays the role of Han Sun Woo, a rookie photographer and Han So Hee plays the role of Lee Eun Soo, an aspiring lyricist who finds it hard to write songs based on love and romance, having never experienced such feelings herself and so she seeks out help from her close friend. It's a short sweet drama and you'll wish there was more to watch when you see the chemistry between these two. Nevertheless the OSTs, the visuals and sceneries are a treat to watch and it's a nice drama to binge while probably having dinner.   \n\n\n7. [Hot Stove League (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/39221-stove-league): I'll be honest, I came here after watching Min Namkoong in [One Dollar Lawyer](https://mydramalist.com/715969-one-thousand-dollar-lawyer) (it was a hilarious show, unfortunately cut down to only 12 episodes) expecting to see him in action once again and he didn't disappoint. HSL is a sports based korean drama where Baek Seung Soo is appointed as the new general manager of Dreams - a major league baseball team, labelled losers after having performed badly in consecutive seasons. He has take on various challenges after he gets pressured by the owners to conform with their decisions whilst trying his best to prepare a new team that can turn the tables around for them. Includes some notable actors namely Park Eun Bin, Oh Jung Se and Son Jong Hak who have main roles in the show. If you've watched the movie Moneyball starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, you'll probably end up watching this whole drama too. I enjoyed it thoroughly though best be warned, there's not any romance or action here. But if you like watching Min Namkoong, this is a must watch. He delivers!\n\n  \n8. [Our Beloved Summer (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/694231-us-that-year): God! I think this has been on everyone's watchlist. The OSTs and the way they are timed throughout the show, the visuals, the Choi Woo Shik (watching him after [Ho Goo's Love](https://mydramalist.com/12380-ho-goos-love) felt like he hasn't changed a bit) and Kim Da Mi absolutely killed it with their roles. OBS is a rom com drama inspired by a webtoon of the same name. It starts off as fun and sweet, the rivalry between the two ex lovers who once starred in a documentary, fighting each other seems hilarious, but then you get to dive deep into the story behind their lives and their characters, be it Kim Seung Cheol's role as Kim Ji Woong or Roh Jeong Eui who portrays NJ, or the story of Choi Woong's parents, everyone's background and plot is set perfectly to blend in with the story and it's an amazing warm experience that will have you laughs and tears. This is a must watch. If you want to experience a KDrama, this is it!\n\n  \n9. [Run On (16/16)](https://mydramalist.com/58651-run-on): Starring Im Si Wan, Shin Se Kyung, Choi Soo Young and Kang Tae Oh, Run On is a romance-sports-life slow paced drama that revolves around Ki Sun Gyeom who is a national sprinter but has to quit because of an incident with his fellow trainees and Oh Mi Joo who translates subtitles for movies. This drama was a fresh breath of air and something different for me. The story doesn't have the usual drama cliches or tropes that you'd expect to see but comes off as rather realistic and relatable. The interaction between the characters feel real and more human. Became a fan of Im Si Wan and that led me to [Summer Strike](https://mydramalist.com/703721-i-don-t-want-to-do-anything) which came off to be another really good Kdrama. This drama might not be for everyone, as it doesn't have that exciting appeal to it or that level of drama or romance that keeps you hooked but if don't expect something extraordinary or fast paced, you might just enjoy this.\n\n  \n10. [Weak Hero Class 1 (8/8)](https://mydramalist.com/702267-weak-hero): This is a powerful action thriller drama based on the webtoon with the same name. Park Si Eun is a model student who appears weak but is able to fight off against the bullies in school with his wits and quick thinking. He befriends two others, Ahn Soo Ho and Oh Beom Seok from his class and they hang out together. Soon, however things start changing in their friendship dynamics after a girl Young Yi joins them and the story starts getting pretty wild from their onwards. The acting demonstrated by the cast in the show is beyond words, Park Ji Hoon, Choi Hyun Wook and Hong Kyung are a class apart with their acting skills. Just amazing really. I didn't have much expectations but was damn well impressed after finishing the drama. The webtoon is currently ongoing and the post credits scene does indicate the scope for a Season 2 in the future. Ep 8 was just, god, a great finale! Watch the show and maybe you'll see for yourself what the hype is about.",

OBS had this at times melancholy, dreamy feel that I loved. If you haven\u2019t seen it, At a Distance, Spring is Green with Park Ji Hoon had a similar vibe. I think it pairs really well with Weak Hero because you can compare the way his characters in both dramas have difficulty forming relationships with others.",

I barely slept the days that I watched that drama for the first time, because every cliffhanger had me wanting to click \"next episode\".  I've watched this drama probably more than ten times now.  It introduced me to the illegally beautiful Lee Jong Suk.\n2. **The Guest**.  My favorite thriller/horror drama.  While I think the ending was a bit disappointing, I loved every twist and turn leading up to the finale.  The acting was phenomenal, and the cinematography and music was \ud83d\udc4c.\n3. **Hyena**.  I think the only reason this drama didn't win the award for Best Drama is because it came out the same year as Hot Stove League.  The chemistry between Ju Ji Hoon and Kim Hye Soo in this drama was *fire \ud83d\udd25*.\n4. **Kairos**.  I've seen my share of time travel/time bending dramas (such as Signal, Circle, Tunnel), and this one is my current favorite.  Shin Sung Rok really gets to shine as the male lead in this drama, one of the few times he's actually the lead, and the writing is excellent IMO.\n5. **Pinocchio**.  This is one of those dramas that just seems to get better every time I watch it.  It's hard for me to articulate all the reasons why I like it.\n6. **Shopping King Louis**.  This is one of the few chaebol dramas I've watched that I actually like.  Louis and Bok Shil's innocent naivet\u00e9 and optimism as they struggle with day to day living is refreshing to watch.\n7. **Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo**.  This is the one that started it all for me, so of course it's in my top 10 list, every time.  This drama charmed me and sucked me into the wonderful world of Kdrama.\n8. **Suspicious Partner**.  My first Ji Chang Wook drama, and also technically my first legal drama.  \n9. **Kill Me, Heal Me**.  Ji Sung.  Need I say more?  (I guess other people might say Park Seo Joon, but for me it was 100% Ji Sung).\n10. **Can You Hear My Heart**.  This drama won me over, despite its slow start.  I honestly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.  I've watched several of Namgoong Min's dramas, and this one and Chief Kim are my top favorites.",

Introduced me to Lee Dohyun, too.\n\n3. **Beyond Evil** - eternal screaming\n\n4. **True Beauty**\n\n5. **Semantic Error**\n\n6. **The Devil Judge** - just watched it over the last week, so this may move 1 or 2 spots higher/lower depending on how I feel about it as time goes on but it was a great watch.\n\n7. **Strangers From Hell** - made me realize that I was really into this psychological thriller/horror genre\n\n8. **Blueming**\n\nHonourable mentions of the lesbians and sapphics: The Handmaiden (movie so it's not on the list but it'd be at #9), Lily Fever (forever salty there was no season 2), Graduation, Present + Propose (so short but so cute). The latter 2 are too short to have made as much of an impact on me and I'm forever hoping we get long-form lesbian content, please \n\nSome other honorable mentions that stick with me: Light On Me, Where Your Eyes Linger, Midnight (movie).\n\nMy favourites are clearly just: queer romance shows and low-romance psychological thrillers/mysteries + some het cuteness here and there. Hoping I really enjoy the kdramas I'm planning on watching this month so that I can have a top 10 instead of top 8",

Reply 1988 - the one that made me nostalgic for a time and place I\u2019ve never been. \n4. Coffee Prince - the one that made me want to believe in pure love that transcends gender and circumstances  \n5. 2521 - the one that is like a love letter to youth and growing up  \n6. When the weather is fine - the one that took me on a beautiful melancholic journey of healing against beautiful snowy scenery\n7. Hometown Cha Cha Cha - the one that made me giddy and romantic  \n8. Lovestruck in the city - the one that exhibited how exhilarating and devastating falling in love can be as well as how painful and confusing it is to everyone around you when you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t like who you are  \n9. Arthdal chronicles- the one that proved that Korea can bring a top tier fantasy show to life  \n10. Vincenzo- the one that blew my mind with its creative storyline and its hilarious twists and turns  \n\nHonorary mentions: amongst my favorite shows are also love all play, our beloved summer and bad and crazy that should have totally made the list.",

            "comment": "Honestly I'm not confident that the show's quality will turn around in the last 3 weeks because the crew already wrapped up filming this week. Which means it was prefilmed and that makes it even more of a letdown. I would understand if the show turned out this way because it was filmed live because studios are more desperate to win the ratings game in a live format and so the show is produced more haphazardly, suffers a lot of last minute rewrites/reshoots, etc. But gosh it was done without that added pressure and this was still the best they could do with it? Not to mention they postponed the release date too? \n\nThe show isn't an abortion like Why Her or Thirty Nine, it's still watchable. But I don't connect with the story at any level anymore the way I used to. Everything feels so half baked. The scenes between Kokdu and Gyejeol are kind of dry and the only thing that seems to be keeping it alive are the scenes between Kokdu, Oksin and Gaksin and maybe that's why they seem to be having more scenes with each other lately than the actual lead couple. Even that threesome has lost its luster somewhat because there's a lack of growth in their relationship. If this were a well written KDrama this would be the point where they would show another dimension to their relationship than just master or underling and show a layer that feels more familial. They're at least trying to do that as of episode 10 but it still devolves into Kokdu physically abusing the two instead of actually doing something that shows that he regards the two as parental/older sibling figures.\n\nI only watched because of KJH and it took me a whole week to get through episodes 9 and 10. Imagine this is the only KDrama I watch these days because of time constraints. It's just sad. \n\nIt makes me wonder how much offscreen politics or input from the actors' management is affecting the final output. It's like the script is written as a vehicle to showcase certain actors' talents or preserve their public images rather than in the service of an actual story.",

You should probably wait until the show ends, which is its 16th episode, to see what everyone's thoughts are.",

As a TV show, it feels disjointed and overacted sometimes while the actors, especially KJH, are great.",

I realllly liked the ML from Mr. Queen (only drama of his that I've watched).  \n\nI researched about him yesterday because of this and found he was a rude rude man with seohyun in their drama Time. Apparently he was abused by his ex (Seo Yea-ji\ud83d\ude31) but I think that doesn't give him an excuse to ruin the actress and the writers time and mental health. Im shocked that I wasn't aware of this until now. Apparently he was abusive as well. Just overall abusive relationship.\n\nEdit - why the downvotes y'all? What did I do? \ud83d\ude2d",

Not only there is no evidence of his demands vs hers, but as you said she didn\u2019t seem to be constrained by them as much as him even if such messages existed and were deleted, as her agency said. Anyway, the content of the leaked chat wasn\u2019t denied by either of them, and in my opinion what was said in it was well beyond a \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship. I\u2019m not going to bring up whatever else was said about her because she was an easy target at one point so I\u2019m not sure how true that even is, but I don\u2019t think the actual evidence we have is in her favor. This whole thing was considered a \u201cscandal\u201d, while allegations of abuse need to be treated seriously, including emotional abuse. But yeah, we\u2019ll never really know what happened, I just hope there was the least amount possible of suffering involved, honestly",

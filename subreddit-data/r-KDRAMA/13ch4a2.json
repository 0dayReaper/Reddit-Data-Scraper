    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.  If you are using Markdown and not  Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way  to create spoiler tags is to use  &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without  spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I can\u2019t help but compare and contrast these two dramas. Both have interesting premises but the way romance was woven into Happiness was far superior.\n\nI would never have tried Happiness if not for this sub (I\u2019m not into zombies!) but I\u2019m so glad to have watched it. It\u2019s a treatise on human nature wrapped in a series about a zombie-pandemic with a beautiful friends-to-lovers story in the background. Where else am I going to find that?",

The zombies were a pretty obvious metaphor and the show is more about class struggles and human nature than it is about anything actually supernatural although it has some gorey scenes and jumpscares. I would not say they are the focus though.",

I recommend if you like anime, it is also emotional maybe similar to **Your Name** (maybe I wrote this already somewhere in this sub but I don\u2019t remember..lol)\n\nI also watched **Tetris** the movie and it\u2019s very interesting on how those games such as Sega, Atari and Nintendo were competing against each other. Also, I learned the game was invented by a Russian guy when the country was still USSR which means\u2026 they had a lot of problems getting the video game out of the country. This is not a spoiler cause there are documentaries about it and news too. \n\nI\u2019m sad **Jinnys Kitchen** is finished. I was really enjoying seeing Park Seo Joon with Choi Woo Shik and Yu Mi, plus V. He did s really good job and I knew some people would recognize him and start fangirling in the restaurant. My only complaint is that there were too many PPLs. I missed Youn and maybe next time they could put another actress in the group since she\u2019s busy with other projects.",

            "comment": "So I binged **While You Were Sleeping** (2017, 16 eps) on Hulu and instead of a full review, I want to concentrate on one thing. Firstly, though, I had that Sandra Bullock movie stuck in my head so I was glad to see this drama wasn't anything like that. Instead it's a neat \"pay it forward\" type thriller where characters who have saved each others' lives begin to have prophetic dreams related to the person who saved them or who they've saved, and then they grapple with the consequences of trying to avert fate.\n\nStarring Lee Jong Suk, Bae Suzy, and Jung Hae-in as the \"love triangle\" bound together by circumstance, everyone does a good job, and there are some really fun and funny and touching moments, and some wonderful discourse on the nature of fate, revenge, and compromise.\n\nBut what really struck me was the primary antagonist, Attorney Lee Yoo-beom (Lee Sang-yeob). Yoo-beom is shown to have been a manipulator from an early age, always willing to compromise his barely-there ethical standards to maintain his cushy position. His pangs of guilt -- physically expressed by multiple scenes of him scrubbing his hands to the point of bleeding after each compromise -- are only seen when he's alone. When he's observed, his calm, assured, vaguely oily mannerisms are all there like a mask between him and the world.\n\nOver the course of 16 episodes, his arc can really go either way. Those who have watched 'til the end know his final trajectory, but the scenes of other characters trying to reach him through his mask of bravado are tense and dramatically fraught. I can't say enough about the performances and Lee Sang-yeob's in general. I've only seen him in one other show (**Signal**), but was really impressed here and will add a couple of his shows to my watch list based on the strength of his performance in WYWS alone.\n\nApart from that, WYWS was just a really solid and enjoyable drama, imo. Won't be my favorite but I enjoyed it and was never tempted to stop watching.",

                    "comment": "This was my experience with WYWS too and it is my go to recommendation when someone asks for a bingeable series. It\u2019s a gripping series from episode 1 to the end. Is it excellent? No. Will you remember it for a long time afterwards? Also no.\n\nLee Sang Yeob was great as a villain - yes! Watching him now in **Once Again** and he is a totally different character (empathetic doctor). He\u2019s a versatile actor!\n\nAnd oh another highlight of WYWS for me was Kang Ki Yong\u2019s arc as a &gt;!creepy psycho serial killer!&lt;. We always see him as a funny side character so this was a surprise!",

The pacing was very off to me and the protagonist wasn\u2019t an interesting character.  On the plus side, it has some of that cool Miike style, I liked the production design, and Go Kyung Pyo delivers an awesome performance.  I gave it a 6/10.",

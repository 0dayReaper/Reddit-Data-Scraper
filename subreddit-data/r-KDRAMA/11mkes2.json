Only the top 0.01% of children go to this school. The upcoming K-drama will showcase love, revenge, jealousy, and compassion among teens.\n\nGranted, the setting is a high school rather than a private academy, but it sounds like the drama will encompass many of the same competitive education themes as **CCiR**.\n\nMy favorite line from the article is the description of his potential character:\n\n&gt;Lee Chae Min got the offer to play the role of Kang Ha. He is a scholar at Jusin High School. He has plain and soft looks and has the charm of a large dog.",

Hope they also get to act in lead roles soon.\r\r\n\nCcir did show the competitive education system of Korea, and I enjoyed the drama, but the way it glorified private academies (PA) didn't sit well with me. Like sending indirect messages that schools are not enough and students can't do well by themselves is very discouraging. \r\r\n\nAlso, practice is not everything, having a clear basic knowledge is important and oftentimes school lectures and thorough textbook studying is enough for that. Students who grow up solving practice sheets with PAs and acing the exams often find it tough to adjust to universities without external supports. \r\r\n\nBut PAs are so glorified everywhere here in asia that moms hesitate to take risks and put their children in the grueling school-pa-study-eat-sleep cycle. I was lucky that I only had to endure a few months of PA before my college entrance exams, my nieces and nephews are being grinded since they were in elementary schools. I have tried explaining to my sisters that being too dependent on PAs would decrease their self problem solving abilities, but they are too afraid to take risks. And with dramas like ccir, idt anyone is going to question the pa culture. \n\r\nSorry for the unwanted rant. I couldn't help it.",

Seol Inah my love!\r\n\nOn a less savory note, some fool found me on this sub and DM'ed me to \"talk about kdramas\" and pretty much immediately tried to turn it NSFW, so THAT was certainly classy.

Chae Jong Hyeop (ML) is adorable as actor turned CEO, and the FL (Seo Eun-Soo) is strong but learns great teamwork lessons. Kim Sung-oh as \"Uncle Bubblegum\" is a stand out. \n\nThe show's cameos are delightful, too! Loved it.\n\nEdit to say there's a real sadness at some of the character fates but I felt most sad for Mr. Nam. He's an object lesson in not being a lackey.",

            "comment": "I'm disappointed and frustrated at the rating that *Kokdu: Season of Deity* has received overall on Viki. It absolutely doesn't deserve 8.8/9 - a ridiculous rating for something like this. (This, given that on Viki, anything below 9.4 means it's okay, but not great, and the best are 9.6/7 - this means very excellent. 9 is pretty low, and below nine means it's basically not worth watching and is usually B-grade or worse). It's not so much about personal opinions, which obviously are what this system grades, but a gap between actual value and what people have given it. 9.3, for example, would much better represent what it is, and people's differing tastes, because it is unique and not for all. \n\nPeople there - and, perhaps, elsewhere - can be really mean about shows or actors they don't like. I think that if you don't like a type of story, you don't need to give a bad rating, but just realise it's not your sort of thing. I've given 6 before, but that's my lowest, and for shows I've finished watching (this isn't even done airing yet) and which gave a bad taste and feeling afterwards - being really weird, or having poor acting overall, or a bad storyline, etc. This is just not a show that deserves that sort of rating, and it means that others are going to be less likely to watch it, because they trust the ratings. Yet, it's a pretty good show, and personal tastes aside, has some excellent and unique things to it. It's definitely not worse (and is a lot better) than many shows which received higher ratings there. The thing is, you rely on ratings to an extent, because you can't go trawling through all the shows that *might* be good, but got unfairly rated due to silly reasons or personal vendettas. (Or not being translated into Spanish). Ratings tell you which ones to consider and look at more carefully to figure out yourself between them.",

If only those who liked the show were rating it, the rating would be useless. Of course only looking at the rating can be misleading, E.g. you don't know whether an average rating is caused by a high disparity of opinions or people agreeing to the series being mediocre. But being angry at people for not liking a series and giving it a bad rating is absurd.",

There are some lower ratings for more balanced reviews. Obviously, some people are going to give things lower ratings. I'm talking about - as I've explained - ratings given for unbalanced reasons, and those given without a fuller understanding of the story/show. Mainly, after 1 or a few episodes. This is what I mean by the sentence you've quoted. Realising it after 1 or a few episodes. If you watch the whole thing, and feel this way, then that's a fair rating. \n\nJust this sentence, though, on its own is out of context. My opinion is better shown by the whole comment.",

People might not find it to their taste, but as far as the quality goes, it's evidently above shows with higher ratings on there, and as good as others with such ratings. Reading the comments people made with their ratings, it appears that they've done it because they don't like the female character - not getting that she's supposed to be dorky, along with her brother - or that the story is confusing - it's supposed to be strange and crazy - or that they don't like the actress or actor. Or that it hasn't been translated into Spanish. Many have just watched 1 or 3 episodes, then given that rating - there's no way you can understand a story from that and give it a fair assessment. This is what I mean about realising a show isn't for you; you don't have to mark it down because it didn't appeal to you. If you watched the whole thing - which is impossible for this, because it's still going - and had that opinion at the end, after giving it a fair go, that sits better. \n\nI watched the first few episodes of *The Forbidden Marriage*, and wasn't sure about it. I wanted to watch enough to know if I should keep going. Each episode, there were more hints that it wasn't for me. By the last one I watched, I knew for sure it wasn't, and felt uncomfortable and annoyed at it. So I stopped watching - but didn't give it a rating. That wouldn't have been fair. I just let it go and watched the things that do appeal to me. However, shows that I've finished, or mostly watched, I would rate, because after that long, I have a good idea of how it's supposed to go and all the aspects. And I wouldn't rate it based on one character or actor, but all the elements.",

Cruel creators!! My poor dohwa didn't deserve that much pain \u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160!&lt;  \n\n\np.s. i don't get it why would mods not approve of this post when i have literally seen similar post approved on this sub from year ago can anyone tell me why is that? also if i don'tget any replies then what will i do since they won't allow my post and here i am not sure. this is so unfair tbh\n\nEdit: I'm pissed at mods, like bro why can't you approve it, there is no way i would get answers on a discussion thread, still i did post here, but the reach is small, like please then whats the purpose of this sub if i can't post?!",

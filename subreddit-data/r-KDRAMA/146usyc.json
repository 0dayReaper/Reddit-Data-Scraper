When he meets Cheon Sa Rang, her sincere smile is at the ready. The pair seek to create happy moments where they can smile brightly at each other.  King of the Land is a VVIP business lounge, a paradise catering to wealthy hoteliers. It is owned by The King Group, with hotels, distribution companies, and an airline in its portfolio. Now Goo Won has been thrown into an inheritance tug-of-war. \u00a0With his brilliant mind,\u00a0innate grace, and captivating charm, he has everything but lacks common sense when dating.  Cheon Sa Rang makes the world brighter with just her smile. She is thrilled to land a job at the King Hotel, where she had some of her happiest times as a child. She must now put those sweet memories away and mature quickly to face the frequent workplace prejudices and misunderstandings that come her way. \n* Director: Im Hyun-wook (*Reflection of You*)\n* Screenwriter: Choi Ran\n* Teaser/Trailer: [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGF16szMOmo&amp;pp=ygUVa2luZyB0aGUgbGFuZCBuZXRmbGl4)\n* Streaming: Netflix\n\n[tvN' See You in My 19th Life](https://mydramalist.com/716735-see-you-in-my-19th-life)\n\nPremieres **June 17 (Saturday)**\n\n* Cast: Shin Hye-sun (*Mr. Queen*), Ahn Bo-hyun (*Military Prosecutor Doberman*), Ha Yoon-kyung (*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*), Ahn Dong-goo (*The Law Cafe*)\n* Synopsis: Ban Ji Eum has an extraordinary ability: she can remember the memories of all her past lives. Repeating her reincarnation for nearly a thousand years, Ban Ji Eum has been living her lives diligently. After her previous life is cut short by a tragic accident, she sets out to reconnect with the people of her past life in her current one, and decides to find a man named Moon Seo Ha whom she met in her 18th life. Will memories of her 18th life sabotage romance in her 19th? Or will love endure across different lives?  On the other side, there is also Yoon Cho Won, a landscape architect and the younger sister of Yoon Joo Won, whose life collapsed after her older sister's death. She is courageous and kind even after facing the death of her beloved sister but she struggles to maintain her brightness. When Yoon Cho Won meets Ban Ji Eum by chance and sees her older sister in her, she wonders about Ban Ji Eum\u2019s identity.  Then there's Ha Do Yoon, Moon Seo Ha\u2019s secretary and best friend since childhood. Although they come from completely different backgrounds, Ha Do Yoon feels some kind of affinity for him. \n* Director: Lee Na-jung (*Mine*)\n* Screenwriter: Choi Young-rim\n* Teaser/Trailer: [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orAIH67EU-I&amp;pp=ygUfc2VlIHlvdSBpbiBteSAxOXRoIGxpZmUgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D)\n* Streaming: Netflix\n\nAll info are compiled based from MDL, Google searches and respective streaming pages.

It is like if random pieces of entertainment that take place in California and US were fed into an AI and then that AI was asked to produce those characters. The result is so confusing, yet so entertaining. \n\nAt this point, I am trying to figure out who is the creepiest amoung the two, Young-do or Kim Tam. It is a tight race. That love triangle is getting so ridiculously unhealthy that it almost feels like a prank. I am starting running out of face palms. \n\nKim Tam ep 8 &gt;!\" Get out of my house tomorrow. You can't? You still want to go to school? Then, like me from now on, with your whole heart if it's possible. Because I like you.\"!&lt; \n\n\"Looooove is the mooooment\" starts playing in the background. \n\n&gt;!\"So I am going to get involved in your affairs at school and I am going to invade your privacy.\"!&lt; \n\nOMG ... The size of that red flag. I think it can cover planet Earth and generale an artificial winter. \n\nIt feels like if someone who hates soap operas was tasked to write one, so they made some aspects so exaggerated that it turned into a satire of the genre. \n\nSome other points. Park Hyung-Shik is sooo adorable in this. He looks so young! OMG, those cheeks. \n\nAnd I like Kim Tan's Sweaters. I think they are epic!",

The key is making characters that are different, so the audience forgets the clich\u00e9d setting. That's what I'm good at, and that is what I find fun. I want people to think, 'I've seen something like this before, but still this is strangely fun.'\"",

Like an other redditor said, it is really the music that makes it a romance and not a thriller. \n\nEdit :  From a purely realistic point of view, that looks more like a situation where, in the future, the rich guy would treat his lower-class wife like crap, because he is the \"provider\". He might even lose all his money because of his incompetence and she would be stuck working two jobs, raising their kids alone. OMG, I would pay to see that sequel to Heirs. Scruffy Kim Tan, still wearing the same sweaters but now with stains and holes. \n\nBut not everything has to be realistic and realism is definitely not what we are going for here. Instead, it is entertaining to see the lens that the show provides, especially when it gives some exaggerated takes.",

I didn\u2019t feel like I was misreading the subtext but I also thought he was her brother, so my face during that scene had to be the definition of these two emojis: \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udee3 Anyway, very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t actually her brother lol!&lt;",

There are only a handful of dramas that got me obsessed with them and it\u2019s just really hard to find something as captivating. Will definitely finish call it love though!",

Also i really don't get why so many say the FL is bad at acting. No one ever says that when it's a male character acting stoic or having subtle emotions... i think this show is quite flawed, but i'm still enjoying it a lot. Even though i did get massive spoilers lol.\n\nAlso, i still haven't managed to watch the last to episodes of Big Mouth. I really want to, but i already heard about the ending and it will break my heart :')",

I like the idea of the story as it's set in Silla, which I find very fascinating.  I just looked at old views to remanence in the old hype and can see it's reception was terrible. I am now scared to continue. \n\nI finished My sassy girl, but I found the ending anticlimactic/sorta flat.",

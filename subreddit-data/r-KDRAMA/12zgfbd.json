He comes from a small  rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae  Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul \u2013 and the same university \u2013  after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends.  Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone \u2013 and share a kiss. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a  fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?

            "comment": "This show was absolute perfection from beginning to end and the chemistry between the leads was out of this world. Although I was spoiled for some of the moments, seeing them played out, especially the one with the Conan Grey song, was super emotional.\n\nOne thing I particularly loved about the show was that the women were well-rounded and lived in characters. They were there for the leads, but they had lives and interests of their own and, with the exception of Eun Ji, they felt like women I\u2019d love to hang out with. I also nearly died when the Restaurant Lady called Jae Won \u2018oppa\u2019.\n\nI appreciated what the show had to say about mental health too. Jae Won isn\u2019t magically freed from depression because Jihyun loves him and will probably continue to need support from his therapist and medication. I loved that the therapist challenged his beliefs about himself in episode 9 and showed him the impact that his actions were having on Jihyun. Although he may not have been ready to accept it in the moment, it clearly started to percolate throughout the episode. \n\nI\u2019m really going to miss them all (NOT YOU EUN JI).",

            "comment": "the end of episode 9 is so beautiful it had me in tears. \n\n&gt;!jae won, comforted by the presence of water, sits beside the han river at night; it\u2019s a wonderfully shot scene, one which perfectly captures the city lights and reflections of that time of day. toes just touching the surface of the river, he can\u2019t help but recall all the times the waves have washed over his feet as he sat in the sand. the sea brings memories of ji hyun, happy ones. flashbacks to all their meaningful moments allow jae won to remember, and long for, the joy and comfort he feels in ji hyun\u2019s presence. realising the preciousness of what he\u2019s given up, jae won\u2019s eyes fill with emotion. loss? regret? hope? realisation? epiphany? a sea of feeling, and a glimmer of light.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!the conan gray song, which plays right through to the credits, tells us a different but not unrelated story: \u201ca boy and a boy, best friends with each other, but always wished they were more\u201d. music builds a bridge between these two characters, just as it brought them closer on their first journey to the sea. we see jae won find the courage to finally open the messages he\u2019d been so determined not to accept; in doing so, he takes the hand that\u2019s been stretched out to him. cut to ji hyun, who sees those little 1s disappear in real time, something he\u2019s been waiting and hoping for for so long. what follows is the return of a smile to jae won\u2019s face \u2014 an honest smile meant for no one but himself \u2014 as he walks talks towards ji hyun. he\u2019s accompanied by the music in his ears and the promise of future happiness, trusting that there\u2019s someone patiently waiting for him and finally seeing that he\u2019s deserving of that love.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!**the simplicity of ji hyun\u2019s words, spoken aloud so as to better help reality sink in: \u201che\u2019s here.\u201d**!&lt;\n\n&gt;!perhaps my favourite shot is that of jae won, out of focus as he determinedly walks towards the camera; his image becomes clear only at the point he smiles at the man standing before him. similarly, ji hyun gradually comes into focus, but unlike jae won, he was already standing still; three steps ahead, he waits for jae won to catch up at his own pace. no rush or pressure, just gentle reassurance. their smiles here are the sincerest of them all, filled with all the relief and apologies and hope and happiness that the moment brings.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!two profiles on either side of the screen, separated only momentarily before sharing *that* kiss, one accompanied by pinks, purples, blues, greens\u2026 a rainbow of light.!&lt;\n\nwatching this drama these past few weeks has been a unique, magical, and at times rather stressful experience; i\u2019ve truly never felt so desperate to know the ending of a story. there\u2019s so much beauty and meaning here, so much comfort offered by its story and the words of its characters. i\u2019m certain to return to this drama many times over the coming months and years, and would recommend it to anyone. i don\u2019t think the term \u201cart\u201d should be reserved only for creations of a certain quality (it\u2019s all art! the good and the bad haha) but this truly is *art*. love it :)",

Watching them sort out their relationship, and then being proper boyfriends.....being tentative but also confident, finding out new things about each other, reveling in the feeling of togetherness, finally being the youngsters they are......it was overwhelming in the best way!!&lt;\n\nThis has to be the most complete romance I have seen in a long while. I believed everything about them, I felt everything they were going through. The only critique I can make is that the colour coding was a bit too much at times (this show didn't need such a heavy artistic hand). But that's a tiny issue and the show remains a 10/10. In the midst of all the fast food BLs, this one was a 5-course meal. Hope this team comes up with a new show ASAP \u2764\ufe0f",

Excellent acting and cinematography, a perfect OST, and a tight storyline that never falters. I wanted to make sure to point out some of my favorite things:\n\n* The evolution of Ji Hyun's character is so cool to watch. Not that he changed, but that as his confidence grew he blossomed. \n\n* In the last episode I kept waiting for some kind of confrontation to happen at the party with the Eun Ji or Tae Hyung but it DIDN'T and that was such a relief. And Jae Won's casual \"sure people can know about us\" when I was expecting him to be more nervous and cautious. Thank you for subverting my expectations! \n\n* The female friends all rocked so much, what a treat. And Yoon Won, get it girl!\n\n* Almost forgot! I love that Ji Hyun kept trying to get Jae Won to stay over and was aiming to leave the party early. Sometimes Korean shows can feel a bit sexless even when there is physical intimacy, so showing that desire in a new relationship beyond just the NC scene was great.",

I call a kdrama a gem when I come across a drama to watch without knowing much about the plot, or not caring about how popular or highly rated a drama is.\n\nI think this is the best Korean BL drama I've seen at this point based on my kdrama watching history. The dialogue was very thought-provoking and inspiring. The ending was well done as well. I always like those endings where it's like a narration kind of ending in the final scenes. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThe directing and production is so unique compared to other kdramas and the music really set the mood as well as the \"silent dialogue-only no background music\" scenes. I am glad all the conflicts were resolved with the various  \"villains\" in the finale episode.\n\nI'd like to have a friend like Ji Hyun's school roommate friend Joon Pyo too, and maybe someone like Ae Ri as well. I like how Ae Ri is so good at reading in between the lines and being so supportive! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nGoodbye to this amazing drama! \ud83d\ude2d",

From the surfing club meetings to the &gt;!final party when they're talking with different people (and making out with a person they just met)!&lt;. It all feels very real to me and gives the series a slice of life feel that I've rarely seen on a tv show (of any genre or nationality), for some reason this didn't feel fake.\n\n  \nThe &gt;!kiss on episode 9 was absolutely fantastic! JiHyun going for a second round of open mouth kisses was beautiful. Also, horny JiHyun wanting to leave the party as soon as possible was really fun to watch!&lt;.\n\nI loved how JiHyun realised &gt;!(thanks to his friends) why JaeWon needed time and came up with the idea of a new camera, and how that lead to them being back together. There are many things left to talk about: JaeWon's career choice and his parents reaction to that, or their reaction to him being out (I guess someone will tell them about it), so I'm hoping we get a new season of this show!&lt;.",

I feel like we saw everything we needed to see and I don\u2019t think a second season delving into the family dynamic and everything else would really add much. Real life doesn\u2019t end in neat little bows where everything ends up perfect, and I don\u2019t think every story should be like that either. Like we can assume that they\u2019ll still have a lot of hardship between the abusive family, Jihyun needing to go to the military eventually, Jaewon\u2019s depression, the age gap, being gay in an incredibly homophobic society, etc. But we don\u2019t need to see all of that because the story we are shown is about the story of Jihyun and Jaewon and how they both grew through their relationship together. That alone is as much of their story as I feel I need to see. \n\nBut who knows maybe a new season would be really good. I mean, I really liked the sequel to I Told Sunset About You, so maybe if they did make a second season they would prove me wrong.",

I'm so used to tv characters telling their friends annoying advice like play hard to get, don't text back, flirt with other people, but no! These guys gave reasonable thoughtful advice after listening to Ji Hyun. Love that. And Joon Pyo showing him the sns pic at the end haha. hilarious.\n* The close-up shot of Yoon Won holding back tears was a bit much for me... But not the worst. And I appreciated Jae Won's reaction. I think seeing his friend having a hard time and comforting her helped him. \n* Ji Hyun's reaction to Eun Ji forcing herself on/kissing Jae Won was priceless. His face oml.\n* And then Jae Won actually &gt;!broke up with her!!&lt; Love that! And I was impressed with how he handled that. Like didn't attribute it to him being gay or even liking Ji Hyun. I love that so much! Just because he likes Ji Hyun now doesn't mean their relationship meant nothing. It was nice to finally hear his side of the story there. \n* And Jae Won meeting Ji Hyun's boss! Such a fun interaction. She is a delight. So glad she's there for Ji Hyun, and Jae Won sees that. \n* And the last scene wow. &gt;!The kiss.!&lt; Chef's kiss.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, cute corny little shows are great and have their place too (I\u2019ve watched plenty), but there\u2019s definitely a lack of stories that feel full and depict actual struggles that lgbtq+ people go through, whether it\u2019s related to being lgbtq+ directly or not. The issue with the current sphere of BLs (specifically Korean ones) is that because of the lack of really meaningful stories like this one, it makes it all too easy to make being gay into a caricature that lacks any semblance of actual humanity. Being gay is hard, especially in Korea, and especially in addition to all of the other pressures that come with being a young adult in current society. It\u2019s important to have BLs that show that side as well. This BL definitely delivered on that front, and as such this show was incredibly cathartic to me in so many ways that 99% of others I\u2019ve seen never had been.",

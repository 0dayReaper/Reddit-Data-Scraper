The guy he woke up with made more of an impact in much shorter screentime.\n\nOr maybe 14 minutes is too little to get the feel of the characters. Let's see what we get today.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nI'm just not feeling SeungJun. Maybe there has been an overdose of characters battling anxiety/trauma after The Eight Sense and Bed Friend. I do like JaeHyun and the other two guys but the show hasn't wowed me yet and we are already 25 per cent done. Am dropping this for now, will pick it up after it's finished if the reviews are good.",

It felt as if the story progressed in each episode (plus great chemistry).  \n\nSeungJun seems a bit bland, but the premise is interesting. I\u2019ll continue watching next week.\n\nAlso agree with the Surfer looking more interesting than the leads \ud83d\ude05",

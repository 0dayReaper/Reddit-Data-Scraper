    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.  If you are using Markdown and not  Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way  to create spoiler tags is to use  &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without  spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I thought it was going to be a movie but it\u2019s a series, probably a romcom. And it\u2019s supposed to air this year. \n\nI tried to find the date but it\u2019s nowhere to be found. Its *not* on MDL either maybe cause it\u2019s not a Korean production but an HBO one. \n\nSince the series is in Portuguese, the girl is from S\u00e3o Paulo - Brazil and the kpop idol group is from Korea (main lead is Kim Woojin), it\u2019s probably going to have a limited release\u2026 I mean, only in selected countries which would be Brazil, Korea and maybe\u2026 in North America since HBO is American. One can only hope. \n\nThe plot will be very simple, a romcom, and with all the tropes since it seems to be for teenagers. But my interest in this series is the acting, cinematography and maybe a well written romcom. I don\u2019t expect big and unexpected plot twists, but something I can enjoy while relaxing that maybe it\u2019s worth rewatching in the future. There are many of those dramas out there but I\u2019m curious to know why they chose Brazil \u2026 and it might be interesting to see the kpop guys speaking in Portuguese (maybe?)\n\nI\u2019ll keep checking their page and hope they finally set up a date.",

I\u2019m watching LotBS right now (my first JJH drama) and not only is she so beautiful, but she\u2019s also paired up with Lee Minho who is equally as beautiful. Usually the pairings aren\u2019t that even (one is usually more beautiful than the other) so I\u2019m just in awe of them as a \u201ccouple\u201d. I think for me, it would have to be yoona (from snsd) when she smiles. I guess it\u2019s a different kind of beautiful though. Hers is girl next door while jun ji Hyun is like drop dead gorgeous kind.",

I know there are some writing and directing issues and the show\u2019s a bit too cheesy early on but it\u2019s my go-to comfort drama because it gives me *all* the feels.\n\nThey were cute together at the HPL [press conference](https://youtu.be/XLZYNxBFr60) and [interviews](https://youtu.be/qRazGf5ytCE).\n\nThere are also many cute behind-the-scenes clips that were exclusive to the Japanese DVDs. I included links to some of them in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/nqdco6/kdrama_female_leads_dont_hug_back/h0bqpia/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) from a few years ago.\n\nAnd if you like Kim Jae-uck, I highly recommend Crazy Love.",

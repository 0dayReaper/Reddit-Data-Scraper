Zombie theme isn't my cup of tea at all but I LOVED them and watched for them\ud83e\udd70 next two months will be full of edits and fanart haha\n\nMy favorite contract couple that far, because they were friends and comfortable around each other. They topped my OTP list (along with Because This Is My First Life leads)",

But while Wang Kyung Tae was attracted to Oh Young Sim, she wasn\u2019t so keen. Regardless, he was always around, making his affection for her known. Then, his family abruptly moved to the United States, and the duo lost contact with one another. Twenty years later, Oh Young Sim has become a TV producer who makes variety shows. Although she always tries her hardest to score a ratings hit, her TV shows almost invariably **TANK** (*just like this drama. Enjoy your 0% ratings, production team!*) \u2013 and get canceled! Oh Young Sim hopes to turn over a new leaf when she is given the opportunity to create a pilot for a new romance-themed entertainment show. She decides that she will do whatever it takes to make the show successful. Oh Young Sim wants to cast a hot, eligible bachelor in the show. As such, she decides upon a startup CEO named Mark Wang for the role. But when he arrives for the filming, she suddenly realizes that he is none other than Wang Kyung Tae \u2013 all grown up...and exceptionally handsome to boot! What will happen when these childhood friends must reunite after all these years? Does Wang Kyung Tae still feel the same way about Oh Young Sim?\n* **Genre**: Romantic comedy\n* **Previous Discussions**: [Episodes 1 &amp; 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/13k0rxm/oh_youngsim_episodes_1_2/)|[Episodes 3 &amp; 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/13popln/oh_youngshim_episodes_3_4/)|[Episodes 5 &amp; 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/13va5ht/oh_youngshim_episodes_5_6/)|[Episodes 7 &amp; 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/141xhva/oh_youngshim_episodes_7_8/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).

However, I couldn't help but think of how this drama could have been *actually* good had they evenly distributed those moments of sincerity in ep 10 all throughout the entire show instead of just cramming it all like crazy in the finale. They would have been able to explore the different story arcs with more depth and substance. \n\nidk it just makes me sad to think about, especially since I genuinely liked the finale. And it sucks that I won't be seeing more of Gyeongtae and Youngshim as a couple but here we are anyway (and I doubt there would be a S2. Would anyone even still be interested??)",

            "comment": "This show is a 2.5 at the most for me. At least I got a few cheap laughs and the dating shows were a little interesting to watch.\n\nEpisode 9 was mid to me. They cleared up their &gt;!20 year misunderstanding!&lt; right at the end. The entire show we\u2019ve just watched them dance around each other. Kyeong Tae wanted his cheap revenge and Youngsim was just all over the place.\n\nEpisode 10 was bad. They finally &gt;!get together,!&lt; although they lack chemistry. The only thing pulling them together is their childhood connection where YS didn\u2019t even like him till the very end!! They had minimal romantic development as adults. Anyways, they &gt;!get together\u2026 and then there\u2019s a misunderstanding halfway through the episode \ud83e\udee0 I would\u2019ve at least expected KT to say something since this was a semi repeat of the past. Instead, he goes off on YS and she\u2019s clueless as to what happened. He then resolves to leave without saying anything and they have that awfully dramatic breakup like what are they upset for?! Once again, there\u2019s been no romantic development between them \ud83d\ude2d and then there\u2019s a timeskip and he comes back to beg?? His reasoning for breaking up with her could\u2019ve been cleared up with a convo but he\u2019s saying he\u2019s not confident and likes her more again??? And then they\u2019re basically back to their childhood dynamic at the end,!&lt; it\u2019s crazy. \n\nOverall, the leads suck together. Why the &gt;!YouTuber and the 2nd lead end up together!&lt;, I don\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t even come off as shallow but in the voiceover Youngshim says they both found someone like each other?? Also, what happened to the high school couple?? So many questions but I don\u2019t even want them answered. This show was so bad, from the plot to acting. I hope all of them pick better projects next \ud83d\ude2d",

            "comment": "The last episode was trash and I hated it.\n\nThe show as a whole was a nice blend of dumb and cute. Over the top and exaggerated at times, but still fun and lighthearted. \n\n&gt;!The thing with the kids that mirrored Young Shim and Kyung Tae's relationship was left up in the air, YS's hoobae and the awful youtuber friend ending up together wasn't needed, the thing with the hickey was hugely unnecessary and badly executed (the make up kept clearly getting rubbed off and ruined the continuity), and the last conflict they decided to throw in there was half baked at best.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Also, they kinda ruined Kyung Tae this last episode. Them having a misunderstanding because of poor communication as children and KT being hurt and running away was understandable. As a fully grown man, the fact that he did it again was stupid. He never talked to her or let her know what was bothering him or even what was going on in his life, but somehow still expected YS to read his mind and always know what was going on? I hated that. Was she utterly clueless? Yes. Did that make her come off as if she didn't care about KT's feelings? Maybe. BUT HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING! Even when she prompted him to let her know what was going on with him, like in the car scene, he chose to not say anything to her. Let her know you're feeling ignored. Let her know there is an issue with your company and that you have to go away for a time to fix it. It would have been as simple as him saying \"I'm putting you above my job and company and I'd like you to do the same\".Would that really have been so hard?  Especially since they'd promised to be honest with each other at the beginning of the episode. And then he comes back penniless and she starts low key bullying him again? Ugh! Why?!&lt;",

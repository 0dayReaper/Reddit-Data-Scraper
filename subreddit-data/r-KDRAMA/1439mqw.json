I assume, given she is co-lead of the show, we will somehow see her return in some way? The drama just doesn't feel the same without her. !&lt;\n\nThe acting from the cast has been really good. The Queen Bee Mother is an absolute scene stealer.\n\nI do like how they are building up the mystery &gt;!behind the killing !&lt;though.",

I loved the scene of all the Dads subtly showing off their super-expensive watches. It's not just the women who are petty, the men are pretty nasty too. \n\nI read somewhere that the director of this show is the same as Woman of Dignity. I had loved that one, and I hope they manage to keep it as tight and interesting till the end.",

Said it before but I love the heavy importance of social media usage in this show. Good ol fashion petty,erratic and power hungry moms. Kinda creepy too. Nice little mysteries. This is fun.\n\nI sympathize with the Mi ho. Love that she isn't a pushover. I don't plan on having kids but something parental kicked in seeing one of the girls follow her to the elevator.\n\nNayoung is good at pissing me off. She's so bad at being a mean girl.I'd clown her everytime we crossed paths on the playground.\n\nThough he'd be super annoying irl,I like simp boy Jin Seop. I'm curious to see how he'll develop as the show progresses.",

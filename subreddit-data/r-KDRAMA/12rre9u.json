He comes from a small rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul \u2013 and the same university \u2013 after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends. Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone \u2013 and share a kiss. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?

The way he was looking at JiHyun in the cafeteria was heartbreaking. It was like looking at JiHyun from a distance is all he can allow himself to do now.\n\nJiHyun knows how much JaeWon cares and he ain't giving up. He has come into his own under JaeWon's gentle guardianship, and his new found confidence showed in the way he helped JaeWon during the disciplinary hearing as well as the confrontation with the bitchy ex. I hope he won't lose confidence after that talk with JaeWon and will keep trying to break down his walls. \n\nI'm not ready to say bye to these two next week \ud83d\ude2d",

I spent the whole week thinking that Ep.6's ending was just a bad dream and &gt;!Jae Won was going to wake up in Ji Hyun's arms.!&lt;\n\nAfter thinking about it a little, the main theme seems to be fixing Jae Won's wounds. He's the type of guy who could spend his entire life being closed off and borderline depressed (or actually depressed) because he has no model of a healthy personal relationship. His family is abusive, his ex-GF is a narcissistic psycho, and his so-called friends are a bit douchy.\n\nEnters Ji Hyun, who despite looking mousy and tentative at the beginning, is actually coming into his own in college as a 20-year-old should. He has a strong support network that he is expanding and he's pursuing his dreams and being himself. The &gt;!coming out scene!&lt; with his best friend was so well done!\n\nI can't even imagine what the trauma from &gt;!Ji Hyun almost dying!&lt; must have been for Jae Won. He had just stepped out of his walls to experience love and the fear of losing it all clearly paralyzed him. The fact that he's still going to the therapist gives me hope that they will resolve things next week...",

Guess it's also coz JaeWon is a people pleaser and tries to get along even with toxic people, but JiHyun being an introvert only opens up to people he feels comfortable with. JaeWon needs JiHyun more than JiHyun needs him.",

My sense after these episodes is that Ji Hyun would be okay without Jae Won in the long term and move on to a happy life after licking his wounds, but Jae Won needs him as the key to free himself from his mental jail.\n\nIf things were to stay exactly as they are right now, in 10 years I see Ji Hyun as a successful artist with a hot and nice boyfriend and Jae Won going to the opening of one of his shows with his stifling chaebol wife and reminiscing about the magical night they had together. Hope the writers give us some character growth for Jae Won.",

I'm sorry for what jaewon through but what he said and did to jihyun is unacceptable, using trauma as excuse for someone behaviour is big no no, we certainly cannot control for what coming to us, but certainly we could control our reaction to it. Sorry for anyone who didn't like my opinion, but i had enough in my experience handling and becoming someone else trauma punchbag so when i watched the show it's really hit me so hard.",

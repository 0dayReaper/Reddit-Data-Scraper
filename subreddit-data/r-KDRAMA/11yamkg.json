While he fights against a devil, he gets transferred to a different world. Pontifex Rembrary then finds himself in a small dormitory and possesses the body of Woo Yeon Woo, who is a member of the unpopular idol group Wild Animal.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;The group has been together for 3 years, but they are on the verge of disbanding due to their lack of success. 9 hours later, Pontifex Rembrary is placed on a stage with Wild Animal for a live performance at a broadcasting station. When the music begins to play, Pontifex Rembrary, in Woo Yeon Woo\u2019s body, shouts out, \"I don't know how to dance.\" The live broadcast performance is a disaster, but it attracts the attention of people and the media.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;With his charms, including a confident attitude, Woo Yeon Woo, still possessed by Pontifex Rembrary's spirit, becomes popular, and so does his group Wild Animal. Pontifex Rembrary must now get used to life as a member of an idol group, and he faces various troubles, like dealing with weird religious groups and the devil.\n\n* **Streaming Sources:** [TVING](https://tving.com/), [Viki](https://viki.com/), [Viu](https://viu.com/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behavior will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

I am continually impressed by how proactive Dal's character remains throughout the show. Love her head on approach and how quick witted she is. Can't wait for tommorrow's ep! I hate that it is the last one though! Would have been nice to see some more wild animal boys shennanigans where they aren't in a life or death situation! I hope that everything gets resolved cleanly and there are no loose ends.",

Also, maybe the Goddess is just a huge prick and the reason the Evil King is pissed of is because she did a bunch of bad shit and blamed him. !&lt;",

They basically compressed and dumped all of the information we've been missing in the final episode. I wanted to see at least one performance of Wild Animal, how the real Yeon Woo/Ardor destroyed Rembrary's realm, an in-depth backstory of how Redrin and the Evil One met, the mistake that Dal made that pushed Liz Ri to that situation, and Gam Jae's friendship with the female Grim Reaper. I wanted to see more of her and Gam Jae, but that storyline didn't go anywhere. There were so many subplots that needed further explanation. Overall, I still enjoyed this drama bc of Min Gue and Bo Gyeol, along with Rembrary's heartwarming relationship with Wild Animal. The comedic moments really made the show.",

Lowkey thought the Abrahamic God would step in since it took place in a church. Like why the heck a church? Also was she a seaweed nymph? What does her origin translate into?

Now before that she wasn't very powerful but the general belief regarding any deity's powers is that the more people believe in them, the more power they have, which is how her power grew and then she turned evil (I feel they used the idea of how power and greed and evil is related) and did whatever stuff she did.\r And the church confused me too. It was probably like a cover for hongwoodaedae because people would probably be more interested in a cult that worshipped deities belonging to their own realm?? IDK how cults work but I just feel it was for the cult thing!&lt;\n\nEdit: I deleted the previous comments because the spoiler tags weren't working.",

The actor did such a good job being both. \n\nAlso, although these two leads didn't have the crackling chemistry as the ML shared with his costar in Business Proposal, they did just fine. And sometimes, the way he looked at her would have my stomach would kind of float up into my chest and then settle when I reminded myself that it was acting. \n\nFinally, what a wonderful FL. She was consistently brave and unconditional in her love for him. He was the one with divine powers but she was the one who was always protecting and saving the day. She was physically smaller and absolutely ordinary by every definition. She even &gt;!gets forgotten and doesn't get the credit for her role in defeating Redrin,!&lt; but boy did she kick ass. \n\nI really look forward to seeing both of their works in the future because they both did a stellar job.

It suffered from not having enough episodes to expand on some of the interesting relationships including performances from the Wild Animals.\n\nThey could have lost the romance between the CEO and the vocal coach. I was utterly uninterested in either of them and it added zero to the plot.\n\nI thought the romance was okay.  It wasn't based on chemistry and wasn't meant to be.  Rather it was based on two people who grew to become deeply devoted to each other.  It didn't require all the usual tropes, and I didn't miss them.\n\nI know everyone complains about rushed endings, but I feel like too much happened all at once at the end.  The show kept us mostly in the dark and then revealed everything all at once.   \n\nI still enjoyed it, however.  The comedy was especially good and Kim Min Kyu was excellent in it.",

May be 14 episodes would be enough.\n\n\n&gt;!Redrin becoming a villain kinda dragged down the story. Its the finale, its supposed to close things up, but they just crammed in Redrin's story!&lt;\n\nRedrin's plan is all over the place too.\n\nSo &gt;!basically since she's not a deity, she has to kill Rembrary to get that part of her soul that she used in creating Rembrary. She seemed to be unaware that the deity powers is based off the ppl who trust the owner(based on her reaction at the chapel confrontation) yet she sent an \"alter ego\" to another realm so ppl can \"hate\" Rembrary. Honestly, even I got confused while typing this!&lt;\n\nI'm not sure if this is due to issues on the script or scheduling issues (I'm not sure if filming this overlapped with The Glory)\n\nI also didn't like the &gt;!Fake Yeon Woo plan of Redrin. But maybe I should've seen it since the series barely gave screen time to \"Yeon Woo\"!&lt;\n\n\nImo, this is one of kdramas that had an interesting synopsis that tumbled on the ending.\n\nEdit: added more words",

They were interesting, but I still don't get why &gt;!Redlin created the Pontifex so that she has to set the Evil One agaisnt him.!&lt;\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the show for it's silliness and it's cuteness. However, it had so much humour, good acting and interesting storyline that it could have been better put together.\n\nThey seemed to concentrate more on the light parts, which are very well done, but, imo, the emotional moments didn't land.  I mean Rembrary &gt;!was manipulated for 100 years and the Evil One killed so many people during the same period and all because of lies, but the viewer doesn't really feel the weight of this situation, at least I didn't.!&lt;\n\nIf they didn't want to make the final part too heavy, they could've done it the following way. They could've made The Evil One and Redlin bitter exs who constantly try to get back at each other. Neither of them would be \"Evil\" per se, but just a bunch narcissists with some powers and a blatant disregard for human lives (sort of like some Greek Gods). \n\nRedlin could've created a bad reputation for the Evil One, thus giving him than name, and made people hate him. The Evil One, in turn, could've been after the Pontifex to get back at Redlin.\n\nThe ending could've been them getting imprisoned together and understanding that they still love each other.\n\nThis storyline would've created a good twist, while setting a humourous situation, so they could've kept the same tone as the rest of the show.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the show and I'll miss it, but I still don't think that it lived to it's full potential.",

Have the Evil One drive the civilians to despair so that their faith towards her become even more intense. At the same time, she goes around selecting people with potential divinity seeds within them like Rembrary to grow so that she can harvest them for herself.\n\nI'm guessing that Redrin promised Evil One that she will share divinity with him to promote him into a diety so that they can be together forever after the Evil One farmed enough divinity for her \u2014 which she didn't honour.\n\nAlso, WYW is such a dick. Man should really die back then, screwing others life for his desire while Rembrary was working hard to better WYW's life on Earth. Seeing that Rembrary will come back to Earth in the preview, I hope they kick WYW back to the Otherworld. Good riddance.\n\nAlso, Jeongseo freaking out and slapping the Hongwoodaedae member out of reflex will never not be funny. I too didn't expect common sense to exist for someone to instantly report to police about a weird cult HAHAHAHAHAHA\n\n[Episode 12]\n\nI hope Gamjae never change. He is a precious boi ahahhaha\n\nWished they could have invested more time with the interaction between Wild Animal and Rembrary. Rembrary getting real pissed and beating the crap out of Ardor was fun to watch\n\nMan, if Earth Deity is Goddess of Afterlife, then Redrin is the Goddess of Gaslighting. Oh wait, she actually isn't a deity?\n\nWhile the show has been fun, I think I have to admit that somewhere along the way, the drama lost some of its charm. Anyway, its been a fun ride.",

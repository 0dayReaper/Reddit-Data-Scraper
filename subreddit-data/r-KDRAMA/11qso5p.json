    "postText": "Ever watch a drama where by the time the ending credits roll for the final episode, you start wishing you can get a refund for your time spent? \n\nIf so, come to this thread to [lament](https://i.redd.it/cjahtu0e77z41.gif) about that drama you wish [you'd never watched](https://i.redd.it/y79jjzsnygg31.gif)!\n\nThis post is different from the *Dramas I Have Dropped* post in that these should be dramas you finished watching and then regretted watching as opposed to having dropped the drama midway. Colloquially referred to as *hate watch*. This thread is envisioned for both the completists in our community who cannot drop dramas and dramas that go off the rails at the last minute.\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they regretted watching certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all. We can learn from each other and maybe even be convinced by others as to why a drama may have been worth watching after all.\n\nYou are not limited to Kdramas, feel free to discuss non-Kdramas or movies too. We strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "Strangers again: I love Kang Sora, I'll watch anything with her in it just because it's her, but man alive she makes poor picks sometimes. It took me years to forgive her for being in Doctor Stranger and then this drama happens. She was great in it, but I wish I had my 12 hours back.\n\nLove is for Suckers: omg soooo boring. The whole time I was thinking 'ah so this is why I don't watch reality shows..' The premise seemed so cool, Siwon and Dahee?? I'm in! But she was so wishy-washy, he really needed therapy, they weren't really a good match for each other. And that second FL cried WAY too much. I wanted to slap her a third of the drama in. \n\nLove In Contract: All of these actors were great in other projects. But put together, it was not cohesive, not fun, not even an enjoyable look into the struggles of the unmarried in modern day Seoul. He was supposed to be this stoic guy but turned out to be more like the comedian persona of the main actor than what was probably in the script. She was a shell of her previous roles all combined in one, and looked like she'd drop down from malnourishment at any moment. The other ML was an attempt at a tortured chaebol but ended up being so annoying. I wanted to know how all these characters would grow and overcome their fears/problems, but by the end nobody had changed at all. I'm getting annoyed all over just thinking about it. \n\nJinxed at First: I was so excited for this, he did an amazing job as the second ML in Mr. Queen, and I was so curious to see him smile more in a romcom, but man alive that was bad. The story started strong with the fantasy elements, but then it fizzles out and it gets lost trying to justify the bad actions and choices of everyone that made the main characters suffer. I could not understand why he ever liked her, and she is another case of 'this person needs therapy, not a BF/GF'. I not only regret wasting my time but I also wish I hadn't seen it.\n\nYoung Lady and Gentleman: this turned into a hate watch very early, and since I knew it was going to be long (51 episodes in the end I think?) I decided to continue with that mindset. I feel like I have PTSD from hearing her dad yell \"Dan Dan!\" I understand the whole being a single dad is hard part, but &gt;!he lied to this girl her entire life. She absolutely had the right to know the truth, and even when she started asking and questioning things he intervened and the consequences were so sad for her.!&lt; The mother in law was insane, and don't get me started on Sarah, she was unbelievable and it was even more unbelievable that ANYONE would believe her or that 'the President' would put up with her shit for any prolonged amount of time. Poor Dan Dan, I didn't know if I wanted to hug her and take her home with me to be my daughter or if I wanted to slap her silly and shake her until she grew a spine and absolutely destroyed that lady. I mean the things she had done to her, she should be canonized by episode 30 and ascended into heaven like the personification of patience and forgiveness by the end of the drama. Oh and don't get me started on the silly plots... Remember the Golden days where we'd play bingo with drama plots? It needed a memory loss bit, then a birth secret, maybe a sprinkle of cancer, then a smidgen of age gap romance.. Well, this drama would get you a bingo because it had EVERYTHING and a little more. I was flabbergasted by the end. I hadn't been this astonished since Baker King Kim Tak Gu, and that was in freaking 2010!!!!! I rest my case.\n\nEdited: some typos and spoilers",

The acting was amazing but I couldn\u2019t forgive them that.\nI\u2019m going to explain below in spoiler tags to earn off those who want to. I\u2019m still mad! \n\n &gt;! She found out her daughter was alive. A baby she thought she lost.  It was being raised by horrific enemy family. She found her, age 6 maybe, got to know her. And at the end of that so the beautiful sweet girl gets hit by a car and dies on the road for NO freaking reason. The start of next ep is the most guttural thing and honestly fine if you sell it as that I can avoid it. But to do that for NO reason like no plot reason just gross !&lt;",

They're tragicomic instead of melodramas like FOE, but they're all worth the watch.\n\n**W** gets makjang off the rails in the final 1/3, but it's a fast paced sci-fi/fantasy/action thriller that involves two parallel worlds.\n\n**Happiness** is light on romance compared to the others, but if you like zombies it's a great survival horror slice of life in a lockdown epidemic scenario.\n\nIf you're willing to watch Tdramas, **Someday or One Day** is a tightly plotted time loop thriller with a star crossed romance. It's being remade by Netflix as a Kdrama sometime this year.",

It\u2019s funny she usually tends to play very eccentric, quirky characters but it depends on the writing to make them either fun and memorable or terrible and bring the whole show down. Her character in Another Miss Oh was also awful and super annoying",

It\u2019s similar enough to the story in Boys Over Flowers and it also has Lee Min Ho with noteworthy hairstyles and fashion (those sweaters!!) but better acting all around (not great, but better).",

I'm not sure why that is but I am guessing a lot of it comes down to how much you care about cinematography, how much you like the type of humor this writer uses (I love it), and how much you relate to the main character (I hated her and can't relate to her at all, which made me drop this show on like episode 10 despite liking the rest of the writing and characters).   \n\n\nMost of the comments loving the show seemed to come from people who related to her and found the themes (wasted time commuting, unfulfilling job, loneliness, being cripplingly introverted, having no love for life or other people) poignant.",

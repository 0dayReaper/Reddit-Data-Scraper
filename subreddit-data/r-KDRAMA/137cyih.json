However, theres this nagging thought in my mind that she should be paired with more a-lister actors (no offense to rowoon, i love him). I thought after the success of Wooyoungwoo, she\u2019ll finally be paired with a-listers but no\u2026 she got paired with chae jong hyeop lol. again, no offense to chae jong hyeop but he feels like a total rookie next too park eun bin.",

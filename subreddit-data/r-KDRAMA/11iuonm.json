    "postText": "So I just finished Start Up after avoiding it for a long time. Netflix has recommended it to me consistently forever. I didn't know much about it but had unintentionally read many comments on other reddit posts complaining about the show. Nothing too specific but vague, offhand remarks like 'I still have trauma from Start Up', ' Thank god this didn't turn out like Start Up', etc. so unconsciously I assumed its just a bad show. I finally gave it a chance and OMG I LOVED it from Start to finish! Not just the show as a whole but loved the symbolism, the ost, lots of memorable scenes, acting of all the leads, chemistry between the ML and FL. I thought it was perfection apart from some minor things.\n\nAnd I discovered Nam Joo Hyuk, I have NEVER seen him in a show before (I've seen Suzy and Seonho though) and he was such a revelation!! I loved his character, the starting with the messy fringe hair Dosan all soft, nerdy, awkward, quiet, shy and lacking self esteem, then in the middle all frustrated even more insecure potentially going down the wrong path, then 3 years later, confident, comfortable in his own skin, mature, befitting a 30 year old Dosan. \n\nI just loved the show in general. The things below really stood out to me:\n\n1. The whole Sandbox journey, the creators showed it really well. It wasn't too high level or used as a vehicle purely for the love story. They provided us quite a bit of insight, the challenges to choose and form teams and then issues they face. I loved the way splitting of the shares went. The young kids, all naive and trying to be fair splitting it all equally until Jipyeong shows them the reality. It sucked but it was the truth. It remains one of the most memorable feedback from Jipyeong for me. Also loved how it was slowly revealed that Chulsan's so against Dalmi as a CEO/Major shareholder not because he still doesn't trust her but because of the hidden lies of the letters. I thought he was going to be the prick friend but i'm glad he was shown more practical.\n2. The strained relationship between Dalmi and Injae followed by the slow evolution. From Ep 1 it was clear their relationship will slowly change but there wasn't much change shown in the middle. Injae was starting to come across as too petty but I'm glad they didn't let the story go and shown us change in their relationship. I also liked how Dalmi ended up working for Injae showing she became really successful but not exactly 'taking over Injae'. That may have been a bit unrealistic given Injae had tons of experience by simply just watching her Step Dad. But by the end Dalmi was absolutely holding her own and given everyone has their own journey, there was no need to 'take over' one another. Besides Injae and mom ended up coming back to their original family pretty much proving that Dalmi's choice was never regretful.\n3. I really enjoyed the consistency of showing Dosan as a tech genius but not cut out for a CEO role. CEO MLs are romanticised by kdramas aplenty and I love me some of that. But realistically, not every genius can be a CEO and...that's okay. They are different skills. Like Jipyeong said, what excites you? You just need to know where your strength lies and plan your journey accordingly. CEO is not some pinnacle of success or endurance or brains. People like Dosan are crucial for innovation but you also need people like Dalmi or Injae, someone with a direction and vision. \n4. Dosan and Dalmi the way they complemented each other and also their growth. They both started off reckless. Dosan spending away his 20s over a start up instead of landing a well paying cushy job. Dosan with all the genius and technical skills but lacking direction. Dalmi, again reckless with dropping out of uni, bluffing against her sister. Emotional with her head in the clouds but having a clear vision of where she wants to be even if she doesn't know how. Both reckless who go through some pretty bad failures but come out as more cautious (Dalmi) and more resilient (Dosan). Best part though, they still remain just as starry eyed about tech innovation and do not become jaded. The almost kiss scene in episode 16 when they're in the office, Dalmi in her seat and Dosan asking her 'how far Tarzan can go?'. It's such a well executed scene, both not only want to continue technology to change the world for the better but actually turn each other on by talking tech, like how cute is that. This was one thing that remains the same since their first meeting. When Dosan explains AI to Dalmi and she finds him hella cool due to the nerd talk. \n5. Yongsan's brother's storyline. I was very worried that they will make this very dramatic and was expecting sabotage, etc. But they dealt with it really well. Of course Yongsan will want to blame someone. But of course its not Jipyeong's fault that his harsh criticism (expected in such a set up) ended up pushing someone over the edge. One minor thing though, Yongsan and Jipyeong's last scene lacked a bit of emotionalness/sensitiveness. Yongsan just had a smile and goes 'i needed someone to blame'. His words were fine but body language lacked something. For Jipyeong too, it would have been a huge blow to him to realise he impacted someone so negatively. He went through it too. But something about the scene made it too 'light', lacked tension. \n6. Jipyeong and Halmeoni - I don't think much needs to be said. Jipyeong truly found his family in Halmeoni and I'm glad they became a permanent fixture in each other's life. \n7. Jipyeong investing in the project around supporting older orphans in Ep 16. Throughout the show Jipyeong is shown very rational with a clear purpose, investing and supporting start ups with a clear growth strategy, He had no time for hopes and dreams unless they can bring value. That was also his job as an investor so makes sense. But there comes a time when you're plenty successful and can actually afford to invest in hopes and dreams. I'm glad Jipyeong was finally able to reach a point where he was ready to help people out, just because that's the right thing to do. He is not foolish to have investors invest but he can help personally. Initially he is never shown to be touched by any such cause driven projects, even when Halmeoni tells him to help others instead, his response is why others. Jipyeong who never received much kindness as an orphan, except Halmeoni, it makes sense that he feels he doesn't owe anybody anything for free and likely harbours resentment. Tech for tech sake doesn't excite him because he knows there's nothing free in this world. People are cruel. Life is tough. But this ending was a beautiful indication of him finally being on a path of healing from his past. \n8. When Dalmi tells Dosan she doesn't need a reason to like him, she just does, he is the reason. I thought that was such a beautiful culmination of all the angst, Dosan's insecurities. He thought she loved him due to his big hands (something she just said without much meaning) so he did all he could to become the romanticised version of Dosan she had in her head. But then she breaks up, Dosan's efforts were not enough. So the ending is just so beautiful, she loves him for who he is, not because he ticks off some list but simply because he is who he is. All Dosan ever wanted. I also think it was quite relatable in general. The childhood letters is very tropey but the underlying story is quite relatable. When young, as a teen its not uncommon to carry a list of romanticised things you want in a partner, things like sense of humour, intelligence, etc. come up often in high school. But then you grow up and usually fall in love with someone, just because. Not because they tick off items from a list but simply because they're who you connect with and are able to grow up with while still complimenting each other. \n9. The whole acquihiring debacle! God, it was so harsh but a real dose of reality for our leads. Also with so much baggage between them, they really needed a time out. Not only from the relationship but also just as friends. Dosan really needed to find his confidence, and one can only find that through their own efforts. He needed to realise his genius on his own. Dalmi also needed to get rid of her impostor syndrome on her own. She cannot just rely on genius coders who will listen to her because they love her. As a CEO, she will face many subordinates who will think they're better than her. She doesn't need to learn tech but she does need to learn how to manage such people, on her own and realise her worth and what she brings to the table. Loved how Jipyeong, a seasoned professional and investor just knew something was off. But our leads, bless their innocence, had no clue! But that's realistic. Shit happens. You cannot expect 20 somethings to know these things unless they've experienced it in some way. \n10. Dosan's mannerisms - I have no idea if Nam Joo Hyuk does the same mannerisms in other shows too but the ones in this really suited his character and got me smitten. At the start how his eyes are always looking down, the conscious breathing and lip quiver he did everytime he was on the verge of crying, awkward body language, the fist near his mouth everytime he was super focussed. Later when he comes back to Sandbox after 3 years, his confident but relaxed body language during the first meeting with Jipyeong, touching his neck in those scenes when they're talkig about going for Self driving pitch and he says how he took csats as a kid, when he teases Saha in earlier episodes LOLLL. Basically i LOVED ALL the mannerisms. So cute and hot at the same time! My kind of guy!\n\nSome minor things though - wish Saha got more meat to her role. All the other Samsan tech founders got more to do. I wish their Dad getting the funding he needed before dying was brought to light a bit more, especially in front of the mother. \n\nTLDR - LOVED THE SHOW but now need more Nam Joo Hyuk shows in my life. Except 2521, once again seen lot of comments talking about its sad ending and I'm not ready to sign up for that.",

I don't care much about the ending. I have rewatched the drama several times. I urge you to try it. And don't think about the ending. It was weird and unnecessary lol. I skip the last 2 eps when I rewatched because it added nothing to the show. The first 14 eps are in my top drama of all time list. NAM JOO HYUK IS A DREEEAM IN IT. I would drool every week. Just the way he acted through his eyes.. his dialogue delivery ahhhhh.",

I felt it had a happy ending but i still just felt so heavy and sentimental after so I want a break from something too heavy. Particularly, I'm quite busy at work and personal life, so best to avoid something that will get me too invested. I though start up will be fluff and mindless but its got me feeling too much. Hope you'll like it and not come out hating Dosan! I personally cannot at all imagine it but so many ppl misunderstood him so there's a chance your personal experiences may have an influence....",

Otherwise even i wouldn't try if someone said sad ending)  \n\nAnytime I see a post appreciating 25 21.. the comments are all people crying about the ending. It's sad really. It's a masterpiece of a drama. One of its kind. It got appreciated a lot before the last episode aired.",

When you have to wait for episodes and participate in on air discussions, you get super invested and build up potential theories and whatnot. I loved startup too and was also traumatized by 2521. However, I\u2019m sure the trauma for you won\u2019t be nearly as bad because you won\u2019t have time to build it up. 2521 is fantastic. However, if you need happy NJH, try weightlifting fairy Kim bok joo. Not on Netflix in the us though.",

It's been a while since I watched it, so not everything is still fresh in my mind, but memories came flooding back when I read your character analyses. Everything you said rang true and positively bristles with insight.\n\nThere were a number of factors that made it so special for me. Firstly, the opening episode could rival some movies in terms of its quality and impact. Secondly, I could relate to Do-san, Dal-mi, and Ji-pyeong all being underdogs in one sense or another in their respective situations, and this in turn made me desperately want them to succeed. Thirdly, the insights into the tech/start-up industry through the Sandbox concept were the primary hook for me throughout the entire series. Finally, the soundtrack complements the drama perfectly, and the music video for \"Future\" by Red Velvet encompasses everything I love about the drama.",

Also Nam Joohyuk\u2019s performance was great fr!! Like u said, he would always look at the floor and avoid eye contact but at the end u can tell hes really confident in himself by his mannerisms. Also I like the part where Dosan\u2019s father accepts his son as who is instead of always being so tough on him. When Dosan started crying while talking to his dad saying he feels like he always disappoints him, i also cried. Also the scene where Dalmi\u2019s grandma visits Jipyeong and tells him to contact her whenever he wants to and to stop being so lonely by himself, I also cried. I like how Dosan wasnt fit to be a CEO either. Breaking the male CEO stereotypes. Also like u said, I love how much Dalmi and Dosan complements each other. They are the perfect fit as partners AND business partners. Just amazing. I LOVE START UP!!! IT\u2019S MY FAVORITE KDRAMA AND I\u2019LL STAND BY IT.",

It really hit me in Ep 13. at 40:43 scene (first post time skip meeting of Jipyeong and Dosan) - Dosan's body language was so calm, collected, mature. Even when he realises the ring is for Dalmi, he doesn't let his emotions show and turns down the offer to go see Dalmi. He has accepted what went down with Dalmi and keeps the distance. The whole thing just shows how much he has grown not just in confidence in his abilities but also better grip at his emotions. \n\nYES Loved the evolution of his father and son relationship. Parents obviously worry for their kids and don't want them to waste their potential but all the pride just became a huge burden for Dosan because he was carrying guilt that he couldn't talk about. Asian/Indian parents and children in general don't always freely talk about our deep dark thoughts with our parents. We want to just show them our best but that means we're afraid to ask for help. And Dosan's father had a strong personality, obvious by the fact that he was leading the protests. The kind of domineering/intimidating personality where kids can be scared of him even if the dad never actually did anything wrong like beating him up. \n\nYes Jipyeong and Halmeoni scene made me so sad :(",

He loved and wanted her, yes, but what motivated him most was this desire to protect her and make her happy.  I felt that otherwise, he would have never pursued her.  The theme of self-sacrifice was present throughout.\n\n&gt;!I had not spoiled myself for this one, so fully expected that they would part and that made the entire drama very angsty for me.  I did not expect them to find a way to stay together.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!He was able to postpone his ascension so he could live by her side.

Same with Injae and Dalmi, you don\u2019t see Injae praise her often even later but it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s very proud of her. \n\nI initially felt for SML but he got satisfying closure in my books. He really needed to get over his childhood trauma and let go of that resentment. Even his last meeting with Dalmi, she says you\u2019re not avoiding me anymore and he goes, I guess I\u2019m a lot more resilient than I thought and how he never pursued her for 15 years despite reading the letters. He seems to have come to terms with it and will now be able to open up to future potential romantic interests. \n\nThe show ends with the notes of \u201cFollow your Dream\u201d and \u201cI want to change the world\u201d, the two main themes of the show throughout spearheaded by the two leads. There\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019ll become a huge power  couple in the future.",

I had seen him in Extraordinary You, Dol dol La si, Search WWW, Memories of Alhambra but after Alchemy of Souls I've REALLY appreciated him you know? \n\nSo yeah, getting smitten is hard because there's never enough shows to binge.

Someone shared that the wind and the swing were such powerful motifs in this show because they represented ambition and drive. Dosan had the talent but little ambition and Dalmi had the ambition but little technical knowledge. Together, they were able to have vision and the knowledge to achieve their goals. \n\n2) thank you for not jumping on the HJP wagon. So many assumed Dalmi and HJP would ship and were terribly disappointed when it didn\u2019t happen but it wouldn\u2019t make sense for their characters to get together. Dalmi was the visionary and HJP was the naysayer, the dream killer. If they shipped, HJP would\u2019ve dimmed Dalmi\u2019s light. \n\n3) 2521 is such a good show, you should watch it especially if youre a NJH fan. 2521 ending was bleh but it didn\u2019t really take away from how beautiful the story was. I\u2019ve watched kdramas for over 20 years and 2521 is one of the more unique stories that have stuck with me.",

Based off them, it seems to have been marketed as youth chasing their dreams. \n\nSo 1) makes so much sense! I said somewhere else that it\u2019s clear in future Dosan and Dalmi will be a huge power couple and make their company a unicorn! One thing that really drives this home is how both of them just look at each other with so much love when they talk about ambition. Like that almost kiss scene mentioned in my review, but also towards the end with the rainbow. There\u2019s scenes earlier on as well. It\u2019s what fuels them both and what they find attractive, \n\n2) Agree, his role just didn\u2019t go with Dalmi\u2019s character nor with the theme of the show. It did act as that balance you need though, dose of reality for the inexperienced kids. All of us inexperienced dreamers need that. One thing I found interesting though was that not only did he give feedback/criticism but he is consistently showed as someone who has no time for projects like that. Ideally if a project does something good in the world and has potential, as a mentor he can definitely HELP them come up/think about a profit model. If Jipyeong\u2019s character took that approach, I would be able to understand the shipping with Dalmi as you can make an argument for him balancing her out. But as the character stood, he never had any interest in exciting tech unless it generated revenue. They even make a point of it in episode 16 with the orphan project. And this drastically went against Dalmi\u2019s inherent nature. The other investors were not like that. The lady investor was particularly looking for a vision and Jipyeong\u2019s colleague with glasses, it\u2019s said that he routinely likes to support helpful projects. Alex was also able to see the potential behind Dosan\u2019s tech. \n\n3) I will be starting Weightlifing then watch 2521. A break from heavy stuff but I\u2019ve been convinced to give it a try.",

Seon-ho was fine in it too and played his character well but if you\u2019re someone who really gets bothered by actors/actresses playing the role then the show is probably not for you. For me, Seonho had a fitting good for his character in a show about youth chasing their dreams but for you as a fan, may come out with bad feelings because the ending wasn\u2019t focussed on him along with FL not being your cup of tea. Personally for me, if there\u2019s an actor I love playing a role and doesn\u2019t get the girl, it doesn\u2019t bother me too much. E.g Hyungsik in Hwarang.",

His personality was quite annoying and rude but because he was orphan people overlooked it. Dosan on the other was nice, humble, supportive and believed in dalmi more than anyone. He himself had insecurities with him being intelligent and skipping classes. Start up is in my top 5 kdrama of all time. Great story, everyoen finds their purpose and they make a great team.\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udee1",

                    "comment": "One thing I've observed in kpop spaces is that people create stories/scenarios as a prediction and then get upset if it doesn't play out that way. E.g if a kpop group announces an album, fans write long essays on what they expect to see and then get realllllly upset if songs/videos are not the same genre despite being very good. And these voices drown out the commenters who are satisfied. I see similar behaviour in kdrama threads too where ppl either start worrying or get excited for upcoming episodes and write about how they want XYZ to play out albeit to a lesser extent than kpop.\n\nSo keeping above behavioural phenomenon in mind, it makes sense that SML getting introduced first and with SO MUCH FOCUS made ppl have certain expectations. ML was introduced later but already had detailed interactions with FL for entire first half so ppl probably kept expecting it to switch at some point with focus going back to SML since he was focus in ep 1. When that didn't happen people probably felt cheated. But if you look at all the trailers and marketing, it was marketed as a drama about \"pursuing dreams\", \"sailing without a map\" \"a wrong encounter\" \"to get back into the race\" \"to shine again\", \"to repay your debt\". Its all about FL/ML's journey as individuals and together or side journeys like Halmeoni/jipyeon, Injae/step dad, 'Injae/Dalmi'. The focus was or point of the story was all about growth and future not the past.",

The first 4-5 episodes he was mildly irritating, but don't let that put you off. Lots of mention of 2521 as well. He was hot in there. If you think he was hot in Start Up, 2521 is even better. Regarding the ending for 2521, since you know about it already, watch it with this in mind. I don't think the ending was sad or unrealistic. THere were clues from episode 1 that this was the ending. 2521 is a poignant reminder of one's youth and first love.\n\nTHe other show not mentioned much here is The Light In Your Eyes. I think his acting really picked up here compared to the earlier shows, and the storyline is fantastic.\n\nNJH still has one more show coming out before he starts his military enlistment in mid-March. Until he returns thereafter, we will be doing plenty of rewatches.",

The song will give you a feel for the overall message/purpose of the drama.\n\nOverall domestic audiences weren't put off by the ending because of their familiarity with the song. I dare say that anyone who's familiar with the song had a pretty good inkling of what the ending was going to be like.  \n\nSometimes international audiences miss lots of language/cultural clues and \"riot\" from \"unexpected\" endings when the ending has clearly been hinted at.",

None of the characters lack, all did an amazing job, these includes the production, the editors, the cinematographer. Those school days, those sports practice, and the competition in big arena and the rivalry. Just because it has a sad ending which is why people suffer after its ends. I find some similarities of 2521 and startup endings, its not how people want it to end. But i do recommend strongly to watch 2521 to watch till atleast 14 episodes and left it as it is. Uptill there you will witness one of the best drama ever made. \n\nBtw starup was also a very good drama and loved it. People were conflicted coz of the two main leads and their desire to end the girl with whom they want them to be with. It was a blood bath here in discussion sub by the time it airs lol. People were divided into teams. It has good osts and as a Netflix drama the cinematography was on point too. Loved the drama.",

Cos he is able to make all roles so layered, that is why so many people were rooting for the 2ML as they could feel for him. \n\ndo San is very cute though! I think him being a genius made people feel more distant from him, and a little more unrelatable. But I felt that the show gave many clues that Ds would end up with dal mi.

I watched it while it was airing and the discourse around show w the whole team HJP and team Dosan situation was insane, I remember every week while the drama was airing their names would trend on twitter!\ud83d\ude05 I hated how toxic the discourse around the show got, that it sort of took away from the whole viewing experience. \ud83d\ude10 And once it ended it was sad to see people write the show off entirely because of the HJP situation, because the show was objectively not bad, it was light yet moving, it had a nice story, was well acted, beautiful chemistry between all the characters, beautiful OST and it was shot so well, overall it was such a treat. But people were too upset w the HJP storyline that they started leaving v negative reviews for the show, which I don\u2019t think it deserved. \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\n\nI was team Dalmi-Dosan through and through so I was very satisfied. The two of them being end game made perfect sense to me- finally she chose the person who showed up, who was physically by her side, who she spent time w and grew to like and so her reasoning for choosing him coz he was \u201chim\u201d(despite the history w her and HJP) also made sense. I know we tend to overly romanticize the first love/childhood love trope but in this context it didn\u2019t really make sense, maybe it\u2019s coz I\u2019ve grown up now, and I\u2019m older and wiser, I liked whoever she chose and for whatever reason she chose him, the reason being that they actually spent time together w each other and properly fell in love, as opposed to the childhood pen pal story, which was an idea of a person in her mind, someone she had never met irl.\n\nEdit: Just thought I\u2019d add some NJH drama recos.You should definitely watch Weightlifting fairy-it\u2019s v cute and it has a happy ending! \n2521 is reaaallly goood too, I know people were upset about the ending but the whole journey sort of makes it worth it?? The ending was v realistic, it was bittersweet and it made sense to me, and ik thats not what I want when I sign for a kdrama because I\u2019m only looking for an escape \ud83d\ude02, but u should def give it a go!",

Tbh 98% of the time I watch shows once they've already aired as I cannot wait weekly. I have a tendency to go to reddit threads to read comments as an 'outlet' when I binge watch and I think I disagree with comments atleast 50% of the time. It doesn't even have to be something big. I just feel like when people watch weekly, emotions run high and sometimes small things are made a big deal of and vice versa. So when I binge watch and go back to read comments, 50% are like ooo great insight and the other 50% are like...huh?? Particularly, negative characters or anything negative. Waiting weekly just makes you SO mad at them because you're waiting for their cumuppance and due to that heightened expectation, they may never deliver. Whereas binge watching, its easier to appreciate the full arc of a character. Anyway, I digress..\n\nI think I was hella confused after Episode 1 of the show because SML gets this whole arc in episode 1 so I was expecting him to be the main love interest but it felt very evident to me that NJH is the main lead as soon as he was introduced. And then it remains quite obvious until that time when Grandma asks which Dosan she likes more, and there's dramatic music and it cuts to SML and I'm like okay, maybe there is going to be a twist? So I can understand that people watching as it aired got confused. But even then she adds 'but the adult Dosan is sometimes different, and those diff attributes really make my heart flutter\" so you're like...its obviously endgame? Agree with everything you said, they really suited each other particularly with their growth in mind. Dalmi in particular starts off with her head in the clouds type of girl going through a tough time, its no surprise she held childhood Dosan so close to her heart for 15 years and never gave any guy a chance until real Dosan. She let her guard down to him and in the process obviously fell for him. It also made sense that she'll hold onto him for 3 more years given she held onto letters for 15. I fell for my husband in university as we both studied engineering, at a time I had no interest in dating, hadn't even thought about it. It just happened so Dalmi - Dosan falling for each other as they talk over AI (simplifying for lols) is like the most relatable thing ever. lol.",

That pilot episode is easily one of the best I\u2019ve seen in a kdrama, I loved how we spent all of the first episode getting to know the SML, only to be introduced to the actual ML in the last 2 mins of the episode!! I thought the approach was v intriguing and exciting! \nAlso Dosan had all the characteristics of a typical second male lead and compared to HJP he was the underdog- HJP had the solid backstory and childhood connection w the FL, he\u2019s the hot rich CEO, and in most kdramas it\u2019s usually the HJP archetype that finally gets the girl, so it was v refreshing to see how they flipped that trope on it\u2019s head!\ud83d\udcaf",

I saw some comments in the past of how Injae and Jipyeong should have gotten together as they'll be a power couple but that power couple fantasy was fulfilled for me by Dalmi + Dosan. Its obvious from the ending that they make an amazing team and will go on to become a HUGE force to be reckoned with. Its just that the show focussed on their journey to become that power couple, the trials and tribulations, mistakes made along the way. Both Dalmi and Dosan said how they do not regret any of their decisions even if they failed, its just learning along the way. Injae and Jipyeong also probably made mistakes along their way to success, we just meet them as already successful characters, older, more experienced but perhaps also more jaded (maybe not the right word but like less starry eyed). \n\nAlso just want to say, for people in Tech, its so easy for us to get carried away with the possibilities of technology innovation without realising the profit model aspect of it. Understanding the business side is usually a conscious effort or from experience at a workplace.  So all the mistakes made by the kids was very understandable and relatable. The way they all get so excited by Noongil and what it offers without realising how they'll profit off it. But slowly you know they're learning when Dalmi thinks of the medicine recognition module and how it'll increase user base and generate money. Tech people getting frustrated with the finance guys and vice versa in an organisation is like THE most common thing i've seen in all organisations I've worked with and same for my husband (an engineering + commerce background guy).

I never think twice about actors and realise their hotness until i fall for their character, case in point Dosan/NJH lol. Funnily enough for actresses I can definitely just appreciate their beauty separately from the characters. I see actresses/female idols all the time and think how stunning they are randomly lol.",

Its just something he does for Halmeoni. Even in adulthood, while there is a scene of him finding her cute/quirky and following her around, he isn't exactly interested until much later when feelings develop slowly but by then he's already a mentor which creates a power imbalance of sorts. Jipyeong acting on it while he's a mentor would be a grey area in terms of how appropriate it is. By the time he gets out of that 'mentor zone' she's already head over heels for Dosan and likely to hold on to it for a long time like she held onto her childhood letters/first love for 15 years.",

These were my thoughts exactly!\n\n I don\u2019t think the show in anyway was tryna confuse us w regards to who the ML was, right from the beginning w the letters, they made it clear that he wrote those letters on Halmeoni\u2019s insistence and all of what was written wasn\u2019t even entirely his words. Halmeoni and him got together and wrote most of the letters. And yes the letters were source of comfort to him at that time but once he left he had completely moved on from it, he went 15 years without even thinking about those letters or wondering about Dalmi. He started to realize his feelings for Dalmi only after Dosan and Dalmi meet and start developing feelings for each other. \n\nWhile watching I used to wonder why people always vilified Dosan and put HJP on a pedestal, he wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest person either. A lot of the blame for the catfish situation went only to Dosan but it was HJP who started the whole thing in the first place.\n\nAnd the biggest thing was how we never really saw any romantic chemistry between HJP and Dalmi as adults, so I could never buy into that ship. Which again made me wonder why people were so passionate about it. I get that HJP as a character was interesting and had depth but I could never ship him w the FL coz there were never any sparks there, we didn\u2019t see any hint of romance between the two.\nIdk I somehow cannot root for one sided love stories, it\u2019s only exciting when there\u2019s mutual interest! Like I\u2019ve never understood the \u201che deserves the girl\u201d sentiment when we don\u2019t see the girl show any sign of interest in the person \ud83d\ude2d(I\u2019m getting singles inferno flashbacks of the main love triangle\ud83e\udd72).\n\nI sort of still got why people were so upset and passionate about the love triangle/SML in a show like reply 1988, because we actually saw solid romantic chemistry between the FL and the SML and they properly start developing the ML and FL\u2019s story only quite a few episodes into the show, long after establishing that the SML likes the FL and she too had a crush on him. And so I sort of understand where people were coming from, and why they were upset, but I never truly understood it w start up!",

He was an orphan, kicked out of an orphanage with nowhere to go. But he has to pretend to be a 12 year old well off kid with parents in his letters. That would end up stopping him from being able to share his true emotions in the letters. It makes sense why the creators never went down the path of Dalmi feeling an unexplainable connection/familiarity with Jipyeong because what he wrote in his letters was definitely not his true self. Also makes sense why Jipyeong forgot about them, never felt a true connection Because he probably couldn\u2019t express his real thoughts.\n\nI think people tried to blame on Dosan because in their mind he actively liked her and still deceived her but that\u2019s bizarre because Jipyeong wanted Dosan to continue to charade even when he started developing feelings. Remember when Dalmi finds out partial truth in Sandbox and Jipyeong was so worried about what she thinks about him. So it\u2019s the same situation really. Besides bulk of the blame lies with Halmeoni who coerced kids into deception. But it makes sense why Dalmi would be most mad at Dosan, because she likes him and it\u2019s natural to freely express hurt/frustration to your partner the most. \n\nI think people felt annoyed that throughout the 3 years Dalmi and Jipyeong relationship hadn\u2019t progressed. But it makes sense for both 1) Dalmi is the type to hold on for a long time. She pauses Chulsan\u2019s YouTube videos and stares at Dosan for hours, girl is still hung up. Besides the break up wasn\u2019t clean, she has guilt as well so doubt she would have reciprocated even if Jipyeong made a move. 2) it\u2019s understandable for Jipyeong to hesitate, he can tell she\u2019s still in love with Dosan and a wrong move at a wrong time can not only push her away but make situations awkward when he finally has become a permanent fixture in Halemoni\u2019s life. But it makes sense to continue holding on because Dosan is not there so inevitable you\u2019ll think you have a chance one day when Dalmi is in a better place. \n\nOng I saw Reply 1988 only few weeks back and yup was soooo taken aback by who she ends up with but I also LOVEDDD it. Like you said though, there were actual scenes pointing out to their sexual tension and crush on each other from way before. So makes sense why people felt cheated. I personally would have been fine even if she ended up with Junghwan but also loved her with Taek! \n\nI\u2019m a big supporter of you love who you love in Tv shows. You don\u2019t love someone just because they\u2019re nicest to you and never do any wrong. You love who you love and not someone who ticks off the boxes. Even when when I feel INTENSE SL syndrome, 98% of the time it makes sense why FL has ended up with a ML. Because they\u2019re compatible with each other, not with me. lol FLs are not some trophy. I also dont understand when people  think SL came across pathetic just because he didn\u2019t land the girl. Imagine telling someone in real life that they\u2019re pathetic just because of unrequited love.",

The letters were not all  him or his feelings, he was merely playing a part and hence his lack of attachment w the letters or why there was no feeling of familiarity Dalmi felt w HJY when they met as adults. So the old Dosan was not really one person (he was neither the actual Dosan nor HJP), he was just a character they created, an idea of a person. \n\nAnd for the actual Dosan to come around and for Dalmi to choose him despite the past, and her picking him for himself was the perfect reason. I remember when the show was airing, people thought that was such a cop out reason and how Dalmi herself doesn\u2019t know why she likes Dosan. But that really was the best way for her to have put it!\n I suddenly have a stronger appreciation for the show, like they had the whole thing planned out and figured out so well from the start and it all came together so well but unfortunately it was misunderstood by a lot of people!\ud83e\udd72",

Dosan didn't return back to ruin Jipyeong's potential proposal. Even if Jipyeong went through with the ring, Dalmi either would have turned down or put him on hold since she was still crazy about Dosan, e.g. when she ran after the guy she thought was Dosan. Even if Dosan ended up returning later, they would have crossed paths due to what they specialise in AI/Self driving cars at some point and even common friend like Saha. \n\nThe creators made the show quite clear but didn't feed it to us on the plate and that seems to have confused a lot of people. Its a rare show to actually give a unique backstory about low self esteem but I think people couldn't relate. Which is odd imo because so many people suffer from impostor syndrome.",

I thought it was one of those shows that ended as strongly as it started. \n\nThe letters were hugely important to Dalmi and she was grateful to them. Thanks to the letters she had a romanticised vision of Dosan who did not exist. Dosan wasn\u2019t the letter Dosan but neither was Jipyeong, an 18 year old talking to a young 12 year old while pretending to be 12 himself. He was even helped by Halmeoni throughout the writing of the first letter as far as we know. Dalmi even thought it\u2019s a love letter and Jipyeong/Dosan loves her but Dosan never thought of her romantically when writing it (she was a kid I guess). \n\nHe barely even remembered the content 15 years later given he didn\u2019t remember that he really wanted to play Go Stop On his birthday but Dalmi did. The thing is he didn\u2019t just steal Dosan\u2019s name but actively was pretending like he\u2019s from a common family and is 12 years of age which means he probably had to leave out lot of his true emotions he was feeling at that time (he was orphan with nowhere to go and very downcast). \n\nSo the active lies by Jipyeong and Dosan eclipses and dilutes the importance of the letter imo. She\u2019s not going to feel the same that she did before besides the big question was that she had actually fallen in love. Real love in person. But she had no idea who that was anymore, Jipyeong or real Dosan. There was quite a lot of focus allocated to her confusion along with how she felt incredibly stupid for believing the letters. The final, final resolution comes in ep 16 when she has a chat with Jipyeong. He stops her though and speaks himself about how the letter comforted him too as he had no friends and to not thank him or feel sorry. Also that he never really looked for her despite reading the letters but Dosan did, indicating how moved Dosan was by the content. \n\nI thought the letters were resolved very beautifully. Dalmi just had a lot more serious things to sort out by the time letters were revealed aka her real feelings, her real heart and love story she was feeling in person followed by the 2STO mess and heartbreak.\n\nEdit - basically in short I wanted to say that the chat Dalmi had with Jipyeong in last episode for closure, that ideally should have come up earlier but unfortunately just way too many bigger problems had already happened by then. Dalmi was doing well career wise but she was quite down in the dumps about Dosan shown by her jsut pausing Chulsan\u2019s YouTube video and just watching Dosan. It makes sense why she wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the letters and all that in that state.\n\nEdit2 - kind of like in real life, you know when something bad happens to you and you\u2019re devastated but then something else even worse happens and you\u2019ve forgotten about the first bad thing. Eventually when things are looking better, you no more look at that first bad thing with same emotion as you did before. Same with if you see the letters as positive, it meant a lot to her but she didn\u2019t really have much going on for her. 3 years later, a LOT has already happened to Dalmi so the childhood letters are no more as big of a role in her life. She has even changed as a person.",

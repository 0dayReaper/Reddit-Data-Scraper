I was kinda thinking the plot made me think this would be like Rooftop Prince and the person from the past would be in the future (our present) and that's where the drama would mainly take place and if she's just part of the Lee Se Young's past it's not a very big role (unless there are flashbacks or its a Queen Inhyun's Man type back and forth return to the future/past)",

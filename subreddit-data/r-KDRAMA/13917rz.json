I think the writer was talking to both the characters and audience when they kept saying over and over - keep more distance between you and the subject or you will get hurt.  I think it hurt me expecially because I had a first love relationship that went GU (geographically undesireble - too far apart distance) We went our separate ways, I got married, he died of cancer in his late twenties. my big regret in not having that final, thank you for such a beautiful time in my life conversation and not a proper closure. After his death I was devastated, grief stricken. Then I had a vivid dream. So vivid it looked and sounded real. He said, \"you know I always loved you\" and I made a promise to him to let him rest in peace and not bother him with thoughts of regret. I met his mom years later (having lunch watching the Olympics - ha!) told her of my dream and she burst into tears as she knew how much he meant to me.  So I think my problem was overlaying my story over the story the drama was trying to tell, and it hit me hard.",

Those formative years of our lives where we have our childhood/teenage first loves are always the hardest to let go. Yeah i also got too deeply involved with Baek Ijin and Na Heedo initially and that ending was devastating as i thought they were acting out the story of my life. Im in my twenties now and that first love/ teenage crush phase has passed now for me and I could live with that ending as I know those early romances while they are the sweetest and most impactful relationships of our growing years, they tend to always fizzle and never work out. My first love is married with a kid now and I actually attended her wedding (and managed to say congrats to her like Baek Ijin said to Na Heedo \ud83d\ude05 but without the constipated face trying to hold back tears)",

It blends newly arrived  street cars and trains with Joesen attire, culture and customs.  Mr Sunshine is an adopted korean by an American who then returns as an adult as an army major in Korea and ends up helping the resistance. He falls in love with a leader of the resistance, played by Kim Tae-Re as part of that journey.  His contributions are recognized in Korea to this day. \n\nAnother excellent and moving drama about this period is The Last Princess staring Son Ye-jin which is on Netflix. \n\nLastly, Pachinko on Apple TV details the horror of the eventual Japanese occupation of Korea.",

Plus he\u2019s hanging out with the baddies, like the construction tycoon dude and the congress woman, so clearly he has to be in cahoots with them. !&lt; \n\nI know, wild theory lmao. Watch it be &gt;! Jin Muk !&lt; all along and the next 8 episodes are just the legal proceedings of how he\u2019s booked for the murders.",

Sadly I didn\u2019t like suspicious partner as much and gave up on lovestruck in the city in the first episode itself. Had read some reviews of healer on this sub itself so gave it a chance and enjoyed it so much. Even though it features a lot of the cliched tropes, it was still a good drama, very heartfelt. PMY is super cute, JCW is of course amazing but what caught me by surprise was moon ho\u2019s character \ud83d\udc40 he\u2019s so dreamy n charismatic, I\u2019ve never seen the actors work before but wow! Also the drama has some beautiful kisses.. but i mean who\u2019s surprised? It\u2019s jcw and pmy.. but it was still unexpected since it was released almost a decade ago xD Watch out for some creepy villains tho. Loved the dynamic bw jcw and ajhumma. What was uncool was the last ep, with just 10 mins left the plot was all over the place even tho each ep is 1 hr +. Sigh, the ending was okay but the execution was absolutely terrible. Anyway I\u2019ll still rate this drama a 7.5/10 and i do recommend it!",

The thing is the characters are messy, imperfect and realistic which I've come to find I love but tends to lead to more controversial shows because you can't as easily root for someone wholesale. If you're okay with that then go for it, it's a great drama! If you prefer your characters to fall into good/bad categories it may not be for you.\n\nhope this makes sense, if you have any questions let me know!",

She soon finds out she needs to get an operation that will render her infertile within 6 months and the drama unfolds as she tries to get a willing partner/donor to have her dreams come true. Again, this is how it started and at first it was actually relatively enjoyable to watch however past the 6-7 episode mark it devolved into how can we add as much filler to the story to make this a 16 episode drama that will then ruin every avenue of enjoyment from the watcher.  \n  \n&gt;!Every love interest built up over the story is not only ruined but left alone, her company shuts down the children magazine she's spent over a decade working on and they don't even mention having a kid until the last 10 seconds of the show's epilogue!&lt;\n\nTl;dr: The show is a 4/10. Drags on too long and loses its charm less than half way through its 16 episode length. I really wanted to give it at least a 5/10 because the actors did an ok job with what they had but that would imply I felt indifferent towards it while I legitimately felt like I was just burning time on this.",

It was also fascinating to see their reaction to MERS which was so familiar remembering early Covid. And it's exciting with life and death hanging in the balance every episode, along with all their personal drama!",

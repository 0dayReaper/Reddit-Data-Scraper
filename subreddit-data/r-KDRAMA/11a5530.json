    "postText": "I've seen over 125 kdramas. When I begin a drama, especially one that has been highly recommended on this  subreddit, I often know after the first 2 episodes whether this is something that I will stick with, even through those 1 or 2 boring episodes, slow-moving plots,  or even if the subplot or 2nd leads are cheesy. So what's that subtle element that makes me stick to a drama? Here's how it is for me:\n\n1. Engaging characters, with at least one or two who I really like and admire:  If I'm not intrigued and happy about the characters (or actors portraying them) I'm outta there. I want to know, even from the first episode, that the main protagonist has a sense of integrity. I understand that the antagonist or second lead might not, especially in the beginning, because there needs to be room for growth, but I want to see that there will be some redeeming qualities that will lift me up. So show me that at least one of the main leads has compassion and a sense of justice and I'm in.\n2. Good, engaging actors. If I don't enjoy watching the actors onscreen, then I usually drop the drama. I'm watching a kdrama because I want to enjoy the visuals, the emotion, the acting! If that's not there for me, I don't continue. Is this superficial? Maybe so. They don't have to have the highest standard of Korean beauty. (although that helps, tbh), but they need to be interesting and have enough stage charisma to command the camera. There's a reason actors like Ji Chang Wook, Lee Min Ho, Park Seo Joon, Park Bo Gum, Kim Soo Hyun, etc. are top rated. They're experienced and know how to relax and emote. Actresses like Park Eun Bin, Han Hyo Joo, Kim Mi Kyung, Suzy, Ha Ji Won, for example also know how to command the screen.\n3. Engaging, unique plot. Kdramas are full of predictable tropes, but an interesting setting and a few twists will keep me engaged. The execution of a predictable trope is important. A cat who turns into a beautiful human (L)? A god trapped on earth?  Mistaken or switched identities? All these have been done before (maybe not the cat....) but there needs to be something unique and interesting to keep me engaged. And I need to see a bit of it in the first episode.\n4. Music. As a musician, the music is important to me. It's not the \"make it or break it\" element, but it is important to my enjoyment.\n5. Some promise of deeper meaning. Too much silliness is a turn-off to me. Too much toilet and low-humor doesn't sit well with me, although Shopaholic Louis was completely enjoyable. I want a good underlying theme. That's just me....\n6. Finally, I love a really good romance. I want to see who the leads are and imagine if they will get together in a satisfying relationship. I can enjoy some dramas without romance, but personally I really like that element in my dramas.\n\nThere are more, but these are the most important for me.\n\nWhat are your \"must-haves\" to keep you watching a drama?",

            "comment": "Hmmm, I think that there are several purposes of entertainment: \n\nFirst, as human beings we have a limited set of experiences. Any type of art can help us view the world through a different lens, the one of the artist. This type of entertainment can engage can viewer emotionally, widen their scope and make them ask questions. The k-dramas that go in this category are such as **Move to Heaven**, **My Liberation Notes** and **Extraordinary Attorney Woo**. \n\nSecond, the enternainment might have an engaging story. This are the shows that keep you guessing. They makes the viewer crave to know what happens next and how it all ends. Such k-dramas include **Mouse**, **Blind**, **The Weak Hero** and\u00a0 **Happiness**. \n\nThird, the entertainment might make you connect with a character and make you live their adventure with them. For this category I would put **Crash Landing on You**, **One the Woman** and **Mr. Queen**. \n\nLast but not the least, the final category are the show that make you feel better. Ok, this is personal for every individual and these are the type of shows that are often put down because they don't have to have any substance. However, they accomplish a very important task. If you are tired or you don't feel well, then you put a show on and it relaxes you or uplifts your spirits, you are not wasting your time. Far from it. For me, in the k-drama department, it would include something like **I'm Not a Robot** or **Perfume**. \n\nOf coarse, all of the above are not mutually exclusive. A show can touch you in multiple ways. \n\nHowever, now I can easily say what kind of shows I will consider a waste of time. These are the shows that are not thought-provoking or emotionally engaging, that I don't care how they end, that I can't connect with the characters and, aside from all of that, don't make me feel good.",

If they're done realistically, they feel human. They feel relatable. If not, they're entertaining yet still have emotional depth. Yes, not every drama is this way, but in general, the attachment to the characters or the plot get to me and keep me watching.",

                    "comment": "I agree with this a lot. One of the biggest reasons I love kdramas is an emphasis on emotions, and all kinds of emotions as well. We see characters range from giddy, shy, heartbroken, angry, scared, happy, in love, depressed, brave, determined, etc. And I feel like all emotions are treated with the same level of respect and recognition. It isn't unusual to see a man cry or giggle over being in love, or a woman to feel anger and want revenge. All emotions are valued and expressed. So when a drama does a really good job of touching me emotionally and making me care about the characters and their journey I get highly invested, even if the plot is only so/so.\n\nI also feel like because of the focus on emotions, the payoff is greater. For example, a kiss between two characters has so much build up with longing glances, the brushing of hands, stumbling into one another, that when the kiss finally happens I FEEL it so much more. Or if it is a revenge plot we've gone through all the struggle and heartbreak and failures along with the character so when they finally achieve their goal you can FEEL how satisfying it is.\n\nI really appreciate how well emotions are handled in kdramas.",

Am I need of the intensity of Vincenzo\u2019s later episodes, or the softer Do You Like Brahms, some uncomplicated tropey comedy courtesy of Business Proposal, or strong female leads going from broke to getting things done like Into The Ring or Romance is A Bonus Book? For me, it varies depending on my mood and energy levels.\n\nI also find that no matter how strong or weak the plot, I have to like the energy and dynamics between the characters and their relationships, not just romantic. The banter between the hacker and the healer in The Healer helped me through early episodes, the main friendships and familial dynamics in Business Proposal, the strong ensemble in Hometown Cha Cha Cha, etc. I also have to have characters I find interesting to watch and root for, like Chi Cho Yeol (sp?) in Crash Course, Woo Young Woo in Attorney Woo, Vincenzo, etc.\n\nThere also needs to be something driving the plot. I\u2019ve only rarely enjoyed slice of life (like HCC) but mostly I need a central compelling plot to be resolved, even if it\u2019s only the romance.\n\nI will also keep going beyond a weak episode or two if I\u2019m told by people that it improves by a specific early episode. I probably wouldn\u2019t have continued Vincenzo without that. But it has to be an early episode, I\u2019m not going in 6 episodes deep for it to improve.",

One thing that has made me drop a drama is when the characters act badly and they are somehow justified in the show. For instance, I know many people love the show, but I had to drop My Lovely Sam Soon after episode 7 when the ML slapped the ex-girlfriend across the face when he found out why she left him. I found it outrageous and unacceptable and somehow the show treats it like nothing bad happened. I just cannot continue watching or rooting for a character like that.",

Nothing makes me drop a drama quicker than an obvious shift(s) in tone or a drama that does not establish a consistent tone.",

So show me that at least one of the main leads has compassion and a sense of justice and I'm in.\n\nI find villains can be just as - if not MORE - engaging than morally good protagonists. I don't need or *want* everything to be uplifting or wholesome or full of positive messaging.  To me a fully consistent cruel/manipulative/evil character can be the most captivating. I don't have to *agree* with the character's motivations - I just need to *understand* why they are doing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Good, engaging actors. If I don't enjoy watching the actors onscreen, then I usually drop the drama. ... but they need to be interesting and have enough stage charisma to command the camera. \n\nI agree with this. However, I feel like this is highly subjective. Even if I really really like 99% of the principal cast, I have absolutely refuse to watch certain dramas if one of the main cast is X Y or Z. It's not that they aren't charismatic or can't portray certain emotions - I just detest their *style* of communicating \"sad\" \"intense\" \"charming\" etc etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Engaging, unique plot ... but there needs to be something unique and interesting to keep me engaged\n\npersonally, I think uniqueness and novelty is overrated. There's nothing *novel* about chocolate cake but sometimes a well made chocolate cake is exactly what the situation calls for. I can't count how many locked room murder mysteries I have read/watched, but I love it every. single. time. I firmly believe that sometimes submitting to format and just watching for execution leads to the some of the best watching experiences.",

What keeps me going is how the story is told. I have to anticipate the next episode and it shouldn't be predictable and even if it is predictable then let the characters be interesting. \n\nSometimes the plot is great but how the writer chooses to tell the story is what makes or breaks a drama. Also, the director plays a vital role in setting the tone for the drama, that too is important.\n\nFor reference, I absolutely love Crash Course In Romance but the storytelling is weak, had it not been for the chemistry between the leads and cast, as well as the phenomenal acting, the shoe wouldn't be as great as it is. \n\nI also loved the plot for Love In Contract last year. I was so excited before it aired. I didn't like the execution though and if it wasn't for Jung Jiho's fantastic acting, it would've fallen flat.",

There are dramas I fall in love immediately (Alchemy of Souls) or they just hit the right spot at that moment for whatever reason (Wok of Love).\n\n I think for me historically it's been whether I'm drawn to the actor. And now, after 4 years of watching, that I know more actors, I find that their prior appeal to me can carry me through shows I wouldn't watch otherwise (Seo In-guk in Minamdang, for example). I watch mostly for characters, I think. Also I like the repetition/predictability in romances. I have a lot of tolerance for story &amp; I'm not one of those that thinks a lot about plot holes, where the story 'should go', endings, etc. I just go along for the most part (although there are some shows I can't, like Jinxed At First (hated it from the beginning) &amp; the end of Do Do La La....). \n\nGuess I'm inconsistent. So I always give things a chance because I never know myself. For instance, recently watched the 1st episode of Hate to Love You and didn't like it at all. Watched the 2nd episode, completely hooked. Yoo Teo was a revelation, I believe he'll be an A list/international phenom. Never heard of him before this, and now I'm completely enamored by his acting, charisma, presence, and looks. Loved the story, loved the actors, loved the ride. \n\nI'm a bit envious of you all that have given such precise and thoughtful answers to this question. I continue to confuse myself!",

Those two pretty much wrecked me emotionally and I've rewatched them A LOT. They set the bar pretty high.\n\nSince then I've loved Attorney Woo, Her Private Life, Our Beloved Summer, AOS, Crash Course in Romance, and dropped maybe a half dozen more. Romance is my favorite genre.\n\nI think my main reason for sticking with a romance is it gives me something I don't get from US TV shows -- a slow burn love story that grows based on mutual respect; a ML who isn't a big dumb adolescent needing to grow up (and a FL whose only role seems to be to turn him into an adult); MLs and FLs who are considerate of others and have lives of their own that don't get dropped once the romance starts; FLs who have distinct personalities/values that don't disappear once they meet the ML; and especially men who are not embarrassed about so-called feminine characteristics, like crying or even liking something cute/adorable (thinking of Director Ji and his llama keychain). I LOVE scenes when the ML or FL sees the other doing something good and so obviously admires the hell out of it. I also love a great supporting cast and soundtrack. And of course there has to be a good story that you can look forward to being revealed.\n\nI've grown so tired of all the dark/anti-hero/screwed up characters in most US TV shows, and (probably because there's never a guarantee of a next season) how everything has to move so fast that you rarely get to relish the slow reveal of a who a person is and why they act how they do, and the too-basic predictable storylines.\n\nThe K-dramas I've dropped have all been pretty good but either the story is tooo slow (Run-on comes to mind), the necessary steady romance dopamine drip is missing, or the story is too weak, or one of the characters just rubs me the wrong way.",

We've only ever dropped 3 dramas and never after the 3rd.\n\nIt's hard to answer this without focusing on the negatives that make us not want to watch, because that's obvious, but the OP had some good points.\n\n* Good and engaging actors in the main roles. I don't want to see inexperienced actors in main roles just because they're tall or pretty, or have backing because of their Idol status. Two of my favorite shows that became favorites primarily because of the acting are *Dear My Friends* and *Our Blues*. These shows didn't have a plot or description that drew me in, but the performances alone had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning.\n* Dramas that recognize that their viewers have a brain. I don't want to see a lot of silliness for the sake of silliness. Well-done lighthearted comedy is fine but I hate it when a buffoon-type character is inserted just for laughs. Because it most likely won't make me laugh.\n* A plot that doesn't get bogged down or go astray. Of course this will most often happen later on once I've committed. There are times when I've wanted to quit a drama further into it, like with *Something in the Rain,* but once I've invested a lot of time, I just have to keep going.\n* The first 2-3 episodes have to have *something* that I find engaging since that's when I make my decision. Even if there's something a little bit intriguing, I'll most likely keep going. But it can't be so confusing that I have no idea what's going on.",

It kinda feels like you're living the story alongside the cast, instead of just calling shots on when something's gonna happen (like how the Truck of Doom is always at the 2nd to last ep lol)",

I like when their actions make sense, they are not based on pure emotions. \n\nMy favourite one is Stranger and it seems to touch on all things important for me: independent leads but with strong (platonic or not) chemistry with a promise that there's someone who can understand even the loneliest person, actions that make sense and a sensible plot that is well explained. Not a lot of repeated scenes. A bit of action but mostly strong dialogue.",

I mostly watch dramas after work because that's the only time available for me so I am very choosy on what to watch. If an episode made me want to fast forward or made me want to pause and do other stuff and yes made me sleepy I would drop it. Happened with Why Her at ep 11 or 12 I think? I am sad because I liked the first few episodes but I just don't want to waste my time on something I don't fully enjoy.",

It doesn't matter if it is poorly executed, if it has a really engaging story I watch it, even if it bores me, I try to finish just to know how it ends.\n\nI also enjoy a good romance, and good chemistry, even when I cringe at the really cheesy lines. But then again it all comes down to the plotline, I guess, if it's a good story I stick to it. It's a bit hard to explain what I mean by a 'good plotline', so don't ask me that.\n\nI also try to finish all the drama I start, even if it's really really boring and I hate it, I try to finish it because I don't like leaving a drama halfway through (there are dramas that took me over a year to finish, I finish it for the sake of finishing it).",

I thought it had both a phenomenal cast and script. Oh Jung-se played his character with a touch of genius.\n\nThat being said, I don't like too many pensive moments in romantic dramas, comedies etc. I've come across some where there are too many moments like that and it gets a bit much to the point where it can ruin the whole vibe.",

It couldn\u2019t hold my interest. I think the show has to be visually appealing or unique in someway too. The Devil Judge had a very basic look to it, where as shows like Glory, all of us are dead even sky castle, and Iteawo Class look so dynamic and stunning. The cinematography and color grading is beautiful enough to get you hooked.",

Good writing and good acting is okay, but may turn out bland without good directing. While, average acting can turn out good when the writing and direction is really good! (like how rising actors become more well known when they work with established directors). As someone who\u2019s also new to the Korean culture and grew up mostly with Western series, I find myself drawing towards to kdramas with a more Western ~feel~ to it. \n\nBut overall **mood** is a huge part of it. I notice that I need something more engaging when I\u2019m stressed, to get my mind off things. And I mostly watch simpler romcoms as a palate cleanser, otherwise I\u2019d end up dropping it. \n\nThere are also kdramas that I know I\u2019m going to love just within 5 minutes of watching it. Usually it\u2019s something that just clicks to me on a personal level\u2014 either I relate to the characters, or there\u2019s some familiarity to the situation, etc.",

            "comment": "I've almost broken 100 dramas, and I think you really nailed it with the first two elements.\n\n1. I can tolerate a good bit of cheesiness and tropiness, but **I need to be engaged with the characters.** They need to be nuanced, and have some believable imperfections and bad habits.\n2. **I need an engaging/convincing/nuanced style of directing.** I've learned to appreciate producing/directing and how much that affects the quality of the scene and the range demanded from an actor/actress. That being said, I do still need to enjoy the actor. Certain actors/actresses don't seem to pick projects/characters I care for... for ex. I've never been able to finish a Park Seo-joon show.\n3. **The dialog needs to be a good mix of meaningful and entertaining.** Predictable dialog and stock characters (the power hungry CEO, the evil Queen Mother) turn me off.\n4. The actions the characters take need to be believable. **If they're acting out of character in order to over complicate things--this strikes me as a cover for poor plot** and weak conflict driving it forward. (Examples of this, for me, include *Model Family* and *Bossam*). Give them something to really fight for!\n5. Set and setting. Cinematography, outfits, city, countryside, palace, big family, single jobseeker... All the little details that set the stage. When it's extra well done--it adds to, not just the overall tone, but the underlying messages and themes. It's not make or break, but I'll hang in there longer and believe in a show more that has a cohesive theme.",

Teenage/college themes and settings don't really do it for me anymore as I've gotten older. Meandering slice of life usually bores me. I want a story with things happening at a quick pace. Likewise, if a story seems like it's just spinning for 3,4 episodes with no progression in the conflict, i usually drop it. \n\nSo, I'd summarize it with theme's aligning with my interests and pacing that makes it feel like there's a real story without empty filler or meaningless sideplots.",

Theme: dramas which are like my absolute favs definitely have a theme or deeper meaning for eg vincenzo, MLN \n2. characters which I can relate or even if I can't relate they should be likable and charcter growth is also important like all char from MLN- loved them!\n3. intriguing plot/setting- I'm actually a sucker for fantasy and I was hooked with alchemy of souls coz it had an amazing world building! w-two worlds. \n4. some of the fantasies that failed to keep me hooked- tomorrow( maybe coz it was not unique, it gave me del luna vibes and felt like a copy of it) same with mystic pop up bar\n5. sense of humor- I like dramas that are funny even if the plot is just okay I would still watch it for the humor \n6. cinematography- couldnt watch BOF for this reason\n7. I'm lenient with romcom as long as they r not cringey, tropey and nonsense- like cindrella nd four knights, clean with passion, oh my venus.\n8.  as for other genres like action- not a fan of action nd definitely not an easy watch and there aren't much action dramas but absolutely loved vagabond.

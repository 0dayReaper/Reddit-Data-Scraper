Not popular by any stretch of the imagination, Dae Yeol\u2019s only real joy comes from his time spent with the archery club. A talented archer whose skills have earned him a scholarship to the school, Dae Yeol doesn\u2019t mind being an outsider, so long as he\u2019s free to pursue his greatest passion. But an ill-timed run-in with a devilishly handsome classmate lands him in trouble and places his precious scholarship in jeopardy.  One of the school\u2019s most popular students, Jo Tae Hyun has always enjoyed a level of freedom that very few high school students have ever attained. Able to get away with practically anything, the entire school has no problem believing his side of the story when he\u2019s caught fooling around in the nurse\u2019s office with another student and Da Yeol. Claiming  Da Yeol was trying to make out with him, Tae Hyun thoughtlessly puts the archer\u2019s scholarship at risk. Desperate to correct the misunderstanding, Da Yeol does everything he can to try to quell the rumours but no matter how hard he tries, it\u2019s just not enough. Completely unremorseful about what he\u2019s done, Tae Hyun seems to take a wicked sort of delight in doing everything he can to make Da Yeol\u2019s life miserable;  his favorite method being to follow Da Yeol everywhere. Unable to shake  Tae Hyun, Da Yeol spends his days loathing his shadow but the more time he spends with him, the more conflicted his feelings become; leaving him to wonder, where exactly does the line between hate and love end?

Tae Hyun is too jaded for his age and Da Yeol's simplicity seems to work like a balm on his psyche. Their chemistry is \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb  I can't look away when they are together on screen. \n\nTomorrow's preview looks intense! I look forward to seeing Tae Hyun finally get the emotional support he desperately wants (and deserves).",

To think he gave the same two toffees to Da Yeol that his mother gave to him on their first meeting \ud83e\udd7a If that's not a love confession, I don't know what is!\n\nThe energy of youth, the optimism of teenage came across so strongly today. You are suicidal and then you see concern in your crush's eyes - and life is rosy again! That he told Da Yeol about his childhood is a huge deal and I think Da Yeal understood that. He too has moved away from his obsession with archery coz he has another precious thing in his life now. Their feelings are so delicate and they are both such vulnerable kids, I can't help but feel like a concerned mother. Please be good to them Show! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

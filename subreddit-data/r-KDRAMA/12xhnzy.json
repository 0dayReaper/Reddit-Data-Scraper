            "comment": "I really wonder if the rating of ENA will pick up one day. They always hover around 1%. It seems unfair as a lot of their shows are pretty good. For example, I enjoyed that the last 2 episodes of **Bo Ra! Deborah** quite a bit (they were funny and touching all at the same time), so it is odd for them not even reaching 1% viewership.",

Given that the show also became extremely popular on Netflix should show that its popularity was earned. In contrast, Bo Ra's plot although somewhat new isn't that unique, and with Dr. Cha already dealing with the independent woman who faced a cheating plotline, it's obvious which one is coming out as the winner despite airing on different days.",

Like they seem to have the dynamics of friends helping each other out rather than any one of them secretly/openly harbouring feelings for each other in this 'fake marriage' situation. So I am looking forward to how this dynamic eventually(hopefully) changes in the upcoming episodes.\n\nSecondly, the history between Tae Kyung and Se Jin seems to have a deeper and more darker backstory than what they have let on fron the bits of flashbacks they have shown us. We know Tae Kyung used to fancy Se Jin but now he despises her. What led to that other than a rejection when they were teens? Gotta be more to that. And also what is Se Jin's endgame to rejecting Tae Kyung initially and now wanting to marry into his family? Im pretty sure theres another valid reason other than wanting wealth or following the grandma's orders. Wanting to know more about their history and story has got me hooked.\n\nLastly, the side characters like Taekyung's sisters and brother and their partners seem to provide ample secondary-stories to keep us entertained throughout. Im also fascinated with the parallels between Tae Kyung's mum situation and Yeon Doo's where the kid isnt related to the dad. So hopefully when the mum and dad finds out about the lies, she would have some sort of empathy as it almost mimics their situation.",

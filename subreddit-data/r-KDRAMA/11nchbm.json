    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nWe have received a notification from one of our users about an account privately contacting them under the guise of friendship and discussing Kdramas but quickly turning that conversation NSFW, ending with verbal abuse and harassment when the user tried to disengage. \n\nWhile, as we all know, trolls abound on the internet, this particular incident brings to mind a persistent scam that has targeted the r/kpop community for years. See [2018 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/90u3du/has_anyone_else_gotten_this_weird_private_message/), [2019 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cglntp/warning_messaging_scam_targeting_kpop_fans_via/), and [2020 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/fv93ax/warning_the_reddit_kpop_pm_scam_is_back_again/) in r/kpop for historical context.   \n\nUnfortunately all we can do as mods is to ban these users, preventing them from posting and commenting in our community **when we are notified of the relevant accounts**. However they can still see and target members of our community who have their PMs and chats open because we cannot block them from reading our community.\n\nTherefore, we want everyone to be careful of any unsolicited messages, especially from accounts you have not interacted with very often in our community. \n\nPlease note that the accounts are not necessarily new accounts or 'blank' aged accounts, they can be accounts that seemingly have relevant comment history because it's easy enough to fake participation by copy and pasting comments or making low effort comments and posts.\n\n###What to do if this happens to you \n\n* Take a screenshot if possible then immediately report them to Reddit admins via the report button (or [via this form](https://www.reddit.com/report)). After you have done this [block the user following these instructions](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/messages-pms-inboxes/blocking-unwanted-contact).\n\n* If you have screenshots, we would appreciate it if you send them into Modmail so that we are alerted of the account and can ban them, which prevents them from building up participation history in our subreddit (which hopefully makes them look less credible to cautious users that check their history).\n\n###Precautions You Can Take\n\n* Do not respond to any unsolicited private/direct messages or chats. You can [opt-out of chat](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043470591-Can-I-opt-out-of-chat-) as a precaution.\n\n* Stop responding and block if a conversation makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\n* If you are feeling cautious about a user, you can browse a user's profile and post history before engaging with them and keep your interactions 'public' by engaging via commenting on posts (such as On-Airs or FFAs). \n\nStay safe online everyone!",

Maybe they thought people who like Kdrama (and/or Kpop) would be easier to prey somehow? There are so many other subs for them to find willing people to do their nsfw stuff with, I just don't understand why they'd want to make more effort by pretending to like Kdrama to lure people from here.",

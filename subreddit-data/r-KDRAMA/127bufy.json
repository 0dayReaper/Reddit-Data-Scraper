This year's theme is **Christmas in Summer Time** (or as my fellow southern hemisphere people know it, Christmas).\n\nIf you haven't watched *The Heirs*, watch episode 1 Chan Young &amp; Bona's introduction scene around the 9 minute mark.\n\nFor one day only (April 1, 2023 00:01 AM - 11:59 PM KST) we'll allow Heirs positive memes and fanart that follows our other DDay rules until the Heirs day loophole closes. Dissing The Heirs may earn you a permanent ban or an influx of Kim Tan memes. Subreddit decorations will stay up for at least a week.\n\nIf you would like to celebrate with a seasonal flair reply to this post with one of the following phrases (note that capitalization and spacing must be exact for it to work).\n\n**Traditional Heirs Day flair:** comment \"Happy Heirs Day!\"\n\n**To make your flair RED and keep your current flair text:** comment \"Team BoNa\", \"That's Not Red. That's Dark Red!\" or \"Today's Theme is Christmas in Summer\"\n\n**To make your flair DARK RED and keep your current flair text:** comment \"Team Chan Young\" or \"Dark Red is Red\"",

However, the most special is definitely the amount of *nuance* it has. It asks some difficult and even uncomfortable questions without providing ready-made answers to them. The characters are multilayered and, even if some of their actions can't be justified, you always understand why they came to develop their worldview. And frankly, it is often hard to blame them. \n\nI find it increadibly ironic how different it is from **The Glory**,\u00a0 which, by the way,\u00a0\u00a0 was written by the same screenwriter. In fact, the most distinguishing mark of **The Glory** is probably it's lack of nuance. Every character is either perfectly righteous or cartoonishly evil. The show thrives on pure emotion. And while it is a matter of chosen style, these two shows don't even seem to exist in the same universe, so it was ever harder to acknowledge that they were written by the same person. \n\nAll I can say is that this screenwriter has range. \ud83d\ude02",

The oldest kdrama I'd seen before this was **Descendants of the Sun** (2016) and I am LOVINGGGG the 2013-ness here, completely feels like something I'd watch after coming home from middle school. If, yknow, 12-year-old me remotely knew what a kdrama was.\n\nAll of the non-Korean actors belong in a TeenNick Original Series. I choose to believe that the LA episodes exist in the same cinematic universe as Victorious/iCarly/etc because that would be very funny.",

Has Jin Mu persuaded CP that it was CP who made Naksu come out and kill again? But we haven't seen it, we only saw Jin Mu planning it out and doing it.!&lt; So why would Jang Uk also be so angry at that person. It is true that &gt;!Jin Mu was left to live and wriggled himself to be blameless, but that is the King's law, no? And if Jin Mu was CP's tutor since childhood, he would be similar to Park Jin for Jang Uk, that is: Hard to kill.!&lt;\n\nWhen emo Seo Yul goes to save &gt;!that woman, Bu Yeon obviously cannot go with the mages from Jongjinjak,!&lt; and later there is a meeting there, and she has just disappeared. She is so useless she is just forgotten about, unless there is a love scene or a jealousy scene.\n\nThe entitlement of Seo Yul is just as annoying however many times I watch, possibly more since I know he is popular with the girl public. He thinks he should &gt;!save one but kill the other!&lt; and it is all on his shoulders. He has the right to decide life or death. Maybe it would have been less annoying for me if the actor had a few more expressions available.\n\nInterestingly enough, we use different brain circuits for the kill at the heat of the moment and the planned kill, and most countries have a punishment different depending on why the judge thinks you did it. But with Seo Yul it seems to be the parasite, which is very much like PANDAS, an OCD that comes from staph bacteria, or  I think, other types of microorganisms that sneak their way into your brain. Not sure if the writers really thought it out like that.\n\nThe drama didn't really know what to spend money on. The pointlessness of paying for all those extras to stand around and be guards all the time, instead of taking three months more to improve on that script. \n\nEach incident of a woman being useless would not be annoying if it was only that one, the problem is the accumulation of uselessness.",

But actually when time comes, she is going to give the body to Naksu and disappear \"because in any case she was not supposed to live\".!&lt; \n\nThen why does she say that in such a direct manner? My guess is that the writers were going to write this but in a roundabout way, so that it could be understood both ways, and we would keep the suspense for a while longer. She actually uses the pronoun \"tangshin\", where she could have just skipped the pronouns for suspense's sake. Instead she is telling us something wrong. \n\nAnd we never get to see SeonSaengNim Lee say &gt;!\"I was mistaken about this\"!&lt;\n\nEDIT: I will edit instead of replying to myself again. Other problem of useless women: They have divine powers. Supposedly able to trap a soul. But none of them manage to see the actual soul(s) in that body, or do anything about it. So, they don't actually have divine power anyway? Or it has been described wrong?",

Every time he appeared on screen I melted into a big puddle.  I love *love* Ji Chang Wook but this level of adorable is almost inhumane. \n\nActually his character is a more over-the-top version of his character in Backstreet Rookie, in which, he seemed to be pretty much playing himself\n\nI assume that eventually he will out himself, but I hope it's not soon because damn, this is awesome.",

Esom was &gt;!delightfully evil!&lt; in her role, and Kim Si-a was absolutely phenomenal as Boksoon's teenage daughter.\n\nThe biggest reference point as far as Western cinema is concerned would have to be *John Wick*. The action sequences were seriously vicious, but also had a poetic beauty. There was also a compelling imaginative aspect to the fight scenes, where &gt;!Boksoon would imagine her demise if she made the wrong move!&lt;. The film also touched on some important social issues.\n\nOverall, it's fitting that this movie premiered at the Berlin Film Festival, because I could imagine watching a film like this back when I used to attend my local film festival in Australia in the early 2000s.",

Check out the previews to see if it\u2019s your genre that you like watching, because there is gore but it\u2019s another great watch from the FL. /u/Telos07 you nailed it, for a reference, it\u2019s like a female John Wick. \n\nI\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t have a discussion post for it. I\u2019ve been searching thought the day and found none. \n\n/u/Telos07 I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but at the beginning, there\u2019s dialogue that mentioned a male name, just mentioning the name and with the back story of her as a single mother, and even scenes of her cook something tasty in the kitchen, reminded me of CCIR.",

            "comment": "Memoir of a Murderer, from 2017\n\nWell acted, well directed, well written and suspenseful. My favorite kind of movie.\n\nSol Kyung-gu (He's sooooo great in this role) plays Kim Byeong-soo, a man who looks to be in his 50s and who has begun to lose his memory.\n\nKim Nam-gil plays Min Tae-ju, a police officer who becomes the boyfriend of Kim Byeong-soo's devoted daughter, and also\n\nbecomes the object of her father's obsession.\n\nKim Nam-gil is very good here at playing someone who may or may not be a dangerous psychopath. For the first half of the movie, Min Tae-ju is not actually physically present very much, he's only seen here or there for a few moments, but he looms large. Kim Byeong-soo spends a lot of time thinking about him or talking about him to others, so even when he isn't there it feels like he is, and you're constantly in a state of unease, wondering what he's going to do or where he's going to show up next. I loved that.\n\nI also loved that it kept me guessing about things because of the condition Kim Byeong-soo is suffering with, so you don't know quite what to believe.\n\nThe second half gets even more interesting as it begins with a game of cat and mouse. But who is the cat? Who is the mouse?\n\nIt's so good. I actually had to pause it at one point and walk away to take a break from it for a few minutes. Things got too tense and I suddenly couldn't stand it. Probably because I watched it alone.\n\nThis is also perhaps the first thriller that made me feel sorry for a character I knew I had no business feeling sorry for, but he's got some big problems so I found myself feeling pity anyway.\n\nI don't want to say anymore because to fully appreciate it, this is a movie you want to go into cold, without knowing much about it. Having said that, the snakeskin print hoodie was a bit too on the nose, so to speak, but it was suitable to the character's cockiness at that point. (Also there's a cat with my first name in it. I can't tell you how weird it is to find a cat by that name anywhere)\n\nIt's a great watch, an outstanding thriller from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.",

Thankfully, it hasn't so far - for me - gone the way of Beyond Evil, which bored me to tears. \n\nDone with 6 episodes - I am honestly left bemused but also intrigued. Still early days, but I had to let my thoughts out! \n\nThe pace has been endlessly frenetic &gt;!with an endless number of murders!&lt;. This gets a bit much and more importantly, means logic and cohesive storytelling go out of the window a little too often. Episode 5 was particularly bad. But it's a kdrama at the end of the day, so I go along. \n \nWhat has however caught my interest is the show leaning into a narrative style that is designed to befuddle the viewer. I found it all too annoyingly muddled initially but soon I was trying to make sense by piecing together the various info morsels the show gives out. I got a few things right but I have to admit, the ending of the last two episodes caught me by surprise.  \n\nThis is my first Lee Seung Gi drama and I am liking his work, but Lee Hee Joon is riveting. I am assuming the show will soon shift focus to LSG. With all its faults, Mouse has sure as hell kept me glued. 14 more episodes to go!",

            "comment": "Semantic Error, from 2022, I guess it would be called a Boys Love or BL movie\n\nThere was an episodic drama, or is, I should say, and this is supposed to be the movie based on that drama. I haven't seen the drama so I can't compare them.\n\nIt was great, just two college dudes trying to figure things out, since this is the first same sex relationship for one, and the first relationship at all for the other.\n\nNo one around them gives a sh\\*t, they act the same towards them, give them the same advice they would if they were advising them about how to get along with a girl instead of another guy. I loved that. I don't know how realistic it is, but all their friends just didn't care and cheered them on. It was very refreshing.\n\nIt's no different than a hetero couple drama in how it's laid out, the only difference was one of the boys wasn't comfortable about getting involved with the other. So at first you think he doesn't want to be gay, but you quickly understand it's because he isn't comfortable with love and getting close to people emotionally in general, not about falling in love with another dude. It's a light and fluffy, as I've heard some dramas called.  I enjoyed it.",

Really wanted to love her, but she sadly had 0 backstory besides like a few lines. \n\nBadly-written female characters are the bane of my existence and kinda world wide problem lol, just write the female characters like you would any other well written character, done. still sad that this great kdrama also suffered from this.\n\nAlso the about of uncensored gore really (positively) suprised me, they even thought about &gt;!the brain matter after one character shot himself in the head, which is something i haven't seen before, especially uncensored!&lt;",

Sadly, I haven't managed to keep completely off the topic. I just thought that I kept repeating myself. \n\nOne thing is skewed gender representation. Another thing is how bad many women are at noticing. Example Kairos, I counted for a few episodes: They had five meetings with three friends, and in four of them the male friend was the one who got to come up with the ideas for a plan.\n\nYet Korean dramas are better than film from the West, at least those I know. Soaps are not really my thing, and to find science fiction or fantasy with good female characters, you have to really look. \n\nDespite my views on this, I think five of the around ten dramas I have seen this year have a male protagonist with three times the screen time of the female. Right now **Alchemy of Souls part two** (rewatch), which is so terrible from a feminist point of view that even normal watchers noticed. \n\nBecause there is a balance between the story I want to see and the male/female screen percentage, and I just can't watch stories I find dull even if it is about a woman.",

Her character had potential to play a role in the story, but they just didn\u2019t put any effort into writing the character. I understand that it serves a device to get us, the audience, to also be suspicious of Jong Suk too, but we were already getting subtle hints of that. The FL\u2019s role was to blatantly tell the audience to be suspicious and we didn\u2019t need that!&lt;",

So many great actors in this one, too many to list, but here is the cast list for you to see for yourself. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Outlaws\\_(2017\\_film)\r  \nEveryone did a great job, suspension of disbelief is absolutely no problem while watching the various characters, no matter what is going on in the story at any one moment. Whoever wrote the script, I bow to your talent.\r  \nA lot of characters with differing personalities to write, and you did it beautifully.\r  \nA lot of violence as this is a movie based on a real clean up of gangs in Korea in the early 2000s, however, \r  \nit never felt like too much. It was a great watch",

She looked so radiant. In the MV itself, there are two looks that I didn't like but the other looks were legend-wait-for-it-ary. Anyway I am happy for her but I also worry she might be over exerting herself. Hope she takes good care of her health. \n\nI got two more episodes of **Blue Birthday** left. I did notice at some point the title card changes from Blue to White. The ML can't act, sorry. He has the same aloof expressionless face like Bo Gum and Cha Eun Woo. \n\nI think I will start **Oasis** after I finish Blue Birthday. And I heard about this old Hong Kong movie that has Takeshi Kineshiro in it, so I am going to look that movie up. TK was my OG East Asian Celeb crush for the longest time.\n\nAlso Happy Birthday Jung HAE in (for tomorrow). \uc0dd\uc77c \ucd95\ud558\ud574\uc694.",

To up the ante, the rules have changed a bit to keep things interesting enough for me to continue. I start with one show (**Angel\u2019s last mission: love**), then watch the shows airing before (**Doctor Prisoner**) and after (**Justice**) in the same time slot. It's been fun! I have finished Doctor Prisoner and currently watching Justice. Both shows are darker and have a lot of back-and-forths in the plot than what I usually gravitate toward. The next on the list would be **When the Camellias Bloom**, but I\u2019ve already watched it.\n \nI may venture out of KBS2 shows to another network and see how they match up.",

    "postText": "**What Are On-Air Discussions?**\n\nOn-Air Discussions are dedicated weekly discussion posts for currently airing dramas. They are hosted by volunteers from the community to create a dedicated space each week to discuss what has happened in that drama for that week. On-Air drama discussions reduce clutter on the front page of the subreddit by centralizing discussion and all related content, such as news updates, previews, interviews, behind the scenes videos, etc.. \n\nIt is within these on-air discussion posts that the bulk of conversation in our subreddit takes place as we gather within them weekly to discuss the episodes we have watched.\n\nA table of currently ongoing On-Air Discussions can be found in the sidebar. See our [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) for all past On-Air Discussions. Latest On-Air Discussions for this week [here](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month).\n\nIf you wish to volunteer to host on-airs for an upcoming drama, please see how to in our [On-Air Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).\n\n**Purpose and History of On-Air Discussions System**\n\nThe on-air discussions have evolved from our earliest *ad hoc* discussion posts to a now highly organized and formalized system that includes specific requirements about the content and formatting of posts and requirements to become a volunteer host. The primary purpose of the on-air system is to consolidate all content about an airing drama into designated spaces so that viewers of an airing drama know exactly where to discuss and find information about a drama. A secondary and equally important purpose is to prevent posts about an airing overrunning the subreddit feed, making it impossible for users to find other content.\n\nIn order to achieve these two purposes, our rules for On-Air discussions require that all types of content about an airing drama to be posted in the on-air discussions (eg. commentary, promotional material, questions, etc.) with very limited exceptions for [certain news items](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_news_about_currently_airing_dramas) and qualifying fanart/meme posts on Designated Days. All other news items and content that do not qualify as an exception are to be posted within the on-air discussion posts or in our FFAs to ensure that content is consolidated and that the subreddit feed remains accessible for all of our other content.\n\nThis approach to consolidation developed over the years within our subreddit because our user base expressed a strong desire for our subreddit feed to not be overrun by a single drama or issue.\n\nWhile this approach will not seem ideal to some users, we ask that those users consider the fact that for any given drama, there are also many, *many* users within our community not following that drama and are completely uninterested in content about that drama. Consolidation to on-air threads allows those uninterested users to not have their subreddit feed be bombarded with posts about any one single drama while still allowing interested users a space for discussion. This is a compromise for all and has worked well for our community, we ask that users respect this compromise.\n\n**Number of Episodes Per Discussion Post**\n\nGenerally, the number of episodes per on-air discussion post is the same as the number of episodes aired or released per week. \n\nIn general, most kdramas air two episodes each week and thus most of our on-air discussions are two episodes per discussion post. We understand that some users will find this confusing or are afraid of spoilers, however this format has worked exceptionally well for our community as a whole. If you are worried about spoilers, we suggest that you sort comments by 'Old' to see the comments sequentially.\n\nFor some dramas, the on-air discussions may be one episode per discussion post. This is typically done for one of three reasons:\n\n* Above Average Engagement - when a drama is very popular and there is a lot of engagement, we may split to single episode discussion posts to make commenting more manageable. Currently our standard for this is that *each episode* must garner at least ~600 comments to merit splitting into single episode discussion posts. This means that pre-split, a discussion post for two episodes should garner over 1,200 comments.\n\n&gt; **Eligibility for Split** As part of regular moderation workflow, all on-air discussions are monitored for amount of engagement and on-air hosts partake in this monitoring. Once a post has crossed the 1,200 threshold, this is communicated between the mod team and the on-air host and arrangements are made for future splitting of discussion threads. However, the mod team also monitors for quality of discussion and low quality/low effort comments, including comments petitioning for split episode threads, are considered comment bloat will be disregarded when evaluating the need to split discussion threads.\n\n* User &amp; Content Management - when a drama is controversial and we expect or have experienced an excessive amount rule-breaking behavior, we may split to single episode discussions to make moderation easier and more manageable.\n\n* Release Schedule Management - when there are doubts, changes, or interruptions to release schedule, we may use single episode discussion posts to assist in posting schedule.\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions/Concerns**\n\n* Why not make one episode/discussion post threads for all dramas?\n\n&gt; We do not do one episode/discussion posts for most dramas for two reasons: 1) most dramas never garner enough engagement to justify two threads and 2) it's a lot of work for the volunteer hosts. If all dramas had separated episode threads, there will be a lot of \"dead\" threads with less than 50 comments. We're trying to aim at a balance between the amount of work volunteer hosts have to put in versus keeping the discussions centralized and the home feed 'clean' thus we have most on-air discussions with episodes combined.\n\n* Combined episode discussion threads mean that comments are out of order and hard to read.\n\n&gt; Nearly all posts in our community default to 'Best' as the way comments are sorted. For on-airs, we suggest two approaches to comment sorting:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Use Old to see comments sorted by posting time from oldest to newest, this is the best approach to avoid spoilers for second episodes.\n&gt;\n&gt; * Use New to see comments sorted by posting time from newest to oldest, this is the best approach to see comments about the latest episode.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a setting that you can personally set as you would prefer. If you need further assistance in learning how to Reddit, refer to Reddit Help.\n\n* Why not automate the discussion posting?\n\n&gt; Some of the other show subreddits will often utilize bots or other form of automation for the episode discussions -- this **is not** a viable system for us because of the Korean broadcast system -- namely the fairly often broadcast interruptions due to either special events or issues related to live production of the drama.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kdramas regularly announce broadcast changes the day of broadcast -- it is far easier to coordinate with a 'live' on-air host than to mess with the automation, sometimes simply because we don't get much info ahead of time on how the broadcast is going to go. In addition to verifying broadcast information, 'live' hosts are also great because they serve as \"semi-mods\" since they monitor the threads and gives the mod team a heads up if discussions in the threads seem to be going awry, which helps us stave off some of the worst confrontations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hosts volunteering to host a drama is also a way the mod team 'measures' interest in an upcoming drama and simplifies the process of which dramas get to have on-airs. We have a lot of on-airs but even then, there are still airing dramas that are not getting on-air discussions (due to lack of interest or streaming availability).\n\n* Why does [DRAMA] not have on-air discussions?\n\n&gt; All on-air discussions are hosted by volunteers from our community. While we do have a requirement that a drama must have at least one legal international streaming source to qualify for on-air discussions, other than that, the mod team does not make decisions on which dramas have on-air discussions or not. If a drama you are interested in discussing does not have on-air discussions, you can consider volunteering to host them. Otherwise, discussions in FFAs and other weekly threads are always welcomed.\n\n**Limits On Participation**\n\nWhile on-air discussions generally are open to all users, there are cases where we may place limits on who can participate in certain on-air discussion threads. We place limits on participation when we observe enough problematic conduct that warrants additional measures. These measures are typically placed through certain Automoderator filters and in more serious instances, we may activate our [On-Air Passport](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/on-air-passport/) system.\n\nLimits to participation are generally instituted against accounts without sufficient participation history in our subreddit. \n\nIf you are a lurker in our subreddit, please be aware that the mod team cannot verify 'lurking' history so when we are evaluating past participation in our community, we can only look at a user's comment and post history. If you have no comment or post history, your account will be viewed as having no history of participation in our community.\n\nWe encourage users to comment in our subreddit, especially our weekly [What Are You Watching?](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/search?q=title:%22What%20Are%20You%20Watching%22&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) threads to build up community participation history.\n\n---\n\n*Note:* This post is part of our recurring post series 'The r\\/KDRAMA Approach' which highlights different aspects of our subreddit moderation approach and policies.

Different stylistically from other dramas in that it's more muted (lots of neutral, darker tones) and the OST is very chill and low-key.\nIt's a workplace drama about a few new hires at a huge corporation and how they adapt to their new lives inside and outside of work.\nIt touches on a lot of current workplace issues (discrimination, harassment, integrity) and the character development is great- a lot of grey area characters who are neither too 'good' or blatantly evil.\nIt is long (20 eps, each ep at least 70 min long) and a bit of a slow burn, but well worth it to follow the journey of the characters- especially if you've experienced corporate life yourself.",

I didn't have to skip as much on Ep.9 because most of the information was relevant to pushing the story forward.\n\nThe beginning of this show was really a mess with the split focus on the family shenanigans and the spy story. All the main characters are amazing actors and the chemistry between Jang Hyuk and Jang Nara is great since they have worked together so many times. They're totally believable as a married couple and the tension in this episode was so palpable and well done. Hope they start figuring things out in Ep. 10.\n\nI wish they hadn't pushed the reveal so far with all the filler. There are only 3 episodes left to pull all the strings together.",

But we're at the penultimate week, and they still have not come clean with each other and start working together to get rid of the union, like, what a waste of chemistry. They both have the same motivation, the same purpose in life, why is the story dragging on when we're nearing the end?",

Also, the husband sucks as a spouse, and I've yet to understand how their marriage survived. He's emotionally unavailable and straight-up ignores his wife most of the time unless he's trying to do the dirty.",

    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "Recently finished Five Enough. I was only interested in Sung Hoon at the beginning, but by the end I really got into the entire show. Such solid acting from all the cast. Sung Hoon caught my interest after the scene in My Secret Romance where he meets &gt;!his mom!&lt; and cries through the entire meal. I think that was the only memorable scene for me in that drama. He did a great job in Five Enough, showed multiple layers of his character and was not afraid to look ridiculous. I wish he got better roles after Five Enough.\n\nCurrently watching The K2. What can I say, sometimes I laugh out loud, because Ji Chang Wook is just so darn attractive as he fights and loves. His chemistry with Song Yoon-ah is amazing. The umbrella scene is one of my favorites. I saw many comments that him and SFL should be together, but I like that he is with FL. SFL is just too dangerous and jaded for his wounded soul. I've got a bottle of wine and will finish up this series tonight and then cry into my pillow, because how can a man be so handsome?\n\nETA I had some more thoughts.",

            "comment": "I'm up to the final episode of *Just Between Lovers/Rain or Shine*, and still enjoying this very good show just as much. One of the things I deeply like about K-drama series is that they often represent people who are struggling in life, and the process of dealing with that suffering - including finding happiness in life, despite that. I love how they portray relationships as healing and so genuinely loving; people willing to sacrifice for the other, because they want their happiness so much. People helping each other express their frustrations and uncertainties and not just try to be strong, but trying to be strong for them. Finding healing together and deepening their love and growing in wisdom because they have suffered or are suffering. Finding the redemption and joy that comes from all of this. This show has all of these things. \n\nI'm going slower with *Shopaholic Louis*; I think my appetite for enduring the silly and frustrating in it has been used up a bit. I still like it, but am just not as eager to watch it as quickly as at first. This actually often happens with series. I go fast at the beginning, then slow a bit as I become more emotionally tied to it/the characters/what happens. Or when I just feel frustrated by all the circular messiness. With this, for example, I dislike so much what the director is doing, when he knows what he knows, and how much that hurts Louis. \n\nI'm finally nearing the end of *Come and Hug Me*! I took a long break, but have reached the final episode.",

(And why?)\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we  encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they dropped certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas  without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all.  This serves to both inform others who may be wary of certain aspects of dramas they wish to avoid and others who have watched the dramas in full  may be able to encourage users to pick up dramas again in the future if  the problems they had were only momentary aspects of the drama.\n\n**Please remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.** \n\n***Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.***\n\nWhen participating in this discussion remember, whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. **Be kind to one another.**\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted.

There wasn\u2019t quite as much of that screech factor going on.

If everyone says its horrible I don't even bother watching. \n\nThe last ongoing drama I watched all the way through was Bora Deborah. I'm a sucker for rom coms and nowadays I feel like they all want to add in random stupid plot lines (murder, serial killers) and I just want something cute and brainless sometimes. \n\nThe last drama I dropped was Heavenly Idol after episode 2.

After seeing her lash out like that in the first few eps, I don't think I like the idea of the drama forcing them to be together? \n* **Emergency Couple -** Big fan of Song Ji Hyo but the script is a bit annoying. I can't understand why the main leads just can't have a mature conversation about her work lol \n* **You Raise Me Up** \\- I've watched a lot of dramas and know that this tackles a topic that is rarely shown so I'm usually all for that, but the two doctors practically playing with the ML's life put me off so much especially since I come from a medical field myself. \n* Others I don't even have an excuse for: **Cunning Single Lady, Come Back Mister, The Scholar Who Walks the Night, Arthdal Chronicles** \n\nHopefully I'll be able to get out of this slump and back to watching these in the future!",

At the time I had no idea who the actors were, and I had just completed maybe one or two RomComs, so I thought either I just got lucky with those or maybe Kdramas were just good with that genre, so with a historical drama, I thought no way it could be any good.

It's interesting to see that wasn't the case for you. I'm also a fan of fantasy and historical dramas so I don't know what is up with me with Arthdal lol. Hopefully I'll get to see it before season 2 is released hahaha.",

This one I might try again\n\n-gaus electronics: honestly just not my type of show lol the humor was hit or miss and I didn\u2019t feel connected to any of the chat \n\n-the king loves: dropped at ep 7 because i looked up spoilers and decided the watch is just not worth it for that ending lmao\n\n-love alarm: dropped at ep 5 didn\u2019t really go into this with high expectations but started it after watching another high school drama. FL was making me mad plus I have a hard time enjoying the ride of a show if I know the couple I want doesn\u2019t end up together",

I think part of the show is trying to show the missteps people can make in dealing with suicidal people, but at times it can feel distasteful or like just straight misinformation. \n\nI\u2019m about to start episode 11, but I\u2019m struggling.  Anyone else have similar thoughts while watching? Is it worth it to keep going? \n\n(Also, the dog episode was cute and all it, but\u2026. why???)",

It's a show that thinks it's so deep and takes itself so seriously even though it's totally ridiculous and that juxtaposition between its lofty ambitions and its incompetence was kind of fascinating.  \n\nUnfortunately after that intriguing start it quickly became slow and mopey rather than fast paced and histrionic like I was hoping (it didn't help that the actor playing the second male lead gave one the flattest performances I've ever seen from a supposed professional) and I dropped it after 5 episodes.",

It's worth watching for me in that Cha Eun Woo is hilarious in here and I usually like stuff where Kim Nam Gil stars in too, but I'm not feeling the FL at all and I really hate the extra disgusting demonic leeches in this show. \n\nMost of the reason I started to watch it is to see if Kdramas would do better with an action webtoon than Uncanny Counter did (which also disappointed me) and I guess I kinda do like the fight scenes but the actual story is kinda ehh. Like I'd probably consider this plot a lot more serviceable if I was watching a movie instead of like 12-13 hours of tv drama.\n\nSomething I did decide to drop is **Golden Empire** because it rehashes the same thing within itself so damn much I don't feel like any real progress is being made. I forgot why I'm supposed to care about avenging whatever. I lost track of how all this business being made gets us anywhere. But I'm still seeing the struggle go on the way it kept going because this whole shebang is a contest in how stubborn you can get to win no matter what or how often you lose.\n\nWhat I did finish but would never recommend other people to bother with is **Hong Cheon Gi.** This is also a drama with way too much redundancy and like its not even really going for plot twists anyway. I would have found it perfectly rewatchable if it was a movie instead cause it only has a movie's amount of necessary events.\n\nFeels like all the dramas I've been trying since like 2020 (which isn't many) share this factor of making me think there's no reason this had to be a drama over a movie or two instead. It's ok to have relatively low substance if it just doesn't also occupy as much time as what something with more to tell would need.",

As an Asian I can say that the majority of the population is still biased over neurodivergent people , ignore how much effort they put in just to survive, live and learn, they prefer to discriminate against them as a burden of society.  I would have liked the show to focus more on how the FL fights her own way without taking the post that the corrupted boss lady gave her. I don't understand why she didn't take the job offer by the other female lawyer \ud83d\ude14 \nI heard there would be a season 2, I hope that will be better portrayed in reality than sugarcoating with green flag ML and cute puppy love romance",

Although I love Ahn Hyo Seop and LSK, it\u2019s not holding like Hospital Playlist.  Oh, well.  \n\nI beginning to think that episode 4 of dramas Is the turning point.  It\u2019s when the exposition really ends and if anything is going to happen, it all hapoens in that episode. But that means we have to invest at least 4 hours of time.

I was invested in Kill Me, Heal Me early in the first episode before I realized that Hwang Jung Eum was the FL. She\u2019s nearly the same awful character as in She Was Pretty and every other drama of hers I\u2019ve watched for a short time but abandoned because she\u2019s so awful. The hyper act with hollering and screeching is nerve wracking. The ML gives a good performance and it\u2019s clear which personality emerges before it\u2019s stayed. \n\nThe depiction of treatment for mental illness was predictably bad, though I at least liked that the head psychiatrist was chubby rather than looking like a handsome drama actor.",

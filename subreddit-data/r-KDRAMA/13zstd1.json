What about werewolf hunters in Seoul? Hyun Bin as Van Helsing? I'd watch that. Lee Soo Hyuk could play Dracula. He'd eat that role up!\n\nA superheroes trend? I haven't seen one drama like that (and Blade Man doesn't count) A Korean remake (or something like) The Boys would be killer. Watch Jung Hae In's girlfriend explode in front of him? Hell yes!\n\nThis is what goes through my head when I binge shows back to back.",

            "comment": "I recently finished watching [Nothing But You](https://mydramalist.com/70243-nothing-but-love), a 38-episode cdrama that follows Song San Chuan (Leo Wu), a young and headstrong badminton player with a lot of potential, held back by a trauma from his past, and Liang You An (Zhou Yu Tong), an executive assistant to one of Y-Sports managers, who excels at her job (think PMY's Secretary Kim) and is also held back (by her boss) and looking for a change.\n\nThe show has a series of arcs, starting with the badminton arc, as Liang You An is scouting for young talents on behalf of her boss; then follows the transition arc, where San Chuan starts making the transition from badminton to tennis, with You An transitioning from executive assistant to manager of a tennis club; and the, let's call it ascendance arc, that marks San Chuan's rising status as a tennis star, with all the good and bad that entails. A comparison to something like *Hot Stove League* is not ideal but also not the worst, especially for the transition and maybe even the ascendance arcs, as You An is brought in by her boss to shape this \"rich kids\" club into a serious professional endeavour, much like Seung Soo was brought in as general manager of the baseball team. Of course, with the added spice of the manager falling for one of her players, to mixed results.\n\nThis drama started out great and continued so for the longest while. Leo Wu nails it as a teenager, bringing in the passion, energy, stubbornness, and even sulkiness one would expect from his character, yet with an air of wisdom about him, perhaps reminiscent of *Just Between Lovers*' Lee Kang Doo. Abandoned by his mother, a professional badminton player with high expectations for her son, San Chuan was brought up by his step dad, played by the great Tu Song Yan, who also played an amazing single dad in 2020's *Go Ahead*, as well as the businessman-turned-Taoist-monk in this year's excellent *Meet Yourself*. On the other hand, Liang You An is the perfect example of a highly intelligent and talented businesswoman held back as an assistant by her boss (who's relied on her to survive company infighting for too long), and who's afraid of commitment due to her mom's influence, whose marriage ended in divorce and usually pops up to spat venomous words against marriage at her daughter, one of those tropes that is not particularly new under the sun.\n\nOther worthy mentions in the supporting cast include the FL's best friend, Luo Nian (played by Jiang Pei Yao from *Go Go Squid!* and *You Are My Hero*), a single mom and nutritionist who eventually makes her way to You An's tennis club and has a cute, but discreet, relationship with the new tennis coach, Zhang Yan (Zhang Tao), the typical hardass who'll bring the most out of his players through sometimes unconventional training. Honestly, it's a shame the show didn't give these two more screentime. There's also the second lead relationship between Jiang Jiao Jiao (Xia Hao Ran), the son of You An's boss and also a tennis player, and Liang Tao (Ma Fan Ding), a streamer and You An's half-sister. And, of course, there's Jiao Jiao's mom, Chen Ke (Guo Ke Yu), who's a total boss.\n\nFor the longest while, this show was headed into 9-10 territory for me. The show felt very grounded, with a similar vibe to *Go Ahead*, so much so I checked if the screenwriter was the same (it wasn't), but it also had the right amount of levity. It didn't try to easily dismiss San Chuan's trauma (at first), and I welcomed his decision to leave badminton behind in search for greener pastures. And all throughout this San Chuan and You An had some great chemistry together, and it could be argued they continued to have this chemistry throughout the show. Indeed, whenever the show diverted our attention to Liang Tao's or Jiao Jiao's story arcs in the earlier portion of the show I could hardly be bothered. However, for me, the more significant issues probably started occurring once the transition arc started.\n\nAt first it was the little things, like featuring a bunch of new female tennis players up on the club's wall who maybe appeared once or twice and never talked. I was disappointed that the show couldn't be bothered to incorporate them into the storyline, but maybe it would've become something like *Age of Youth* (I'm up for it!) and, frankly, the show doesn't have an episode to spare as it is. Another issue that follows from this is that the few players we have been following don't really have arcs of their own, save for Sang Chuan and Jiao Jiao. Everyone else is strictly relegated to the background/support character department. I also personally felt there weren't that many matches, especially during the third arc of the show, and even less featuring the supporting characters.\n\nThe execution of San Chuan's arc, as well as his relationship with You An, has its share of issues. His trauma rears its head again during the transition arc and his badminton coach suggests it has to do with his emotional state, as he's someone who can be overcome by his feelings. This suggested the trigger was now related to his relationship with You An, which had gone through a rough patch at the time (what is never addressed, a particularly sore issue), but the show decides this is still tied to his mom and magically resolves it in one episode. With the magical solution applied, San Chuan is instantly back to winning! This struck me as entirely naive, what didn't jibe with the show's more mature approach. Another time the story brings us close to the badminton court again, what I felt was an opportunity for the character to neatly close that chapter of his life. However, with the sole exception of an appearance once or twice by the previous characters, nothing comes off it, what had me wondering, \"Why even bother then?\" This is just one example of the show trying to tie in everything together, but failing at the execution.\n\nPerhaps the greatest weakness of this character's arc is trying to encompass too much. It's the story of the underdog overcoming his mental trauma, becoming a tennis player, rising through the ranks, overtraining and injuring himself for a shot at glory, undergoing recovery to make a comeback, making said comeback in a match that occurs off-camera, quickly rising to the top again only to be exploited by You An's previous company, then making a clean break to become an international star, again off-camera. The only thing missing is fame rising to his head, becoming too full with himself, burning bridges to the past, then going to the park one night to witness some kids playing tennis and recalling that love for the sport that makes him become a better man.\n\nMany of the turning points for the different stages of this journey come across as forced, like San Chuan &gt;!brashly signing a contract of indentured servitude!&lt; without telling You An, an event that momentarily creates tension for the couple... only to be defused minutes later when You An acknowledges he did the right thing. What? How is this your conclusion? Forget that, how do you get past this issue within minutes?! To make matters worse, this is a result of You An also previously making a similar rash decision &gt;!to accept a wildcard entry to a tournament for the price of \"You'll have to accept whatever I ask of you in the future\",!&lt; one of those rarer moments (sadly, not the only one) our smart FL decides to go brain dead, forgetting this is a company that has *consistently* screwed her over in the past. There are other forced events, but none on this level of stupidity. Oh, yeah, there's one I forgot, why did she never hire a lawyer for her club? That would've saved us a ton of drama.\n\nThe main couple's romantic relationship suffers from constantly being delayed and restarted (reason why our secondary couple's relationship is quickly expedited through to marriage). San Chuan can never seem to move past the \"I'm doing this for you\" stage, what had me metaphorically banging my head against the wall, and You An does come across as unapologetically manipulative at times, choosing silence instead of being honest about her feelings. This dance went on and on, to the point I gave up on them. By the time the cutesy, romantic moments came, I was already on the fast-forward train. Frankly, the second leads probably have the healthier relationship.\n\nGoing by the wall of text I've written you'd think this is a terrible show. It isn't. I'd say this is an above average show, comfortably sitting in my 7-8 bin, and probably closer to an 8. It's just that I had to recalibrate my expectations after its strong opening and based off other, similar, sports-themed shows/movies. If you choose to watch this, I'll think you have a good, if not great, time, especially if you can buy into the main couple's relationship for longer than I did. Though it is somewhat telling that I found the most memorable scene in the show to be [this one](https://youtu.be/mepJat8i1DE?t=1441), where Jiao Jiao invites his dad to his club to show him what he's learned playing tennis for so long.",

There are still some rough spots (particularly near the end) but it's more in the 8-8.5/10 range thanks to a shorter length (26eps) and tighter story since it was based off a novel.",

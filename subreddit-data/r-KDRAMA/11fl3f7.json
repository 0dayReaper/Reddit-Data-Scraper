    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

Even though a big plot point in the later episodes was Ji-Ho trying to get Se-Hee to try and open up it felt like he really didn\u2019t, at least not enough for her to plot the whole like divorce &gt; dating scenario. She still carried a lot of the weight of the relationship. !&lt; but even with that I really liked the show and liked the ending. My favorite character was the cat",

Wasn't really frustrated by the ML, because the whole point of the drama was to see his evolution from completely emotionally available to healing and being able to love again.  It was beautiful to see.  Some memorable scenes are when he breaks down missing her, and when she comes back and he thinks he is dreaming.  That was one of my first dramas, so this really had an impact on me.  I've seen similar scenes since then, but I guess you don't forget your first \ud83d\ude0a.  Another memorable scene is when he runs his ass off to save her, &gt;!only to discover she was never in danger.!&lt;  He is a really good actor.  I remember his face when he is sitting across from the &gt;!man that assaulted her!&lt; and the way it changed as he started to understand what he was saying.\n\nEven though he played an emotionally frozen man, his face was really expressive, but in a subtle way that made it worth watching.\n\nThe FL was awesome too, and I watched it because she was in Alchemy of Soul.  I really liked her in both.  In a way, &gt;!she got her happy ending in this drama. It was healing after watching the end of AOS!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The obligatory break-up part of the drama was hard to watch and broke my heart, but it made sense and was necessary.  She had to know her own heart as well as make him realize his own.  A separate was necessary.  That it was harsher than it should have been is something I've come to expect from k-dramas.!&lt;\n\n/sigh.  I wish I could watch it again for the first time.",

            "comment": "I recently finished **Should We Kiss First?** I saw this drama highly recommended on a kdrama blog (though I can't remember which one now!) and finally took the time to watch it. It's a slow, healing drama about two older adults (approaching their 50s) who get a second chance at love. Each is dealing with trauma. I liked the drama, but did find that something seemed to be lost in the translation. Probably 8/10? Maybe 8.5?\n\nI'm more than halfway through **Five Enough** (28/54). This one took a while to grow on me. I *loved* **My Father is Strange** and **Once Again.** I've found myself fast forwarding through some storylines; I'm not super interested in Mi Jeong's ex husband and their woes, and I've ff'ed a lot of Sang Tae's in laws. I'm loving Shin Hye Sun in this one.",

I now have 10 ongoing ones.\n \n**Crash Course in Romance**  It's wrapping up next week and I'm looking forward to the conclusion. I was annoyed with it for a while because I thought the murder mystery was a distraction until I (and most of the sub) realized that it's not a rom-com.  If you view it with the right lens, the frustration disappears. \n\n**Jinxed at First**  Quirky, but not amazing. It has bad reviews.  I'll see how far I get.\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** - Starting watching but I think I'll wait till it finishes airing.  I do like it, especially the ML.  His acting gives me theatre vibes.\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** Watched a couple of episodes, will wait until it finishes airing.\n\n**Run On** AMAZING and underrated drama.  A MUST-watch. I can't even express how good it is.  The relationships are so realistic and both couples are interesting to watch.    The FL is a translator and one of the underlying themes of the drama is communication.  Read about this drama on dramabeans, if you want to know more.  I have two episodes left and I don't want to watch them because I don't want it to end.\n \n**Strangers Again**  Only one episode left to watch.  I enjoyed it, but am not motivated to finish it since I know how it ends.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol** is My absolute favourite on-air drama.  I  drop everything when a new episode was out. The ML is hilarious.  He was the SML in A Business Proposal.\n\n**The Law Cafe** Need to continue, it kind of got sideline.  Not much romance yet, so it's not keeping my attention\n\n**The Uncanny Counter**  I'm almost finished.  This is definitively worth a watch for it's found a family theme.\n\n**Two Cops**  It's a good drama, but I am so ADD when it comes to dramas.  I'll finish it I promise.",

He comes from a small rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul \u2013 and the same university \u2013 after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends. Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone \u2013 and share a kiss. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?

            "comment": "as episode 4 finished and the piano music started playing, i began to cry. this drama is so beautiful and moving in ways that are hard to put into words. nevertheless, i shall attempt to do so\u2026\n\nwhat particularly struck me about episode 4 was the focus on mental health and depression. jae won says the following to his therapist, something that struck a real chord: \u201ci want to free myself from human relationships. i\u2019m getting sick of myself wearing a mask when i\u2019m dealing with others.\u201d this relates to his conversation with yoon won in episode 3, where he shares that he\u2019s often pretending to be friendly, to like that which he does not truly like. outwardly, he\u2019s the charismatic leader, free from burdens and envied by all. but the mask he wears is a heavy one, the struggle to pretend everything is fine more than exhausting. \n\nwhat jae won will likely come to learn over the course of this drama, a message of great value to those who experience these same feelings, is that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be loved by everyone\u201d. \n\nand whatever point in life you\u2019re at, it\u2019s \u201cnot too late to start a new thing,\u201d a much needed reminder for anyone who feels that they are too old to pursue something that\u2019s of interest to them or create a new dream. \n\nif jae won\u2019s predicament is that he\u2019s been \u201cavoiding reality,\u201d it\u2019s clear that the time he\u2019s spending with ji hyun is providing him with the courage, freedom and space to slowly remove the mask and begin to face the things he\u2019s been running from. \n\nfor ji hyun, his relationship with jae won, as well as the friendships he\u2019s formed since moving to the city (be it with his manager &gt;!or the girl it turns out is *not* interested in him romantically!&lt;), sees a change in his confidence levels. compared to the first two episodes, he\u2019s more self assured and less deferential; a relatable character in the sense that his personality shines most when he feels comfortable. &gt;!though the country mouse is becoming more city mouse, he remains polite and acquiescent when required (the self restraint he showed when being harassed by eun ji was something to behold, though i\u2019d love for him to learn that he should never have to accept that kind of treatment).!&lt; i also really appreciate that he\u2019s an introvert who doesn\u2019t feel a pressure to become outgoing amongst those he doesn\u2019t know or trust.\n\nin episode 4, we see the central pairing become more relaxed in each other\u2019s presence, and a little more themselves. the tension remains, but they\u2019re also more free to tease each other; compared to the first two episodes, they\u2019re on more equal footing. &gt;!the library scene was one of my favourites, in particular the moment at which ji hyun enthusiastically waves at jae won from across the room and holds up his drawing. the smile this brings to jae won\u2019s face and the happiness on ji hyun\u2019s own had me tearing up. i hope ji hyun never destroys that sketch, and wonder whether the thing jae won dreams of learning really will make him famous.!&lt;\n\noverall, these two episodes very much lived up to my expectations, offering emotional depth in ways i wasn\u2019t quite expecting. &gt;!episode 3 was harder to watch as i felt so much empathy for ji hyun, but i\u2019m very glad the \u201cjae won pretends the kiss didn\u2019t happen\u201d only lasted the one episode. both characters have some way to go before they\u2019re wholly open with each other, all masks removed, but i\u2019m so loving the story that\u2019s unfolding.!&lt;\n\nfinal note: &gt;!the hand holding (in particular, end of episode 4 and earlier on when ji hyun teaches jae won how to draw) is so romantic it makes my heart skip a beat.!&lt;\n\nedit: spoiler tags added",

I am a huge proponent of mental health positivity, and am very open about my own issues and that I see a psychologist regularly, so seeing these scenes is so welcome.

But on the other hand, showing off the main character's English weirdly is a plot point in most dramas, so I guess that's where they were going with that.\n\nI actually like the choppy editing though. It's kinda frustrating when important pieces are missing (like one or two seconds between episode 2 and 3), but it also makes you pay attention to small details. Normally I would be annoyed by this kind of \"artsy\" style, but for college dramas I like it - it somehow adds to the vibes.",

                    "comment": "I thought the editing was deliberate and I really like it. Makes the viewers have to piece things together and pay attention to details, plus I think the greatest strength of this show is how the viewer is left in the dark as to many things the characters could also be in the dark about, leaving us to feel the same kind of tension and uncertainty about what's really happening that the characters do.  \n\n\nI don't normally watch BLs so idk how the editing normally is but one thing that kdramas tend to do (which is occasionally a strength, but often a weakness of kdrama) is excessive tell-not-show exposition with flashbacks, monologues, characters talking out loud to themselves like the local homeless guy off his meds, etc. which leads the audience to know WAY more about the characters' backgrounds, feelings, thoughts, inner monologues and motivations than you normally do in western shows. This can be really interesting and cool in character-driven dramas but it can also lead to a situation where it's hard to emotionally connect with characters or empathize with them since you know WAY more than they know about the situations they're in and can't 'feel' those situations the way they can.  \n\n\nThis show is doing a really good job of withholding enough from viewers that you can experience the tension, uncertainty about mixed messages, anxiety etc. in the same way they do  because you aren't given full timelines or info about who was calling on the phone when, why his crush broke up with his gf, what he was doing before &gt;!they coincidentally ran into each other on the train!&lt;, what the motivation for certain actions like &gt;!the kiss!&lt; was etc. I think this is the reason for the choppy editing and it's one of the show's biggest strengths imo (the others being the sound editing/soundtrack and the acting). Having the kind of omniscience about events and character motivations/thoughts viewers usually do in typical kdramas makes you a lot less stressed and a lot more certain what will happen, and also can cause you as a viewer to judge characters as stupid, but here since you are in much the same position as the characters are you feel their struggles along with them.",

I think what was weird for me with these two episodes was editing wise, it felt choppier then the first two episodes but also again to your point might be intentional. \n\nI watch quite a few BLs when I\u2019m in between dramas and I think hopefully this one does pushes the envelope a bit. It\u2019s also longer in running time then many BLs which I like to see at 30 min a episode instead of the usual 8-10 minutes. \n\nI think either way the set up of this show is really intriguing and has enough going on where I will look forward to it weekly.",

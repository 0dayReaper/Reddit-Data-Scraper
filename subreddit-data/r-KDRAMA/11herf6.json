And of course the father &amp; grandpa dynamic are so pure and hilarious. So far the plots resolve and then evolve at a good pace for me vs dragging out too much.

For some reason, I decided to restart the Law Cafe; I had started it like a year prior but was so horrified by the tracksuits Lee Seung-gi had to wear that I stopped LOLL\n\nBut on the second try, I was totally hooked! For me, it really had a little bit of everything and I enjoyed the different cases they handled. The characters were fun, and the leads had amazing chemistry; I did find the interspersed interlude interviews (the camera would focus on one character and that character would break the 4th wall and give some commentary about what's happening) a unique choice and I admit it did take awhile to get used to, probably about the 3rd episode.\n\nBut overall, highly highly recommend! It's super entertaining and will take you on a (fun and non-sickening) rollercoaster of emotions in the best way. I think it would also be a great drama for kdrama newbies!",

            "comment": "After watching dramas or during really I have a habit of checking what else actors have been in and sometimes I pick up new shows from it. That was the case with Kim Ok-vin and Teo Yoo in **Love to Hate You** which itself was an entertaining comedy but I learned they were in a show called **Arthdal Chronicles**, with the former playing one of the main characters and the latter having a smaller role in the first episode.\n\nA Korean take on Game of Thrones is an interesting prospect and in some ways it's different to any K-drama I watched before. Crafted with love full of gorgeous scenes and cinematography it's worth a watch just for some of the epic set design and well crafted scenes. The story is set in a fictional world where one race of humans plots to kill off a beautiful and stronger race called the Neanthal who refuse their attempts to grab their lands for farming and join their alliance of tribes followed by a war. Greed takes hold years later and the human tribes find themselves endlessly in civil war with various factions plotting. A human woman escapes to another land with her half-breed child and later that land and tribe they join is invaded leading to the main plot which uses a lot of ideas about how religion and mythology are formed.\n\nThere are some great performances here, I enjoyed Kim Ji-won as a tribal priestess trying to survive and navigate a new world she found herself after her tribe is conquered and she's taken as a slave (her scene in the temple performing the dance is one of my favourite scenes in a drama. Unfortunately she won't be in the forthcoming new season which is set years later and they changed two of the main actors unfortunately who were both excellent. I also loved Erika Karata as the leader of the Momo tribe but her affair scandal with a married Japanese actor cost her a lot of work so I don't know if she'll get to reprise her role.\n\nLow points are that episodes tend to drag on quite a bit. Each episode is 1 hour and 20 minutes, I think the first episode may have been extended too. They probably could have cut out 20 minutes from each episode and lost nothing, some scenes are quite rambling and slow. A whole 6 minute scene of a women splashing around in water wailing while a priest prays was grating. The other thing that was grating was the performance of a couple of cast members who clearly have more experience with romantic office dramas and can't tap into their character well. Yoon Sa-Bong is one of the most grating as her over exaggerated body language and foot tapping feels more at home as a comedy side character in an office whining about men and begging for gossip than as the servant of a princess. It's a shame she wasn't better directed but I always feel like many Korean directors are more interested in the shot than the acting and let actors become typecast where they always play the same character.\n\nThey do take a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones, from Tagon's Jon Snow cosplay and his personal army resembling the Night's Watch to Eun-seom's whole slave freeing storyline, it's quite obvious they were heavily inspired by it but there is enough that it still feels original. Imagine that show mixed with Korean fantasy and mythology and you pretty much arrive at Arthdal Chronicles.\n\nIf you can get past the long runtime over several episodes then the good moments are well worth some of the parts that drag on and the repetitiveness seen in many historical dramas about old men scheming for power that keep winning again every time it looks like they might finally get their comeuppance. Though I guess Game of Thrones had that for several seasons of \"lol Cersei wins\".",

Hope it stays kinda fluffy; after the shitshow that\u2019s been work I need cotton candy romance. Feels like a live action Lucy Score romance novel!\n\nGoing to wait on Prison Playbook. I started it but was distracted. The mister comes home in a few weeks and perhaps he\u2019ll like it.\n\nSo with that first episode along with the two part season 1 finale of iZombie\u2026this ajumma knows how to party on a Friday night #eyeroll.",

It's a story of two people who enter into an unusual arrangement in order to make living together acceptable. It explores marriage vs love, against the backdrop of the rigid gender values of Korean society. The male and female leads couldn't be more different, which makes their communication (and lack thereof) both extremely interesting and frustrating. Sexism plays a huge part in this series, not just for the FL, but one of her best friends too. I found I got quite attached to everyone, and stayed up way too late to make sure they were all okay. SO excited about the finale of Crash Course in Romance this weekend! What to watch in the meantime?",

Check. \n\nThe plot also seemed to be settling into the usual sageuk politics/intrigue as well which is just super meh to me. It was my mistake admittedly. I shouldn't have wasted 5 hours of my life expecting any sageuk to be devoid of the usual sageuk BS. \n\nI was also laughing my ass off during the first episode as the characters' stories were unfolding.

Hye Mi really shined in this arc as a friend and I feel like these were some of the best scenes from Suzy in this drama -- the scenes that made me feel like she shouldn't be totally written off as an actress.\n\nWhat has surprised me is that despite being more than a decade later, I don't feel the drama has gotten extra cheesy or corny due to the time passed. Like it's about as corny and cheesy as when it first aired so while it feels dated from the production values, the corny/cheesy charm is still addictive as ever.",

Definitely made its way to my top 10 kdramas.\n\nThe pacing and cast was great, there weren't any unnecessary scenes and fillers. The characters were complex and I enjoyed watching every scene. The episodes were so unpredictable I caught myself holding my breathe for some of the scenes.\n\nEp 8 ending &gt;! when sang ah appeared and everything injoo experienced ended up being something that sang ah had planned from the start.... and Ep 12 when hwayoung appeared in the middle of the court hearing... damn  !&lt;\n\nBut I did wonder even if &gt;! hwayoung took up the identity of the dead lady, how did hwayoung go between Korea and Singapore when their biometrics would've been different? !&lt;\n\nI wonder if injoo regrets her decision to chase the money, &gt;! albeit started by trying to figure out the cause of hwayoung's death - whether she would've preferred living in the old house with her two other sisters and eating ice cream, or in the big apartment by herself, because the scene of her crying by herself in the apartment felt so sad and lonely. !&lt;\n\nAlso wi hajoon is such a hottie :&lt;\n\nI wish I watched it back then, would've definitely enjoyed the discussions on the theories.",

The three supporting characters are all awful people at the beginning, and the show just kind of skates right over that, with no real redemption, and we're supposed to care about them at the end...why? Male lead is fine. He gets one episode of back story, nothing further, just a few seconds here and there about stuff he did in the US. Ending was meh.\n\nBut damn, those outfits though... haha",

As I said on another thread, I  started this without reading any background other than the Netflix description. I thought - hey, only 8 episodes, and it's a totally different setting than what I usually watch. I can get through this no matter what. But surprisingly, it hooked me right away! \n\nThings I loved: With the exception of actress playing the center director, I was not familiar with any of the actors. That was refreshing. Also, I felt that every actor was perfect for his role - no criticisms about anyone - and that is not normal for me. In spite of it addressing a few serious topics, the mood was upbeat and it had me laughing constantly. I normally don't like over-the-top pushy funny and I was afraid early on that it might go in that direction, but it didn't. Overall, watching this was an enjoyable experience, a break from the mood of what I normally watch. \n\nStarted **Mr. Sunshine (4/24).**  Again, haven't really read much about this, just saw it mentioned a lot. In contrast to *Birthcare Center*, where I didn't know the actors, I feel like I know every single featured actor here. The only other historical drama I've watched is *Under the Queen's Umbrella* and I enjoyed that a lot. Obviously, this is very different. My first reaction is that I wish it was more clear about what is going on. I'm a bit lost, as is my husband. I resorted to reading up on Korean history but I think it might help to read some dramabeans recaps. I appreciate the look and feel of this and the acting seems really good. I will keep watching and hopefully it will become easier to understand as it goes on.",

I usually prefer to binge long kdramas so I can skip the break up episodes, but this one caught me. \n\nAlso watching 2 C dramas:\n\n**Love of Replica** which is the story of one twin taking the place of the other. Also romance happening.\n\n**The Love you give** Chemistry between ex lovers and it has the sweetest little boy. \n\nI have watched several C dramas now and often find that they are a more relaxing and gentler watch. Often good cinematography. There are the exceptions.",

But now I'm near to finishing the last 3 episodes of HP2, so I'll be able to move on. I know I'm \"late to the party\" on this drama, so I'm reading the threads about it, dramabeans, and watching all of the youtube videos. I'm learning the songs and telling friends \"Gwechana jal dol geoya\" when they tell me their troubles. HP2 has shot up my Favorites List to the Top 6 of All Time for me (out of 125). It's just filled with wonderful characters who are kind, caring, people, wonderful surgeons and teachers, and wonderful examples of friendship. They know how to have fun with each other. And they play music! For me, this is a perfect drama. And there is no noticeable \"comic book villain.\" There are a few flawed humans, but the main antagonist is illness. The entire OST is wonderful. Even the surgeries are interesting. I think I'll need to wait a while before watching Doctor Romantic, even though I'd love to see it. I just can't imagine getting into another hospital drama right now.\n\n**Gu Family Book-** I'm still watching this with my long-distance kdrama-watching friend. We've both gotten busy with RL so we can only watch 1 or 2 episodes each week and this is a long one. For me, a rewatch. But this is a wonderful Tale and we are both enjoying it. \n\nVery excited about the upcoming dramas!  **The Good Bad Mother**  begins today! And there are a few others that will begin in the next week or so with some of my favorite actors. All is well in kdramaland.",

The plot never feels like it's dragging out and I think some of that has to do with the nature of the show (horror) and some of that has to do with it only being 12 episodes. Jo Woo Jin is especially good in this and even after 9 episodes I still can't get a full read on his character. I also need Park Hyung Sik and Han Hyo Joo to reunite in another show because their chemistry is excellent. (I know that's a pipe dream!)\n\nNot sure what to start next. I have a very long list, but I am very much a \"mood watcher\" - there are things I will not enjoy unless I'm in the mood.

            "comment": "Just finished **Let\u2019s Eat Season 2 (18/18) and 3 (14/14).**  For two series in the same franchise they have pretty big differences. S2 feels like a standard romcom (sorry, I\u2019ll pretend that thriller subplot never happened, it felt so pointless) while S3 feels like a healing drama. Yet to watch S1 but I guess it\u2019s only the mukbang sessions that really tie the seasons together.\n\nThe different female lead per season is quite an interesting approach. It feels like a *Boyhood*-style biography where we follow Goo Dae-young\u2019s entire adult life as he grows older, including the places he moves to and the romantic partners he\u2019s had. The change in tone between seasons helps reinforce the \u201cgrowing up\u201d feel too; In S2 he was young and reckless and would take risks for his goals in life and love, hence the playful romcom. While in S3 he starts as someone playing it safe in life while he deals with loss, turning into a healing drama.\n\nOne thing I wish I didn\u2019t realize was that &gt;!Soo-ji was only really happy for a year, since she was a *hikikomori* for a majority of her life. Her death left me feeling hollow and sad, wishing she could\u2019ve made up for those years by being happy with Dae-young for the rest of her life.!&lt; But I think this also made the healing drama shift in S3 a perfect move. And while Soo-ji was the more charming FL, Ji-woo is endgame material for Dae-young. They have pretty good chemistry, and taking care of each other seems like second nature to them both.\n\nNon-Korean: Almost done with season 2 of **Suits**. Very educational since I have barely any knowledge about law stuff \ud83d\ude05 and the relationships between the characters are entertaining.",

I did read on some thread that you shouldn\u2019t try to binge this one bc the eps are so long and the 20-episode length, so I\u2019ve been leaning into that, watching it slowly has been good. \n\nSummer Strike (9/12). I need to finish this one already. It\u2019s a little too dull for me. I usually love Im Siwan, but I\u2019m not feeling compelled by either of our two leads. I\u2019ll finish it since I\u2019m so close. The high schooler side couple is cute. I hope we get a happy ending for everyone &gt;!except our sweet grandma :,( when Bom asked her to wash her shoes, I was like alright here we go, bye bye granny it\u2019s your time lol!&lt;\n\nEighth Sense (8/10). aghhh this show. I will be so sad when it\u2019s over. Loving it so so much. The gif sets on tumblr of it are beautiful if you feel like reliving some of it without rewatching haha. \n\nTo My Star 2 (9/10). I heard mumblings that the second season wasn\u2019t as good, so I had put it off for a while, but then some people still enjoyed it. Overall, it\u2019s still quite as good as S1 to me. There is some dialogue where I\u2019m like I have no idea what this means. Like they\u2019ll have an argument where I can\u2019t recognize it\u2019s an argument without their body language and facial expressions because I can\u2019t see how that dialogue would mean what they mean. But other than that, it\u2019s been nice seeing these characters again. If you haven\u2019t seen the BTS for S1, it is really worth a watch\u2014Son Woohyun (who plays Kang Seo Joon) is such a great vj, he\u2019s all \u201cTo My Star fighting!~\u201d you can really tell he is passionate about this show.",

The whole thing blew up when Dan Dan found out her father and birth mother were \u2018conniving\u2019 to get her away from the Chairman and over to the U.S. Really good acting by all over this highly emotion segment. I feel sorry for Ms Kim who is trying to make amends, and Dan Dan\u2019s poor father who seems overly against the Chairman in my opinion. Dan Dan is twenty seven, twenty seven is not too young in the West. Also the fact he has children is nothing if you have the \u2018where with all\u2019 to look after them which he does. So I don\u2019t understand Dan Dan\u2019s father on this. \nSo a few episodes left and I hope things get sorted out. Ms Jo has decided she is pregnant with the Chairman\u2019s baby! A simple D.N.A. test should sort that out methinks! Everyone needs to calm down. Sayeon ( Chairman\u2019s sister) is thrilled to bits as she has landed Dan Dan\u2019s step brother.? What a nice girl she is.",

Just too long, less eps would have made this much better;\n\n\\- **Joseon Attorney (8/16):** while the romance part feels a bit out of nowhere it does the job and the ML is quite the character, albeit I wish I could say the same about the FL. Acting is solid, storylines are easy to follow, scenario and costumes a plus. Not always on point, but a nice series overall.\n\nI'm having trouble adding new dramas to the watchlist after **Taxi Driver 2**, this season not appealing much to my taste.",

I'm glad I watched it, it was very good!\n\nI also watched a J-drama called Hold My Hand at Twilight which was a very cute slice-of-life fated-love-themed short series that was a nice easy watch, and the Korean movie remake of Soulmate which reminded me a lot of 20th Century Girl (not just because Byeon Woo-seok is also in it)... It was equally as gut-wrenching as 20th Century Girl too but at least &gt;!Woo-seok's character didn't die this time!&lt; lol.\n\nNow I'm binge-watching Till the End of the Moon (it's a Chinese Xianxia drama) and it's so effin' good! I highly recommend watching it, it's 40 episodes long but it rarely drags and the ML's acting skills are incredible!\n\nThat aside, at some point I need to go back and watch the second half of YOU season 4, tbh they probably should've left it at 3 seasons the plotlines are starting to become too far-fetched. There are only so many times you can watch Joe Goldberg stalk his latest girlfriend, kill all her friends, and then kill her off too, rinse and repeat.\n\nNow I'm just waiting for Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938 to start releasing episodes. In the meantime, I might try watching True Beauty (even though it's a high school drama lol).",

I don't know if I will continue if it doesn't deliver on the swoon front.\n\nI have picked up Oasis again I think. It veers from interesting to not so interesting so I am not super engaged.\n\nReally nothing that's gripping me too much.\n\nI rewatched Kotaro Lives Alone in English. And the dubbing is spot on esp for Kotaro's character. Such a wonderful anime, heart-warming and heart-breaking at the same time. The writing is so good.",

Some crazy moments happened that were good, and the FLs are suuuuch great actresses. It shows that they've been in this industry for a long time. Their chemistry is great, too. Other than that, it bored me. 4/10.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Romance is a Bonus Book (10/16)** \u2014 Didn't watch much this week, just 2 episodes, but I'm really loving this drama so far, It's so cute. I can't stop looking at Wi Ha Joon, either. \n* **Joseon Attorney: A Morality (8/16)** \u2014 This week solidified that I love this drama (so far ... I hope they keep up the pace). Each time, the drama gets better and now we've gotten to a point where I'm excited. It's more serious now than the beginning of the drama. There's still comedy, but it's of a lesser frequency than before. Han Su and Yeon Ju, so cute. They're adorable and I just want them to be happy.",

It had very little substance, was somewhat repetative, and the FL became very frustrating and infuriating, at times--although it was somewhat likeable in parts, if only it had been consistent all the way through.\n\nI've, almost exclusively, been watching Kdramas and BL series for 3-4 years, now, but have recently started expanding to Jdramas, (they're all really short): the best of the bunch being-- Don't Call It Mystery; My Right Older Brother; The Killer Inside; On A Starry Night; and Silent (which I REALLY LOVED!)-- and a Cdrama that I really enjoyed, The Forbidden Flower, (because, unlike most Cdramas it wasn't 52 episodes, (or more)--it was, actually a rather short 24--45 min. eps.).\n\nIt's good to branch out.\n\nIf anyone has any really excellent Jdramas or Cdramas to suggest. Please do!",

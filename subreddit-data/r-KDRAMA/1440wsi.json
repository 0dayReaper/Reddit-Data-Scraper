And at the beginning of my journey I wanted to check out the Korean drama focused services in Viki and Kocowa just to see what they were about. And I basically just looked at the front page, saw that you could watch a few free episodes of a show and then you had to pay a membership for the rest of the episodes. And I had so many new shows available to me on Netflix at the time that I didn't do much digging and left thinking i'll check it out later. Fast forward to two weeks ago and I'm googling about **Descendants of The Sun**, because I had watched the Chinese version on YouTube, and by some miracle I decide to click the Viki link for **DOTS** and my Korean drama world has been changed forever. Viki has a huge amount of entire dramas for **FREE**!!**AND THEY'RE RECENT AND GOOD DRAMAS,AGAIN FOR FREE!!**. My \"Dramas I'd Like To Watch\" list is now looking like swiss cheese.\n\nSo yeah i'll out myself as the Korean Drama noob just to inform others of this amazing platform. Enjoy! (This is not a PPL btw :) )",

I'll most likely pay for a pass in order to avoid ads, and I know I won't be able to finish during the timeframe of a free pass.",

It's a gripping slow burn that's tastefully done with amazing cinematography. ML's acting is also so fitting. \n\nEven though I couldn't watch the first ep and had frustrated-annoyed feelings about FL in the first few eps, I couldn't let go of my curiosity on whether it would be a train wreck or if everything will be okay for Dongjin and the siblings. \n\nThis show defines melo but with actual funny witty lines. I don't know if there's a show that can top this one in 2023.",

            "comment": "After a *long* drama slump, I somehow got back into the swing of things with **Stairway to Heaven**. And not only that, I managed to binge the entire show in two days \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nHere are just some of my notes (I think I may have gone a bit crazy during my binge, I'm hearing Gregorian chants everywhere lol)\n\n-The OST is pure crack, legit one of the only reasons I stuck around. Looking fondly? Boring. Looking fondly with *dramatic music*? Priceless. \n\n -It's been a while since I've watched a pre 2010 show, with this show being the oldest drama I watched yet, but damn, can these boys keep their hands to themselves. Like I had the same issue with BOF, like let the damn FL walk on her own, &gt;!like she's not blind...oh wait, nvm!&lt;\n\n- For most shows I've watched, the pattern usually goes: EP 1-6 amazing, EP 7-12 eh, big plotwist, and EP 12-__ conclusive ending. Can't believe that same pattern applies to old shows too. \n\n-Also speaking of the earlier episodes, wtf was that cast change. Like sure, I get the time skip, but all the actors look like they're 30, these guys are *not* in high school/college. It was only after the 2nd time skip that I was like \"Sure, I guess I can make this work now in my mind\"\n\n-Also, what's with the incest plot. Like I know **Piano** has a similar storyline and I'm here like??? What happened in early 2000s Korea??? (Also complete tangent, I wonder if that affected sibling relationships. Like I know in the US the whole \"step bro\" thing made a lot of actual step siblings feel uncomfortable, but it's such a common place meme now that it's part of the culture. Wonder if siblings back then had to go through the same thing with all these subplots). But ngl, the ML was such a prick most of the time, I was actually rooting for the brother, so idk what that says about me lol\n\nAnyways, I'll fight the urge to go to the carnival beach boardwalk that's like 30 min away from where I live and blast the OST. I'm probably gonna watch **Love in Bali** after this, or maybe continue the pattern with **Piano** lol.",

            "comment": "Last night I experienced the strongest tonal shift ever while finishing both **Her Private Life** and **Somebody**.\n\n**Her Private Life** \nIt was a good premise that lost steam (it got real boring) after episode 9. Kim Jae Wook and Park Min Young had AMAZING chemistry! If you told me those two were dating irl I would believe you. They were wasted in this show. I don't like fluffy romances but I gave this a chance cause it started off so damn cute. It takes a great skill level in writing to have a show remain interesting after the leads confess and are openly dating. The storyline was so flimsy/dull in the second half of the show. I skipped 3 episodes during my lunchbreak and didn't missed a thing. I think I'm going to bite the bullet and power through **Love To Hate You** while I work this time. Its gotta be better than HPL.\n\n **Somebody** \nI have a new OST to look up cause damn this show sounded so good. Kim Young Kwang played the creepiest character in kdrama history with that smile of his. That scene with him sprinting out of the back alley restaurant??? Christ.\n\nThis show managed to split my brain into two arguments:\n\n**A.**\nCinematic. Genius. Wonderfully weird. Well acted. It reminded me of my teenage years when I was obsessed with Japanese horror/real odd indie stuff. Books by Ryu Murakami and that TV show Eerie (which was more cohesive). It all left that same strange knot in my chest when it was over.\n\n**B.**\nThe storyline was rather flawed. The cop was stupid af. It felt like this was a smart film student's sexually repressed fantasy and they were more than willing to paint people with autism in a bad light for the sake of art.\n\nI say all this to say, I actually liked it. It's not perfect by any means but it was well done-setting aside my nitpicks.",

So I\u2019ve been pretty hardcore this year!!  But the last few weeks\u2026. Maybe I\u2019ve watched all the best ones?  Or starting to get bored of the same cliches in each romance?  I dunno\u2026..   I need more heavy ones like My Mister and Call it Love.",

Take you out of kdrama heavy. \n\n- misaeng (2014ish) office setting. Guy gets picked on by others because they believed he didn\u2019t belong. He works hard to disproves them, but really has no other choice. \n\n- mr sunshine (2018ish): little slave boy escapes to America after something horrible happens to his parents. Comes back as an American military guy slightly before the Japanese occupation. Do not read spoilers. \n\n- move to heaven (2021): young man with autism is forced to live with his uncle while running the family cleaning business. But they clean up spaces after people have died. \n\nTrust me. There are tons of really good ones out there. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ve watched them all if you\u2019ve only seen 60. I started during covid so was able to knock out a lot of them during that first year (about 90). I\u2019m still discovering new ones that has just dropped recently and old ones even though I hate watching anything prior to 2014. I\u2019m up to about 170 now since winter of 2020. I had to slow down a bunch because I had to go back to work. \n\nBranch out of romance. That might help.",

He might make more moves.\n\nAnd what was with that confrontation between Dr Roy and In Ho.. does In Ho think he is  very moral ? \n\nTo remind you Mr Cheater, Dr Roy hasn't made any move on Dr cha for the time being and he is just concerned abt Dr cha. Also, Dr Roy got to know how you treat your wife so badly during liver transplant and that was when he probably started thinking abt Dr Cha. He knows you are a cheap person and he just wanted to be there for Dr Cha during her emotional times and he wanted to be a friend of Dr Cha. \n\nAlso, did you forget, he didn't even tell Dr Cha abt your affair ( though i think it was wrong). If he wanted to break a family, he would have told long ago. He never wanted to hurt Dr Cha.. so Mr cheater.. you better keep your lessons of morality to yourself. \n\nHe is not comparable to you .

I also love how her son is coming into his own and becoming more confident in his interactions with his dad and his GF/ex-GF.\n\nI saw in the preview for ep. 12 that Jeongsuk says she wants a divorce. Finally!! I hope it's near the beginning of the episode. Enough waffling.\n\nIt's interesting to see how Jeongsuk's close female relationships are all pushing her to stay - mother last week, best friend this week, etc. I wonder if that is reflective of Korean culture? I can't imagine she will stay in the marriage; her husband is so totally without merit as a character that even them coexisting as still legally husband/wife but living separately is repulsive to me.",

In india marriage is a thing that is seen as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If there's a problem in the marriage divorce is always at the bottom of the list of solution that many don't even think of. Issues of a cheating and abusive husband isn't seen as a big problem (thankfully this mentality is slowly changing) and the wife is always told to pay it no mind. \"It's a man so it's not a big deal.\" \"You're his wife and a mother, what will you do without him!\" \"What will the society say?!\" Is a common phrase.\n \nIn the context of the drama to the other characters it may feel like that Jong-suk is a middle-aged woman who's recently had a liver transplant and hence is weak and can't live alone in this age and condition. She's also been married to him for 20 years and leaving him now would seem pointless to many.\n\nIt may seem unfair to her and it is but I'm kinda glad that they are showing this side of the society that actively pushes and denies the women's feelings and pride aside for the sake of the family's appearance and to save their faces in front of the society.\n\nI hope that Jong-suk realises that this marriage is leading them both nowhere and she goes against the societal norms and stands up for herself and leads a happy life without her coward husband (Irrespective of the fact whether Dr Roy ends with her or not)\n\nSide note:- Doctor Cha awfully reminds me of the Hindi drama Anupama which also has a similar plot (but worse).",

I expected her mother to give the kind of advice she did but her friend telling her the same was a disappointment for sure. How long are we gonna expect women to stay in a marriage where the husbands are lost cause because they have kids together? Before a mother, wife, daughter in law etc, she is a human being who gets hurt, feels pain. All that she has to keep aside because oh her kids will suffer. BS! Also by being in such marriage, arent the kids getting influenced the wrong way? Arent they getting the idea that its ok to cheat because you will always be forgiven? I would hate for my kids to believe that cheating or being cheated on is okay. No its not! Its the worst form of betrayal and disrespect to give or receive.\n\n I would really love it if the show ends with Dr.Cha divorcing In Ho. He is beyond redemption at this point. I am ok with her not ending up with Dr.Roy either (though I really like their equation so far). I want this amazing woman to realize what a gem she is! This kind of ending will also give out the right message that none deserves to be in a toxic relationship/marriage and its ok to end it if its beyond repair.",

A broken family unit or the threat of it would be just be the awful cherry on top for both of these kids, especially as none of it is either of their faults but they still have to live with the trauma of their parents' shitty decisions :(",

By staying married Cha wins since he'll have to write in his mistress &amp; love child in his will but as the wife she can overrule or adjust what they get since she is still his legal wife &amp; can handle his affairs. By divorcing, they win. \n\nEven if it was a one night stand that created a love child, they still had an affair for over 3 yrs in Korea. Not to mention how long the residency took in Chicago. They were probably together the entire time &amp; she got pregnant at the end when he left to come back home. \n\nI'm not sure how the rules regarding wills are in Korea, but in the US, the legal wife can contest the will, especially if there is a case where the will \"takes care\" of the mistress and love child over the wife &amp; legal children. Her staying married but separated might work out in the long run. \n\nImo, I would divorce and move on away from their toxicity, but I can see the appeal of staying married for the final revenge/win against the mistress.",

It seems she feels like the life that was rightfully hers was stolen from her.  And it's that she is hanging on to and desperate to fix.  In her mind, they were fated to be together (a very common theme in K-dramas), and she never got over losing the life she considered to be hers.   This makes more sense than some deep connection or love.  And it explains why she is hanging on to, let's be frank, a man that is not especially desirable by most measures, apart from being wealthy and respectable.  \n\nIt makes me wonder if her daughter's conception was really an accident.  Maybe she thought that having his child would bring him back to her, in the same way he was lost to her.\n\nMaybe seeing him trying to &gt;!backstab her,!&lt; will start to change her mind.",

TLDR; show drives me insane, lots of cursing\n\ni understand how social norms in SK can be different and how divorce might seem relatively easier in Western cultures, but i am truly unable to accept anyone condoning infidelity for any spouse.\n\ni truly don't think im joking when i say this show could truly make me go criminally insane. &gt;!how the fuck is it that the only person encouraging a divorce be the woman her husband had an affair with?! and not even for Dr Cha's benefit! WTF! Dr Cha has some super unsupportive people in her life ffs. Her friend is saying some super crazy bullshit about \"enduring\", her children did not apologize for keeping such a terrible secret from her, and even her mom was spewing the same shit as her friend (i doubt her stance would change even if she knew the truth).!&lt;\n\nit is truly fucking true that when u try to break the status quo, the people around you will not support it if it disrupts their lives alongside yours. fucking hell.\n\ni know a lot of people are saying the comedic effect they're using the husband for is growing on them, but good lord it irks me to the bone?? i feel like i could burn this man alive?? how dare they try to lighten his infidelity and cruelty to his wife with comedy?? are the writers secretly misogynists?? make him act like he actually cares about his wife when he literally only cares about himself?? he doesn't even RESPECT her. which is the bare fucking minimum in a loveless marriage. this fucking narcissist probably blames her for getting pregnant, that they had to get married and he to break up with the girlfriend. i truly. cannot. it makes me so livid.\n\nthe second female lead. is truly. so fucking dumb. i would've thought that a doctor would come to realize at her big fucking age that for Dr Cha to have gotten pregnant, her boyfriend was fucking cheating on her. and how can she STILL be mad about something that happened when they were young and stupid. she could've moved on with someone better! and the fact that she blames her daughter's unhappiness on somebody else?? wow she and ML are perfect for each other, these stupid narcissists!\n\n&gt;!if this preview is to be believed, Dr Cha will prepare to initiate divorce by episode 13. if she doesn't, there is truly something wrong with whoever the fuck greenlit this fuckass storyline. !&lt;\n\n/rant over",

We saw that she was angry and shocked by the whole discovery. But I think she is the one who knows Doctor Cha the best and knows how hard it is for her to break ties and she told her at the brink of everything - no one expects anything from you. Do what's best for you, whether it's breaking up the marriage or whether it's staying in it. And anyway I'll be there for you. That's how I saw it anyway. (Many times there is pressure to tell the betrayed party - leave him right now, get a divorce, etc.. when in fact the betrayed party is not yet completely sure what he or she wants). And here she told her - do what is good for you  \nAnd as for the son's girl friend, the fact that she came with her to stay the night with Dr. Roy was really touching. I'm sure she had a bed in a staff room (she just got out of there) and was just doing it to make Doctor Cha feel comfortable.  \nShe did more for Doctor Cha in a short time than her children, who did not apologize at all for hiding her husband's terrible lie from her, but more than that, they also did not have any deep or meaningful conversation with her about this whole thing. Not that long conversations are necessary, but even the conversation of the son's girlfriend in the dormitory was much more significant than the non-existent conversation with the daughter and the son.",

No self respecting woman would stick around in that marriage. There is no reason for her to stick around.\nThe children are both practically adults. Dr Cha can be financially independent even without the building. When the story comes out about the second family no one would blame Dr Cha for leaving his sorry ass.\n\nDr Cha is hitting average nationwide rating of 18%, the 4th highest in JTBC history, so it's very popular in Korea. Given that some people are commenting here that in Korea divorce carries a stigma, especially for women, does anyone know what the Korean netizens are saying about this on any chat forums? Are they too getting annoyed that Dr Cha is wavering about kicking his sorry ass to the curb?",

In that moment, you can feel Jung-min thinking that maybe this life isn't so bad.\n\nEven though being a doctor isn't his passion, I really feel that Jung-min would have performed better had he been doing his residency in a different environment, in a place he was not trampled down constantly. A place like Yulje. Imagine Lee Ik-jun as his mentor instead of Seo In-ho.

That and years of watching kdramas and learning about Korean culture.\n\nI looked up Korean divorce laws last week. Here\u2019s a guide meant for non-Koreans:  https://seoullawgroup.com/divorce-korea/\n\nNotice that abuse by in-laws is legal grounds for divorce, which certainly fits with everything I have seen about in-laws in Korean culture. Also if you watch historicals, you\u2019ll learn it was very easy for a man to divorce his wife in Joseon but the wife had barely any recourse herself, and a divorced woman had lower social status than butchers. One of the reasons a man could divorce his wife in Joseon was if she displayed jealousy towards his concubines or his visits to the gisaeng house.\n\nJoseon only ended with the Japanese occupation in the early years of last century. It takes a lot of time for a culture to change.\n\nAlso personally my marriage is extremely happy, but if it wasn\u2019t and then I found out about an affair and a kid - I couldn\u2019t just up and leave. I have spent over half the time I\u2019ve been alive with my husband. It would be incredibly hard and it would take a long time and it would be a huge emotional struggle. Although my mother has always made it clear that I could come back home if I had to, so there\u2019s that at least, and Dr. Cha\u2019s mother seems supportive of her too.",

Think about it - he has been rejecting the idea of divorcing his wife because that would mean exposing his affair &amp; second family to his wife &amp; family members, and it would also take a hit on his job as a hospital professor. But we all know that he has too much of an ego to blow all of that away\u2026 Korea also does not have a no-fault divorce, so the wife would eventually be the one who divorces him anyways and she\u2019ll have the upper hand (since it\u2019s weird to just bring up your wrongdoings after 15+ years). I\u2019m guessing the husband will just be putting on an act in this episode (as seen from the preview) to behave like he\u2019s all that and has \u2018power\u2019 over the two female leads when he\u2019s the one on the losing end (since Dr. Cha might be able to receive some money/assets).",

Equating her affair to Jeong-suk's \"affair\" (wouldn't even call it that) is absurd; it's like part of her stayed stuck in that moment of betrayal and never matured past it. Worse, she still blames/wants to punish Jeong-suk, rather than the person who actually betrayed her trust. Also does anyone else think &gt;!Seung-hi started that fire in the dorms?!&lt;\n\nI refuse to believe this show is setting up Jeong-suk and In-ho to stay together; even without the affair their marriage was devoid of affection, their kids are grown, Jeong-suk has her own career now, and she also has that building under her name.

Like ok I get the social stigma in a conservative country like Korea on divorce.  Esp since he's not technically \"abusing\" her.  But dude emotional and financial abuse are still abuses. If my friend was going thru this, instead of telling her what to do, I'd be saying whatever you choose I will stand by you.  If you divorce him, it's gonna be hard, but don't you worry at all, I'm here for you.  Don't tell her it's too hard to get divorced, you'll be unhappy.  How about, you deserve to be loved and adored and while yes the stigma is high but who cares when you have supportive family, supportive friends, and you can find a lover who truly cares for you. \n\nWhich goes into part 2. \n\n2. Dude she hasn't slept with her husband in 10 years.  She's 47. That means she hasn't had any sex since she was 37. That's too young to basically be living the life of a widow (her husband just so happens to be alive that's all). And basically he checked out 10 years ago.  They are essentially divorced.  She just didn't know it yet.  TEN YEARS! How do you not have an inkling after ten dry years.  \n\n3. Inho doesn't want to get divorced. Why? Because you love her? Or you miss the status quo? Because you care about your marriage? Or you care more about your reputation? Or having a live in maid? Or a free nanny? Or a caregiver to your mom? Or because you see her as your possession and don't wanna share? Cuz let me tell you buddy that ain't love. \"I don't wanna get a divorce.\" Well let me tell you buddy in the end it won't be up to you to decide, you coward. Eat your cake while you still can.\n\n4. The audacity of the AP. Yeah FL stole him away. But you know what two wrongs doesn't make it right. Instead of becoming a mistress you could have lived your life to the fullest.  Because a life well lived is the best revenge. Instead you chose to have an affair with a married man. You chose to have his baby. You chose to let your baby live the life of mistress's child, living with that hurt and stigma knowing she will never get the happy family experience, and will live always in the shadow of his other family. You did that. You hurt your child.  \n\n5. If I was the friend, I'd go to the hospital lobby and wait for AP and slap her in front of the whole hospital. And loudly tell everyone she is a mistress and tell her, \"this is the life you chose, a mistress's life. To live in continual shame. Whenever someone side eyes you, or talks about you behind your back, I want you to remember this slap, because they are slapping you a hundred, a thousand times already in their mind. This, this is the life you chose.\" Mic drop and leave. Like legit I would bring a microphone just to do that. \n\nAnd don't think I'd stop there. Only out of respect to my friend's reputation, I'll wait until her husband is at home and id slap him there.  Then tell him to expect me every night he's home.  And if he tries to stop me, well don't make me burn that bridge.",

After that incident, I cannot help but wonder if he'll continue in the medical field? Since his sister did mention he initially wanted to pursue comms but 'cuz of his dad etc didn't end up doing so. Idk, I just rly want to see him happy. Also,  I did find his interaction with Sora touching, the whole &gt;! \"stay by your side\" etc; !&lt; I know she's not rly liked by a lot of people? (from what I've seen online?) but tbh i do think her character has potential, and imo, she isn't that bad-- while she isn't rly the main character, i do kinda hope to see her have an emotional moment? idk man, i just feel like there's so much nuance to her and areas to unpack, but i digress \n\nNext, like most of the sentiments here, i really do hope dr cha goes forth with the divorce, but the direction of the recent episodes so far makes me doubt that they'll have that ending which is quite frustrating. Because even if she does forgive her husband--how are they even going to wrap it up cleanly with the little remaining episodes left?? Like, that man did so much horrible things to her, they need at least 100 episodes to show him repenting for them man. And even if they do, it honestly doesn't rly seem like her husband has any romantic feelings for her-- as he said before, &gt;!  it's mostly bc he relied on her or smth that made him want to stay?? idk man but either way that's..... !&lt; ultimately, it's just not fair to dr cha :(( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirdly, I kinda hope for more sibling interactions between I-rang and Jung-Min? I feel like it'd be quite interesting/heartwarming to see them interact or comfort each other since their parents (in extension, family) situation is at a rocky place rn and evidently, it is having an effect on their well-being, grades etc. Though, kinda doubt it'll happen :/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForuthlyyy, about Dr Roy,  i wonder what he meant when he &gt;! approached the parents of the late patiet and said he wanted to explain to them how their daughter passed away?? like, is he going to take responsibility or smth?? i have ZERO medical knowledge, so idk if him asking for that biopsy in the middle of the procedure was considered risky???? I did see him carry a file in that scene, tho i have no clue what its abt-- perhaps a detailed report?? who knows. !&lt;  also, i wonder what he said to dr cha's bff lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I've seen people speculating that dr roy might be dr cha's sibling or smth-- i really hope that's not the case. They don't even have to end up tgt,,, i just feel like if the writers use that as a reason to push for the romance/reconciliation between dr cha and her husband... idk, feels like lazy writing imo. i really hope that doesn't happen.\n\nanyway, can't wait to see how this drama ends, im really manifesting it won't be too frustrating..",

            "comment": "Seeing how no one is encouraging Dr. Cha to get a divorce except the SFL, it totally relates to what I've seen around myself. People continue living on as if nothing happened, but the person who gets cheated starts living with doubt, undermining themselves, being paranoid about even the small little things that didn't matter before. \n\n\"Love lasts forever\" he says, the nerve of this piece of-, but when you betray that love, do you really expect it to hold for as long as you live? Even if Dr. Cha continues to live with her husband and family, the affair is going to haunt her every single day of her life. That is too painful, trust me. She is very forgiving, that is true. Maybe because she's a mother she understands why her kids never said anything, I still think that by lying to their mother and keeping her in the dark they committed an equally wrongful deed as their father. \n\nDr. Cha is really really lucky that she found out about her husband's affair, if not she would have been gaslighted her entire life whenever she had any suspicions or doubts regarding his faithfulness. Since she knows, she can now take a stance on her own. But seeing how KDramas play out, I would be really surprised if she gets a divorce, I just don't see it happening for some reason. \n\nThat hug between her and her sister though, that was &lt;3 heartwarming. When your world turns upside down, your family is supposed to get you through it, notice how none of the kids apologised to her, or consoled her or even hugged her. Forget them, even her husband hasn't apologised sincerely yet, he proudly keeps his head up as if he did nothing wrong, there is no regret in his actions or behaviour. \n\nDr. Roy being a gentleman through and through, lending his place for the residents to stay, rescuing her from the fire and still handing her over to her husband, he knows he cannot step over the line but he definitely cares a lot. But his ship with Dr. Cha, I'm hopeful but maybe I'm not.",

But I think that fundamentally, he is selfish, weak and lacks any modicum of courage.  He's not a bad person, per se, although because of his weak character he ends up doing bad things.\n\nHe allowed himself to give in to impulse on at least two occasions, and that's how his son and daughter were conceived.  On both occasions, he was cheating.\n\nWhen his wife needed a liver donor, he knew it was the right thing to do, but kept letting other people influence him.\n\nWhen she started doing her residency, it inconvenienced him and his mistress so he tried to convince her to quit.\n\nHe might have loved his wife once but has grown complacent over the years.  When his first love showed up in Korea, I think she was the one who pushed for a relationship and he was too weak-willed to resist.  When he started to get some competition for his wife's affection he realized what he might be losing.  It's when you might lose something that you start to appreciate it.\n\nSo he's not some evil mastermind, but a man with narcissistic tendencies with no backbone whatsoever.\n\nI still want Doctor Cha to divorce his ass.   Her friend asked the question we are all wondering.  What the hell is it about this guy that makes him desirable in any way shape or form?",

In all the episodes up to episode 12 she's done exactly what she said she was going to do even when it was difficult. Now that she's made up her mind, this is it. In-ho has regularly underestimated her determination and now is when he is going to find out. \n\nSueng-hee needs professional help with her obsession. It's not reasonable to expect your boyfriend from college to give you the life you thought you should have had 20+ years after you knew him. She should be focusing on her daughter before she goes completely off the rails. &gt;!That moment when En-seo said she can't compete with Yi-rang because of the injury to her arm paralleled Sueng-hee's obsession with In-ho. Now her daughter is as obsessed with destroying her half-sister as Sueng-hee is with taking the life she thinks Jong-suk stole from her in medical school. !&lt;\n\nHopefully, Sueng-hee gets professional help before things go any farther although I suspect both she and In-ho will have professional and personal consequences they didn't expect when they started sneaking around three years ago. \n\n&gt;!Just my guess but this lawsuit from the patient's death is most likely going to take them both down. Mi-keung's (Dr. Cha's mom) illness is going to be the final nail in Sueng-hee's career because if she has missed something there it will come back on her much worse with the additional context of the episode 12 patient death. Especially with In-ho so focused on shifting blame from his son. I also think this will be how the hospital administration finds out about In-ho and Sueng-hee's affair.  !&lt;I think Sueng-hee'll be forced to leave the hospital, her career in Korea in a shambles. In-ho's reputation will be his consequence. That and living alone with his mother who doesn't know how to cook or clean. Although, he could lose his job too - I think that's still an open possibility.\n\nI think In-ho and his mother with lose everything in the divorce. &gt;!Dr. Cha will quite rightly get half of the building her MIL put in her name and the other half will be the debt from the bad investment the MIL is surely making. I like to imagine them living in an efficiency getting on each other's nerves and fighting over whose turn it is to wash the dishes.!&lt;\n\nDr. Cha will land on her feet. In anything, her new life will be a LOT easier than the life she's lived up to now.\n\nI hope it works out for all the kids - even En-seo - because none of this was their fault or doing. Sure En-seo told everyone, but I get where she was coming from. She's desperate to get her mother's attention.\n\nI don't think Dr. Cha and Dr. Kim will end up together until the last five minutes. Maybe an open ending? I don't think Dr. Cha and Dr Kim are related but if Dr. Kim happens to be related to In-ho wouldn't that be comedy gold? I could see that...",

            "comment": "Episode 12's ending &gt;!divorce scene!&lt; is so well done in my opinion. The thing that brings her to her breaking point wasn't In Ho fighting Roy, Sung Hee harassing her or asking her to divorce her husband, or Eun Seos existence as a whole. It was &gt;!her husband using her disability pass, something she didnt want in the first place, something she got because of her near death experience. Taking advantage of her even when she almost died, something he didnt do anything about, to make driving around his mistress and himself a couple seconds easier.!&lt; She realizes how absurd it is that she let all these things slide by, something she wouldve let slide had he given her his liver, telling herself that &gt;!he should be able to use it as he is the one who \"saved her life\".!&lt; She blames everyone in this situation, from his mother who failed to raise him with morals, showcasing she herself has none by &gt;!complaining about doing the memorial for her deceased husband because she found a new lover, something she didnt want Jung Sook to do all because she wants someone to do everything around the house for her, rather than caring for her daughter in law who was cheated on. !&lt; , In Ho for &gt;!basically everything!&lt; , and herself for allowing everything to occur (I personally think, with Jung Sooks mother and best friend being as traditional as they are, somewhat made her feel as if staying was natural even with the circumstances). \n\nHowever, if they do end up together in the end, this entire tirade I went on would be the biggest cope ive done and I hope it doesnt happen.

While CJS was also wrong by hooking up with SIH in the past, she already paid the price for her mistake. CSH knowingly coveted a married man and continued to be in that relationship. She's not a victim. Why is she gaslighting CJS? I hate her guts so much.\n\nWhat if it turns out that &gt;!RK and SIH are half-brothers and have the same parent!&lt;?

It's her mom in the affair. \n\n**If CJS forgives SIH, I will drop this drama and lose it**. He hasn't even apologized for the affair. Now he's all acting jealous just because RK is giving CJS his attention and care. He didn't care for CJS before and now he becomes all possessive when someone might take her away from him.

She did sleep with In Seo knowing fully well that he was in a relationship with someone else, and she does deserve to be called out for that. I am glad she acknowledged it, even though the whole \"you looked at me harshly till we graduated\" doesn't really seem to be that big of a punishment lol. I'm glad she did acknowledge it, even though it could have been better.\n\nSo Ra's character development arc? Chef's kiss. \ud83e\udd0c\n\nPoor Seung-gi, that's all I can say for this woman. She's so misguided right now, and she only has her daughter. No one else is on her side, and she has to deal with all this bullshit. \n\nI have a strong feeling that Grandma's boyfriend&gt;!is a scammer lol. Let's see what happens. Would love to see both her and her son on the streets with not a penny to their name, and I have a strong suspicion that the Grandma will come crawling back to her \"beloved\" DIL.!&lt;\n\nThe scene where Dr Cha describes the exact moment she decides to &gt;!get a divorce!&lt; is so heart-breaking. I really hope she doesn't go back to this guy, she deserves so much better. SO, SO much better. \n\nI don't even want to talk about In Ho. He was right when &gt;!he said he \"relies\" on his wife.!&lt; That's all she is to him. Things would be tough to manage without her, and so he is clinging on to her and uses her.

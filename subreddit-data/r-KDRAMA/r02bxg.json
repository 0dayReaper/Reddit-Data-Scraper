I feel that actors should change this culture by not worrying over losing fans by sharing their relationships, but instead they should be open about their relationships and focus on their work because ultimately it\u2019s their work that gets noticed. I really like this about Hollywood, how actors are comfortable sharing parts of their lives with their fans, all the while focusing on their work primarily.",

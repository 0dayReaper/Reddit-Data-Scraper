I love it, but a lot of people are annoyed at it right now because it has a side story that's occupying a lot of time that not everyone is interested in. \n\nThe Glory is scary/has extremely graphic violence but I couldn't stop watching it, though wish I'd started watching it closer to March 10th.",

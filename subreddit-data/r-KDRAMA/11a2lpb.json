    "postText": "In my attempt to join the Shin-Lee fandom I started with **Hospital Playlist**(which has become very dear to me) and finished **Prison Playbook**. Loved them both so much so finally decided to watch **Reply** series. Although I see **Reply 1988** discourse all the time I can't say the same for the previous series of Reply. So I was hesitant but I finally did it. And boy it was so worth it! I ended up loving it so much that I'm in disbelief that the **Reply 1997** series hasn't been as popular among international kdrama fans as other dramas of its time when it has aged so beautifully unlike most of those dramas. I still regret watching this masterpiece so late! I wasn't sure of liking this at first since it relies heavily on nostalgia with the 1997 setting but with the right fansubbed translation the series could be enjoyed by everyone! \n\nThe series switches between the past at 1997 and the present at 2012. It's main protagonist is Sung Shi-won who is a crazy kpop fangirl and her gang which includes her childhood best friend Yoon Yoon-jae, another kpop fangirl Yoo-jung, nice guy Joon-hee, talkative Sung-jae and the late addition Hak-chan. It has four love tracks and three love triangles. It also has the very famous \"Who got married to whom\" storyline which piques the interest of audience. The show's writing is excellent because even after 12 eps it manages to keep you on hook about who the FL ends up with.\n\nMy most favourite thing about Hospital Playlist and Prison Playbook was the hearty laughs they gave me. Reply 1997 didn't disappoint me at all because even at its corny and slapstick moments it made me laugh so much. The goat sounds only made it better. Special shoutout to Sung Dong-il because I didn't have much of an impression of him in his HP cameo and even in Legend of the Blue Sea man was creepy. But him as a father was so endearing to watch esp when he saw all those kids as his own. Him along with Lee Il-hwa was one of the most amazing couples on kdramaworld.\n\nComing to the characters, I liked Jung Eun-ji as the FL very much. Having a loud personality it's easy to sound annoying but she played it very well. Couldn't believe that this was her debut. She was what Geum Jandi should've been. Innocent, charming and full of heart. \n\nThe first big surprise in Reply 1997 was Seo In-guk. This is my first drama of his and I was so taken aback by his acting chops. Be it as the brooding boy who is in love with his childhood best friend or the younger brother who had to sacrifice for his brother's sake, he was so amazing to watch. My heart sank every time he got his heart broken and swooned whenever he looked at the FL with lovetorn eyes. Shi-won is a better person than me because I'd have folded for his charms. Him finally kissing her as she counts still makes me giggle as I'm typing this.\n\nThe second big surprise was one of the main characters being &gt;!gay.!&lt; As someone who is annoyed by the constant homophobia in kdramas in the name of being funny I was so impressed by how a 2012 drama handled it much better than today's dramas.  When it was revealed that &gt;!Angel was not Shi-won or Yoo-jung but Yoon-jae's friend Joon-hee who is in love with him!&lt; I was shooketh. Kudos to the writer for actually giving the storyline a conclusion by &gt;!Yoon-jae getting to know the truth and still being good friends with Joon-hee who has now moved on!&lt;. \n\nThe storyline of the second couple Hakchan and Yoon-jung was hilariously cute. Hak-chan was already making me laugh so hard because he was the coolest guy until he was around girls but I adored how he comforted a heartbroken Yoon-jung reeling from rejection. The conclusion of their story was also fulfilling with Hak-chan surprising everyone by being there at her worst situation even though it's been years. Loved how he progressed as a better boyfriend by learning from his mistakes. He may have an addiction to adult movies but the only girl he loved was Yoon-jung. Confession: I didn't get the meta joke that the actor playing him was a Sechs Kies member himself until I finished the series but those who knew would've enjoyed it a lot. \n\nThe episodes in the beginning were just 30 mins long and as the series progressed it got longer and I could see it started being overindulgent. But I should know that by now since HosPlay and Prison Playbook also have this issue. It was a minor flaw though.\n\nAnd now to the major flaw. A series as beautiful as this SHOULDN'T have had that storyline of Shi-won's teacher asking her out. Yes, Tae-woong is Yoon-jae's brother so he knows Shi-won even before he was a teacher. I was so shocked when he told Yoon-jae that he was planning to ask her out as Inever saw it coming. Him saying that he has always looked at Shi-won as a woman didn't help his case either. It's a huge yikes and it was still yikes even if he had resigned before asking her out! I liked him as the brother figure but after that I really couldn't like him at all. It kept getting weirder when it was revealed that he was in love with Shi-won's dead sister. It looked almost incestuous and made me very uncomfortable. Even for 2012 standards this storyline was bad. So I hated it when they kept the game of \"Guess the husband\" going. Although Seo In-guk is the ML I was not sure since Reply 1988's ending got everyone upset. But thankfully the writer didn't let me down. Not a huge fan of childhood friends turned lovers trope but Shi-won and Yoon-jae have a very explosive chemistry and it only got better when they started dating. Such beautiful kisses that made me think why so many dramas of that period had fish kisses. \n\nLike I said before I'm still regretting why I watched this gem so late but it's never too late I guess. Wondering why this series hasn't had the same appreciation as 1988 and why Seo In-guk is still not as popular as the likes of fellow '87 liners like Ji Chang-wook or Lee Seung-gi. I will keep revisiting Reply 1997 scenes and snippets often and after some time I'll start Reply 1994 because Shin-Lee combo is truly one of the greatest kdrama combos!",

            "comment": "Honestly out of the three Reply series, 1997 was the most successful when it comes to evoking nostalgia for me. I can't quite explain it but in 1997 they really put all their effort into making an atmosphere/vibe for the era while the latter installments were much more chatacter and story focused. If the goal of the Reply series were evoking nostalgia then dare I say 1997 was the most successful.",

The lower budget and lack of experience of the actors (although they all did a great job, I'm not knocking them) contributes to the vibe. Everything feels very natural. \n\nThe main thing I didn't like is that Eun Jiwon looked to old for his role.",

It was super fun and resonated with a whole bunch of people and we all loved it a lot. They took cliffhangers to the next level with their mystery. Waiting for the next episode was torture. Good old days. I still remember that ost the two leads sang! It was so good. Unfortunately I\u2019ve never seen the FL in another drama. She was sooo fun to watch. \n\nI never thought any other Reply series could top it so I even put off 1988 for a long time but bruh. 1988 was even crazy amazing. I didn\u2019t know how they did it.  But regardless\u2014\u2014 1997 was definitely not slept on. Maybe 1988 is overshadowing it though, for good reason.\n\nEdit: something that\u2019s stopping me from going back to rewatch it is definitely that brother/teacher character. Hated that hahaha.",

So any references or jokes got lost on me. A Korean might prefer it to 1994 which can feel long and self indulgent.\n\nAnother reason is that the older brother is bland and creepy and can't didn't any support from me in the love triangle. The Shin-Lee team improved the quality of the love triangle as the Reply series progressed.\n\nI watched the Reply series in this order 1997 -&gt; 1988 -&gt; 1994 and liked them in the following order 1988, 1994 and 1997.\n\nIf you liked In Guk you should check him out in Shopping King Louie and The Smile Has Left Your Eyes",

The writing felt rougher in 97, the dialogue wasn't as good and plot was often inconsistent. \n\nTo give some examples, halfway through the show, Tae-woong goes from an ordinary teacher to a millionaire, with barely any explanation. In one episode he says he is the only employee, but in the next episode he has a team of staff (including a co-founder). Shi-won has a part-time job, but in only one episode, it's never mentioned in the rest of the show. The worst example by far is how Shi-won's sister is only mentioned once and in Tae-woong's flashback, not one from her family.\n\nI completely agree about the teacher, for me, he was the worst part of the show. Not only was it creepy for a teacher to try to date his student, but he also was incredibly bland with nothing interesting about his character. I probably wouldn't recommend the show just based on him, he dragged down an otherwise decent show so much.\n\nAlso, I struggled to accept actors in the 30s portraying teenagers, I mean they looked the same in the flashforwards and flashbacks.",

I kept flip-flopping the whole series LOL. Personally I enjoyed 1994 more than 1997 (seem most people liked the opposite).\n\nThe best thing from Shin-Lee combo is a lot of their rookie/young actors becomes (more) successful and famous after their dramas. Of course talent is important, but having a good storyline helps too! \n\nThey just did their mini youtube reunion of some sort and the PD said their budget for 1997 was very very low and he had rough time during filming since he did everything himself (shooting all day and editing the whole night). He said showering and sleeping was a luxury. LOL. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgI2vBvWQHI)",

Every episode kept my interest and I looked forward to each new episode. That\u2019s a compliment because I really don\u2019t care for high school or university kdrama. I also really don\u2019t like kdramas with lots of fighting and hitting.  I know it\u2019s a trope but it\u2019s one I dislike.  This series had a lot of fighting and hitting especially by Shi-won. Despite that, I still enjoyed it.  Oh wait\u2026&gt;! I found the older brother Tae-woong very creepy. He was too into young girls for his age. That he went for the little sister of his dead fianc\u00e9 was yucky. That he was going for Shi-won even after he found out Joon-jae had loved her for 8 years bothered me and that he was setting Joon-jae up on a blind date (regardless of how he tried to pass it off as something else) made me dislike him!!&lt; \n\nHey, what the the reason for the scenes with Tae-woong\u2019s disgusting bedroom with the dirty plates, used food containers, dirty clothes, etc.?  To show us his other side? His true self? Am I overthinking that scene?\n\nSome of the things I really appreciated:\n\nThe story is like an onion slowly peeling away layer after layer, revealing history, answers to questions, etc. It\u2019s in the last minute of the show that &gt;! I finally got an answer to how Joon-jae broke his arm!!&lt; I loved this kind of reverse engineering story telling. \n\nI really enjoyed the relationship between Shi-won\u2019s parents and Joon-Jae and Tae Woong. So natural. It was special. \n\nI also enjoyed all of the friends and their various stories and character development. Those kids were so much fun. So full of emotions and drama just like teenagers everywhere.  The \u201cgoat\u201d sound effect never got old. \n\nThe best acting for me was from Joon-jae. I\u2019ve never seen this actor before and he was excellent at each stage/age. &gt;! His declaration to Shi-won at the karaoke place broke my heart! The scenes between Joon-jae and Joon-hee from close high school friends to adult roommates were so well done and also broke my heart. Joon-hee\u2019s sexuality was handled and portrayed so well. What a beautiful relationship between those friends. The acting was perfection. !&lt;  Given my dislike of fighting, yelling and hitting, I wasn\u2019t a fan of Shi-won but because Joon-jae wanted her, I rooted for that. I don\u2019t think I want to see that actress again though. Ha ha! \n\nThanks to everyone, especially user invitrium, for encouraging me to watch the Reply series.  I will watch the next two in due course!",

The thing that you didn\u2019t like is the number one problem people have with 1997, and although it didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying it, it was far from my favorite thing I\u2019ve ever seen in a Kdrama. If you\u2019re looking for something else with Seo In Guk (Joon Jae) I like his performance in Doom at Your Service a lot!",

In fact, some people, me included, felt like they made the ending too happy for what they had set up. But I know that romances are supposed to have happy endings so I can\u2019t really complain.!&lt;\n\nMy very favorite thing about Doom is their concept of God, and how God relates to the people on earth. It\u2019s a really fresh perspective on the role of belief and the idea that humans can influence how God behaves so that they won\u2019t be without divine guidance. Also, it\u2019s a smaller detail but the costume and makeup department killed it in this. Watch how SIG\u2019s makeup changes the more he connects to people, and how his hair changes colors depending on his circumstances. It\u2019s subtle but great storytelling.",

See our [Spoiler Tag Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) for a guide on how to use spoiler tags, common mistakes, and situations in which spoiler tags are appropriate. Additionally, our sister sub r/kdramarecommends [spoiler tag style guide](/r/kdramarecommends/wiki/spoilertag_style_guide_kdr/) covers how to use spoiler tags effectively.",

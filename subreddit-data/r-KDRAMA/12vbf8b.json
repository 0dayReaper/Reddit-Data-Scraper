    "postText": "\\&gt;!Moon Dong-eun from The Glory  inspires sympathy as well as admiration. So, of course, such a  character deserves an ending that brings closure to her and her  audience.\n\nBut earlier this month, when I was on the last few episodes of this drama, a thought began to niggle at me.\n\nAfter the terrible ordeal of her youth, our protagonist has been the calm center of the storm she brewed over decades.\n\nOver  16 episodes, we watched her slowly topple the bullies who had  terrorized her with a zen-like composure that gave a lie to all the  chaos around her.\n\nBut what did this mean for Dong-eun\u2019s character arc by the end of the show?\n\nWho was she once her revenge was over?\n\n**To find some answers, let\u2019s take a look at the ending of The Glory with a special focus on one particular scene that may be hiding the answer.**\n\n\\[or watch the [video essay](https://youtu.be/KcPtNUbIlbM) here.\\]\n\nAt the start of the story, the drama puts us at the lowest point of Moon Dong-eun\u2019s life.\n\nShe\u2019s  suffered extreme abuse from her classmates, and then her trust is  breached repeatedly by the adults around her. Her dreams of growing up  to be an architect or of just having friends have all been snuffed out  of her.\n\nAt this point, she has two core beliefs: there\u2019s no one to help her &amp; the only reason for her to stay alive is to carry out her revenge.\n\nSo,  she spends two decades avoiding forming any deep bonds and slowly plots  her revenge with painstaking meticulousness. She finds out their  weaknesses, their habits, their relationships, and then focuses on  bringing her life to a place where she can take them on from close  proximity.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that while Dong-eun may have been  the puppet master making the evil friends\u2019 group crumble from within,  but writer never has her directly be responsible for any deaths.  Dong-eun\u2019s goal - except for one case - was to bring each abuser to  \u201cjudgement\u201d, which didn\u2019t necessarily mean death.\n\nThe one exception where she intentionally plotted the death of a person was in the case of Imo-nim\u2019s  husband who was still abusing her. The show makes a clear case for why  this was necessary. The man had kept Imo-nim trapped by threatening her  family members for years. Once she was able to send her daughter outside  the country, her main goal was now to save herself. She couldn\u2019t leave  her husband without risking older family members, so he had to be  killed.\n\nWhether or not the audience finds this  convincing was entirely down to performance, and actress Yeom Hye-ran  made it impossible to argue that Imo-nim should stay in the situation she was stuck in to preserve the life of such a scumbag.\n\nSo, while Dong-eun\u2019s revenge began only for herself, it slowly also became about helping others.\n\n**The  show never questions the morality of WHETHER Dong-eun should seek  revenge, but makes the case that her actions are more meaningful because  they benefit other victims too.**\n\nWhile executing her own revenge, we watch as she helps: Imo-nim  escape domestic abuse; Ha Do-yeon learn the truth about his wife and  protect his daughter from her insane biological father; Kim Gyeong-ran  avoid the consequences of killing her sexual abuser; save the life of  her land lady, help Yoon So-hee by avenging her death.\n\nAnd of course, without Dong-eun even trying, she helped Joo Yeo-jung find new purpose in life once he met her.\n\nWhen  you look at the main revenge plot, Dong-eun doesn\u2019t directly do much to  the villains. She and Yeo-jung work in the background, revealing  secrets, pitting the them against each other, and carrying out a plan  that depends on the selfishness of their targets.\n\nIf  the evil friends were people who had a strong bond of trust, none of  her plans would have succeeded. But instead it\u2019s Dong-eun who keeps  meeting people who want to help her, who want to be her support, and who  are willing to take things to any extreme she chooses. They are  completely in her camp.\n\n**So, The Glory doesn\u2019t just tell a tale of revenge served cold.** It  tells the story of an abuse survivor who tries to keep herself from  being attached to others, but because of a core strain decency and  humanity, she manages to touch the lives of a lot of people, who are  drawn to her, and who trust her absolutely.\n\nIn  juxtaposition to the evil friends, it\u2019s interesting to note that  Dong-eun is never betrayed by any of the people she puts her trust in.\n\nNow, we come to the ending of the story. The ending of Dong-eun\u2019s arc!\n\n**Here we actually get TWO endings.**\n\n\\-----------------\n\n**ENDING #1**\n\nOnce her revenge is complete, Dong-eun goes on a date with Yeo-jung, and then she disappears partway through the evening.\n\nWe find her standing on top of the same roof from which her classmate So-hee had been pushed off by Yeon-jin.\n\nDong-eun has long held the belief that her only reason to live was to get her  revenge. And at this point, that reason has come to an end. She sees no  point in going on. Her pain hasn\u2019t gone away. She still wants to end her  life. So she goes to the edge of the roof, planning to jump.\n\n**This point right here could be the end of the story.**\n\n[Her core belief remains unchanged](https://preview.redd.it/58q3q6lvpgva1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f872e04ba198693ce8e19e9c5b40e17d20e412fd)\n\nMoon  Dong-eun went through almost 2 decades of her life dedicated only to  one goal. She met many people who tried to show her that life could have  other meanings, that she could have other paths. But till the very end,  she only believed that the purpose of her life was revenge.\n\nSo,  inevitably once that purpose was achieved, her life had no more  meaning. In terms of the story it would make sense for her to jump.\n\nBut then, we have the second ending of her story. A much less depressing one!\n\n\\---------------\n\n**ENDING #2**\n\nAs  she stands at the edge of the rooftop, Dr Park, Joo Yeo-jung\u2019s mother  appears behind her. She begs Dong-eun to save her son. Her son, Yeo-jung  was being tortured by the psychopath who had murdered his father. The  senselessness of his death, the triviality of the reason the killer  gives FOR having murdered him was slowly killing Yeo-jung from inside.  He wanted vengeance, but he couldn\u2019t get it alone.\n\nHe was trying, but failing. Dr Park at that moment gave Dong-eun a new goal. A new vengeance. A new justice to seek.\n\nSo, she steps back from the edge.\n\nAfter that Dong-eun goes back to Yeo-jung and this time offers to be his partner-in-crime. She also confesses her love for him, the two kiss, and start a new chapter together.\n\nA new revenge. \ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf89\n\n**So, how does this ending change Dong-eun\u2019s character?**\n\nAt  the start of the essay I said that she had two main beliefs. That  revenge was her only purpose in life, and that there was nobody on her  side.\n\nWith this ending, Dong-eun sees that there were always people by her side throughout the long years of her vengeful journey.\n\nShe thinks back on all the people who have supported her in small and big ways.\n\nNot the least of whom was Yeo-jung, who put his entire trust in her without expecting anything in return.\n\nSo finally, her belief shifted. She had people on her side.\n\nAnd  once this belief changed, she also had to accept that she had formed  bonds, even though she had tried her best not to. Which is why even  though Dong-eun had known that Yeo-jung loved her, as long as she  believed the lie of her loneliness, of her isolation, she couldn\u2019t  reciprocate. His love wasn\u2019t real to her, and therefore her own feelings  weren\u2019t real either.\n\nThis also ties into her second belief, that her life\u2019s only purpose, only value is in her revenge.\n\nOnce  Dong-eun accepted that people had helped her, that she had helped  people and was capable of helping MORE people, she had to accept that  she had formed real relationships in her life. And this helped break the second belief.\n\nHer revenge was not her only purpose. Her life could have other meanings. She could live on as someone other than the 19 year old Dong-eun.\n\nThis  is when we see her visit the resting place of her classmate, So-hee,  and tell her that time has unfrozen for her. Dong-eun can now move on  from her life as an abused teenager.\n\nSo, what would  have been a flat character arc with no change in her internal belief  system has now turned into a positive character arc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Her core belief has changed by the end](https://preview.redd.it/8z3k1lv4qgva1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f09ee9f9ec805950a3090ce4da0296ff53ca30c7)\n\nBoth  of Dong-eun\u2019s core beliefs have evolved. She has people she cares  about, who care about her, and her life\u2019s purpose has changed.\n\nThis  is a much more satisfying ending! She is finally released from pain,  she has a man who loves her deeply, she has friends, she\u2019s pursuing her  dreams, and plotting another murder!\n\nExcellent work. \ud83d\udc4f\n\nBut there\u2019s something spoiling this ending. Just one scene that upends all the growth we just talked about.\n\nSee, there is a problem with how we reached this second ending.\n\nSeveral  episodes before she prepares to jump, Dong-eun already knew that Yeo-jung was trying to carry out his own revenge, and also that he was  failing at it.\n\nShe had also realised by that point that people around her have been helping and supporting her as much as they could.\n\nEven  god was on her side. She may have said that to needle Sa-ra, but given  the sheer number of coincidences that helped her along her journey, we  can definitively say that if a god exists in The Glory, Hana-nim is on her side.\n\nSo by the time she was standing on that rooftop, her beliefs had ALREADY changed.\n\nShe had no business abandoning Yeo-jung in the middle of a date to go jump off a roof at this point.\n\nThat  scene could have just been her saying goodbye to her old self. She  could have stood at that ledge, considered the pact that she made with  herself to end her life after her revenge, and then she could have  thought of all that she had in her life and decided that she now had  reasons to live on.\n\n38 year-old Dong-eun could have comforted 19 year-old Dong-eun and made peace with her trauma.\n\nIn its place, we get this scene, where Yeo-jung\u2019s mom inexplicably knows where to find Dong-eun and arrives in time to give her a new revenge mission.\n\nSo, instead of facing herself and choosing to live, the scene now suggests  that Dong-eun postponed her suicide until this next revenge is done.\n\nAnd I guess in the meanwhile, she decided she could try out normal life cause she has time to kill?\n\nWhat happens when she runs out of revenges? Does she become an avenger for hire, Taxi Driver style?\n\nIt was so close. \ud83d\ude48\n\nThis one exchange ruins the final leg of her character development.\n\nAnd Writer Kim Eun-sook actually [mentions it in an interview](https://youtu.be/ACxta4XqWgE?t=1430)!\n\n&gt;*\u201cI  knew it didn\u2019t make sense for Yeo-jung\u2019s mother to show up on the  rooftop. It\u2019s a fantasy, you know? But if we assume there were tiny  heavenly interventions throughout the story, then it becomes possible  for her to appear there. Because she wanted to save Dong-eun.\u201d* \\- Kim Eun-sook\n\nShe\u2019s  addressing the lack of logic in Yeo-jung\u2019s mother appearing on that  rooftop. And her defense is that it\u2019s not supposed to make sense.  Basically the scene was meant to prove that god was on Dong-eun\u2019s side.\n\nOnly Kim Eun-sook would have the gall to say that a scene doesn\u2019t have to make sense because she was using a deus ex machina. Just hats off. \ud83d\ude06\n\nBut I would argue that the writer had already proved that the heavens were on Dong-eun\u2019s side any number of times.\n\nLike, when she was caught spying by Imo-nim  and gained an ally; or when Yeo-jung decided to dedicate himself to her  cause; or when her landlady quietly fended off her toxic mother; or  even when Ha Do-young just decided NOT to ruin her plans.\n\nHe easily could have, you know?\n\nAnd  let\u2019s not forget every instance when the evil gang just upped and  murdered, stabbed, or exposed each other, conveniently doing away with  any need for Dong-eun to come up with separate, permanent punishments  for all of them.\n\nI mean that really freed her up to focus mostly on Yeon-jin.\n\nSo, that rooftop scene should have been left on the cutting board.\n\n**At the very least, Dong-eun should have saved herself from that jump.**\n\nThat would have been exactly in character for the wonderful, clever, sincere, empathetic woman she wrote Moon Dong-eun to be.!&lt;",

Rooftop Grandma who cares about her silently without expecting Dong-Eun to remember her or give her anything. \n\nYeo-Jung\u2019s mom who physically saves her from death and keeps her present to actually give her life and happiness a go.\n\nImo-nim who never betrays her and always stands by her side and shows her the lengths a mother will go to, to actually save her daughter.\n\nSo yeah it was a bit unrealistic but it was what Dong-Eun needed the most after her revenge was complete. Not a man to save her but a mother. \n\nPlus one of the reasons why both the FL &amp; ML work is because they are partners and him being at the rooftop at that time would have tipped the scale in a way that would take away from them being equal strengths for each other.",

While it is far fetched that his mother was there, we already see false projections based on her inner struggles and I think she saved herself. I think it represents what was really holding her back in the world, saving other people. The scene that hit me the most was the river scene where the child and old lady save each other because they both see the inherent value of each others lives.\n\nDongeun would have immediately gone to him if he were at imminent risk of suicide as his mother makes it seem. She waited 6 months, mostly to reckon with living but to also bring something concrete to him and make sure it was actually possible to help him. None of that tells me she was pulled from that ledge by his mother, because the mother would have made sure her son knew she was fighting for him. She was still considering suicide the whole time and still made a personal choice not to.",

I would like to think that she doesn't take Dr Park's urgent pleas at face value and takes time to think things through before committing to Yeo-jeong and his revenge. \n\nBut it's the way the show lays out those scenes. The emphasis is so much on how Dr Park begs her to save her son and then barely any time is given to Dong-eun's stay at the temple. Instead it's shown as a step to get Yeo-jeong what he needs to push his revenge forward. \n\nWhich means instead of the temple being a place she goes to find peace or self reflect, the show's emphasis on Dong-eun's exchange with the old woman tells us that the moment she steps off the ledge her every move was connected to how she could help YJ with his revenge. \n\nHer stay at the temple wasn't for herself but the first steps to the new revenge. \n\nDo you see what I mean by the show laying it out in a bad way? \n\nI agree with your analysis and it honestly sounds like an ending I would love. But I don't see that story being told between those scenes in that drama. \n\nAnd for a layperson like me with no experience with such cases, I won't be able to fill in the blanks as you can.

For example, Yeonjin's final scene acting as a weathercaster in prison. I personally saw it as her being excited to pretend to be someone important again but it crushing her soul, while others see it as her finally being on the receiving end of being bullied.\n\nAs someone who actively talks people down multiple times a day, I do see value in people reaching the heart of other people. Humans aren't meant to be truly independent from each other. We do need each other to survive. It's personally not important to me that she saved herself if we want to believe that narrative. Her survival doesn't have less impact, because I know that deep down, she still could have just walked off that ledge despite the mother. Her heart *wanted* something to cling to.\n\nMany folks who experience suicide of loved ones wish they could have seen the signs and done something. But the truth is, people need to want to be helped first. If the mother physically wrangled her from the ledge and dragged her to a hospital to admit her - yeah. That would be a sucky ending.\n\nI hope sharing this insight helps you see all of the personal struggles she had to survive to result in this ending.\n\nedit: To help ease your worries about her delaying her suicide until after the 2nd revenge, please look to the river scene with the landlord again where she says that they should delay their suicides to the spring. But neither of them kill themselves in the spring and instead live on to bloom. Convincing suicidal people to wait to kill themselves is actually a really effective strategy because circumstances change.",

A possible counterpoint would be the weight of trauma leaves some pretty deep scars. Throughout her plot we saw her basically break down multiple times for one reason or another. I find it more than plausible that with her revenge finished, her sole reason for living, she was ready to end it all. I think it fits with (some) suicides too, where they do want someone to stop them but if no one is there to, they will end it. It's not entirely far-fetched to throw out the possibility she wanted him to be the one to stop her and in effect it was, at least by extension through his mother. \n\nThe question of \"do you really want to die?\" Was the driving point to bring home all the people she had learned to rely on and that she was worth being loved/able to love someone. \n\nDone in the best way? No, maybe not. But definitely believable that she couldn't be the one to save herself, given the weight of her trauma.",

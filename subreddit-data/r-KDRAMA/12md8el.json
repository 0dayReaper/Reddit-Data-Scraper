I'm going to let the marinate in my mind a bit but it was definitely one of the more memorable shows I've watched, and much, much better than a lot of recent dramas. Loved both the couples and the side characters. Even though there were some parts that annoyed me, I loved how it was resolved and at least this show gave me a satisfying ending (something a lot of shows lack!). Gong Yoo was so charming and gorgeous in this, I don't think I'm ready to move on \ud83e\udd72",

Also, Gong Yoo! So sweet like honey, hahahaha. Seeing all the casts looking younger can be quite jarring at first, but it did grow on me later on.\n\nDo try to watch their reunion special aired last 2020 too. I forgot the title, but basically, it's the main casts reuniting and reminiscing about the show.",

The main characters are a riot but I ADORED the side characters so much! My favourite part of the show gotta be the spinoff series: bamboo forest / the secret though - &gt;!where the King gets jealous of the Queen is surrounded by men all day, and the random competition between Byung In (no thanks to me falling in love with Na In Woo \u2620\ufe0f) and the prince!&lt; \n\nThe 2 episodes are short and sweet but brings me such joy watching everyone just living their best life in the palace without the stress of the main plot. \n\nAnother series is **Be Melodramatic**. It\u2019s so!! quirky and offbeat yet some scenes pierces through your heart. I highly recommend it for those in the \u201calmost 30\u201d age bracket. The pacing is quite unconventional and it felt very fresh. Bonus: The shampoo song\n\nAre there any similar shows on viu or Netflix?",

As Yun Ji-soo in the present day, Lee Bo-young is the personification of grace and elegance. As her younger self, Jeon So-nee looks the part of a 90s-era college student. Yoo Ji-tae is excellent as the male lead as well.\n\nI think I have a weakness for melodramas with a classical, old-fashioned feel, like this one.",

Seo Yea Ji is incredible in this role (had seen and liked her in Lawless Lawyer but she has such range and depth here). Love Kim Soo Hyun as the sensitive ML. Oh Jung Se \u2014 who plays an incredibly different and annoying character in the other drama I\u2019m watching, **When the Camellia Blooms** \u2014 is excellent as the ML\u2019s autistic brother. This drama is weird and fantastical yet moving and refreshing at the same time. And SYJ can really pull off any outfit, no matter how ridiculous.",

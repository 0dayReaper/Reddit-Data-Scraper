I love that one even though it\u2019s not as good as the first part, and now I\u2019m loving TGBM. I told my brother everything that happened in the first two episodes of this drama and he has now started to tune me out. Lol. I told him to watch it along with **The Glory**, which is another one of my favorites. Although he has agreed, I don't know when he\u2019ll get around to it. I can\u2019t wait for the next week now.",

A beautiful love story intermingled with a revenge story with tons of character growth.  We are scared for our OTP, we feel sorry for the 2ML, and we can understand the villain's motivation, even while hating him.  The ending is as satisfying as it gets.  \n\nAnd no noble idiocy, my most hated trope!  There could have been more skinship, but it was from 2013 so that's to be expected.  Lots of little slice-of-life scenes, so it made up for it.",

It might be \"cute\" and refreshing to see once in a while, but I've seen when the sub was full of variations of those posts every single day, especially when they involved a popular drama that just finished airing that you didn't care much about. It became annoying and buried a whole heap of other possibly better posts that you did want to see. I think that's what the mods are trying to avoid. \n\nI find the current format a lot more structured. A bit sterile at times? Maybe.

I have also started **Rooftop Prince** (1/2 of first episode) to see if I\u2019m going to like it. \n\nI watched the movie **Mood of the Day** this week and enjoyed it. I also watched the Chinese movie **Better Days.** It\u2019s impressive and I would highly recommend it if you appreciated the theme in Weak Hero, although the response to the situation was very different in this movie. \n\nI had watched most of the episodes of **Peak Time** but I happened to see a headline about who won and it reminded me how much I hate seeing spoilers in YouTube titles or thumbnails. I usually don\u2019t even watch the previews at the ends of episodes.",

Hmm I do fast forward through this drama, the political aspects are boring to me. Bona looks so pretty and ML actor is doing a stellar job. But I want some good old fashioned swoon. \n\n**Oasis** (6/16). One of the MLs is clearly deluded although I think he is acting very well.\n\nVery slow with drama watching because I watched some animes in between. I also started watching a Spanish drama on Netflix because it sounded interesting.",

            "comment": "So I finally finished **Taxi Driver 2** and while I enjoyed it, I didn't like it as much as s1 because of the tonal inconsistencies. I feel like s1 was better at balancing the super serious nature of the crimes and revenge while still having moments of humor, whereas the second half of s2 would shift jarringly from dire circumstances to sight gags and it just wouldn't let me settle in for a good cry! I was just getting a tissue! You cut away too soon!\n\nA while ago, I compared one of the villains from TD2 with the main villain from **Vincenzo**, and while they did manage to alleviate the concern I had halfway through the season of TD2, I ended up feeling another comparison more strongly:  the ML in **Flower of Evil.**\n\nSpoilers for FoE, Vincenzo, and TD2. Seriously, don't click this. &gt;!I thought FoE's Baek Hee-sung (Lee Joongi) was a glorious study of a character essentially groomed from childhood to believe himself a murderous psycopath also at times possessed by a demon. Subjected to cruel torture as a child, but once he assumes the identity of the Baek family's oldest son Hee-sung (Kim Jihoon), he's denied any kind of parental love and care in exchange for a name and a nebulous future. It's solely because of the love of his wife, Cha Ji-won (Moon Chae-won) and daughter, Baek Eun-ha (Jung Seo-yeon omg so adorable get this girl some egg tarts stat) that he can begin to heal.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The obvious TD2 parallel is On Ha-joon (Shin Jae-ha), groomed from childhood to be a loyal follower of the Bishop (Park Ho-san), Hajoon is stolen from his loving parents, brainwashed, and made to murder his own father as a twisted rite of passage. After losing a fight for his life to Kim Do-ki (Lee Je-hoon), he asks if he had met the Rainbow Taxi team earlier, would his life have been different? My first thought was, \"Yes. You'd be another beloved anti-hero in the Vincenzo mode and you'd end up living with the FL on a private island you bought.\" My second thought was, \"Oh wait, you'd be the ML from Flower of Evil.\"!&lt;\n\nAnyway, I didn't mind the lighter tone in s2 as much with the plots of the week, but the framing device was so dark and the ending to it so quick, I really wish they'd taken an entire extra episode just to give more oomph to the main villain, the contrasts between the villain's philosophy and the Blue Bird Foundation (could've been such a *Cobra Kai* setup), and made the revenge feel more satisfying. I will watch more TD if they want to make it! (I think they greenlit s3 already?).\n\nI rolled the dice and picked a drama from 2020 to watch next; I've been picking good ones lately, all thanks to the advice of this sub!",

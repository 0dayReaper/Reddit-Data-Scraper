            "comment": "Family dramas are usually weekend dramas but I think [My Little Baby](https://mydramalist.com/16483-my-little-baby) fits the criteria. \n\n**Synopsis:** After his sister dies, a man is tasked with raising his niece alone. Starting new, he moves next door to his first love, who is also raising her son alone after her divorce. \n\n**The Good:** So the ML is a hot shot detective who barely made time for his family. He was also very judgemental towards coworkers who took time off for family or changed jobs to accommodate family life. The acting was so good you just know that he was just so foolish. So when he gets saddled with a baby he's forced to take paternity leave to figure his life out. The ML becoming a family man was hilariously cute. Viewers can see that he was way out of his comfort zone but he was committed. Even when he teamed up with his first love to help each other, he really stepped up with her son. \n\n**The Bad:** the ML's ex-partner. She was very annoying. I wished they'd made her less annoying but kept the personal growth. \n\nThe Interesting: it's only 16 episodes. \n\n**Spotlight on:** My Little Baby as this is a fun family drama with romance, mommy clubs and comedy. It really is a fun watch",

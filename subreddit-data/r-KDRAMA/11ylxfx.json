    "postText": "\nJust finished binge watching The Devil Judge and I have so many thoughts that I need to write them down and talk it out with others who have seen it. I know I am \u201clate to the party\u201d, so many have seen this quite some time ago, hope it\u2019s ok to share now with spoilers tagged.\n\nIn terms of characters, I really liked Kang Yo-han and Seon-a.\n\nAs individual characters they prove to be the most interesting and also layered characters. It might appear very black and white for Seon-a, but once she\u2019s established as a key player, we get glimpses of just how much more there is to her &lt;!than just being a villain who climbed to the top at all costs!&gt;. Their pairing scenes are also filled with emotions, both shown and perceived hidden feelings. Through the show &lt;!I wondered if her feelings for Kang Yo-Han were real or just her attraction for \u201cshiny things\u201d. In the end, she says she really loved him and I do believe it\u2019s a mixture of both: she is attracted to what he represents in terms of being the son of a wealthy man, living in a big house filled with shiny things, but also to him as a person, one I think she recognizes as being broken as well. She suffered his supposed death as one would a loved one, so it gives credit to the theory she was really in love with him, in her own twisted way. I came to believe she killed herself for this reason as well, not just because she had no way out (given the lack of evidence while presenting her responsibility in the killing of K and Soo Hyun she could still have tried to escape and justify herself).!&gt;\n\nAlso both actors did an amazing job, just pure brilliance in my opinion.\n\nI read a review saying that Kim Min-jung \u201caegyo\u201d voice was annoying and sort of ruined the character, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more. It made that character even better, to have such a beautiful gentle looking woman be so much more than her looks (again layered). I will never forget the scene where she has a blue ribbon in her hair, just looking like a beautiful Snow White with her Betty Boop lips and showing her emotions.\n\nJi Sung is absolutely perfect as Kang Yo-Han. He just brought so much more to the table, being able to show vulnerability and also strength. I could not have enough compliments for him, his fight scenes, emotional ones, the way he commanded every scene he showed up in. For me Kim Min-jung and Ji Sung matched each other well on screen, for how powerful they portrayed their characters (even if Ji Sung is slightly superior, for doing it with everyone).\n\nKim Ga On is a character that is both likable and frustrating. He is likable for his sense of justice and will to do better, but frustrating for how indecisive he becomes and how susceptible to outside influence he was. If he was supposed to be the polar opposite of Kang Yo-Han it falls flat, so I thinl maybe the opposite of Yo-Han is actually Soo-Yun, who has an unwavering sense of justice by the rule of law. &lt;!The fact that both of them end up holding the knife that Gaon plans to use, shows the parallels of both characters and also just how much both represent in Gaon\u2019s life&gt;. So I do like him but, at the same time, I got frustrated and annoyed for his indecisiveness. He does bring humanity to Kang Yo-Han and plays a pivotal role in the reconnection between niece and uncle. Those scenes (of a family) served as a balm for an otherwise brutal world and show him as kind and loving, bringing to others the love he had as a child.\n\nAs for other characters that stood out for me\u2026 Overall I liked everyone\u2019s acting. Elijah character was so important, she presented a bridge of understanding between the two male leads and was portrayed beautifully. I really liked her. Also liked K and Judge Oh, Lawyer Ko, Minister Cha Kyung-hee (what an amazing actress).\n\nIt also needs to be said that the chemistry between the two male leads was amazing! They really played off each other well and you could tell how they are constantly circling each other and going back and forth in regards to how they trust and support. &lt;!Funnily it ends up being Kang Yo-Han who placed more faith and trust in Kim Gaon, than the other way around. The jaded character ends up trusting more than the one who is shown as being more honest. But like I said above, Kim Gaon ends up being gullible and Kang Yo-Han was not straightforward enough with his plans to cement his trust, so the fault also lies on his shoulders!&gt;.\n\nThe show is not a BL, that much is clear despite almost every edit you find on tiktok or youtube make it seem like it is. The romance part of the show is between Soo-Hyun and Kim Gaon and we see it early on. However, this romance fell flat for me, which brings me to Soo-Hyun character and how poorly executed I believe it was written.\n\nSoo-Hyun\u2019s character appears to be the polar opposite of Kang Yo-Han with a strong moral compass, which could become a good storyline with her connection to Gaon and even serve as conscience. However, she ends up being (only) a support character for Gaon\u2019s moral issues, without adding much more to the story. &lt;!She is for me, sadly, an unlikable character, in the sense that she gets no character development other than being Kim Gaon\u2019s love interest, who is killed as a plot point for him to have a moral crisis and, later, turn against Kang Yo-Han. She presents herself as obsessed in proving Kang Yo-Han as a criminal who killed his brother to try to get him away from Kim Gaon. I get it, but I don\u2019t get it at the same time. I didn\u2019t like how she ends up being shown as someone who used Elijah, so if she was supposed to be shown as a future female influence, that isn\u2019t what we really see. Even the romance, I am sorry to say that Jinyoung (Kim Gaon actor) had a lot more chemistry with Ji Sung (Kang Yo-Han) than with the actress that played Soo-Hyun, which didn\u2019t help any and made the whole romance storyline fail. Some will say: oh you just wanted the two male leads to be together, but no, it isn\u2019t so. Something didn\u2019t work with these two and their cross from friends to lovers was too quick and, again, served the mere purpose of making her death even more meaningful. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t even needed. As Kim Gaon\u2019s oldest best friend, her death would have always be devastating, even without the romance. Maybe even having him not love her back, would make him feel even more guilty, for failing to love someone who loved and died for him, who knows.!&gt;\n\nI don\u2019t think the show queerbaits though. They don\u2019t present it as bromance or romance. In fact, &lt;!Kim Gaon is supposed to look like Kang Yo-Han brother, so it makes us wonder if Yo-Han wanted to trust him because he respected his brother so much. However, from the way the show was acted and directed, I also didn\u2019t get the feeling of a brotherly relationship.!&gt; Since their chemistry is so good and the tension is very much present in a lot of the scenes (with lots of touches being focused with close ups, longing stares and that ending\u2026), I could fully understand why people will edit or highlight the BL undertones of the show. Did they intend to make it BL or just ambiguous? I read an interview with the scriptwriter where he said that he made Kim Gaon character male in a role that is usually female and, in turn, Soo-Hyun would usually be a male cop. Maybe it\u2019s due to this gender fluidity/switch in the writing that we also get a different energy from the two male leads (Kim Gaon is the female energy to Kang Yo-Hans male lead character).\n\nIn terms of plot, I really liked it. It\u2019s a revenge plot, which sometimes could have been better done and you wonder why this or that character died and in such a way, or why they didn\u2019t die, but still loved it.\n\nI don\u2019t think I will rewatch the whole show anytime soon, since there are parts of it that do frustrate me lol Also, don\u2019t think this show needs a season 2. It\u2019s done and dusted, ending like it did is actually perfect &lt;!I wouldn\u2019t mind if sometime in the future they could have become a happy family and the open ending allows our imagination to wonder, but one month after the fact wouldn\u2019t be the time for a hug and make up. Still too fresh and Gaon was supposed to be in love with Soo-Hyun. Curiously, he was willing to die with Kang Yo-Han, while I didn\u2019t get the same feeling when she died!&gt;\n\nI do want to see both male actors in other shows, but as always I fear comparisons with these characters that I really liked and are still very much lingering in my mind (especially, Ji Sung who acts so well as Kang Yo-Han).\n\nShare your thoughts. I am not a very good writer of reviews, but I just felt so many things after finishing the show and had so many thoughts I needed to share a few of them.\n\nEdit: also!! I got the feeling they made Yohan's character insinuate to be bisexual which for a korean show would be huge!!! He says \"I don't discriminate, I treat men and women the same\" also \"you should know my tastes\". These sentences, especially the first one, are said to Seon-a and at first he is gently caressing her when he says it. I found that quite interesting. You can claim he was just saying it in the sense he will hit a woman just as much as a man, but given the full context it doesn't appear (just) that.\n\nEdit : I think the spoilers aren't well tagged. Hope it's OK, since I did tag in the title. \ud83d\ude4f Sorry.",

I found myself \u201cvoting\u201d with them, and while I did not agree with all of the outcomes, I do see how much power Yo-han held as a judge. Whatever the relationship between Yo-han/Ga-on is called, I really liked their dynamic, and Jisung amazed me with his acting (his micro expressions are truly impressive!!)",

In the titles of the episodes, there are references to mythology, Aesop's Fables. Shakespeare, the Bible, and more. The courtroom itself was designed to resemble an amphitheater and the judges wear priestly robes.  Chaos followed the outbreak of a deadly virus and the government is headed by a former entertainer. The powerful betrayal scene is similar to that in the Garden of Gethsemane.  Great cinematography and OST. I could go on and on.",

BL genre is different from this drama, and yet this drama has many images suggesting passion between men, such as the constant juxtaposition of the two men with raging flames. I think that the FL is made to be boring and unsexy on purpose, as a way of showing what it\u2019s like to be a gay man in Korea\u2014having to choose between a sweet woman who you love but don\u2019t desire\u2014but is the only way you can belong in a family or in society\u2014on the one hand, and on the other hand a morally ambiguous man who breaks all society\u2019s rules, and whose love would cut you off from society\u2019s approval, but you desire him in an uncontrollable and passionate way.",

And full of pure emotions, they were toxic to each other, there were times when their personalities clashed too much and the fact that sometimes you can't just solve problems and save a relationship like theirs, was very realistic and kind of a life lesson to me. \nIn conclusion, i loved the devil judge and the soundtrack ROCKS ! It suits yohan so well, maybe i'm a little too obssessed with his character...",

There was just too many misunderstandings brought on by others and Gaon's inability to fully commit to Yohan's cause.

From Episode 1, I already felt attached to the show because it felt so unique. You know when you read a YA book and it has that dystopian, other worldly feeling, for some reason this show seems to capture that feeling so well. the courtroom, the law offices, iIt was so beautifully constructed Everything about the world was so beautiful, kinda mysterious, foreboding and magical.  No one seems to be talking about the aesthetics of the show and I think it should be mentioned because it elevates the show to something that is truly perfect.",

It was kind of like the opposite of the training sequence trope.  Thankfully we got to speed through it...but we felt intimately the frustration the characters must have endured.  Likewise we witnessed the glee of the villains...which also gave us a clue regarding the loyalty of one of the characters we may have doubted (can you guess which?).\n\nI know people generally like things to move forward, but sometimes, like with music, it is the spaces, the quiet times, which may be just as important!",

This is a better, longer-lasting development than demonstrable things like declarations or touching or anything.\n\nThey are also both in situations where they *can't* actually have a romantic relationship, or even declare feelings to each other or anyone else. They're both in precarious positions. She's a fugitive, hiding as a man in the palace, serving him; he's being targeted by these weirdo fanatics who want to bring his family down; and she's engaged to a man she doesn't love, but who cares about her and is the prince's best friend and a supporter he needs. It's all forbidden, impossible love, so although he's feeling and recognising it, he has to keep denying it and ignoring it, and she's not even properly admitting it to herself/realising it.\n\nAlso, he's in a suite where the doors and walls are made largely of *paper*, and there are always servants outside. Not really the place for declaring love to a person who's supposed to be a eunuch or a murderer... \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "In the beginning of the series I thought Sergeant's dad was the &gt;!big baddie and was orchestrating this whole elaborate long-term plan that would make the CP his little plaything and kick out his main political competition by finding a way to push the blame on the Yo family. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!But I'm confused by him and where he stands and what's going on and who is the mastermind ;) !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis continues to be a show where the least interesting element to me is the interdynamics between the leads. I've much more enjoyed the plotline about the CP navigating safely through the court and boiling because he's so frustrated with his political impotence. I've really enjoyed how the drama has paced and displayed court politics and drama. It's done such a good job with sizzling inner-tensions within clans and families. The King and the CP - and each of the ministers and their children - I've found that side of the drama to be very interesting. How stressed the relationship is between parent and child in this political world. That the parents need their children and rely on them to ensure their political relevance, but also need to be wary of them and willing to drop them if their kids risk destabilizing them. Little scenes with the King - where he feels stuck with the CP and forced to isolate him - yet proud of him when he comes back. Or the Sergeant with his dad. Moments when his dad looks proudly at him for the political legitimacy and strength he's already managed to add to the family line at such a young age.  \n\n\nI really \"felt\" each of the character's coups this past episode! And more so- you \"felt\" the coming a new, still premature but very promising, reign. The tightening of CP's future inner \"court\". I loved it!",

                    "comment": "&gt;!I'm also confused by the Left State Minister's role in the plot. Sometimes I think he's genuinely the red herring we've seen so far, and just a supportive/proud dad who's mostly on the right side. But other times, things just don't add up and I wonder if he is somehow manipulating the Song family/Byeokcheon people in order to undermine the Jo family. The scene where he's watching the Song rebel guy's execution is when I started wondering if this is the case. And I'm still not convinced that his motives in buying all those fireworks were totally legit. Lastly, I'm wondering if perhaps he and Jae Yi's father were involved in some intrigue or another prior to the Min family getting wiped out. Marriage talks would be the perfect cover for this kind of plotting.!&lt;\n\nAnd spot on about the \"political\" storylines. Sometimes these can be kind of wooden or filler-ish in a drama but not here. I really like the in-depth characterization that we see even with relatively minor characters and their family interactions, as you point out.",

Huge risk, dude.\n\nHe seemed too genuinely proud of his son stepping up and figuring out how to remain relevant in what will be the CP's future gang of trusted confidants to have ever been plotting the downfall of CP. He also seemed truly pleased that the CP succeeded this past ep.\n\nThough - yes - we also know he fo suuureeee had that stuff in his house for a different reason. Even his son called him out about how the explosives for his wedding didn't match up with what his dad had said earlier!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOOO INTRIGUE WITH MIN MARRIAGE TALKS DIVERSION!!!\n\nTHOUGH I AGREEE!!! Another reason I started to get confused about assuming he's the big baddie is because Jae Yi's dad was so honorable and upright - there's no way he would have been making an alliance with a family he didn't trust// also seems unlikely given his characterization that he would have been easily fooled! But ooOOOoO yes what's the deeper backstory heerreeeeeee. Was her family all that they seemed in the end?",

Or maybe just test the CP (and his son, for that matter) to see if it was really worth the effort to advance their interests?\n\nHe also seems to have total contempt for the King. Like he'll stand up for the King's dignity in court when he can make the Jo family look bad, but otherwise he bad-mouths him in private. I'm wondering if there's some history here that will come out later on.\n\nAnd there has to be something going on with Jae Yi's dad...maybe it's not as much as I'm suspecting, but something doesn't add up there, either. The clues surrounding his death point pretty clearly toward the Byeokcheon crew, so maybe he played some role in the coverup? Or there was some bigger political conspiracy going on that intersected with the rebellion/retaliation and involved more than just the Jo faction?\n\nAnd I almost forgot about my favorite suspicious moment with LSM...the look of pure contentment on his face after his son slices the shaman's snake. Everyone else is utterly freaked out by the situation and/or the mention of the Song family, except him. And he's cooler than a cucumber, all but saying \"Right on, son, now THAT's how you seize an opportunity!\" Definitely not the look of a guy who *isn't* up to something questionable.",

Despite the posters being all pastels and flowery I would say this is so far a darker drama and more historical mystery.  When they said curse prince they really mean to emphasize that.  The FL is on the run and in hiding as a eunach in the palace which always has eyes and ears so we haven\u2019t seen her dressed as a girl except in the beginning.  There are a lot of unknown bad guys who need to be revealed and taken down but it\u2019s the journey and not the end for this show.  They are slowly revealing things so the pacing can seem a bit slow to some.  \n\nDo not start it expecting a heavy and hot romance.  So far only a barely hint since the characters are usually not really in a situation suited for romance to blossom.  Maybe once they solve the mysteries and get rid of their enemies or if they ever get booted from the palace and away from all those spies.  \n\nOverall I am enjoying it for the who dun it and how big is this conspiracy thing set in Joseon time.  They do attempt to lighten the mood at times with side characters who have their own issues.  \n\nI think if you haven\u2019t started it\u2019s good to binge but stay behind the live watch since some things early will make much more sense later but waiting for new episodes can be annoying.",

At first I thought he'd be the cold, abrasive type because of how he was described by his ex as someone who seldomly expressed his love.\n\nBut his every interaction with Bora has always been very kind. But not in a way that makes it look performative. It doesn't feel as something he does to gain her favor, nor does it feel like the usual, dramatic \"ML comes to the FL's rescue\" (with maybe some exceptions). I kinda get the feeling that this is simply who he is. He's someone with a lot of sympathy for people and who shows them compassion and even if it hadn't been Bora he still would've done the same. Love it!\n\nAlso, Changsub's facial expressions &gt;!when he saw Suhyeok and Bora together cracked me up lmao!&lt;\n\nEdit:\n\nEp 12:\n\nOMG &gt;!THEIR FIRST MEETING!!!!&lt;",

Then again I just really like it when female characters grow a spine and stop accepting bad treatment from trash men so her realization that her ex was always a scrub was really satisfying for me.",

Not giddy or vindictive, but just happy and content while watching- this was such a realistic portrayal of someone making peace with their last relationship and inadvertently stumbling into the 'some' stage with someone who was there to support them. Loved the metaphors to the seasons as well. It actually feels like the viewer weathered the storm with Bora and is finding peace and confidence again.",

            "comment": "After watching ep11 I'm glad the themes have been developed the way they have (as I expected) because I think we get a really refreshing take on love in this show that throws out most of the tropes and stereotypes in other romantic dramas.\n\nFirst of all there's the \"if he wanted to he would\" theme that was hammered home this last ep in the scene with Yuri. Instead of going for the cheap trick of making her a villain/ex who ruins everything, making her a cheater or making it out to be that their breakup was due to her not communicating enough, they had SuHyeok admitting that no matter what she said or did he would never have given her the ring because he didn't want to. We also got an explanation of why she was so bad at verbally communicating her unhappiness with the relationship (using sad ballads and books to tell him how she felt instead of coming out with it openly) because she thought he 'didn't like people who openly say everything they think like Bora does' and he basically said 'no, it's different (with Bora)' which shows that Yuri had a good reason for her reticence but also that SuHyeok was not aware of what kind of person or relationship dynamic he 'really likes' when he was dating Yuri. He had to discover this organically though meeting Bora and surprisingly getting along with her.\n\n(Also glad Yuri cleared up that she never 'two timed' in any sense of the word, we didn't need a villain plotline from her to make their relationship interesting and it would have cheapened the story).\n\nThen there's the \"trying hard isn't love\" line by ironically the dumbest and most villainous character in the show JuHwan revisited, with Bora realizing it was a huge truth bomb she needed to hear all along. The show has gone to great pains to show that one-sided 'trying' to make a relationship work is just an indication the relationship is already over. I think the fact Bora finally realized that this episode was her biggest 'growth moment' so far (and the way she used that knowledge in the cafe scene with JuHwan was amazing imo, that's what true security and closure looks like). I actually said in my posts on the ep1 thread that I think Bora's big growth moment will come when she realizes she never had a really good relationship and what her 'relationship advice' was lacking was actual lived experience, and we see that finally happening this ep with her talking about how this book will be a personal essay rather than a self-help book and noticing that her struggle love with JuHwan was just her failure to admit to herself the relationship was over all along.\n\nSo I think this is basically the ep where both characters get their 'full circle' character growth with SuHyeok realizing he needs someone who he is really ready to go all-in for and when he finds a person he feels that way about he needs to show his love openly, and Bora realizing that all her insane tryhard machinations would be unnecessary with someone who's really in love with her back.\n\nI hope we also see some of the other characters coming full circle with these themes now especially YuJeong and her husband (she did make an attempt this episode, but sadly it got completely ignored) realizing that marriage wasn't the right choice for them because he wasn't into getting married, and hopefully CEO realizing he should have showed his love to his ex-wife in a less shallow way if he wanted to keep the marriage going. He's been good about telling SuHyeok the right things (you have to say I love you, you have to give them confidence in the relationship etc) but obviously he was terrible at it himself, so he kind of mirrors Bora as the male version of 'person who gives great relationship advice but doesn't take it themselves or understand why their own relationships failed.' I'm actually personally hoping Uri is a vehicle for him to have this realization, but I'm not sure where that plotline will go.",

She's not bad at all as an advice columnist/writer but she has a severe lack of perspective when it comes to her own life and I enjoy how the show has handled that aspect of her personality and shown that she's kind of self-aware about it.  \n\n\nSuHyeok would be the antagonist fboy 'lack of commitment guy' in any other drama but they've humanized him a lot here without really excusing his behaviour or downplaying how hurtful it was, which I also love. I really would have hated if they took it to the very obvious place of 'he was the real victim of Yuri' but I had FAITH AND TRUST they wouldn't do that and I'm glad the writer didn't let me down.",

Yoo in na is very beautiful and Yoon Hyunmin is extremely handsome\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\n- We got the fake dating troupe, made me swoon so hard, Suhyeok being cheesy was hilarious to watch. Also I think the story about how they met is real but I dislike when Kdrama writers do this(giving the leads a backstory, most times it\u2019s usually them as kids, I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t get that this time)\n\n- We got to see Yuri and Juwan being pathetic again. On Yuri part, I really don\u2019t like when characters break up with another character and then come back crying and begging &amp; also her badmouthing and blaming bora for their break up. Sigh\nJuwan\u2019s, Exes that don\u2019t want you anymore but can\u2019t stand to watch others be with you annoy me. \nThe scene between him and Suhyeok was hilarious cus men and their ego would never seize to amaze me\ud83d\ude44\nAnyways I\u2019m glad Suhyeok finally gave Yuri the closure she needed, cus it was obvious he always loved her but he jus wasn\u2019t expressive, him also finally telling her about the ring and why he didn\u2019t give it to her. You could see the growth in the manner he spoke and the words he said. \n\n- Bora sneakily looking for the ring was so funny and how he knew what she was doing was also funny\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the way they sorted out their fight though. I really like how these two call each other out on their bullshit(the fight scene). The communication is very clear between them, what Bora lacked in her previous relationship and what Suhyeok also lacked in his previous relationship. \n\n-Yujeong and her Husband, I feel so sorry for her because it\u2019s looking like she finally found comfort in settling and so far we haven\u2019t seen much changes from her husband, I mean it\u2019s kinda obvious he does like her but it seems like his love language is different (this is me giving him benefit of doubts of course)\n\n-Bomi and Jinho are finally cute again in my eyes- the way everything is so pure w them \ud83e\udd79 the way they took over Jinwoo\u2019s man cave though lol\n\n- The last scene though I was so invested, the next thing I knew the episode ended\ud83d\ude2d I can\u2019t wait for tomorrow ep although from the preview it seemed like the kiss didn\u2019t happen. [edited_ cuz I forgot to add that I\u2019m a sucker for consensual kisses, the first kiss was amazing I rewatched it a lot, hoping the second one outdoes it]\n\nSpeaking of the preview \n\n-Screaminggggggg Suhyeok is flirtingggggggggggg!!!!! \n\n-Uri is about to get her heart broken, poor girl (from today\u2019s episode you could tell she\u2019s so innocent and pure) but I\u2019m glad cus she deserves someone better not saying Sangjin isn\u2019t a good person but he\u2019s not a good choice for her.\n\nSide note: I love that the writer isn\u2019t giving us \u2018I\u2019m scared to love again cus I got my heart broken the last time\u2019 troupe. Trying again regardless of getting your heart broken is growth!!",

In that film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character realizes that he had put Summer on a pedestal and misread all the signals she sent him (&gt;!she thought they were having a fling and he thought she was his soulmate!&lt;). Likewise, with the texts that Ju-Hwan was sending her, Bora realized that he wasn't quite the prize she had thought he was...",

I like how this show explores the various outcomes of various relationship 'strategies' and attitudes on the backdrop of relationship self-help books and their advice in a realistic way, which we wouldn't get if it was just the main couple.  \n\n\nThis is actually the thing that I think this show has over Mad for Each Other which I in some ways liked more, but it was shorter with a smaller supporting cast so it felt a lot less sophisticated in its storytelling than this show is.",

Some of the scenes are so damn hilarious, (the wedding photoshoot in Ep 11 with the photographer lmao) and without casting Yoo In Na as Deborah, I don't think any of this would have worked, she really pulls it off with ease. \n\nI thought that the FL would consider getting back together with her ex seeing how messy the breakup was, or how Kdramas tend to go. But seeing her and the ML move on from their past with such maturity is a fresh breath of air. \n\nAlso them flirting with each other already and Ep 12 looking like a smooth ride, I'm afraid of what do they have in hold for the next 4 episodes. I'm guessing something will go wrong, we'll probably find out by Ep 13-14 or is it gonna be fun and sweet all along till the end?",

And there are so many things to love, especially how lovely and respectful the main leads are, how realistic and relatable everyone and their actions are. The writer deeply understands her characters and/or has lived them herself.\n\nOne of my favorite romance tropes is when the ML goes along with all the antics of the FL because he finds her adorable and wants to be around her and/or ML keeps finding subtle ways to spend time with FL (without even realizing he is doing it). And this show has that in plenty. \n\nHe is not a pushover and will stand his ground when needed but for most harmless things \u2014 he likes her so much that he finds everything she does \u2018cute\u2019.\n\nI think all the \u2018acting\u2019 words spoken by the ML are all the truth, including when he first saw her.\n\nWe are yet to see what ML is thinking but that is on purpose. The ML is a guarded person whose primary way of showing love is being there, not through words. Of course, he said he will try to verbalise today. So hopefully, we see that with the main leads.",

He's never struggling to want to spend time with her, and he doesn't mind her word vomit because 'with her it's different' (despite what Yuri said about how he always hated people speaking their minds openly, which is probably why she had such a hard time doing so to him), and even 'being used' as a fake boyfriend is something he's clearly knowingly doing for fun and not because he had to to fulfil some contract as in other shows. This is a really sweet dynamic and one I wish we got more in other romance shows.",

But now she is just waiting, trying not to jump ahead, just letting things happen. \n\nThis seems to be an unpopular opinion on here, but I really love the sister and bf! He\u2019s so sweet and needs to figure out how to be realistic, but she\u2019s had too much real world experience and needs someone sweet. Yeah, he\u2019s super cringey, but it\u2019s so innocent.

He understood what she wanted to hear, what she needed to hear, and what would make it better for her to hear. He didn\u2019t fall into the emotional trap that such situations set for us, and he also performed his duty towards her, providing her with the closure she desperately needed.  \nI think that their Mulder and Scully relationship allows them both to \u2018play pretend\u2019 in a sense. It\u2019s like an outfit that they\u2019re trying on, feeling comfortable, being honest, being flirtatious, but they can always go back to we\u2019re just friends or colleagues. Sort of a risk-free relationship that allows them to experiment with the newly learnt lessons that they learned from previous relationships. I find it very realistic and easy to empathize with.",

I think with Uri he gets to see that his 'considerate' actions actually led her on, confused her and in the end made her feel pathetic and small so maybe he will understand what the problem with how he's treated people is.",

The funny thing is, even their cheesy scenes (the cheek pinch for example) don't make me cringe- and I get second hand embarassing really easily. Yoon Hyun Min and Yoo In Na really do have the insane sort of chemistry that we rarely get to see (Just like Mulder and Scully on X files \ud83d\udc40 \ud83d\udc40). Usually for me kdrama couples get old after watching 10 or so eps but these two just keep me wanting for more. One of my favourite scenes was them talking about their parents and how their relationships shaped them both as people and affected the way they look towards love and romance. These little insightful moments in kdramas are so amazing. \nTheir meet cute was just perfect! And that dress\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d No wonder she made such an impression on Suhyeok. Yoo In Na is one beautiful lady! She just oozes charisma.\nThe ML too, in this drama, is ofc extremely good looking but also has such an attractive personality that has more depth than being a simple \"green flag\" that most kdramas fall into the trap of doing when it comes to Male leads. He has realistic flaws- having trouble with communicating- but he tries to improve and yet he doesn't act like a completely perfect person, which makes him appealing. This show has such good writing when it comes to character development. I am definitely going to watch Mad For Each Other (has the same writer) after this one ends.\nThe other couples continue to be boring to me, except the divorced couple- still holding out hope that they will get back together in the end- having become better people who could last this time, but maybe I'm being to idealistic. The Uri situation was resolved satisfactorily imo. He let her down easily but firmly. Yujeong needs to dump that scrub of a husband asap- no wonder the guy is besties with the crappy ex.\nNext episode preview was pretty ominous, I really hope it will be a misdirect. Still holding out hope for Chekhov's ring to find its rightful owner (obvs Bora).\nP.S. The scene where he said \"I might like Bora more than Deborah\" reminded me of one of my absolute favourite movies- Tangled, and the scene where Rapunzel says she likes Eugene more than Flynn.",

They\u2019re playful, yet sincere and serious and so sweetly head over heels over each other in this sort of age appropriate way (I don\u2019t know how else to describe it because they\u2019re essentially giddy about each like young love typically is but because of their past they\u2019re cautiously giddy?). The boundary pushing is oh so gentle but hugely alluring because of the excellent chemistry between YIN and YHM. Their banter although no longer cutting and fairly sweet is so believable of a enemies to friends to lovers progression. Ahhhhh. \n\nSide note: YHM and Nam Joo Hyuk can and should play brothers in a show together\u2026I swear during the entire wedding sequence in Ep 12 with the way they styled him he totally looked like a slightly older and equally hot brother of NJH\u2019s. \n\nBut all this to say\u2026there\u2019s only 2 more episodes and we totally deserve more Bora Su-Hyeok as an actual couple screen time! They are so silly and funny together I\u2019d love to watch a few episodes entirely made up of them navigating being together \ud83d\ude02\n\nBest friend really really realllllly needs to liberate herself from her good for nothing husband. There is nothing redeeming about him. \n\nAnd really not a fan of Sang Jin and ~~Yuri~~ Uri\u2026it\u2019s just so weird, not necessarily because of the age gap since they\u2019re both adults but because they\u2019ve portrayed Uri\u2019s character to be so child like that him thinking being oblivious to her obvious advances is the smart strategy\u2026but let\u2019s see where they\u2019re going with this. \n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t believe next week we\u2019ll be done with the show already \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Their past relationships aren\u2019t just some \u201cfake love\u201d they did actually loved their partners. But you can just clearly see how they fit much better with this new one. \n\nThe communication styles compliment each other. For Yuri, she was scared to communicate, but Bora is straightforward and tells him exactly what she wants and what he should have said. And Bora gets to be her true self and gets a man that actually cares for her well-being. They don\u2019t bullshit and hide from each other. They actually communicate. Very conversations they had are so healthy. They really understand each other and just get it. \n\nAnd the writer doesn\u2019t shy away from letting them flirt for a long time either. It is so healthy they are truly taking that time to truly get to know each other before advancing.\n\nHonestly, ENA really been putting out really great matured scripts!

I mean Yujeong's face says it all haha she's us for real \ud83e\udd23\n\nNeed more of these moments!! Plus &gt;!Suhyeok's endearing smile towards Bora in the pictures they took?!&lt; How freaking adorable. \n\nWas it just me or did it feel like our ML and FL didn't get enough screen time? Maybe the episode just felt really short, idk... Would have preferred to see more of them than whatever the heck is going on with the CEO \ud83d\ude12\n\nWhatever dynamic is happening between the CEO and Uri, its just flat out weird. First, he's wearing the sweatshirt (shouldn't have done that in the first place imo) now &gt;!he was trying to replace it after it shrunk? What is going on? (Also side comment: why on earth did he mix that red sweater with white laundry \ud83d\udc80)!&lt; Maybe it IS guilt that he's feeling towards her? He seems quite aware of her feelings but not reciprocating yet buys her clothes, accepts the sweater, and &gt;!wants to figure out her meal situation?!&lt; IDK.\n\nI'm confused as to why Bomi and Jinho are still hiding their relationship. I can't even remember anymore but was it Bomi who insisted they keep it a secret or something? Plus the basement now too. \n\nI was quite pleased with how &gt;!Suhyeok had handled Yuri. !&lt;I was afraid that there was a tiny bit of remaining feelings lingering around&gt;! but I'm glad he was able to find closure between the two of them. Happy that he's finally able to say himself that he can move on or plan on trying. !&lt;Can't say the same for Yuri, &gt;!she really tried to put the blame on Bora and make her out to be the bad guy, even saying things to him like you don't like those kind of people right?!&lt;\n\nAnyways, &gt;!ANOTHER KISS -!&lt;LETS GOOOOOO",

            "comment": "What can I even say? Episode 12 will go down for me as one of the best kdrama episodes I have watched. The writing is superb, and the episode had such great nods to details we had been given in previous episodes not only regarding our main characters, but also the side couples - meaning the divorced couple and that of bora's sister because the relationship of her friend still stinks of red flags and stagnation for me. The fact that the writers did this wholesome, beautiful coming together of the details in episode twelve and not on the last ten minutes of the last episode as almost any other kdrama does leaves me with such great expectations for next week. \n\nGoing by couples:\n\nI am still hesitant about U-ri and Sang-jin despite seeing that he might be interested in her. I understand his concerns; she's much younger than him, she's an employee, she was hired outside protocol by him and he's never taken a relationship serious after he divorced. &gt;! I am curious to see what Sangjin will do when U-ri comes under fire from the post it the coworker discovered. I think he will protect her and maybe they'll even start a relationship now that he's closed the chapter with his ex-wife. !&lt; \n\nSang-jin and his ex wife made me cry. &gt;! I truly think they care for each other, and I felt both their heartbreak when he confessed why he went along with the divorce without a fight. By the time they separated, they just were not the right person for each other but the show demonstrates how this does not negate the love they had !&lt;\n\nI loved the vulnerability Bomi showed, and I am happy to see that she seems to truly appreciate her boyfriend. The relationship on screen is maybe a seven for me but that moment in the basement made me see her under a different light. I too shared other people's opinions regarding her personality based off the first half of the show. She seemed spoiled and empty headed. I now think she's a lot like Bora, a tough cookie. \n\nNow, god, my two favorite people ever! Our dear Bora and Soo-hyuk. We see soo-hyuk being vulnerable and open with Bora, in more ways than before. I feel like &gt;! he is openly pursuing Bora now but I hope he makes this clear, with words words, soon. For me it feels like we are at  risk of this push and pull being like in his previous relationship, where he just assumed the girl knew and she ended up feeling insecure and frustrated. I can see Bora thinking about his motivations and wanting to find out what he truly thinks !&lt; As I said in a comment I posted previously, it just makes me feel giddy seeing them navigate their attraction, I feel like I am falling in love with Bora's cuteness and Soohyuk's eyes! I absolutely adore how he looks at her, the way he takes pictures of her right side and is such a gentleman. I do not know why it striked me so much seeing him drink with her, it felt special. There is something I noticed because it was specifically used in my absolutely favorite kdrama, I Need Romance 3. Soohyuk called Bora &gt;! Jagi, I might be mistaken although I do not think so. When he tells her \"you don't see yourself objectively\" he uses Jagi instead of dangshing. In I Need Romance 3 this became A Thing because the male lead was raised in America and kept using this term with the female lead, until she called him out saying it was a term used between lovers. He then made a point of using it every time he was trying to express his feelings for her. I think it was really cute, and I hope I am not mistaken in what I heard lol. He did not use again during that scene, so it makes me feel hopeful he did something so heart fluttering. !&lt;",

But I guess people in their 20s might be more hormone-driven than people in their mid-to-late 30s. But wow, Soo Hyuk was sending such mixed messages by inviting Bora over to this apartment for a drink and then changing his mind after she said yes. SMH. And him dancing around asking Bora to be his girlfriend. It's like how he never asked Yuri to be his girlfriend over the course of six years!\n\nI hope it was just bait in the preview when Soo Hyuk says \"congrats on the radio show and relationship\". Maybe he means relationship with him and not Jun Hwan?",

                    "comment": "He changed his mind because he remembered he's been lying to her about where he lives (told her he lives in her neighbourhood as an excuse to spend more time with her) and that if she found out where he actually lives she would have QUESTIONS FOR HIM. Then in the cab I think he was slightly hoping to finagle his way into her place but she said 'Bomi's waiting for me at home' so he was like oh damn.. nevermind. So this is perhaps the one time on this show SuHyeok was NOT just stupidly sending mixed messages, he just chickened out on showing all his cards so soon.  \n\n\nI don't think he will make the same mistakes with Bora as with Yuri because he already told Yuri he will try to do better in his next relationship and even took the pretty big step of trying to explain to Bora why he's so cagey with expressions of affection, but I think he's a little hesitant because she's batting away all his super obvious hints (like the whole conversation at the barbecue place/bar in the beginning where he's like HELLO I'M HERE, ME THE ONE WHO LIKES YOU and she's just like oh no who could it be), but he's probably trying to take it slow because she's drawn a bit of a line with Mulder/Scully thing and the attempted kiss in the theater and he doesn't want to come on too strong with a woman who seems to be drawing a boundary. He also doesn't know how over JuHwan she is because he was playing out his own psychodrama with his ex while she was casually burying JuHwan with fake kindness.  \n\n\nMy guess is since they have to get through 2 more eps with them probably getting together in the last one, there will be some 'misunderstanding' he has about JuHwan that causes him to act out, because she's definitely completely over him I think.  \n\n\nRe: Bomi progressing faster than Bora it makes sense because she's young, hormonal, no baggage, and isn't trying to protect some weird pseudofriendship so it's easier to progress the relationship.",

(edit: I think we know for sure this is a lie because he has no idea where she lives, but she's too drunk to notice).\n\nThen in peeing bus scene she runs for her bus and he's just walking behind not trying to catch that bus but she turns around and yells 'what are you waiting for? You live near me!' and he says 'Oh, I thought she wouldn't remember/I can't believe she remembers' or something so then he gets on the bus with her too, obviously indicating it's not his bus but he didn't want her to know he lied.\n\nThen finally there's that scene a couple ep ago when he's sad about Yuri where she says 'this time I want to walk you home and comfort you' which he obviously wants but makes some lame excuse like 'I just want to take a walk alone' and starts going in the literal opposite direction of where she's heading, b/c at this point he doesn't want her to know where he lives.\n\nETA: also in the housewarming scene when the delivery gets sent to her old address, he's like 'haha who would have thought only I brought my car' because everyone else lives/works within walking distance of Bora's house except SuHyeok who needed to drive there.",

            "comment": "Ep 12: \n\nI understand why we humans tend to get mostly shaped by bad memories rather than good ones but I also wish why we could stop doing that to ourselves. It\u2019s pretty obvious Suhyeok was raised with love, like you can tell from how well mannered and good natured he is, but the scar his parents marriage left him at a young age still exists; his view on marriage and also why he was that way with Yuri. \n\nI was always curious about Suhyeok\u2019s parents, glad the writer showed us now I hope they bring in Bora\u2019s parents too cuz it\u2019s obvious Bora as well is shaped the way she is because of her family background. Also every time I remember her phone call with her mom in the early episode I need a face to cuss at. jk\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 [Edit: I was rewatching and realized that I missed where Bora talked about her family, this explains a lot, also the drama reference was so sad I wanted to give her a hug so bad]\n\nThe backstory between the leads wasn\u2019t as bad as I assumed it would be. If anything it was nice. \n\nIdk what I love most about Suhyeok and Bora, them being friends or them flirting with each other. They know so much about each other and can tease each other in this really adorable way but they also wanna eat each other so badddddd. THEIR CHEMISTRY IS INSANE. Also We were talking about how Suhyeok\u2019s method acting was too much to handle and Bora said hold my beer (I was in tears and also cringing at how hilarious she was). The photo scene though \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nUri confessing her feelings regardless was good cuz it will help her heal easily but I think the writer is up to something\ud83d\ude12. Sangjin\u2019s ex forgave him after he told Uri he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s deserving of love now his costars find out due to that loud mouthed employee *screams uggggghhhh\n\n\nWhen I saw Juwan in the preview I was actually fuming \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d like this man is still here?!?!?! Hopefully what Bomi told Suhyeok about her unnie still crying doesn\u2019t affect Suhyeok next episode esp with Juwan being back again.\n\n\nThis episode was kinda a letdown (minus the leads flirting scenes) cuz it seems like we\u2019re back to square one with EVERYONE of them. The only people that made progress in this episode were the younger couple: They seem bearable now, He\u2019s a sweetheart rooting for her that way and telling her those words of encouragement when she\u2019s doubtful of herself.\n\n\n- and also Sangjin x Sujin: Seeing both him and his ex wife take responsibilities in the failure of their marriage was nice, again establishing the point I think the writer has been trying to make since, that everyone in each relationship has a role in why things don\u2019t work out. \n\nAlso it was nice to see Suhyeok and Yuri say their last goodbyes. Yuri looked good in her wedding dress. \n\nYujeong\u2019s husband jus keeps getting worse imo, the dinner scene was hilarious cus I\u2019m that unserious irl so there\u2019s no way I could easily play along w Yujeong\u2019s antics but I\u2019m curious is her husband not fully aware there\u2019s an actual problem in their marriage? He seems so clueless about everything[although the scene with Bomi didn\u2019t seem that way]. I say this cus despite being that unserious irl if there\u2019s an actual problem that I\u2019m aware of between myself and my spouse, I\u2019d make a bit of an effort. When he got into the role because he didn\u2019t want her to go downstairs, that was the last straw for me. \n\nWatching the preview I wanted to hug Yujeong, I know she was overreacting again with the cheating assumptions but when u find out about ur man\u2019s secret cave in an ugly way, any and every thoughts goes through your head at that moment. \n\n\nBeing a dating coach it\u2019d have been out of character if Bora didn\u2019t know about her sister and Jinho but it\u2019d have been nice to figure out the exact moment when she realized.",

(holds up two fingers) BOM-YI?\" and both her and Bora chuckle about it and how obvious they're being, remember at the start of ep9 in the car YuJeong asks her husband how he knew she was at that bar and he says 'JinHo told me' which JinHo could only have known if he was texting the sister.

Glad they wrapped up Soo Hyuk and the ex neatly. Yuri got her closure. Dude was a pretty nice guy but what Bora previously said about how he should have answered Yuri's question really stuck with him and it made him finally say the right words. He's such a cringe catfish though. Quite over the top. But I was smiling all throughout! The way he teased her with his cheesy lines at the gym made me so giddy. Lee Soo Hyuk is probably one of my favorite male leads in a romcom. This show made me fall in love with YHM again.\n\nAnother kissss???? I really love the fact that the kisses weren't drunken kisses.

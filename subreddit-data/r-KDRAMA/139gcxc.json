    "postText": "Welcome to our series of posts highlighting information and resources available within our subreddit. In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about Netflix, check out our [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) for even more information.\n\nIf you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.\n\n**What is The Swoon?**\n\n**The Swoon** channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpiCK8c6PBktcxq7Az_t4RQ) is Netflix's official hub for Korean and Asian entertainment so that's were you want to go for official goodies from Netflix for things related to kdramas/kmovies and other Asian entertainment offerings.\n\n(It's also the only acceptable source of previews/teasers for Netflix productions.)\n\nNote: Mod team actually emailed Netflix to confirm that the channel is the official source, so anyone offering teasers from other channels will be seen as re-uploads and not permitted in accordance to our Rules on content.\n\n**What is the difference between \"Netflix Original\" and \"produced by Netflix\u201d?**\n\n**Netflix Original**: Netflix will label any drama they have exclusive streaming rights to in a certain region as an Netflix Original in that region ***even if*** Netflix is only licensing the content and was not part of the production process.\n\n**Produced by Netflix**: these are dramas that Netflix financed and produced (examples include Kingdom, Love Alarm, My Holo Love, Extracurricular).\n\n**Quick tip** to distinguish between a *licensed* Netflix Original and Netflix production: \n\n&gt; All episodes released on the same day ***worldwide*** = Netflix production\n\n&gt; vs.\n\n&gt; Episodes released weekly concurrent with its airing schedule in Korea ***OR*** the drama finished airing in Korea but is still unavailable on Netflix = a *licensed* Netflix Original\n\nFor more info, check out [Netflix\u2019s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976) and the article [The Four Types of Netflix Originals](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/the-four-types-of-netflix-originals/).\n\n**Why isn\u2019t [drama] available even though it\u2019s airing in Korea?**\n\n***We don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not Netflix.***  When (if ever) a drama comes to Netflix for any given region depends on the licensing agreement Netflix has. For more info, check out [Netflix\u2019s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976)\n\n**When is [drama] coming to Netflix for my region?**\n\n***We don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not Netflix.*** Netflix tells you to keep browsing the [New Arrivals](http://www.netflix.com/browse/new-arrivals) page and looking out for its announcements via [Press Releases](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases).\n\n**How Good Are Netflix's Subtitles?**\n\nNot great: they often skip over nuances in the language. \n\nCommon example of subtitle inferiority include use of the ***name*** of a character throughout no matter what that character is being called in the dialogue. This can at times be a spoiler if the dialogue was being purposely vague.\n\nAnother ***very common*** complaint is that due Netflix subtitles often contain more cursing/profanity in comparison to what is actually being said in the Korean dialogue. This has been speculated to be attributed to Netflix's choices for localization of subtitles. So just be aware that cursing in kdramas, especially ones broadcast on any of the free to air channels (KBS, MBC, SBS) are relatively rare and mild.\n\n**Which Dramas Are Dubbed?**\n\nBased on user feedback, it seems that Netflix offers dubbing only on Netflix productions. See the Netflix help article on [How to use subtitles, captions, or alternate audio](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/372) to change your options.\n\n**What's with the music?**\n\nBackground music in kdramas may be altered on streaming platforms in comparison to original broadcast due to copyright and licensing issues. Streaming sites will replace songs with generic choices if they do not have the correct licensing. In general, the songs being switched out are ***not original*** songs created ***solely*** for the drama, instead they are pre-existing songs.\n\n***Longer Answer***\n\n**Note: The explanation below is a very simplified look at a very complex legal issue. Use it for reference, not authority.**\n\nIn terms of licensing, each individual song can be thought of as having two sets of legal rights associated with it: publishing rights and recording rights. Publishing rights refers to the rights of the songwriter (or the publishing company that now hold the rights). Recording rights refer to the rights of that specific recording/performance (usually held by the recording company).\n\n&gt; Example to illustrate the point:\n&gt;&gt; Think of the [Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne) song.\n\n&gt;&gt; The melody is an old Scottish folk song so ***no songwriter can claim publishing rights for it***. People all around the world can use the melody without having to obtain its publishing rights. In fact, it was used as the tune of the [SK national anthem for a few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegukga).\n\n&gt;&gt; Now imagine that some Singer X made a recording of a specific performance of the song Auld Lang Syne. This specific recording would have recording rights associated with it but no publishing rights associated with it. \n\n&gt;&gt; If someone wanted to use this recording made by Singer X in a drama as part of the soundtrack, they would need to license the *rights to use this particular recording* (recording rights). They would not need to obtain publishing rights since no songwriter/publishing company has those rights.\n\n\n**Now for kdramas:**\n\nThe music used in kdramas can be one of three types:\n\n&gt; 1. Previously existing songs,\n\n&gt; 2. A specific recording of a previously existing song made just for the drama (such as a remake), or\n\n&gt; 3. A new song written and recorded specifically for the kdrama.\n\n\nOf these three types, only types 2 and 3 are included in the kdrama\u2019s OST (original soundtrack) because they were originally *created* for the kdrama.\n\nAnd of these three types, only type 3 songs are easily licensed for worldwide distribution because both the publishing and recording rights are recently created and generally bundled together with the drama licensing rights.\n\nFor type 2 songs, while recording rights may be relatively easy to obtain since the recording was made specifically for the drama, publishing rights may be hard to obtain, especially for worldwide distribution.\n\nFor type 1 songs, both publishing and recording rights have to be obtained, making it even harder. Especially if the song is an existing kpop hit song whose international distribution rights are already held by different companies in different regions.\n\n\n**Now why does Netflix often switch out songs:**\n\nBecause the songs switched out are often pre-existing songs that Netflix cannot (or has chosen not to) obtain international licensing rights for. Keep in mind that Netflix is available in ***a lot*** of markets internationally so if they want to license a song, they have to license it for every single market in which this drama will be streamed in. \n\nSo if this drama will be streamed in 20 countries, then Netflix has to obtain song license rights in all 20 countries in order to use it, which can get ***really expensive*** really fast. For songs written and recorded specifically for dramas, licensing is feasible because the song rights are likely bundled with the drama streaming licensing rights, but is near impossible if the song is a pre-existing song with existing distribution deals in different markets. \n\n&gt; A Hypothetical:\n\n&gt;&gt; **Fire** by BTS was used as the intro song by a character in Fight My Way ([\uc308 \ub9c8\uc774\uc6e8\uc774](https://mydramalist.com/22472-fight-for-my-way)).\n\n&gt;&gt; To stream the drama with this song in the USA, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Brazil, Netflix must obtain the licensing rights for this song in ***all five countries***. If Netflix cannot obtain the correct licensing rights for even ***one of these countries***, then the easiest way to deal with the problem is to switch the song out for some generic tune that they do have the rights for.\n\n&gt;&gt; For a big act like BTS that definitely has different distribution deals in different markets, getting the licensing rights is probably a big challenge (and expense) and likely not worth it from a business standpoint for Netflix. The result is background music being replaced with generic tunes. \n\nAnd in case you were wondering, the music problem is not limited to kdrama content, see this [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp) article explaining how music licensing rights are a huge headache for older shows now being released on streaming platforms.\n\n**Known Alterations to Kdramas on Netflix**\n\nWe have a list compiled from feedback by our community about the type(s) of changes that were made to specific kdramas as they were broadcast on Netflix versus original SK broadcast. Subtitle issues are ***not*** included. This list is provided for reference and has not been verified in any manner.

You don't just apply for a permanent position on the other side of the world without consulting your partner. At that point he ended the relationship, doesn't matter if he meant to or not. They ended when he made that decision by himself without informing Heedo. Which honestly seems super out of character for him, to me, but well, I guess he did choose his job over her last episode as well. How hypocritical of him to tell her \"you've been thinking by yourself\". Sucks, because before that he was a super lovable character to me. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I guess it is realistic in the sense that this is a reason for couples to break up in the real world as well, but I just didn't see it as realistic for them specifically. !&lt;But props to both of the main actors.

He also was putting distance between himself and heedo at the time. It was also a reasonable next step in his career and if he were to not do it because of heedo he would be mad at himself and might even resent heedo. It's still a dick move but I can understand it. They both weren't experienced enough in relationships and even though they were great as friends, a relationship brings about so much more expectations and reliance. Him being avoidant and heedo keeping silent on the things that affects her eventually killed the relationship. So it wasn't entirely his fault nor was it heedo's it just happened. And it was a product of the times (because of 9/11)!&lt;",

                            "comment": "Right now, I get the sense all Yi Jin's previous relationships failed because of lack of communication and inability to share the hard times. I mean, even with his previous friends that he characterised as abandoning him when he had no money. But when he was at that job interview, he had at least that one friend who actually came and insisted to give him money (because he cared about him, not mocking him).\n\nYi Jin is too much of an idealist, thinking that life can only be happy and that he has to be happy with others only. He sought out (and continues to seek out) positions where he can do acts of service for others, for example with the squad where he was able to take care of them in various ways, and with the new trainee where he offers advice. He only wants to present one side of himself and be able to bring something to others, but needs to be able to accept being himself around others when he's in the weaker, vulnerable position.\n\nPreviously, what he had with Hee Do was attractive to him, because they promised to only be happy together, which distracted him from his negative self-image. But when he was unable to share anything positive with her and felt unable to support her, then he couldn't quite engage any more.\n\nI think partly it comes from being the chaebol's son when he was young. Other than being rich and generous, he was good-looking, popular, good at studies, and good at extracurriculars too. That's his own self-image, and after growing up like that, he could never quite get used to the changes in his circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, Hee Do grew up being comfortable with sadness and defeat in her life. If she was not to share any of it, then she may as well not share anything with people. Her mindset is fundamentally different, that to suffer together is meaningful and necessary in any long-term relationship to preserve connection.",

Which makes the writing in this series some of the best kdrama's ever in the slice of life/relationships genre aside from the likes of My Mister, Misaeng, Be Melodramatic, and The Light in Your Eyes.\n\nI was always under the impression that this series was offering this up since the beginning, and was really satisfied that it finished it. That said, I do feel bad for many who approached this series as an escapism and were hoping to see them together at the end.\n\nIn fact, this entire thread starting from Junie94's post about how it was Yijin's fault is great. Across a few replies, the reason for the polarizing ending was encapsulated by an observant and insightful few. The bit on Yijin processing his guilt is gold, and the more I think of it, using the IMF situation as the backdrop leading into 9/11 was a big hint of the direction that this kdrama (may) have intended from the beginning - dealing with the guilt that resulted from a major (life) crisis within/outside of one's control.\n\nWe saw how Yijin's dad and family dealt with it, which then spilled over to how he dealt with it himself. We saw how Heedo dealt with her dad passing, and how her mom's coping in the way of their mother-daughter relationship. We saw how Yurim used stoicism to deal with her family's predicament. Orbiting around them are Jiwoong who offered Yurim positivity and Seungwan who offered consistency and conviction.\n\nThese layers in the series writing is what makes it an instant classic in my eyes, despite the uproar of the ending for many of the show's ardent followers. I share a bit of their disappointment, even if I wasn't necessarily rooting for Baekdo myself.",

He literally promised that he wouldn't be happy as long as he lived, because of his father's wrongdoings. How he chose the NY job, sabotaging what he had with Hee Do. He said so himself, missing someone feels like a luxury, like he wouldn't receive anything good coming his way. Even when he found NHD's diary, he could have reached out, asked for a second chance with her and stayed in Korea, but he left anyway. It's like he felt he had to compensate for something, if people are suffering there, i can't be happy here, kind of thing.",

But yeah, he fell in love first, knew he was in love first, confessed his love first, and wanted to stay together. The only thing that stopped him in the beginning from immediately pursuing a romantic love with Heedo was his own fear of hurting or disappointing her. \n\nIf the ending told me anything (the password/security question scene), it\u2019s that he may have moved on, but he\u2019s never gotten over Heedo. And that\u2019s what I found the most beautiful and the most painful, honestly.\n\nHeedo, in her own way, had a part of her that hadn\u2019t gotten over it either. But something about her demeanor and the way she talked about her memories felt like her feelings were so faded over time already.\n\nAnd when you watch the 2009 interview between herself and Yijin, his eyes are full of love while hers are in a way full of regret. \n\nWhat she can\u2019t get over is the way they ended. What he can\u2019t get over was the way they loved.",

Even while cancelling their phone couple plans, he was only following Heedo's lead saying yes and signing the paper. From the beginning, Yijin has always shown so much respect for her and valued her choices, an expression of his love for her. But it still frustrates me that he had the chance to be reckless atleast once for their relationship and didn't take it. That's just me though.",

            "comment": "This wasn't just a sad ending (I can enjoy a good sad ending), it was a horrible ending.\n\nThe biggest frustration I have with it is that since the present timeline was never resolved, it had no reason to exist. There is no character development, no resolution for any character other than NHD, no nothing. If the message of the drama was supposed to be how fleeting our youth can be, the story could've been easily resolved in 2009 with the original cast. They could've just as easily had a scene in 2009 where NHD and BYJ have gone their own ways, they run into each other at some point (maybe at Seung wan's father's funeral), and they share a knowing glance acknowledging their past. That'd be sad, but it'd be a *good* ending. \n\nI don't mind them breaking up because of long distance. I actually liked how they made an effort to amend their breakup so that they didn't end on such a low note. I feel that could've easily been a good ending for the drama. They just didn't need to toy with the viewers with this ridiculous, boring 2020 timeline.\n\nThis was on pace to be one of my favorite dramas ever, across more than 65 of them. As much as I hated the ending, it still doesn't totally ruin the rest of the show for me (and unlike some other people, I thought the developments in episode 14-15 did mostly make sense; it was really just the very end of 16, and knowing the whole present timeline that I never liked to begin with was a waste of time). What I kinda wish I could do is go back in time and skip the present scenes entirely.\n\nedit: \n\nI did some reflection and I think I would at least partially walk back what I wrote. I think the ending caught me by surprise when it really shouldn't have. Most of the \"clues\" suggesting they end up together were ridiculous reaches or very, very minor things (that if I'm being honest, I hadn't noticed until reddit comments pointed them out), when the main message of the drama from the beginning (KMC not recognizing BHJ, repeated messages about the ephemerality of youth, the 2009 interview clearly looking like exes who had seen each other after a long time, etc.) made it pretty clear they wouldn't end up together. So I guess the future timeline wasn't really \"toying\" with the viewers.\n\nI also now think it makes sense that they didn't resolve who KMC's father was. That just wasn't the point of the story, and introducing some random dude in 5-10 mins wouldn't have added anything.\n\nThat said, I think the future timeline could've been a lot better. For one, I never liked the actress playing adult NHD, and I still wish they had just put some makeup on kim tae ri to make her look older. KMC's story never really built to anything (ok, she wants to resume ballet now, whoopty do). I also wish they had shown BHJ with his own happy memories, though I also understand why they didn't I guess, since the story and the narrative was focused on NHD and her diary.\n\nI've liked dramas with sad endings before, I guess (like Red Sleeve), but I was never really wishing/hoping for a happy ending for any of those. I guess it's because I often spoiled the direction of the ending before I watched. I have to give the finale some credit for evoking such strong emotions from me.",

Yes, others will say that it was realistic and all. But come on, how \"realistic\" was their friendship anyway? Boy, it was MAGICAL- it transcended all borders, pulled them out of their own misery. It was MIRACULOUS. So I just feel so damaged knowing that a love that shined so bright crashed and burn they way it did.\nI part of me hoped that they chose to work it out or atleast remained friends even after everything else. Cause that's how they made me feel on ep 1-13. That they may be apart, but they will always be there for each other.\n\nIt also leaves a bitter tang in my mouth that I didn't see Hee Do happy with her husband, nor did I see Yi Jin and Hee Do in good terms in their present life.\n\nIt feels like a \"hi-hello-ouch-bye\" for me. But don't get me wrong, I understand the pain and trauma for both of them. I just have a hard time accepting that someone who literally pined for each other til the last moment found no way out and found no solution to keep their partnership alive.",

            "comment": "After a few hours of sleep and contemplating, I think I understand why they had to break up.\n\nThey lacked communication, first and foremost, but that's because these are the things that they cannot change, whether they stayed in a relationship or not.\n\nHeedo, indeed, cannot be in a relationship with someone who is like Jaekyung, her mother. The constant absence of her mom when she was still a child traumatized her, that it felt like the sense of duty was much more important than their family. Although she has gotten used to it, it does not mean she was willing to go through it again with another loved one. Being with Yijin would mean reliving her past trauma again.\n\nYijin had unsolved baggages at that time and that job was the only way that can fix it. Even before meeting Heedo, reuniting the family was already his top priority.\n\nIt hurts to see that this was their first and last fallout as a couple but they cannot compromise any of these even in the long run because of the permanence of Heedo's trauma and Yijin's ultimate pursuit and his love for family. If they had continued being in a relationship, they may only end up hurting more and part ways with bitterness and left with painful memories. They only want to remember each other with good memories--they mean that to each other so much.\n\nThat's why the bench scene was so painful because they loved each other until the end and still are. They still are thankful for each other and the time they had because they were each other's strength in their lowest and it helped them to become the person they are today. They can look back on this with gratefulness and root for each other even from afar.\n\nHow I wished Yijin tried not to be like Heedo's mom and be constant figure in her life to prove that he will not do the same mistakes her mom did but I think that would cost something from him. He already got so much in his plate.\n\nThe breakup was understandable to me now but I wished the pacing of it in the drama was stretched to a few more episodes because it was really abrupt that it was hard to digest everything in one episode. This could've left more time for a scene after their 2009 interview where they meet each other again in the flesh. They crossed paths again but in a time that they've already achieved their goals and grew thick skin, and reminisce on their decision with some satisfaction.",

WHY? why did heedo, the same person who said that it was okay to do what he did because it was his job, *he was a reporter. she was a fencer.*, said \u201cgo to therapy if you\u2019re feeling that way\u201d?\n\nhis explanation for not telling her about the nyc position is being shamed left and right, but depression can do that to a person. you should be thankful he made out of it alive. yijin has never been a selfish person. all he thinks about is the people around him. *i need to reunite my family. i need to not be an embarrassment to my brother. i should work my way to the top so i\u2019m not an embarrassment to heedo.* he\u2019s selfless and is so freaking bad at sharing his worries but how is that wrong?! sorry to burst your bubble but everyone can\u2019t do that easily! it takes *years* for someone who has been like this forever to open up to the people around him, and he was trying to work on it! \n\nbut even after everything, are you saying that the people who went through the lowest points of their lives together, went from strangers to friends to lovers in a span of three years just\u2026 threw everything down the drain over one conversation?! heedo *courted* him when he tried to push her away, yijin once said *try and ignore me one more time. i won\u2019t sit still.* okay, let\u2019s say they broke up because heedo was having a hard time seeing him turn into her mother, but she forgave her mother after *one interaction*. she forgave yurim after *one confession.* okay, forget that too. heedo has been self-aware for as long as i can remember. she has always been able to make sense of things even when they didn\u2019t make sense. when newspaper boy yijin asked him how much she wants in return for that statue she said that she doesn\u2019t know because she was just venting. if that\u2019s heedo, why didn\u2019t she see this coming? why didn\u2019t she *talk* about it with yijin instead of pondering it over for six months alone? he changed his career for her, does she really think that he won\u2019t put her above his work in cases of emergency? okay, forget that too. how did they not interact once after yijin came back to korea? he was in touch with her mom. why didn\u2019t he see her once?\n\nthis is so messed up. why are we left with so many unanswered questions? and don\u2019t dare give me that first love bs. first loves are supposed to be reckless, based on selfish desires, lust, etc etc. this is not the story of first loves! this is a *one-time thing*. they were *soulmates*! people are not hung up over their first loves by the time they turn 40, they don\u2019t suddenly lose consciousness after being through hell and over just due to their first loves. you should have not made everything so freaking perfect if that was where you were going to end with. show the cracks! show the distrust! don\u2019t show two people willing to trade the world for each other! the prop team toyed with us up until the very end, the weird reactions of present day characters were just to play with our emotions, you *mocked* us with that cameo! no offense, writer-nim, but that\u2019s psychopathic behavior.\n\ni am so *sad*. all those theories, the time, the investment, just for our characters to not act like themselves in the end? you had to bring up 9/11 and do a 180 on their personalities just to bring the \u201crealistic ending\u201d you so dearly loved home, and that *still* didn\u2019t work. and why was the \u201crealistic ending\u201d just reserved for baekdo? you\u2019re saying that a two-second interaction between seungwan and yijin\u2019s brother led to something meaningful in the future but all that foreshadowing, the *you were always with me in the end*, the *i love you in every way*, the *you lead the world to a better place*; every tiny thing was for *nothing*? \n\ni was *raging* when heedo went \u201cwherever you are, i\u2019ll make sure my support reaches you\u201d in that interview because where tf were u when he needed your support the most????? why did yijin get the short end of the stick every freaking time???? wtf was that \u201cwho is your first love\u201d thing???? do u like messing with us????? all those precious, tender moments ending with \u201cthat summer was ours to keep\u201d???????? oh my god are you freaking serious????????????\n\ni don\u2019t ever rewatch shows or dramas, *ever*, but i was actually making plans to visit this again but i\u2019m having trouble *looking* at any photo or video related to this drama now. it hurts to even *think* about twenty-five twenty-one. i *trusted* you, writer-nim, but the events that transpired in ep 16 have given me *actual* trauma. thanks for taking away something that i dearly loved just for your own satisfaction. thanks for making me believe that every bond i develop now will fade into nothing in the future, and that i\u2019ll be miserable in said future even if i peak right now. thanks for giving me false hope. have a good freaking life.\n\nedit: grammar &amp; stuff. also i\u2019m still upset. and pissed.",

It's like he has self fulfilled the prophecy...if he had stayed in sports, he wouldn't have had to go to NYC. And it wouldn't be unreasonable either since Heedo already told him in that tunnel (Yurim's graffi incident) that she accepted that his job was a reporter and her job was a fencer. Heedo didn't have any scandal and ultimately had a very successful athlete career. If anything, him covering her news would be even more special because he understood her motivation more than anyone else. If he had covered the Heedo and Yurim in Madrid, imagine what a beautiful and satisfying segment it would have been since he was the one that covered their controversial first match too. That follow up story would have been a milestone in his career itself, instead of him finding solace in cigarettes and alcohol all by himself in NYC. \n\nAnd it's not like he had to report news only about fencing, he could have just switched the sport \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI can't stop feeling hurt by all the possibilities the show could have ended differently but still got the message right.",

While I did love the episodes, I loved reading all the comments that were here and thinking about the show. Hopefully this show can end on a high note (and for my own selfish interest, a BaekDo ending, although I don't expect one at this point).\n\nEdit: Did not end on a high note\u2026 loved the show until this past weekend. Disappointed BaekDo didn\u2019t end up together but that\u2019s not what soured the show for me. Just a lot of unanswered questions.",

            "comment": "I know everyone\u2019s emotions are running high now, but I thought the ending was beautiful yet bittersweet! It all made sense in the end, even though I had wished for a happier outcome like everyone else. \n\n**Heedo and Yijin**: \n\n&gt;!I would have loved to see our main couple make it, but I understand why that didn\u2019t happen. Heedo grew up incredibly lonely with a deceased parent and another parent who was often absent from her life due to professional commitments. The reason she broke up with BYJ is not because he stayed behind in New York or because he couldn\u2019t support her as before, but it\u2019s because she realised that his work and her career as an athlete would always hinder what she wants from a romantic partner. She wanted someone who could give her time, presence, and attention. However, she knew from her experience with her mother that Baek Yijin will always have to work hard for incredibly long hours just like her mum did. He will need to prove to his colleagues at work that he deserves his place in that newsroom, and he can\u2019t do that by having lesser workload. This job is super important to Yijin, especially given that he\u2019s a high school graduate and the primary breadwinner of a family of four. So he will always have to prioritise his work everything else. And Heedo will be a world class athlete who\u2019ll be training and travelling the world. She didn\u2019t want a partner who couldn\u2019t prioritise her because of work (repeating her traumatic history with her mom) and good on her to know that sooner than later !&lt; \n\n**Yurim and Jiwoong**: \n\n&gt;! I know a lot of people think their ending was unrealistic, but their ending made sense to me. Jiwoong was willing to build his whole life around Yurim from day 1 since the day she left for Russia and it\u2019s no wonder that they stuck together no matter what. I also don\u2019t mind that Yurim was able to come back to Korea and open up her own fencing club. It had been a decade or so since she changed nationalities and i am sure it was appreciated that she came back to her roots when her financial situation was more favourable. !&lt; \n\n\n\n**Seungwan**:\n\n&gt;! How incredible that our best girl Seungwan is still working in the media! And I hope she was endgame with Yijin\u2019s brother, her interactions with Yijin as in-laws would be so hilarious! !&lt;\n\n**Baekdo vs Jirim**: \n\n&gt;! I know a lot of people are shocked that they made it instead of Baekdo but we have to remember that Yurim doesn\u2019t have the traumatic past of bitter loneliness, of a loved one being absent from her life due to work or other reasons. And Jiwoong isn\u2019t burdened with taking care of an entire family through his work. They surely had difficulties with time, distance, and money but they were able to overcome it by working hard, being patient, and by always managing their expectations from each other. But Heedo\u2019s expectations from a partner would always be jeopardised by the nature of her and Yijin\u2019s careers, so it just sadly had to come to an end !&lt;\n\n**Special mention for Yijin\u2019s ending**: \n\n&gt;! I know how devastated he was by what he witnessed in nyc and later by their breakup, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s living a miserable life at the end. He has learnt so much from Heedo about getting back up in life many times over and we know he was able to bounce back despite the hardships he faced. All Yijin flashbacks post 2002 make it seem like that he turned out to be a well-adjusted professional and person. He had to fight hard to take care of his family and himself and by the end, it seems like it really worked out well for him, both professionally and personally. We know he\u2019s still alive and well and working at UBS as the world\u2019s hottest anchornim so we can easily say he made it big in the end !&lt;",

I don't think I've fully bawled like this for a kdrama before. \n\nAnyways, as a Baekdo endgame believer (up until the post-credits scene, yes I was one of those clowns \ud83e\udd72), I did hold on to hope that they would overcome their problems and eventually become stronger as a couple. But looking at the end in retrospect, I see where the writer was coming from.\n\nFor me, the ending between Baek Yijin and Na Heedo was an inevitable one and looking back at their journey as individuals much more closely, we see why. \n\nBaek Yijin has always been someone who showed his love and care by hiding his burdens from others and taking it all upon himself for him to bear. We see this explicitly shown in the beach scene where the Taeyang squad was able to let out their worries while he didn't, even though we see him going through so much pain at work. He didn't want to have them shoulder his burdens and was content to just listen to theirs. That's his form of love. Listening to others and being their warmth during their coldest times despite him going through the same thing. This was especially what Heedo needed at the very beginning.\n\nNa Heedo is someone who showed her love by being a person who is willing to share or take part in the burdens of others. This was simply shown through Yurim and Heedo's relationship and why they eventually turned out to be the best of friends. Yurim was willing to be vulnerable and share the deepest and darkest parts of herself and Heedo was able to bring that comfort to her, validating her love in return.\n\nI think we as viewers feel like we have been blinded by their pure love and support for each other since the beginning. They truly did love each other in every way. But we're not seeing that they were slowly transitioning into a period of their lives where unfortunately, the type of support and love they provide is unable to reach each other and ultimately just wasn't enough. Everyone has their limits and unfortunately they were put in a situation where those limits were pushed to the very edge until it broke the two of them. (cont.)",

            "comment": "I think the main issue with the ending is in its execution. If it was done better I think the viewers would have accepted this bittersweet ending.\n\n- Like most of you I think it was out of character for both Yijin and Heedo to just give up on their beautiful relationship the moment the first obstacle popped into their way. Not when Heedo was screaming \u201cI can\u2019t lose this love\u201d just an episode ago.\n\n- The props department really messed up by making mistakes like that beach photo of Heedo inexplicably appearing in adult Heedo\u2019s photo album when it was only Yijin who asked for that photo. Maybe they did it on purpose but then they should\u2019ve expected the enraged responses if they purposely led us on.\n\n- The fact that they never showed us how happy Yijin and Heedo were in their current lives. If both of them were happy I might\u2019ve accepted they were each other\u2019s pillars when they most needed it but weren\u2019t meant to be. Instead we got those vague scenes in the present timeline (Heedo\u2019s shop named 2521, neither of them wearing their wedding bands) where it just looks like neither of them really got over each other and there were still very strong lingering feelings. I mean if I was Mr Kim and saw that 2009 interview where his wife made those googly eyes at her exlover I\u2019d pretty sure question my whole existence.\n\n- The fact that Kim Taeri and Nam Joohyuk played their characters and acted their love story to the perfection makes it very hard to believe there could be anyone else who both of them would love more.",

            "comment": "One (hopefully last) comment on what ticked me off about Ep 15-16. Both leads experienced **abrupt and negative character growth** during the dating and breakup arc, AND there was no clear payoff afterwards to demonstrate the value of the breakup.\n\nThroughout the series, one of the things so attractive for me about HD and YJ and their relationship was the character growth and life lessons imparted. Besides from making me feel warm and fuzzy (or hot and bothered by YJ!), I was inspired by their unconditional support of each other - in YJ's own words, watching them led me to good places.\n\nWhen the romance buildup started in Ep 11-13, all of that was parked in service of the push-pull of will-they-or-won't-they. That was fine and necessary, as their love story was always part of the plan. Large parts of Ep 11-14 were spent on other characters.\n\nOnce in the relationship, both HD and YJ's characters **regressed** in terms of character growth.  For one I do not think that their actions came out of nowhere or were really OOC, since the flaws that let to their gradual falling apart and ugly tunnel fight have been embedded all along in their personalities.\n\nFor YJ, his (1) overprotective instincts re HD (perhaps not regarding her as an equal adult), (2) inability/aversion to revealing weakness/vulnerability/pain, (3) inferiority complex about \"not being good enough\" (particularly for HD) caused the fissure on his side. In hindsight (1) and (2) have been STATIC throughout. Although HD repeatedly asked to share in his suffering, YJ has never meaningfully responded to her or progressed on that front, even further regressing in NYC due to the trauma of 911. (3) was hinted at with his comments about having to do well in his job (so that high school graduates can continue to be hired, so that HD the gold medalist won't be embarrassed by such a bf). That was probably a fair part of his motivation in applying to the NY post, to **do well** so that he will be worthy of a future with her, as evidenced by what he said in their first in-person breakup in front of her house.\n\nUnfortunately, their tunnel fight showed he was on a completely different page to her and hadn't learnt and grown. She was not looking for an impressive reporter but someone who would be present and communicate. Which brings me to her side - HD had abandonment trauma and terrible communication with her mum. She fell into the exact same pattern when dating YJ, despite being able to understand him earlier and YR when she did not respond to emails, and even despite achieving some degree of reconciliation with her mother at that point in the story. It may be that her expectations are different for a romantic partner (fair enough). Although the blame probably lies more with YJ as he appeared to be not picking up her calls for months/weeks on end. But HD was also shown lying about her true feelings repeatedly. This is a clear regression in her characterisation.\n\nI'm not sure what message viewers are expected to take from this arc, when such a big deal was made of them \"falling in love\" at 21/25 in the promotions, when the drama was supposedly about first love. What does it mean that they were actually better people and better to each other before they got together? The message seems to be that they should have stayed \"in love\" but as platonic soulmates.\n\nI think the worst part, and what made the 2009 and 2021 scenes deeply dissatisfying, was that there was no clear character growth due to the breakup. Functionally, you have to give the viewers SOME emotional payoff. That could be achieved by either a happy ending (which would be too incompatible with the writer's intention) or showing the leads achieving some growth and learning from the breakup. For YJ that may be showing him getting counselling, or sharing his difficulties more openly with people. For HD that may be dating someone who's more present and shares his ups and downs with her, and being more communicative and honest in romantic relationships.\n\nWe were given neither, and in fact got hints to the contrary, with HD's husband absent (not even a phone call to suggest he was present / they communicate well / she's happy), the choice to have the one comment she makes at the funeral be about divorce, and YJ seemingly still a single workaholic. There were lines by older HD at the end where she described everything they experienced, love and friendship, at that age as \"practice\". Viewers needed to be shown the **results**, however briefly, of that practice after being put through multiple traumatic breakup scenes. Unfortunately we were almost entirely left to speculate about their interiority in 2009 and 2021 (older HD seems content! She seems lonely! YJ seems psychologically better! He wasn't shown smoking! Etc.).\n\nWe needed to see with our own eyes that the breakup was worth it, that at least they took something from it, dammit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "&gt;!I actually feel sick to the stomach. I really think they could have \u2014 even should have \u2014 ended up together. But it\u2019s more that their break-up was so damn realistic that the heart-fluttering highs of the earlier episodes are built into the knowledge of such an end. What do you mean, even *they broke up in the same way I did*. I\u2019m not angry at the writer, I\u2019m exhausted that I\u2019m still in my youth. I kept thinking Heedo was being selfish, but that\u2019s the point. Break-ups *are* selfish. They\u2019re selfish and courageous.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!By doing this, it makes me wonder if my first love was just as beautiful as theirs. And maybe in another ten years time, I\u2019ll be able to look fondly at that time because even more time has passed. But no, right now, it\u2019s still raw. Each of the callbacks to their relationship in front of the cherry blossoms and tunnel killed me. Their acting blew me away.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!I honestly don\u2019t know what the takeaway is by having them split. So much that burned bright about their relationship has gone up in flames and it didn\u2019t *have to*. I dealt with Episodes 14-15 being dark \u2014 with *Yijin* being dark \u2014 because I expected a resolution that had Yijin and Heedo come back together, loving each other in all ways!!&lt;\n\nEdit: (breathes) \n\nOkay, so. &gt;!Yijin\u2019s pencil case gets replaced and he has colleagues who don\u2019t know about his ardent love with Heedo. On the other hand, this boy who only believed in gravity not only managed to bring his family back together through the money he earnt, but in fact found a dream and succeeded in it, and the times even helped him secure that dream. Furthermore, he managed to go to the funeral in person, even though it was after everyone had left, and so isn\u2019t wholly repeating the same mistakes as the older generation. He\u2019s got a healthy support network of people more than just Heedo again: family, colleagues. I guess they are important somethings.!&lt;\n\nTurns out, Yijin and Heedo gave each other everything they wanted and needed at that time of their life. Families repaired, dreams gotten, career goals achieved. &gt;!All they didn\u2019t get is each other.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!I\u2019m still heartbroken though!!!!! I\u2019ve decided that Heedo is currently divorced (what daughter is that obsessed with her mum\u2019s love story otherwise), and that the dumb cookie ending is suggesting that now they\u2019re adults, they can have another go at this. Everything prior to this was just practice for the real thing, BYE!!!!&lt;",

            "comment": "I've been thinking how best to respond after being caught up in the whirlwind that was *Twenty-Five Twenty-One*. It has taken me at least 24 hours, to say the least, but I think I'm ready.\n\nOverall: This has definitely been one of my favourite dramas of all time. As someone that grew up in the 90s, there was the right amount of nostalgia to make me really believe the stories era. As well, I think everyone can agree, the cast was spectacular. The main leads, Nam Joo Hyuk and Kim Tae Ri, were exceptional and I couldn't imagine anyone else to be Baek Yi Jin and Na Hee Do. The range of emotion for both actors had me right along with them the entire journey. And what a journey it was. I had this drama on my list to watch, almost immediately when news of it was released. The storyline seemed interesting, and I was a previous fan of Nam Joon Hyuk's work (Start-Up and Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo). How naive I was to go into this show, thinking I could just happily watch it on the weekends as part of my usual relaxing weekend routine. How wrong I was! I was immediately drawn into the characters, the story, and everything else. I found myself uncharacteristically reading subreddits and tweets in advance of the next episodes, just to get a glimpse of what would happen next. I had never been this excited about a drama before. I was happy to stumble upon this subreddit as it provided a lot of laughs and mutual feelings about what was unfolding. And for that, I thank you all. With my regular life being as stressful as it was these past few weeks, I came here to laugh, cry, shout (in agreement), and every emotion in-between. It has been overall a wonderful experience.\n\nFinale: Note-I'm going to highlight all of this as spoilers, not so much because I will reveal key plot points from this episode, but because I want those who haven't seen this to really watch it with fresh eyes and not be influenced by anything I might say.&gt;! It took me almost 24 hours to process the ending. I definitely went through a wave of emotions. I was heartbroken like most of the audience, with not having BaekDo Endgame. It was definitely the \"nail in the coffin\" to say the least, for the ending scene to be Baek Yi Jin typing Na Hee Do's name as his forgotten password question. I was angry because not only did I think I deserved a happy ending, but because I really hoped (and was equally convinced) they would end up together. However, now I have finally accepted that this needed to be. Na Hee Do and Baek Yi Jin\u2019s relationship began due to the times (IMF Crises in Korea) and ended because of the times (9-11). It was unfortunate that they were caught up in the middle of it all, but the process was beautiful. I was overwhelmed with love for the development of Na Hee Do and Ko Yu Rim\u2019s friendship as well as the entire friend group to grow together. It would have been nice to see them all in present day, but I realized this was not a story about them. It was about Na Hee Do through the lens of youthful ambition and innocence. During that brief moment she was able to overcome her loneliness and experience friendship, success, and love. Not everyone is as lucky to experience that at such a young age. I can understand why the older Na Hee Do is content with her life. She might not have remembered all of the details (i.e. the beach trip with her friends was 21 years prior to 2020), but who remembers every detail of their adolescence. She is lucky, however, she was able to document it with photos and diaries so she could travel back to that time at any moment. This finale was definitely not perfect, but I think I can finally close this chapter and look forward to what next project are in store for the cast, director, and writer. They all did a wonderful job and I could say, the result was brilliant.!&lt;\n\nApologies for this post being so long. I just needed to process all of this somewhere :)",

I was deeply upset after the ending but after speaking and sharing on this thread I felt tons better until I say some clips on Instagram and the rage returned. I'm glad I'm not the only one whose heart hearts . It may be illogical but the audiences got really attached to the characters and wanted the best for them.\n\nI'll try and summarize why viewers are still reeling.\n\n1. The breakup was not executed well. The cracks were not explicitly laid out for the audiences to see in earlier episodes.\n2. The show has been about hope but it left on a note of hopelessness.\n3. The adult characters were not seen to be living a 'happy' life but rather simply existing.\n4. Some aspects were in characters (like, decisive decisions on Heedo's part, hiding own suffering by BYJ, etc) but other traits which was shown clearly earlier which were their ability to communicate was not utilized correctly.\n5. The writer had a theme and ending in mind but the story the characters wanted to tell got away from the story telling. \n6. The soulmate love story became too magnanimous for the planned ending. \n\nThe tunnel conversation was fine (yet painful) as they were freely communicating but the eventual good bye felt wrong. Perhaps YiJin read her diary and wanted to protect her by letting her go which makes it even sadder. When they met again, they could have talked through it. they were good at it! The differences were not irreconcilable. They could have even left a small crumb in 2022 that perhaps they were together as friends or something more in the epilogue rather than a security question. \n\nI'm hoping that I'll feel better eventually but it is not the time now. I keep seeing posts from a few people saying that the ending was good and that the complainers are idealistic young  inexperienced viewers. I'd disagree and how a person reacts to something is personal and different. Relegating feelings to age and experience is frankly insulting. Call them sensitive or idealistic but young/inexperience is demeaning and presumptuous.",

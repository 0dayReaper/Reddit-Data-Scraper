            "comment": "Gosh! I cackled through both the episodes. Don't think I have laughed so much in a BL ever!\n\n&gt;!I was immediately put off by the way Jun treated his sweet blind date. So when HaRam showed him the mirror in the meeting I clapped. And then HaRam showed that it's just the beginning of his audacity! The way he became a pest and went after Jun with single minded focus had me rolling on my bed holding my tummy \ud83d\ude02!&lt;\n\nIs this borderline harassment? Yes. But that's where it helps when it's two boys instead of a girl and a boy. Also HaRam is Jun's junior, so it's not like he is taking advantage of his position. Or maybe I'm excusing disturbing behavior because I'm enjoying it so much \ud83d\ude48\n\nSo this was a lovely beginning \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb  A teeny complaint I have is that the one playing HaRam is a weak actor and comes across as blank at times. But thankfully the writing is so strong that it helps cover his lack of acting skills. MDL says he is only 20 so I guess he can be given a pass. Was surprised to see Jun's actor is 28. He looks younger than HaRam!",

    "postText": "I just finished the show and I enjoyed it for the most part as it was a slow-burn which seems to be rare in Kdramas but they're my favourite form of romance, but the ending left me a bit confused and unfulfilled although I do think overall it's pretty clear they stay together I am curious as to what other people thought of the ending, I've already seen some discourse about it which I'd like to discuss here and see what other people think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main thing is whether or not Hae-won stays in Seoul of course, which just isn't that clear, but I do think with the tone of the last 10 minutes, they're trying to show, but not tell, that she does stay, it's just that they didn't execute it very well, i've also heard that the book the show is based on is pretty clear they stay together and idk why they'd deviate from that. However, I do also think that even if she does go back to Seoul for work, there's no reason that a LDR wouldn't work between them, people seem to be convicned that her going back to Seoul would ruin things but Idg that lol? Like South Korea isn't a big country, it's not the United States, there's no reason to believe they still wouldn't see each other fairly often even if she did go back to Seoul and make it work, it's not like CLOY &gt;!either where one person is stuck in North Korea!&lt;. So to me whether she went back to Seoul or not they'd make it work either way which is why it confuses me as to why so many people seem to think it's open-ended regarding their relationship, the only really open-ended thing is if she goes back to Seoul or not but I think there's enough to suggest she doesnt, and even if she did, they'd still make it work.\n\n Also, the show never really suggested that she cared \\*that much\\* about the Cello and working in Seoul that she'd be ready to give up Eun-Seob for it, in the earlier episodes she even mentioned teaching the kids in the village, the only reason she went back to Seoul was cuz of her aunt, not because of career prospects which is soemthign else some people seem to bring up. I do think that the whole her running away and breaking up with Eun-Seob because of her aunt was stupid, but I'm used to KDramas forcing drama like this in the last few episodes at this point. \n\nThe scene on the bridge where she starts smiling and laughing after Eun-Seob asks how long she's staying,  idk what else the writers could be trying to convey other than an optimistic outlook for their relationship, again just not executed very well. Even the final monologue of the show has Eun-Seob say that happiness isnt guaranteed and not everyone finds it but hes convinced that if he keeps searching for it, he will get it eventually, with Hae-won chiming in too,  I don't get how anyone takes this ending as anything other than happy/an optimistic outlook for their relationship. I just wish the execution had been better, but to me there shouldn't be doubt about them staying together as a couple, whether it be with Hae-won staying in the village permanently or them being in a LDR which wouldn't exactly be difficult in a country as small as South Korea, I mean she was already returning to the village every winter before this anyway. It was otherwise a great show but the ending did leave me a bit annoyed for not being executed better which is frustrating.",

She asks him to smile and he asks if I smile what will you do for me? She tells him &gt;!\"I will give you a kiss after a hundred years\". When he looks at her confusedly she continues and tells him that \"lets stay with each other until then\". It is then that Eun Seop smiles at her.!&lt;\"",

            "comment": "\\*Edits because I double checked and I've been spelling a main character's name wrong. Apologies, I only saw it once months ago.\\*\n\nCompassion. Empathy.\n\nAnd maybe a little Kahlil Gibran's: \u201cIf you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were.\u201d \u201cLet there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.\" It's about unconditional love.\n\nor Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, which begins with \"Love is not love that alters where it alteration finds.....\"  and is about allowing the one you love to grow and change with time, and continuing to love them as they do.\n\nThese are the things you have to enter episode 16 with, to know why they are able to accept each other, to know why they end up together, and that yes, indeed she is staying with him forever this time.\n\nSo, I know it is painful and unpleasant and seemingly has not much to do with Mok Hae Won and Lim Eun Seop's love story, but you have to pay close attention to episodes 14 and 15.\n\nThere you find out how badly Hae Won's family's emotional isolation from her was, how unloved she felt, somehow unworthy of love, and never knowing why because no one close to her spoke of their feelings. Now we understand better why Eun Seop's love for her was so obvious to us, the viewers, while Hae Won remained seemingly oblivious and unsure for a long time. She wasn't given a lot of love openly from the people who were her closest relatives, and that she grew up with. This was the atmosphere in which she was raised.\n\nHer mother ignored her when she was growing up because she was trapped in a deep depression, and admits to Hae Won later that she was selfish and too busy trying to take care of her own self while trying to keep Hae Won from ever knowing that her father beat her mother. She was successful, and Hae Won never knew about it while he was alive, but this also kept her from understanding her mother, and her mother's love for her.\n\nHer mother goes to prison for finally killing her abusive husband. Her mother's sister, Hae Won's aunt, a famous author, had done what she had done (can't say because spoiler) and felt a tremendous sense of guilt and shame over it. This was who was left to take care of Hae Won after her father's death. This aunt couldn't give Hae Won the love and emotional guidance and care she needed because she was too guilt riddled and busy keeping the truth from Hae Won.\n\nHae Won's mother cuts both of them off when she goes to prison. The aunt moves them to a small town where hopefully Hae Won can enjoy some anonymity and a more quiet life where no one knew of the scandal, but mostly where she herself doesn't need to be reminded of it.\n\nThe drama opens with Hae Won coming back home after losing a teaching job in Seoul. She decides to stay with her aunt again for awhile until she figures out what to do next. There she meets Eun Seop again, as he now lives and runs a bookstore out of a house across the street from hers. He loved her in HS and still carries a torch for her, and over the course of the next several months they spend a lot of time together, get to know each other well and become a loving couple.\n\nAnd then the shit hits the fan.\n\nHae Won's mother gets out of prison, and her aunt, who can no longer stand the pain and guilt, does something drastic (can't say because spoiler)  and then decides she has to tell the world what she did all those years ago. As Shakespeare once wrote, \"The truth will out.\"\n\nSo all at once she is reminded of her terrible upbringing, the loneliness, the isolation, the overwhelming sadness in the air in her aunt's house. And she is told that everything she thought she knew, everything that was too terrible to bear already, was a lie. The awful truth is somehow worse than the truth she thought she knew. And she has an emotional break down.\n\nShe cannot stand to be around her mother and aunt anymore, and Eun Seop lives and breathes literature all day, discussing authors and their works with people every day. She had joined his book club, where people gathered to read and discuss a books with each other. Her aunt is about to publish a book with a terrible true life secret, for all the world to see. She had been raised to not talk about hard truths, not bring them into the light, not talk about them. How could she just go to the book club and talk about it now? Because of course everyone in that small town would know about it, read the book, and want to talk about the famous author and her \"daughter\" figure living in their midst, right?  It was the main reason she had to get away from the town, and from him as well.\n\nIt wasn't just about her aunt and mother being unbearable for her to be around, it was also unbearable for her to know the whole town would know of her aunt's terrible lies.\n\nIt was too overwhelming for her, so she had to get away. What is the truth? What is a lie? What is she even doing, thinking she deserves to be loved by someone as wonderful as Eun Seop? Is that even real? Everything is thrown up into the air.\n\nHer whole childhood, after all, had been about burying hard truth, keeping the truth and feelings carefully buried and away from the light. So there is a strong theme running through this drama of digging the past up, taking it out into the light, seeing it for what it really is.  This, and only this, will free you from the fear and pain it brought to your life.\n\nShe had to go away and think about what the truth is, what is trustworthy, what is love? in her life. Only away from Eun Seop could she see clearly who he was and what he really brought to her life. That being unconditional love. He teaches her what it is, and how to feel it.\n\nSo we go back to the Shakespeare and Gibran quotes I wrote at the top. This is how Eun Soep feels about her, this is his heart. This is why he is so easily able to take her back into his life, even after the immense sorrow he felt when she left the village again.\n\nAnd this is why the drama ends on such a joyful note. They're intensely happy because they know this time it's unconditional and forever.\n\nAnyway, just my opinion. I loved the show and found the ending very satisfying.",

I was satisfied that they, their relationship, was settled, that they were definitely a forever thing. She did have a conversation with her aunt and mother in a cafe, I think it was episode 16, where she said she wanted to go in with some school friends from college and open a music institute of her own for children. That was going to be in Seoul, she said, so it was possible she was going to work and live in Seoul and come back to the village and him on weekends. But  that conversation came just before she saw him on the street and went to see him again. Before she realized what was important was that she let the past go and  look toward a future with Eun Seop. She didn't know yet that she could accept his love and be a loving partner to him herself.\n\nHer, I think it was in HS? best friend who had betrayed her, and they were talking together in I think episode 16. This friend really wanted her forgiveness, and said something to the effect of some people have cracks (past mistakes), they're not perfect, but maybe she (Hae Won) could love them anyway.  Hae Won said nothing, just sat there thinking about it until the camera cut to a new scene. So her aunt and mother and ex-best friend had some cracks, but Eun Soep? He was her rock, his devotion to her a solid, uncracked foundation. I saw the end as her wanting to be that for him, as well, going forward.\n\nI think with this drama, what also makes the viewer love the couple more is when they have townspeople, and friends, around them who also love them and think they're good people. It can't be helped, they influence how we, the viewer, feel about the main couple. So the friends group they have, the ones who get together to drink and eat dinner and shit talk and tease each other for a few hours every few weeks. We love those characters and they love the main characters, and it reels us in further and makes us care more about the story.\n\nSo what I would say is that, when we love a drama, it is never enough sometimes. We want to KNOW exactly what happens next, because we don't really want the drama to be over, we don't want to see it end.\n\nI believe all of us romance drama watchers, myself included, have at least one drama like that. The one we can't let go because it didn't end exactly as we would have loved it to end, because we loved the couple and their life in the drama.\n\nI think this is one of those for you. On the plus side, you can imagine anything you like, so if you prefer she stays and opens a school in their town, then that is the ending. It can be whatever you want it to be. I actually prefer these kinds of open endings, but I understand they aren't what a lot of viewers prefer.",

Once you find it, it is here (analogy: the weather is always fine regardless of its unpredictability) but it can be gone just like that if we take it for granted. There is deeper meaning for the main characters that have been living comfortably their whole lives in loneliness in their own way, not knowing the meaning of happiness because they have been abandoned by their love ones (in different forms).!&lt;",

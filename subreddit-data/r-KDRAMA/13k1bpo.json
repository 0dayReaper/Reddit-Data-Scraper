There's missing story &gt;!(aka the boss POOFING)!&lt;, pacing is super weird, and &gt;!I don't mind time jumps that make sense but this one didn't. Great you worked on yourself. Fantastic. Positive representation for mental health. Also fantastic. You just obsessed/swooned after the dude with no communication after that \"break up\" for a year? Nope.!&lt; This story makes no sense.",

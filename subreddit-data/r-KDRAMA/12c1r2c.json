            "comment": "&gt;The series will revolve around PR agent Park Yoon Jo (Lee Yeon He), who lands a position at a large conglomerate. She comes from an ordinary background, yet she challenges herself in order to make her own success. While working with her best friend, Ryu Jae Min (Hong Jong Hyun), in the company's PR team, she meets her role model, Goo Yi Jung (Moon So Ri), who guides Yoon Jo through her life.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hong Jong Hyun plays the character of Jae Min, who is well-received by the PR team for his work. But unlike Yoon Jo, he knows how to separate his private life from work.\n&gt;\n&gt;Moon So Ri plays one of the best PR experts in the field, who has charisma and skills.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yunho will play the role of Seo Dong Hoon, a free-spirited CEO of a PR agency.\n\n[Source](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2022/12/688_341751.html)",

As it's a story about a PR firm I hope they have a lot of those tropes about \"turning a horrendous public image situation into a good one\" (sorry no idea how else to explain it). Also Moon So Ri was amazing and powerful in Life, I'm excited to see her again here.",

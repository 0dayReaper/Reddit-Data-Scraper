            "comment": "**From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_U_of_Goguryeo):**\n\n&gt;Queen U or romanized as Queen Woo (Hangul: \uc655\ud6c4 \uc6b0\uc528, Hanja: \u738b\u540e \u4e8e\u6c0f; d. 234), was a queen consort of Goguryeo as the wife of King Gogukcheon (Go Nammu) and later his younger brother, King Sansang (Go Yeonu), after his death. She was famous for maintaining supreme authority and power there, which even the king could not easily control. She is recognized today as an independent woman who successfully pursued her own desires, and her second marriage is a well-known example of the levirate marriage custom in Goguryeo.\n\n**From \"King Sansang\" Kings &amp; Queens of Korea (KBS World):**\n\n&gt;When King Gogukcheon died without an heir in the year 197, his queen, Lady Woo, chose her deceased husband\u2019s younger brother, Yonu and helped him to become the next king. She then became the new king\u2019s wife to once again obtain the status of queen. This shows that the custom of Levirate marriage was still practiced in Goguryeo. It is also assumed that the ambitious queen sought to continue wielding her royal power. \n\nThe KBS World article tells of a rivalry between Queen Woo and a woman who later gave birth to King Sansang's successor. King Sansang met this woman in a forest when a sacrificial rite went awry. When Queen Woo learned of this woman, she sent soldiers to kill her. **This will probably be a story arc in this drama.**",

Hopefully this is just gonna be about political stuff where she emerges as the victor . I've only recently learned about her and from what I know she was ruthless and smart and cruel too when needed and I hope they keep her that way . There is this thing where modern writers take ruthless,cruel women from history and somehow turn them into paragons of virtue who want to protect their family or something like that and I'm really hoping that bs doesn't happen.",

I haven't finished watching it yet (60 episodes!). The actress who plays the adult Queen Insu played the FL in \"The Iron Empress.\"",

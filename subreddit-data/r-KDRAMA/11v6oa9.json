An everyday fierce battle to save the club.\r  \n\r  \n**Bad Things**: it's a drama about sport, but there isn't one single sport scene.\r  \n\r  \n**Interesting Things**: the management system, the dirty tricks from people financing the club.\r  \n\r  \n**Spotlight On Because**: good main actor. The kind of guy taking amazing initiatives. Often hidding something but a smile. Slowly building confidence, as at first, everyone hate him.",

            "comment": "Wild Romance\n\nA troubled star baseball player is being stalked by a dangerous obsessive. After a video of the baseball player being beaten up by a female bodyguard (and rabid fan of his rival baseball team) goes viral, his Press team hire the bodyguard to protect him, hoping to make it seem like it was self defence training. However, sparks fly as the two bond through ups and downs. \n\nGood things: Lee Dong Wook. The FL's best friend is a genius author and also extremely weird and horny in a way that you don't see so often in more modern dramas. Good examination of what it means to sacrifice for your sport and the personal and physical toll that takes.\n\nBad things: Lee Dong Wook's goatee in the first five episodes. The stalker storyline sort of flops towards the end. There's a bipolar character that is the least realistic depiction of bipolar I've ever seen. Parts of it haven't aged well, the cinematography and the quality of the sets in particular.\n\nInteresting things: interesting examination of feminity and relationships. The FL is supposed to be relatively unattractive (of course she isn't really because Kdrama lol) but does go through a sort of feminine awakening without being sort of yassified which is how they usually do that.\n\nSpotlight on because: its lots of fun, very silly and laugh out loud. I would recommend but only as a distraction or lighthearted fun. It's not very good, from a more general viewpoint, the story is a mess, the characters are a bit one dimensional, but I found it charming and funny so I would watch again",

Now it's just them taking on cases and helping people. But I do wish they didn't tone the fights and punishments so much. I think the added humor with the S1 fights and darker backstories would've made a good balance, but it's a tad too light now. I still enjoy the show and look forward to it every week nonetheless.",

All of them had experienced losing someone they loved, and all of them had closure already.. If ever they'll be tackling a personal case, that will be of Mr. Park &amp; Mr Choi's (arson case). Therefore, it will just be one story only (2 episodes).\n\nThe team can't be as brutal as Season 1 because they almost got caught. They were also betrayed by someone Mr. Jang trusted and it almost compromised their operation. I think u are disappointed they are leaving the perpetrators alive. I think u want them to punish and torture the Season 2 perpetrators heavily, am I right? The team had learned their lesson already in Season 1 (they almost got caught by the Prosecution Office!). They will not be torturing, kidnapping, and isolating bad guys anymore---though they will be punishing them in other ways. Not disappointing really as, &gt;!most Season 2 bad guys got killed, not by them, but by the main villain (except 2nd case villain, as he was probably killed by a landmine)!&lt;\n\n&gt;And they need to give dogi more diverse characters than naive idiotic or batshit insane, like this new one is too similar to legend Wang Tao Zi. This is an insult to leeJehoon acting skills.\n\nGeez. So how do u want him to act? During undercover, he must lower the bad guys' guards and only way to do that is to act weak, insane, naive, strange or idiotic. If he acts more smarter and stronger than the villains while doing his undercover character, then the bad guys will be suspicious of him early on and it might compromise their undercover operation.\n\nI actually like that Season 2 is less gory than Season 1----they can exact revenge in many ways without being too violent. Also, I'm not focused on the action aspect--I'm more focused on overall execution of each case. And they never fail to disappoint me. Season 1 and Season 2 have different formulas, but they are equally entertaining and thrilling. If u just focus on the action and blood part, then you will be disappointed as Season 2 has less action and blood. The most important is, they are able to convey that these crimes exist (well, I believe they're loosely based or inspired on real life cases), making viewers aware.",

I wonder how much ep 7-8 getting released now is a coincidence.\n\nIt was just a coincidence. Cults crimes had always been a problem in South Korea so when they announced that there will be Taxi Driver Season 2, I was already expecting they'll have a case about cults in Season 2 (since they didn't in Season 1).\n\n&gt;The Mechanics duo is so much more than lab rats. Both of them were pretty accomplished in their own fields. The disrespect. \n\nThe disrespect? In what way? I don't think Mr. Jang, Doki, Go Eun are disrespectful of them. They are the \"machine\" aspect of the team; the 3 actually appreciate those two. The team lack manpower---so, they need to maximize their team and be ready for any undercover part, even if it means they'll be portraying difficult characters (such as cult member &amp; shaman's assistant).\n\n&gt;I kinda feel like Jang Sung Chul is the weakest character this season, previous seasons he was behind the planning but now he is just there as a team's dad?\n\nI don't think so. U just said that because he was rarely seen on this episode. He was behind the planning in Season 1 &amp; had been always behind in Season 2, along with Doki. Just like in Season 2, there were episodes in Season 1 where he was just seen for few minutes. &gt;!His presence in Season 1 has more recall because of his collaboration with Madam Baek. In Season 2 Episode 1, he was the one doing Go Eun's job until Go Eun got back; in Episode 4, his undercover character was the most crucial one in closing the case; in Episode  5 &amp; 6, he took care of the girl while the 4 were doing the revenge request. But in all episodes he can be seen planning with the team. He just doesn't have the same recall in Season 1, that is why u perceived him as the weakest character!&lt;",

            "comment": "Cross posting my thoughts here that I first posted on Tumblr.\n\nAfter watching episode 8 I'm convinced that On Ha Joon (Shin Jae Ha) it's not this season's ultimate big bad I feel like he is a leader of some sort in that evil organization but not the head honcho. Because it's weird to me that he allowed one of his associates/subordinates to question his plans in regards to the Rainbow Taxi team. He also just doesn't feel menacing enough. I know it may seem that I don't like Shin Jae Ha as an actor but that is not true I do think if he is going to be the ultimate big bad of the season he is miscast in the role. I feel like his character is probably part of the leadership team but also someone that had to work really hard to get there based on the hints we get about his backstory hence he might not have the respect of some of the higher ups in the organization.\n\nAs for the case itself the case for episode 7 and 8 didn't pack the emotional punch I was hoping for but I feel like we still had some really great moments. I especially love the fact that they're giving Go-eun more scenes outside the van.\n\nI'm really happily surprised that they're feeding us Doki-Goeun shippers so well this season this must be what Pyo Yejin meant when she said the love line is leveling up 300%. (I personally wouldn't put it that high I would say somewhere around 150% but it is definitely a noticeable leveling up for sure).\n\nThe cliffhanger has me really excited for next week. I hope it's not misleading and that they will show us how Doki came to suspect On Ha Joon. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nPlus next week we get an One Dollar Lawyer crossover with what seems like a Namkoong Min cameo. Namkoong Min must be really good friends with Lee Je Hoon in real life or perhaps they just like collaborating together because Lee Je Hoon has also cameoed in two of Namkoong Min's dramas.",

Like the flow of the episodes are kinda off and I can't place my finger on what exactly it is.\n\nI also don't like how cheesy their dialogue has become. Nothing seems serious anymore and the taxi team is always sorta throwing this humourous tone into their words. Like last season, there were some funny moments but they did it in moderation at certain moments, not every time they speak. I just feel like the thrill and seriousness has toned down way too much and I seriously miss it. Even the action scenes just don't seem as intense or satisfying anymore.\n\nI'm sorta looking forward to Ha Joon as the villain, curious about backstory and what sorta things he'll do against the taxi team. Although I'm not sure how they haven't figured him out yet\ud83d\ude2d, its SOOO obvious he's up to something.",

I felt this season isn't so intense anymore. If only they swap S1 and S2 around. I guess it will make more sense since the cases just became more intense. \n\n&gt;!Btw, Ha Joon did mentioned that Rainbow company had infiltrated both of his company. But I'm literally confused. Like how did he even got involved in the 2 rings that looks like a separated organisation. So he seems to be inferring that both organisation's bosses isn't the real boss? This is my guess thag it seems like he might be the big boss? Some parts just don't make sense, I'm hoping as the series go by it might make more sense.!&lt;",

And I agree with you, the two groups are completely different cases so it just feels strange that they're connected somehow.\n\nThe only somewhat reasonable hypothesis I can come up with is that the whole thing wasn't a coincidence. Maybe Ha Joon has an enemy that discretely prompted the Rainbow Team into covering those specific cases somehow to take him down? But even that feels like a stretch, idk. Or maybe it was Ha Joon himself but that makes no sense, because otherwise he wouldn't have complained to Do Gi about how this \"bully\" keeps taking down his \"younger brothers\". Unless he's secretly a good guy and has an even bigger boss that he wants to take down so he tries to be obvious on purpose, but that too feels like a stretch.\n\nOr maybe the most simple reason is that Ha Joon himself is such a huge boss that his organizations are spread out everywhere in different areas of crime, hence why the probability of the Taxi Team covering more than one of his organizations increased.\n\nWell whatever the case is, I guess we'll see.",

Literally ep 1&amp;2 was so far the most intense eps out of the whole series. \n\nIt was literally riding a downhill roller-coaster that shoots up too soon. \n\nBut I understand that the writer is aiming for more relevant stories closer to our daily lives. That's why maybe the stories had toned down a lot compared to S1.\n\nBut this season really have more laughing points than intensity. \n\nHow the father decided to listen to monk KDK \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 and \ngive him all the money he has just to make his life longer. And from how he at first think they were a cult to believing them was so hilarious. \n\nHowever, this still shows that he still cares for himself only. I don't think he got the deserved punishment lol. Though the only punishment he got was that he became broke \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I wonder where they will bring them to store lol. \n\nAlso the last part of ep 8, I believe that !&gt;KDK actually got his hint when the new taxi driver told him about his story about how his little brothers were beaten up by people whom have no relation to his brothers. And whether if he should befriend the people who beaten his brothers.!&lt;\n\nKDK is a guy who is very fast to take people's cues. So I'm sure he should be able to get it that the new driver is here for his revenge. However, I'm guessing he might act like he don't know and come out with a detailed plan to bring down him?",

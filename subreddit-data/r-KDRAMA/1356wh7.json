Morally grey, edgily infatuated, vulnerable yet venomous second female lead antagonist. Her can\u2019t look away from the trainwreck dysfunctional primary relationship. An ending I didn\u2019t see coming. Tastefully blurred \u201cnaked\u201d one against all shower melee.\n\n**Bad Things** \u2014 Even lord of both action and romance Ji Chang Wook doing his best can\u2019t put an effective loveline into a script that doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d romance. Also, why do they make Yoona\u2019s character constantly scream and yell when Yoona\u2019s a skilled actress who is well able to use more subtle modalities? Notably awkward ramen sequence. That ice cream scene.\n\n**Interesting Things** \u2014 Subway PPL in a dream, people!\n\n**Spotlight On Because** \u2014 Nuthin\u2019 wrong with those action scenes! Great performances from everyone whose role is written in a way that gives them something to work with. Ji Chang Wook. I recommend this without reservation to fans of straight up action. If you\u2019re a romance fan, too, like me, you\u2019re faced with deciding if the poorly written romance is going to ruin the drama for you. I watched it and I\u2019m not sorry, not one bit.",

I like them *better* with it (I'm looking at you, group shower scenes in **Hwarang**), but it can't save it if, as you say, the writers just don't *get* romance.",

The politics is great, and the action scenes are pretty fantastic. So many cliff-hangers, yes, sometimes quite literally. The climax, especially, lives rent-free in my head, even though I saw it so long ago. And the romance is not shoe-horned in, like many other action plots, but actually plays a major part in the ML's revenge arc.\n\n**Bad Things**: Not exactly a \"bad thing\" but yes, since this is an older drama (2011), the production is not as good as newer dramas like, say, Vincenzo. But it doesn't really take away from the viewing experience.\n\n**Interesting Things**: The evolution (redemption?) of the ML, aka Lee Min Ho's Daddy issues.\n\n**Spotlight On Because**: while I see a lot of newer dramas being recommended (and they're all great!) and dramas like the Healer getting a lot of love (with reason - I love that one too!), not a lot of people like to watch older dramas - and I think this one is definitely worth it!",

            "comment": "Although it feels like all sageuks could end up somewhere in this category, I'm speaking up for **My Country: The New Age** (2019).\n\n**Summary.** Extremely loosely based on the transition period between Goryeo and Joseon periods, two best friends - Seo Hwi (Yang Se-Jong) and Nam Seon-Ho (Woo Do-Hwan) - end up clashing after a series of political intrigues and misunderstandings and straight-up mistakes that the characters make.\n\n**Good Things:**  The fights! The eye candy! Soooo much blood! One of the things I love about this drama is how close the characters are, and how as they age and the story progresses, they actually come to realize some of their screw-ups and *repent and change*. I am a huge sucker for a good redemption arc! Especially when the conflicts are externally driven, e.g., nobody would just stab their best friend for no reason but if they have a *reason...*\n\n**Bad Things:** A little too much romance, but not enough to wreck it. The FL (Seol Hyun) is actually interesting and proactive, not just a helpless font of tears and fish kisses. The ending was satisfying if emotionally destructive, but I did get the feeling they needed either fewer than 16 episodes, or a couple more. \n\n**Interesting Things:** I have come to expect a lot of miraculous healing in sageuks, but man, MC:TNA takes the cake. They grab blades with both hands and then grip their sword no problem in the next scene. *A character will stab another straight through with a sword, and the stabee will stick a bandage on it and never be affected again.* \n\nThe fact that the chracters could take so much damage and never seem to die from it made me so paranoid that I was on edge every single moment until the finale. If you rewatch it, I learned that &gt;!they only die if they blorp the blood out of their mouths; literally no blood no foul. !&lt;\n\nEvery single side character was interesting to me, and take a look at the cast list if you need any more motivation. Not just the leads, but the antagonists are so very very evil! Jang Hyuk, Kim Young-Chul, Ahn Nae-Sang, Ji Seung-hyun, Jang Young-Nam, Lee Hyun-Kyun... okay, you can look it up yourself because every actor is amazing even in the smallest roles!\n\nA nice bloody sageuk with no zombies.",

What\u2019s hardest for me is how well serious sageuks layer the brutality with betrayal and soul-destroying emotional and psychological agony. Hardcore historical melodrama is worse for me than severed limbs. I can watch Evil Dead type funny horror with more ease, although it does make me more prone to anxiety. I made it through most films directed by John Woo\u2014including **Bullet in the Head**. I find it much less painful to watch his films and other narratives of the sort with their showers of bullets and high adrenaline, sensational thrills. **Man from Nowhere** worked well for me, too, even with its darker world and more loathsome villains. I\u2019ve seen a handful of Kitano Takeshi\u2019s films, too, and I was emotionally in one piece at the end. But the longer format of sageuks, and the creators\u2019 skill in building the affective worlds of the characters and then irreparably breaking them emotionally\u2014that decimates me.",

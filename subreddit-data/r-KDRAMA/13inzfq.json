In her 19th life, Ban Ji Eum decides to find a man named Moon Seo Ha who she met in her 18th life.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ahn Bo Hyun stars as Moon Seo Ha, who lives with the trauma of losing his loved ones as a child. His first love who helped him get through this trauma was Yoon Joo Won (played by Kim Si Ah), which was Ban Ji Eum in her 18th life. Moon Seo Ha lives a solitary life after Yoon Joo Won\u2019s death, but everything changes when Ban Ji Eum mysteriously appears in front of him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ha Yoon Kyung plays Yoon Joo Won\u2019s younger sister Yoon Cho Won, while Ahn Dong Goo plays Ha Do Yoon, Moon Seo Ha\u2019s loyal secretary and longtime friend.\n\n[Source](https://www.soompi.com/article/1583582wpp/watch-shin-hye-sun-ahn-bo-hyun-and-more-introduce-their-upcoming-fantasy-drama-in-1st-making-of-clip)",

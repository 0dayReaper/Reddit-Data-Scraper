            "comment": "**Let's Eat 1** (2013) (Food/Slice of Life/Noona RomCom/Mystery): Neighbors to found family story revolving around shared meals where FL and ML slowly come to like and rely on each other through daily shenanigans. \n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The dramatic monologues. ML is a food blogger, and when someone has a question/is misinformed/does something incorrectly involving food he literally steals the camera and gives an impassioned dissertation to clarify. It's obnoxious and delightful. \n* The food culture. It doesn't just focus on elaborate restaurant dishes or famous Korean standbys but also the simple homemade meals and cheap convenience food that feature in busy daily life. It's all worthy to ML and FL, and it all looks equally delicious. \n* The neighborhood feel. FL, ML and SFL live next door to each other in an officetel and their little luxuries are the meals share with each other. FL is a tsundere, but ML and SFL warm up to her quickly and their relationship is sweet despite the love triangle.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The 'fatty'. TFL isn't fat or ugly but she's crassly treated like she is.\n* The SML. He's an emotionally immature bully propped up as a serious love interest. \n* The trope bingo plot. It's not a story so much as a mish-mash of popular narrative elements. There's office drama and a murder mystery and family conflict and a chaebol corruption scandal and while they individually sort of make sense none of it ever comes together. The only continuity is in the character relationships.\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* It was popular enough to green light two more seasons as well as a spin-off involving drinking culture (**Drinking Solo**), which is a wild success by Kdrama standards.\n* The first two seasons are currently available for free on Youtube/Cereal.\n\nIt's a 7/10 from me. It's light on story, so watch it for the food or the characters; if neither of those appeal, you're not really missing anything. But it's a fun, easy watch as long as you're not hungry and willing to take it at face value.",

I think Let's Eat 2 includes some foreign dishes and 3 had a lot of raw fish dishes. If you get a chance, watch season 3 with all the flashbacks to college days, you see where he got his habit of explaining dishes. Fun, light dramas!",

            "comment": "**Witch's Diner** (2021) (Fantasy/Food/Slice of Life/Revenge): A witch who grants pricey wishes through fantastical dishes sets up shop in FL's old restaurant; both ML and FL end up working for her after she fulfills a wish for each of them. \n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The dark fantasy vibe. When it comes to aesthetics, it's on par with **Hotel Del Luna**. Not as high budget; but between SFL's haute fashion, the gothic architecture of the restaurant and the phantasmagorical cinematography it's visual feast even without the food.  \n* The mother/daughter relationships. There are two mothers struggling to do right by their daughter, which is a welcome change from the more contentious parent/child dynamics usually showcased in Kdrama.\n* The ostentatious meals. If baroque was a style of cooking, SFL would be considered a master. Her dishes flaunt the line between irresistible and grotesque which just accentuates the cautionary fairy-tale theme. \n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The fraction of a story. It's 8 episodes at 40 minutes each, which less than half a standard Kdrama. There's a suggestion of a deeper plot and a more complex magical world, but all that's shown is the cliff notes version and it's really not enough. Likewise, the closure for the main characters was hasty and feels incomplete.\n* The unrequited love. There's not one but two one-sided romances - &gt;!ML's noona crush on FL and SML's steadfast devotion to SFL!&lt; - which is a bit much for such a short series.\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* It has a very Ghibli-esque vibe - fantasy with a seedy underbelly (and lots of food) - that's rare in Kdramas.\n\nIt's an 7.5/10 from me. Short but not sweet and dark but not depressing. Recommended if you prefer heavier fantasy dramas like **Hotel Del Luna**, don't mind some thwarted romance and enjoy seeing people get exactly what they wished for.",

            "comment": "Business Proposal\n\nGood Things\n* The chemistry between the two main actors is just beautiful . They fit really well together .\n* The 2nd couple is funny and adorable and shows how women can be embarrassed by things and how even men can  over think too.\n* It teaches you compassion for your partner.\n* The love story may have its fairytale moments but it's still a beautiful story of two people who come together under interesting circumstances but find a way to connect and see past that .\n* It's really funny it makes me laugh every time I watch it.\n\nBad point\nThe only bad angle I really don't like is how the issue of one being wealthy and the other not seems to make people.skeptical of their relationship . I understand that it still happens it just makes me sad.\n\nI think this show deserves the spotlight because the main lesson is finding someone you can feel comfortable with and just simply be yourself is more important than some one who matches in wealth and family background. If you can find someone who you love and they love you and both and care for each other and support one another that real love and I feel this shows that beautifully and also gives comic moments to ease the tension.",

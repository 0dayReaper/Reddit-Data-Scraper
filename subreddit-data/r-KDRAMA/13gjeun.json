The way yeon and shinju kept making fun of rang was priceless. It surprises me how lee dongwook can shed his pretty boy image just for an all out comedic scene and the dude playing shinju is just hella funny. \n\nLee Miho is the best thing to ever happen in this series. The gambling scenes with rang were too adorable for words. I really hope they keep her throughout this drama and not just some passingby character.\n\nAlso, appreciation shout out for rang\u2019s sidekick. That rickshaw scene from the last episode still cracks me up whenever i think about it. He\u2019s also one loyal bandit to rang and yeon.",

Episode four made me reach completely new heights of happiness, I love the interactions between Rang, Yeon and Shin Joo. Learning all the lore, seeing snippets of their lives before. And that little beautiful bundle of happiness!!! She\u2019s so adorable, I hope Rang keeps her \ud83e\udd79 He deserves happiness and experiences beyond the resentment Yeon\u2019s abandonment created. \n\nI\u2019m going to be completely honest\u2026 I didn\u2019t watch S1 because I don\u2019t like the female lead, I dropped it after episode two I think, and only saw interesting snips that became popular. I gave a chance to S2 because I love Shing Shing (the mountain god lady) and the Lee brothers (their dynamic was what attracted my attention from S1). I\u2019m enjoying everything on this season now that the FL from before is out. I dislike seeing who Yeon became because of heartbreak, the promises and hearts he broke. It adds so much depth to the plot the fact that we\u2019re seeing characters that he hurt because of his pain, and him /kind/ of making amends. I cried watching the little girl in the box, and him apologizing. I cant wait to keep seeing how now that he\u2019s at peace because he has Jiah, he touches people lives in a kinder way.",

I think they're doing a good job interrogating the negative ripple effects of Yeon's pain over his loss without invalidating the central romance for those of us who do actually really like Yeon/Ji Ah as a couple (there are dozens of us...dozens).    \n\nAfter episode 4 I was also thinking that each of the three mountain gods have spent hundreds of years obsessively, destructively fixated on dead or unattainable romantic partners, and Lee Rang has apparently been celibate his entire life, and I'm wondering how much of this is a trauma response to how they were treated by the adults in their lives as children and the losses they suffered during these formative years.\n\nThat they've included these hints of melancholy in such a zany, high octane action comedy without wrecking the giddy fun tone of the show (and these episodes are so cute and funny) is a real accomplishment to me.  I was super hyped for this show before it aired which I was worried about because sky high expectations can lead to disappointment but I've been so happy with the quality of the show so far.",

It was Lee Yeon who wasn't written that well for me in S1 lol. But I'm one of those ppl who roll my eyes at immortal characters that are fixated on love and relationships. Like, come on... In S2, he's much better and more emotionally available to the people around him... it's like he's mellowed out and more thoughtful.\n\nLee Rang strikes me as emotionally stunted. He does a fair bit of externalizing of his emotions when the character as a child seemed like he's naturally an inward type. Actually, there's something wrong with nearly all of the non-human characters lol. Only Shin Joo is consistently the most human in his empathy. The actress Kim Yong Ji is doing a nice job of differentiating Eun Ho and Yoo Ri, in which the former is restrained and the latter rather feral. I love her and hope she's not wasted.\n\nI love Kim So Yeon in any role she plays. Stating that explicitly in case it seems like I'm ignoring her lol. She's just so charismatic and fits in with all the other charismatic actors/characters.",

Girl, go get your love!\n\nI'm still confused about foxes and dating and foxes and mates and the whole true to one mate thing. Seems like Dad was a man who lived by his own rules? How can there be a half human child that's so much younger if there's a one soul mate rule? Maybe foxes can have multiple sexual partners but maybe one soul mate? \n\nI really like that Hong Joo is always dropping reveals that she's a lot deeper than the one-sided love. There seems to be a lot of pain in her past. Actually, her and the tiger dude are implied to have had more tragic back stories than Lee Yeon. So I'm interested in learning more about them.\n\nI know this is supposed to be time travel...but a multiple worlds scenario seems to make more sense in my head.",

It's definitely an interesting question I want answers for.  \n\n\nI actually really like Hong Joo, when she's not assaulting and harassing Yeon.

My level of enjoyment seesaws wildly between (and sometimes within) episodes as I'm watching.  I like it a lot less than this show so far, but I understand why it could generate more conversation.\n\nI feel like a show like that might be at the sweet spot from a commenting perspective, something that's good enough that you don't drop it, but flawed enough there's a lot of criticize.

After all, Yeon wasn\u2019t supposed to meet Rang until at least a century later. Them meeting right now and having Yeon make amends will impact a hundred years of decisions Rang makes. Had they not meet in episode one, and Yeon make him change in his appearance and have him in town, Rang and the mermaid wouldn\u2019t have met. I think this is creating the opportunity of Rang finding his lover.",

I feel like only Yeon's, Shin-Ju's and Moo-Yeong's life would be affected (since they all came from the same timeline!&lt;). I'm thinking Rang would have his own life - probably with the mermaid in 1938 but with no memory Yeon? And Yeon would come back contented with the fact that Rang's not alone. Just a guess though.\n\nAnd who knows, the mission would become successful and Rang would re-incarnate in the original timeline!",

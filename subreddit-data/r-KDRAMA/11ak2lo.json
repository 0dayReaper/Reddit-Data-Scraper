Idk how they did it, but they somehow managed to capture the essence of modern idol makeup, while also adding old trends like dark eyeliner. Homeboy looks like he could have debuted in 2nd/early 3rd gen. \n\nHe's already handsome, but the diverse makeup and hairstyles really accentuates his features. Every recent appearance he's had on interviews and variety shows has made me do a double take.",

It's quite unfair that he has such a beautiful smile - and I totally agree with you on making him so effortlessly idol-esque. That first scene when he appears in this world - somehow instead of looking kitschy he looked ethereal?? \n\nThere was some trivia that he was training for a while with what eventually became Seventeen but decided to drop out from the idol race because he didn't think his dancing was that great. Well good for me because now we get to see him acting AND singing too!\n\nI really hope they keep getting him to sing for every subsequent episode and then release the songs because the songs are just so good",

I guess it's been awhile since I've read fan translations instead of the official trans, but it got me thinking...\n\nAt what level of enthusiast does it become standard to include honorifics? Obviously for casual kdrama viewers, it's difficult to always explain them, but at what point does it become to norm to leave the oppas, hyungs, unnies, etc etc in untranslated form? I was surprised to see that the ToG fantrans dont do them. The officials dont either but the officials use the weirdest romanizations, so they've always been a bit trash. In most animes and mangas, I feel like most people can understand the -kuns, -chans, senpais, etc without footnotes.\n\nI don't really watch jdoramas or cdramas as much, do they leave them in there too? I feel like I remember seeing \"big sis\" or surname-san in the subs more than given names.\n\nHonorifics and formal speech indicators really help translate contexts in ways that even spoken tone doesnt quite convey. At least in dramas we can hear them, but I really wish subs included them more.",

And while English dubs are usually grating and inaccurate, I LOVE the Hindi ones.\n\nUnlike English, I've noticed that Hindi dubs better capture what's happening on screen, with dialogues actually matching what the characters are saying and doing instead of a flattened out literal translation. The inflections, the emotions, everything flows better. Frequently I even prefer it over the English subtitles, and English is my first language.\n\nOne of my favorite translation moments is when the frustrated Vincenzo yells at Inzaghi: *\"Ye tere baap kee khidakee he kya?\"* (Is this your father's window?) Like, it's only funny in Hindi, but it's FUNNY. Dubs should fully capitalize on language-specific jokes instead of being generic and awkward.\n\nObviously I can't speak for other languages, so what do yall think of non-English dubs?

My family watches a lot of Turkish dramas dubbed in Hindi so in the times that I've happened to see parts of those, I thought they were done well. I think the language is nuanced enough to match the tone of the scenes and still find ways to incorporate things like formality, both of which are mostly missing in English and can result in a more dry translation.\n\nPersonally I am loyal to subtitles as I don't like watching in a language other than the original so I don't think I'll be converting to dubs anytime soon. My Korean is not the best, but I understand enough of it now where I can at least pick up on some mistranslations and small things that might be missed when watching with English subtitles. I don't feel like I'm missing out on much since I'm also actively listening to the dialogue instead of just making all of my judgements based on the subtitle text so that kind of makes up for it. \n\nI would love to go back though and rewatch a kdrama with Hindi dubs as an experiment to see how they approach it!",

Or do they use wires and a crane and all that? It seems to me to be more expensive to set up, but what do I know. \n\nI haven't recognised suicide places from different dramas to be the same. Maybe they just go on top of a low house on a hill, so that it looks like it is high up?",

            "comment": "I don't even want to argue, and I hate drama, but I'm tired of being chat restricted on the only thread I care about for more than 3 weeks in a row. Crash Course in Romance.\nMods gave me a warning/strike on something that was resolved between the parties and a notice/headsup on a different comment but both of them seemingly mild and quick to end hours before the mods even looked at it.\nIf I ask, I get a 10 letter page documentary DM (I ask for clarification not a novel) on how they moderated it like I have so much time to spend reading it and arguing back and forth, including blatantly asking us to block each other. That to me is shockingly encouraging more poor quality behaviour, certainly not a boastful conduct from a community. I was more pissed that I was messaged by the mods because they are the ones who escalated the matter.  \nThe most infuriating thing is after all this time I wasn't informed of being chat restricted or maybe I have in the wall of text but it's been weeks and not being told for a \"minor\" misconduct and that's a valid \"punishment\"?  \nThe closest I can find from websearch is me being individually blocked because every other poster works fine.  \nHow it works? It appears perfectly fine in my end but everyone else it's hidden/deleted if you have the direct link. After a few hours, it appears normally, after being manually mod? approved.  \nIt's not even from the mod I spoke to so I can't help but think it's mod abuse and it should be called out.\n\nI want to let everyone know I can no longer enjoy this community the same way again and hope your experience will always be better than mine.\n\n---\n\nEdit:  \nSo after repeatedly trying to end the conversation (this comment thread) which only aims to make mods look sane and me a villain, I'm *permanently banned* from r/kdrama (not being informed exactly why, because of course there isn't a good reason) **within** the hour of my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/11ak2lo/the_weekend_wrapup_022423_to_022623/ja03jzl/) and reported to the Reddit admins for *harassment* that also doesn't reference anything specific so I'm left to infer it's from the ONE modmail (in response to the ban) reiterating it's mod abuse.  \nThat is all my communication with them in **this** matter, because while some will be mentioned below, I was hoping to \"agree to disagree\".  \nBut neither I'm not going to hide my experience if this is how they treat me.  \n\n(Not important) When I was an OnAir Discussion host, I suggested a lot of things including making the template more accessible and was rudely shot down, they weren't happy I deviated ([post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/rkksjj)) compared with other posts (it's too wordy and every so often people will ask details like which stream platform and hosts/mods will complain no one is reading it) and will not try to discuss. Or specifically asking to post after the episode broadcast in KR or when it's subbed (nearly 2 days difference from the time they expect you to post and when the subbed version is released, 1.5 days diff for KR broadcast) and because the show is not that popular (community engagement) anyway I thought it could be helped with better visibly by timing the post. How did they respond? Again, very rudely to shut down, as if I said something personally offensive. This is all in Discord and I have since deleted anything that ties to my ID and left the server because I do not want to associate with them (which in hindsight I'm just seeing have coloured a lot of my language used in this thread) or is interested in being a host since, though sadly means I no longer have its hard evidence.  \nI don't consider myself as an active member of this community even if it may be 3? 4? years 90% of my Reddit profile but because I almost exclusively engage with OAD content, but neither am I some heathen who aims to dismantle the community simply to one up the mods.  \nSo this is not an isolated passive aggressive behaviour.\n\nMods seem to enjoy the power trip and hate anyone challenging them even if it's simply a different perspective. They **do not** attempt to meet you halfway and will actively try to demean your point of view and use all their privileges to enforce it. Aka, the /r mod power trip curse.  \nPlease be careful, everyone. And goodbye.",

                    "comment": "Hello there!\n\nI'm replying here since I believe there's a misunderstanding brewing here that we can easily solve, and I'll try being as precise as possible, addressing your concerns one by one.\n\n&gt; Mods gave me a warning\n\nThis is standard practice - we will warn users to step away when things get personal in order to prevent discussions from escalating and having to ban users for conduct.\n\n&gt; I ask for clarification not a novel (..) like I have so much time to spend reading it\n\nWe always felt it was better to explain clearly why something was removed and all the options a community member has, compared to not giving a clear way forward after a removal or warning.\n\n&gt; blatantly asking us to block each other\n\nIf two users start to argue, we'll ask them to move on. Blocking the other user is a quick option that makes it possible to avoid getting banned if you argue with the user again and not recognize their username is the same as the one you already got a warning for. We have explained previously that if you remain mindful of who you're interacting with and are mindful of conduct rules, as you have been since, no further action is needed.\n\n&gt; I was more pissed that I was messaged by the mods \n\nWe send messages to avoid cluttering the On-Air discussions, but I can understand that you might not like receiving messages.\n\n&gt; being chat restricted (..) me being individually blocked \n\nYou have not been chat restricted. Nor have you been individually blocked. Had any of those things happened, you would have gotten a message explained what happened, why it happened, for how long it'll last and what your next steps are. We have very strict moderating guidelines concerning user banning.\n\nWhat you are experiencing in the Crash Course in Romance On-Air threads is a Reddit feature called **Crowd Control** - see the [official documentation here](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038129231-Crowd-Control). Specifically, *Crowd Control for Posts* which filters some comments for mod review. This option is turned on when On-Airs show signs of getting out of control: bashing actors, arguing among multiple users, a large influx of new users on a thread who are very much not following the rules, multiple attempts to share illegal streaming sources, spam attempts etc.\n\n&gt; every other poster works fine\n\nMany other users are caught up in Crowd Control filters. You just can't see them until they're approved, the same way others can't see yours. Crowd control is not that sophisticated to be able to filter specific users, nor can we include/exclude users from it. Quite frankly, there's a chance I'd be filtered as well if I participated. It's a Reddit feature, but it's still quite new (read: buggy) and that might explain why you didn't come across it when googling.\n\n&gt; How it works? It appears perfectly fine in my end but everyone else it's hidden/deleted if you have the direct link. \n\nYes, that's exactly how Crowd Control works. Nothing is deleted or removed, just temporarily hidden.\n\n&gt; After a few hours, it appears normally, after being manually mod? approved.\n\nWe do try to clear everyone's comments as quickly as possible, but I do admit we've been stretched pretty thin these past few weeks. Please bear with us. \n\n(Also a sign it's not just you that's being caught up in filters, it takes a bit to get through all of them chronologically as an approval is a 0.5 second job, but removals take about a minute)\n\n&gt; It's not even from the mod I spoke to \n\nI'd just like to point out that if you send a modmail, it goes to a shared mod inbox, so we'll all see it, regardless of who ultimately addressed your concern.\n\n&gt; I can no longer enjoy this community the same way again\n\nI truly do hope you can enjoy it as you used to now that we've cleared the air on what's happening behind the scenes, so to say. \n\n&gt; Also chat restricted by automod. Nice.\n\nAutomod has a neat feature that it notices when someone needs our attention; it [looks like this for your comment](https://i.imgur.com/iiCDe4W.png). Otherwise your comment might have gotten buried in the Wrap-Up discussion and you'd never get an answer.\n\nIf you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask by replying here, or reach out to us via modmail if you'd like to have questions requiring more detailed answers.",

That's why it was annoying that I was messaged about it **not** because mods are doing their job but **failing** to see it's over and **I was reprimanded for it**.\n\nBeing told to block each other is an anti social solution. Maybe it works for kids, but this community has all sorts of ages and I would think the most frequently engaged ones are in the older brackets, like myself. No way you can convince me otherwise.\n\nIt would be helpful if there is a sticky mention this Crowd Control feature especially because it's a new feature and as you have said it affected so many people.\nThe especially rubbed me the wrong way is that it started with that misconduct (which I understand is the trigger) and I was also told it's a \"3rd party app\" problem initially which lowkey felt like gaslighting.  \nI get that this is all just a terrible miscommunication but it does not relieve the headache it took to reach here.

                                    "comment": "No problem, we're always here to help and/or clarify. I've just dug up the old modmails.\n\n&gt; My first modmail was asking for clarification \n\nI think [this is the modmail](https://i.imgur.com/GC5eAX8.png) that started the problem, if I understand correctly.\n\nThe problem here was that we all pretty much get a red light alert flashing whenever someone says \"unable to post further in kdrama\". That, to us, is a clear sign that they're either a) banned,  b) experiencing severe technical difficulties on the server side or c) experiencing difficulties using Reddit from their specific device. So we immediately do three things: \n\n1. Check the ban log to see if the user is banned ([looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/XNo5m5R.png) - as you can see you've never been banned)\n2. Check our mod queue to see if we have any posts stuck in there (you haven't had any posts nor comments stuck when we checked)\n3. Check the [Reddit status](https://www.redditstatus.com/) (everything seemed operational)\n\nSince the first three checks returned okay, we asked you to see if you can [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10m942d/comment/j6f3vhk/) to see if you can access r/KDRAMA. You managed to comment, we were a bit baffled as to why then you are experiencing difficulties posting and suggested alternative ways of resolving your problem - old/new reddit, switching networks from mobile to wired. \n\nYou can see clearly that we were helping resolve a connection problem (a very frequent thing in the past year or so, as sometimes the Reddit app is buggy, and the new Reddit interface doesn't play nice with some firewalls). From what we know, you being unable to post and being warned about conduct are two very much unrelated issues, that unfortunately happened close to each other.\n\n&gt; not because mods are doing their job but failing to see it's over \n\nI fully understand that it was very much over for you personally, but the thing is: *we respond to misconduct as soon as we see it.* In an ideal world, we'd be able to monitor all comments and posts in real time and prevent it from escalating. But we can't, not with this number of community members. So we respond when we can, in order to remind those who participated about our rules. \n\nAs I watched an episode of Midsomer Murders today, please try to understand this as an analogy: Andrew and Richard, both participants of the Midsomer 143rd annual apple cider contest, are arguing about the quality of their apple cider. In order to get back at Richard for the  slight of being told his apple cider smelled like a rotting turnip, Andrew sneaks into Richard's storage room and puts a dead rat into Richard's barrel of cider with the expected consequences. The judges who taste Richard's cider projectile-vomit the cider as soon as they taste it. The police arrive and review security tapes. It's clear Andrew put the rat into the barrel. What does the police do?\n\n1. Nothing, the rat was already in the barrel and it's not like there are any more barrels to put rats in. (it's already over)\n2. Tell Andrew not to do that ever again or they'll arrest him for food poisoning and tell Richard to de-escalate the situation in the future. (a warning should be given)\n\nI know it's a weird analogy, but I hope you can see why we make sure to give a warning every time. It helps everyone understand the rules - both the parties involved and any onlookers.\n\n&gt; Maybe it works for kids\n\nAdults also sometimes behave like kids - it is a viable solution for those people. We're very much happy you disengaged from that conversation, but blocking is also a solution for those who fear the other party will follow them and try to incite an argument again. It has happened before and blocking is a good way to prevent being harassed. Please note that if you (or anyone on r/KDRAMA) are being harassed there are ways to report it - if you let us know, we'll act immediately in r/KDRAMA and also make a report to the admins.\n\n&gt; Crowd Control\n\nOur subreddit is actively moderated - all of it with various levels of filters and crowd control - otherwise we'd be overrun with spam. That's why there's a notice right in the sidebar saying \"We are an actively moderated community. Please read The /r/KDRAMA Guide to familiarize yourself with how things operate, resources and more before posting.\" Crowd control is just a newer addition to the filters that are already deployed. Subreddits like r/modnews are responsible for informing everyone of changes in Reddit's tools and filters. if things start to get really out of control in one of the On-Airs, we sticky a notice explaining additional controls are being implemented. Same as with news articles that stir up controversy.\n\nIf you have any further questions or are wondering about any other aspects of our moderation approach, please send us a modmail\n\n&gt; it does not relieve the headache it took to reach here. I appreciate you trying though.\n\nI'm glad I could help a little, I hope you can finally relax doing what you love - be it [solving math problems](https://i.redd.it/r3ivnrhnpgg31.gif) or, what we usually recommend, watching a new episode of your favourite kdrama!",

Love the dynamic between the main couple, they\u2019re both badass. Almost all of the side characters are insufferable though lol. I began watching this drama because I wasn\u2019t in the mood for the last three episodes of **She Would Never Know** - the main couple is quite boring to me. Will finish this drama eventually.",

His entire approach to his character in this show seems to be screaming 90% of his lines. One of the things I love most about him now is the way he moves -- definitely a skill he has picked up since filming this.\n\nI'm not sure if I will b able to watch all of this one.

            "comment": "For those who don't know Thursdays and Fridays are known as *Dump Days*, that's when streamers like AppleTV+, Prime Video, Netflix etc post (dump) their content, the ones they think it will have high ratings. Usually Prime Video and AppleTV+ do it on Thursdays, Netflix dominates the Fridays, Disney+ on Wednesdays and it looks like Paramount+ is trying to do it on Tuesdays.\n\nWhy they do it on the weekdays? They get paid to let big movies on weekends and they also advertise for those movies on their platform since Netflix and Disney+ have ads. So the weekends are reserved for movies and that's why those platforms \"fight\" for the weekdays ratings. Another reason is that people usually go out on weekends with family and don't watch much online content. Yes, some of them do post other series/movies other days but they don't think the ratings will be high.\n\nIn Korea is different since weekend slots people are home with family and therefore they have higher viewership ratings on the weekend.\n\nAnyway, nothing is written in stone but I hope some of you understand why North American streamers don't follow korean releases. Viki does it and sometimes Disney+ and Netflix do it but again, not a rule. \n\nYes I know it's complicated but in the end is mostly the competition for viewers. I know a lot of people stay home on weekends and binge series but I think they realized they have a higher viewership when they release the episode the first time on a weekday.\n\nSince they are adding  **\"+\"** like Samsung +, Walmart +, MGM + I decided to join the trend. There is a Viki plus but that's different. Maybe soon we will have tvN +, SBS +, KBS +, MBC +....lol",

Those platforms will always give priority to their content first and whatever they think will be high ratings. Kdramas is not their priority unless in Asia or something that they see people are really interested in such as Snowdrop. Netflix gave up on it cause of the controversy but Disney saw the opportunity for ratings and took it which they were right. \n\nParamount+ is still on baby steps so it might be difficult to get their content. There are more kdramas they are producing but there was no release date and it might not be released worldwide. The following kdramas will be on their platform (I hope this year): **A Bloody Lucky Day** and **Queen Woo** will be available on Paramount+ in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, Latin America, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. [source](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/paramount-korean-content-a-bloody-lucky-day-and-queen-woo-1235392744/)\n\n- *A Bloody Lucky Day*:  is a thriller action series about an ordinary taxi driver Taek, who gets entangled with a customer that turns out to be a serial killer. The series is directed by Pil Gam-Sung (Hostage: Missing Celebrity) and written by Kim Min-sung and Song Hanna. It is produced by CJ ENM\u2019s production house Studio Dragon, The Great Show and Studio N, and stars Lee Sung-min (Reborn Rich) as Oh Taek, the taxi driver; Yoo Yeon-seok (Hospital Playlist) as Geum Hyuk-soo, the psychopathic killer; and Lee Jung-eun (Parasite, Yonder) as Hwang Soon-gyu, the relentless chaser.\n\n- *Queen Woo*: is a period drama series directed by Jung Se-kyo (Oh! My Gran) and written by Lee Byoung-hak (The Royal Tailor). It follows the story of Queen Woo Hee, the first woman in history to become queen twice, as she embarks on a journey to inherit the throne amidst a fierce battle between all the tribes owned by the late King\u2019s brothers. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to juggle between all these platforms but since kdramas are getting popular they need good ones to \u201cforce\u201d us to subscribe to them.\n\nI\u2019m also looking forward to seeing HBO\u2019s Korean drama (I thought it was gonna be a movie but people are saying it\u2019s a series so I\u2019m not sure now) **Beyond the Wardrobe**, I saw some videos online and I hope it\u2019s not just fluffy and full of tropes but maybe that\u2019s what we will get.

In almost every episode, intense fight scenes are depicted, but the portrayal of injured characters lacks realistic side effects or long-term consequences. In one of the earlier episodes, FL chokes the gangster character until he loses consciousness yet the potential neurological consequences are not depicted. Another episode, the ML repeatedly delivers multiple punches to the same gangster character\u2019s head but potential short-term consequence of the blows isn\u2019t exhibited in the character's brain. The absence of realistic side effects experienced by the beaten characters from the injuries sustained in the fight scenes, particularly in action and/or crime Kdramas, is deeply concerning. \n\nCould someone post a suggestion to the Korean TV channel and cable TV to consider a Kdrama with the main lead that strongly believe in pacifism? He or She resolves conflict with his/her silver tongue and unconventional methods, without using his/her fists or any violence means.",

I love how it's really a loose adaptation and a new take on a classic story. The first few episodes had me hooked. But by the end of episode 4, I was so frustrated with some of the characters that I had to stop. I may go back to it later, but I think I'm just not in the mood for characters who are poor communicators and/or who behave recklessly, especially the middle sister in this one. (I think female characters often get a lot of unnecessary hate, but in this case, I think she's truly quite insufferable. &gt;!She humiliated her younger sister and tried to embarrass her older sister in front of a \"date\" as well. She was also the first one to reject \"stolen\" money, which I found quite self-righteous given she's the only sister who has had any exposure to real wealth growing up living with the Great Aunt. Now, understandably that came with strings, but she lacks all self-awareness about it. She spends half her time with a rich childhood friend while she's suspended from her job, criticizing decisions her oldest sister is making for survival, and not taking any compassionate approach to the position her younger sister is in with her own rich friend.)!&lt;\n\n**1% of Something (9/16):** I started this in the past but dropped it because I wasn't in the mood (this is really a theme with me), but I'm going through it pretty quickly this time around. I'm very torn on this show. I love the premise - I'm a sucker for contract marriage tropes - and I think the leads have great chemistry. But the longer the show goes on, the more put off I am by the ML's alpha male possessive traits towards FL that in any other circumstance I'd call a major red flag. He is constantly grabbing her wrist (this is in so many kdramas it doesn't always bother me, but he really yanks her), pushing her up against things like his car, and otherwise being kind of rough with her physically. He also tries to control how she dresses and any men she is in contact with &gt;!(yet he finds it amusing when Da Hyun gets jealous of his horrible ex! I'm glad this was called out on screen as unfair)!&lt;, even to the point of destroying items &gt;!(Ji Su's poster)!&lt; in her room. I kept hoping he would change his behavior for the better, but I see no improvement. I think I'll end up watching the whole thing but resenting Jae In the whole time unless he has a total personality transplant.",

Doesn\u2019t matter how good the reviews are. If you\u2019re not feeling like a thriller, probably don\u2019t force it at that time. It makes getting through the drama so much more difficult (if you can get into it at all). \n\nHappy watching!",

            "comment": "I finished **Mr. Sunshine** over the weekend and feel a bit wrung out. That drama really stays with you.\n\nAfter finishing **Mr. Sunshine,** I finished the jDorama **Why Didn't I Tell You A Million Times?** I didn't like the first episode, but persevered and liked most of the middle, but the ending was a hot mess. The writing was just sloppy. I love Takeru Satoh, though.\n\nI've watched 7 of 16 episodes of **Moment at Eighteen**, and I'm really liking this drama! It's kind of like a mix between **Sky Castle** (for its depiction of parents working hard to get their kids into prestigious universities), **Reply 1998\\*\\*** (in its depiction of youth), and a quiet drama like **Do You Like Brahms?** or maybe a bit of **I'll Go to You When the Weather is Fine** (in its quiet vibe, also in the depiction of an introvert with emotional wounds). I'll post a review when finished.\n\nETA: \\*\\* I realized after writing this that I've inadvertently combined **Reply 1988** and **Reply 1997.** I decided this was a Freudian slip. There are some plot points that have something in common with **Reply 1997**, but the main male lead reminds me more of Park Bo Gum's Choi Taek than of  Seo In Guk's Yoon Yoo-Je.",

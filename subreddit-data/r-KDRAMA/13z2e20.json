Episode 9, I totally replayed the scene when Yeon and Rang were wrestling because the shades of blue they both were wearing were flattering, fantastic and looked like good quality material. \ud83e\udd2d \n\nThe cut and thicker fabric of women's clothing make it easy to look frumpy, so all the ladies must be quite slim in real life to pull off the era. The only thing I dislike is Eun Ho's wig!! Hong Joo slays ALL LOOKS!\n\nYeo Hee's love of sparkly stage outfits now makes sense considering her conversation with Rang. I gotta say, she fell first but Rang fell harder. Ready to die for love already \ud83e\udd72. That guy is totally \"go big or go home\" type \ud83d\ude05...must be a family trait. \n\nI loved the 1930s hotel set up. Great style, including shoes (Rang shoes \ud83d\udc4c), but terrible era to time travel to regardless of where you are globally tho \ud83e\udd14.",

If Lee Yeon is a variable that won't change the future, what's the point of supporting him to fight against the Japanese demons when things are expected to unfold as they will anyway?",

She should know by now that Yeon is damn ruthless; That's been his character from the beginning\n2. The convo with MY in the forest when Yeon says he always goes by the book makes no sense to me? He even said in ep 1 that he doesn't tend to follow the rules? He literally never follows the rules wtf. But that scene where they admitted how much they looked up to each other was sweet I must admit. But it bugs me that Yeon is so chummy &amp; nonchalent about the guy who literally stabbed his fucking brother. Wtf is this about\n3. Rang &amp; Yeon's solo scenes are always a scene stealer bc of how charismatic these 2 actors are. I could watch an entire series with no plot for them alone. For the first time in this damn show they at least imply that Rang is &gt;!more than a damsel in distress &amp; ascertain he can hold his own!&lt; which I liked\n4. Rang &amp; Yeon Hee's scene at the beach was so very sweet but making me deeply paranoid that she will most definitely not survive this season and Rang will be left once again &gt;!without any family!&lt;\n5. I have no respect for Hong Joo nor Moo Young and at this point I'm totally fine if &gt;!either or both of them die!&lt;. Their friendship is just weird to me at this point\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just saw the preview for next week's episode and I guess what we all dreaded/anticipated came true; &gt;!Jesus I wish Rang could catch a fucking break for once;!&lt;",

Did I miss something that made it unable for her to scream?\n\nRang's helplessness that was expressed in his internal thoughts really cemented to me how S2's Rang is younger and more innocent than S1's Rang, who had a much sharper and cruel edge to him and also never reconnected with Yeon. Both brothers though are ruthless, don't get me wrong lol. That fox motto about repaying a debt, whether it's cruelty or kindness, is no joke. Rang had so many scenes this season that put him in the middle of rather high stakes tension! For fellow Lee Rang fans, it's been an emotional rollercoaster ride!! That's not done \ud83d\ude2d!!\n\nLike another reddit user said, I really liked the scene between Eun Ho and the Bok Hye Ja. It was so beautiful and also... human \ud83e\udd14. If you think about it, the non-humans have lived through many difficult periods and this is just one of them. But I thought about this and realized that even in my own family, I'm the first generation that has not experienced war, famine, and displacement. I don't know, I just thought how that moment was so beautiful and how Eun Ho's anger, helplessness, and resilience ground us in the human experience of the time period. The non humans may be stuck in portraits and survive poison darts, but human life is so much more fragile. \n\nLee Dong Wook did a great job of changing his posture after the body swap. Kim Bum stays demonstrating excellent emotional range. Woo Hyun Jin managed to look so pretty and frail in this episode. All my sidekicks continue to be such good boys! \ud83e\udd23",

We also see her let out a tiny squeak at the beginning of Episode 10, and then reach up and hold her throat. I could be wrong, but it just sounds like she's damaged her throat. (Which is convenient, but doesn't make much sense considering she's a super-power non-human. Singing extra shouldn't suddenly keep her from screaming, you'd think she could still do it but end up injuring her throat more or something.)",

This is the logic of a former mountain god?? He's so twisted and underhanded that I'm not surprised he's related to that brother of his. This is why he's not ML in Hong Joo's heart. \n\nSo Rang tells Yeo Hee to stay out of the fight. Then the Water Snail Bride tells Yeo Hee to lie low and not run around recklessly. What does she do?\ud83d\ude12 Please writers let her do something amazing to redeem this lapse in common sense and good judgement. To be clear, I get it, it's lurve. But not all of us lose brain cells in love \ud83d\ude24. Seriously, the writers, they're testing the audience, right? They're making sure we fight one another, right? Some comments be fatalistic like \"she's dying cause they won't give us a good ending\" while others are hopeful like #TeamJusticeForRang.

We know that it is explicitly stated the last time the golden ruler was seen was during 1938, Ryuhei needed someone powerful WITH a will and a reasoning to go against old lady (the person standing in the way of time traveling) Ryuhei definitely needs the golden treasures to take a strong hold over korea and create a different timeline where Japan kept their control. It seems he\u2019s using his brother (prolly always has) to fuel his motivations, I don\u2019t believe there was anyone else powerful enough in 2021 who would go against Taluipa in the way MY did",

            "comment": "I've thought Mooyoung was a &gt;!baekho!&lt; ever since seeing the intro sequence, but I'm glad his brother basically confirmed it with the whole &gt;!tiger family!&lt; thing (and Hongjoo calling him &gt;!tiger!&lt; too).\n\nI think Mooyoung works best as a character when he's got other characters to work off of - he was great fun in the episodes with Yeon and Hongjoo, and even when he was with Eunho/Yuri he was fun. The scene with Hyunuiong was great too bcs it showed how much he wants to just go back to being a kid, being taken care of, but he simply feels like he can't do that. They just keep him alone so often, and keep his reasons to himself, that his actions make zero sense to us and we have no real reason to connect to him bcs he can't really get any character development if he's constantly on his own. We can see with the others that despite him acting the villain he cares deeply (perhaps too deeply, considering he's doing this for his brother), and has a bit of a complex, most likely due to how weak he was compared to the other two while growing up. He's got the basis for a really great character, and I honestly don't even think it's the actor's fault - all of this and more shines through when he has another person to work with, he just rarely is paired up with anyone, or the writers keep going \"he must be MYSTERIOUS so NO EMOTION\". When he's allowed to play around with the character's emotions, he gains a lot more depth and likeability. The reason Rang\u2019s character in Season 1 worked so well and had us all becoming attached was bcs even tho he did this atrocities, we knew WHY he was doing them. We don\u2019t know why Mooyoung (or Hongjoo, really) are doing half of the things they\u2019re doing. And that seems to be an issue with this season - we\u2019re rarely told what Yeon is doing either until he himself explains it, but we trust him bcs we know him as a character. We don\u2019t know Mooyoung or Hongjoo and have no connection to them or reason to trust them, so the secrecy to the viewers isn\u2019t helping them as characters.\n\nThoughts on that aside, I really enjoy seeing the brother's relationship developing more, and really do not care about Rang and Yeohee's storyline yet... I love Yeohee as a character, but damn is he moving fast LMAO ~~perhaps I just never care about the romantic storylines as much as the platonic ones~~ Yeohee is so adorable, I kind of wish we got to see her more with people other than Rang or Bok Hyeja.. she's being reduced simply to \"Rang's loveline\", which I get is what most people want since Rang is so popular, but. I wanna see more her on her own too haha\n\nI think I'm in the huge minority here tbh - Rang having a \"tragic\" arc in the first season didn't bother me at all, despite him being my favorite character, bcs tragedies happen in real life and they're rarely shown in dramas bcs people react... exactly the way we have this time lol. It'd feel kind of redundant to give him yet another tragic arc, but the first season had the whole bittersweet ending, so... who knows. I'll be okay with him getting a happy ending or him having yet another tragedy, tbh. So long as we get more of him, I'm good lol\n\nThen again, I'm also in the minority for not blaming Yeon for how Rang was treated - we've extensively seen Rang's side of the story, but ironically, not much of Yeon's. People seem to give him grief a lot for how long he mourned Aheum, but for someone who is essentially immortal, mourning for a century or so would be akin to mourning the death of a loved one for about a year. And also, Rang IS literally a murderer in canon time. Like. Mass murderer. I love him to death and will defend him to the ends of the earth but he is also not a good dude lol. Idk. It just feels like Yeon gets a lot of flack simply bcs his relationship with Rang is complicated, and Rang is the fan favorite (with good reason, he's my favorite as well lol) and therefore people target him.\n\nAbsolutely love seeing side characters getting to do their own thing - I adore Jaeyoo to pieces and the girls acting like &gt;!they were a part of the mob!&lt; was so good.\n\nEDITED just to say - Hongjoo and Yeohee consistently have the prettiest and most dramatic outfits and I am in LOVE with them. The styling on the men is good too, ofc, but it's not as flashy and just. Wow. These stylists are out-doing themselves for sure",

I love seeing my favorite actors and characters deal with grief and pain, because it makes them more human and gives us more chances to connect with them - and that level of pain always brings out what they're truly like.\n\nSeeing Mooyoung in pain has been the highlight of his character arc for me, second only to when he gets teary-eyed when confronting someone from his past, like when he was with Hyunuiong. I don't think I'm a sadist or anything, but man. Give me the pathetic characters(Rang..) and I will love them dearly LMAO\n\n&gt;Rang deserved his end in S1 lol. In S2, for the younger Rang, I'd love to imagine being with Yeo Hee can stymie much of the angst that becomes violence.\n\nGod, you're the first person who has agreed with me in that his ending was deserved! Yes, he was the fan favorite \\[and MY favorite....\\] but he absolutely deserved the ending he got and I thought it was a beautiful send-off. Plus, it was done in such a way that you can so easily headcanon any number of ways he could be reincarnated and brought back without changing what happened in the drama itself.",

She definitely seems to be harsher on her (?? sending her to hell for killing one human vs. looking the other way for Rang, Yeon, etc?? ouch)\n\nUnleashing the yacha may simply get him sent to hell for a prolonged period of time, like Hongjoo was for killing a \\[despicable\\] human. It's sort of a gray line here because Rang has killed HUNDREDS of humans, decimated entire villages, etc and she sort of looks the other way bcs she likes Yeon and Yeon loves Rang (she gave her \"he's done bad things\" speech at the beginning of this season when Yeon wanted him reincarnated and caved pretty much immediately lmao). Mooyoung's done enough bad things though that I can see them go either way with it tbh - theoretically, most of the bad things he's doing are taking place in the past, in an alternate\\[?\\] timeline, so. He can kind of get away with a lot of it if he just goes back to current time LOL.\n\nI think he's got to die (for the storyline), but not by Taluipa. I genuinely don't think she can kill any of her \"kids\" - she imprisoned him in stone, after all, and didn't kill him in the first place.\n\nI would love to see him somehow managing to live peacefully in current time alongside Yeon and Rang (and... Hongjoo?? If she exists??? LOL) bcs he looks so genuinely happy when he's with them. He tries to act the villain and it bothers him but his home is still with them, and he knows it and hates it. Still! If he dies, absolutely no worries for me, I will be fleshing out his character more and then creating headcanons as to why he is reincarnated, just like I did for Rang before S2 was a thing \ud83d\ude02 Nothing will keep me from loving the pathetic men in this show",

It's the same reason I don't really fault the gisaengs for wanting to &gt;!stab Yeohee!&lt; - I mean, we obviously know Rang would come back for her regardless, but if you're a bunch of humans with the threat of something super-powerful that specifically wants to eat you, and there's a ton of them outside and now possibly one inside (with the black veins already beginning to appear), I can see why they're terrified and honestly, more power to that specific gisaeng for having the courage to go through with it.\n\nBut your point of view is totally valid - I think I look more into the characters than even the writer's intended, and I help them fill plot-holes and character flaws bcs I care about the characters so much that I want them to be more fleshed out than they are and do some of the character-building for them \ud83d\ude02",

Also, they are complementary to one another and draw strength from one another's love. I'm also not a big fan of the destined lovers or multiple lifetimes types pining love...mainly because I don't feel either Yeon or Ji Ah became better people because of their love for one another....in fact Yeon became worse. \n\nI felt Ji Ah was great as a person and PD but unsuitable for fighting the non-human powers that were wreaking havoc in S1. I always thought Rang was correct when he said that humans should just run and hide if they were ever facing the Imoogi lol. That's what I would do! It just made no sense to me that Ji Ah didn't seem scared at all. I think if I got to see more fear and vulnerability from both her and Yeon (which we actually saw from Rang and Yeo Hee!!) about the situation, it might've tugged at my heartstrings more. Like, I watch S1 3 times haha, and they still didn't work for me. Now, I just don't wanna hate them hahaa. I mean I don't wanna hate FLs. Ji Ah was too complex. As for Yeo Hee, they've made her sweet enough and the character setting/personality is refreshingly simple and oddly...human lol girlish human. \n\nClearly, I have some complicated feelings lmao. But ultimately, I like S2 better because the larger themes aren't focused on romantic love, which is just one plotline...that's ultimately about healing anyway.",

She did stupid things but she was proactive and had a reason to do those stupid things, as misguided as they were. She had an unwavering set of beliefs despite how her entire world told her she was crazy for believing them, and had a surprisingly tiny support system and still managed to make it through all the bullshit that was thrown her way. I didn\u2019t care about the romance at all but I genuinely like Yeon and Jiah both as characters and feel like people don\u2019t give them the credit or thought they deserve - they\u2019re flawed and they make stupid choices and it\u2019s incredibly human of them \ud83d\udc9d\nThat aside, Rang didn\u2019t exit for the ship - that\u2019s what the writer\u2019s intended ofc, but he as a character was not doing it to make Jiah happy. He was doing it bcs he loved his brother and wanted his brother alive - it had nothing to do with the romance his brother had with Jiah, and I think Rang would probably have been completely happy to sacrifice Jiah instead of himself if it was an option lol. It made complete sense from his point of view, the little brother who flinches towards violence but can\u2019t bring himself to seriously harm the one person he claims to hate, and a good look at how despite what he preaches he would give anything to protect the people he loves (a good parallel to Yeon, actually, who does the same but is seen as a villain for doing so by the audience lol).\nEDIT: holy shit that\u2019s long, I apologize!! I have literally never talked about this drama with anyone else before (first time using this Reddit as well) and I clearly jumped at the chance to be able to discuss it!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05I\u2019m so sorry!",

They are funny when they are not trying to kill each other.\nEun hos  10 mins screentime, for a change.\nRang's romance, obviously.\nJust how every female character wants Yeon.\n\nWhy do u get the feeling that this season will end in a cliffhanger?",

Not saying the episode was boring but pretty much nothing happened in episode 10. Come to think of it, all that happened in this episode was that the mercenaries were introduced and we realize Yeo-Hee might&gt;! survive!&lt; \\- the rest was all fighting and bickering. \n\nSo Yachas are basically Korean for zombies? Good to know. Korean zombie movie/shows never cease to amaze me. Featuring those creatures gave a major apocalyptic survival vibes and I love it.\n\nI was thinking that the Hypno Kid was too cute to be a villain, but the preview for the next ep convinced me that he's a handsome villain. Can't wait to see this guy and his powers.\n\nA lot of people hate MY but I do not. From his POV he witnessed his best friend killing his dear brother, whom he loved more than his own life. It's understandable why he's obsessed with revenge. No, he's not my top fav character but I def do not hate him.\n\nONLY 2 MORE EPISODES!! Wondering how the story is going to play out. We still have MY's hyung's mystery to solve, the mercenaries boss is here, Kato still the bad guy, LY has to go back and we still have actual Lee Rang to revive/reincarnate (yall forgot? this all started coz LY wanted to bring back LR)\n\nAlso, I miss Ji-Ah...and Blackie, the kid obviously, not the dog.\n\nP.S. Is no one going to talk about TOTNT theme song? I can't get it out of my head and have been humming it all day long!",

It is not trying to pander to the foreign audience and is unapologetically itself leaving us to do the homework on the folk culture of the country. I love that! I want more shows like this!\n\nThe drama is unfolding in such an exciting way. I am heavily invested.

It was just a set up for ep 10 and final episodes.\n\nI hope they just didn't add that hypnosism plot for comic relief (although it was not funny) but actually will have importance to the story, because it seems far fetched the creatures got hypnotized.\n\nThe 3 mountain gods relationship has kinda weird in refreshing way- I will kill you to get what i want, but am still friends with you. But i have long stopped emphathising with them. I somehow liked (for those who have seen season1 ) the FML and her two friends from the show friendship more than these gods.\n\n MY's storyline seems very predictable. At this point I can see, his brother seems very sus and will unleash some chaos, MY will either kill his brother or die trying. I actually liked the actor in itewon class, somehow his character just doesn't have umph factor. I guess the writers were trying to get us to root for him, like rang with season1 but i would've preferred if he was outright villainous.\n\nAlso eun ho doesn't have much to do. The actress did so well in season 1, but here there is nothing. I want ki yu ri back.\n\nI think the second half of the season is suffering, with a lot of storyline threads, and a lot of characters but not enough time. The first half was very strong.\n\nThere are 3 episodes left. I hope it is a banger. And seriously don't kill the mermaid.",

And if Gumihos can only love once, whats up with their father going at it with multiple women??\n\n\n&gt;!What if their father is in disguise as that Hypnotist's assistant? Its obvious he has a bigger role then we're initially led to believe - if not their father, then he's probably the Japanese Shinigami's Big Boss?!&lt;",

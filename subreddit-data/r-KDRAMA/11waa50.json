The one that stands head and shoulders above the rest for me is from the first episode of **Start-Up**. \n\nIt\u2019s a scene from Dal-mi\u2019s childhood, and takes place on the street where she lives. The street is lined on both sides with vividly pink blossoms, and the blossom petals are shown falling in a gentle, slow-motion cascade against the backdrop of a pristine blue sky. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the single most beautiful scenes I\u2019ve witnessed in a drama.",

            "comment": "I just finished **Crash Course in Romance**, and overall, I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI love seeing Jeon Do-yeon, my favorite actress, but sometimes she's the only good thing about a project that she appears in, but fortunately that wasn't the case here.\n\nJung Kyung-ho was good too, and I thought they made a great couple. I mostly think of him in older dramas (like **Smile You**, **Cruel City**, and **Prison Playbook**), so it was nice seeing him in something more recent.\n\nI also loved Roh Yoon-seo. I've only seen her once before, in **Our Blues**, where she was equally good. I haven't yet seen **20th Century Girl**. But clearly, she has enough talent to be a lead actress and has a long and promising career ahead of her.\n\nIn addition to the cute romance, the story tackled the important topic of the high-pressure competitive education system in Korea and the tendency of parents to seek social status through their children's accomplishments.\n\nI thought the early episodes were very well-crafted, but the second half of the series got a little sloppy and failed to tie up all the loose ends. For example &gt;!Su-ah and Seon-jae's mom both suddenly changed their personalities, but we never got a satisfactory scene showing how or why they changed, so those character arcs felt unearned. Another missing scene is the one where Hae-ee should have explained how she was just bluffing about moving to Japan so she could force her mom to abandon her again and leave their family alone, and apologizing for giving her aunt and uncle so much heartache. Also, I didn't appreciate the red herring of making Hee-jae seem to be the steel ball killer. I thought it would have been classier to make that more ambiguous in the early episodes. Also, when it turned out that the celebrity tutor's right-hand man was a serial killer who was murdering anyone who stood in the way of his boss, this was the one thing that strangely didn't turn into a big scandal with the public or hurt Choi's career. That seems odd to me because being so closely associated with a serial killer, even though that wasn't Choi's fault, seems way more scandalous and lurid than the things the gossips were having a heart attack about, like private tutoring on the side, having an affair with a student's mom, etc. Those things are absolutely nothing compared to your best friend and sidekick being a serial killer.!&lt;\n\nBut the pleasant, comfortable slice of life moments and the excellent acting and likeable characters made up for all those flaws.",

So I was browsing through Amazon Prime for something western to watch and nothing looked good.  Lo and behold, Amazon has put in an asian drama recommendation section for me. I told myself I can watch an asian drama as long as its a thriller or something with no romance and no swoony guys in it so I was looking through the thumbnails and saw what looked like a cool supernatural thriller.  I pop it on without much thought and see pretty girl, cool ... old priest, cool ... kickass fight scene, cool ... then 10 minutes into it Cha Eunwoo pops up as a hot Italian priest?  I got so mad I just shut the tv off and went for a run.",

He's probably the most handsome face I've ever seen in my life, srsly his beauty is out of this world..\n\nps: I somehow thought Soo Hyuk's a woman in a cosplay when I first watched the trailer, sorryyy.. but later I saw him in \"Tomorrow\" and absoluty loved him in this drama, he has such a deep mesmerizing voice I didn't know how I assumed he was a woman at that time lmao..",

So on that premise would it be right to assume that he saved them? \nPlus Jisoo was looking up the stairs at someone and his eyes looked hopefull.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I think he would because he cared for them and he probably realised that Jisoo was going to tell him all about the situation before the bell rang!&lt;\n\nI need help",

It's like Gilmore Girls with the whole town being characters and involved in the storyline, which is my favorite part about it. I also typically hate a love triangle but found this one manageable because I wasn't worried about her not picking the correct character. Tried watching Start-Up afterwards but found myself rooting for the wrong dude apparently and was disappointed in the outcome. Anyone have recommended shows similar to Hometown Cha Cha Cha with some humor, a really cute love story, great character development, and possibly without a love triangle? I also enjoyed Business Proposal quite a lot of that helps!",

It's a hot button issue around here.\n\nOn Netflix, I think you would like Touch Your Heart, Love to Hate You, Because This is My First Life, and Our Beloved Summer. Also Crash Course in Romance (just ended) if you're ok with a small side helping of serial killer.",

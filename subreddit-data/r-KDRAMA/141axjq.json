But we're shown Yoon Yong doing that, and it's easy because it's in the loungeroom. This way, also, he can be shown caring for her in various ways - as per the usual blankets, etc.",

His father must've &gt;!killed his mother too!&lt; and fled to the US to avoid the truth coming out. So in 1987 he returned to Korea earlier than he said he would and then went back to the airport to pretend otherwise. And he killed his son in 2022 because Hae Joon somehow uncovered the truth.",

Is Soon Ae's novel the reason he targetted her? Or does he hate protesters and think reading causes women to become protesters and hence 'dangerous'?\n\nThere's also the fact that Hae Kyung died in the original timeline. Mi Sook wrote about murders &gt;!she witnessed!&lt; in her novel... so did &gt;!she witness!&lt; the third murder in the original timeline or did she make that part up? Did the &gt;!army guy!&lt; kill Hae Kyung? Will he let her be in this timeline since she's not a threat to &gt;!his relationship with her mother anymore?!&lt; Or will he kill her because she finds out about him? Is that why he originally killed her?\n\nI'd prefer this outcome over the other two suspects you mentioned because I dislike the idea of &gt;!filicide and sororicide.!&lt;",

I don\u2019t know how to insert spoiler tags, so I will try to write my thoughts without giving away too much: the one who no longer exists in the dream/future is closely related to the killer and thus will not be born in the future. By stopping the killer, the person will stop himself/herself from coming into this world. We know that the culprit is a man and a powerful man (Misook implying that he won\u2019t get caught). Perhaps he\u2019s powerful because his father is? Why did his girlfriend leave him so suddenly as soon as their son was born? Because she found out that he was a horrible person and thought that the son will become like his father. I hope I\u2019m wrong. All that sweet-future talk between HJ and YY just screams that we ain\u2019t getting a happy future for them. \ud83d\ude1e",

And I must applaud this drama for the perfect casting cause both parents of the leads have so much chemistry together and actually have some resemblance to their children from the future.\n\nEp 12 was a perfect mix of everything imo. I love how everything escalated so quickly at the end. Not sure why, but I saw some people hating the romance between the leads. But I love them and their confessions are one of the best ones I've seen in Kdrama. They don't really give me the heart-fluttering romance, but they do deliver the comfort kind. They feel quite natural actually.\n\nFor the thriller aspect, I honestly cannot guess who's the real culprit. I don't think it's Haejun's father but it would make sense if you consider Yoonyoung's dream where Haejun doesn't exist (cause his father got caught). But I'm still hoping it won't be him, for Haejun's sake and cause I really like his character.",

Maybe if he has no choice but to tell Dongshik the truth, Dongshik might help them catch the killer?  \n\nIm also suspecting &gt;! Haejoon\u2019s dad and the other military? teacher !&lt; rn because we ran out of any &gt;! male student suspects and it looks like its going to be a male adult. !&lt; &gt;!Haejoon\u2019s dad!&lt; is looking the most suspicious rn but there is a chance he might be the person  who made the time traveling car. But if he did make the car, maybe he time traveled to catch the culprit just like Haejoon rather than being the killer ? Maybe when he went back to the present, &gt;!Haejoon!&lt; took the car so his future self wasnt able to time travel again? That\u2019s why Haejoon and Yoonyoung are the only people from the future in 1987 \ud83e\udd14 I dont even know what im saying atp \ud83d\ude2d give me the car so I can time travel to the finale date pls",

            "comment": "Just gonna throw it out there....I think the killer/culprit is someone that hasn't appeared in the series yet. \n\nBased on everything that happened this ep, most of us viewers have come to the conclusion that the person doing the killings has to be a man. Whether or not someone is manipulating them (ex. ko minsook) is undetermined, but based on the ep, it seems unlikely that she is behind it. I also don't understand the theories behind Ko Minsook's mother being involved, she's a bad mother, but I don't think she's the killer?\n\nSo that leaves us with these options: \n\n- Baek Hee Sub (was at home, alibi is a little sus, but he is unlikely to have been in both places at once)\n\n- Bum Ryong (died, I rly thought he would be the unexpected culprit, but he just had bad luck)\n\n- Ko Minsoo (was in jail, could've committed the first 2 murders but unlikely that we will come back to him as a suspect)\n\n- Baek Yu Sub (theory pretty much got debunked earlier, and I don't see him playing a major role in the series here on out)\n\n- Army Guy (unlike popular theories, it just doesn't fit that it's him. why would a girls' teacher leave that note?)\n\n- Baek Dong Sik (personally found the detective to be very sus but given his morals and intent to find the culprit, couldn't have been him)\n\n- Soon Ae's brother (we literally know nothing about him???) \n\n- Haejun's dad (we don't know much about him but I find it highly unlikely that his very absent dad who did research came back in 2021 to murder Haejun)\n\n- Haejun's grandpa (no, just no. he cares too much about the kids)\n\n- Haejun (was arrested in this ep and obvs as his present self could not have killed them. however, we don't know exactly how the time travel works in this series so there's a slim possibility he somehow is tied to it. very unlikely tho)\n\n\nSo after reviewing every current male character in the series, the only viable suspects are haejun's dad or haejun himself in a time related fiasco. Both are highly unlikely so I theorize that the culprit is someone we don't know\n\n....or there's also the possibility that they'll screw up the ending like so many other dramas and make the culprit one of the random characters. I hope it's not that anticlimactic though...",

Ko Minsoo in the future saw the female lead and that was a really interesting scene. \nI have my doubts with Baek Yu Sub, we don\u2019t really know him and what he was doing that night when Soonae was kidnapped. Also the first two victims were close to him, they were with him the night both of them died, I think that\u2019s really strange. Maybe he is being blackmailed by someone or he has a motive? \nAlso Bum Ryong death is so similar to ML death, the position of the body, the shoes, almost everything, maybe Haeju is not going to die? Like he save himself but that change in the future made a effect in the past an BumRyong died instead of him? The scene was comparing the bodies. \nAnd for sure neither Minsook\u2019s mom and Haeju\u2019s grandpa are the killer/culprit",

            "comment": "Episode 12. Here's a wild guess and you heard it here first: **The killer is Mi Sook.** When she said the killer will not be caught, the **killer is Mi Sook from the future**. Herself. From the future. That's why she said the killer will not be caught.  After all, how can anyone catch someone who doesn't live in their timeline?!\n\nMi Sook doesn't let the bully girl see the killer in the fields, because it's her -- the future Mi Sook. And she doesn't even look scared to look at the killing while they are hiding, because she is watching herself. But she wants to make sure bully girl didn't see the killing, so she asks her (as misdirection):\n\nMi Sook: Did you see \"**their**\" face (not even saying her or him)? The normal observation would be to use him or her, if it's one person. She repeats the line, saying you didn't see \"**them\"** to the bully girl, as if she wants bully girl to say it. Because bully girl is somehow smitten with Mi Sook, she echoes what Mi Sook, **\"Did you see them?\"** The repeated use of \"them\" is unusual here, as Mi Sook is a writer and would know incorrect pronouns.\n\nWe don't even know if Mi Sook's wounds were actually done by her brother, or it's self-inflicted, meaning she did it herself to frame his brother who is not that smart to hatch dastardly acts; he's the village idiot, so it's not him, but he's the perfect scapegoat for Mi Sook.\n\nIt's Mi Sook because when she was exposed for lying about the book, she exacted revenge and chose her next victim, the original author Soon Ae, for shaming her into stealing her book. (Soon Ae would not have been a victim in the original story, as she successfully stole her book. But in this alternate reality, Soon Ae got her book back.) Mi Sook could no longer accept losing to Soon Ae, thus making her a victim. In the early episodes, she envied Soon Ae.\n\nIf we go by screenwriting 101, the clues are usually put in the beginning, the middle is all misdirection, and it wraps itself back to the beginning, when we all suspected it was Mi Sook.\n\nAs for the matchbox message, \"**A woman who reads is dangerous**.\" That's from Mi Sook. She's talking about herself being dangerous.  *(If it's not her, then the drama lost an opportunity to make sense. But if it's really her, we're watching a great thriller.)*",

Because he was the one who made the time machine in the first place.\n\nYoon Young changed the past (1987) so much, so definitely she changed the future too.\n\nBut when she goes back to the future (2021), I hope that her mom and dad will be still her parents who are better versions of themselves and the parent-child relationship will be better... just like Back to the Future ending.\n\nI'm sure what Hae-joon's grandfather said about his mom wasn't true.",

Because the feeling I got on first watch and during re-watch, he wasn't aware it was his dad's creation (hence the mention of the manual book and being too curious to try it out).\n\nAnd how long ML's dad stay in US? Because he has to come back to Korea at some point to create that time machine and try it out to see if it works, right? So he is one possible person that could go back in time to do the killings. And maybe that's why MiSook said the culprit will never get caught, maybe she saw the car vanishing too.\n\nWho is Go Mi Sook's husband shown on ep1? Is he someone from 1987 village that hasn't been introduced yet? And on ep1 shows MiSook came back home with dirty pants from the village, what did she just do?\n\nMan, I really hope the writers will give us a satisfying ending (please don't pull a Reborn Rich again).",

That's like my biggest pet peeve trope. Why can't we just hate them based off their shit actions?\n\nSo the killer is wearing white shoes. They zoomed in on them a couple of times. I know one of ya'll been paying super attention. Legit just throwing shit at the wall, but what if it's ML granddad? I know the killer was running a lot and getting a little acrobatic, but Ko Mi Sook said the killer wouldn't get caught. Sounds like it's someone powerful. Grandpa is leader of the town and runs shit heavily. We also saw in a previous episode he was running a marathon. Idk I'm out of ideas \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: added words",

He did the noblest thing, in the end.!&lt;\n* &gt;!I knew Hae Joon was going to get arrested at some point in this story; I didn't expect it to be for this reason, but it was coming. He's so involved in all the happenings, and that's too suspicious for the people living then, since nobody has any idea what's going on.!&lt;\n* &gt;!I so liked the scene with Yoon Yong and Hae Joon at the riverside in 12 - \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude0a. So sweet. The way she expressed it, and the way he responded - both so humbly and sincerely and simply.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Is the murderer from the town? Does Mi Sook know him? Is that why she said he won't get caught - because he's in a position of power, or something else? Or is it because he's a crazy madman who lives in the woods?!&lt;\n* &gt;!Hae Joon noticing that Bum Ryong is in exactly the same position as he was in the future, on the ice. Implications: is it in retaliation for stopping the killer from killing Soon Ae by chasing him, or because Hae Joon, then, also has saved someone else, the way Bum Ryong saves Soon Ae? Because otherwise, the victims are all women, aren't they? The only men are because those men stop him/get in his way. I wonder, if that's the case, who Hae Joon is saving in the future?

However, we did see a guy running away from the scene who didn\u2019t look familiar. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring in an unknown at this point. Hope this back and forth isn\u2019t just a filler but is giving us real clues to the killer. \n\nWhy was the car door open when it first arrived? Did someone get out?",

And then the appearance of the guy looks like the &gt;!Army guy!&lt; but I don't think its him because its clearly not him from the past episodes. As for the &gt;!homeroom teacher !&lt;my gut tells me he is the killer.  As for the possibility that the killer also time travelled it will make the storyline more complicated and very unlikely.",

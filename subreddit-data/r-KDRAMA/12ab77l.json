Strangers From Hell:  I absolutely love this show, it's incredible, I think it permanently rewired the chemistry in my brain and turned me into the world's biggest simp for Lee Dong Wook (btw, you were sadly correct in your warning that he's totally underwhelming in Life, Cho Seung Woo was the only person in that show I enjoyed) but I don't know if it would suit your mood at the moment because outside of some homoerotic vibes there's no romance in it.  \n\n2. While You Were Sleeping: This is what I would recommend for something that is fast paced and intriguing right away (the first episode is god tier) and has a good romance that acts as a sweet counterpoint to the more intense main plot.  I enjoyed this one a lot.\n\n3. Shopping King Louie:  I thought this show had a really cute, charming first half but then it totally stagnated and fell off a cliff in the second half.  \n\n4. Kill Me Heal Me:  This show seems really popular but I couldn't get into it and dropped it after five episodes.  The ML was good, everything else bored or annoyed me.  I did just finish and love The Devil Judge though, so if were interested in Kill Me Heal Me because of Ji Sung I'd recommend that because he gives an incredible performance there.",

I won\u2019t say it was a waste of time because I really enjoyed Lim Ji Yeon\u2019s character. \nLove with Flaws was entertaining and has good performances all around. I do feel like the story lagged a bit and then tied into a neat bow, but it wasn\u2019t bad at all. \nSoundtrack #1 is amazing and has solidified my love of Han So Hee. I can\u2019t wait for her performance in Gyeongseong Creature.",

In one of them, they showed the actor's POV as seeing faces that are blurred.  That annoyed me.  People with face blindness can see faces just like we do, it's just that they can't recognize them.  The best I've seen, and it might be in My Holo Love, they superimposed a sort of puzzle over the face of the person with the pieces scrambled.  Of course, it's impossible to \"show\" face blindness, but this was a good visualization of what it is.\n\nIn reality, we all have had bouts of face blindness.  Meeting someone that recognizes us but we have no clue who they are.  Or failing to recognize actors in a period piece because they all have the same headgear and clothing.",

Now do I endure through another season of this just for that one scene? \n\nI kept thinking if there is a korean remake of this drama (hopefully with a much tighter script!) I would love to see Lee Junho and Jisoo in the lead roles. \n\nI need to prepare myself for episode 2 of **Oasis**, been avoiding it as I didn't think I could watch it whilst being ill. \n\nAlso watching **Beyond Paradise**. Good to see Magpie Murders got made for TV, that's on my plan to watch list but have to wait and see when my husband wants to watch it.\n\nMy friend is visiting Korea next month, I keep sending her recommendations for places to visit.

What on earth is going on with product placement in TV dramas! Some of them are just embarrassing, like a character will use a product and then say 'hmm this tastes so nice and will help me achieve whatever I want in life' or 'this is so good for my skin' and another character will say 'oh yes you look amazing now because of it'.

            "comment": "**Chicago Typewriter** (2017) (Historical/Fantasy/RomCom/Mystery): Three people are connected by their past lives in the 1930's Japanese occupation of Korea which begin to unfold when they cross paths again.\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The bromance. ML and SML share a close and complicated friendship that spans lifetimes. It's given equal weight to and at times overshadows the romance; one of few Kdramas that might give you second lead syndrome with both FL and ML.  \n* The vintage fashion. Proof that three-piece suits are always in style.\n* The genre/trope grab bag. Romcom? Check. Political thriller? Sure. Whodunit Mystery? Of course. Ghosts? Yep. Magic? You betcha. Time Travel? Why not? All of it is worked into the narrative, and none of it feels gimmicky or out of place. \n* The metaphorical journey. Not only are the leads scarred by personal tragedy, they represent the shared trauma of a nation under occupation. In their struggle to understand and make peace with it, they personify the transition from war-torn past to more hopeful present. \n* The red threads. While FL, ML and SML are the center of the story, there's a tapestry of connection that weaves it way to touch the lives of other characters as well. They had and have a part to play in how it all plays out again.\n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The humor. Some of it is surprisingly ridiculous, which can be hit-or-miss.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The pacing. One of the slowest starts in Kdrama, because of...\n* The parallel plots. The past is an epic tragedy unfolding, the present is light-hearted romcom where FL, ML and SML all take turns being the third wheel. The two stories feel disconnected at first and take a while to reach equilibrium.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* Jin Soo Wan also wrote Moon Embracing the Sun (2012) and Kill Me, Heal Me (2015).\n* Kim Chul Gyu also directed Mother (2018) and Flower of Evil (2020).\n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* Most fantasy semi-sageuks involve the near (1980s and later) or distant (Joseon and earlier) past; CT's 1930s historical setting is both vividly realized and unique. \n\nIt's an 8.5/10 from me. Recommended if you're a fan of Goblin, bromance, layered narratives or plot-driven romcoms and have the patience for *very* meandering start as the story gets all its ducks in a row.",

For me it is the best gumiho drama.",

            "comment": "**Arang and the Magistrate** / Tale of Arang (2012) - takes place in Joseon and heaven. ML can see ghosts and FL is a virgin ghost who wants to know how/why she died.\n\n**Good Things:** Shin Min Ah and Lee Joong Gi from 10+ years ago! Fun Rom-com (with a murder mystery) with ghost, shaman, Grim Reapers, fighting scenes, and two gods up in heaven playing Go and watching the goings on from on high. (Heaven looks kind of cheesy, but it was fun to see.)\n\n**Bad Things:** If you are not a fan of the mix rom-com/murder mystery it may not be for you.  If you don't like the look of older dramas, it may not be for you.\n\n**Interesting Things:** [Yoo Seung Ho](https://mydramalist.com/people/589-yoo-seung-ho) plays one of the gods. I had seen him in other things later, and wondered why he looked so familiar.  Screenwriter is well known for *Misaeng: Incomplete Life*, a totally different genr\u00e9. The two directors have a lot of popular dramas under their belt.\n\n**Spotlight on Because** It was fun to see all these fantasy elements together. The heaven scenes kind of reminded me of a Chinese fantasy.",

            "comment": "**From Now On, Showtime!** (2022) (Supernatural/RomCom/Mystery): ML is an ex-shaman stage magician with a secret posse of spirits that help him with his act; FL is a police officer who convinces him to use his powers to help her.\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The communication. For a largely tongue-in-cheek romcom, the leads actually sit down and talk things out at important junctures. They're not exactly good at it, but they try; and that counts for a lot in a Kdrama.\n* The dog. Pets getting karmic closure was unexpected and delightful.\n* The entourage. ML's ghost employees (and the itinerant guests) are practically a Greek chorus. Their running commentary on anything and everything runs the gamut from hilarious to poignant, and it's one of the highlights of the show. \n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The hasty closure. The plot has a lot of loose ends to deal with, and the overall wrap-up is satisfying but kind of trite. \n* The octave change. Despite the horror/supernatural revenge murder mystery main plot, it's *very* slapstick until things start getting serious around midway and the shift in the characters and story is jarring.\n* The red flag SML. There's a love triangle, and he's a great big 'yikes' of a character.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The derivative story. If you've seen **Mystic Pop Up Bar**, a lot of the narrative elements are going to be very familiar. Which is iffy, because MPUB is an adaptation of a webtoon and the similarity skirts the line between imitative flattery and outright knock-off.\n* The episodic vs arching narrative. Both are rough around the edges, and it doesn't quite successfully pull off smoothly integrating them even with the help of &gt;!a two episode long sageuk flashback!&lt;. \n\n**Spotlight On Because:**\n\n* It's a homage to the complex, cross-genre romcom plots of the mid 2010s. FNOS! doesn't have the same depth as those older dramas, but it's still an enjoyable, nostalgic romp in the medium.\n\nIt's an 7.5/10 from me. Recommended if you enjoyed other karmic supernatural episodic mysteries like **Hotel Del Luna** / **May I Help You?** / **MPUB**, prefer comedies with a serious undertone or fun, frenetic stories with a little bit of everything.",

            "comment": "**Bulgasal: Immortal Souls (2021)**\n\n**Good things:** The drama had a pretty good storyline, connecting the past and the present lives of the characters. Maybe not the most unique plot, but it did tell the story really well. Just when you think you finally see the history of the main leads, there was just another layer of the plot to unravel after each episode.\n\n**Bad things:** The chemistry between the ML and FL fell a bit flat for me. I also couldn't find myself liking Kwon Nara's character so much as she had the poor kid/victim/damsel in distress vibe and not in a cute way, lol. There were also few episodes that became ***so*** repetitive with regards to the narrative, which made the middle part of the drama a bit slow.\n\n**Interesting things:** Definitely the folklore!! You get to see more creatures/monsters other than the typical Gumiho, and they presented them so well, each with their own stories!\n\n**Spotlight On because:** Not gonna lie, this isn't my go-to recommendation for fantasy dramas (Goblin will always be my first lol) but I just thought Bulgasal deserved more love! This is especially interesting for people who love monsters and all.\n\nTLDR interesting fantasy drama, but not without its faults :)",

I loved the sets and styling they used, very grungy \u2013 appropriate for our dark fantasy reincarnation thriller. I also felt Lee Joon's performance was standout!

            "comment": "**Alchemy of Souls**\n\nAlchemy of Souls is a fantasy K-Drama set in a different world with magic. The effects are a bit cheesy in the first episode as is the starting sequence (cheesy not just in effects but also story, acting, etc.) but it gets going quickly and it truly is my favorite K-drama of all time once it does. It\u2019s polarizing, some seem to hate it by the end for some reasons detailed in the spoiler below, but the humor is just incredible (Maidservant Kim\u2019s scenes with Park Jin, Mudeok\u2019s humor with CP - that wastewater scene!!), the acting is amazing, the chemistry is amazing, the music, it really has everything. I have never been more invested in a story as the romance in this one. Some people have complaints about plot holes, but having watched it a couple times I can say that a lot of the supposed plot holes actually were addressed in offhand manners and explained (some, not well, but many of the complaints actually miss details from prior episodes that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stand out until a rewatch). \n\nThat said, of course.. spoilers: &gt;!This show is polarizing, for, among other reasons, the swap of actresses between Part 1 and Part 2. Having watched the show and rewatched it, I\u2019m firmly in camp - this was planned from the beginning, it was not the result of any drama or slight against JSM, it makes sense, etc. but it is a big shift in the show, GYJ is beautiful but there is something lost when JSM leaves, I enjoy GYJ\u2019s chemistry with LJW but it is a very different kind of chemistry, and Part 2 definitely drags a bit at times (IMO) because the amnesia plot lasts way too long. In the end, I prefer Part 1. But Part 2 did not undermine my love for the show.!&lt; But notwithstanding those issues, I still love this show in an obsessive way. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll find another show I will feel this strongly about. I miss it.",

From a plot perspective, I thought part 1 did better but it was too long and part 2 was too short so there wasn\u2019t much they can flesh out but the amnesia plot that became a drag. From a chemistry standpoint, LJY and GYJ was on fire! That alone made me prefer P2 because I cared more to have a happy ending and I\u2019m so glad it was.",

                    "comment": "I agree with your review of AOS and agree, nothing against GYJ but something changed when JSM left. I don't think there was any bad blood between any of the crew of AOS and JSM. In a interview with Jae Wook, he said the creators approached him about doing part 2 during the filming of part one and in another interview with GYJ, she said she was only ever meant to be a cameo but the creators asked her to come back. So which would have us believe that the creators just wrote part one without part 2 in mind. I think its possible with the success that part one was having, they decided to do part two. Which would make sense as the writing in part two is very low par compared to part one, there was such a shift is quality in part two. If the creators had very little time to write part two, it would make sense. BTW those interviews I've mentioned, links have been posted on reddit months ago.",

But we may never get confirmation either way. For me watching season 2 and then rewatching s1 it all made sense that it was planned the way it worked out. I also don\u2019t think that your timeline makes sense in terms of filming and popularity. Story is something I expect was written well in advance of airing.",

They only came up with the story of part two during the filming of part one, they may have wanted 30 episodes but the concept of the last 10 episodes only happend during part one. They started filming part one in the summer of 2021, had a short break between parts and started filming part two in summer 2022. It seems part one was written and planned very much in advance but not part two. Plus if they had the whole story planned before filming part one, why was GYJ and LJW only asked to do part two during the filming of part one. I dont think the creators knew what was going to happen after part one, maybe they never thought it was going to be as popular and also needed a green light from netflix. JSM only ever agreed to do part one and no more due to work commitments Anyways, i guess it doesn't really matter now anymore...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/alchemyofsouls/comments/10g8h17/aos_pd_says_they_were_working_on_s2_concepts/",

I had to repeat  that scene!&lt;",

And it seems like Chief Oh was also one of them, along with Yura and Taegu!&lt;",

I fast forward a lot of scenes cause I really wanted to know about Yura and I'm glad they showed it on episode 5 and 6. I haven't watched episode 7 yet but i am glad to know they're showing a bit more. It's only 12 episodes anyway so things are going to unfold faster",

I wonder why writer-nim took so long when Kim Nam Hee is billed as a lead. \n\nI also think Chief Oh and Yura's connection is deeper than we think. The photo that was sent to her, and her interactions with Nabi (Butterfly), is hinting that Chief Oh was trained in the Union, and my theory is, she's the older girl in Yura's flashback. She recognised Yura, which is why she was drawn to her, but Yura did not recognise Chief Oh. \n\nNow that the Old Union Vs New Union plot is in place, things are starting to make sense. Again, I wished writer-nim came to this part much earlier.",

Instead, watch the spy Vs assassin part of the story. Jang Nara is carrying the core tension really well, and Jang Hyuk's fidgeting really adds to that. \n\nWith the revelation at the end of the episode, I'm curious how Dohoon and Yura's relationship will survive. Also, I take back what I said yesterday: Chief Oh did not recognise Yura. That said, it looks like by the next episode everything will be out in the open.",

When the show started l thought her daughter and her would have strained undertones in their relationship but l really thought that would be because her daughter wanted her to be more than just \"a housewife\", don't get me wrong this show is very much about how \"just a housewife\" is a superwoman and l think so too but its also about how a person's whole self and dreams shouldn't be characterized by other peoples' dreams. So in that sense l'd have thought her daughter would have wanted her mother to be someone with her own dreams and someone who could come to her career days and be a force to be reckoned with ...hence not a \"just a housewife\" \\_\\_ instead she judges her own mother's worth as far as her mother is useful to her own dreams",

The daughter is not pursuing her own interests because she is trying to get her dad's validation. So she feels like she's studying for the family's reputation. I think it's completely normal for the daughter to feel like her mom is abandoning her to pursue the dreams.\n\n- First of all, the daughter's world is so small and she doesn't know much about how families normally function. She doesn't know how tiring work is or anything about adulthood. \n- Her mom is the only person to whom she can express her emotions and she is the only person who takes care of her. \n- The mom becoming a resident happened so quickly that the daughter didn't get enough time to process. \n- The mom works where the dad and the elder son are at. She could feel left out. She thinks that the mom loves the brother more.\n- This adds to the pressure that she has to become a doctor.\n- We don't know what the situation was like when the son was preparing for the exams.\n\nI'm glad that the writers included this side of what happens to parent-child relationships when a stay-at-home parent starts working outside home while the other parent is emotionally unavailable. \n\nMy story: My dad is a perfectionist and always has high expectations for me. The conversations with my dad start and end with what I learned in school and my exam results. As soon as I come home, I go to my mom to talk about everything. When she started to work outside home, she was so tired and busy with housework to listen to my stories. I felt lonely and had so many emotions that I couldn't express.  It wasn't my mom's fault or anyone's fault. But that's how it is... Then, I started getting used to it.",

Although I do not like the daughter's character, but to me, she's written quite realistically and I can understand her thought process. It's also shown in the first episode where her mother is the only one that supports her passion in arts, so she probably felt betrayed and pressured to do medicine now that her mother is a doctor.\n\nShe is very spoiled tho and I dislike her for that, but I do think she's redeemable and they might show her slowly change / understand her mother's struggle better as the show goes. Unless she wants to become as insufferable as her parental grandmother lol",

It's such a painful experience being pushed out of the nest unexpectedly, especially when your siblings were coddled and cared for. My mom also decided to go back to school in her 40s while I was in HS, I was left to take care of my siblings and my dad to an extent and my resentment for her grew every single day until it came out, especially because I was also pursuing my degree for my father and hers sake. \n\nChildren are selfish and bratty, they want to take all your love till you have nothing left,until their world starts to get a bit bigger and they truly realize how hard it is out there. that felt like a very realistic 17 year old.",

I feel like this show would've been better set in the early 2000s or something, because currently, the number of Koreans in their 50s and above getting divorced is at an all time high, as the law makes it easier for them to separate than ever before. \n\nMarriage rates is also at an all time low! \n\nPersonally, I love it.

I went in with no expectations, but I have belly laughed at times, I've squealed and clapped my hands (Roy Kim on a motorbike anyone?) and I want to irrationally throw things at the tv when the husband and mistress is on screen.

And Doctor Roy really was like watching a show. perfect.By the way, the mistress's daughter gave the impression that she was not on good terms with her mother. I wonder if she knows she's having an affair  with a married man (maybe she doesn't know with whom). What do you think?\n\nI have to say that I also really like the relationship between the main character and her friend. I haven't seen such empowering female friendship in a long time!I loved that she wasn't upset for a moment that her friend blew off her vacation, but that they both screamed hysterically and were happy that she was accepted to the internship. Love it!.\n\nAnd a final note:I'm dying of laughter that all Korean dramas use the same hospital room for the VIP guests. The room in the episode was also used in Crash landing on you, Crash coures in romance and at list one more I remember. I'm starting to think it's a TV studio.",

I think that Seung-hui and her ex divorced because the ex found out about Seung-hui\u2019s cheating and which the daughter found out much later on. That\u2019s why she keeps dropping hints at Dr. Cha\u2019s house.\n\nedit: By \u201cshe,\u201d I mean Seung-hui\u2019s daughter.",

The acting is great and somehow pulls off cheesy at times without being cheesy. The comedy is perfect where it needs to be. And the serious parts are so insightful and poignant.\n\nThis is feminism portrayed in such an interesting way. As a reformed people pleaser here, I can\u2019t wait to see how Dr. Cha continues to surprise herself and stand up for herself. \n\nThe husband\u2026what a POS. Awful human being. The actor is doing a great job because I hate him so much, haha. The comedic and ridiculous moments do make his character more interesting to watch but I hate him. And his mistress too. So shameless. I can\u2019t stand infidelity usually in dramas so this part is hard for me to watch, but the rest makes it great. I hope karma gets them for the damage they\u2019ve caused. And when they get caught\u2026that\u2019s going to be so ugly. \n\nSome other random points: \n\n- the cute moments between mother and son at the &gt;!hospital, working together.!&lt; make me smile.\n\n- the hot American doctor - \ud83d\ude0d he has the best lines.\n\n- the horrid MIL - is there a white truck \ud83d\udefb anywhere?\n\n10/10 so far.",

We think she is clueless for a moment but then realize that she is no idiot when she drops the fact that her husband never mentioned that his first love worked at the hospital.\n\nI loved the shock on the mistress's face &gt;!when she realized that our FL was working here, followed by a panic attack from the cheating husband.!&lt;\n\nWhat is it with IV drips in Korean hospitals?  Take two aspirins and call me in the morning seems to have been replaced by an IV drip. They seem used for every type of ailment.  I also find it funny when one character will suggest to another a hospital visit for the slightest of ailments.  I guess K-dramas have no notion of crowded ERs.\n\nOoooh the cutie doctor &gt;!will be working at the same hospital too.  I don't think they will be friends. Lol, is his father Trump?&lt;! \n\nGrrr tell the old bag to mind her own business and the spoiled brat to grow up.  They can hire a housekeeper.  With 3 doctors working they more than can afford it.  So far the only person in that family that I like is the son, who, while worried, supports his mother.\n\nGod what an asshole he is.  There is keeping your relationship a secret and there is actively sabotaging your wife.  I'll repeat Roy's question.  &gt;!When are you getting a divorce?!&lt;\n\nAs an aside, can you really go back to being a resident, 20 years after you completed med school?  Seems to be that your schooling would be way out of date.\n\nETA  The ending of that episode was pure gold.  &gt;!I just loved all the subtext.  The husband worried about what she will do or say, Roy observing all of this with a half smile, thoroughly entertained. The strange jealousy exhibited by the husband.  How can he be jealous when he doesn't even like his wife?  The son stuck between the two.  And the doctor, does she have her eye on the son?  She is acting weirdly jealous.!&lt;\n\nIt's early days but I am really enjoying this show.",

Neither could have known that she was pregnant, so back then, he and Doctor Cha did their thing unknowingly she was pregnant and in the meantime he went back to the mistress cause they were a legit item and then during that time he had gotten her pregnant too.

It's really cool and wierd that our voices can age faster due to how we use our vocal chords. \n\nI also found out that she is 54 irl and she looks younger than that (42 imho). Her ML husband is 48 in real life and he looks definetly like 57 (he must be a smoker) and then we have SML and he is 41 but looks like 45 - isn't it refreshing to cast not after age but after how they look - it matches more well compared to western tv-series where the age diffrence is rediculous and more in tune with ageism where women don't get casted past a certain age while the men have 15-20 year younger wifes... Then we have the funny situation with casting FLs mother who isn't that much older irl.. Tbh I wish Mother in law and mother where older- realistically they should be 70 or 80 now. I want greyish hair and grandma faces not people who look like in thier late 50s. It's absurd. The actress who plays her mother is btw 59 for reference. I hope we get older women beeing casted as grandmas it would add more realism.",

Most of the characters are driving me crazy. I feel like how she feels when she witnesses how her son is treated. I just want to help her.\n\nOmg, when the whole sequence of finding a donor happened. I thought it was a dream sequence. But that was her reality. It was so messed up.\n\nI really hope this drama picks up with character development. It\u2019s looking like the husband and the mistress are the main characters right now.\n\nEdit: After ep 4, I don\u2019t think I can hold out until ep 8 to make an assessment. I just hate her family so much. Their behavior is not even in jest. They just suck. As much as I want to see her blossom, it\u2019s so frustrating and stressful watching this. It glorifies cheating and tries to make it humorous. &gt;!Her husband has been cheating on her for over a decade. But he has the nerve to feel jealous when she\u2019s interacting with other people. It\u2019s unbelievable that him and the mistress walk around like they\u2019re owed their relationship. F these people. The mistress\u2019s daughter is suffering too. Maybe I can\u2019t look past these things and enjoy the comedic parts. It\u2019s toxic. This whole web is toxic.!&lt;\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m surprised that she\u2019s never attended a work event with her husband after all these years. That just adds to the crap behavior she\u2019s had to endure all these years. None of his coworkers know her. They don\u2019t even know that he\u2019s married with kids.

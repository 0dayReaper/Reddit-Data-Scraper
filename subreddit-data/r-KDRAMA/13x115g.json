    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted.

I don\u2019t usually notice the music in dramas that much but this time I bought the soundtrack. I know it\u2019s very famous and I don\u2019t know why I put off watching it so long. Next I think I\u2019m going to watch something lighter that doesn\u2019t grab me by the heart as much because I need to rest!",

I thought it wasn't quite as refined and well-crafted as Extraordinary Attorney Woo, but it made up for that by being emotionally richer and deeper. There were several similarities that I'm assuming Woo swiped, like the traitorous young colleague who's a spy for the other side, parental abandonment, nepotism, public perceptions getting in the way of romance, etc. But I thought both shows were well worth watching and glad they both exist. Now I'm looking forward to the Japanese version. Not really interested in the American version though.",

It is heavily focused on the patient stories, rather than the ML and his autism. They also completely cut out the romance storyline, which I think was a very important storyline in the kdrama version. But they only had 10 episodes so i get it. It's a perfectly fine drama for people who enjoy medical dramas in general",

As a medical drama it really delivered - emotional but in a way that got to me. As for the romance aspect &gt;!when she told him she thought of him as a little brother I thought I was going to have to sit through a dozen episodes of her getting with the other doctor and him trying to get over her and I almost wanted to stop watching. So I was overjoyed when that didn\u2019t happen.!&lt; \n\nSo yes, I really enjoyed this one. I\u2019m also curious about the Japanese version and not that interested in the American one.",

And like you, I had some doubts about the romance aspect at certain points, and I think that could have been handled more skillfully, although ultimately I was satisfied. Thankfully, the happy moments and triumphs by the protagonist overall outweighed the pain and abuse and differential treatment he got.",

Its plot is something I usually dislike (stuck-up city girl falling for a country boy and \"reforming\") but I got thoroughly charmed by the storytelling, the actors, the slow paced romance + strong chemistry and the setting of the vineyard. Despite its issues - it shows its age in some ways - I ended up totally enjoying it and its handling of the FL changing herself. Also led me to stumble upon yet another musical theatre star - the ML - Oh Man Seok - is a major musicals/stage artist. I should have realised it when the show included several scenes of him singing (very well I might add)! But originally his MDL profile didnt have any info regarding his singing prowess, i stalked him and then updated his MDL bio with my discoveries.",

OST was also much better, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, FtLY is one of the few instances where \"noble idiocy\" trope actually makes a lot of sense and completely understandable.",

It\u2019s definitely not a new problem for me but it\u2019s gotten considerably worse IMO, they barely hook me anymore. Even my teen nieces who got into kdramas like 2 years ago have moved on from them because they said they would get boring after awhile and hardly finished any. They mostly watch Chinese dramas now but I can\u2019t get into them tbh. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m about to finish Drinking Solo, Money Flower and Tunnel and enjoying them very much. I recently finished Fight for My Way and it\u2019s one of my favorite rom com tv shows, the casting of the leads was superb, I need them in another drama together.",

            "comment": "I just finished **Hogu's Love** (2015) and wow do I feel conflicted about this drama. It tells the story of the unlikely romance between Ho Gu, a schlubby self-described squid and Do Do Hui, a beautiful woman who is a medal winning competitive swimmer.\n\nThe parts of this drama that worked really really worked but the parts that didn't work were so bad that they almost ruined the whole thing.\n\n**What Worked:**\n\n1. **The Female Lead**: I loved Do Do Hui because she's a FL that you don't often see in Kdramas: at the start she's cold, harsh and aloof but as you get to know her you understand why: people are always treating her as an object of desire or trying to get something from her and she doesn't have anyone in her life who she can trust. I've seen people say they hate her which is kind of a bummer because she's one of the most complex and interesting FL's I've seen in a long time\n2. **The Second Male Lead**: Byeon Kang Cheol was a fantastic character who got saddled with a shitty storyline. I still loved him because he was kind of ridiculous but he grew a lot over the course of the drama, evolving from a vain lawyer living  a sterile and lonely life to a person who enjoyed eating raw squid and soju and singing at the noraebang with friends. The actor did a fantastic job playing him.\n3. **Supporting Cast**: Hogu's parents, his friends, Byeon Kang Cheol's parents and his secretary were all terrific and added a lot to their scenes.\n4. **Creative Storytelling and Humor**: There's a lot of slapsticky humor which is normally not my kind of thing but I loved most of it. There's also a lot of creative fantasy sequences and one epic scene where high school boys brawling over a naked drawing of the FL fall into poses from famous paintings. Hogu's squid meltdown (you have to see it to understand what I mean) was another epic moment.\n\n**What Was So-So**\n\n1. **Ho Gu was a frustrating character.** Sometimes he was sweet and adorable and other times I wanted to strangle him because he kept being presumptuous and sticking his nose where it didn't belong. It was especially galling when he did things without asking Do Do Hui first. I will say it got better as the character evolved and matured. His final reconciliation with Do Do Hui was lovely.\n\n**What Didn't Work At All**\n\n1. **The drama brings up serious issues** like &gt;!sexual assault, abortion, single motherhood, suicide, slut shaming, etc. !&lt;The problem is it either deals with them perfunctorily &gt;!(for example, leaving the assault trial for the very end of the last episode)!&lt; or really poorly &gt;!(very negative messages about abortion which I did not need to see when the US has abortion access being destroyed)!&lt;. There's also a major Coffee Prince-esque storyline that played is he or isn't he gay for the entire drama and it's wildly insensitive. I kept shouting at my screen JUST LET HIM BE GAY, GAWD.\n2. **Ho Gu's sister was manipulative and a raging asshole** with a violent streak and I never liked her.\n\n**Do I recommend you watch this?** Maybe. You'd have to be willing to overlook a lot, esp. the gay identity storyline, but the characters are mostly wonderful and the relationship between Ho Gu and Do Do Hui is incredibly heartwarming. I tend to drop dramas very easily but this one hooked me from beginning to end and that's saying something.",

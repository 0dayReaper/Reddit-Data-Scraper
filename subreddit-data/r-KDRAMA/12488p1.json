    "postText": "Which dramas have you given up on this month? (And why?)\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we  encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they dropped certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas  without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all.  This serves to both inform others who may be wary of certain aspects of dramas they wish to avoid and others who have watched the dramas in full  may be able to encourage users to pick up dramas again in the future if  the problems they had were only momentary aspects of the drama.\n\n**Please remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.** \n\n***Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.***\n\nWhen participating in this discussion remember, whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. **Be kind to one another.**\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

Especially looking at how she gets bullied for no valid reason whatsoever, I can't help but think of how someone's way of fun turns another person's world upside down. Maybe it wasn't the drama, it was just my overthinking that made me drop it, I dont really know",

I really liked both the comedy and romance involved but why oh why is there a random serial killer-psycho plot that I just think is unnecessary. Lately, I haven't been interested in much 'cutesy' romance but CCIR felt like a breath of fresh air to me, I was wholeheartedly enjoying it. But that switch to the thriller/mystery plot makes me lose interest so quickly. Hopefully, I can finish off those last 3?? episodes someday.",

            "comment": "**Boys Over Flowers** due to FL\u2019s worst performance in a drama and the actors playing her family as runners up. Low production value, casual misogyny, so-so acting from the rest of the cast, awful mother-in-law, didn\u2019t put me off the way FL did. \n\nIn a bad drama take your joy where you can. Did appreciate the (unintended?) humor value of teenage chaebol boys drinking juice out of Burgundy glasses at Michelin star-type restaurants and hitting on the female chef like they were supposed to have a chance. Did LOL when a flashback to Lee Min Ho\u2019s character as a tiny boy showed him with the same aggressively curling ironed hairstyle. \n\nI did watch the last episode and FL\u2019s acting was slightly improved. But helicopter on the beach? No one who\u2019s ever been around helicopters would think that\u2019s a good idea. He should have rappelled off the skid, that would have been way more macho sexy and in line with how over the top so many things were.",

Unfortunately the writing (writer is Hyun Ji Min) so far has sorely disappointed with some pretty bad characterizations and forced dialogue that feels too heavy-handed. Personal preference is obviously in play here -- I love moral ambiguity and anti-heroes in my makjang dramas but hate too-obvious stupidity and sadly one of the main characters (&gt;!Hae Soo!&lt;) has displayed *way too much* stupidity for me to tolerate. Pity since the production values of the drama are great. Might be time for a rewatch of **Penthouse** instead.\n\n*Details of the Stupidity (from my perspective):*\n\nOne of the lead female characters (&gt;!Hae Soo!&lt;) discovers &gt;!that a dear friend of hers whom she treats like an older sister was/is a trained assassin known by the code 50. And code 50 is the one that assassinated her father ~15 years ago via sniper gun. When the assassination took place, both of them would have been in their early 20s at most if not younger. Instead of putting her investigative reporter hat on (she's an announcer/reporter) and thinking of digging into who ordered the hit, she turns all her anger and thoughts of revenge onto this 'older sister', including taking and using her daughter as a threat!&lt;. I just can't deal with the stupidity of her not even trying &gt;!to dig into what actually happened back then given the known facts (highly trained sniper assassination that clearly hints there is a backstory to the hit) and instead going on a rampage *only* against the person who pulled the trigger, someone not much older than herself!&lt;. I don't know what she thinks she can get out of this situation with her rage, certainly not revenge.\n\nETA: Clarified that the writer is Hyun Ji Min as Kim Soon Ok is only the creator.",

Was too lazy to look up her name when I was writing the comment initially.\n\nI'm really disappointed that one of the main characters has been given such a bad characterization, especially since the premise/setup of the story seemed so interesting. I've seen a few clips from the latest episode in my feed and maybe I'm seeing things out of context but it seems like &gt;!Hae Soo had confronted Tae Ra in a public interview on whether she's a trained assassin!&lt;, if she actually did that, I don't think there are enough words in the universe to describe the stupidity of that move.",

But overall it was too much. The FL's behavior was so inappropriate, the storyline about the loan shark seemed too over the top. I watched 3 episodes at 1.25 speed, then decided to only watch the interactions between the OTP--that got me through episode 7. And then I was done. I'll find other dramas to fit those categories. \n\nJust no.",

I just can't  get into the romance,  their interaction is so awkward to watch.I know irl they have a big age gap and in the show they're supposed to be similar age but it didn't seem that way at all,  the FL just acted very young, her baby voice doesn't help.",

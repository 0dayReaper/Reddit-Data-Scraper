One of my favourite kdrama romances of the last couple of years really made the age gap work in My Liberation Notes. \n\nIf its not for you, that's cool, but for others just wait and see how it plays out yeah?",

While there are people who can make age gaps work, there are also older people who take advantage of younger, less experienced partners.\n\nBut I am also speaking from personal experience. I was the 18yo getting asked out by people in their 30s. Took a while for me to question why they were trying to date someone over a decade younger and it usually wasn't for good reasons.",

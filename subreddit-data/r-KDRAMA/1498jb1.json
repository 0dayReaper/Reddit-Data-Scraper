I also found myself rooting for her. \n\nWhen KHI attacked BJN first, I knew that I'm rooting for BJN from then on. It's really difficult to root for someone who's lacking any complexity.",

She attacked BJN out of nowhere. Who does that? It's not like it's the only shoes being sold in the store. KHI wouldn't have been in her radar if she didn't throw the first stone. It was game on the moment she attacked BJN. \n\nI sympathize with BJN more than KHI. BJN is bad but at least we know how she became like that. KHI is just a mess. I find her insufferable. It's really hard to root for her.\n\nI have a hunch that it was SDE who killed KHI. The show is hinting that it was BJN who pushed the doppelganger from the roof but I think it was SDE. The storyline is getting interesting. \n\nI thought KHI was smart but all of her acts is just one wrong thing after another. The only person who was genuinely kind to her was LSM. She should have stuck with him instead of SDE who has ulterior motive. But I can't blame her because she has to have shield. \n\nThe artist girl who saved her is probably the one who stole her shoes and left her the note in her locker. I don't understand why she's targeting KHI instead of the killer. I mean, KHI shouldn't have leveraged her knowledge about what happened but it's unfair to blame everything on her. She didn't push the doppelganger.  \n\nI'm disappointed with her friend. She's older. She should have advised KHI on what not to do. Also, I don't understand why they went back to the middle schooler after everything that happened. Jesus. It's one wrong decision after another.\n\nAnyway, I'm still hooked in this series. The plot is interesting and I love Yeri. I just wish KHI was more tolerable.",

Maybe they haven\u2019t really shown her true side or whatever but I don\u2019t find her that big of a bully. She\u2019s arrogant but I don\u2019t see any extreme bullying from her. Also since Yeri is playing the role idk why but I just find it hard to picture Je na as this bully. Like for eg in the Glory, I hated the bullies with my whole art cause they were so extreme and horrible, but we haven\u2019t really gotten any of those scenes from Je na, she just seems like a spoilt teenager with  anger issues where as Hye in is just not a lead i want to support. I would have felt bad for her but she reminds me of the lead from \u2018golden spoon\u2019. Both of them hated themselves for being poor and were too desperate to \u2018fit in\u2019 and be rich. It\u2019s hard to root for such characters because they are flawed and if not given a meaningful backstory like some emotional instance that made them that way, maybe some hard core bullying they went through, without that, you just don\u2019t feel sad for the character.",

    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

It's a little campy, but I'm enjoying it for all the actors in their younger roles.",

It\u2019s been really interesting reading all the comments in the various threads dedicated to it. There were on air discussion threads, Weekly Binge discussions, and many other reviews. Second lead syndrome featured prominently, and lots of comments around how FL was never ugly even when she was supposed to be. ML was definitely an a$$ in the first half, although I don\u2019t think it was ever because he thought FL was ugly. \n\nAnyway, I have ticked another Park Seo Joon drama off my list and I can put it towards my kdrama challenge.",

I'm trying to get used to the changes of both ML and FL actors in season 2, but both are great in their own way. Trying to catch up to season 3, but don't think I can make it",

Normally he really pours on the charm, and it was interesting to see how he could pull that off with a narcistic charater, playing it deadpan. However for me, that perhaps due to script and direction, I find the FL played by Shin Se-kyung irritating. I know the part is being played for laughs but, so far, I am not connecting with the actress or the character in this drama. The second ML played by Lim Ju-hwan cracked me up when he said that trying to learn how to pull off humor is very difficult. Had to inwardly chuckle, as I was wondering if the show was teasing itself with that line. Not my favorite drama, but will stick it out to the end it the hopes that it gets better.",

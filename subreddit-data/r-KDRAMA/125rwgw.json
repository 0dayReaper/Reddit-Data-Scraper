He comes from a small rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul \u2013 and the same university \u2013 after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends. Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone \u2013 and share a kiss. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?

And with 10 40minute episodes this is pretty close to a full length drama, which is kinda nice for a BL.\n\nThe only thing that scares me is that intro. Is this going to be super tragic?",

Can't believe a KBL gave us this.\n\nThe looks JiHyun and JaeWon share have strong physical attraction written all over them. The way JiHyun pursues JaeWon by enrolling in the surf club. The way JaeWon understands that but is trying to be the responsible senior and not take advantage of the younger, vulnerable boy from a small town. I guess there is a 4-5 year age gap here with JH being a freshman and JW being the final year student who has also completed the 2 year military service. \n\nIt's a very interesting dynamic - JH is bold enough to get into the surf club to be close to JW, but he also tells JW clearly that he is afraid of this new big city (and the big city wolves?). Will JW be able to stop himself from being a wolf, especially when JH looks so willing to be seduced by him?\n\nThe actors are perfect, not just the leads but the supporting cast too. They look like the college students they are meant to be. I am so completely hooked already! Praying this one doesn't follow the usual KBL practice of starting strongly and finishing with a whimper.",

While JW is more worldly and outwardly confident, he seems less certain about what to do with his attraction to JH. JH might be a quiet country mouse, but he is very sure about his attraction to JW and not afraid to pursue it. It would be a nice twist if when it came to dating another guy JH was more experienced and confident.",

            "comment": "Oof that run time! Love it. And the opening credits and cinematography are stunning! Now that closing credit song of \"Who\" by Wetter from the first episode? I fell down a rabbit hole listening to as much of their music as I could get ahold of. I have never heard of them (an indie group so not surprised) but I might be in love. A lot of their music is in English and they do a lot of social commentary on South Korea and its culture. The name of the band is because they want listeners to get \"emotionally wet\" listening to their music, which is interesting. They are on hiatus right now due to military obligations in case anyone else is curious.\n\nAnyway, I hope this one isn't sad. It's very melo so far so I am definitely worried. And I hope the emergency at the beginning is maybe Jae Won's brother who was mentioned. Still tragic but not the mains crappy ever after and instead is a story telling medium/plot point.\n\nSo far the chemistry between the leads is good. The tension has been thick, to the point the female ex rightly noticed, which is impressive. And surfing is interesting too. Not done too often. This one looks like it has such intense promise! I hope so.",

Recently I was trying to look for it so I could watch it because it seemed fun but I don't know the name of the k drama. All I know from the clips I watched was that the protagonist was considered \"fat\" and she had a handsome boyfriend. People were confused as why he was with her. And when they met in high school she was skinny and pretty so she was starting to get insecure about why he likes her because shes not \"pretty\" anymore (I think). But he loves her anyway. (I also think he wasn't considered handsome when he was young). I also remember that she and her friends used to gather in a sort of coffee shop and she liked to eat sweets there. That's all I know about the series. Please help me find it I'm starting to lose it because i looked everywhere! Thanks",

As a middle-aged adult, FL has become fat. A mysterious perfume is sent to her and she looks like her 20 year old self while the perfume is working. At a certain point she is with a handsome man, even when she is fat. He knows her for who she is inside. So it doesn't have a high school part, just college flashbacks.\n\nGood luck finding what you saw. Maybe try one of the other Asian Drama subs  if no one here recognises it?",

The overarching plot moved very slowly, and the villain is a little too cartoon villain-y for me. I think they could have done a little more throughout examining the nature/nurture of having a brain theoretically leaning toward psychopathy. It seems to be coming on really strong just at the end. Like the first little arc had some switch flip in his brain where he like physically kicked the dude/inflicted violence in a way that made it seem like it was important, but we almost never revisited that. \n\nThis may just be the fact that I've watched two kdramas (Mouse and Come and Hug Me) and am currently watching one cdrama (Justice in the Dark) drama dealing with this theme - but it was done relatively well in those. Feels clunky here.\n\nRegardless, we ride into the finale!",

It's a theme they could have woven through a lot better than they have. It doesn't need to be the *focus* as it's obviously an over the top comedy. But they could have done a better job, imo. I'm still enjoying it, though.\n\nRe: Justice in the Dark - I'm loving it. I'm actually frustrated because they released 8 eps and then have said not a word since. It seems like it may be on hold until April pending some political stuff happening in March. They added a sci-fi angle (basically identifying a genetic sequence for psychopaths) and re-named everyone to distance it from the novel due to censorship of BL stuff. But the actual story is a pretty straight adaptation. Zhang XinCheng is also *excellent* as Fei Du (aka Pei Su)",

And the ending is that all of a sudden this useless piece of shit loser 'wins' because he stole all of his boss's money?? And okay the three who killed Min gets arrested finally... okay, then what? There is some finger pointing towards each other which is fine, but... so what?  Also, our boy Mark getting freaking capped for no real reason on the final scene makes minimal sense. The entirety of S2 kinda meandered and felt disjointed to the character they tried to portray in Moosik in general... like he was one to have a tough front, but also gave people way more chances than they deserved.  The whole thing reminded me of S8 of GoT lol. This show had a lot of potential, but.... the final season really fell flat for me.  !&lt;",

Mustache guy was such a weasel...  anyone with eyes could see it, but Mr. Cha liked him for some inexplicable reason...  I would have killed both mustache guy and baldy at the first sign of trouble and hired assassin guy as my number one right hand man and only trusted him...  no one else.  At least Assassin guy only turned on him when he was tortured and had no choice.!&lt;",

I think the series took a lot of inspiration from Scorsese films - like Moo-sik narrating his days growing up felt like it took after \"Goodfellas\".\n\nWith that said, when I think about the series as a whole, diving so far back into Moo-sik's childhood didn't really feel like it added anything to what occurred in the present. It probably would've served the series better if all the scenes in his youth were more or less removed and they spent more time in the present day (at least starting with his initial foray into the gambling ring business in SK).\n\nProbably rate the series a 6 or 7 out of 10. Can't really recommend it to anybody, but it was enjoyable watching it as it came out at least.\n\nWas really hoping Sang-gu and Mark were gonna make it. sadge",

And he tells Jung-pal where it is? I thought Moo-sik was smart.!&lt;\n2. &gt;!And why does Moo-sik keep So-jeong and Philip's passports? Why does he not burn them along with the CCTV video that implicates him in their murders?!&lt;\n3. &gt;!He kills Raoul and makes an enemy out of Daniel? That also seems very dumb.!&lt;\n4. A lot of pointless storylines. It was odd that Tae-seok was murdered by cobras and no one ever mentioned him again. Not even the policeman Seung-hoon? After Tae-seok had a gunfight at the casino, and Seung-hoon was outraged by Mark handing him over to Moo-sik? Seems like Seung-hoon would care about his body that's found after a bunch of cobras chomped on it.\n5. And Yang Sang-soo. When he appeared, they made it look like he was going to be some big deal. But Moo-sik gave him a verbal spanking and we never heard from him again. There are so many characters who were introduced and seemed like they would be significant, but ended up doing nothing.\n\nI could go on and on. But in general, this was just a lot of wasted potential.\n\nThe good:\n\nChoi Min-sik. He exudes so much charisma that he repeatedly stares people down when they literally point a gun at his head, and he wins. He regularly tells off law enforcement in both countries and they actually listen. Honestly, that was amusing the first 3 times or so, but then it got old. His charisma alone got over a lot of hiccups in the story. But that ultimately didn't make up for the sloppy story.\n\nLee Je-hoon cameo! Choi Mu-seong cameo! Kind of wanted Taek's dad to slap some sense into Dong-ryong (played by actor playing Jeong-pal, *Reply 1988* reference). That would have been funny.\n\nThe bad:\n\nStoryline is a mess. The bad guys were really stupid and clumsy. Yeong-hee and those other two guys were just idiots. I thought Yeong-hee's boyfriend was a mafia boss. How's he so sloppy? It's not fun to watch criminals being caught when they are so dumb.\n\nAnd Cha Moo-sik seemed really smart in Part  1, but incredibly dumb in Part 2.\n\nChoi Min-sik's English. It wasn't good but it needed to be good. There are deleted scenes (that weren't on Hulu, I think) that show younger Cha Moo-sik (Lee Kyu-hyeong) and what happened to him in the army, and how he earned his wife's parents' approval. They both have to do with how smart he is and how good he is at English. Remember also that before he got into casinos, Moo-sik operated a successful English tutoring school. Those scenes were probably deleted because Cha Moo-sik actually can't speak English well.\n\nIn general, *Big Bet* had some great moments. But I can't recommend this. You can tell Disney+ spent $$$ on this, hoping that it would really elevate their K-drama offerings. Didn't quite work. A disappointment.",

            "comment": "This series imo needs to be remade into a new one with a similar premise. Once you take a step back from the series and look at the plot points and character development, it was just plain and uneventful. Season 2 in particular began to really drag. It could have been just 6 episodes, but by episode 2 I was checked out. Choi Min Sik is a legacy actor, I love his older movies, but this performance? not up to par. Every time he spoke english, he literally broke character and couldn\u2019t maintain who he apparently was supposed to be when speaking in Korean. For a good comparison, Son Suk-ku did an amazing job creating an original character regardless of language. Whether in korean or english his character was seamless.   \nI see this problem a lot in Korean Actors when taking english speaking roles. Because they are so foreign to the language/culture tied to it, or lack the research into the role, they project a commonly cliche/cringey idea of what the english speaking version of the character should be; so it comes off inauthentic and literally unbelievable. Same thing happened with Mah Dong Seok in The Eternals. Yes he speaks english well, but was he a believable original character? No, He was just Mah Dong Seok in a marvel outfit with B- level acting.  It was more of an attempt to create an international cast. Now have you seen any of Mah dong seoks movies in Korean? Amazing. Believable and Original character profiles. Ok, beating a dead horse.   \nRegardless, for a show like this to come out on Hulu/Disney+, I expected a lot more. It was trying to be Netflix\u2019s Narcos, but it couldn\u2019t hold. The show could have been darker, deeper, but it just didn\u2019t hit the mark. If Moosik was a casino runner with that much influence, I\u2019d imagine a darkness and power like they portrayed in \u201cNew World\u201d (which Choi Min Sik did phenomenal in!!).  Big Bet had so much potential but the writing and acting was so inconsistent.   \n   \nMVP in my opinion goes to Son Suk-ku, and he should get a spin off.",

            "comment": "No words, so many emotions, no words. Yet I'm going to proceed to write a paragraph. Firstly, yea jungpal is absolute trash he can suck my dick, scum. Cha Moosik should've shot him in season 1, like it literally makes me tear up when I think about that one scene when they were driving together, listening to music n vibing... WHY :,,,,( and he even cooked SHRIMP for this fucking idiot and he didn't even touch it, so rude omg. But at the same time i kind of love the ending, I thought it fit the show perfectly. The series doesn't show many sentimental scenes, except maybe in the beginning for the backstory. I thought the way Cha Moonsik went out was perfect for the way he lived his life, i mean he did murder several people, he got what he deserved. Jungpal will probably die in a similar way soon too, that idiot can not last long at all. It's the cycle lol. Ending sucked, but i mean there's no show without Cha Moonsik so there isn't much they could show anyway lol. Acting was phenomenal. To whoever said they thought the English was cringe, you try growing up an orphan barely having the proper assistance to learn your own language and then move to another country as an adult to learn a secondary language, Choi Min Sik absolutely nailed it. \n\nAnyway lol loved the show :p",

            "comment": "It was a hard one to choose between Ro-sa/Jong-Su and Shin Woo Yeo/Lee Dam. I really loved Roommate is a Gumiho very much. But it's just too hard to vote against Rosa and Jong-Su. They are a wonderful couple. They are so supporting of each other in those years of life. Haha- Shin Woo Yeo is even older.....  But still, there's something so realistic and heart-warming about Rosa and Jong-Su. Both of these couples (well, 3 people out of 4)  lived full lives and now, after many years, have found love and are completely enjoying each others' company as they do the simplest things.  I love it!  And that's why we love kdrama.",

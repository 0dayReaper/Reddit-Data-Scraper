But more importantly if they hit THE #1 GLOBAL spot for non English shows.\n\nThe very few mega hits on this list that hit Global #1 are Squid Game (broke both Netflix and Korean show records), All of Us are Dead, Extraordinary Atty Woo and now The Glory.",

From what I have noticed, korean production teams don't have the same level of attachment to the project as American's do. One great actor would not play cool lawyer for six years. The only way they would is if the show became the talk of the country (Squid Game) or if the seasons were pre-planned and approved in advance (Love Alarm). The Glory might as well get it, but if it doesn't, it's more likely because Kim Eun Sook and Song Hye Gyo already have enough ultra hits under their belt and don't really need to milk this one project dry.",

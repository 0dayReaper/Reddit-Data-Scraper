At A Distance Spring is Green\n9. Weak Hero Class 1\n10. Chicago Typewriter\n\nI made a top ten list about 2 years ago and half of these were on my list then, and the other half have unseated my favorites in the last 8 months or so. My qualifiers to be in my top ten are quality, re-watchability, and engaging characters/actors. I tend to gravitate to thrillers and darker dramas, but I do have a few lighter shows that I just love to re-watch and are my comfort shows.",

            "comment": "**1) Reply 1988** \\- &gt;!\u201cThat might be why youth is beautiful. It shines, blindingly bright, for just an instant. But, you can never go back.\u201d!&lt; This was such a special show it\u2019s hard to talk about. I know the residents of that Ssangmun street better than I know most of my friends. &gt;!The broken street and empty shells in the last 10 minutes of the last episode fills me with the happiest sadness.!&lt;  \n\n**2) My Mister** \\- Park Dong-hoon\u2019s voice is steamed milk over espresso, and the ache and fatigue in his words so richly conveys the daily misery he suffers in a life gone askew. Lee Ji-ah is beautiful, but her feral desperation for anything stable or reliable to clutch onto triggered in me a paternal, rather than amorous, desire to comfort. This was a beautiful, gray, grim story &gt;!of two unhappy people who connect and relate and understand and save each other. !&lt;It\u2019s one of the greats. \n\n**3) Twenty Five Twenty One** \\- &gt;!Na Hee-do said her fondest memory was getting to be Ko Yu-rim\u2019s rival.!&lt; But for me, Na Hee-do, you were peerless. This is my favorite character I have seen in any KDrama and I can\u2019t imagine her losing that spot anytime soon. If you\u2019ve seen it you know. She is just an amazing force and Kim Tae-ri as Hee-do was endlessly captivating. \n\n**4) My Name** \\- A compact, brutal story &gt;!that had echos of The Departed!&lt;. I was halfway through the series when I looked up the FL; stunned this was the same glassy wallflower in Nevertheless. Han So-hee crushed this. \n\n**5) It\u2019s OK to not be OK** \\- My second KDrama and wow did this set the bar high. An examination of trauma and coping, disability and growth. Seo Yea-ji was brilliant as the beautiful but hard Ko Moon-young, and Kim Soo-hyun contrasted and complimented her so well as the tender Moon Gang-tae. Ko Moon-young\u2019s encounter with the water deer had me laughing for minutes. \n\n**6) One Spring Night** \\- Beauty in the ordinary seems to be the goal of this writer/director duo, and they nailed it with this one. It\u2019s lovely, slow and internal, and much more polished than their previous \u201cSomething in the Rain.\u201d &gt;!I particularly appreciated how the banker boyfriend is more of a tragic figure due to being emotionally clueless than he is a villain.  !&lt;\n\n**7) All of Us Are Dead** \\- It\u2019s too uneven to be great, but in it\u2019s best parts it was genuinely thrilling and dreadful. The lunch scene to start episode 2 was amazing film making and I don\u2019t know how they pulled it off. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s one continuous take from 2:31 to 5:18 and the camera switches at least twice between handheld and floating/on wires, but the scene never cuts. I don\u2019t get it, but it was awesome. \n\n**8) Hometown Cha Cha Cha** \\- This feels like a routine KDrama that\u2019s elevated by solid acting and a lovely atmosphere. There are no spare people here, each has a background and a story to tell. Special shout out to Chief Hong and his unconventional process. Dude would make a great best friend. \n\n**9) Something in the Rain** \\- My first KDrama, my gateway drug to a fresh and exciting world I didn\u2019t know existed. You had many problems, but Son Ye-jin and Jung Hae-in were not among them. This was one of the greatest portrayals of falling in love I have ever seen. &gt;!That covert hand grab under the table when drinking among your peers; the desperate courage that took. !&lt;That\u2019s love. \n\n**10) Memories of the Alhambra** \\- Weird, bold and interesting. Hyun Bin is great, and as long as you don\u2019t focus on the technical absurdities - which the writer clearly didn\u2019t care about or explain - it\u2019s a pretty wild romp through Granada.",

The drama can\u2019t go on for too long to the point where I lose interest, but not too short that the story or relationships are underdeveloped. There also needs to be a satisfying ending! I hate being left hanging!\n\nFor this year, my number one is:\n1. Crash Course in Romance (the actors were so iconic\u2026 trying to get my bf to dress like Choi Chi yeol) \n\nOtherwise, my other favorites are:\n\n2. Heavenly Idol (on-going\u2026 \u2665\ufe0f Kim Min-kyu)\n\n3. Business Proposal \n\n4. Goblin (obvious reasons)\n\n5. Tale of the Nine Tailed\n\n6. Chicago Typewriter\n\n7. Hometown Cha Cha Cha\n\n8. It\u2019s Okay to Not be Okay\n\n9. Strongest Delivery Man\n\n10. Start Up\n\nSpecial mentions are: Vincenzo, The Bride of Habaek, and Crash Landing on You",

As I have said before, it really touched me and made me reflect on my own life choices (11/10).\n\n2. Our beloved summer\u2026 A warm tea on a cozy rainy day. Again beautiful cinematography and realistic performances. At times I felt I was watching an actual documentary.\n\n3. Reborn rich\u2026 I am all for revenge and fighting the injustice in the system, and yes I liked the ending \ud83d\ude05. Lee Sung-min is on a different level as the grandfather. Also loved the 90s pop vibes of Gravity.\n\n4. Gaus Electronics\u2026 I think I have never laughed as much with a tv series. But I guess \u201cit\u2019s my bias\u201d \ud83d\ude09\n\n5. Her private life ( minus the last 3 episodes)\u2026 for presenting the dichotomy of being a fangirl and a functioning adult in a very funny way. Also amazing chemistry between the leads.\n\n6. My liberation notes\u2026 for giving the spotlight to the introverts in the office. Also interesting portrait of adult family relations. Does anyone else zoom out on your long commute?\n\nEspecial mention: Coffee prince\u2026 it was definitely ahead of its time. Gong Yoo delivers (in my opinion) one of the best performances I have seen in a drama. Without saying a word, we as a spectators feel the struggle and then later coming to term with his feelings.",

In fact, while there are romantic dramas that I enjoy, it is very rare when I get invested in the love story itself. However, I decided to challenge myself and come up with my top 10 k-dramas (and k-movies) where I was sincerely rooting for the couple to end up together: \n\n1. Crash Landing on You\n2. Dali and the Cocky Prince\n3. I'm Not a Robot\n4. Happiness\n5. Always (k-movie)\n6. Vincenzo\n7. Flower of Evil (&gt;!I was rooting for the ML not to be evil, so they can stay together!&lt;)\n8. Gaus Electronics \n9. Mad for Each Other\n10. Bossam: Steal the Fate\n\n\nI am curious. What are such k-dramas for other people. And I am not talking about couples with likable or hot characters or even couples with good chemistry, but couples that sell you on the idea that they would be better together than apart and get you emotionally invested in it.",

He is just more stable emotionally.\n\nThat is dichotomy of fictional couples. We tend to like seeing things that look good on screen, but they do not necessarily feel good in real life. That is why some scenes that make the viewer's heart melt might not translate the same way into reality. And I don't mean it as a criticism, but as a simple commentary. In fact, I fall for it too.\n\nSo yeah, I see what you mean. I haven't seen the other entries on your list. I was meaning to see Healer for ages now, but it is from 2014 and I haven't had a good experience with older dramas. So, I have been constantly pushing it back.",

That scene where Han Hyo Joo was crying/sobbing desperately searching for her long lost love after realising she crossed path with him just beforehand, was just top notch acting, could feel the pain from her wailing and crying. She is the queen of pretty crying, Kwon Nara is the other actress who i think can 'pretty cry' almost as good as her.",

I think it\u2019s a phenomenal piece of writing and even though it\u2019s a complicated one to start with, it drew me into the kdrama world.  \n2. My mister - this. I sometimes listen to the song \u2018grown up\u2019s\u2019 just to feel the feels again. What a piece of art this one is. The cinematography is so cleverly done, complimenting the masterful acting combined with the melancholic OST - it sometimes felt like they were able to bring to screen the painful breath of existence. An absolute masterpiece that I grew to love even more when time passed.\n3. Reply 1988 - this one is a feel good tearjerker that makes you want to believe in humanity. Such a wholesome universe that neighborhood and its residence reside in. At first it read like a play and I was confused about the way I should be adjusting myself to properly experience it, but it sucked me in by the 2nd episode and I never wanted to leave. Thinking about these people still warms my heart.   \n4. Lovestruck in the city - a controversial one, I know, but I am absolutely in love with this show. It was so interesting and daring, so angsty and inventive that I immediately fell in love with it and would recommend to anyone. The cinematography in this one is absolutely beautiful with every frame feeling intentional and JCW managed to portray his character\u2019s confusion and heartbreak in such a realistic manner that it stuck with me.  \n5. When the weather is fine - this one is all about the peaceful melancholic vibe and beautiful visuals. This is another example of cinematography genius. It\u2019s so beautiful that the plot comes secondary to the visual art and the mains, though they are incredibly talented actors that did a great job with their roles, sometimes felt like a part of the art installment. So damn beautiful.\n6. Just between lovers (rain or shine) - this one is a romance and a healing story and I put it here not just because it was super interesting and well done, but because this was one of the best combinations of well written character and acting I\u2019ve seen by a young ML in a show\n7. 25/21 - It\u2019s a nostalgic love letter to youth and first love. A masterful story telling about friendship, growing up and everything that\u2019s beautiful along the way.\n8. Our beloved summer - Like a cool breeze on awarm summer day. This is a rather new show that captured me by the heart and didn\u2019t let go. Gosh I loved this one from the very first minute. The ML character was so untypical for a ML, so adorable and lovable that you just felt like giving him a hug. The entire atmosphere of this show and the progress of the OTP relationship managed to keep it both light and profound at the same time.\n9. Vincenzo - an over the top crazy crime show that reinvented the entire idea of what a plot twist can be (and how many of them you can expect from a show). What an explosive watch. One of the best action pieces on tv and the visuals (especially that first episode) don\u2019t disappoint. What a ride. \n10. Coffee prince - it\u2019s an older one which makes it hard for the show to make it in a top 10 list since so much changed in the world of kdrama production. Even though in some ways it looks completely dated, this show is so modern in the way it handles the relationship (aka the &gt;!alien speech!&lt;) and the watch is generally really fun. Gong Yoo is a gem and maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been that good if it weren\u2019t for him but it\u2019s a deserving show to be featured in a list of that sort.\n\nSpecial shotouts to:\n1. Bad and crazy - The action scenes alone are worth the watch and LDW is phenomenal in it. \n2. Mr. Queen - one of the best romcoms I\u2019ve seen. Has tons of fun watching the body swap shenanigans. \n3. Arthdal chronicles - fascinating storyline and breathtaking cinematography. \n4. Pachinko: I\u2019m never sure if this one is allowed here, but I found it incredible. \n5. It\u2019s ok to not be ok - visuals. This one is here for its inventive use of artistic aids. The way the show portrayed mental illness while using animation and other visual props blew my mind. The familial love between the brothers and the level of acting by the autistic brother were so great that it alone can merit a placing. \n 6. love play all- Love and sports and warm beautiful smiles",

            "comment": "As a huge legal drama fan, after the wealth of legal dramas that aired over the past year I revised my top ten legal list... which, sadly has barely changed. Here's hoping that this year's line-up will shake things up a bit; **Joseon Attorney** looks promising! For reference, I tend to enjoy more slice of life, realistic legal dramas rather than over-the-top courtroom thrillers with infallible genius lawyers and makjang twists.\n\n* **I Hear Your Voice**: Most legal dramas show a protagonist/antagonist view. In IHYV, there's judges, public defenders, prosecutors, defendants and victims; they all have a POV, and they're all complicated people with reasons for their choices.\n* **Diary of a Prosecutor**: The only legal drama that acknowledges 75% of law is paperwork. But beyond that, it's a dramedy that manages to both be laugh out loud funny and incredibly realistic at the same time. It also has a unique semi-rural setting.\n* **Stranger**: A true classic. The set-up is kind of extra - the implication being the only incorruptible individual is the one who literally has no emotional levers - but the story, writing and characterization are all standouts.\n* **Juror 8** (Kmovie): *Twelve Angry Men* remade as a Kmovie, and as enjoyable as the original.\n* **Juvenile Justice**: Sheds light on a area of law not usually focused on. As a Netflix series, there's some gratuitous 'look at what we can get away with without censorship rules' shock value to the cases, but the acting was excellent.\n* **The World Between Us**: This is a Tdrama, but it's a unique view of the aftermath of a mass shooting from several different vantage points: the media, the justice system, the victims and the perpetrator. \n* **Memory**: Incredibly touching mix of legal and family drama where a lawyer suffering from Alzheimer's tries to finish his final case.\n* **Solomon's Perjury**: Interesting premise where high school students take the law into their own hands after being ignored by the administration and hold a trial investigating the death of one of their classmates.\n* **The Good Wife**: Kdrama remake that manages to condense all the pertinent points and give the characters better closure. \n* **Miss Hammurabi**: The only one on the list written by a legal professional, and it shows. \n\nFormerly on the list: **Devil Judge**, which got knocked out of the running by **Juvenile Justice**. Interestingly, it was written by the same screenwriter as **Miss Hammurabi**, though aside from dealing with judges they couldn't be more different.",

Not just because they're some of the best (that I've watched), but because they showcase some of the range and style that K-drama offers, which is why they're a good introduction - without having to wade through poorly-designed, shot, acted, written or produced shows to find the gems and get this understanding.\n\nThe order is what I think would work well for breathing space between emotionally-heavy shows and with style changes that work well.\n\nOf course, if a person's into mystery, scares, revenge, and so on, this list won't satisfy them.",

Both show people that we think of as mentally disabled, who are in fact highly capable and brilliant.\n\nIn addition:\n\n**Radiant** (or whatever they are calling it now) - really grabs you when you finally figure out that it's not a fantasy romcom but rather something quite different.  \n**Dear My Friends** \\- great look at a group of friends as they deal with aging.\n\n**The Reply Series** \\- all of them are well worth watching for the camaraderie, even the one where the producers screwed up the guessing game.  \n**Hospital Playlist** \\- both I &amp; 2.

I am not a fan of Hollywood rom-coms and never watch them. My first Korean rom-com was **Romance is a Bonus Book** which I loved and that opened me up to whole new world of Korean dramas\n\n**10/10**\n\n1) A Secret Love Affair\n\n2) Kingdom\n\n3) Stranger\n\n4) Squid Game\n\n5) Beyond Evil\n\n**9.5/10**\n\n6) Sweet Home\n\n7) The Light in Your Eyes\n\n8) Our Blues\n\n9) Mouse\n\n10) Signal\n\nSpecial mention to **Crash Course in Romance**, while the writing wasn't as tight as the above-mentioned dramas, I loved the characters and how the blend of murder, romance, family and friendships all related to the flaws of the education system. It's a 10/10 for me for re-watchability.",

But personally, I really enjoyed Reborn Rich for the dynamics, especially within the chaebol family + its time-tinkering concept. I love anything history &amp; time-related. I also loved the unexpected chemistry between the main character and another central character.\n\nThe show ending was satisfying enough to me, but I do fancy the webtoon one a bit more. Regardless, I recommend it if you like \u201cchaotic but calculated high society\u201d stuff.\n\nI was planning to watch Extracurricular so thanks for the reminder!\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that a central theme of Reborn Rich is revenge, and I really like revenge shows (The Glory, Weak Hero Class 1, My Name) lol.",

I was never bored watching the story unfold. It was a really good tv show\u2026 but\u2026  I only have one problem with it\u2026 The ending. I cried so much!\n\n||Legend of the blue sea|| - This one is just pretty sweet. It\u2019s a really good starter drama. It\u2019s a classic! Watch itt\n\n||Its okay to not be okay|| - SO GOOD! I\u2019m a big fan of angst so this was the one. Of course I only like angst if it has a happy ending lol. I like how original it is iykwim. It\u2019s different from other k-dramas :)\n\n||Extraordinary you|| - Aw there\u2019s so much to say\u2026 Their relationship in this series is literally the most adorable thing. Also the detail and work they put into this show is actually crazy\n\n||True beauty|| - Okay. We all know this is a classic, so it explains itself. If you haven\u2019t watched it, You definitely should watch it rn! You won't regret it :)\n\n||Happiness|| - I also liked this one because it was original. This one is kind of like a Zombie apocalypse kind of thing. So I loved that for sure. If you like.. Zombies? This is the one for you haha. (It does have other things in it. Romance, Comedy, Angst\u2026)\n\n||My roommate is a gumiho|| - I just finished watching this one! I loved it omgThe FL and ML are so cute together! I literally can\u2019t\u2026 This has really good \u201cFluff\u201d so  I recommend this drama for sure. It\u2019s a must-watch!\n\n||W: two worlds apart|| - I feel like most people have seen this. But if you haven\u2019t you should watch it lol. It\u2019s on VIKI free with ads. Please watch it :) Actually I\u2019m still obsessed with it haha. I have a bunch of W fanart in my camera roll.\n\n||Weightlifting fairy kim-bok joo|| - This is like a coming of age drama. It\u2019s a love story about two collage athletes falling in love. This has the best \u201cFluff\u201d also the ML isn\u2019t cold or toxic. (Unlike most dramas..)\n\n||Her private life|| - This one was cute. I almost related to the FL.. Lol the kpop stuff\u2026 ha that\u2019s not the point. Anyways, the ML in this one isn\u2019t so toxic. He actually cares about the FL so much :) It\u2019s a great thing to binge watch.\n\n(I know most of these are just the classics haha but i really love them. Will not lie, I\u2019m emotionally atttached to some of them lol)\n\nEdit: These aren\u2019t in particular order. I love \u2018\u2018em all equally",

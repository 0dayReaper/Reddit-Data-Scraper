    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*!

They clarify things that had previously been opaque, but it goes far beyond expressing what others similarly felt. They make you think about points that you hadn\u2019t considered before, but it goes far beyond the revelation of plot points. \n\nNo, what impresses me the most about these reviews is the depth of insight they contain into the subtleties or nuances of a drama that a viewer like myself may have been entirely unaware of. Such subtleties and nuances include those relating to language use in social interactions, the significance of characters\u2019 body language, overarching themes in the broader social context in which the drama operates, etc.",

Its my first So Ji Sub show. Now at the halfway mark; its light and easy. The MC (both performance and character-wise) are keeping my interest. I like that the FL's character has remained consistent(at least so far), and as usual the side characters (ie the KIS!) are more fun. The romance/chemistry seems lacking but I am not too bothered by it as I like the leads separately.",

I don't think we were supposed to think &gt;!she was just playing with him the whole time, but the voiceover where she confesses she thought she would forget about him when she went back home just floored me. It would be one thing if she said she had been lying to herself, because I love a good 'character represses their feelings/character lies to themselves about their feelings' plot, but no, she thought she would forget him. And sure, she thinks she was a fool to think that, and they get back together, but I had so much trouble reconciling the relationship in the previous episodes with the idea that she thought she could forget him. It was just one line, but it really undercut the romance for me.!&lt;",

The pacing is perfect for a crime comedy show and unless something goes wrong in the last half, I think it's a solid show. \n\nHalf of the main cast is already from **Hwayugi**, which bad CGI aside, was actually a pretty fun watch. Then since it's an older show, you've got so many fun cameos! Eps 2-3 has baby faced *Heo Sung Tae* and Ep 4 has *Choi Woo-shik*. At this point I'm expecting *Kwak Dong-yeon* to make an appearance lol. \n\nIt's just so cool to see these actors before they got their big break. They were slowly climbing up the role ladder to get to where they are today, and even in these small roles, you can see the passion they have. \n\nWhat other fun moments have you guys had when you were watching a show and you spotted a now famous actor?",

It's been a long time since I watched it, so I totally forgot he was in it until I saw a picture from it last week. Kind of off topic, but has anyone else watched \ud638\uad6c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub791 (Fool's Love/HoGu's Love/HoGoo's Love)? Choi Woo Sik is the male lead in that one, and even though it's super good, it doesn't seem to be very well known. I watched it back when it was airing and have had it on my list of dramas to rewatch for a while now. It was licensed on DramaFever when it aired though\ud83d\ude22...I wonder where it is now.",

I think (edit: modern - I haven't watched a lot of the classics) kdramas are usually pretty good at adhering to many of the principles. Some examples are: not glorifying the individual who dies by suicide; showing that their decision arose from a complex situation worsened by depression, substance abuse, personality disorder, or other mental health issues (most people who die by suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis, often untreated or inadequately treated); not presenting suicide as a constructive solution to problems (there is often a focus on the lasting harm done to family, friends, and/or bystanders); not presenting the suicide in a sensationalized way or with details as to the methods (we often see just enough to tell us what happened - a pair of shoes on a rooftop railing, &gt;!the character's feet dangling above the floor!&lt;); and providing information about where to seek help either within the story or as a public service announcement at the end of the episode.\n\nHere's one resource for media professionals on preventing suicide , published by the WHO in 2017 in a variety of languages: [https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/258814](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/258814)",

And not significantly effective in deterring people from committing suicide.\n\nOf course, there are shows that go overboard, but personally, in my kdrama watching I can't think of a kdrama that glorifies suicide (tho I did pass up on Tomorrow because I don't trust Netflix with this topic).\n\nI would like to say something about drowning specifically (since that's the one you are referencing), but unfortunately, I personally never found it to be an appealing method. I tried to look for some statistics because it seemed logical to me that anyone in the planning stage would discard this method as well, but all I found is that the majority of drowning deaths are accidental, and suicide by drowning is a rare phenomenon in non-coastal regions.",

I enjoy reading your comments, in part because I feel like we come at the world from different angles. I also find you to be good at the give-and-take of respectful discussion.\n\nThe binary up- and down-vote seems completely inadequate to me for such a complex and emotionally-charged topic.  It removes all nuance from someone's reaction. A down-vote for your comment before you tagged it (as a reaction to a trigger, I mean) is so different from a down-vote due to disagreeing with something you said.  I think a lot of people shy away from the harder conversations, and fall back on the voting as a short-hand for their thoughts -- which effectively distills all their various reactions into one big negative.  And what are you supposed to learn from a big, clunky, unnuanced NO? Never to mention the topic again?  Whereas, if someone could summon up the courage to discuss their thoughts it gives us all a chance to learn. It is, as you said, short-sighted. But I also feel like people are conditioned not to think beyond clicking that button.",

This question itself is an example!  From what I've seen, when you discuss dramas you are very active and questioning, and seem to drill well down into details. To me, it comes across as very rational and research-oriented. When I wrote this, I was thinking about how much scientific and statistical knowledge you've shared -- everything from statistics on women and marriage to articles on the effects of types of food on health (I have a vague memory of this, but not the time to search for it. I believe it was pertaining to lactose among other things. If this wasn't you, I'm sorry!). Another example is the way that you synthesized current events in Turkey with the Binge discussion pertaining to the building collapse.\n\nI studied literature and went to work in the book field, so I tend to think more about drama structure, character motivation, and artsy things. If it's a cultural question or something based in reality, I'm generally thinking more narratively than statistically, if that makes sense. For example: Why is food such an integral part of Korean culture's understanding of well-being? All humans need food to survive, but not all cultures give it such central importance.  Koreans encourage each other to eat delicious food, feed each other, and just generally show their care and concern through food. Maybe this could be answered with statistics and historical facts, but I'm more likely to respond to a story about it with characters I can empathize with, like **Jewel in the Palace**. (That being said, I've really come to love narrative nonfiction that combines science and statistics with stories that illustrate them.)\n\nThis short essay is basically me saying I feel like I see the world through a literary lens and I have gathered that you see the world through a more practical (possibly science-based lens). This being the internet, it's quite possible that I've got completely the wrong impression of you. \ud83d\ude01 Regardless, thanks to you I've read several interesting articles I never would have searched out on my own.",

The impact of news reporting is best understood and guidelines have been developed. It isn't clear how similar fictional media is regarding impact on the public, but it makes sense to consider the spirit of the guidelines while remaining true to the story.\n\nThe WHO in its 2017 booklet  on preventing suicide for media professionals says not to explicitly describe the method used. A detailed description may increase the likelihood that a vulnerable person will copy the act. Also, reporting a rare and unusual method may trigger other people to use this method (p16). It is recommended not to promote specific locations as suicide sites (there's a bridge in Seoul that maybe shouldn't be shown so often in dramas) (p17). Reporting should avoid photos or video footage of scenes. \"Research shows that pictures associated with suicidal acts can be reactivated by vulnerable readers later, such as during a personal crisis, and may then trigger suicidal behavior\"(p17). \n\nThere are also a variety of myths regarding suicidal behavior which should not be promoted,(edited to add) such as that it's bad to talk about suicide, that people who talk about suicide don't mean to do it, that someone who is suicidal is determined to die, that suicide is an appropriate way to deal with certain situations, and more (p27).

Statistically. \n\nMr Queen, Black Knight, Alchemy of Souls are those I can think of right now that has this beautiful drowning scene. (Although in all three &gt;!they didn't actually die!&lt;. Maybe that is why they could show it? But then they could have shown the pain and then the &gt;!survival!&lt;.)",

The dramas makes it seem so easy and without pain.\n\nI am sorry I don't understand this trigger warning system, I am too old to manage to learn when and how to use it. Shall I put it all behind spoiler tags? \n\nOther than that: Of course the message of hope and so on is important. And for other people around to know about the signs. Even though most of the suicides in Norway are already involved with the psychiatric profession, so even for the professionals it is difficult to know what someone has planned.",

Things like suicides, sexual assaults, or any sort of violence basically. It's just giving a heads up for those who don't want to see it to move on and skip the topic. Sort of like the disclaimers you see before the start of drama.\n\nPeople generally don't like to discuss death, especially self-inflicted ones. Or some may just want to move on and don't want to be reminded of their darker past. So don't think too much about your downvotes. I understand it may seem like people are dismissing your thoughts when you are just asking a question. But it looks like you still get a good discussion out of it, which I'm guessing was your intention in the first place. \n\nOn a slightly related note, have you noticed people in dramas who are about to jump off the roof to kill themselves would sometimes take off their shoes? What's up with that? I can understand if you take off your shoes to jump into the water, but from the roof? Do they want to welcome the afterlife with clean feet or something?",

This too, last time I saw it on screen, the person sort of &gt;!fell backwards in a very romantic way, and without any screaming. Don't know if people would scream?!&lt;",

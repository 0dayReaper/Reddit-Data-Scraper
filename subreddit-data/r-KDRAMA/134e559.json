It made me realize something: if you're looking for a good romance story, you should watch an ensemble piece, not just a dedicated romance drama. **Gaus Electronics, My Unfamiliar Family, MFIS, Age of Youth** etc have better romance arcs than most of the romance dramas out there. As the writer has to give equal importance to all the characters, the romantic arcs don't get muddled with unnecessary conflicts and drama.",

Yes, this is about aliens and cults but the highlight really is the relationship between the two leads.  Jeon Yeo Been and Nana are absolutely killing it in their roles.\n\nWhen I finish this I am overdue for something more realistic (I've seen too many fantasy dramas in a row - W, The King Eternal Monarch, Tale of the Nine-Tailed and then this).  Thinking of starting **Still 17**.  I'm also looking for a show that's at least 10 years old, so suggestions welcome!",

[**Protect the Boss**](https://mydramalist.com/2658-protect-the-boss) is also a real fun non-fantasy rom-com with chaebol with trauma and candy-like female lead. I wouldn't exactly call it realistic, though. \n\nAnother great one is [**City Hall**](https://mydramalist.com/251-city-hall) about beauty contests, bullying among adults (pretty mild) and politics, with lots of snappy comments, and a fabulously eccentric female lead. Also rom-com.",

Like yes maybe shows are addressing issues that need to be addressed these days but it is so refreshing to just be entertained by the ridiculous drama!

The manga was praised for the great and accurate knowledge of wine. Anyway, interesting part: the two protagonists or main characters, one is the daughter and the other the guy's best student, are competing to see who gets the inheritance. So they need to find the 'Twelve Apostles\" which are wines and the last one is the \"Drops of God\". \n\nA detail about the story is that FL and ML don't drink alcohol. In the manga i believe, ML does.\n\nIt is so interesting, i'm loving it, this is not a spoiler cause it's part of the premise: on the first episode they were given the first wine. They are just given a tiny sample in a glass, they can smell it and look at the colour and taste it and then given a month, yes a month...a whole month, to find what wine that is..the name, the year, who made it etc...they cannot look at it anymore....it is very interesting",

It\u2019s an expensive production so the cinematography is awesome. I saw the other one and I think the Japanese live action is closer to the manga than the Apple version. I haven\u2019t watched the Japanese one, I\u2019m checking later but I think the manga is better than both adaptations.\n\nThey say there will be a movie too. So I\u2019m looking forward to that too. When I have more time I\u2019ll read the manga. \n\nI just saw this [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUST29578320070604) saying people in China and Korea started buying the wines that are mentioned in the series due to popularity \n\n&gt; \u201cThe minute it was translated into Korean, we had calls from three importers,\u201d said Basaline Granger Despagne, whose family has grown wine near France\u2019s Dordogne river for 250 years.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it was translated into Chinese, people called us from Taiwan saying, \u2018I bought some Mont Perat and sold 50 cases in two days because of the manga\u2019,\u201d she said in a phone interview.",

Thought they were just redoing the drama again with different leads, though an interesting casting choice with Yamapi. \n\nI have seen the older Japanese version when it came out, the one with Kame as lead. Like you said, it felt like a low budget production. I'm surprised to see on wikipedia that it won some awards as well. Personally, I'd say skip the older drama and just read the manga. I only read a few chapters of the manga way back then, and it was definitely better than the older drama. \n\nThis new adaptation definitely looks more interesting though. And lol, that article you linked was just ridiculous. People really buy into hypes that easily.",

So it was a good idea to have canceled that. \n\nI was watching the 3rd episode and some of those wines cost EUR$ 12,000.00 which is over USD$ 13,000.00 so it is very expensive to acquire them and show them.

Then watching dramas, the ads come on at specific time intervals regardless of what is happening in the plot, so you are in the middle of a scene and it cuts abruptly.

I think there are scenes that are wayy too long (like that first \"finger flicking\" scene), and there are definitely plots within the show that are dragged out (my siblings are asking me when he will finally get the gold in the building, and we're on episode 8).\n\nI think Vincenzo could've been better with the usual 16-episode route, rather than 20 episodes. That way you wouldn't have so many fillers and dragged-out scenes and plots. Overall I still enjoyed the show, but will admit that I lost a little bit of interest once the Babel boss stopped interacting with the other characters &gt;!(i.e. Chayoung; it felt like he became a more one-dimensional villain once he gave up the fluffy side.)!&lt;",

            "comment": "So my streak of picking kdramas at random culminated in my finding another really enjoyable binge, **Born Again** (2020, 32 eps), starring **Lee Soo-hyuk, Jin Se-yeon,** and **Jang Ki-yong**. It's a love triangle of fated mates and past lives, with serial killers and revenge and a lot to say about deconstructing the nature of revenge and our desire for it. \n\nI purposely didn't read any spoilers about this and, when I finished and checked past threads, I understood why other redditors were wondering what my conclusions might be (since we all know you can't see something for the first time twice!), so the below is my reaction to what turned out to be a pretty controversial kdrama!\n\nContext about where my review is coming from:  I am a hopeless romantic and a Pisces; the idea of rebirth and resurrection and red strings and lovers finding each other across the ages is one of my favorites, and not just because you get to see so many different and bad period hairstyles. The MLs are two of my all-time favorite actors, and while the FL seemed super familiar to me, I must've just seen her in cameos because I looked at her catalogue lol. Anyway, I say this to let you know that I'm going to be much more charitable than some viewers due to my liking the OT3 so much.\n\n**Why No Summary.** I type really fast and I started writing a summary and it got soooo long I won't be able to fit this into the character limit so only read the below if you've either already seen the drama and want to see my thoughts on it, or if you don't plan to watch it and want to see the connections I saw between this drama and others!\n\n**Revenge is For Animals.** So leaving the romantic part of the plot aside, I thought BA did such a good job of subverting the common revenge trope: X wronged me and mine, therefore I will cause X to suffer and/or die. I've never really liked that and the reason why, in my case, is Captain Kirk. It's all Captain Kirk's fault.\n\nI am older and thus was constantly watching the original **Star Trek** series in reruns while I was young (my mom watched it while it aired when she was in college and has been a Trekkie ever since; she still watches ST:TNG reruns while she's ironing the laundry). In one episode, Captain Kirk gets captured and forced to fight slaves (thralls) in an arena because duh. Rather than obey the thumbs down to kill his defeated opponent, Kirk throws his weapon away and is ready to sacrifice himself rather than his morals (should I have spoiler tagged that? it aired in the 60s, man!).\n\nCaptain Kirk (and Jesus) taught me at a young, impressionable age that the sign of a true hero is a refusal to compromise your moral code just to save your life. This lead me to ponder the differences between revenge and justice: if you're seeking to inflict pain because pain was inflicted on you, that's revenge; if you're seeking for someone who's wronged you to be forced to admit their wrongdoing, and that admission carries with it consequences, that's justice. (I'm simplifying it but that's my premise.)\n\nBA confronts this in multiple scenes, but I'm thinking of a couple in particular. &gt;!In the present day timeline, Prosecutor Kim Soo-Hyeok (Lee Soo-hyuk) fights Seo Tae-Ha (Choi Dae-chul) after Tae-ha has lured him to a private location to exact vengeance from Soo-hyeok because he caused Tae-ha's brother's death. They fight. When Cheon Jung-beom (Jang Ki-yong) stops them and tells them the best revenge is making them live with the consequences of their actions, Prosecutor Kim apologizes. He admits his wrongdoing and indeed, later he works with Tae-ha to clear his brother's name and make up for his other wrongdoings. Rather than avoid the consequences of his actions, he resigns and starts working toward making amends.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Most other dramas would have no problem if it went a different way; if Tae-ha had killed Prosecutor Kim and avenged his brother, it would be shrugged off. Spoilers for Vincenzo: That's essentially the ending of Vincenzo, e.g., Vincenzo rigs convincing torturous deaths for the main villains, and then sails off to his private island. Both the OTP are lawyers, but murder was the best solution? By that point in the drama, I was emotionally checked out because I could see where it was going. Not to mention that it was pretty clear the main villain had serious mental health problems and so seemed to have no way of processing his own actions, so watching him be tortured to death didn't have any sense of satisfaction for me, personally. It felt gross and I don't think Captain Kirk would have approved.!&lt;\n\nSoooo many other themes I could seriously talk all day about the imagery, the acting, the humor, and the romance, but I don't want this to be too long so here's a couple other things:\n\n* Lee Soo-hyok is like they designed an android just to be the perfect ML (these are personal opinions, lol), but in both timelines, his ML is *seriously* flawed. He recognizes this and makes amends. *He apologizes for stuff.* So refreshing.\n* Jang Ki-yong does an amazing job of changing his whole mannerism in relation to the characters, whether he's playing the abused feral boy Ji-cheol or the emotionless Cheon Jong-beom, even the way he walks and looks changes. Actors do dual roles a lot, but this is next level, especially after &gt;!the two characters are melded.!&lt;\n* &gt;!They should make a spin-off with Park Sang-hoon's murder tween. Baby-faced psychopaths are fun.!&lt;\n* The constant making fun of LSH's characters for never aging and for always acting as a lone wolf, especially from Detective Joo In-do (Jang Won-young), are hilarious. \"There he goes again, off alone!\" \"How do you keep that face, do you moisturize?\" Combined with constant jokes about how hot the MLs are made me laugh out loud a couple times.\n* **The KISSING**. It's from 2020; there is *no excuse* for having two of finest actors working today and having their skinship be so poor. How am I supposed to like a guy who is amazingly romantic when he's giving a piggyback ride and as soon as his lips touch the FL's he looks like a statue whose arms fell off. My guy, take a step closer, I swear your groins won't touch.\n* **The ENDING**. Look, I liked the ending of **LOST** back in the day, so I prefer endings with satisfying emotional conclusions rather than requiring neatly tied-up plots. With that said, different people can watch the ending and interpret it in completely different ways, so this is just mine:  &gt;!I think Sa-bin cared for Jong-beom until he died from the moving bullet, and the subsequent scene at the bookstore was part of his end-of-life montage. He even told the Priest while he was burying the baby that he doesn't believe in an afterlife but thinks we see all our happy moments with our loved ones while we're dying. Ji-cheol always wanted to be inside the bookstore rather than outside; he was jealous of Hyeong-bin, and in his dying moments, he got his wish. While I don't think Sa-bin ended up together with Soo-hyeok, they have a whole future to get back together if they want. It's okay to take a break.!&lt;\n\nThanks! I really liked that and I might have to watch it again for more thoughts. I did wish they gave some of the subplots more emphasis and others less, but those are nitpicks. I kind of want to have a company dinner where we eat tripe and drink soju and talk about all the other dramas this one both borrows from and subverts. I want to write a PhD thesis on this, not because it's perfect, but because it's thought-provoking!",

And the hard part is that then you have no one to gush about the drama withhhh :) :)\n\nI've been SO obsessed with **Queen for 7 Days** for the past... almost 2 weeks now??? ;) I think I'm on my (not even going to say I\u2019m embarrassed #) rewatch.\n\n**Is there anyone here i can gush with about this drama???**\n\n\\- -\n\nWhich brings me to 2:\n\nI'm sure there are themed topics about this on this reddit, but I have missed them as of late.\n\n**Who are your favorite sageuk lady characters???**\n\nUp until rewatching Queen for 7 Days, I probably would have said Kwon Yuri's Yi Su Kyeong from Bossam.\n\nBut I think Park Min Young's Cha Gyoung in Queen for 7 Days equals and maybe rivals that.\n\nI'm SO impressed with this drama - the writing in particular- and then how the leads brought these characters to life.\n\nPark Min Young did the impossible with that role - she made a socially/ politically constrained innocent and naive character have SO much personality and depth of character. I was so impressed by the way she managed to so believably flip flop between being happy and being devastated and keep both acts so \"on tone\". \\[there's a few exceptions to this- but I chalk it up to very few dramas can \"do it all\"- either they do amazing set up and can't deliver or they do a really heavy hitting set up but then WOW do they develop and deliver once the set up is established. Choi Jin Young is definitely the latter. Hits you with a hammer with some intensely contrived initial scenes and set ups just to get the story going but then once it's going it's sooo delicatteeeee\\]\n\nThat each of the leads is just a tiny part of political machinations that are WAY beyond them but then each still so beautifully insist on THEIR choices dictating their lives was so beatifully written and delivered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway. :) Love to hear your favorite sageuk women :) ***and why : )***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- -\n\nAnd 3\n\nTime for a round of \"**best kdrama soundtracks\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLezzz go!!!\n\n1. Best soundtrack ( who was the composer)\n2. Your favorite track if you have one\n3. and why if you have a reason\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will keep on the theme of my **Queen for 7 Days** gush - but that soundtrack composed primarily by **Lee Pil Ho and Park Jong Mi** has some GREAT tracks. I don't know if I'd say the soundtrack as a whole ranks in my top.\n\n[ It's titular track is stunning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ-9lTMS-fM&amp;list=PLdYr2WcO7Gi8dPKJAJivIU51M0gSkzqw2)\n\nI find it so perfect for the drama because it has the piano riff that so strongly expresses innocent love and it's fighting the whole song through to not get drowned out by chords and symphonic interludes that either speak to the mysteries of some parts of the plot or the \"forces and fates\" that are not in their favor.\n\nAlso it friggin uses handpan / hang drums which gets a large amount of bonus points. :)\n\nThere are a few other tracks to the soundtrack that I have favorited as well. :)\n\n**Jung Se Rin et al's work on the soundtrack for Time** remains #1 for me.\n\nI've gone months where all I've listened to is that soundtrack.\n\nI think the thing that blew my mind about that soundtrack originally was how poetically *titled* the tracks were and how thematically on point and intentional each track was for when it was first played in the drama.\n\nThat this track is titled [\"The Moment I Decided to Live\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sprD-Wqiz0I) MATTERSSSSS and adds that CHEF'S KISS for understanding and interpreting the scene where it's first played in the drama. \n\nThe soundtrack goes through so many emotions but I loved how it offered through its tracks a time to reflect on a thought and mood and then provided each with a chance at transcendance. Like here with \"[Regret for Wasted Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lh-buaa2ik)\". I mean WHAT a title but also WHAT a journey that track leads you through when thinking about it!\n\nAlso the songs to represent love are just SO FRIGGIN GENTLE AND KILL ME. That this is titled, \"[I Went To See You\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mGKcLPrH84) just pulls at my heart forever and always. What a tender way to describe *how* we love.",

Despite that though I cannot help but play the drama on 1.5x or 2x speed.\n\nI'm also watching the glory and the difference in how I treat these dramas is fascinating to me. Usually I watch things while I eat but since the glory is so good and gives me loads of goosebumps I want to be fully immersed and don't allow myself to watch while eating. \n\nBut for the real has come I'm eating and fastforwarding and it feels fine. If I did that to the glory my experience would be ruined. But my experience with TRHC is not ruined by these distracting actions. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like the real has come has bad pacing sometimes. Or that you want to fastforward through scenes with characters you don't care about. Like I don't give a shit about jang se jin or her mom. I also don't care about the oldest brother that wants to be ceo or the fls younger brother and Mls sister love story (although that may change)",

            "comment": "Could someone explain the final of **Summer Strike** to me, please?\n\n&gt;!I honestly don't understand the realtor's motive. In episode 1 he was helping the FL to find an apartment, but after he found a house for her, he suddenly wanted to kill her????? I feel like I missed something. It seems out of place and doesn't make any reasonable sense to me. I understand the subplot about his son accidentally killing the ML's sister, but why target FL? Why did they want to kill FL? For what? What's the motive, I just don't get it. She didn't know anything, she didn't do anything wrong, she's just a random and the realtor himself brought her to the house. Was it just so he could buy the house at a lower price due to a death occurring there or something? That's some crazy stuff.!&lt;\n\nNevertheless, I really enjoyed the show and want to watch more stuff like it. It felt so good a lot of times. The whole character dynamic and setting. It was something that hooked me from the start after some kdrama idleness. Really appreciate how characters felt authentic and relatable, without a lot of romcom tropes, or too much glamour or artificiality. Not sure how to characterize such a show, maybe some \\`chill quiet introvert energy\\`?\n\nWould be happy to hear more recommendations similar to this one. My favorite shows:  \nReply 1988, Our Blues, My Liberation Notes, Go Ahead",

It is about FL who got burned out at work in Seoul and decided to start a new life by moving to seaside village.\n\nThere is a bit of a mystery subplot, similar to \"When camellia blooms\" if you have seen it (which got me confused in the final).

Think of the most crazy, quirky character, and that's Hwang Bo-ra.\n\nI'm only on episode 1 of Kiss Sixth Sense, but I just got to the scene where they are setting up a commercial shoot for a mattress. Her character, in front of a room full of people whom she just ignores completely, says and does the most outrageous things while talking to her coworker/friend about her friend's lack of a sex life. I blushed, slapped both my hands over my face in embarrassment, and then almost immediately had to throw my head back and just let loose with loud laughter. It was just so crazy and funny, absolutely insane.",

    "postText": "Ever watch a drama where by the time the ending credits roll for the final episode, you start wishing you can get a refund for your time spent? \n\nIf so, come to this thread to [lament](https://i.redd.it/cjahtu0e77z41.gif) about that drama you wish [you'd never watched](https://i.redd.it/y79jjzsnygg31.gif)!\n\nThis post is different from the *Dramas I Have Dropped* post in that these should be dramas you finished watching and then regretted watching as opposed to having dropped the drama midway. Colloquially referred to as *hate watch*. This thread is envisioned for both the completists in our community who cannot drop dramas and dramas that go off the rails at the last minute.\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they regretted watching certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all. We can learn from each other and maybe even be convinced by others as to why a drama may have been worth watching after all.\n\nYou are not limited to Kdramas, feel free to discuss non-Kdramas or movies too. We strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

And it's not because of the losing weight, or body shaming parts of the show like you might expect. I actually really appreciated how the ML solely focused on her losing weight for her health. He said multiple times that the outside didn't matter, but he wanted her insides to be healthy so she could live a long life. I appreciate it that part a lot. What made me so mad was how the FL turned out to be such a useless character who didn't even do anything! At the beginning she seems like she's going to be this feisty, strong-willed, and competent person. But by the end of the show she's nothing but a crying mess who doesn't ever actually even do anything! We never get to see her be a strong lawyer who's winning cases, all she ever does is cry beside the ML side, she never helps him with any of his problems. In fact when he's going through the hardest time of his life and he tells her to leave, she just listens! She cries and says like okay I'll be waiting for you over here. At that point she should have said no, I'm going to stay by your side, we're going to get through this together. I'll be the pillar of strength that you can lean on when times are tough. Instead she just cries and waits around for him to decide to come to her. It drove me crazy how weak and ineffective at everything she was by the end of the show. It made me so mad, in case you couldn't tell hahaha.",

Knowing that never changed in the end either is definitely disappointing. \n\nFor me it was the fat phobia, the empty shell of a ML and that ridiculous portrayal of the Korean American character. I do get the joke but they gave him nothing but all the lowest hanging, unimaginative cheap shots for lines. As someone in the diaspora myself (not Korean) it just got irritating.",

She wasn\u2019t that likeable or empathetic.  Yea she tried to portray a person going through issues about her physical self but I found her lacking compassion for others.   I didn\u2019t really like her in hometown chacha Cha even though I loved the drama. Kim Seon ho and the villagers carried that show. Shin Min ah\u2019s dimples were cute but she was a condescending elitist at the begining but at the end she wasn\u2019t too differnt.  And the character did the same thing where Kim Seonho\u2019s character is going through a crisis and her character just let him figure it out for himself.  Is that weird? Was that an acting choice or a writing choice?",

The only thing stringing them together is their childhood connection! I love a good childhood connection contrary to popular opinion but I couldn\u2019t get behind this one. This was even a 2nd chance romance which I also love but this show was a big fat no! \n\nThe last episode had so many ridiculous tropes, all I could do was blank stare. They had a &gt;!misunderstanding, disappearing without a word (attempting to), a last minute break up (literally after 20 mins of being together) \ud83d\udc80, an airport scene (where the breakup took place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), main character going abroad, a time skip, and ML comes back to beg FL after leaving her the way he did.!&lt; Mind you, all of this happened within the last 20ish minutes of the episode \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab absolutely ridiculous but I wasn\u2019t even surprised with the way the rest of the show was. And then their end dynamic is like their toxic childhood dynamic. \n\nAt max, I give this show a 2.5 for the cheap laughs and semi interesting dating show concepts. The only reason I watched this till the end was because it was airing and I\u2019m not a great dropper. I regret not dropping this during week 2 or 3 like I thought to do but we live and we learn I guess \ud83e\udee0",

There was SO much drinking, it got tiresome. It sounded like there was only 3 songs that they every really played and I got sick of hearing the same songs over and over. The mother was AWFUL and was never fully called out nor redeemed. I got tired of seeing the main couple and the I feel like their relationship didn't reach much depth. And finally, the way they wrapped up the storyline at the coffee company and the main couple felt very unsatisfactory and not that great, just meh. \n\nI also read lots of positive comments about this show and I cannot understand why there are so many.",

The show already shows you he could have if he wanted to.\n\nWhat all this stalling did was buy time for...gold digging discord, the same villains doing pretty much the same things except one of them near the end, and pretty much any action that could have meaningfully dealt a blow time to be brushed off. All on a concept of prolonging and completing revenge? It seems downright petty at best with all the leeway it gets the target to do more with their lives.\n\nThe show would have been fine with like 12 episodes of time honestly but as is too much seems like unwanted fat to trim.",

            "comment": "I believe **Summer Strike** suffered from thinking it could rely on vibes alone. Just threw in dramatics and pretty scenes cause they're popular story elements. No real character evolution. Just inconsistency and odd genre shifting. I wasn't expecting anything deep. I like no brainer kdramas too. But I also like being thoroughly entertained.\n\nFirst few episodes were good. Some scenes even made me cry. I thought it was going to be about a girl finding her true self in a miserable little town and maybe falling in love. Instead I got a murder mystery??? With a Scooby-Doo switcheroo??? The mistreatment of a mentally disabled man??? And a FL who can't decide the appropriate time to have a backbone??? All for what? The story needed tweaking.\n\nI'm willing to argue that the ML character wasn't fully fleshed out when this show got greenlit. The closer I got to the finale the more it felt like the writers were throwing hail marys to get this show over with. So when it finished,I felt nothing. I really love small town dramas (of any genre) so this was disappointing for me.\n\n**Her Private Life**? More like her meandering life. First half of this show was great. Simple, funny, cute and Kim Jae Wook looks hot as hell. I mean even my dark little soul was eating this up! But after the leads got together, we're pushed back into the slowest, most uninspiring storyline cause...the screenwriter was over it too? Idk. I actually skipped 3 episodes. Nothing. Changed. Park Min Young is fantastic in this and she deserved better. This could've been just 8 episodes and really focused on her fangirl hijinks. And the ML backstory could've been a whole lot better.",

HPL is one of my favorite dramas, but I stop at the end of ep 12, because I can't endure the last 4 episodes again. It's like a total schizofrenia. I understand that he had to come to terms with his childhood pain, but the writers did a whole 180 on the mood of the drama and turned it into a laughable soap opera.",

Like her brother could just tell them, miscommunication troupe. \n2. Vincenzo - I just couldn\u2019t continue it. So much noise and cringe scenes. I know so many love it but I couldn\u2019t keep watching it. \n3. Goblin - I know this one is classic but I got into kdramas late so not sure if it\u2019s that or the age gap doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Couldn\u2019t continue after 4 episodes \n4. Weight lifting fairy kjb- again even after 4-5 episodes I just couldn\u2019t watch it. Again favorite of so many but I didn\u2019t like it to continue it.",

            "comment": "It's hard for me to say I regret watching a show to the extent that I wish I had never watched it because I feel like I gain and learn something from every drama. But My Liberation Notes comes pretty darn close. I haven't finished it yet, but this upcoming rating isn't looking good so far... \ud83d\udc40\n\nI was really eager to watch this because I love a good slice of life drama that\u00a0isn't afraid of digging deep into real issues. But MLN is not what I expected at all. First of all, I misunderstood that the plot was about a woman who decides to live a different life in the countryside to find herself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 In reality, I find the characters' thoughts and perspectives to be highly depressing. To be fair, I'm not always looking for pick me ups, but this is rough. And soooo slowwww! Nevertheless, (not the kdrama lol) there still are some inspiring and beautiful takeaways from a few scenes that I can appreciate. Finally, down to the last 3 episodes though \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udee0\n\nProbably an unpopular opinion is my love/hate relationship with True Beauty and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. They're both super cute dramas with ADORABLE FLs, fun fashion and I thank God I was introduced to both of these MLs (yess Cha Eun Woo!\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c) But the tropes were sooo tropey, the jokes sometimes overly silly to the point of cringe, and the cliches had me rolling my eyes often lol. I can't say I regret watching them because I understand their appeal and I can at least keep up with references, but I was ready for them to be over at a certain point :(",

She had no substance and was just a stupid, giggly girl.\n\nI can't stand 'abuse' shows, the mental and physical abuse that is shown towards people in Kdramas is just so wrong, yet they keep churning them out by the dozen every single year. The world has tried to move on in displaying this kind of tripe, yet dramas like this get praised left right and centre.\n\nI wish I could get a refund and extra bonus triple credit for even burning my eyeballs with this show.",

Guess I wasn't off the mark either.\n\nSo it looks like the location of the secret club is actually the &gt;!orphanage!&lt; which explains why Je Hyeok is marrying Yoo Jung.\n\nOn that note, Yoo Jung's character is frustrating as hell because she's making insanely stupid choices in the name of 'love' which definitely comes off more as an inferiority complex than anything else. I'm thinking Yoo Jung is the &gt;!real killer 10 years ago!&lt;.\n\nNext episode can't come fast enough!",

I feel so disconnected, and no offence to Shin Eun Jung but her eyes look dead to me.",

The announcement of the relationship of Do Jae Yi and Choi Kang Hoo seems like they were hiding it before, which would make sense as some are bothered that she's with Yoo Na's former boyfriend.  \n\nBut in episode one, didn't he ask her if she'd \"like to come for ramen\" and make ramen for her?  Didn't that imply that they were having sex?  \n\nI'm only part way through ep 3 so maybe this is cleared up or am I reading too much into the Ramen thing.  (Might be as I just finished \"Matrimonial Chaos\" and there's a lot of discussion about a couple having ramen.)",

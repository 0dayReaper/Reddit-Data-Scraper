I think the action was pretty cool. Special effects were so-so. What really blew me away was the cinematography though. I have seen Jeju a million times on so many shows but this one made it seem almost ethereal. I guess that\u2019s what they were going for with Tamra and they succeeded in my books. Sung Joon was believable as a villain, KNG was swoon worthy but I feel like his talent wasn\u2019t used to it\u2019s full potential and LDH was amazing while she was building the barrier. Also props to CEW for holding his own against veterans.",

There was so much backstory, and lore they tried to cram it into 12 episodes, it slowed the pacing to a halt in places. \n\nThat last episode was the amount of action I wanted throughout. It also sort of veered out of horror into thriller/action. \n\nI think it suffered too from being split, with the wait time between the two halves I\u2019d sort of moved on so it was hard to get back into the series. \n\nIt\u2019s worth a watch but not one I\u2019ll rewatch.",

Forget what I said about Cha Eun Woo before - he was so cool. I really got into his character. &gt;!That shot of him pinned on the wall with that big sword through him! !&lt;Whoa! I was impressed. \nAnd of course KNG was STELLAR. &gt;!Intense emotional scene with Miho and Van at the end. I cried. I didn\u2019t want to see Van die but that was a great death for a tragic character.!&lt;",

            "comment": "The Cast, high scale production value  and the Characters the strongest pillars this show has, everything else besides these are preety much forgettable..\n\nThey splurged 14 million dollars in production and its clearly evident in how beautifully the whole show has been shot.. The CINEMATOGRAPHY is outlandish. I've seen Jeju being portrayed in several dramas before but none comes close to what Island did(especially the 2nd part). The CG was very mediocer in the first part but it really amped up in the 2nd one.. \nEdit- So I watched Kim Nam Gil's Lover's Vanished (a 2009 korean indie melodrama, the theme is depressing sure but the cinematography.. is gold standarded, I think even better than Island)\n\nThe CAST- \nCasting was pretty spot-on mostly \u2667 Kim-Nam-Gil who I think was born for this role. *His back must hurt carrying the weight of this whole damm show on his own*. (I said what I said) the man knows how and where to use his acting chops really well. Now that i have seen him play Van I don't think I would've liked anyone else in the role. Those subtle micro-movements of his eyes added so very much more to Van's chracter,  moments that I'm sure wasn't even written on the actual script. VAN is tortured soul, has been alive for hundreds of year carrying burden and guilt.. and it's like you can feel the weight of that burden... in how exceptionally Nam Gil performs Van. I wonder what rock I had been living under to discover an actor as great as Nam Gil this late through Island (owning to the fact that I've been a k-contet consumer for 6 years now). In the 1\u00bd month break the show took after airing its 1st half I went down the rabbit hole &amp; devoured 6 of Nam Gil's works and loved him in almost all of them.\n\n\u2667 Lee Da Hee brought out her big gun acting skills mostly in the 2nd half of part 2 but at-least for once in the past few years she played a different role that just being a *powerful-damsel-in-distress Chaebol heiress*\n\n\u2667 Cha-Eun-Woo, now this guy was the one who suprised me in a good way the character of Yohan in all due respect could have been played by any other K-pop idol actors.. but unexpected Eun Woo brought in a lot of fun and emotion to this chracter.. he still has a long way to go but his skills have definitely improved from his previous roles.\n\n\nThe CHARACTERS\n\n\u2667 Let me start with Van because this guy was my favourite in the trio . Absolutely loved the deviation they took from the webtoon in terms of writing Van's characters. In the comics he's more of a killing-machine rather that a mutated-feelingless hybrid, the decision to add human emotions of guilt and love definitely worked like a charm in fleshing out his character's depth that was missing in the comic.\nI am not saying that Van's chracter was written to perfection there was a lot of space for improvement but with whatever source material they had. They surely made the most out of it, the hint of karmic starcrossed lovers relationship between Van &amp; Miho as well as his wholesome mother-son like relationships with *halmeioni*(granny) Baek did give the emotional depth I wasn't hoping to find when starting the show..\n\n\u2667 Yohan the hippe hot talkative priest chracter is the only chracter who I felt like had the most when it comes to *chracter development*. In the beginning we were introduced to him as this bubbly cheeky young boy who exorcises demons listening to music as the episodes progress we find that he had past trauma and then in the closing shot we see him as this depressing guy who had lost the last thing he loved i.e music, as a cost of saving the world...\n\n\u2667 Miho- I really wouldn't have cared about this character at all had it not been for the final 4 episodes of the show. The chracter really pushed through in the final third act so that's okay.\n\n\nONTO THE WORST ASPECT\n\nThe most crucial element of any show that is its \n\u2664 PLOT &amp; Plot pacing.. which was a dissapoinmet when in comes to Island . Man it was all over the place except for the right location where it was supposed to be. \nNew plot elements being  added to story every now and then for furthering the plot without much explanation to support it existence, are a common occurrence in this show (adding in things only for plot-convince really turns me off, Yohan's *Blue light*-quick healing- *extreme strength inducing*-religiously granted superpowers being of of them ).\n\n\u25c7 The EDITING- Damm it was so very choppy and it got worse in the final 2 episode.. the potential of those great action scenes in the final battle were reduced to half because of the jump-cut editing\n\n\u25c7 And this one last complaint is more like a personal let down but I'm gonna say it nonetheless  . The absolutely under-utilization of Kim Nam Gil and Lee Da Hee's chemistry as Van and Miho The creators could have done such great thing with it..\nBut it escape my understanding why they didn't....\n\n\nI throughly enjoyed it it's a great one time watch and maybe even a rewatch but that is as far as it will go for me..  it had so much potential do better",

I hope you got to see Through the Darkness, he was terrific in that.  He nails dark characters really well, like Van, and also in Memoirs of a Murderer.  Then you get to see his light hearted side in Fiery Priest and Live Up to Your Name in which he gets to show his playful personality which is how he is IRL.

I was in a puddle of tears.. I still can't stop bawling over that scene.. the entire scene was really well acted both by Nam Gil as well as Lee Da Hee.. I could truly feel their palpable emotion)!&lt;\n\n\nI seriously should have decided against watching this &gt;!cry-feast at 9:30 am in the morning..!&lt;\nThe Glory and Shadow and Bone S2 is airing today but I don't think these two will be of any help to make get over this &gt;!k-traum anytime soon!&lt;",

I should have waited until now and watched everything together to keep the momentum cause this second part was kind of lame.\n\n Back story felt rushed, the character development was not good (I had so many words to describe this but I felt that it would have came across too negatively), the action scenes were so-so, the story line fell apart. \n\nI just didn't like it after it had such a great start",

Someone else said it that it feels like they made this show as if everyone already knew the story. Which Koreans might bc it's an older story. But as someone who didnt, I feel a bit like how nonBoruto watchers are like wtf why is Sasuke fighting a dinosaur?\n\nYou get the gist of the drama from the big scenes but half of the time it's a bit confusing what leads into what. Like some stuff happens then suddenly something else happens that's tangentially related but you cant quite put your finger on the direct line from point a to b, but we're here now and something else pretty cool happened so ok let's just go with it...\n\nEveryone did their jobs well on their own but there was a lack of overall cohesion.\n\nShout out to the wardrobe stylists and character design team. Van's suit fits were perfection. And angsty silver haired dudes with eye problems is the cheat code.",

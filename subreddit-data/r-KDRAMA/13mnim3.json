I dropped s1 around ep 14 or so but s2 has been a freakin' delight. Bromance, comedy, action, fine men in vintage suits, a badass mountain god FL whose fashion is as good as the fashion in Hotel Del Luna and IOTNBO, and a story that takes the events of s1 and builds on them in an organic way (forcing Lee Yeon to confront the consequences of his obsession with Ae-eum/Ji-ah is brilliant and needed). I've been in a serious drama slump so I'm thrilled that TOTNT38 is feeding me so well.",

To some extent, that's true for Kim Bum too, and it also seems KB chooses roles where there's high bromance potential (Padam Padam, That Winter the Wind Blows, TotNT). It's not like either of the actors can't do romance well per se, it's just that the romance is often not as good as the bromance, maybe because of comfort level. But if they really turn it on, I bet audiences would respond extremely positively \ud83e\udd2d.",

This was so hilarious. &gt;!LR flipping off a person while disguised as a baby is something I didn't expect to see.!&lt; \n\nI thought I was done laughing but then&gt;! the baby talked!&lt; and [dodged](https://imgur.com/a/siz8Svu) the bullet. My stomach hurt so much from laughing. \n\nRHJ is such a [badass](https://imgur.com/a/krlAQQZ) with the big sword and everything. I love how nuanced her character is. She's so unpredictable. You never know what her next action is. \n\nI'm pretty sure [RK](https://imgur.com/a/ISQxUOy) will be the ultimate villain. He just has that face. \n\nLR IS SUCH A [TSUNDERE](https://imgur.com/a/dJNtptX). I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. \n\nWas she referring to [LR](https://imgur.com/a/RhWe5jG)?\n\nTaluipa is so [petty](https://imgur.com/a/Do6Nnfu). She's that friend who will spoil everything just because. I laughed out loud because of this scene.\n\nI'm shipping [them](https://imgur.com/a/9lkoSZi) so much. I love how LR keeps on defying her expectations. Instead of being angry with JYH, LR praised her for her combat ability. She really would fit his ideal type. But I can't help but think that &gt;!JYH would die in the end. Where is JYH in the future? I know it's complicated because of time travel but their relationship isn't affected by the presence of LY. If she dies, it may help LR with his character development and create the LR that we know in the previous season.!&lt;\n\nI just love how [LY and GSJ](https://imgur.com/a/po7fQso) were tailing and being annoying brothers to LR. \n\nI can't wait for the next episode. I love to see the dynamics between the three former mountain gods. Based on the preview for the next episode, we will see the three of them [together](https://imgur.com/a/H6VAYIe). It will be hilarious for sure. \n\nI also predict that CMY will eventually side with LY and help him battle against the ultimate villain. We would see the three former mountain gods fight together.",

It's a tad out of place because Yuri had the best chemistry with Lee Rang because their relationship was familial/platonic/gratitude, and that's why RangYuri was a thing from S1. That said, the revolutionary plotline fits well with the Japanese Governor-general plotline (who seems to be the real big bad). Hopefully, they can wrap it up and tie it into the larger arc towards the end.\n\nYong Ji looks amazing tho and is a good actress based on other works I've seen. She tends to be drawn to non-mainstream type roles. Meaning I haven't seen her in any shy, sweet typical love interest roles, but I haven't watched all of her works.",

So then  history stays the same, Rang stills dies, but because Yeon technically did go back and alter things then something was created back then (with mermaid and the life debt bond??) that makes it possible for Rang to be reincarnated in the present day.  \r  \n\r  \nBut then what about that kid at the end of S1? bad: he dies and this becomes Rang's 3rd life. better: Yeon mistook the kid for Rang (he never used the Tiger's eyebrow glasses) &amp; the kid simply had looked very similar - doppelgangers.",

Season one had a spooky and interesting start plus the brothers relationship took the entire show to sort out, but in season two it takes half an episode to sort it out and it's all silly/weird rather than interesting and spooky.\n\nI don't know if I'm over Korean dramas or if they are just not good any more. I WANT to watch and love them like I used to but the last one I even liked was Business proposal and that was so long ago. I started watching Turkish dramas and so far I'm loving them. It's fun to see a new culture, hear a new language, etc. I keep wanting to come back to Korea - I've been watching Korean dramas since Full House all those years ago - but so far lately the dramas are just meh now and have been for a long while. I'm waiting for Ji Chang Wook's new drama and hoping it's good like his old stuff used to be like Healer and K2.  (minus Anna)",

I also felt NO CHEMISTRY between the leads (this is a very important aspect for me, considering the romance took up a lot of the screen time so good chemistry is vital to keep you invested). The love story took way too much of the screen time and there wasn't a good build up or any tension (they were kind of just suddenly sooo in love lol, i personally prefer slow burns and angst so I was hoping it would be more like goblin with the grim reaper and sunny when they showed their tragic past but in this show they didn't flesh it out as much as i wanted ahahah). On this note, I just noticed I usually like the second leads romances better as i feel they build it up better rather being completely in love and willing to die for each other by 2nd episode like eternal monarch and some other dramas as well. I found it very boring and i felt like the romantic scenes where out of place, for instance a certain character would be suffering or dying and the leads would be all happy and giddy on a date professing there undying love for one another lol\n\nOther dynamics were a lot more interesting like the feud between the brothers and Rang's character and his development caught my attention more, so while watching I looked forward to their scenes and preferred that they focused on the lee brothers more and they ANSWERED season 2 is a BLAST!! so enjoyable, I also feel like they have approached the romance properly this time and giving us little snippets which is nice and not overwhelming or unnatural.",

His character was just amazing and his story with his brother and also the girl fox was super interesting. And I'm the same as you that I need the leads to have chemistry for me to watch something. I didn't really think these two had great chemistry but I've seen worse so I stuck with it! But it really is best when the chemistry is on point.",

However, I agree that she became bland as soon as she became more like a love interest than an independent character. On her own, she was smart, cunning, and resilient. That said, her romance with Yeon could not compete with the intensity of Yeon's relationship with Rang, which was probably the most compelling relationship on the show. I guess, I can see why people said her acting was bland (or writing?) because Kim Bum crafted a very riveting Lee Rang. Even after he made up with his brother, Rang still made the audience's heart ache.",

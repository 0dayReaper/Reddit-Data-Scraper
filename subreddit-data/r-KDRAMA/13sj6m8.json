I have included the YouTube/Spotify link for each song so do take a listen before you submit your votes. I have found some songs that I like the previous time we held it for the 2010s songs. So don't just go for the songs you know and you might discover some gems.\n\nEach group will be up for about 2 days. Your votes will determine the final seeds. Only the Top 128 will move on the proper bracket.\n\nHead [here](https://animebracket.com/favourite-kdrama-ost-song-of-2020-2021-2022/vote) to view the group and submit your votes!\n\nDo feel free to give your comments about the songs in the group as well as predictions for what might take up the high seeds.",

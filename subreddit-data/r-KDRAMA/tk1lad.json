Id even say alot of how their characters seem to come to life is also due to the contrast in personalities with their male lead counterparts, who are portrayed as more cold and logical. The contrast works in letting us feel how outgoing and crazy these girls are. Then you have characters like grandpa and the work colleagues to make it a great cast all around.",

Pacing is superb and even though it has a lot of tropes common with Kdrama romcoms, it is its own exemplary, one of a kind self!",

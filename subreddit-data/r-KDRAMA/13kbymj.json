I wish the writer didn\u2019t add these two traumatic parts to carry the plot forward!

            "comment": "**Episode 7 &amp; 8**\n\nI think this show is neither about redemption nor revenge. It\u2019s a show about trauma and how it can permanently alter the wiring of our brains such that people's worst traits are amplified and their other \u201cgood\u201d traits either get subdued or suppressed over time or that they\u2019re just not strong enough to compensate for the inevitable consequences of the \u201cbad\u201d traits. That's what we see with the mom. If you see her interactions with the rest of the villagers, she's actually quite nice polite, understanding and caring in her own way, but with her own child she just defaults to being this extreme cruel version because she truly believes that is the best type of parenting she can provide to make sure he grows up to be her interpretation of strong and independent. At some point during the toddler years she decided the loving kindness is not the way to go and moulded him into the type of kid who she has convinced herself unlocks his true potential only through extreme abusive tactics. \n\nShe is so deeply in need of help and therapy because she carries with her such deep trauma and unprocessed grief. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re meant to particularly like or love any of these characters. They\u2019re all deeply flawed and problematic. If anything I see it as means for us to reflect upon all the flaws we carry and what happens when we transfer that burden onto our children and families.\n\nHaving said that you bet your bottom dollar I wanna see Kang Ho\u2019s original plan of action kick into gear and for all the dominoes to fall in place. Then I would love to see a detailed explanation and apology to Mi Joo for the way she\u2019s been treated. That girl\u2019s resilience and courage is astounding. She\u2019s probably softer and more understanding and trusting than she should be but she\u2019s approaching her life with a kindness no one else around her is. The twins deserve their happy ending. \n\nStill don\u2019t see the point of the annoying singer dude. Sam shik and the goons need to 100% band together and take down the real baddies. Hehe.",

Kang-ho still not recovered, her farm still empty and ownerless, and her dead. when she first heard her diagnosis, she said she could not die because her son needed her. once she had made arrangements for someone to care for and help her son recover, she felt like it wouldn't matter if she went. \n\nI think that Kang ho walking was natural progressed and expected of this episode or the next. The suicide attempts were in comparison rather unanticipated and I felt like it was sort of realistic, actually. A few episodes ago, she probably wouldn't consider suicide an option whatsoever, but in the face of some rapid, devastating changes (diagnosis, farm gone, maybe even hearing that the other villagers wanted the pig farm gone) it suddenly seemed the best one available to her. a relatively less painful death than the one awaiting her, and one that she has considerably more control over.\n\ni think that her seeing her son stand up to save her was meant to be some sort of emotional epiphany. either way, she'll die, but better to die after spending what time she has left preparing her son and helping him recover. i think it's super in character tbh!\n\ndamn realized after i wrote all this that it sounds aggressive but i really just wanted to offer my perspective\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I was initially so upset cause it's hard to watch as he's just a helpless 7 yo now. But as the ep progressed my heart became so happy from all the warmth. Also best ep after a long time entirely because musician guy was missing(at least for the major part). Please put him and his grating voice away from my screen.\n\nMi-joo, my lovely and hardworking girl. You deserve all the flowers in the world. Please get happy soon.\n\nI knew what was coming when the villagers discussed getting Kang-ho a &gt;!new wheelchair but even then I was so happy to see him walk towards them with a beautiful smile.!&lt; I almost choked when Mr.Son hugged Kang-ho's legs in happiness. What a beautiful bond they all share. \n\nThe mafia duo have turned into comedy duo and I'm so here for it lol. I literally can't take them seriously with those sweaters. They're like Tom and Jerry but in a crime set up.\n\nSam-sik is turning out to be one of my favs and I'm loving his clownish antics. And special shout-out to Mrs.Son aka the masked lady cause despite seeming to be very superficial she was the only one who was loyal to Kang-ho's mom throughout. Shows her honesty!\n\nSo now we've established that Kang-ho **IS** the twins' father, right? Otherwise it'd be a cheap twist if they say someone else is the father. I love Mi-joo's tiny changes in expressions whenever she's with Kang-ho. Her observing him together with the kids was lovely. Also I almost shed a tear when Kang-ho said that may be &gt;!Mi-joo wasn't abandoned by that person after all.!&lt; Also ngl when they showed the 30 yo Kang-ho I was a bit happy. And when Kang-ho walked I was even happier. No wonder Ye-jin's heart fluttered.\n\nBut the family photo is making me nervous. I know what's gonna happen but I'm not ready for it yet",

She doesn't deserve to have a financial burden that she wasn't responsible for unfairly placed on her.\n* That was a magical moment when Kang-ho made his grand entrance, having gotten back on his feet in life.

Excellent child actors. Ra Mi-ran and Lee Do-hyun keep breaking my heart more and more and I just want them to be happy. Is that too much to ask?

As much as I love this drama, it feels like it\u2019s piling misery upon misery at this point.\n\n- And indeed it proved to be too much for Young-soon to take as well. The outing to the public bath was a rare ray of hope in this episode, before it was all set to end in tragedy, averted only by a timely miracle.",

When they got together as adults, she said that although she's still working on getting her life/career started, she wanted to help support him. In my view, all those things she said to Sam Shik about working together to earn money and paying debt and struggling together but still living happily, that's what she wanted to do with Kang Ho in their 20s. \n\nSo when her and Kang Ho broke up, she responded by questioning if he whatever it was that he wanted to do, didn't include her. she took it as him saying that this was her limit and that she can't come any further with him. Even more so when he gave her money - which is why she lashed out and responded like oh is this all I'm/our relationship was worth? Not that much.\n\nBut also as a child she was the one that tended to her mom while her dad physically beat the mom and partied away with other women. So in some ways she may think that her kids having no father is better than a father that would choose something/someone else over them.",

Youngsoon is such a character though, sometimes I hate her, sometimes I wanna give her the biggest hug. Also, this show had made me realise something, I avoid conflict. Mijoo and Kangho's story has made the air \"awkward\" for me, and I find myself contemplating a click on the episode, thinking how mijoo and kangho will interact this time. I hate that mijoo has to suffer with all the memories but kangho remembers nothing. Not that it's his fault, it's just sad. This is only getting more depressing. I predict the ending will be something like Kangho recovering and continuing Youngsoon's farm and crying over his loss. The 35 year old Kangho has a lot to say to his mother. Though, we can slowly see them justify her actions. Example, for the picnic, she said her family and her husband went out with her gimbap and never returned. Who knows how they will justify her other actions? Like the thing she did after his SAT that REALLY made their relationship break down.\nEDIT: just saw the last scene. Screw you writers.

I honestly don't know what to make of this episode. &gt;!The first time she throws him into the river im like no! you are making the same bad mother mistake again he will hate you etc. But thankfully they didnt go down that road. Kang Ho can walk now which is great. Mi Joo clearly loves Kang Ho and the kids love him too. I love the Sam Sik actor from Alcemy of souls but i hope he doesnt turn into a bad guy becuz he wants Mi Joo. Kang Ho's mother teaching him stuff was cool and then she is teaching him how to behave in her funeral.!&lt; That was pretty sad. I'm excited for what's to come in the next 2 eps tho. &gt;!Wonder what's in the memory card.!&lt;",

In Ep.1 he said that bad people killed his father, and it\u2019s clear it was words coming out of her mouth. She pushed him to become person he didn\u2019t want, doing a profession he hated to get power. He reach the point of not caring whether he dies or not as long as he gets revenge\u2026 that\u2019s her doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s in such danger. Her being a bad, pushy, abuse and strict mother made him the man he is. KH has a natural sensitivity and kindness to him, if she nurtured these aspects of him, he\u2019d be happy, and safe. \n\nAll this situation stems from her. So, I think even though it\u2019s not directly connected to them at this moment, this bad seed of him making such choices and life has been panted since he was born. Her love was very conditional.",

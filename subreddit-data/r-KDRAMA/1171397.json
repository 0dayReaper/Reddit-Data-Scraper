YiNa tried so hard to do the right thing, calling 911, but the others lying puts her in a difficult position. I need this to be resolved in Ep 12 so I can relax again.",

I particularly liked the part where haru linked the bully's mindset to future abuser and played with his mind to help block such tendencies. \n\nThis is actually the best part of this drama, it feels silly and fun but there are serious issues that are lightly touched in every episodes. \n\nI love seeing grumpy haru's face light up every time he gives a mini lecture. \n\nSo the brain director turns out to be the murderer as expected. Will miss the silly guys and random brain knowledge.",

It was actually hilarious. \n\nThese last two episodes have been much better since we've got out of that ex-wife/team leader love triangle nonsense. The cliffhanger in the episode was pretty predictable, but it's got me rallied for the last 2 episodes next week.",

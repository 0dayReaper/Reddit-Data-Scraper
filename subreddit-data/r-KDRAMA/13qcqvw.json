I spent 12 straight hours on Saturday night, ditched my girlfriends and devoured the show in one sitting. I now get the hype and I can\u2019t wait for today\u2019s episodes to release. Let\u2019s go Bora!\n\nEdit: are they really ending the show at 14? And they are adding more &gt;!complications with everyone in this drama? WTH is Suhyeok waiting for? I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not shooting his shot. They could have given us an entire fluffy 14, but I guess the angst continues.!&lt;\n\nEdit 14: I honestly really &gt;!likes Suhyeok\u2019s confession. It was so typically him to point out her flaws and yet tell her he likes everything about her. Ugh. Cute. Also the aegyo I can\u2019t get over that. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see that side to his character but I\u2019m happy I did. Apart from our two leads the other stories didn\u2019t do anything for me. Their closures were meh, to be honest. But I think I was cringing most with Sungjin and Uri. They almost resembled father and daughter to me and when I rewatch this show I will happily skip these two and maybe the other four as well.\nSuhyeok and Bora, they\u2019ll do!!&lt;",

Last week's episodes were so good, episode 13 made me want to break my television.  \n\n&gt;!For the love of God why are we wasting the entire second to last episode on annoying ex drama and mealy mouthed miscommunications?  Bo Ra not forcefully shutting her garbage ex down after all the character growth we're supposed to have seen from her?  Soo Hyuk still can't actually articulate his feelings at all?  What are we doing here? Especially after all the sweet but also substantive moments between our leads last week?  !&lt;This is such a grotesque squandering of the limited time we have left with these characters.  I realize the show advanced the plot for the other couples but I'm not watching this show for the subpar supporting characters, I'm watching it for the (potentially) great lead couple, and episode 13 was such a frustrating step back.  If we're supposed to be rooting for these people to be together they shouldn't be regressing as the story reaches its conclusion.    \n\n   \nAs a viewer I didn't have a problem with Bo Ra's extended messy mourning of her failed relationship in the first half of the drama.  Yoo In Na's performance was so excellent and I thought the writers wrote some powerful dramatic moments as well as some squirmy but successful cringe comedy.  They also did a good job with her finally salvaging some dignity and \"breaking up\" on her terms.  That should have been the end of it.  Her ex should have never appeared on the show again.  &gt;!That he's still here and actually acting as an obstacle to the leads in the second to last episode is malpractice. !&lt;\n\nI'm sure they'll get it together tomorrow but today's episode was not it.",

You can\u2019t blame her for wanting him to speak less cryptically about what he feels and just say it straight.

In ep 12 we had Bora pulling back and him pushing forward to the point Bora even had to ask him why he kept seducing her. I think their major issue is mistiming, we saw Bora not ready in ep 12 and now she realized that he actually meant what he said in previous episodes only for her to be ready and he\u2019s regressing cus he\u2019s in-secured about her ex &amp; her feelings. Someone once said that during the time Bora was getting over her ex fully Suhyeok was pretty occupied and vice versa, I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s not really clear on where she stands, plus he saw her enter the ex car, the ex told him Bora said they were together for work &amp; Bora wasn\u2019t outrightly rejecting the ex. \n\nPersonally I think he should have jus let her speak and he listens fr cus sis was about to lay everything on the table for him and he wouldn\u2019t even let her.

            "comment": "Wow... episode 13... what are the writer's thinking? If they are trying to have two plot twist, the show should have been 16 or 20 episodes. They introduced one new storyline &gt;! with the bs of Bomi's pregnancy !&lt; and everything going on with Yungjeon and her husband. Why make the story so convoluted when we had such nice resolution on the last episode?\n\nI did not think I could dislike Yuhwan more but he comes back in, makes a mess and keeps on trying to bulldoze Bora into accepting him, completely disregarding her feelings. &gt;! he almost ruined her show just to give that bs confession and end up quoting fucking Elon Musk??? girlies, AVOID AT ALL COST any man that quotes Musk, period. !&lt; I hate the fact that the have him making Bora and SooHyuk doubt each other. &gt;! I hate that SooHyuk backed down EVERY SINGLE TIME, he just expected the path to be made of roses and it felt horrible seeing him not fight for her when it was so obvious Yuhwan mas making her uncomfortable. I hate Bora had to confess first and he's still reticent, I hate she's having to basically beat a confession out of him !&lt;\n\nAlso, Bomi? Bomi? Bomi! &gt;! I retract what I said about her last week. When she tells Bora why she's \\[bora\\] acting as if she \\[bomi\\] did anything wrong. Bro, did you do anything right? She's been a month with a guy that told her he loved her the first week of dating, and got pregnant. Neither of them have a full time job, or even a house. They were having sex in the floor of a basement, and they got pregnant. I wanted Bora to slap him so bad. I was thinking earlier in the episode \"ah maybe he's not that bad, good job\" when he told Yuhwan off for being a pathetic weirdo clinging onto his ex, and I felt so nice because SOMEONE had to told him and I was raging it was not SooHyuk but god, his face makes me want to scream now !&lt;\n\nI hope Yungjeon divorces her husband. He finally told her his feeling, and immediately dipped when she tried to keep the conversation going and he got scared. I felt so bad for her when she described how he was when they were dating. \n\nGod, I do not know what to expect tomorrow. The writers set the table for a beautiful party with last week's episode (for me, to rewatch this show when it was over) and then decided to burn the building down. I wanted to see Bora and SooHyuk going on dates, and introducing each other to friends. Maybe see Yuhwan and Yuri green with envy because okay? That group pic at the wedding where SooHyuk is looking at Bora and Yuri is looking at him? I melted. I'm sorry guys I hold grudges like a mdf and I am emotionally attached to SooHyuk, so hearing Yuri say she wanted to see him suffer set me off and made me dislike her. I know he was bad to her, and he's doing the same thing to Bora now.. Why am I like this...",

As much as I appreciate getting to see the other characters plots tied up (and there were some hilarious moments in the coffee shop scene), why are we introducing new arcs for them when we need to know how Bo Ra and Su Hyeok evolve?\n\nI loved the way episode 12 ended and it started so strong with the radio scene and Bo Ra going back on the show. I think it would've made more sense for her character to turn Ju Wan down completely when they had coffee. Edited to add that I think the ex coming back is very realistic and I like that the show has done that throughout but at this point of the season, it\u2019s repetitive. I just want to see our main leads moving forward because their scenes are the best and when the show really shines \ud83e\udd79",

Soo Hyuk is following the same trajectory as he did with his ex where they both were never clear with each other about their feelings, leaving things open for misunderstandings. He also unfortunately has the previous experience of being left for someone else (a better match formally for Yu Ri and in his mind, based on their long history and Sang Jin\u2019s comments, currently as well), and so he immediately doubled down on the idea that he had lost her and started pushing her away to protect himself. He needs someone to come out and say it because of this past trauma , which I expect Bo Ra will do tomorrow when she inevitably finally releases her draft essay. This time though, he will love her enough to fight for it unlike with his ex and so thus we get character growth. That\u2019s my prediction and on paper it sounds good and is realistic, but as a viewer and lover of romance K-dramas, it\u2019s a little frustrating to see this back-sliding. I think all is going to end well though tomorrow!",

I want to kick his ball sacks right now.\n\nWth. &gt;! pregnancy???? !&lt;\n\nOkay. A lot of things happened in this episode but nothing really moved forward. Man, it started so good but end up getting so annoyed - with the ex suddenly getting territorial; the pregnancy which is so off tangent; and then the frustrating hesitations of the 2 leads. After all the things she went through with the ex, why is she hesitant to completely shut the door in his face? After all the heartbreak he went through because he couldn't express it to his ex, what's keeping him from going all in with Bora??? Gaaaaah. Why are they not properly communicating when they used to be so honest with eachother???\n\nYes, we're indeed back to episode 1 and by the looks of it in the preview, at least this time, the tables have turned. He's the drunk mess and she's the one rescuing him. Lol. I hope they don't use tomorrow's episode to be filled with miscommunications, more push and pull and then pack everything in the last 15min. It'll be annoying tp watch. Though I have an idea why Soo Hyuk got drunk. &gt;! They're probably prepping for Bomi's wedding and Soo Hyuk thought it's Bora who is getting married. If he confesses while he is drunk, then that is such a downgrade from what I've expected of him. I hope I'm wrong. I liked this drama because the leads' actions were sober and intentional no matter how much they denied it. The kiss, the back and forth flirting were all sober. So, a drunken confession is kinda out of character. !&lt; it's so lame if they do that. I really hope I'm wrong.\n\nI know the last scene annoyed the hell iut of us but it was so well written and well acted. The frustration and annoyance in Yoon Hyun Min's and Yoo In Na's faces were so real. I can't stop rewatching.",

            "comment": "I wanted to add one more top-level comment after reading many of the other comments because a lot of people have been really hard on the final JuHwan 'confession' scene and I wanted to say why I loved it so much and thought it was important as well as SuHyeok's confession.  \n\n\nJuHwan has always been a sleaze with no real love for Bora or ability to love sincerely overall and we see this in his final scene. He is the same self-obsessed player he always was but now wah wahing over the loss of his favourite toy. I loved the comedic effect of the scene and felt that the final episode needed something funny like this, but more importantly, I think it added an important thematic element to the main characters' relationship narrative.  \n\n\nJuHwan has always been 'romantic' and good at reading Bora's hints about what she wanted in a relationship (as we see in ep1 where he gets her hint on the radio about wanting a ring/confession for example and some of the flashbacks to their gaudy dates). In his final 'confession' scene despite the Elon Musk cringe he does a 'dramalike' romantic confession with all the things Bora has said she likes (sparkly thing, flowers, dramatics, etc). which makes for a 'memorable' confession and seems to be in the same or a similar restaurant to the one where she initially hoped she would be proposed to. This is the type of 'drama-like' confession Bora THOUGHT she always wanted, but her blood runs cold when she gets it because it's 1. from the wrong man and 2. completely lacking sincerity or real commitment. We see Bora get what she supposedly wanted when she started her 'getting ex back' book plot with her getting the exact confession she wanted in ep1 complete with dramatics, flowers, big speech and everything. Remember in ep1 she was still waiting for a confession even while he monologued about Elon Musk, meaning she was OK with this kind of terrible self-absorbed man as long as he gave her the dramatic dream relationship steps she had fantasized about.  \n\n\nIn contrast SuHyeok's 'underwhelming' confession a few minutes later is meaningful precisely because it is so stilted and sincere. It isn't the drama confession she was waiting for and it doesn't sound especially romantic but it has the earnestness and honesty that she always wanted from SuHyeok - not some big affair but just a confirmation of the feelings she already knew he had. He spent a significant portion of the last 2ish episodes doubting that he was right for her but he got over himself and just said what he was really feeling anyway, also having the guts to go and take her away from the guy he thought she might 'want' more than himself, he was awkward and unprepared, but it turns out the thing Bora always (didn't know she) needed was confirmation of real love, not some fantasy scenario she could write a book about or talk about on instagram. This is driven home by her narration about couples kissing in public and how she always found it cringe, but understands how when you're really in love you feel like the only two people in the world. He was the ONLY person she wanted to hear this from and so the way he delivered the message didn't even matter.  \n\n\nAlso for all Suhyeok's cowardice let's not forget that he took her 'advice' in stride earlier and tried to deliver the romantic confession she wanted earlier (beginning of ep13).  He had the 'little sparkly thing,' the 'flowers that all women like,' and a very romantic confession card with some literary phrasing talking about how in love with her he was all ready to go, but he chickened out because of self-doubt. But he WAS about to deliver this romantic confession to her before his resolve was shaken. But what did she say to him after she discovered all the stuff in his room? 'I don't want a guy who says some crap about a lavender haze, I just need someone who will tell it to me straight that they love me.' So we see both their character development here, 1. Bora no longer wants a 'fantasy drama confession' and 2. Suhyeok goes there emptyhanded just wanting to tell her how he really feels. The deal is already sealed by how much they love each other and it doesn't matter that the way the message is delivered is awkward and stilted, as long as it's sincere and believable.   \n\n\n I think the juxtaposition of JuHwan's \"romantic\" confession and Suhyeok's awkward one was necessary to deliver the main message of the show which is that neither Bora's original approach (doing things by the book, impressing others with your relationship) nor Suhyeok's (being cool, literary, collected) are what's really needed when two people love one another. When You Know You Know but you both have to level with one another.",

            "comment": "I read much of these comments before entering the last two episodes, and while I understand how many feel like it was rushed or a bit messy or parts were dragged on for too long, I still thought it was refreshing that they were able to portray how relationships realistically function, esp. with the lead couple.\n\n&gt;!I thought it was realistic for Bo-Ra to still hear out Ju-Wan, especially given their history. You don't just move on from a long-term relationship like this; it's realistic that she would at least pause to hear him out. I've been there. I've reconsidered exes, even if I did turn away from them in the end. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Also, Su-Hyeok's reactions are realistic as well. It's hard not to make certain judgments when you overhear stuff or misinterpret something\u2014Bo-Ra is right; he was prideful and needs to own up to his actions. He was trying to protect himself from pain, which isn't an excuse but more like an explanation of how he has always operated. We're hardwired a certain way to protect ourselves and it takes a lot of processing, self-awareness, and maybe even some outside advice/support to finally change and, in his case, take the risk of being vulnerable. Thankfully, in the end, he did. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!While I felt like Yu-Jeong and Jin-Woo's relationship was going to fail, it made sense for them to reconcile. I know a lot of people here were saying they should have just divorced, and we see Yu-Jeong considering it for a moment. But I've seen a lot of friends go through dry, lukewarm seasons of marriage and emerge from it having grown and matured after some time. I'm also now married, and what they are going through is relatable and also workoutable, despite the instances when Jin-Woo really screwed up. Because it is easy to take your loved one for granted, esp. when in your heart you know you won't leave. It's also easy to just see someone's flaws and nag them about every mistake without taking the time to ask them for their side because we only see our pain. It happens, esp. when you're comfortable, you're busy, and you're tired. But what matters is that they're actually able to apologize and try again, even if the change takes time as long as you want to remain committed and trying.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Bo-Mi and Jin-Ho seemed to be a portrait of young love. I mean, lots of teens get knocked up and often the man ditches the woman but sometimes, he stays and take responsibility for the pregnancy. I think the point IS to portray that they're young, irresponsible, immature, and need all the support they can get. That shit happens irl waaaayyyy more than we like to think, so why can't it happen in a k-drama? I do wish they had a moment of sharing their fears with each other. That would at least point to some growth on both their parts, esp. with Bo-Mi. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sang-Jin and U-Ri still creeped me out a bit. She just seemed too young compared to Sang-Jin, though she's not necessarily a minor either. But a love like that does happen, and it certainly walks the fine line of appropriateness. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I think in the end, each couple gave us all different portraits of what it means to be \"true to love.\" I still do wish for 16 episodes. I wanted more fluff from the main couple. But overall, it was still such a good show. Yoo In-Na and Yoon Hyun-Min really carried it. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yoo In-Na's acting is just so good\u2014she portrayed Bo-Ra really well without her being too much of a caricature/stereotype. She gave the character a depth that can be hard to pull off if you lean too much either in the comedy or drama. Hyun-Min portrayed Su-Hyeok in a manner that was both vulnerable and cool. The way he emotes with his eyes is just... chef's kiss. It would be too easy to just lean on the cool side, but I felt moved every time he found himself in a vulnerable place because his eyes would speak for him. I would love to see Hyun-Min in more rom-coms and dramas, in general. I grew fond of him while watching this show. !&lt;\n\nEdits: changed some wording.",

            "comment": "Second comment for this week:\n\nI always wondered why Yujeong kept accepting the bare minimum from her husband but this episode explains it, he used to be different until he changed (of course his reason doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse his recent behaviors but at-least it explains why he changed) the writer of this drama enjoys/dwells on miscommunication, withdrawing and holding back so much, every relationship in the drama has had miscommunication, withdrawing &amp; holding back as part of the major reason for why it didn\u2019t work and now it\u2019s happening with our leads again. \n\nSeeing Jinwoo so worked up actually felt good. Likewise seeing Yujeong call him out on his bs again felt good. They needed this heated up conversation. I kinda get where he was coming from, I\u2019m so big on alone time, after school and work I jus want my space to recharge but then I also understood where Yujeong was coming from they\u2019re a pair now and they could get to do a lot of things together, thinking that there\u2019s still time for them to do everything doesn\u2019t make sense cus what if you lose the person along the line. \n\nWasn\u2019t expecting the pregnancy plot for the young lovers so I was shocked, didn\u2019t think anything else could have me surprised in this drama lol. I can\u2019t feel bad for them cuz they should have taken proper measures\u270b\ud83c\udffd. Anyways it was nice seeing them both step up. Also I loved that Yujeong told Bora about Bomi\u2019s pregnancy I know it wasn\u2019t in her place but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be okay w her keeping quiet about it.\n\nAlso am I the only one whom Juwan makes their blood boils? He\u2019s so annoying. The scene w Jinho x Bomi x Juwan was funny though.",

            "comment": "While I too am a bit frustrated at this stall between Bora and Suhyeok, the writers are pretty realistic in their writing. I know we all saw growth in Bora and her letting go of her ex, but we're talking about feelings and memories... 3 years of it. So regression is not surprising. Plus Bora is still emotionally vulnerable as you can see on the radio show. And since the first episode, we've already seen Suhyeok's flaws so him not saying what's on his mind, isn't much of a surprise.\n\nI also liked Yu Jung and Sang Jin's conversation about spending time together esp when being in a long term relationship and that they would see each other daily. This has been somewhat of a close situation to what I experienced and seeing it happen on screen makes me feel less alone.\n\nThe pregnancy was really a surprise. But I'm interested in how Bomi and Junho will react. While it's a bit of a curve ball in the plot, I like how the writers didn't just play it off but showed us the moments when they were separately anxious and worried but tried to keep a happy face for each other.\n\nLooking forward to the finale. This show was refreshing and I love how realistic it tries to be when covering breakups, long term relationship/marriage and young love. I find that there's an realism aspect here that is not seen much in other shows.",

She\u2019s ready and now it is his turn to decide if he will learn to communicate or not.\n\nLike previous episodes pointed out, if he wants to, he will.

After that *messy previous episode,* I already knew they were gonna rush things so I didn't have any big expectations as to how they'd wrap this up. \n\nBUT WTF? I'm really disappointed with these side characters' stories.\n\nI really thought the UrixCEO thing was over. &gt;!What possessed these writers to turn things around and make them a couple? Like what was the point of adding that co-worker scene when it was gonna be true anyway?!&lt; The CEO didn't even stand up for her that time either. I was finally starting to like Uri after she stood up for herself too...\n\nThe whole pregnancy thing was unnecessary, period. I'm confused as to what it added to the plot. There was an earlier scene a couple episodes ago where Bomi was saying how she had felt like she was at a loss when it came to her future and career. Why didn't they explore that? Instead they threw her in the cafe and got her pregnant. &gt;!Surprised there wasn't even any mention of how they'd take care of a baby financially which seems like the bigger issue. We just got Bomi acting out at Bora again \ud83d\ude44!&lt;\n\nNot even sure what to say about Yujeong and her husband. Not too happy with &gt;!how everything was smoothed over just like that. I feel like in the end its only Yujeong making adjustments and being more understanding. !&lt;However, I will say -&gt;!that scene of them playing games together was kinda cute. !&lt;\n\nThey really did us dirty with the amount of screen time the leads got this episode. \n\nWhile I, too, am frustrated it took THIS long for them to admit their feelings, I'm more upset&gt;!we only got like 15 minutes of them being an actual couple. I wanted to see more of Bora and Suhyeok (HIM ESPECIALLY) being dumb and cute together. Like baby talking Suhyeok?? Suhyeok trying to publish a book confessing his love to Bora?? I literally squealed when she found the ring in the mitten. And not him going in for a kiss TWICE in that last scene.!&lt; He's really playing the \"he fell harder\" part well \ud83d\ude06\n\nSIGH.

I have really enjoyed the Reddit commenter analysis of all the characters and their motivations.  When Reddit does another couple bracket, they will be at the top of my list.\n\nWriters:  Please Stick the Landing.  Don\u2019t stretch the mis-understanding until the last 10 minutes of Ep. 14.  Don\u2019t magically change Soo-hyuk\u2019s character into a verbose, talkative sappy romantic.  Bo-ra \u2013 your life is not a k-drama fairy-tale, so authentic will hopefully win the day.

Ep 13 absolutely sucked balls IF its a 14 episode order. if they give us a bonus 15th episode then fine, throw random stupid hurdles all you want. If this show does indeed end on episode 14 I will not be giving it more than 3 stars when uptil ep 12 it was a solid 4.5 for me. It was funny, light, sweet, cute, even despite the annoying side characters relationships subplots and frustrating ex of Boras. It was a breath of fresh air, a character who is a hot mess in the beginning but then genuinely grows as a person after hitting rock bottom, the honest conversations between her and So hyeok were so good, their communication and ability to call each other out and simply discuss things was such an adult and beautiful dynamic. But this episode was just...frustrating.\n\nYes, I understand that people who are healing from breakups do regress, they do become insecure and tend to relapse into their old patterns especially when confronted with a potential new romantic relationship infront of them which is scary once your feelings for that person and the possibility of a relationship with them becomes real because its not just butterflies and the cutesy phase of the beginning where youre falling for each other anymore, now, suddenly theres a possibility of you getting hurt again as you embark on another romantic relationship, relapses and regression can happen, yes, i fully acknowledge that. But I didnt want it here, in this story line, in the penultimate episode. It takes away from the honesty and communication that bora and so hyeok have built so far. Could they have approached this same impasse that Bora and so hyeok find themselves at in the end of ep 13 differently? Where when he &gt;!sees her get in her exes car he has an honest discussion with her about what she wants now from her ex, as her friend like he has been this whole time?!&lt;\n\nI genuinely am pretty dishearted because now all you're going to get is a rushed conclusion where Bora ends up with So hyeok in the last 20 min or theres a time lapse where they are happy together eventually or she rejects So hyeok too because he needs time to grow and get over his relationship/communication/verbalisation issues and Bora decides shes happy being on her own for now and thats what her book ends up being about. Yu jeong is headed for a divorce and Bo mi just gives bratty spoilt child vibes for real because the writers didnt bother giving her a backstory to explain why exactly shes like this so to the audience shes not super lovable or mature, just a tantrum throwing sister who doesnt deal with the consequences of her actions.

Deborah's commitment to being true to herself, and the chemistry she had with Suhyeok...I really adored their dynamic, and I enjoyed watching them fall for each other and deny it as it all built up to an inevitable MORE.\n\nSo...episode 14. &gt;!Gosh was it disappointing. Episode 12 was...perfect. They were so close, on the cusp of a confession/kiss/HEA. And then the misunderstandings in 13, and the delays in 14...they just didn't make sense. You're telling me after all the growth and learning Suhyeok did while getting to know Bora, he couldn't tell her he liked her? I \\*wanted\\* an explosive 'drama-like' confession. I needed that to happen. I needed that kiss. Instead, it fell so flat \ud83d\ude2d I'm so upset about how it turned out, despite being a happy ending. They just couldn't keep the tension that had been so deliciously built up until that point. For the other couples: I had really hoped Uri and Sangjin wouldn't get together. I liked that he seemed to reciprocate her feelings but wanted to do what was right--having one couple not work out would've been realised. At times, I was even rooting for Yujeong's divorce, although I wasn't mad they worked out. !&lt;\n\nAlso &gt;!sorta disappointed by Juwan's arc. Yes, he's trash and shameless, we knew that (when he was dating that girl right after the breakup? gross). But to find out that he's two-timing Bora again seemed like a regression of HIS growth as well. Idk. I did enjoy seeing Bami? Dami? throw water on him and push him back in his seat though lmao. Chansung does these types of characters really well.!&lt;\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this show and ugh, the break-up and the main relationship (Suhyeok/Bora) was so mature and I really liked the choices they made. I just &gt;!disliked the confession and the final-kiss. The karoake kiss was much better, which isn't great considering the final kiss should've been the one that hit. And all the flirting! the longing glances!! The \\*LAVENDER HAZE\\* part of their relationship \ud83d\ude2d We never got to see any of that in the last two episodes. !&lt;",

Idk what the plot will be but the writers can figure that out because where are our couple scenes?!?! \ud83e\udee0\n\nAs long as it took, Su-Hyeok\u2019s confession was fitting!!! He had me swooninggg and squealinggg today \ud83e\udd2d that &gt;!crying scene?! The confession?! The note?!!&lt;  yeah Su-Hyeok got me today \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc97\n\nI was so proud of Bo-Ra, she has truly grown. Both she and Su-Hyeok grew and I loved their foundation. I feel so robbed with how little we got from them \ud83d\ude13\n\nEvery time the married couple, &gt;!pregnant!&lt; couple, or office couple came on the screen I was saying \u201cwrap it up\u201d. I didn\u2019t care about any of them by the end of the show. \n\nMarried couple made up as best as they could but Jin Woo just seemed so uninterested the entire drama that I can\u2019t be convinced they\u2019ll last. They had a decent convo but it was too late for me to be sold on them.\n\nBo-Mi is a brat and I have no idea why her loveline got so much screentime and a plot twist. Her going off on her sister for simply trying to tell her to think about her decisions is crazy \ud83d\ude2d I get feeling controlled but she was just tryna be a guardian. Even scheduled a doctors appointment for her and Bo-Mi is going off about not wanting to go with her \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I thought the conversation Bo-Ra and Yeong-Ju were having about marriage and love in front of Bo-Mi would\u2019ve at least made her reconsider rushing to marry but I guess not. Both of them are 2 young lovebirds ready to conquer the world with their love\u2026 I could\u2019ve done without them \n\nLast, our office couple. Why Sang-Jin is dating his employee, idk. They did nothing for me and they don\u2019t match at all to me. U-Ri is like a fish out of water compared to Sang-Jin but they said it themselves so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBest thing about this drama was the leads and I would certainly go back and watch them again \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe  this show was the mood booster I needed also. I will secretly be hoping for another season, a special episode, something \ud83e\udd72\ud83d\udc97\n\nI wanna give this a 9/10 but I feel robbed and I didn\u2019t like any of the other couples. Maybe a 8-8.5/10",

But those were from before 2013 so that was probably the standard back then. But 14, huh?\n\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed the pace of a 12 episode series and definitely a 16 episode series. &gt;!This felt like it was going the pace of a 16 episode series but then they hit that gas pedal and seemed to rush everything in episode 14. !&lt;\n\n\nWell speaking of episode 14, &gt;! I did appreciate Suhyeok\u2019s \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d type monologue when he finally confesses his feelings for Bo Ra. Before that though I was starting to really dislike his character. I mean Bo Ra admitted she likes Suhyeok and he still couldn\u2019t admit his feelings to her. At that point I felt he didn\u2019t deserve her. I still kinda feel that way honestly. But oh wells. They rushed the endings for all the couples in the show and wrapped them up in Xmas bows and \u201cthey all lived happily ever after\u201d lol!&lt;\n\nIt was a cute series. I will probably rewatch it in the very near future after going through some other stories.",

It was obvious this was completely written in advance and I felt the pacing was very steady.  \n\n\nI think SuHyeok's character was deliberately consistent in his shortcomings. This wasn't a show about fantasy people but realistic people. His slow character development and consistency felt realistic for me.  \n\n\nI also don't think the ending was meant as a 'happily ever after.' Bora's narration says this is just a moment in time and an open ending, and things can change after the ending. I felt there were heavy hints that two of the couples would not survive past this ending (Sangjin/Uri, YuJeong/Jinwoo) but at that snapshot in time they were sort of doing OK.",

            "comment": "Like most people here, I loved the main leads and their story till episode 12 but the last two episodes did not stick the landing for me. It wasn\u2019t terrible but could have been better. Overall, I enjoyed the show and loved the main characters and that the story dove into their breakups. I loved their conversations, banter, chemistry, reservations,.. all of it. It was refreshing and acted well.\n\nI was lukewarm about the other couples all long but the last two episodes just made it worse for them.\n\n**Our OTP**: While I get people don\u2019t change overnight, it was hard to watch the ML struggle so much in episode 13. But I could let it pass. It took away from the magic but fine. These two characters carried the show.  Strangely though, at the end of the show, the ML changes all of a sudden, wants to publish a love letter book, and gives her a ring in no time. Not to mention the aegyo :( Too drastic and too sudden. Small changes are what makes sense unless you some life threatening or some major incident.\n\n**The best friend and the husband**: I kinda get it and I have been married a long time but still, the flip to everything being so hunky-dory was too drastic and too sudden. If she was frustrated, it takes more than one sorry for them to become so lovely dovey again towards the end. It was too drastic. What would have kept in line with the show was for them to show some progress not such day and night sort of change. \n\n**The sister and her bf**: Yea, sorry. I know they are trying to show a young love that is not hesitant, but they still behave like kids\u2026 especially the sister. She shows attitude to her sister while still living off of her sister. You don\u2019t have a proper job nor can you take care of yourself but you are having a kid. Sorry, I hate shows that glorify this stuff. Most such situations don\u2019t end up well. Life is hard. That is the reality and the harsh truth of life. Romance and love don\u2019t make up for it.\n\n**The CEO and Uri**: I just wish he would left it at NO and that was that. They had zero chemistry and the whole thing made no sense. I understand why she had a crush on him but why did he like her romantically. Didn\u2019t see it at all. \n\nOverall, good show but yea, the last two episodes didn\u2019t work.",

In my opinion, the ending felt rushed and poorly executed -- and unnecessary conflict seemed to be sprinkled in at the final moments without rhyme or reason.",

The chemistry between Yoo In Na and Yoon Hyun Min was SO GOOD--get these two together again immediately!! And I actually loved all of the supporting characters--that is also very rare in my experience. This is definitely one of my favorite dramas of the year \u2764\ufe0f",

Unless I missed something, Bomi was completely dependent on her older sister. It didn't seem like she went to school or worked or did anything besides freeload off Bora. She only got a job to be with her boyfriend, a boyfriend who can't even get his own place. Adding a baby into the mix is a recipe for disaster. If the writers go down the route of, \"as long as people love each other then everything will be fine\" would also feel out of place for this kind of drama. I am curious to see how they'll wrap this storyline up.  !&lt;",

I might be the weird one but Yuri Suhyeok breakup is one of my fave scenes and why I decided to continue with ep2. Don't have to say more about the main couple, but esp like how Bora making the decision at the end, love her!  I also even enjoyed Yujeong's and Bomi's storylines.\n\nThe only thing I don't like and always skipped just Sangjin Uri scenes &gt;!We could have him as the 7th wheel, being solo at the last scene, could have been more meaningful? And maybe swap their last scenes with the reality of the difficulties of Bomi and Jinho pregnancy. At least Jinwoo mentioned about support from Jinho parents and Bora and on the generation gap, the financial struggle of current gen. Wish they unpacked more on these. !&lt;",

Too bad one more episode and it's done\ud83d\udc94\n\nI know it's too early to say this, but from all the kind of relationship that was portrayed here. I think the common denominator that they all shared is this: lack of open Communication, not being honest about what they felt, and slightly wrong timing. The ups and downs. The heartbreak and moving on stage to starting fresh and patching up things that still have a chance. The realization of mistakes to forgiving and acceptance. From being childish self-seeking to a mature man and woman. This all makes the story a one-of-a-kind ride. \n\nNo wonder everyone was hooked on this show, as everyone could relate in one way or another. \n\nIndeed depicts real life and not just a  drama kind of story.

He did more 'actions' to show his love toward Bora but he still had trouble expressing himself and committing, which I think was fitting. Whether he 'should have' been ready or not, he was written like a person and not a TV character, so he wasn't as most people in his position wouldn't be. I liked this and it was one of the real strengths of the show to me that all the characters acted consistently and 'like people' from start to finish.  \n\n\nI'm wondering why you think that it would have been satisfying for YuJeong to sacrifice more of herself for her toddler-like husband at the end? It was obviously a temporary fix because nothing was resolved, but imo it would have been EVEN MORE pathetic if she went further to placate him after everything he did to her. Even playing video games with him was sad, tragic, pathetic etc. because it was always her 'coming to him' and trying to make him happy. If she had gotten the caravan too I really would have thought she has negative spine rather than zero spine.  \n\n\nI liked Bomi couple because it was open ended but showed that love and commitment can be a positive start to a life together. They were both fully aware of the 'problems' a baby can cause but I think it was implied it can work out with all the support they have, which is pretty lovely considering all the emotionally choked up and insecure people on the show. At least there was one couple just having some courage and going for it with their relationship.",

            "comment": "I think the ending was almost perfect (I liked that SuHyeok is shown not having 100% changed, neither has BoRa 100% changed but they somehow make it through together) and really enjoyed the last ep overall (I'm glad JuHwan didn't just get cut from the last episode, his scene was one of the funniest in the show imo, I was laughing so hard) BUT  \n\n\nI am very very very unhappy about the YuJeong JinWoo resolution!! After all the trust I had in this writer I can't believe they chickened out like that and went with such a copout ending for that couple.",

            "comment": "Okay, okay, I\u2019m happy about this finale. \ud83d\ude0aSome things I really loved:\n\n* &gt;!How Bora decided on her ending herself. She chose to shoot her shot and she chose to bravely walk away instead of just accepting Suhyeok\u2019s inability to say something. !&lt;\n* &gt;!Bora's ending of the book... it's not happy or sad, it's an open ending. Life has ups and downs for sure!!&lt;\n* &gt;!I LOVE how Bora closed the ring box and pushed it away! And didn't even answer him and was just like WTF.  AND THE CHICKEN BOX lol what a nice touch to solidify how much of an idiot Juhwan is. Chansung did a really great job with this character!!&lt;\n* &gt;!I like that Suhyeok finally got his act together after reading the book, not in response to a \"threat\" from another guy.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Suhyeok's confession was such a hot mess. \ud83e\udd23 Bora was so sweet to help him out. !&lt;\n* &gt;!The ring in the mittens!!!! So low key and cute after trying for the \"drama\" ending. I LOVE that it was a completely different ring and no turquoise box (or chicken box).!&lt;\n* &gt;!I like the way the other two relationships worked out. Yujeong and Jinwoo finally communicated well and worked it out. The house wedding for the other couple was super cute! (Reminded me of Andy and April hahaha). You don't need all the wedding hoopla to commit to each other. I'm glad they didn't turn the pregnancy into a super serious or sad moment. They recognized that it was going to be difficult, but they decided to just go for it. I like that. Just simple like Bomi said.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Drunk Suhyeok was too cute. Standing up for Bora when Sangjin tried to badmouth her. Just asking for a hug.  I like that it's how Bora found out about his house (and what that meant) and found the sweet card. And I love that she brought it up later. \ud83e\udd23!&lt;\n\nThis show was really good. I'm going to rewatch it sometime for sure!",

I feel this was a very shallow and temporary fix for a very deep problem and I don't think it would work out long term.   \n\n\nBut re: the &gt;!pregnancy!&lt; I agree it was a really great handling of this 'problem' which everyone treats as a problem but is just a normal part of life for many people that they figure out and overcome. Bomi and JinHo were always the couple that just DECIDED THEY WOULD AMAKE THINGS WORK BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO and I think this was the beauty of this side couple. Not complicated and stuck in mental mazes like the other characters, just forging ahead in life trying to make the best of it.",

            "comment": "It was so painful to watch Bora lay all the cards on the table and basically offer herself up to Su-Hyeok  on a plate and watch him reject her. SMH. C\u2019mon! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fWhat was he waiting for at that point? He has confirmation that his love is reciprocated! \n\nThen he had to read an entire manuscript where she confesses her love again to finally get his shit together and chase after her? \n\nThe other storylines\u2014like others have said, I don\u2019t know why they made the CEO change his mind about Uri. They should have shown his ex-wife\u2019s reaction. \n\nAnd the pregnancy storyline was not needed. I thought she\u2019d get an abortion since she got knocked up so soon into their relationship. \n\nFor the long-married couple\u2014the solution was for her to play video games with him? She deserves better!",

While he fights against a devil, he gets transferred to a different world. Pontifex Lembrary then finds himself in a small dormitory and possesses the body of Woo Yeon Woo, who is a member of the unpopular idol group Wild Animal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The group has been together for 3 years, but they are on the verge of disbanding due to their lack of success. 9 hours later, Pontifex Lembrary is placed on a stage with Wild Animal for a live performance at a broadcasting station. When the music begins to play, Pontifex Lembrary, in Woo Yeon Woo\u2019s body, shouts out, \"I don't know how to dance.\" The live broadcast performance is a disaster, but it attracts the attention of people and the media.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With his charms, including a confident attitude, Woo Yeon Woo, still possessed by Pontifex Lembrary's spirit, becomes popular, and so does his group Wild Animal. Pontifex Lembrary must now get used to life as a member of an idol group, and he faces various troubles, like dealing with weird religious groups and the devil.\n\n* **Streaming Sources:** [TVING](https://tving.com/), [Viki](https://viki.com/), [Viu](https://viu.com/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behavior will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

Part of me wants WYW to decide to be a healer in the other world and Rembrary to stay and heal this world because he can do more here. He can heal physical ailments with divine power and mental ones through being an idol and cheering people up. This is my fanfic plot lmao. I also hope since they're going with a romance angle (which isn't in the webtoon) to have him start actually kinda feeling things. So far it's all clinical from him whereas she feels for him.!&lt;",

He's a former idol - although they weren't very successful - and also a musical actor. They won't waste it. It will be hilarious and awesome.\n\nI love this show! The way Rembrary talks down to everyone is sooooo funny. And how everyone's gotten used to it by now. Kim Min Kyu is perfection in this role. Can't wait until next week.",

I love watching Rembrary do idol activities but am getting quickly annoyed at how &gt;!the devil is able to interfere and just cause him to fail on the show and in general. He is seemingly helpless and without divine assistance which makes it a tad frustrating.!&lt; I am interested in seeing how things continue to unfold. Just hoping for more songs really because he absolutely killed it with the song in episode 3!",

Like in episode 3 the ML sings a little bit of \u201cA Little Girl\u201d by OHHYUK from Reply 1988 when he first meets with his duet partner. Then in the 4th episode, the duet\u2019s melody comes from the soundtrack of Tale of the Nine Tailed. The song\u2019s name is \u201cParting at the River of Three Crossings\u201d by Hong Dae Sung (not too sure about this one but they sound pretty similar). Those are the only two I\u2019ve recognized so far, and I hope to recognize some more later on :)",

Having said I wish they had taken a beat to expressly say that ONE of the things that helps is music and idols and not made it seem like following our fave idols can cure mental illnesses. As someone who derives great joy and strength from music and in particular attribute a lot of what\u2019s helped during the last couple of years to BTS I can definitively say it helps but isn\u2019t the solution at all!&lt;. But I will give them credit for spending so much time talking about it in the first place!\n\nI\u2019m really really enjoying KMY\u2019s portrayal here. He is so cute, so endearing and so believable. That they have him glow extra when he consumes chocolate and sugar is just hilarious and a bonus!\n\nLike others mentioned I hope we continue to get more idol related shenanigans and not just devil and the evil doings piece because he\u2019s at his best when he\u2019s attempting to be an idol \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, that song was great!",

I'm kind of hoping for some romantic development between the leads, as long as there's no switch back at the end.\n\nI'm enjoying Kathy's character a lot, knowing how many idols end up struggling with mental health issues. Also, I like that the drama is showing plenty of issues in the kpop industry while being a comedy, because it probably makes it easier to show.",

I think she also gives a really beautiful perspective into how an idol can positively affect a fan\u2019s life. I love her character. But, I do think the scenes she has with the ML could use a little editing. She goes very deep into explaining things and strategy, which, while understandable and necessary, is almost like a video game tutorial, which is a lot if you\u2019re just watching a drama and wanting to be entertained.",

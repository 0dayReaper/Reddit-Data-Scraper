I'm hesitant by the Assemblywoman but to actually use her son's death for political purposes. I won't be surprised if the ones who want Doldam's location is being lobbied by Do Yun Wan. That would be an interesting way to tie things back to s1-s2 along with Dongju coming back if this is indeed the final season!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Park Mingguk has been warned and he had to realise things the hard way!&lt;\n\n\n&gt;! I know a lot here didn't like Cha Jinman, both the character and the actor. But for me, I liked his character and what he brought to the series. Someone who's as firm as Kim Sabu but with a totally different view on things. Someone who's able to make Kim Sabu think if he's doing the right thing. Someone who won't easily adapt to the principles that the Doldam people have!&lt;\n\n&gt;! Jang Donghwa's right, you know. It's a bit frustrating to see the current situation between Areum and Euntak. Like, do something Euntak, pls!&lt;",

            "comment": "Aigoo, this is my first time commenting on a series in this subreddit at length but what a ride this series has given us! I'll spoiler all this to be safe. \n\n&gt;!Cha Jinman. I was a little bit miffed at bringing him to Doldam at first but I think it was because nothing good was coming by Cha Eunjae's father into the mix. It's like all the young doctor's have their father watching them even if it's not their father. No matter what you feel the pressure. From Kim Sabu's standpoint him and Jinman obviously have some past connection and even though it's a rivalry (in Jinman's eyes) no matter what happened before Kim Sabu always has a reason for his decision AND a backup plan. Jinman just happened to be the backup. Maybe it was for WSJ and CEJ a little bit too. They were avoiding letting her parents know they lived together maybe he was helping on that end. As for getting Jinman out and the councilwoman's real reason I hate to think that Kim Sabu also needed Director Park to seethe REAL motivation because he knew it wasn't just her wanting an \"apology\" for losing her son. She's a politician. Jinman was a battle in a war. She's playing chess and everyone else thinks it's a checkers game except for Kim Sabu. Jinman was a pawn, but also, Jinman was losing his focus as a doctor and a father and a husband. Well, maybe with a wife like his that was on purpose but I digress LOL  I don't think it was weak to make Eunjae show she loves her father. The conversation when he was driving was good for both of them. There's nothing wrong with showing and saying you love your family if you love your family/parent/child. I knew he'd accept Seo Woojin. I was sad to see him go and his words to Director Park were very ominous. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The grandma. Old, alone, dementia and she still dropping words of wisdom. Her passing had me balling like a baby but I was happy that Kim Sabu let her go instead of going all out to keep her alive. She came, she impressed and she went peacefully. I thought it was a great scene! When I was young I remember catching fireflies with my brothers in a jar and I love seeing them in shows! !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kang Dongju. Everyone's excited to see him back and he might be what the trauma center needs to take on the council woman BUT he's always and I mean from S1 had a chip on his shoulder to prove he was the best; even better than Kim Sabu. That is his bar. He matured in S1 but he's coming in as the head of the trauma center and I think his hunger to best Kim Sabu is going to rear it's ugly head once or twice. I'm not sold on his character yet. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Park Euntak and Dr. Areoum. As long as she makes him happy I will be okay with her being his choice. You will never change my mind I don't care if Kim Minjae in real life was Ted Bundy/Jeffrey Dahmer/John Gacy rolled up in one I would say \"He has his reasons, I'll allow it.\" LOL!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kim Sabu. I just realized after this episode how much faith he has in not just the younger generation but in people. How much he cares about everyone he's come in touch with (like Cha Jinman, Director Park etc) even if they aren't great interactions when he doesn't give up on them. Not only as a doctor saving lives but his sense of duty as a human being to help another human being is such a great character arc. Me myself, I have no faith in anyone from personal experience, the majority of humans in general right now in the world are garbage so it's refreshing to see on a show. If only we had more Kim Sabus in the world. I can dream too!!&lt;\n\nAll in all I'm looking forward to seeing how the writers will wrap this season up. I hope I'm not left with a longing for another season if there's no plans for it. But seeing how this is KDRAMA...",

Glad that this episode shed some light on his perspective and that he wasn\u2019t the devil he was made to look like. But a tad too late?\n\nI\u2019ve never really liked KDJ but seeing him back gives a different energy and tension to the show. He has always butted heads with Master Kim and even at the end, he was not compliant as SWJ towards Master Kim. If Master Kim say jump, SWJ would ask how high, KDJ would ask why. This is how loyal SWJ is to him. Different dynamics with KDJ, and also he\u2019s been around, his working style and thinking will be different from Master Kim\u2019s too. Looking at the preview, there will be skirmishes. And maybe KDJ never really bought into Master Kim\u2019s romance to begin with. \n\nPerhaps, at the end KDJ dun think he fits the Trauma Center afterall and leaves. And Dir Park goes to invite CJM, now a more humbled man, back? And the elephant is therefore successfully put inside the fridge and door closed nicely?",

He never supposed to leave it before too. Doldam Hospital is his place. Like In-bum said in season 2. I wish he and seo jung come back too. KDJ wasn't there before cause he was enlisted, I think maybe after that he went to leave with Seo-jung. I really hope at least in the last episode they will show all the cast from season 1 and 2 handling the hospital and trauma center.",

THE ENTRANCE!.***\n\nBut first Dr. Senior Cha - He and Kim Sabu seem to be friends at the very core and although given the rest of the previous episodes this came as a surprise to me. Also for me this isn't how I thought his arc would be like. He did a lot of stupid things in the name of ethics, rules and dignity of the doctors and this is how it goes on? \n\nalthough I loved the conversation between &gt;!Woo-Jin and Papa Cha - showed how Dr.Kim has given Woo-Jin the support and safety where he can dream again and be admant about his dreams too. I loved how soulful Woo-jin and Kim Sabu's bond. Their mere words shows how much bond they have and how they are just paperworks away from being legally father and sons.  !&lt;I also loved the conversation &gt;!Eun-Jae and Papa Cha had, honestly so heartwarming and in that moment needed by the father who was losing a lot.!&lt;\n\nAbsolutely clapped when Eun-Jae &gt;!finally gave the reality to her mother. The mother's entire speech about family and feelings to Woo-Jin felt such contradicting in that moment and I do understand how concerened a parent is for their own child however this wasn't just concern but  a proper control and in charge of her child's life - so absolutely loved that reality check reply that Eun-Jae gave.!&lt;\n\nDirector Park - You made the correct moves but you are too simple for such twisted politics. I still love you and rooting for you to give it back to her! \n\n**THE FOUNDATION OF DOLDAM HOSPITAL -**\n\nApart from that whistle blowing entry of &gt;!Kang Dong-Ju oh that entire entry and that scene outside the hotel where we see him board the cab - the entire thing also felt like Kim Sabu's entry in the first 2 seasons. and that entire light on Woo-Jin's face and that hair blowing - over the Top but absolutely enjoyed it! !&lt;\n\nAs much as Kim Sabu hates politics he happens to have the most best solutions and fight against it! &gt;! I loved the whole Kim Sabu and Director Park's scene towards the ending.!&lt;\n\nThe ending with &gt;!Kim Sabu, Kang Dong-Ju and Seo Woo-Jin stanind together gave the feels of 'pillars of Doldam' Loved that shot. Cannot wait to see how the chemistry between Woo-Jin and Dong-Ju unfolds. !&lt;\n\nABSOLUTELY THRILLED FOR NEXT WEEK\ud83d\ude0d\n\nSpecial mention to Dr. Jang - that man made real progression and I loved how he was about to say I'm not on duty but one look and he sang a song before saying Yes - Loved it\ud83e\udd2d \n\nSame goes for Dr. Lee absolutely loved his crocks left behind cute moment.",

He is just blatantly using his authority most times. &gt;!I mean just like the Lung patient mother's - even the assemblywoman Koo wants an apology and honestly agreed as soon as a doctor apologies the court cases become even easier but atleast show the remose. Try understanding the person in front of you. listen to them rather than just giving out orders or big ethic laced lectures. He does the same with his very daughter, he did the same with Insu when he wasn't ready to read that Insu was vulnerable and with the rest of the doctors. !&lt;\n\nI mean he came to the hospital and wanted to take away everything from Kim Sabu and then got busy playing his mental chess ready to downplay everyone else. And I'm not saying that &gt;!the CS resident committed suicide because of him. or he had a hand in it. !&lt;   It's too directly pointing at him and I think there's a twist awaiting there however yet he seems like a bully to me and honestly he should be away from the hospital. \n\nDirector Park - not gonna lie I loved watching him today. &gt;!he's gotten into the game now and he played all his moves right. so that was fun. I just hope he doesn't go against Kim Sabu. I'm liking their team and I'm excited to watch a little tension between them but nothing more please.(Plus we literally 11 episodes in I don't think I need this arc for the rest of 5 episode\ud83d\ude2d) Moreover I understand why Director Park is doing so just like I understand Kim Sabu's stance on all of this. !&lt;\n\nI know Asian parents are very nosy and like to have a certain say in their children's life but what Eun-Jae's mom did straight out toxic :\\]\n\nThe entire episode had many cliffhanger kinda moments - I was like oh is the episode coming to end? Nope another 30 so minutes left. \n\nSo who's coming? &gt;!I wanna places my bet on Kang Dong-Joo !&lt; but I think I'm getting way far ahead of myself!\n\nAlso Also When Dr.Moon said that Woo-Jin needs to wait for another couple of weeks to perform surgeries I was like either he performing one in this very episode or in tomorrow's \ud83d\ude02 let's see if I'm wrong or not!\ud83d\ude02\n\nI want more of S2 Eun-Jae bold and taking a stance this Eun-jae is too not the Eun-jae!\n\nNot gonna believe the preview but very excited for tomorrow!",

He had received caution from Master Kim and CJM about the assemblywoman, I\u2019m only disappointed that when he spoke to her, he didn\u2019t catch on to her betrayal soon enough and still displayed the shock on his face. He was smarter than this! Guess politicians will always be politicians, be it in Seoul or the rural cities. Come on Dir Park, you\u2019ve done well this season! Do better!\n\nSomeone wrote, and I agree. Can we stop with the CEJ crying scenes now? I dunno what the writers have in store now, but since CJM has left and the 2 sons are now in Doldam, let\u2019s give the poor girl a rest and let the boys fight it out. If you can\u2019t write a better storyline for her, then don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make her cry every episode. \n\nDr Bae. Who are you? What are you? Why are you? When will we get more back story on you? Or do we have to wait for S4? Will there be a S4? Or a spin-off called Dr Bones? \n\nNurse Park. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcyou\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcbetter\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcbuck\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcup\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc Btw, have you ever thought of becoming a doctor? You fared pretty well in the collapsed building while tending to the victims and SWJ. \n\nMaster Kim. Will your ex-gf come back into the picture? Remember the posters for this season, there was a shot of your framed photo on the table. Wonder if that means anything? Maybe you will rest your hand and go join her?

His character arc gave a more realistic POV of doctors and what they face in their careers nowadays. Sure, he did have shortcomings and his priorities were awry but no one is perfect. Also  I liked how he gave that comparison of his generation vs youngsters to Seo Woo Jin. I wish he would still make some appearance in the nxt episodes. Maybe for the wedding? Lol",

We needed someone who\u2019s an ally of KSB and Doldam, but at the same time, not a fanatic \u2018yes-man\u2019 of KSB. Because what kind of leader would that be, if someone is so much a disciple of KSB that he would take all KSB\u2019s opinion as gold?

I was shaking with rage when her mom had the audacity to &gt;!tell Eun Jae to stop humiliating her after she found out that they were living together. Like, excuse me?!?!?! Humilate you?! Just like Eun Jae retailated by saying that she moved out and therefore independent from her mom- her mom should also be independent from Eun Jae now.

When Kim Sabu and CJM were arguing about the role of a doctor, I couldn't help but kind of side with CJM on this one. Kim Sabu's argument of sense of duty as a doc is correct and ideal, but I feel most doctors eventually gravitate over to valuing their dignity as a doctor that CJM mentions. \n\nI didn't expect the meeting between Kang Dong Joo and Seo Woo Jin to be so tense!

He was in a similar boat and look how he turned out. I think people are too focused on CJM's wrong mindset instead of appreciating how incredibly complex his character was. A character like CJM isn't there to make you like them, and that's the beauty of it.\n\nI really appreciate that both PMG and CJM didn't end up being villains that could never be convinced to challenge their own beliefs, watching CJM in specific made it seem like I was getting to know a real, living person, instead of just watching fictional characters act out their roles within the confines of 4 walls.\n\nJust because I don't agree with his views on issues doesn't mean he was a weak character. I was able to enjoy him in the drama because he offered a new perspective and he wasn't completely blind with his own beliefs. He had a potential for change which is not something you see everyday in kdramas.",

However I can\u2019t help but feel that what he did to CJM was so unfair. CJM did mention that he had conservative and orthodox methods in the first episode. It would be a shame if CJM has to step down after Director Park\u2019s plan today and if his association with Sangmin\u2019s death was indeed just speculation.\n\nMoreover, since so far the writers decided to ignore CEJ, I can\u2019t imagine the negative impact it would have on her - to see her father step down due to false accusations. And I wonder if it would complicate things for her further (i mean I\u2019m sure it would). Overall, like everyone else, I\u2019m rooting for CEJ and hoping the writers do justice to her character. \n\nLastly, I love SWJ but can they stop making him the centre of everything already. Even in today\u2019s episode he was the one who figured out the sandwich pack \ud83d\ude2d",

I hope they take the opportunity to utilise CEJ better, she's an enormously interesting character with a lot more potential. 'Stuck between her love for her father and her boyfriend' is an arc that has been done so many times before, and she seems to become more buried with all these powerful characters around her.\n\nBut then again, how do you compete with a character who faced a terrorist by himself, went down under a collapsing building, solved cases on top of being a world class surgeon? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Talk about plot armour.\n\nHope they are able to redeem her because there's so much potential there!",

Dr. Park started as the bad guy but was eventually brought over to the \"good side\" by Kim Sabu. In the last episode, he chose to stay and Doldam separated itself from the main Seoul hospital so that they could build a trauma center in three years. The same issue of dismantling Doldam Hospital to build something else just came up again in Seas 3.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Seo Woo Jin was hounded by loan sharks and struggled to make ends meet. He said he only needed to make money but was a tough, very principled guy. Kim Sabu brought out the good doctor in him and helped him heal his wounds. His parents died in a murder-suicide because of debt and he was the only survivor. The boss of the loan sharks happened to be Dr. Bae (Bones) father and Dr. Bae who is very nerdy and sweet had escaped Seoul to start fresh in the countryside. Woo Jin had been in love with Chae Eun Jae since med school but was too messed up to do anything about it until the end of the season.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Cha Eun Jae was forced by her mother to become a Dr and puked/fainted in the OR. Was sent to Doldam as punishment, but really it was all orchestrated by Kim Sabu to \"fix her\". I now assume he must have known she was Cha Jin Man's daughter, but this point was never made clear in any of the series. In season 2 she finally was able to do surgery, stood up to her mom, and became her own person deciding to stay at Doldam.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Areum saw Kim Sabu in the main hospital ER and was fascinated by him so she applied for a job. She was uncertain about her skills but grew a lot. Eun Tak pursued her hard which makes it so frustrating this season but it was established before that Eun Tak is jealous and quiet and not really good at expressing his feelings. He was involved with gang members until he ended up at the hospital and became a nurse after meeting Kim Sabu.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Eun Tak and most of the others were there in Seas 1 and 2 so they'll be very excited to see Kang Dong Joo who is very intense as Kim Sabu said. He was the brilliant but messed up fellow in Seas 1 that needed to be guided by Kim Sabu to deal with his wounds.!&lt;\n\nHope this helps.",

He is not *that* good of a doctor and they were doing just fine before.\n* Dr. Jang, you bitch. Stop hitting on Ah-reum!\n* Damn, I hate Cha Eun-jae's mother \ud83d\ude44\n* This entire fuss about Seo Woo-jin and Cha Eun-jae living together is really annoying but we asians are very conservative so it makes sense...\n* Eun-tak will definitely get jealous, Ah-reum \ud83d\ude02\n* Okay... As much as he's annoying, I think what Dr. Jang did for that patient was impressive. Also, Eun-tak is getting jealous... again. I told you \ud83d\ude02\n* OMG. Who put that &gt;!blood-stained pen!&lt; on Dr. Cha Jin-man's table? Director Park?\n* First Eun-tak, now Dr. Ung. Grandma be collecting all the handsome Doldam men \ud83d\ude02\n* You're telling me that it was &gt;!Dr. Ung?!!&lt;\n* &gt;!OMG DIRECTOR PARK IS PLAYING DIRTY.!&lt;\n\nI must say that previous season was much better than current one in terms of writing. There is barely any romance this season and they're ignoring Cha Eun-jae.\n\nI don't understand why Lee Sung-kyung agreed to join this season... I assume it was probably because of how popular the previous season was but she barely does anything and is mostly treated as Seo Woo-jin's lover. It's all about Kim Sabu and Seo Woo-jin, you take Cha Eun-jae's character out and the show will still be same.",

I'll bet scenes scripted for her were left out. \n\nAlso barely there are Bae Moon Jung, who has no plot for himself, not even as a side interest to Areum, and Dr Yang, who's now funny and almost endearing.",

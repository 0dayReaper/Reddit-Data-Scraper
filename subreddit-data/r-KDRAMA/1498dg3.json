The series are over and it was a satisfying end to a less than satisfying show.\n\nI watched it all the way through, first because I am a sucker for friends to lovers tropes. And second, I intellectually understood where this drama was trying to go. I understood the story it was trying to tell - about this David vs Goliath struggle of an ordinary worker vs an enormous unfeeling corporation. And this moral story of righteousness triumphing over ineptitude, complacency and corruption.\n\nThe individual characters in another show might have worked but here somehow it was like my cooking in my twenties. I had all the right ingredients and still, it tastes a bit off.\n\nI stuck through with it and am glad because I liked the ending and I liked the FL. Would I recommend it...no. would I watch it again... no.",

She *nailed* the performance. It was my first glimpse of her, and soon after, I watched **The Legend of the Blue Sea** and loved her in that, although it was 2FL so a little easier.\n\nHer comedic timing is fire and I'm going to look for more of her work!",

Their bodies get switched for magical reasons. \n\n**Good Things** Stars a young Hyun Bin. Premise is interesting and handled well. Scene where FL in ML\u2019s body realizes she needs to pee and will have to handle his bodily needs is hilarious, as is when she has to teach him how to put on a bra - he only knows how to take them off. FL is independent and strong person. \n\n**Bad Things** Casual misogyny is icky. Even the FL\u2019s stuntman boss doesn\u2019t want her working for him because she\u2019s female. Story drags a bit in places. Ending has some dumb aspects, like &gt;! Why do FL/ML let their kids see the evil mother in law? !&lt;\n\n**Interesting Things** Did I say young Hyun Bin? Also note where ML lives because you\u2019ll definitely see that house again in other dramas (What\u2019s Wrong With Secretary Kim, Love in Contract, +more).\n\n**Spotlight On** It has Hyun Bin, plus female stuntwoman is interesting career to depict in a drama. It\u2019s pretty good considering its age. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Tale of Nokdu** ML is &gt;! royal prince !&lt; who doesn\u2019t know it, raised on an island but goes to find more information about his origins. He infiltrates a women-only village by posing as a female. FL discovers his gender secret and hides/helps him while an enemies-to-lovers relationship develops. Villain causes havoc and kills a lot of people. \n\n**Good Things** This is an overall well done drama. Great chemistry between FL/ML, interesting story, lots of comedic value to the gender swap but not over the top. \n\n**Bad Things** Adoptive little sister of ML is *very* annoying. \n\n**Interesting Things** Lots of charming side characters, and the female assassin guild is a really interesting concept. Strong female power for sageuk setting despite oppression. \n\n**Spotlight On** because it\u2019s really good and more people should watch it. It\u2019s not often a drama deals with gender, has strong comedic and serious elements, has good acting and production, resolves the ending well, and is just overall good. It doesn\u2019t hit some of the intense high notes of greatness but it\u2019s very solid.\n\n[Mydramalist](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/4mykdramalifestyle)",

What does ML think when pushing FL in a tiny fitting room (which is already weird considering it's an expensive shop). He's forgiven because he's used to get his way and probably frustrated to be out of his comfort zone. And i guess he is behaving to what is expecting from a male gender",

Underwhelming villains.\n* **Interesting Things:**  - Multiple hidden identities. Nice twists on 2nd, 3rd ML's and SFL.

Spirited, violent woman defender of the downtrodden whups butt. Lead couple have super chemistry, and their parts and dialogue are beautifully written. Excellent enemies to lovers with plenty of ingenious misunderstandings that spring from character and don't go on too long. Great physical slapstick. Sprightly ensemble with marvelous secondary and minor character actor moments. Particularly excellent crop of buffoonish entertainment lawyers. The ML's sneering in early episodes is chef's kiss. Snappy, well paced, and completely resolved in 10 episodes. I love the way kdramas test the relationship with last minute crises, and this particular crisis is one of my favorites of all time, because it's meaningful and unavoidable, and takes the leads and their relationship to a new level. I think of the ending as \\[happy versus unhappy limited ending spoiler\\] &gt;!not open ended but rather leaving room for possibility, and to me it's unequivocally happy.!&lt;\n\n**Bad Things** \\- The sexism, sex-negativity, and double standard that make drama themes like this alive and necessary!\n\n**Interesting Things** \\- A toxic parent-child relationship is depicted without the usual veil of filial piety. The FL's dad is a terrible jerk, and the drama doesn't make excuses for him. Plus the FL is proven to be righteous in rejecting him and leaving her parents' home even though she isn't married, in the first episode.\n\n**Spotlight On Because** \\- The drama's major theme is gender double standard. It tackles it head on by depicting an FL who has slept with a large number of men to whom she felt little or no emotional detachment, handles a car like a racecar driver, and is an extremely athletic and skilled street fighter. And yeah, there are consequences. The characters fight back with bravery, ingenuity, love, and by confronting society's stupid \"morality.\"",

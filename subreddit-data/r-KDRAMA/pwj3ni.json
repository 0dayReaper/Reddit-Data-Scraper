We suggest that our users err on the side of caution and use spoiler tags abundantly for major plot points (e.g. deaths, birth secrets, ending). This applies for both currently airing and aired dramas since not everyone has watched everything. Reply to this comment once you have added appropriate spoiler tags for review by a mod.\n\nIn Markdown, use  &gt; ! spoiler ! &lt; without spaces for &gt;!spoiler!&lt;.

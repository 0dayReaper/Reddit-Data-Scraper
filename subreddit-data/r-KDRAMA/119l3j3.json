Yeon Jin tried to threaten her again, slapped her, pretty much acting like the teenager she never left behind. Dong Eun knows how to deal with all of them, but Jaejun seems almost unaffected by her. \n\nHe hits her where it hurts her the most. He mocks her scars, touches her without her consent, blows on her scars. He's cynical and cold. And he knows what to do to get to her. And that messes her up. She's great at mind games, but so is he. His abuse is more psychological than anything, imo. \n\nI also think that r**e on top of everything else would be a tad too much. She's traumatized enough \ud83d\ude14 (But it is possible though. I wouldn't put it past him).",

Even Yeonjin seems to be on eggshells around him, like after he choked her and she kissed him with her eyes open, clearly giving in to his desires to stay safe. \n\nUnlike Myeongo, he's simmering with barely contained rage all the time. And because he has money, power, and, well, is a man, he can get away with just about anything. I hope Yeonjin's husband helps take him down because I'm not sure Dongeun can do it alone.",

Its been Netflix\u2019 formula for years that have done pretty well for easy to binge shows that they release in one go (Squid Game, All of Us are Dead, Hellbound, Stranger Things, Bridgerton, etc.).   \n\n\nThey should have stuck with the formula of 10 episodes for Netflix originals rather than breaking up 16 episodes (the usual Kdrama formula) in two parts. If they really wanted 16 episodes, they should have released it per episode like EAW (But that\u2019s not a Netflix Original).  It\u2019s the fault of the creator who wanted to tell a long story rather than a shorter one. S1 had a lot of fluff that could have been cut down.  Perhaps blame KES.",

They should have released it all at once, those that binged season 1 would have binged season 2 as well if they did.",

Directors who have worked with Hye Kyo complimented her a lot exactly because of this: they tell her how they want the scene to play out, what kind of emotional response they want from her, and she executes their vision perfectly. And she's also constantly trying to improve herself and bring new ideas for her scenes/characters. She appears to be extremely professional.",

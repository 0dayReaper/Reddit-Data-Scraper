A LOT in these two eps.\n\n&gt;!The goodbye hike with them was so layered for me. Contrast it to Minyoung breaking up with him when he resented her for doing it on a hike and ruining his hobby. Whereas with Woojoo - every memory, even a painful one like a break-up, was something to be cherished. He WANTED their last time together to be going on his favorite trail. His line - \"You gave me everything. Support. Consolation. Love. You gave me everything\" has me tearing up AGAIN just writing it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I hate forced separation tropes. So, the one year later screen frustrated me. However, this is one of the few ones where time and distance may have been necessary to let her family work through their stuff.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!At first I was angry that there was radio silence for an entire year. That he had essentially dropped off the face of the earth (to work with the Kang camper guy! They actually set that up well lol). But then they wove in all these things to make you realize that Woojoo and Dongjin never dared to directly reach out together but they kept trying to run into each other. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I like that we had a moment showing each family member support her. The mom apparently had been communicating with Dongjin and even told him she'd make him food any time he needed (welcome to the family).. Older sister is the one who told this to Woojoo to tell her there's no reason to stay apart. And finally Jigu who kept his word and really did wish him a happy new year/keep in touch invited them to run into each other.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The end shot of her just running to him with abandon was so cathartic and lovely. Finally, I like that we have no clue what's up with Heeja and that he has Daehong in his phone as \"father\". I cried so much y'all.!&lt;",

It\u2019s cute that the mom and Jigu were both in contact with Han Donjin but let\u2019s bfrrrl, if my family members can still talk to my ex, then why can I not be with my man?! I\u2019m happy HS mentioned that, but it didn\u2019t have to be a whole year. \n\nAlso, I loved the ending, but like someone mentioned on here, I would\u2019ve loved if they solved the family issues in episode 15. If they still wanted a time jump then they could\u2019ve had it at the beginning of episode 16 so we could have seen more of the udon couple for the last episode. The last five minutes wasn\u2019t enough for me, but still, I\u2019m very happy for the ending. No complaints here\u2026kind of\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

I love how DJ no long carries his torn backpack around!!! He has finally gotten rid of the unnecessary baggage in his life! I also loved the party scene in the office.. That party banner congratulating him on becoming a free man said so much! I felt like it represented the moment when DJ realise that he can finally be freed from all the unwanted responsibilities and guilt. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d (Why does he have such a horrible narcissistic mother!!! So much karma in this last episode on her!!)\n\nAlso I loved how the Sim\u2019s house have had furniture/ decoration updates which showed how much effort they put into making that house their home again. From the new sofa, cupboards to the childhood photos that are now carefully framed up and they even went to take a new family studio photo!! There\u2019s even potted flowers in the garden now!!\n\nI also realised that DJ had never changed his phone number at all. So I\u2019m kinda confused why Soo Hee and WJ said that they didn\u2019t hear from him. But I guess that could be because of fear that\u2019s preventing her from contacting him. \n\nI\u2019m not really convinced about &gt;!Jun and HS\u2019s love relationship. It feels more platonic rather than romantic. But I guess the director might have wanted to portray that kind of love rather than a passionate love relationship.\ud83d\ude05!&lt;\n\nAlso in the last scene &gt;!where WJ ran to DJ!&lt; I was wondering what was going through LSK\u2019s mind. That kind of laughter on her face shows the real life closeness that she has with KYK! She looks so comfortable with him. I was wondering if that last scene was scripted or it just happened cuz LSK was feeling cheeky. In her interviews she said she\u2019s actually always playing around and making people laugh so this role was actually very difficult for her as she had to portray someone that was very depressed and serious all the time. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 But it turned out well!\n\nHow did the rest of you find the finale? Was it satisfactory for you? I just wished we had a hotter ending.. \ud83d\ude02",

I really like your correlation of the backpack and baggage. \n\nJun &amp; HS have that kind of relationship of them knowing each other for so long, they know how each other works and are using that to balance the temperament of what they have going. HS although she is the oldest, she has a \u201cmagical/Disney-ish\u201d view on romance and Jun (out of all her past situationships) knows how to work with that. The scene on the couch when they are talking after dinner, you can see a shift in how Jun talks with her. When things get \u201cheated\u201d I\u2019m sure they get it going. I think they are good.",

He has finally gotten rid of the unnecessary baggage in his life!\n\nbit late to the finale, as i finished watching just now.\n\ni feel like the styling in the show, especially for the main characters, was so good and very intentional as the series progressed, where you can actually see their mental state reflected in what they were wearing.\n\nmaybe it's been said before, but i noticed throughout the show, WJ's bags going from that real big tote she had at the begining - in the funeral scene, to the black messenger bag - when she was changing her mind about DJ and started having feelings and at the end that brown purse she wore to the concert, which was significantlly smaller. \n\ni felt like it symbolised the same for her, the bags were the amount of hate she was carrying around. at first for her dad and heeja, then as she started interacting more with DJ, the bag changed based on their interaction and her perception of him ( she had the messenger bag until they met at the supermarket in ep 2 and he told her he's not interested in other people's misery and next scene back to the big tote bag)\n\nit clicked that maybe it wasn't just a random styling choice after the talk she had with Heeja about letting go.",

            "comment": "I was so tired last night that I sped through the episodes to see how the show ended and then watched them again today. This entire drama was so well done!\n\nEverybody commented on how well-written and acted this show is but I have also been obsessed with the cinematography and the director's framing of characters that made it feel like an indie movie. From the \"confusing\" pink/gray filters at the beginning, color became the ultimate representation of mood for the characters. Once they broke out of the \"pink period\" the yellows and reds started showing up as their feelings increased then adding the vibrant greens as Dong Jin got back to nature (hope/peace). Yellow means love and growth hence yellow umbrellas being very popular in dramas when characters get together. When the colors became more vivid, maybe halfway through, I started noticing that there would always be a red detail in the background whenever Dong Jin and Woo Joo were together. It was often a bright red neon line on some building that during the finale reminded me of the red string of fate that binds lovers in fantasy dramas. \n\nIt was too consistent not to be intentional. Even the clothing colors followed their moods and I was so glad to see Dong Jin's light gray suit at the very end as a complete change from his usual black.\n\nAnother detail was the composition of the shots, with the characters being often off center. Sometimes off center showing them getting closer to each other, but not yet together, like when they would frame one person to the left of the screen and the other to the right, but still in separate shots.\n\nI will literally have to watch this show again just to see what they do with the colors and frames. It was masterfully done to contribute to the mood.",

Absolutely loved this gem of a show!\n\nKYK and LSK take a bow! Played their characters to perfection and added depth when it could easily have gone flat. \n\n&gt;!\u201dTell me what\u2019s going through your mind?\u201d!&lt;, he is always the only one that asks her that and I love that she returns that consideration with honesty. I adored that scene so much. \n\nI would say the writers went in for a slow, smooth and measured landing, and to that end I\u2019m thoroughly satisfied with how it turned out (15 was slower and could\u2019ve been crisper but for a show that did not produce one bad episode it honestly made no major difference). &gt;!Could I do with a WHOLE ass episode of them just smiling at each other? YES GOD PLEASE, but I understand from a creative perspective and arc perspective this was the most satisfying way they could\u2019ve handled it.!&lt;. To overcome anger, sadness, guilt and reclaim your sense of self is hard and takes time, and the fact that they &gt;!stayed within orbit and not like a complete wipe off the face of the earth situation, I think they understood that!&lt; love doesn\u2019t go away or disappears while you\u2019re working on yourself, and sometimes you need a minute. At least that\u2019s how I viewed the use of the &gt;!\u201dforced separation\u201d trope.!&lt;. \n\nI absolutely ADORED how &gt;!LSY was finally allowed to simply let go and be herself and not Woojoo in the last few seconds!&lt;. That\u2019s genuine pure joy there for both the character and a job well done. Beautifully shot!  \n\nFor a show to make you feel physically lighter after seeing the characters get through such a rough time of your life is not easy and I\u2019m so grateful for that. There\u2019s enough bleakness in the world and we don\u2019t need more of it. \n\nThe brightness to contrast how he was feeling at the moment &gt;!in the balloons and everything for his farewell was so bittersweet that THAT got the most tears out of me!&lt;. I loved his staff, I loved his office, loved Ms. Baek. \n\nAlso Joon and Haesung wearing the &gt;!same colour scheme of clothes when they decide to give it a go!&lt; was such a symbolic way of showing that they were finally on the same page. I know there\u2019ve been mixed reactions to them but I actually really really loved that Jun consistently stayed as a friend to Woojoo and that we &gt;!finally got his take on how they became friends in the first place!&lt;. Joon was a very nicely done character as well. \n\nEverything about this show was done so bloody thoughtfully. \n\nSupport. Consolation. Love.\n\nIt really is all we ever need. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c",

I put off ep 13 &amp; 14 because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it if it had a bad ending but I\u2019m glad it proved otherwise. I have so much love for these two characters that I feel so much relief when they finally truly smiled at the end. \n\nA couple thoughts: \n- &gt;!Their breakup scene at the hiking trail was so bittersweet. \u201cThe love you gave me was greater than the pain\u201d holy shit if it\u2019s not the most heartbreaking line ever!&lt;\n- both actors are SO good at acting with their eyes. It was so painful just seeing the two of them speak about/to each other with tears brimming in their eyes \n- the mom is one of the best mothers I\u2019ve ever seen portrayed in kdramas. She\u2019s not one dimensional and there are so many times when she could\u2019ve fallen into the normal makjang cliches but she never did \n- &gt;!DJ putting daehong as \u2018father\u2019 in his phone is so precious and lovely. I\u2019m so happy that he was the parental figure he had until the very end and absolutely no last min redemption or mention of heeja!&lt;\n- &gt;!them not reaching out to each other during the one year of separation but always finding reasons to try to run into each other is very in character for both of them and proved just how much they still loved/thought about each other while still being able to move on with their lives in other respects!&lt;\n- &gt;!I\u2019m not a big fan of the HS x Joon relationship but their moments were cute at the end. I\u2019m a little bitter that they got such a prolonged ending and our leads didn\u2019t but whatever lol on that note I\u2019m also a little peeved that WJ\u2019s sacrifices for her family was never truly called out or appreciated openly by her siblings. I get that there are nuances to their relationships and roles within the family but WJ sacrificed her life, future and love for her family and everyone seemingly just went on with their lives and had their happy endings except for her. It wasn\u2019t even until HS gave her final support that I feel like WJ could feel like she could pursue the one relationship that actually put her first but whatever I digress!&lt; \n\nSo many more moments to call out but this will do for now. This was such a fun and thrilling ride. LSK and KYK had one of the best chemistry I\u2019ve ever seen and I will be replaying that kiss/bed scene in the future.",

It felt like so much dialogue was replaced purely through the way they looked at each other. So well done.\n\nThe drama managing to evoke sympathy for both Minyoung and Heeja really drove in how forgiving everyone had become by the end of the show. \n\nAlso Jigu is one of my favourite characters - just a younger brother doing youngest things while trying to feel out his siblings. I liked how he got along with Dongjin and how they effectively cultivated that sibling relationship between the two of them.",

One year isn't nearly long enough for 2 people who's been depressed for decades to be so playful right. It's more like the real lsk and kwk IRL to me. I'm surprised the director with all her scenes being so measured would let them break character at the end but I can't see it any other way. Also I feel indignant after 16 eps of them suffering we only get 10 seconds of them being happy. I was hoping at least a camping scene or a siblings scene with DJ and his new found family and WJ finally laughing at least. Even sunwoo and the ex got a tad longer \"happiness\" than that.  I don't really feel the story line of Jun and HS at all either but they also got more happy times than our udon couple. Anyways I like how food is their love language in the Sim family: WJ to DJ, mom to DJ, Sigu and Jun too.",

It was almost as if it was supposed to end when they were smiling at each other and the director have said cut but the camera was still rolling and they decided to add that scene instead.\n\nOr maybe they took some alternative ending\nshots and that one was chosen.",

Made me wonder if it was really the characters or just a behind the scenes that they decided to keep at the end. While I did exclaim with happiness, it left me a bit confused again. Would have been far better had Dongjin hugged her then, but playfully running away? That was Kim Youngkwan, not Dongjin. I feel so picky hahaha but it really bothered me. Not the best decision the director made.\n\nI really shouldn\u2019t complain though! I\u2019m so happy that they made it obvious that they\u2019re choosing to stay together. Instead of like an open ending, or god forbid, a sad ending.",

It's been awhile since I've felt completely satisfied with a kdrama's ending or last few eps and this totally delivered. It was so beautiful that last scene is going down as maybe one of my favorites ever. \n\nI could write an essay about all the symbolism, foreshadowing, parallels, and little moments they gave us and life lessons about pain, regret, love, hatred, forgiveness... but I'll spare you all hahaa. \n\nIt was so profound, yet a simple of a portrayal of ordinary (sad/broken) people in normal life. I love that they kept the tone of the drama the same from beginning to end - slow and steady (I hate when the ML/FL suddenly change personality when they get together or are annoying to watch around ep 11-16). I love that even the music stayed hopeful even as they were getting closure or learning how to move forward. There was SO much hope woven into this story of a family's brokenness and how they all found healing/new dreams for their life. I could totally feel for each character by the end of it and there wasn't a single unnecessary filler scene. \n\nI love all the screentime our main leads got (we basically had angst for 16 eps lol) knowing they were constantly thinking about each other the whole drama and no other side plots. Ahhh I will recommend this drama for any lover of love.",

The cinematography, symbolism, the writing, the acting, the excruciating wait for each episodes on a Wednesday! I was captivated by the growth of our leads and watching the build-up of their love. I also thoroughly enjoyed reading everyone's thoughts and analysis of each episode, both here and on MDL and Dramabeans.\n\nAs for these last two eps, I was anxious towards how it would end. Although we see &gt;!Jun and Haesung together at the end, I would've been fine if they stayed as friends.!&lt; Everything seemed to have wrapped up nicely, but I would like more clarification for the final scene. Can we &gt;!infer that the last shot of Woojoo and Dongjin means they end up together again? That they are finally free from their burdens and can just be together??!&lt;\n\nI was super invested in this couple, far more than I can remember from any other show. As a previous post mentioned, I love the way the show explores different types of love. I'll definitely rewatch in the future and save the OST and background songs to a playlist. I will miss the Wednesday waits :'( but this year is promising for other kdramas, just gotta be on the lookout for what's coming next.\n\nAlso for those who kept up every week: &gt;!we're no longer haunted by the stills of ep.16 with the episode summary, we're free! lol!&lt;\n\nLastly, some may call this show slow, some may call it pink overload, and maybe some may call it boring. But I would still call it love (corny, I know)",

Also, shoutout to the actors, they all did an amazing job! \n\nThat being said, I really wish someone in WJ family had spoken with her sooner about DJ and how he is not his mother, but his own person and that it was okay to love him. A year felt like way too much time for them to realize that WJ also deserves love and happiness after everything that happened.",

Still some questions linger even though it might be a picky from my POV \n\n1:  I found there was 0 reason for Hee Ja to send her late husbands will to her ex husband. Just as easily as she could\u2019ve easily threw it away and kept the house without anyone finding out, I just found it especially weird for someone to send their ex husband an especially valuable will when there was many other ways to dispose of it.\n\n2: I also found it especially weird for Hee Ja\u2019s scammer boyfriend  to have a change of tune and just straight up confess about her crimes when it implicated himself along with it. From the start we saw how he wasn\u2019t really a trustworthy person and knew he was just in it for the money. For his character to just suddenly feel \u201cguilty\u201d without really any financial benefits and turn both them in was just a total 360 from his character.\nThis was probably more of a plot armor to try and serve her Justice when Woo Joo\u2019s family refused to buy I just found this weird. \n\nAgain these questions might just be picky from my POV but still I thought that this show was great in depicting how 2 people can help overcome each others traumas.",

Particularly loved their breakup walk in the forest. It\u2019s so heartwarming for two people to be as open as they are to each other, telling exactly how they felt about each other and what the other means to them. \n\nI also just need to commend again about how understated everything in the show is, the clothes, the houses, everything \u2014 yet you feel so much for everyone and their stories. Each frames, scenes, characters, even supporting role has room to breathe and react, nobody and nothing is taken for granted as 2D filler. I hope more show runners are taking cue out of this show. \n\nMy absolute comfort show, I will definitely be coming back to this again and again\ud83d\udc97",

A lot of dramas I've watched peaked by episode 8-11 and then all tension is lost and a new plotline is pushed to try to regain it but it just doesn't feel the same. !&lt;\n\nThe way  'intertwined' the romance between the leads, Woo-joo &gt;! hiding secrets from Dong-jin and her family !&lt; kept the drama tight throughout all the episodes so far.\n\nProof that common troupes/stories that had been done plenty of times can be interesting when executed right, &gt;! without being overly fluffy/cheesy on the romantic side or makjang-ish on the revenge side!&lt;\n\nEDIT: after watching both episodes: liked the final I guess it will not be everyone's cup of tea due to &gt;! everyone having an explicit/lengthy closure but the main couple !&lt;  but I'm glad it ended the way it ended because &gt;! for quiet a bit during episode 16 I thought the ending might have gotten 'On Your Wedding Day''d !&lt;",

I spent all of episode 15 hoping the conflict would wrap up and we\u2019d get a happy episode, then I spent virtually all of episode 16 waiting for the same, and even had a moment of doubt in the last few minutes. Even when I should have been happy for Haesung and Jun I was just itching to fast forward.. and then for what? They got a thousand percent better send off than our leads!! But anyways.. feel a little robbed by the ending. What i\u2019d give for a nearly full hour of happiness as in CCIR. But yeah, I enjoyed the slow burn of their romance but I wanted a payoff. I guess the payoff was the kiss and sleepover in episode 12. The show peaked then. Maybe I\u2019m just not appreciating the art that was being created but yes.. we deserved more at the end.!&lt;",

She should have told him about 5 episodes ago, they should have had at least one episode dedicated to the development of the sister and the friends relationship, then one episode for the resolution of the ML and FL relationship, then the last episode, the happy ever after. I think the friend and the sister seemed to have a better ending as they had the more normal relationship plus they had know each other for so long, it was bound to happen sooner but it did feel like we had so much angst for so long to have very little happeniness in the end, too many unnecessary scenes.",

I've been a lee sung Kyung fan for a while now but I hadn't vibed with the ML in secret life of my secretary but after watching this drama and Somebody I realised that the actor is not to blame at all , that  drama just wasn't well written and he has so much range and I also have developed a liking for loser like MLs . \n\nThe only character I disliked was the older sister ,she was a pick me through out the drama and it was annoying she never properly acknowledged the sacrifices her sister made for them . I wished she had a bit more character development . \n\nThe mom was the real Star , she was classy and graceful and so very fair . She didn't treat Ml badly just cause of his mum which I appreciated .\n\nThe brother was a bit too immature . I understand that it can be unfair to have your families expectations placed on you but Woojoo literally skipped college to fund his studies.  A little gratefulness would have been nice . It sucks to be the responsible sibling who is being practical and realistic and being treated like you're harsh/cruel . This may just be me projecting so I'll not take this assessment seriously.  \n\nYoon Jun was the GOAT . I really appreciate they didn't make him fall in love with Woojoo but the older sister did annoy me with the whole I don't want to compete with my younger sis stichk . Jun was exemplary tho . \n\nThe affair partner's lack of awareness was kinda jarring to me . Even if she was not remorseful it would have been nicer to see her realise that she was in fact doing wrong . I love a good retribution and was waiting for the revenge part but it turned out to be pretty mild and nice.  \n\nOverall it was a good drama but I don't think I'll rewatch , due to the extremely slow pacing.",

            "comment": "Binged watched the show last week \u2014 really glad this is possible cos it would be excruciating to wait weekly (kudos to y\u2019all who live-watched it) and compelled to write some thoughts in this last ep thread just to add some RL perspectives as one whose family parallels to a degree the Shim family. TLDR: while every family is different, and culture in a lot of ways also do play a part in behaviors and responses, the portrayal of the family (and Woojoo, oh Woojoo) feels incredibly true-to-life.\n\n(Full disclosure: my dad sorta/kinda cheated, situation is complicated, not elaborating; am Asian so familial values and societal norms are factual; emotional scars and trauma last\u2026 probably will be with me throughout my lifetime even though me and siblings are now successful adults by societal common definition and in our 30-40s; we continue to function as an unparalleled unit when it comes to banding together against \u2018the other family\u2019 even when there\u2019s no more anger) \n\nA scene that stood out in particular is when Woojoo sat across from Heeja and told the woman how the latter had irrevocably changed and destroyed her life; how she can\u2019t take back what she\u2019d lost; how she\u2019d seethed and lived with anger/resentment/baggage for too long not even knowing she carried them until she learned to forgive etc etc \u2014 steely determination in her eyes, refusing to let tears fall until Heeja is out of sight\u2026 oh Woojoo, my dear Woojoo, who had held on and held it together for too long. This scene broke me entirely for Woojoo, her story, and for giving words to the deepest, faintest, wounded parts of my heart that I too, had unearthed when I was in my early 30s - much to my surprise cos I truly believed I understood all that I carried and felt.\n\nI also just wanted to add that although a lot of people didn\u2019t like Haeseong\u2019s behavior and actions in the last few eps - she was fine not acting as \u2018the eldest\u2019 for 14 eps and suddenly changed her tune, and expected everyone to give her the nod and listen to her - I understand it\u2026 but wonder if that comes from more western-centric views. I agree no amount of wrongs or \u2018norms\u2019 make a right but I do find her change in behavior and everyone falling in line very culturally attuned, especially a kdrama with very Korean cultural/societal nuances. A few people also commented it\u2019s rich of the mum, often absent, to suddenly pop up towards the end and be making decisions. I\u2019ve concluded kdramas tend to give mothers too much leverage (in good and bad ways lol) \u2014 this one is a bit of a reach for me too but also makes sense when I place them culturally. To be fair, she was also never informed \u2014 not even about the ex-husband\u2019s passing, so the anger and sadness make sense.\n\nI did feel the show wrapped up some parts tad too neatly (eg the \u2018approval\u2019 by the family a year later for them to get back together if they wanna) but the show has held so many other parts so well\u2026 it\u2019s kinda like [paraphrased] what Dongjin kindly said to Woojoo: the love you gave me were so much more than the pain you intended to inflict.  \u2026Or maybe I\u2019m easy lol I just decided okay I\u2019ll look past these to get to a good end. \n\nFinally, a shoutout cos I don\u2019t see people pointing this out explicitly: the excellent, endearing, and absolutely loving portrayal of found families and friendship in this show between Joon and the Shim siblings. Oh my heart \u2764\ufe0f I love how effortlessly they consider and treat him as one of their own and how he keeps, insisted, and iterated the loyalty between him and Woojoo (this is the kinda ride-or-die friends we want in our lives). I also love and appreciated that the writer gave Joon full dimensions though not gonna lie, it crossed my mind too many times lol that you can\u2019t hire Sungjoon just to have him play wingman and BFF like nope. So phew.\n\nOverall: real gem of a show and solid performance. I\u2019m familiar with all the actors but this show is a real rediscovery of many if not all. Stellar performances by all buoyed by writing/directing that truly carried and uplifted. We won on trifecta. This show will linger long after its end \u2014 as it should.\n\nPS for those looking for similar-but-different show, my immediate recc is My Unfamiliar Family. That one was my 2021 show of the year and both shows, despite their different vibes and plot points, give very similar emotional depth.",

                    "comment": "i interpreted the \u201cfather\u201d scene differently. In earlier episodes, DJ\u2019s friends would joke that Uncle Daehong was their father and DJ always said that he\u2019s the only man out of all of Heeja\u2019s men that he acknowledged. So I interpreted it as him realising that Daehong has always been a father figure to him. I don\u2019t think Uncle Daehong and his mum would have gotten back together as you could see from the earlier episodes how much distaste he has for Heeja and he was actually not taking any of her BS talk. I thought that perhaps the show not depicting her in any of the last moments showed that she actually was sentenced. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd no\u2026 I believe WJ really enjoyed her job. In the earlier episode after she left DJ\u2019s company, she was actually searching for jobs and one of the job that she stopped at was at an exhibition firm. Also her friend remarked how happy she looked when working! So I felt the last episode showed how WJ finally found her calling in events and exhibition.",

I enjoyed all the interactions and  the boistrous times, the family closeness, etc. There were lots of people and plot lines and things happening, and then it deteriorated into a sad, depressing show that dragged the last episodes, in my opinion.\n I just have to have something that moves a little faster, I guess. I mean, they kept plodding back-and-forth and dragging everything out to fill 16 episodes. I just felt so impatient at the stupidity of the fact that the mother seemed just fine with him and then  it took a year for the sister to come around and it was  kind of a pointless rushed ending in a way. The last second, she runs over to him almost out of the shot?  I definitely like a show with better pacing than this. I just finished watching an older K drama that I really enjoyed called Fight for My Way.",

            "comment": "I mostly really loved this drama. Both leads were incredible, it was gorgeously filmed, and it was an interesting exploration of revenge and how to move on (or not) when you've been hurt by someone. \n\nThe last four or so episodes stressed me out and frustrated me. First, I initially couldn't fully understand why Woo Joo didn't confess to Dong Jin about the house sooner after Sun Woo confronted her. In retrospect, I think this did make some sense. Even though I believe Woo Joo knew in her heart that Dong Jin would be understanding, I think she also knew her family *would not* be. \n\nThe family (my frustration here may be more a cultural ignorance rather than with the writing, not sure). I went from really liking Hye Seong as a quirky, flawed person I was rooting for to hating her for hypocrisy and selfishness. It bothered me that none of Woo Joo's family--or her best friend Jun!--made much acknowledgement of the sacrifices Woo Joo has made or gave even the slightest hint that they felt any sympathy for the pain she was clearly experiencing. &gt;! (After the slap from HS, I thought *Jun* would at least have comforted WJ as her friend,  evenif he didn't understand her attachment to DJ.) !&lt; I didn't really get the point of the &gt;! break up; !&lt; it felt artificial, especially when the whole family knew what DJ had done to assist them in &gt;! getting the house back. If Hee Ja is the issue, well we never see how/where she ends up in the end anyway, so what's the difference and why tf does it take HS a full year to tell WJ \"oh hey mom's ok with you two so I am too\" is it because Jun has proposed to her, hmm I wonder! !&lt;\n\nAll that aside, I  loved seeing both leads happy even on their own (especially DJ camping in the rain). I loved Ji Gu (good bro!) being the catalyst to bring them back together, and &gt;! the final scenes of WJ and DJ together, just the two of them with the whole busking audience disappeared, exactly as WJ said she wished in her confession to DJ! \u2764 !&lt;",

Such a beautiful story - I was low-key mad at the older sister and the others in the family for being so anti SWJ x HDJ I was really going girl get him who cares but I loved how everything was intentional + realistic in some aspects. I want more of the leads \ud83e\udd7a",

Especially in the first 8 episodes when Dongjin doesn't speak as much and hus eyes portray all the required emotion. I thought it was mind blowing.\n\nBinged this and lost sleep the whole night. But it is a very human and melancholic depicting so great acting and I love the use of natural sounds in the series. The period of blank silences was profound.\n\nLoved it. Want to watch it slowly another time!",

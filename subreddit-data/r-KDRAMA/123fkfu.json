Spewing statistics without situating the statistics in relevant contextual analysis is also unhelpful. All of which is to say, be careful when commenting on complex subjects, especially if those subjects are out of your area of expertise. \n\nFinally, a reminder that this is Reddit, an anonymous platform. **Sometimes there is no need nor meaning to fight with a comment made by an anonymous internet stranger.**",

That drugs are related to murder rates and crimes overall? \n\nI presume that drug use in SK is low, though, and therefore not a significant factor for their high suicide rate (despite drugs being a factor in most countries), but I would welcome corrections. \n\nAnyway, like I said, I am sorry for the actor, I hope he gets help, but I am perfectly fine with him being blacklisted as someone that works in a field that influences people.",

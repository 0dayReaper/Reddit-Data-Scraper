It looks great!\n\nIf you are looking for a new scene to paint, perhaps something from Mr. Queen when the queen confronts the King after she jumped into the muddy lakebed. It's not traditional in that she's covered in dirt and not acting proper. \n\nhttps://d2anahhhmp1ffz.cloudfront.net/3911607727/db8fc804e90c65a9a769d323f4a11cc09033fdfa",

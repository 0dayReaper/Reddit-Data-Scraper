I don't remember the name(s) off the top of my head--but it's similar to how you can find Marvel and Nat Geo hubs on the US version of Disney+. Now in the US, I imagine Disney feels most kdramas don't fit the US Disney brand and that's why they're experimenting with releasing on Hulu, which they also own and is more of an all ages TV platform.\n\nPersonally I wish we would stop labeling dramas as \"Disney+\" dramas and instead call them Disney produced for [content hub], or otherwise indicate that it's only released in a limited region, because practically every region has Disney+ but they all have different content because of IP laws.",

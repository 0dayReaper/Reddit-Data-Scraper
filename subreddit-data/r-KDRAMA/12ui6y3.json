            "comment": "\"Navillera\" - Last year I had added this drama to my list but kept putting it off and thought that a non-romance show about ballet, a sport I have hardly any knowledge of, wasn't going to be for me so I removed it from my list. But I decided i'd give the show another chance this week and i'm so happy I did. I think by episode 2 I was hooked to the point where I even teared up around episode 9(which isn't hard tbf). There were several actors that were new to me which is a plus! If you guys had reservations on this drama like me I think you should give it a chance, i'm happy that I did.\n\n\nNon-K Drama related but I've been absolutely hooked on older FL younger ML Chinese dramas, they are very addicting haha. I've seen:\n\n\"The Rational Life\" - workplace romance and the chemistry between the leads is incredible. This is the show that sparked my binge of these types of dramas.\n\n\"My Fated Boy\" - childhood trope romance, a worthy watch.\n\n\"She and Her Perfect Husband\" - Marriage contract trope, great chemistry with the leads and the overall story was pretty good.\n\n\"Why Women Love\" - workplace romance, honestly the ML's outfits were really distracting and ugly in my opinion, but Gina Jin or Jin Chen(the FL) is worth the watch alone.\n\n\"Falling Into You\" - Coach/athlete romance with Jin Chen.\n\nCurrently watching \"Find Yourself\" If you guys got anymore recommendations on older FL younger ML dramas let me know!",

I teared up a bunch and like you, felt completely attached to the characters and their stories. Both ML did such a fantastic job and the supporting cast too. \n\nI'm a little sad to see it didn't get much hype or attention because it deserves awards.",

Suffice to say from top to bottom, the cast is amazing and the characters are rich and fascinating. The two MLs, Seo Hwi (Yang Se-jong) and Nam Seon-ho (Woo Do-hwan) have to do the tortuous job of showing their characters' emotional immaturity at the outset, then the middle conflict phase, then the resolution, all while trying to give their idiotic decisions some emotional grounding. They actually carry it off, especially Woo Do-hwan (who already stole my heart in **The King: Eternal Monarch**, which was the first place I saw him).\n\nEveryone's mileage may vary, obviously, but for me, if I imagine the real OTP is Hwi and Seon-ho, with the FL (Seolhyun) and Seon-ho's second-in-command (Kim Dong-won) are their LIs during the middle conflict phase of the plot, I enjoyed it a little more. Yes, I head canon'd a BL sageuk and it worked for me.\n\nHwi *apologizes*, y'all! I'm used to kdrama MLs showing more emotional range than Western stoic MLs, but I was *not* ready for a character to basically admit they were a dipshit when they were a teenager and apologize! MY HEART CRACKED IN HALF.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Lee Hyun-Kyun as Lee Bang-gan. He was just delightful as one of the many Princes, who seems to have no agenda above staying alive and enjoying it, but is also a badass swordsman and quite the wit.\n\nAlso shoutout to Jang Do-ha as Gyeol, the bodyguard of the kisaeng house who has *literally like one spoken line in the entire show* and yet manages to be adorable and stalwart.\n\nIf I keep thinking about it I'll write all day. If period pieces are your jam, this one is worth giving a try. Imo, the plot spent a little too much time in the conflict phase and lost the emotional through-line, but it picked it back up in time to nail the ending.",

It strangely reminded me a little bit of CLOYs epilogue with the whole separation of the main leads thing but they can magically be together occasionally thing, but obviously not quite the same... I feel like I would have enjoyed this more watching it week by week because I would have savored it, but that's my fault for rushing through and binging it, lol. !&lt;",

I\u2019ve never heard this one mentioned before, nor do I have extensive knowledge about the different agencies outside of a few but if this is a fresh one, maybe they have connections to still get him the right roles for him, which would in turn help with their brand face recognition. \n\nThat is a heavyweight actor I don\u2019t think he would sign with an unknown agency that could limit his career.",

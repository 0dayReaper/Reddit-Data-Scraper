They meant to catch Nurse Jungwoo, who was a strong and crazy man and, Youngmin thought he could catch Jungwoo alone without backup?\n\nThe officer must at least be able to detain Dr. Do for 48 hours without warrant, right? And, why did not they manage to seize his cell phone during that time? Even if he deleted all files, the officer most likely could restore something to use against him.\n\nHomicide aside, Dr. Do was caught red-handed for arson. Why did not they charge him on this one? This is already felony and could let the police officer detained him for weeks.\n\nCell phone is like mini PC, right? So, a technician could make a copy of every things in the hard drive without unlocking it, right? Jihyun was a detective, how did not she know this?\n\nThey tracked Dr. Do's whereabout by directly driving a taxi after Nurse Kim? Why did not they place electronic tracker on her car so, they could leave some distance and the nurse would not notice?\n\n If Youngmin wanted to stall Dr. Do, why did not he just poke the tyre or empty the fuel tank of his vehicle? Don't tell me Dr. Do was fleeing on feet.\n\nThere was obvious production error with ghosts having breath fumes. Could eating some ice help?\n\nUpto EP10, I gave this drama 6.5 to 7 out of 10. It was not that good yet I enjoyed watching it and anticipated the next episode. This episode (11) alone worth minus 2.",

When she inevitably wakes up, will she remember Youngmin?\n\nEp. 11: &gt;!oh god don't tell me they're doing the thing where all the ppl they helped over the drama died bc of the same guy. Justice for the orphan guy who was about to be a dad T-T and have a happy ending with his wife !&lt;\n\nwere no autopsies ever conducted at this hospital? or are they not part of medical procedure? altho tbf as a doctor, I'm sure he was able to manipulate the reports, otherwise how was no-one alerted that otherwise healthy ppl just kept dying\n\nsis really manifested a &gt;!force field out of nowhere !&lt;\n\nok ik it's because of space reasons,&gt;! but he really made his gf sleep in his dead mom's room... \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 anyways the way he comforted her and assured she's not the cause of his mom's death was rlly sweet !&lt;\n\nthis boy is so cute but so clingy, bro really said its ok if ppl die as long as i can keep dating my pretty ghost gf.\n\nI've been home from work for the past 3 hours and I've still only progressed 25 mins into the episode aaaaaah when will my suffering end\n\nshe looked really cute [in this scene](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894993187632992357/1093324737985380352/Screenshot_2023-04-05_at_8.00.47_PM.png?width=2160&amp;height=1064), almost makes this episode worth it\n\nain't no way &gt;! this doc became a hackermans to unlock his taxi !&lt; also if the psycho killer audibly gasps and asks if *you* are the crazy one, you gotta start questioning your life choices\n\nwhy do stabby nurse and his addict gf have more tragic couple chemistry than our actual protagonists \ud83d\udc80 \ud83d\udc80 &gt;!and not Jihyun looking at them go to the afterlife like... god i wish that were me... take me with you !&lt;\n\nbruh this boy's habit of talking to his ghost gf in the middle of crowded hallways came back to haunt him\n\nhaha haunt him\n\nget it cause ghost\n\npls tell me &gt;!they already sent the voice recordings to the cops before the inevitable showdown with the villains... atleast some neurons started firing and  they realized they were being surveilled !&lt;\n\nNOOOOOOOOO.... &gt;! DON'T REVEAL THE KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO THE ACCOMPLICE AND THEN GO ALL ALONE TO CONFRONT HIM !&lt;\n\nGOD HAVE MERCY THEY'RE DRAGGING INTO THE FINALE PLS JUST MAKE IT STOP\n\nEp. 12: yeah, this drama turned into Fast and Furious for a bit but still better than expected. At least some neurons started firing and the characters began to use their brain cells\u2026 \n\nAlso they\u2019re back at it with their romance but they have the chemistry of a couple of polite coworkers who say good morning and good afternoons and go their own way at the end of the workday. No way this girl just told her dead MiL &gt;! Don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re dead, I\u2019ll take care of him in your place !&lt; \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80",

The side characters were criminally underused, and the doctor became cartoonish. A lot of wasted potential, same because I think the actors were doing the best with what they had.",

I want my hours back!\n\nLast ep, I actually was hoping the doctor to just kill the stupid ML so he and the GF can move on happily ever after to the next world together. That is how much I have come to hate him and his same face expression.\n\nHow did the doctor can suddenly see all the ghosts?\n\nWhy the ML's mom don't just go home to see his son and her own mom? Is her own mom not important enough to say goodbye to?\n\nWho is the last lady ghost? Did she appeared on the earlier episode when ML asked \"you looked familiar and have we met before??\"",

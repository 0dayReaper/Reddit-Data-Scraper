In this case, the victim is very much legitimate. \n\nWith that said, HaJun was doomed from childhood. As in, in that environment there was no chance for him to grow relatively normal. I still would have preferred if he switched sides and remained in the Rainbow Taxi after finding out that those people are the best ones he has met in life. Still, it is understandable that a fully formed 28-30 y/o wouldn't suddenly change. \n\nGenerally speaking, my favourite part of the show is how it is absolutely ridiculous but much care is put in parts that matter. Kim Do Ki easily getting in prison and beating up dozens of guys? Unrealistic but fun to watch. The Burning Sun episode including the drug that was used and the perfect addition of the detective who was actually killed for investigating the case? A sensitive portrayal of a real life crime. \n\nAnd lastly, Do Ki's psycho prisoner personality really was terrifying. If I met a guy like that I too would be avoiding him like a plague.\n\nEdit: the epilogue was the peak of adorableness. Also, the promo for the next episode! So excited!",

I do believe this might be the end. \nBut we have all the episodes with us, so we can revisit them and adore them all. \nThat being said, it was such a fun ride. I will miss having something awesome for Friday and Saturday nights to watch. \nIt was a great time with you all people as well, discussing and formulating theories for the series. I will miss this. \n\nThank You to Team Model Taxi/Taxi Driver/ Deluxe Taxi. Till we meet again. \nLet's enjoy the finale with happy faces. And keep great memories for us.  Fighting!",

One thing I noticed from comments and reviews from MDL:  kdrama fans are either a fan of thriller or romantic dramas or both. Maybe, u prefer romantic genre that it's why for u it's too dark.\n\nFor me, the sequel IS NOT lackluster---it just have different touch to it. The 1st season has more angst, more serious, more actions while Season 2 have more comedic scenes and less action scenes than Season 1. But both of them are well-written, tackled great cases and scene are executed well. I love both seasons, for me they are equally great.\n\nPeople disappointed in Season 2 are only disappointed because they were expecting more action scenes instead of the story as a whole.",

Also, Kim So Yeon was barely for 5 mins, BUT MY GAWD, is that woman, just gorgeous. I really hope if there is Season 3, they bring her back. Hopefully, they pick up with MCW's cameo, because CLEARLY, there's back story between Do Gi and her character. And I mean, Romantic Backstory. So yea, maybe all this while he didn't affirm Go Eun's feelings because of her ? Who knows. Also, Esom, I wouldn't mind. The cast could very easily use some more members, even if they have shorter time span than the main 5.\n\nEDIT: The Bishop was really an asshole, the way he instigated Do gi and then used a whistle. I was like Wooow !!!, Really low. \n\nAlso, with the ratings that this Season touched, the network and producers would be kinda dumb not to bring it back. But, obviously at the condition that the original writer, who wrote this season stays. That person really can write a wholesome show.Till then, FIGHTING!!!",

LJH was already open to the possibility of ss3 so I hope the rest of the rainbow team can work around their schedules and appear in the new ss together.\n\nNow onto the finale. I feel Taxi driver did a better job of maintaining its steam towards the end than most of the mini series. Many conplained that ss2 toned down on the action, but we got the best fight scene in the second to last episode lol. And I\u2019m still petty that LJH didn\u2019t get nominated for Baeksang. An action-packed role like his usually doesn\u2019t get enough credit for how much hard work it takes. Like the scene he got jumped by all the prisoners. It\u2019s hard to film scenes like that becase the actors have limited space to work with. They basically have to keep throwing punches with no idle time to breathe, to make the fight eyecatching and believable. Btw, kudos to whoever decided to make LJH\u2019s abs visible in that scene coughs coughs\n\nThe scene on the rooftop was so in line with Goeun\u2019s personality. It made my heart flutter more than a downright \u201cI like you\u201d sort of confession. Now that she took a five cm step closer to Doki, here\u2019s to hoping that he would do the same in ss3. See you all when 5283 is in service again.",

I felt some chemistry in  S1, but when they pretended to be a married couple in that case, it felt like they didn't have much compatibility. I'm sure it's meant as a humorous point, but they way they cheerfully 'broke up'/'divorced' when the case was settled made me feel like they were never really that into the idea of a relationship. Plus, since they were teammates together for so long, it feels like there was never any motivation or impetus for change, or for someone to step out and advance the relationship (until Go Eun's words at the end) that this current setup feels like the status quo.",

Because I watched the two seasons back-to-back, I felt like I could completely immerse myself into the drama. Anyway, spoilers ahead!\r  \n\r  \n\rLee Je-hoon has gained a new fan, and I'd like to apologise for missing you all these years of watching K-dramas. Where have I been? I've been missing out on such talent all this while. Lee Je-hoon has stolen my heart, and I have to admit that his performance in Taxi Driver has proven his versatility as an actor. Moving forward, I wish him the best in his future roles and cannot wait to see what else he has to offer. Also, please, I've never swooned for so many characters in one drama before. Seeing Lee Je-hoon play all the iconic characters was incredibly fun and entertaining, and in my opinion, this drama gave him a good platform to showcase his acting range. I would just randomly find myself in awe watching him act out his alter egos. I will miss you, &gt;!Wang Taozi, Shaman Do-gi, Teacher Do-gi,!&lt; just all of them, basically! The number of times I fangirled was ridiculous HAHA \\^\\^\r  \n\r  \nEpisode 16 broke me. &gt;!Especially when On Ha-joon became the last client and got revenge against the Bishop. That whole conversation between On Ha-joon and Kim Do-gi... My gosh, and that flashback scene-!&lt; Why Taxi Driver? My heart hurts for him. &gt;!He might have done so many wrong things, but, if only someone had protected and guided him when he was a kid, taught him what it meant to be a good person... Just like he said, if he had met the Rainbow Taxi team sooner, would his life have been any different? Of course, it would. You would be another member of the Rainbow Taxi family. You would have been able to live a life full of happiness and love. I miss your innocent smile and laughter already. And that tear when he died- How am I supposed to say goodbye to his character?!&lt;\r  \n\r  \n\rI still have a lot to say, but I'll have to end it here. Wrapping it all up, I hope we get a Season 3 soon 'cause it has barely been hours since I last watched the final episode, and I'm missing the Rainbow Taxi team already. &gt;!It did end with an open ending, and while I'm not entirely sure if the final message implied a possible sequel!&lt;, all in all, I hope we get to see them again. This is officially one of the best K-dramas I've seen so far. A perfect mix of humour, romance, drama, mystery, and thriller. I loved it so much and will remember the fun ride I had with the Rainbow Taxi team. The rollercoaster of emotions and the lessons I learnt... It was a blast. Thank you. :)\r  \n\r  \n&gt;!\"You're not there alone, are you? Do not be alone, not when you're hurting.\"!&lt; This message hit me hard, and so I'd like to conclude by adding on to this. Whoever is reading this, I wish you all the best in life, and may you be blessed with happiness always. Don't ever be afraid or even hesitate to reach out when you need help, and don't ever suffer alone. Whatever struggles you go through, I'm sure you'll be able to overcome them. You can do it! Love ya, and stay strong, okay? Fighting! :) \r  \n\r  \n*virtual hugs*\r  \n\r  \nWith that, \uc544\ub155, \ubaa8\ubc94\ud0dd\uc2dc\\~ \u2665",

                    "comment": "On the topic of Lee Je-hoon's versatility, I recommend Move to Heaven on Netflix (one of the best Kdramas out there imo). He plays a completely different character and is almost unrecognizable. I got so amazed by his acting range and depth, because I was watching it alongside Taxi Driver S1 back in 2021. This man is truly an acting chameleon.\n\nGlad to hear he's gained another fan! While LJH is an A-list and critically acclaimed actor in South Korea, I believe he's yet to gain major international recognition which he so deserves given his enormous talent. Please check out LJH's other works!! He has a knack for choosing unique projects. Some of my favorites are Tomorrow With You (a romcom with Shin Min-ah), Bleak Night, I Can Speak, Signal, and Move to Heaven.",

It was phenomenal. A masterpiece. And I couldn't agree with you more regarding his acting. I was really blown away by his performance as Cho Sang-gu, and I'm forever holding on to the hope there will be a sequel. I also very much believe that Move to Heaven is one of the best dramas out there. I can't put into words what I felt watching the drama. I was pretty much an emotional mess. Goodness, I am already starting to miss the show! :\"\n\nHe honestly deserves all the recognition and praise, 'cause he's killing it out there. All of his roles that I've seen so far have been superbly portrayed, and I can see his talent and skill as an actor shining through. I actually just finished Signal yesterday, and I did watch I Can Speak back then too! I intend on watching Tomorrow With You or Bleak Night next! Hands down, one of the best actors I've seen. :)\n\nI became a huge fan of him after watching him in Taxi Driver, but watching his other works just solidified my love for him. Now that I'm in my craze, it bums me out that I missed him when he was getting recognised for his earlier works like Bleak Night, Signal, and so much more. But I suppose being late is better than never.\n\nAnyway, a little late, but let's celebrate Season 3 being confirmed! \\^\\^",

I dunno but let\u2019s hope for Season 3 we need answer to this like SBS don\u2019t just end and leave us clueless like thissss. \n\nAnw Lee Je Hoon and ALL of the casts never disappoint! I will wait patiently for their future projects soon! \u2661\n\n\nEDIT: THEY CONFIRMED SEASON 3 FOR TAXI DRIVER!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\n\nhttps://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/382/0001045503?lfrom=twitter",

I think there are a lot of crime stories (quite sad on this fact...) out there that they can extend to another season but I wonder if it is stretching it a bit too far, maybe not used of K-drama doing multiple seasons. That said, I did enjoy S2, love team Rainbow &lt;3. This drama bring awareness to the horrible crimes that many might not know. \n\nProbably the only salty point I have is I was kinda hope Shin Jae Ha would be their new team member instead of being the villain.",

Surely she can spend one day to film that scene? Anyway, I enjoy this season, I thought Oh Hajun had a satisfying ending despite the slow burn. I think they relied too heavily on flashbacks for every cases (like having Kim Dogi in a situation where he seemingly can\u2019t escape, only to show the flashback where the team prepared for that particular situation).

I had this tiny hope that he would work in Rainbow Taxi for ages to come to pay for his crimes, that would have been an interesting angle for the following seasons. Still, the ending made sense. Not sure why Do Ki's presence was needed on that rooftop but okay.\n\n- Go Eun basically confessed. I might be in minority here, but I really don't want a new loveline for Do Ki. If the writers are deadset on him and Go Eun not ending up together, at least they should do it by giving a love interest to Go Eun instead. Poor girl has been jealous more than once and with how obvious she is in her feelings, it is hurting, watching Do Ki give little to no indications in turn. \n\n- The last episode, like the whole show, was a mess, but somehow it was fun throughout. Can't wait for the third season.\n\n- the popular opinion: The Rainbow Taxi team is the OTP of the show.",

I can't get Cheon So-jin out of my head whenever I see her. &gt;!  Seeing her barge in and save them was amazing though. I knew Mr. Jang had a plan when he pulled out the phone but this was not the plan I was expecting at all.  !&lt; I think they did a good job or wrapping up the main villain this season. And man seeing the flashbacks of &gt;! Ha On at the Taxi Company really hit me in the feels. His character was way beyond the point of redemption but seeing those flashbacks gives you a sense of \"what-if\" !&lt;\n\nOverall I enjoyed this season. Personally I wished they mixed in more grittiness from season 1 into this season but it was still an enjoyable season. The added humor was fun, I think it just needed some balance at times. Also loved Mr. Jang's escape from the mansion, one my favorite scenes by far.\n\nI'm so glad season 3 has been confirmed. The way this show has been set up, multiple seasons work great and I look forward to the cases we will see in S3. I wouldn't mind a full One Dollar Lawyer collab or Esom's return. I know many people didn't like her character in S1 but I was really looking forward to how her character would work with the Rainbow taxi team after the set up they had at the end of S1.",

It was really satisfying how &gt;!OHJ pushed the Bishop down just like how he was tricked to push his father down to death without him knowing that it was his dad.

Sadly, it seems that Doki just rejected Goeun again.!&lt;\n\n(https://imgur.com/6SUnBm1)\n\nAnd also the spectacle camera is back in action haha!\n\n(https://imgur.com/eUkJXNy) \n\nAlso the last part where they literally didn't shy away from revealing their organisation name on the van! This is a first. Because they always disguise their van into something else. It's really sooooo coooolllll!!!!\n\n(https://imgur.com/JmDEFTA)\n\nOverall the last few eps is really interesting. Really enjoyed the last few eps. \n\nSeems like there will be &gt;!S3 since they showed the deluxe taxi going back on service and seems like the next case would require Doki to be back to the place that brings him bad memories. I'm hoping he would be able to overcome his trauma of the blowing of whistle!&lt;\n\nFurthermore, they did such a great job in the ending credit video I'm loving it soooo much!\n\nP1: https://imgur.com/k0XYFco\nP2: https://imgur.com/l0tpOk2\n\nAll in all, this is a good drama (though with plot holes here and there) and had me seating on my edge always praying for the team's safety while trying to help their clients. It's really an action drama + revenge drama + comedy drama.\n\nTo be honest, it had been an amazing journey catching this drama every week since the drama premiered. I'm praying for a S3 really. I need it so badly. So thankful that SBS decided to make a S2. Thank you to all the cast members who did such a great job in the drama. Now I'm wondering what drama I should watch next haha. Till then see yall :)\n\n(Also if anyone are interested in the BGM they used, SBS had released the Taxi Driver 2 album which contains all the OST and BGM used in this season: https://open.spotify.com/album/63OIbwbhlenUoQdzeRke68?si=MF1WKmdvQ6yAmPEwouqNFg)",

            "comment": "Ep 16 - the series ended well despite having issues in the middle. I honestly don't want a S3, I think this is already be a good wrap up of Taxi Driver. The scene with Moon chae-won is a cliffhanger, but I imagine it as the next case that the Team would tackle and MCW is just their next client, which is why KDK ignored her so as not to look suspicious as others have pointed out. It's already established in the finale that the Team would continue their journey of bringing justice to those in need. That's a perfect ending. \n\nIf SBS is really bent on producing a S3 though, I'd love to see a spin-off of the first Taxi Driver starring Kim So-yeon instead. That would be so effing cool and I'm already excited by the thought of it. \n\nAs a fan of actor LJH, I do want to see him exploring other genres and working with different directors and writers (critically acclaimed filmmakers who could finally land him a Baeksang nod lol). Or perhaps, focusing on his film career since he is more of a film actor after all. He might also start getting typcast in the action/crime genre if he decides to do a S3, since his next projects lined up are also of similar nature.",

            "comment": "I'm not a fan of this season. I know most people disliked the second half of the last season and the prosecutor, but at least there was some substance. Here, most things fell flat. The previous season worked so well because it had a morally gray tone, a distinct theme, and struck the right balance between seriousness and comedy. In this season, they took the comedy too far, which didn't fit well with the heavy subjects they tackled. Additionally, the fight scenes were quite mediocre.\n\nThe Vietnam case started off good but became silly goofy. It was strange to have the most unserious recurring character appear in such a dark case, and it threw off the entire vibe. The cases involving the elderly were good, but they dragged on for too long. As for the apartment case.... this was the most frustrating. It was overly complicated and fizzled out any chemistry between the leads from the first season. The characters were completely dumbed down for the sake of \"romantic\" comedy and for OP Doki.\n\nThe Sunbaek cult had a lot of potential, but it was used as a comedic filler episode. In the end, what convinced the cult members to leave was just a few recorded clips of their leader admitting to being a con man, which makes the team's efforts redundant and doesn't logically make any sense either. There was a moment where they played a trick on him in his chapel, which would have been a more interesting and believable way for the members to snap out of their trance.\n\nThe surgery malpractice case had Doki switching characters excessively, and it's hard to believe that no one noticed. It became even sillier in the Burning Sun arc, where I couldn't take it seriously anymore. He's supposed to be dead, for god's' sake. \n\nThe finale was alright, but they could have done more with Ha Joon. I think Ha Joon calling for revenge should have happened at the end of Episode 13. This would have given viewers a chance to see the inner workings of the organization and gain more insight into Ha Joon's character. It would have made more sense for Ha Joon to have an internal struggle over seeking revenge on the Bishop rather than an immediate switch. After all, he was brainwashed from a young age into the cult, and the Bishop is his father figure. Nevertheless, I'm not upset about how it ended.\n\nIn the next season, I hope to see more development for the side characters, especially the chairman. I really enjoyed his character in the first season, but they didn't utilize him well here. Also, I would prefer if they didn't introduce 50 characters in one case for Doki. It's becoming repetitive, and I didn't particularly enjoy how he portrayed them. It feels like different versions of the same act. When I saw him playing the security guard with tattoos, I was excited because I thought we would see something different, but unfortunately, it was the same dumb and cheeky guy. The prison character didn't come across as psycho either. I don't know, I'm just so disappointed in this season.",

So many levels of fked up how the Bishop \u201chazed\u201d him basically. I kind of wish there was a harsher punishment for him, he got off too easy for something so diabolical. Though I understand the poetic justice of it all. As tragic as it was, I thought they wrapped it up well. The montage at the end also made me realise that maybe the reason why OHJ (or rightfully, Kim Dan Woo) kept prolonging the taxi driver act was maybe because of the team and how it made him feel. For once, he got to be treated well without conditions. He was part of this family and not some criminal organization. People cared for him just because. He got to act like this innocent youngster who never killed anyone. He got to have a hyung. Ah so heartbreaking to think about. For a moment, I thought it would\u2019ve been nice if he became a new recruit but I knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen because of all his actions this season. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the series though at times I compared it to s1 and there was something a bit more punchy about that. Honestly it was probably the fact that a lot of the cases were portrayed in a very dark and depressing manner but that was also sometimes criticised as trauma p*rn which I also understand. At times, I appreciated the lighter approach we had this season, because it meant I didn\u2019t have to feel as much second hand pain. That\u2019s not to say the cases this season weren\u2019t infuriating or unjust, they were but I guess we know have that belief that the team will pull through and punish the bad guys.\n\nI felt like for me, I just enjoyed the instant gratification of them pulling off their ruses and bad guys being taken down that I was able to ignore most of the plot holes and some of the farfetched writing in the name of entertainment. Oh also I personally preferred not having Kang Hana this season, though I adore Esom. Her character was pretty poorly written and detracted a lot from s1 for me.\n\nI also didn\u2019t care much for KSY cameo though she was badass af. It seemed a bit convenient but meh as long as the crew are safe and together, I\u2019m glad. I thought it was clever though to establish that there could be other drivers out there. Opens up the possibility of a prequel or a spin-off for s3 if they somehow can\u2019t land the same cast etc. though I would be greatly disappointed if any of the team left.

I like the fact that their original characters are grey, that we\u2019re shown that while it\u2019s romantic to know of a love story where the two partners have such strong emotions for each other they made decisions despite knowing what the repercussions of their actions might be and that the present day versions are conflicted / at odds with their past selves. \n\nI also really love the brother. Actually the pair of them as siblings are basically adorkable. I also love that he\u2019s warmed up to Kokdu. &gt;!I don\u2019t know what law to apply to you because I only know South Korean law!&lt;. HAHAHA. Gold. \n\nLooking forward to the final 3 episodes and how it all unfolds. Not a fan of the preview and the inevitable Ep 14 &gt;!let\u2019s break up!&lt; but in their case may be somewhat justified since they\u2019ve essentially been ill fated for each other it sounds like.",

But it never reaches the heights or depths that Goblin does. \n\nThe characters aren't as enjoyable, the plot isn't as fleshed out, and the production value isn't even close. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.\n\nIf you've never seen Goblin before...just watch that instead. It's better in every way. If you've already seen that and feel like watching something similar...then dive in! Just temper your expectations.\n\nIf you didn't like Goblin (first, who hurt you?) then there is almost zero chance you will enjoy this show.",

Also the use of the line about the 'pretty noona that feeds him'.\n\nAlso the 'Nam Se Ri' is a great reference, I'm bummed that I didn't realize it until Ok Shin highlighted it! \n\nHan Chul's reaction to Kokdu being a god was fantastic! I really loved his speech about him being a cop for &gt;!human beings and only knowing the laws for people, therefore he has no 'authority' to go after Kokdu as a god!&lt;. It creates a nice parallel to Kokdu's punishment of coming to the world of the living to execute 'divine' justice against human criminals.\n\nHan Gye Jeol's reaction was also on point, especially when she talked about how she only saw what she wanted to see. I think this is one of those cases where the audience being extra aware of the difference between what drama characters *know* versus what the audience has seen is extremely important. As the audience we have an omniscient view of the story and that affects how we judge the words and actions of the character as we have access to more information in comparison. It's a good exercise in considering the perspective of others.\n\nI really love that my love for this drama has grown episode by episode. The dialogue in this drama is full of callbacks, wordplay, and references, making it so much more lovely and meaningful. I'll definitely need a rewatch in the future to really enjoy the dialogue to the fullest.",

It's more of a straightforward romance story with a revenge side plot that incorporates a bit of fantasy, mostly to make the ML (who is an angel with a mission) have a higher stake in the (romance) story than a regular human ML would.\n\nThe fantasy world-building in the drama is minimal and pretty basic. That side, great acting, especially the FL, and fantastic music/visuals made a solid story a very emotional watch. I'd recommend it!",

I found the title corny, but because it was such a massive hit with the Korean audience and with international viewers, I decided to watch it to find out what the buzz was all about. I\u2019m glad that I started watching it, because a month after CLOY ended, the COVID-19 lockdowns started in various countries. A lot of us probably were able to endure the lockdowns because of K-dramas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I love Seol In-ah, and I just found out that she\u2019ll be appearing in a drama titled \u201cSparkling Watermelon\u201d and which will be aired later this year.** This drama is described in Soompi as a \"fantasy coming-of-age drama in which a CODA (child of deaf adult) student born with a gift for music crash lands at an unfamiliar place after time traveling through a suspicious music shop.\" **I\u2019m looking forward to \u201cSparkling Watermelon\u201d for several reasons:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1)** I\u2019ve watched \u201cCoda,\u201d the 2022 Oscar winner for Best Picture starring Emilia Jones and Marlee Matlin, among others. I\u2019ve always been interested in sign language; during my college days, I bought a book on American sign language and tried to learn how to sign. In \u201cCoda,\u201d there's a scene where the deaf-mute father meets his daughter\u2019s boyfriend for the first time; in a hilarious and at the same time cringe worthy manner, he signs to his totally flustered daughter (played by Emilia Jones) and her boyfriend how to have safe sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2)** The writer of \u201cSparkling Watermelon\u201d Jin Soo Wan also wrote \u201cKill Me Heal Me,\u201d \u201cThe Moon That Embraces The Sun,\u201d and \u201cChicago Typewriter.\u201d I haven\u2019t seen \u201cKill Me Heal Me,\u201d but TMTETS and \u201cChicago Typewriter\u201d are two of my favorite dramas; I expect that \u201cSparkling Watermelon\u201d will also be an intelligent drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cCrash Landing on You\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kdo8rhjlq9sa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=488a35da3b42a96f1c6bfbcd770875304ee6406f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. Ep. 1:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-1.** This drama was possibly inspired by the real-life, 2008 incident involving a South Korean actress and her companions whose boat drifted into North Korean waters. Please read \u201cBoat Carrying Actress Rescued Near Border\u201d (Korea Times) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-2.** The paragliding incident that brought Se-ri to North Korea was based on a 2007 incident in New South Wales, Australia involving a German paraglider named Ewa Wi\u015bnierska (a member of the German national paragliding team). She survived extreme cold, lightning, and lack of oxygen during an ascent to almost 33,000 feet (higher than Mount Everest) inside a cumulonimbus cloud. She landed 3.5 hours later about 37 miles north of her starting position. ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewa_Wi%C5%9Bnierska); see also the [YT video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TEpKNla63Kw)) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tmrr2yauq9sa1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Ep. 3, &gt;!the insurance agent!&lt; mentions Ewa Wi\u015bnierska\u2019s incident as proof that Se-ri could have survived her paragliding accident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-3.** During the welcome dinner, Se-ri\u2019s sister-in-law offers a tofu cake to Se-ri\u2019s father. Since the days of the Joseon Dynasty, tofu has been given to newly-released prisoners; it\u2019s the symbol of a new life or beginning. For more information, please read \u201cWhy do people eat tofu after prison in Korea?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-4.** As she confronts Ri Jeong-hyeok after landing on the North Korean side of the DMZ, Se-ri mentions the movie \u201cJoint Security Area\u201d aka \u201cJSA.\u201d This is a 2000 hit movie starring Lee Young-ae (star of the classic drama \u201cA Jewel in the Palace\u201d), Lee Byung-hun (Eugene Choi in \u201cMr. Sunshine\u201d), and Song Kang-ho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cJoint Security Area\u201d won Best Film at the 2000 Blue Dragon Film Awards and the 2001 Grand Bell Awards; it was also highly praised by Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7b7xs80r9sa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddb4923fc780a3b6bf0a4e32ce7bb90ca1a720a3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-5.** Se-ri becomes terrified of being charged as a spy and then being sent to the Aoji Coal Mine. Located in Kyonghung County, Undok, North Korea, this mine is a notorious place where South Korean POWs were imprisoned and tortured. (Aoji means \u201ca place of burning stones.\u201d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. Ep. 2:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSe-ri tries to convince Ri Jyeong Hyeok to help her by citing [\u201cHeungbu and Nolbu,\u201d a popular, 200-year old, Korean bedtime story for children](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l-Zqd--LZxs). The story tells of a greedy, older brother (Nolbu) and a kind, younger brother (Heungbu). Nolbu cheated Heungbu of the inheritance from their father, but Heungbu later became rich after he rescued a swallow that was about to be eaten by a snake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, Se-ri wants Ri Jeong-hyeok (Heungbu) to help her (the swallow), and someday, the swallow will reward him greatly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn &gt;!Ep. 11, Se-ri buys several expensive suits and shirts for Ri Jeong-hyeok. When Ri Jeong-hyeok sees that the total price for the purchases is 25 million won (20 thousand US dollars), he takes Se-ri aside and asks her what she\u2019s doing. But Se-ri reassures him that she\u2019s the grateful swallow (around the 42:18 mark) who is rewarding the farmer who saved her.!&lt; Although the subtitles use the word \u201cfarmer,\u201d if you listen closely to Se-ri\u2019s dialogue, you will hear her say \u201cHeungbu.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSe-ri and Ri Jeong-hyeok\u2019s men cook their food as they sit on a low table, the kind which you\u2019ll often see in K-dramas. This table is called \u201cpyeong-sang\u201d or literally, flat table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9ammg35r9sa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=02aaddf18f177793bc010e2087989a9db3ccc45c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C. Ep. 5: Romeo and Juliet, Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe North Korean village women try &gt;!to comfort Se-ri for having been dumped by Ri Jeong-hyeok in favor of Seo-dan. Se-ri tells them that her love story with Ri Jeong-hyeok is!&lt; like that of Romeo and Juliet. When the women say that they don\u2019t know who Romeo and Juliet are, she then tells them that they\u2019re like Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story of Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo is part of Korean mythology relating to the \u201cChilseok\u201d festival. They\u2019re lovers who are permitted to meet only once a year, and their tears during their separation signal the start of the monsoon season. For more information, please read \u201cChilseok: The Traditional Korean Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d (Asia Society) or view this [YT video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=usZM0P5wg3M).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D. Ep. 6: \u201csoseol\u201d or first snow (its various meanings)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile at the coffee shop, Se-ri sees the first snow falling; she explains to Ri Jeong-hyeok that lovers in South Korea always look forward to being together when the first snow starts falling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Korea.net: \u201cFor Koreans, the first snowfall is a joyous moment. In traditional society, \u2018soseol\u2019 was not a seasonal holiday and was perceived simply as a day that signals the beginning of winter preparations. These preparations included stocking up on kimchi and preparing fields for the upcoming frosts.\u201d According to popular belief, if you confess your love for someone during the first snow, you will always be with that person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \u201cFirst Snow in Korean culture\u201d: \u201cCrash Landing on You \u201d was written by Park Ji-eun who also wrote the 2014 blockbuster hit \u201cMy Love from the Star.\u201d In that drama, she offers another explanation for the significance of the first snow \u2014 it marks the day when people can tell a lie, and the Joseon king will forgive them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE. Ep. &gt;!16!&lt;: The North Korean village women and \u201cSaudade\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Near the end of Ep. 16, the village women receive from Seo-dan\u2019s mother the latest cosmetic products from Se-ri\u2019s company. To their surprise, the boxes for the cosmetics have their names and images printed on them. Seo-dan\u2019s mother tells them that Se-ri\u2019s name for this line of cosmetics is \u201cSaudade.\u201d!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSaudade\u201d is a Portuguese term meaning \u201cdeep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one cares for or loves while simultaneously having positive emotions towards the future. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had again.\u201d ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F. Miscellaneous observations:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F-1.** Ep. 2: Se-ri looks at the books in Ri Jeong-hyeok\u2019s closet; one of the books is titled \u201cMemoirs of a Geezer.\u201d It\u2019s the autobiography of John Wardle, better known as Jah Wobble, the bass player of the UK punk group \u201cPublic Image Limited.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F-2.** In several scenes set in Switzerland, Ri Jeong-hyeok is shown taking pictures of landscapes and of Se-ri; Se-ri also uses that camera to take a picture of **Ri Jeong-hyeok and Seo-dan**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt2xwieir9sa1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8b0706eec255a27d2b6a7981c2c24c4502c3fffa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe camera is the 24 megapixel, Black Paint special edition Leica M-P 240, fitted with a Summicron-M 35mm f/2 ASPH lens. It is the world\u2019s second full-frame mirrorless camera and is compatible with Leica\u2019s legendary M lenses. Total price of the Leica body and the lens is approximately 10,000.

And even if the country as a whole recovers as those cyclical indicators turn positive again, for some people the disaster drags on indefinitely.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis, known invariably in South Korea as the \u2018IMF Crisis,\u2019 was such an event. Over the 20 years since the nominal end of the bad times, the legacy of the crisis is a reorientation of the country\u2019s systems of employment and a growing increase in inequality. It also affected a psychological change: People here no longer make the same assumptions about lifelong stability and employment at family-like companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelated resource: \u201cThe Long Shadow of the Asian Financial Crisis in South Korea\u201d (2021) by Yong Kwon (fellow and director of communications at the Korea Economic Institute of America)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Ep. 1, a conflict arises when Hee-do &gt;!accuses her mother of selling the gold wedding rings; her mother replies that she did it because it\u2019s her duty to the country and because she\u2019s a public figure!&lt;.

At the train station, the Japanese fencer profusely offers her apology to Hee-do; when the fencer senses that Hee-do doesn\u2019t understand her, she switches to French, and Hee-do replies in French (an earlier episode shows Hee-do growing up in Paris, France)!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Ep. 12, Hee-do &gt;!surprises Yi-jin by speaking French with the man who lost his luggage.

Meanings of the term \u201cChicago Typewriter\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-1**. Ep. 1 states that the term refers to the Thompson submachine gun because of the sound it makes when being fired. The gun was invented by John T. Thompson in 1918 during World War I and became infamous during the Prohibition era, being a signature weapon of various organized crime syndicates in the United States. It was a common sight in the media of the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals. ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe book that Se-joo is holding in Ep. 1 shows the 1928 model of the Thompson submachine gun, which was designed for the US Marines, with a lower rate of fire to make the gun more controllable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe [video clip from the 2015 hit movie \u201cAssassination\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLa2fpIraW4) starring Jun Ji-hyun shows how a Thompson submachine gun sounds like a typewriter. Two historical figures depicted in this movie are said to have inspired the 1930 characters of this drama \u2014 independence fighter and leader Kim Won Bong was the inspiration for \u201cHwi-young,\u201d while traitor and head of the secret police Yem Sek Jin was the inspiration for \u201cYoung-min.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-2.** The term also refers to the typewriter that Se-joo found in a caf\u00e9 in Chicago. Instead of the QWERTY keyboard, however, this typewriter had Hangul characters. (The 1st picture below is the typewriter used in this drama; the 2nd picture is the oldest Hangul typewriter, now displayed at the National Hangeul Museum.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiu5qhw4s9sa1.jpg?width=220&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88e18e760b3fd75c155370a0043e999ec1794b9f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe oldest Hangul typewriter was invented by Song Ki Joo in 1926 when he was studying at the University of Chicago. In 1933, he entered an agreement with The Underwood Typewriter Company in New York to manufacture this 4-set typewriter. It is now being displayed at the National Hangeul Museum.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. Ep. 1 reference to Salvador Dali\u2019s painting \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of Ep. 1, we can briefly see a molten clock on a table in the caf\u00e9 in Chicago where Se-joo took a break. That molten clock is based on Salvador Dali\u2019s 1931 painting, which is the most prominent example of Surrealism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9kni3q9s9sa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=369645927908eedd38de1d04b706f958a2707a01\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis drama also uses paintings such as a Renoir painting in Ep. 2 and the 1867 painting by \u00c9douard Manet of a boy blowing bubbles in Ep. 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C. In Ep. 1, a dog (\u201cSapsali\u201d or \u201cSapsaree\u201d)** &gt;!leads Seol into Se-joo\u2019s house!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The \u201cSapsali\u201d is a shaggy South Korean breed of dog. Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Sapsali has been called as a \u201clion dog\u201d for its bulky and strong upper body and its large and imposing paws. Most of the Sapsali is medium-sized and slightly tall. Its adult coat is long and abundant, and comes in various colors, including solid and/or mixed shades of black, golden yellowish-blonde, reddish-orange, browns, and salt-and-pepper greys. Its hair falls over the eyes in the same manner as that of the Old English Sheepdog.

In 1933, he joined Kim Won Bong\u2018s Korean National Revolutionary Party\u2019s military Organizations but left after an ideological dispute. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Episode 9, Se-joo asked Jin-oh &gt;!how Soo-yeon learned how to shoot!&lt;. Jin-oh replied, \u201cThe success of Yun Bong Gil bombing operation in Shanghai last year, has solidified the position of the provisional government. Sadly, the plan to assassinate the Japanese minister has failed.\u201d Yun Bong Gil was the member of Korean Patriotic Corps, a secret organization that aimed to assassinate prominent Japanese figures of the Empire of Japan. Jin-oh was referring to the [Hongkou (Hongkew) Park bombing incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Bong-gil#Hongkew_Park_Bombing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**E.

Some of the lines state: \u201cWhen roses bloom and the heart flutters / give me that smile of yours / If there is a song you must sing / then sing it now / for when your day draws to a close / it is already too late to sing. / Sing your song now.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis poem is based on the writings of famed American preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892). At the bottom portion of the poem, you can see the Hangul characters \ucc30\uc2a4 \uc2a4\ud384\uc804 which stand for \u201cCharles Spurgeon.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpurgeon was Calvinist in theology; one of the tenets of Calvinism is unconditional election or predestination The drama\u2019s writer could have chosen some other \u201ccarpe diem\u201d poem from Korean poets, and so, why did she choose this poem? Could she have intended to say something about fate, reincarnation, and predestination? After all, Tae-min\u2019s novel is titled \u201cFate,\u201d right?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**G.

The person who wrote \u201cChicago Typewriter\u201d also wrote \u201cThe Moon\u201d That Embraces The Sun\u201d where the main character Wol (played by Han Ga-in) was a shaman in Seongsucheong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**G-3.** Ep. 3: \u201cBlue Square Book Park\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the halfway point of this episode, Se-jo and Tae-min film a public service campaign. The scene is set in the \u201cBlue Square Book Park.\u201d Located in the upscale Itaewon district, the Blue Square is the largest performing art hall in Korea.

In the folk tale, cows and magpies formed a bridge across the Milky Way so that Gyeon-woo and Jiknyo could meet. In the same way, the Sapsali dog was the bridge for Seol to meet Se-joo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**G-7.** Ep. 6: At the early part of this episode, Seol marks certain lines in a book and later gives the book to Se-joo to inspire him to keep on writing.

An Associated Press investigation shows that the abuse of these so-called vagrants at Brothers, the largest of dozens of such facilities, was much more vicious and widespread than previously known, based on hundreds of exclusive documents and dozens of interviews with officials and former inmates.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet nobody has been held accountable to date for the rapes and killings at the Brothers compound because of a cover-up orchestrated at the highest levels of government, the AP found. Two early attempts to investigate were suppressed by senior officials who went on to thrive in high-profile jobs; one remains a senior adviser to the current ruling party. Products made using slave labor at Brothers were sent to Europe, Japan and possibly beyond, and the family that owned the institution continued to run welfare facilities and schools until just two years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant article: \u201cReport: South Korea rounded up, abused vagrants before 1988 Games\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l76bhkqet9sa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c5f3064fca29cc7827979a2f8e315459b7c28dcc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAnna\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. \u201cAnna\u201d is based on the 2007-2008 scandal on fake academic credentials** that started with Shin Jeong-ah (an art history professor at Dongguk University, the top Buddhist university in Korea) and soon involved \u201ca movie director, a renowned architect, the head of a performing arts center, a popular comic book writer, a celebrity chef, actors and actresses, and a former TV news anchor.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cRevelations of False Credentials Shake South Korea\u201d (NYT, 2007):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In July, reports emerged that Shin Jeong-ah, an art history professor who had risen quickly in the art world, had faked her credentials.

Status is largely determined by someone\u2019s role in an organisation, which organisation they work for, which university they went to and their marital status.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although gender equality is increasing, men still dominate the Korean workplace. It is expected businesswomen act in a manner that is considered refined and \u2018feminine\u2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The exchange of business cards is an essential part of initial meetings.

While still standing, you should politely hand a business card over with two hands, and receive one in return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. \u201cGuanxi\u201d (Eps. 16-19)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Executive Director orders Sales Team 3 &gt;!to work on several contracts in China that could bring in 500 million US dollars in revenues. But Oh Sang-Sik tells his team about his reservations \u2014 the ethical problems of using connections and reciprocal favors (\u201cguanxi\u201d) to get the deals approved in China and the interlocking deals. He also tells his team that the Executive Director, who\u2019s aiming to be promoted to Vice-president, could use them as a scapegoat if the deals fail!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cUnderstanding the concept of guanxi\u201d:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Guanxi is often translated as \u201cconnections\u201d, \u201crelationships\u201d or \u201cnetworks\u201d. However, none of these terms do justice to the fundamental and complex concept of guanxi and its central role in Chinese culture. Guanxi can also be used to describe a network of contacts, which an individual can call upon when something needs to be done, and through which they can exert influence on behalf of another. These networks can have a direct impact on conducting business in China, including market expansion and sales growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cHow A Better Understanding Of Guanxi Can Improve Your Business In China\u201d (Forbes, 2018): Guanxi loosely translates as personal connections, relationships or social networks. It implies trust and mutual obligations between parties, and it operates on personal, familial, social, business and political levels. Having good, bad or no guanxi impacts one\u2019s influence and ability to get things done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C.

I don\u2019t speak or read Korean, and so I can\u2019t search through Naver. Those of you who read Korean or are more knowledgeable about Korean culture and history should correct whatever errors or omissions there may be in this discussion.\n\n\u200b\n\n**(2)** Some of the linked resources in this discussion are in PDF format. If you are using the latest version of Mozilla Firefox as your browser, it will give you the choice of viewing the PDF online instead of downloading it.\n\n\u200b\n\n**(3)** This discussion is rather long and may be a bit boring for those of you who don\u2019t like history. If you got tired reading this discussion, you can energize yourself by listening to Band-Maid\u2019s performances during their 2022 USA tour. Band-Maid is an all-female Japanese band that mixes genres such as rock (hard, progressive, punk), metal, pop, jazz, and blues.

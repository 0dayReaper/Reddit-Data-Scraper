It's popular because it's a calming antidote that has came out in a time of turbulence.\n\nHere's one example : There was this chairman who was portrayed in a evil way in the first ep. We would think he's the main villain for the whole show. But he turns out to be a lovable old man who's the childhood friend of a main cast's mother.\n\nSome people might dislike it for having no main plot (its slice of life). But the fact that it has no plot makes it easier for the show to explore different relationships without having to tie it to something major. Plus, you don't need to worry abt any characters getting backstabbed or deduce their motives, which is all I need when we are already facing so much stress due to Corona.\n\n\"Boring\" is good when life is already full of drama",

The bonus is watching the mini stories and developments unfold among the huge cast, and like their previous works there are touching moments that make it worth the watch for me (Ik Jun inspired by the father who lost weight to be a donor is one). I do find the writing engaging with the twists and parallels/contrast between different scenarios.\n\nIt is also nice to watch a show cover different topics from other shows. Despite the huge societal pressure to get married at 40 (reminded by the elders) they are in no hurry themselves to seek romance and spend limited free time bonding with friends. Also the lack of work life balance, as seen in Chu Min Ha's long day at work dealing with stressful patients, or the scenes of doctors/nurses getting interrupted before digging into a meal or wolfing down ramen.",

The thing that they are both similar is the fact that both him and Shin PD have an almost perfect track record, with their shows all being light-hearted yet having a meaningful plot at the same time. Both also have a reputation of finding out breakout stars through their shows (eg. Park Bogum vs Chris Pratt)\n\nCredit to Lee Woo Jung too! She and Shin makes a fantastic duo\n\nThe ratings are sourced from Douban, the Chinese ImDB. The reason i source from there is due to the fact that English K-drama rating portals are extremely scaled-up. In comparison, The Heirs has a 91 rating on AsianWiki , while having a 6.9 rating on Douban. (P.S Hospital Playlist only has a 78 rating on AsianWiki for some reason)\n\nThe number below the stars is \"how many people have rated\"",

Some kdramas even end with leads having no chemistry at all, let alone 5 people.\n\nLike all of their stories, there are no dramas with the actors- to a point that they get their own variety shows as a group. You can see in the variety shows that the casts remain as good friends.\n\nAlso similar to Michael Schur, ShinPD can call up any actor from his previous works for a cameo.",

Unlike 1997 and 1994, it starred more than one family (with all them families in the neighborhood), and it included many scenes centering on the parents on top of scenes with the kids (if u know what i mean). 1988 showed the struggles of the parents as they grew much older and put everything into their families. \n\nIt also showed many different types of parents. For example, there was Sunwoo\u2019s mom who wanted to know everything about Sunwoo\u2019s life and be a supporter for him. There was Deoksun\u2019s parents who although struggled with money, raised three children proudly. There was Taek\u2019s dad who raised his son alone. There was Junghwan\u2019s parents who wished for a stronger family bond. And there was Dongryong\u2019s parents who seemed busy and aloof but always had his best thought in mind.\n\nThis drama kind of exposes the hardships some parents have \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d while we arent watching.. Every time the 1988 parents struggled it ripped my heart and made me realize how precious family really is. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all the other Replys are equally as fun and emotional, but Reply 1988 really hit me hard.. I highly recommend!",

I mean the chill and anti-antagonistic feels of the drama is perfect for these trying times but come on. 12 episodes aint enough.

Although some may think that it's slow, but the slice of life moments are the ones that draw me in because they're so relatable! It's not just applicable in the hospital, but we go through many of these moments in our friendships/ work. (For example Chu Min-ha's overworking and covering her colleague's slack while being underappreciated was so relatable, so many of my friends go through this too!) \n\nOn top of it, it's refreshing to see actors play their instruments for real (and you can tell on their faces how much they actually love playing together!). I usually look forward to those scenes. \n\nI love prison playbook too!! I chanced upon it and found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would when I first started! Chemistry between cell mates were so good and hilarious. \n\nHowever, I personally felt like I couldn't appreciate the Reply series as much because I did not understand the references. Wish I could though, it would have made the series more enjoyable!",

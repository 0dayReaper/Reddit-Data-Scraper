It\u2019s kinda cute seeing them being jealous or acting like a bickering couple. Now we just need her to admit she likes him already \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d  let this poor boy finally break out of his unrequited love era\n\nthere is so much going in this plot! So many suspicious people. In the hospital, &gt;!at first I only suspected the sketchy/incompetent nurse. And the fact that the police chased mystery motorbike man to the hospital and ran into nurse guy, it\u2019s very telling\u2026 buuut, what if it\u2019s just a red herring? My theory is that it\u2019s gonna turn out that dude is just negligent and stealing drugs. The real murderer and mastermind is someone else, and now the angel doctor is looking sus\u2026 plus, what is going with that older lady nurse? She is giving off so many sinister vibes, how is she involved in this? !&lt;\n\nI heavily suspected cop dad but so far it seems like he\u2019s just using the junior detective to keep tabs on the investigation. But who knows\u2026\n\nand ofc, the school violence. &gt;!I really hope that little boy\u2019s noona is alive, he already lost his parents. A big L for the friend for keeping quiet so far, I hope she spills the beans next episode. Yes, ik, her life was threatened but still. What a mess.!&lt;\n\nEp. 6: &gt;!I thought the school violence was gonna end in such a dark place, thank God it didn't happen. When the boy's noona showed up as a spirit, I got so scared...!&lt; \n\nWhy is Ji-hyun just able to touch things now? First it was the most forced accidental kiss, &gt;!now it's straight up saving Youngmin....!&lt; Why does it come and go? I hope it's not just for plot convenience... Hopefully for Youngmin's love life, maybe she's still alive and that's why she's able to have an effect on the physical world. Ofc, that other dude was able to save his pregnant widow while still being completely dead so who knows.\n\nI hope the writers are not tricking me, but I'm calling it,&gt;! the doctor is some sort of serial killer. He murdered Jihyun's friend and later used Jihyun's crush on him as a way to kill her as well. The other sus nurse lady is either doing her own shit or involved with his crimes. And Idk, something makes me still suspect Jihyun's dad. He seems to know something.!&lt;",

Our FL's was investigating her best friend's suspicious death after an ER visit.  Somehow our ML's mother was involved in the investigation.  The doctor, who is also the mysterious motorcyclist killed both women.!&lt;",

Both appears too nice from the outside, but there real face comes out when cornered.\n\nOne can see how agitated he was when was cornered by that male nurse. \n\nThat's why I think there is more to his story. He simply can't be in the drama for being a \"nice guy\".\n\nAlso, he belongs to some rich family. So, it's strange to see him in this demanding job as an ER doctor when he could've been anywhere more comfortable. My guess is this gives him more opportunity to murder people without being detected, like injecting them with something.",

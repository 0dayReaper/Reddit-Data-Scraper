For some reason romcoms seem to have disappeared, even though they were the ones that attracted majority of the international audience to Kdramas in the first place. So I am glad to see another romcom coming up now that Bo Ra! Deborah is about to wrap up. Star Struck looks good too. Will be checking out both.",

Theres different shades in the spectrum of rom coms but the era of vibes like the humor and romance found in stuff like my love from the star or legend of the blue sea is like a lost art now. \n\nWe have rom coms but that genre now turns out to be similar to stuff that\u2019s found in Dr Cha, where it\u2019s an added pallet to the overall story. They\u2019ll mix it in with some kind of angst, revenge etc, and when they do slip in the rom com vibes it\u2019s not written with the same \u201cba da boom tisk\u201d landing. I feel it\u2019s just a different era now where comedy and romance is different. \n\nBut yea lol it also feels like they go into a rotation phase with genres. Last year it felt like there were a lot of doctor and legal shows. Now we have Interest of Love",

It's how I find my taste twins and 'signal posts' (users where I know their taste so their ratings gave me a good idea of whether the drama is for me).",

(Mostly I try to avoid raining on a *relative* newbie's parade when they are gushing about a kdrama they love when the drama is on my *not-so-good* list.) \n\nI stalked your MDL. Based on how you've rated the romcoms/romances I've also watched, I think you might like **20th Century Boy and Girl**, **My Unfamiliar Family**, and **Eccentric! Chef Moon**. All three have romances but are also focused on family dynamics and character development/growth. Sorta like 'coming-of-age' stories but for characters in their 30s as they 'truly' get the hang of adulting.\n\nMy [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/mywei) for context.",

Here's the link, if you're interested: [https://sheet.zoho.com.au/sheet/open/r3ctt8955b3d174294c6e9b41f0b8fb834a95](https://sheet.zoho.com.au/sheet/open/r3ctt8955b3d174294c6e9b41f0b8fb834a95)\n\nI recently created an account with MDL, but am not going to add all the shows I've watched. I haven't been using it a lot, and I think will mostly use it for being aware of upcoming series and finding the details I want about shows, like actors, characters' names, etc., and for rating in a more specific way than I can on Viki. Do you have a detailed watch history there, though?\n\nI do find it interesting to know what others like/etc., for the same reasons. For example, I've noticed that most of the people who comment a lot on this subreddit tend to have pretty different tastes to me, so that influences how I take their recommendations and reviews. It also makes those who do like similar types of shows, and things in shows, stand out, because I know I can depend more on that.",

She did have very swollen eyes last week at the airport last week. Although that might have been something else. BP's schedule has been crazy plus with all the brand commitments it must take its toll on performers. I really want her to get better and get some rest. And hope she is well in time for BST Hyde park.\n\nI finished **Joseon Attorney** and it got really good towards the end. I wasn't too invested in the cases early on in the drama, but in the second half characters got good development and the story got intense with some good writing. Satisfactory ending. I give it 8/10.\n\nI started **A Love So Beautiful** on a whim. Watched one episode. Cutesy so far although FL betrer change her ways real soon.\n\nI also started **Go Back Couple**. It's good although a lot of frustration in the first episode. It's not a particular judgement on this particular drama, But I have seen quite a few shows (not just Korean) where FL feels she misses out on life (i.e. being a career woman) because she had children and her Husband is a bit of a jerk. Interestingly I haven't seen many plotlines where it's the opposite i.e. women having careers and missed out on the chance to have children. Not a judgement though, just an observation. \n\nAs we tiptoe towards summer I have planted my herbs and vegetables. It's only been 4 days but I am impatient and want to see plants grow lol.",

Both highly recommended if you are looking for something short, sweet and fluffy. \n\nTo.Jenny has a simple story about a shy guy reconnecting with his high school crush. The plot isn\u2019t worth mentioning, but the show\u2019s real highlight is its fantastic soundtrack. Now I know Kim Seung Cheol is an amazing singer as well as a memorable character actor! Also has Lee Sangyi which was a bonus I wasn\u2019t expecting.\n\nLet\u2019s Meet in an Unfamiliar Season is about a man and a woman who build a deep connection as quarantine centre neighbours. The romance develops naturally and nothing feels hurried despite this just running for 1 hour. I would have watched this as a full format drama, but am also happy that I got the pay out in such a short time.",

At the moment, I'm only allowing myself to become emotionally invested in my darling beautiful sweet Mi Joo. This way I can watch the rest of the cast repeating this constant I'm Doing This Terrible Ill-Advised Trauma-Inducing Thing FOR YOU Despite Not Considering Your Wishes Or Any Long-Term Unintended Emotional Ramifications!!! cycle with only mild concern. I'm gonna let the full story play out and see how the drama handles the send off before truly weighing in on the themes and characters. way too much to unpack without seeing the writer's last word on the matter.\n\n**Delightfully Deceitful** has lots of promise - the cast is fantastic and all the characters have a nice reversal charm feel about them. hopefully it executes well and doesn't get toooooo crazy. it totally has the potential to go super off the rails though, so we shall see. I really like what Kim Dong Wook is doing with his character by offsetting the detached cynic act with his sad boii melo eyes - while all hinting at&gt;! some crazy I'll Save You masterplan? oook?!&lt; but Yoon Park is gearing up to be a show stealer. as usual! love that dude!\n\nThe Japanese drama **I Should Have Told You A Million Times** is a real heartbreaker but with enough lightness and charm not be be pure tragedy porn. Plus a really good OST. I started it on a whim and was surprised to see Shim Eun Kyung as a Korean expat doctor working in Japan. I've always wanted to see more of her work since loving her in the kdrama Money Game, but she seems to do more Japanese projects than Korean. Her Japanese accent is so cute, but the scene where she switches back to Korean was... damn why you gotta hurt me like that.",

I love seeing Woo Do-hwan and Bona as leads, as they were part of some of my favorite second leads in King Eternal Monarch and Twenty Five Twenty One. I also like the sound track thus far.",

The music is so sweeping and epic, and I just love the parallel worlds and time travel mystery (even though time travel stories always make my head hurt). \n\nI did watch **XO Kitty** which I found funny and entertaining, especially all the K-drama tropes. It was also fun recognizing the actor for Dae from 2521. I was really surprised to find that the show got such negative reviews on Reddit.",

            "comment": "So, I mentioned that I'm enjoying *Just Between Lovers* at the moment, but I want to express my ongoing frustration about something that's really annoying me in it. I'm not sure how much of it is deliberate and supposed to make me feel like that, and how much it's just an annoying thing that is wrong-headed.\n\nThe thing that's bugging me is how Seo Joo Won, Moon Soo's current boss, acts towards her, and how her parents respond to him, contrasted with their reaction to Kang Doo.\n\nSeo Joo Won keeps treating Moon Soo as if he deserves her, in the sense that he likes her, and that makes him deserve reciprocation. Just because he likes her. Her parents respond so positively to him, as soon as they meet him, because he's tall, and a little good-looking (he has nothing on Kang Doo, though), and dresses smartly, and owns a business. That's it. Those are the only reasons they think he's so great. And it seems he thinks the same - that because he is and has these things, she therefore should like him, and he's the right person for her.\n\n&gt;!She hasn't reciprocated, hasn't given signs that she's interested in him, and Jung Yoo Yin told him Moon Soo and Kang Doo like each other - and he's seen it - and he ingores that. He even goes in harder when Yoo Yin tells him that, inviting Moon Soo to dinner at a fancy restaurant and telling her she shouldn't be thinking of another man when he's with her, and insisting on driving her back. I really hate his sense of entitlement about her. He's overbearing, and it makes me feel icky whenever he does it. Everyone says he's a great person, and this is part of what I'm not sure about - does the show believe this, too? Is he supposed to be considered actually this great person, or are they showing us his sliminess, in this sense, to give the lie to that? To show that he's not perfectly lovely, and shouldn't be acting like that? I hope it's the latter, because I'd be disappointed in this show that I like so much, if it's the former. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kang Doo is the man. He's good, through and through, cares genuinely and purely about Moon Soo, is generous and thoughtful and compassionate to everyone but the bullies, knows how to do things, perseveres despite his problems - which he doesn't really talk about or make obvious - and just tries to look after all the people, even though he has practically nothing and is in pain all the time. He took care of Moon Soo in the collapse, and he does it now. Yet her parents reject him out of hand, because he looks a bit scruffy and isn't rich. That's it. They fail to notice that he and Moon Soo are perfect for each other - that they can give each other what they both need, and will help each other to heal and actually be happy. !&lt;They can transform the story of each other's lives!\n\nAt least Moon Soo knows it. And I know Kang Doo is going to realise it again, too. But the thing with Seo Joo Won's attitude to her is bugging me so much \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude24!",

Including parents that respond positively based on the 'qualifications' of the guy regardless of whether their daughter has positive/affectionate feelings or not.\n\nSome people, including parents and the persons themselves, will think their 'specs' necessarily leads to (romantic) admiration. I haven't seen it so much in recent dramas but the idea of marrying based on status was much more of a prominent theme a decade ago and thus marrying on 'specs' of the potential partner was definitely a thing. It's basically a few steps away from arranged marriage.\n\nI'm Chinese and I've definitely heard the 'aim for the best specs and emotions will follow' spiel from the older generation in terms of how they want me to approach marriage. I've also come across a person or two that acted like Seo Joo Won where they thought their specs meant that I should feel a certain way about them. So I think the drama is just being 'realistic' in its portrayal of certain kinds of people. \n\n&gt; does the show believe this, too?\n\nI feel like the final pairing of the show answers this question does it not? If the show really 'believed' it -- then wouldn't he be the ML?",

That's why I wonder whether the show knows this; it isn't been made really clear, yet, that it's not okay. They other guy is the one she likes, and they're really meant to be together, so her boss's behaviour isn't the reason she doesn't like or choose him.",

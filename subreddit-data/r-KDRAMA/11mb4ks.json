    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

I\u2019ve watched other shows with supernatural/long living characters that are jaded and alienated from humanity but they still have engaging personalities.  \n\nHe\u2019s great in the epilogue scenes, they should have carried more of that energy into the main show.",

I would bet that he bring out more however he\u2019s a \u201cpretty boy\u201d so subtly works for him. The ladies will glue their eyes to the screen no matter what lol \n\nIm not sure if it\u2019s his acting style or if it\u2019s in combination with his looks but Yeo Jin-Goo has a somewhat strange aura about him when he\u2019s on screen. Someone on here once said it\u2019s his face that they couldn\u2019t stand, idk what it is. He just has like a really strong face if that makes any sense. Lol. I still watch some his stuff if I like it",

Although there is so much nostalgia attached to it and it basically created so many kdrama tropes, now when I watch it I just can't unsee the extreme misogynistic actions and completely wacky borderline harassment behaviour that the show had. Like &gt;! forcefully kissing her multiple times when she resisted so hard !&lt; or like just the random bullying and yelling.   \nIts insane how much I had internalised all this as a teenager when I first began watching it ans assumed aggressive behaviour or like obsessive unrelenting stalking and stuff like that was cute and how people expressed love.",

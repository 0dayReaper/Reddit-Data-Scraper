Understanding reality basically. I'm not really a fan of dramas that promote idols. I miss dramas that actually had in depth storyline and cast that have good actors. Not revenge stories that are repeative. I want more kdramas have actors that aren't perfect and aren't afraid of correcting their flaws. I want more kdramas like Miss Old Diary as it has actors that are visually imperfect.",

Revenge dramas certainly aren't new, but lately revenge and corruption plots seem to be pushed more than other dramas. And I can't blame drama creators for following the views -- it's popular for a reason and they need to make a living.\n\nBut it's one of the frustrating things for me about kdrama -- something does well and suddenly every other drama is trying to do the same thing. And then you get these waves of dramas where every drama being about face blindness, every drama is about someone secretly being/not being a robot, or every drama being about bullying and revenge. I like them every now and again, but find them *much* too heavy and depressing to watch more than maybe 1-2 a year.\n\nIt's sad to me that people were so critical of the so called \"candy girl\" dramas because those tended to be my favorites when they were done right. A lot of them centered around themes of resilience through adversity, of family relationships and true friendships holding higher \"value\" than material things or status, and of true happiness coming from within. It's interesting to me that these themes seem to largely be done away with in kdramas. I miss those scenes in older dramas where one of the leads' family members, despite living in near-poverty, offers some small familial act of kindness to the rich opposite lead, who is moved to tears over it.\n\nI don't begrudge revenge lovers their revenge dramas -- I just wish my happy dramas were still being made, and by good writers and given good production values at the same rate as the revenge dramas!",

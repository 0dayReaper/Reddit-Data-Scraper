            "comment": "The first episode was really good! I thought it was tightly written and engaging. We jumped right into the time travel stuff without the usual lengthy exposition, and both leads' introductions were done well. There were some flashes of humour as well.\n\nI'm already getting Signal/Tunnel/Life on Mars/Come and Hug Me/W/While You Were Sleeping vibes from this drama, which is nice because I've missed this specific kind of fantasy/thriller kdrama with timeline shenanigans, with or without romance.\n\nI do wonder how and if &gt;!the present timeline was altered when Haejoon saved the two girls who were supposed to have died during the glue-sniffing incident, though. Or was the mean girl the one who should have died? In ay case, he changed his original timeline by saving someone's life, right? Or were the other two girls always already saved in his present? Because I'm pretty sure the mean one will grow up to be the nasty writer, and also I already suspect that she stole her debut novel, which Yoonyoung loves, from YY's mother. So if her two friends were originally supposed to be dead but now aren't, maybe they'll know that her career was built on a lie and pose a threat to her reputation? Which she'll try to eliminate, if she's the serial killer? But I'm still torn on whether this is the kind of drama that gives away the identity of the villain in episode one, and I'm leaning toward thinking the writer is gonna be a red herring.!&lt;\n\nAnyway, this was fun.",

I'd imagine this is going to be some sort of loop and it could well be that Hae-joon and Yoon-young decide to stay in 1987 and just send the car back to the present to make sure the timeline stays intact.

I think the writers and showrunners are taking a risk with this one (and the budget looks to have been pretty high) and I hope it pans out.  I'm okay with this type of risk taking and right now this feels like a fairly unique show.\n\nLooking forward to Ep3!",

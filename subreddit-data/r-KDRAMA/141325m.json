Another nail biter of an ending so can't wait for Monday's episode.  \n\nQuestions and thoughts:\n\nI'm glad Jae Yi and Kang Hoo FINALLY got together.  I was getting tired of nothing happening beyond them eating ramen. \n\nAnd YAY for Yoo Jung getting&gt;! the memory cards.  Why would she want them destroyed though without even checking them?  It does answer my concerns about Daddy Dearest.  Learning he was the one turning off CCTV both 10 years ago and today made me wonder.!&lt;\n\nI laughed when Leo called his host bar friend \"Hyun Bin\".  I know waiters and such often use celebrity names (ML's friend \"Obama\" in The City Hall and Goblin's Sunny and her friend deciding Grim Reaper is a waiter when he tells them his name is Kim Woo Bin) but this definitely felt like a call back to \"My Name is Kim Sam Soon/My Lovely Sam Soon\" where KSA and HB were an iconic couple. \n\nI love love love Leo.  He could have been a user but he truly is devoted to his Noona.\n\nQuestion:  Why is Yoo Jung hiding her blood type?  I'm guessing she fears donating could create problems with her high-risk pregnancy, which would make sense.",

Conceptually, Jae Yi embracing intimacy after her trauma is one of the most poignant parts of this soap. In actuality, I don't feel that writers spent enough time developing this couple's backstory (just how did he go from one friend to the other again?) and the actors don't have as much chemistry as I would like.",

    "postText": "Hey fellow fans! I am sure this has been brought up before, but I'm new to this sub, and to the fandom in general.\n\nWhat are some of the K-drama tropes that most interesting in your opinion, in regard to how they reflect the cultural norms, standards, and psyche of Korean society?\n\nUnfortunately I have only been to Korea in person once. I have two good Korean friends, though, and we have talked about poor-girl-meets-rich-boy trope a fair bit, and saying how this reflects a very traditional Confucianism gender roles.\n\nI'm curious to see if this has changed in recent years, with more shows having this power balance reversed (Rich girl meets poor boy). Do you see this shift happening gradually over the years? Are there titles that you can think of where this happens?\n\nTwo other tropes I'm very interested in is the class division (related to the above in romantic relationships), but also the bullying. Having just recently watched The Glory and currently watching True Beauty, then doing some google searches, I'm shocked to see that bullying is so common both on and off screen. Very sad. \n\nany other tropes you want to point out and talk about? Maybe the piggyback trope? (where does this come from anyway?) etc etc. Looking forward to hearing your answers!",

            "comment": "1. I\u2019ll expand your mention of the piggyback trope just to talk about blackout drinking in general (since the person being piggybacked is often drunk). I\u2019ve never seen a kdrama address someone who is trying to reduce their drinking, seek help for alcoholism, etc. despite the frequent affectionate portrayals of people drinking at work meetings or with their friends to the point of losing consciousness. I\u2019d like to tease out how much of this is a media exaggeration or plot contrivance vs. how much is an accurate portrayal of a behavior that appears to be widely accepted.\n\n2. The White Truck of Doom. Are drivers that bad? Are pedestrian deaths that high? Should I be afraid to cross the street? Or is it just purely a trope/plot contrivance?",

They go for work drinks and everyone is encouraging each other to drink but as soon as he mentions he doesn't drink, they all respectfully accept it and offer to pour him a soda instead. Just a very refreshing take on the usual force-alcohol-on-your-subordinate scenes K-dramas often have. Overall a very heartwarming drama so was very fitting :)\n\nI will note that Summer Strike does show the very ugly side of alcohol although I don't think they ever really conclude that plotline in a satisfying way.",

It was actually a big thing for him and when he moved to North America for work he basically stopped drinking with work colleagues entirely because he hated being forced to drink so much in SK his whole young adult life. He also once brought 85% ethanol alcohol to one of my  parties and when I was like 'who drinks this??' he said 'oh it's what we all drank in Korea' and downed like 15 shots of the stuff and was fine.  \n\n\nThat being said I have seen scenes in a few dramas where people talk about wanting to drink less etc., I just don't think that 'alcoholism' is defined as broadly as it is in the West as anyone who drinks a lot/frequently and I also don't think heavy drinking is seen as problematic to the same degree. You see lots of scenes with people saying they want to stop drinking because they don't want to have a hangover in the morning etc. and I have seen a few ex-alcoholic characters here and there in dramas. But since it is seen as a social necessity/good in many cases, of course it won't be depicted negatively overall.  \n\n\nI guess contrast this to how marijuana is depicted in Kdrama (or even tobacco smoking, until recently/cable channels) versus in US or Canadian TV shows. Koreans would be completely horrified by the casual, cute, happy portrayal of 'stoner lifestyles' in many American shows but it is far more culturally normalized in the West.",

About constantly going to the hospital, it is exaggerated in dramas, but still common, because normally most doctors offices are located in the hospital as well. So while in America you have \"doctor's offices\" where you go for scheduled visits, \"urgent care\" or \"walk in clinics\" where you go for things that need immediate treatment but are not too extreme either, and hospitals where you go for emergencies, surgeries, and long term treatments. But in Korea all of that is located at the hospital so they'd just say \"go to the hospital.\"",

You have to pay for medical care in Korea, so I think this is probably a misrepresentation.  Unless people routinely have work insurance that covers the portion they need to pay.  Also, I get the sense (from my very brief googling) that they have similar issues with overcrowded ER in Korea as in other parts of the world.  So this sort of reinforces the idea that this is just dramaland and not reality.   Who wants to go to the hospital and wait 6 hours just to have a cold or a scratch treated?\n\nAnother thing I have noticed and wondered about is the prevalence of IV drips for every little thing.  In Doctor Cha, one of the characters (Doctor) asked for an IV drip because he was feeling unwell.  I often see characters going to the hospital for, as you say every little thing, and ending up on an IV drip and being told to finish it before going home\n\nETA And while we are on the subject, another thing that makes me wonder is the scene where someone is admitted on a stretcher and you see them run at top speed down the hall.  I wonder just how often that happens.  You would think only when the person is just about to die.  Probably something else that is for dramatic effect",

The action is identical in every case - a close up shot of someone clenching their fist. But how impactful it is depends on the set up and the context. \n\nIf we are highly invested in the characters and the narrative, the clenched fist trope can enhance our feelings of empathy towards the character in question. If on the other hand, if we are less invested in the drama, the action will likely come across as just another appearance of this trope.",

When they're facing challenges, I put myself in their shoes and try to think of what they should do, so if the writers have them solve the problem in a way that I didn't think of, I find it delightful. \n\nI also really enjoy unexpected strengths. Like when a character is really young but has mastered some difficult skill, or a character is small and feminine but can beat up a room full of big guys.\n\nThe trope of a character thrust into a new situation and being initially disliked by everyone around them, but slowly winning them over so that they become so endeared to those around them that the other people would go to any lengths to help the person they originally disdained.\n\nI like it when it's revealed that \"the bad guy\" actually has an understandable motivation for their evil deeds and isn't just a one-dimensional character.\n\nWhen it's implied that the reason for all of the main character's struggles is because of some horrific mistake they made in the past and it's finally revealed and it turns out it *really was* a bad mistake. I probably wouldn't enjoy this one so much if it wasn't for the fact that 99% of kdramas always disappoint me so much with revealing the \"mistake\" to be something completely innocuous like \"main lead forgot their phone somewhere, so their depressed friend was unable to reach them one time\" rather than a real mistake like \"main lead took revenge on an innocent person because they had the same name as the one who really deserved it\".",

The [r/Kdrama Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_honorifics_and_speech_levels) has a basic guide to honorific levels/address, and you can use Google Translate or Papago for pronunciation/auditory recognition help. \n\nThere are also some Kdramas where it's very evident (and makes it into the subtitles) because it's an important dynamic in the relationship of the characters. Like:\n\n* **Chicago Typewriter**: Memorable argument between FL and ML where she rescinds his permission to speak with her informally and doesn't let him forget it; later, sweet scenes of address negotiation. Also a running gag between ML and SML where ML insists on SML being formal because he's technically an employee &gt;!even though they're old friends.!&lt;\n\n* **I Hear Your Voice**: *Princess Bride*-esque linguistic misunderstanding where ML uses banmal/[\ub2f9\uc2e0](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EB%8B%B9%EC%8B%A0#Usage_notes) (as an endearment) to address FL; she assumes he's being rude and calls him a series of unflattering nicknames until she figures it out. Also has address/formality discussion at key points in the relationship between the leads.",

It's one of few noona romances with almost no use of the titular honorific.\n\n**MLs Nicknames/Address for FL:**\n\n* \ub2f9\uc2e0/*dangsin*: Atypical 2nd person pronoun that can be used as an old-fashioned term of endearment between people who are familiar, usually translated as dear/darling. Also considered a very rude way to address someone without honorifics.\n* \uc9f1\ubcc0/*jjang byeon* (awesome/amazing lawyer): A play on FL's surname (Jang) and her professional title.\n\n**FLs Nicknames/Address for ML:**\n\n* \uc560/*ae* (contraction of \uc544\uc774/child): Slang for someone younger. Can be endearing.  \n* \ubc25\ud1b5\uc544/*baptong-a* (rice pot + vocative marker): Dummy. Somewhat cutesy/affectionate. \n* \uc790\uc2dd/*jasig* (offspring): Rude slang for someone younger. Can be endearing, but usually not.\n* \uaecc\ub531\uc9c0/*kkeomttagji* (dried up chewing gum): Because he's stuck to her.\n\n**Episode Guideline**\n\n* EP01: When ML writes in his diary to FL at the end and narrates it, he uses banmal/\ub2f9\uc2e0.\n* EP02: ML practices several forms of address in the mirror, including noona (polite) and given name+ssi (very forward from someone younger). When ML and FL meet, ML instead defaults to banmal/\ub2f9\uc2e0 and FL scolds him for being a rude, informal \uc790\uc2dd. She starts calling him \uaecc\ub531\uc9c0/\uc790\uc2dd/\uc560 in retaliation.\n* EP04: &gt;!ML finally introduces himself when he sleeps over; FL refuses to address him by his name (super rude by Korean standards!) and keeps calling him \uaecc\ub531\uc9c0/\uc790\uc2dd/\uc560.!&lt;\n* EP05: &gt;!FL makes ML address her formally at the police station to fake their relationship; it's the only time he calls her noona. She tells him to keep using jondaemal/noona back at the house, but he refuses.!&lt;\n* EP06: &gt;!FL adds a more endearing insult - \ubc25\ud1b5\uc544 - to her line-up. She calls ML by his given name for the first time when she rushes back to the apartment to hide him from the police.!&lt;\n* EP08: &gt;!FL calls ML \uc218\ud558\uc57c (given name + vocative marker) for the first time as an apology after their fight, which is a very affectionate form of address. FL calls ML \uc218\ud558\uc57c again at the aquarium, which is why he turns back. He addresses her as \ub2f9\uc2e0 when he confesses; pretty sure this is when she figures out it's an endearment.!&lt;\n* EP09: &gt;!FL scolds ML's teddy bear for speaking informally with her; it calls her \uc9f1\ubcc0, her nickname.!&lt;\n* EP10: &gt;!FL and ML speak formally at the police station and FL complains how awkward it is; they discuss his past informality. TML comments during his visits on how disgustingly romantic ML's diary is because of his use of banmal/\ub2f9\uc2e0.!&lt;\n* EP13: &gt;!ML starts using banmal/\ub2f9\uc2e0 again. FL questions him about it, and he formally asks for permission to address her familiarly. She gives it, and starts calling him \uc218\ud558\uc57c again in return.!&lt;\n* EP14: &gt;!FL calls ML \uc218\ud558\uc57c when she confesses; ML starts referring to FL as \uc9f1\ubcc0/her nickname around other people without the full honorific title \ubcc0\ud638\uc0ac\ub2d8/*byeonhosanim*.!&lt;",

I get that this could just be for dramatic effect but I'm always screaming at the tv 'just call the police' and left wondering if there is a general reluctance and hesitancy in real life in korea around reporting things to the police since it happens so much in dramas? \n\nAlso when I first started watching dramas I always wondered why fevers were treated like a serious illness in overall healthy adults. And also how everyone is getting fevers from just being out in the rain or over working themselves rather than from the flu or similar viruses... also how so many people got cramp in their legs whilst swimming leading to almost drowning... These two things just seemed so unusual to me to be happening 'so often' as it was every single drama. I guess these are more things tropes that writers just kept going with to move the romance forward though rather than being korean people are more prone to illnesses. Luckily dramas are less repetitive these days.",

I have recently started watching Work Later, Drink Now and I was appalled at their level of drinking and eating. Also during those drinking sessions, the type of food eaten/paired with alcohol always varies with economic status, e.g. Rich people pair their drinks with mostly fruit, and they usually don't drink Soju. Compared to poor/middle-class people who mostly pair their alcohol with grilled meats or convenience store food and mainly drink soju and beer.\n\nEconomic status trope- This is usually very clearly depicted in almost every kdrama and at first I was taken aback by how much wealth and education are used to set people apart. If you are poor or not well educated in Sk then you and your family are treated like trash and people will not hesitate to remind you where you belong. It's quite sad actually. Couple this with how such people also usually kneel when they are asking for something or forgiveness. Very emasculating.\n\nSocial Media-Kdramas depict this really toxic use of social media by South Koreans. Any negative story even a non-serious common one like a cheating spouse is dramatically blown up by netizens, leading to massive stock drops of companies or bad business e.g. in a *crash course in romance*. I find this type of cancel culture too much.",

How they still have well preserved hanok villages, palaces, fortresses, and so many national treasures never ceases to amaze me.\n\nBut that\u2019s just me.",

Newer dramas don't have this but uknow how there always used to be a scene where people would be running through the streets, chasing or running away from someone? and then there would obviously be bg music. some scenes I can remember are from dots, weightlifting fairy, search www etc. SO much fun!!!! I wish we could do this irl!!",

They just got in a fight, or bumped into each, or threw something at each other, and all is still fine but the second the other character spots the tiny bit of blood they freak out. Is there like a high number of body injury lawsuits ? Specially when it was just clearly an acccident, why the freak out?",

I noticed several dramas will have the ML and FL have a moment where there relationship gets closer - maybe when they fall in love, or a first kiss or confession of feelings - facing each other, snow falling in slow motion. If not snow, then cherry blossoms. Sometimes the seasons change abruptly for this type of shot.  The other thing is when the ML does something chivalrous, or saves the FL, and she starts slapping him on the shoulders, arms, etc. Moms do it as well. Then followed by a hug.",

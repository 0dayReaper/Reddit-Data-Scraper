Started watching it at night and iirc I almost finished the series by morning. \n\nNow this - starting to binge watch this (im at ep 7). It occurred to me - why is ML's beautiful wife cheating on him AGAIN?!  And why is ML civil to the cheater in this series too? Haha.\n\nSaw FL in Hotel de Luna, didnt click w/ me in a few eps and dropped it. But I enjoyed FL's performance in My Mister so far.\n\nWhen FL said \"he's nice coz he's rich\" (paraphrased) think that's true from what I see. If you're barely making ends meet and can't eat, you cant afford to think of others. But then she still is nice inside.\n\nThanks for the post - it encouraged me to pick this up again.",

            "comment": "This show is a gem.\n\nLee Sung Kyung and Kim Young Kwang both are incredibly expressive with micro expressions. Their angst, their pain, their joy, their love, and their feelings are so out in the open even when they give us a tiny pinhole size peek into their minds. The director and writers and actors are all incredible.\n\nSpecial call out to them smiling and laughing openly during the camping flashback where Dong Jin cuts her off by saying no more beers.\n\nThe entire Shim Family + Jun are so good. I am thoroughly invested in their individual and collective happiness.\n\nI also liked that Jigu, Hye Song, and their mom all can see and empathize with Woojoo\u2019s misery.\n\nFor a show about revenge, there\u2019s just so much love. Romantic love, love between a parent and her three children, love between siblings, love between life long friends, love between co-workers.\n\nThis pink beauty will go down as an all time favourite if they continue this way. \n\nDong Jin clearly telling Heeja she has to live without the house and he will right the wrong is such a cathartic moment for him. He\u2019s finally broken free from her oppressive chains.\n\nWoojoo not wanting to take any favours from Heeja\u2019s ex boyfriend was a great moment. Woojoo is a smart cookie.\n\nThis show better get nominated for many awards. It deserves acknowledgment.\n\nLastly I really liked that Dong Jin was so understanding of Woojoo\u2019s motives and he is doing whatever he can to help her. At the same time he knows how much she loves him. I am rooting for them.\n\n*Edited to add:* I can\u2019t stop thinking about how well crafted this show is.\n\nBecause of the deliberate slow pace where scenes have breathing room, we get to be able to focus on the tiniest expressions from Dong Jin and Woojoo. The blinks, the gulps, the lip quivers, how one stare is different from another, etc. It\u2019s a big pink sheet of paper and suddenly a tiny drop of blue ink falls on it. Usually we wouldn\u2019t notice it but because there\u2019s so much room around it, it stands out. That\u2019s how this show is with the acting. Tiny moments speak so loudly.",

I loved the scene where she tells him because it wasn't this dramatic betrayal scene that I thought they were building up to. Like he rightly pointed out - she didn't take her revenge. She didn't ruin him. In fact she did the opposite. Under those circumstances how could he be angry. \nEven in that interaction, woojoo was being protective... demanding a harsher response than what he was willing to give her. Protecting him even from herself. What a lovely character. She does this for all their family. It is in line with her character of just being this externally cold but inwardly warm and fiercely loving person. She is one of my fav kdrama female protagonists.",

Like Jun says, she\u2019s been miserable and carrying the weight since she was 17. How could anyone begrudge her enjoying a moment of happiness. He even calls out her delusional belief that she will break up with Dong Jin easily. He knew she needed the external pressure of her family finding out.",

The oldest sister consumed by anxiety and the pressure of being the oldest, who feels like she failed her siblings by being weak minded. The mother who was ill later on but before that, disappeared when her kids needed her the most, consumed by the pain and anxiety of her husband\u2019s betrayal. The FL who felt like the world was on her shoulders and that happiness never would be hers again. The brother who feels guilty for how immature he has been, but really doesn\u2019t see that in normal circumstances it would be okay at his age to chase his dreams. \n\nAnd then we have ML, who wow, I feel so bad for him because aside from the man who was his stepfather and took him camping, he has been so incredibly lonely. You really finally hear from him how badly his mother treated him, &gt;!leaving him alone for days as a child while she pursued a married man.!&lt; She failed him in so many ways, neglected and abused him, and never apologized for it. In fact, she continued to torture him and destroyed his personal relationships. His life revolved around the destructive hurricane that was his mother. When he said he never even called her mother then, I had tears in my eyes. \n\nThe actor did such a good job in that heartbreaking scene. He was brave for telling his mother the truth about their relationship. He did what FL encouraged him to do in past scenes - fight back. \n\nIt also makes the audience understand why a son would be willing to help the family his mother wronged, even if it means she might go to jail.\n\nThe writing like you said is excellent. The pacing is perfect, side storylines have mostly wrapped up and well. Amazing.",

She acted the most child like and immature. Every episode we got to see more and more of her and now in these last episodes she suddenly feels like the eldest and even her eyes and body language carries this weariness but also solidity, like she has picked up the baton dropped by woojoo. \n\nI also loved the interaction between Jun and Jigu on the couch while watching baseball. Even Jigu has grown up and discovers the depth of his love for his sister. I just felt like reaching in and patting him on his head ... oh jiguya.. you're all grown up.\n\nFinally, I am so grateful for quiet crying scene. I have never met a person whole wails loudly like I see them do in a lot of kdramas. I loved the scene were he hugs her as she cries and then she gives him more bad news. It's just the most realistic and heart wrenching scenes. Or him crying quietly in his car on his way to the fair.  Beautiful.",

She wasn't going to leave them for the ML but she still wanted to make sure he was OK. He had taken first priority. She was willing to let him go out of guilt but her priorities are different now. That's the baton I had meant.\n\nAlso, now am wondering if all this wasn't just self-imposed. She took on so much responsibility even though no one asked her to. Do we all like her more for doing that? \n\nIt's the same for the ML. So much of his suffering is self-imposed. I really hope the ML fights for her healing the way she fought for his.",

Yes, she shows a new determination in making plans to move out and figuring out how to fund it, but this isn't motivated by what's happening with the family so much as it is motivated by her feelings about Jun. She is angry and jealous that Jun chose to be most loyal to Woo Joo, and so she is punishing him by separating him from the only 'family' he loves.   \nAnd that slap?

            "comment": "**Episode 13 and 14**\n\nThis show\u2026they have perfected the melancholic tone without being preachy, over the top or unrealistic, and although most of the time my wish for works of fiction is to take me away from the rigmarole of real life, I truly truly appreciate it when a writer, actors and a film crew deliver to us what serves as an almost mirror to life. \n\nEvery character on this show has their own battles, their own struggles which manifest differently yet they\u2019re all good people (minus she who must not be named) which makes it so much harder because you\u2019re constantly heartbroken for them. You understand where each of them is coming from, you wish it didn\u2019t have to be so and you hope that they could just lead decent, respectful, comfortable lives with peace thrown in abundance and the occasional moment of joy. \n\nLast week, my only wish for the show was for someone to hug Woojoo and for that someone to be Dongjin\u2026&gt;!alas, they delivered possibly the most wonderfully portrayed painful hug that had love, sadness, understanding, protection, and escapism all rolled into one!&lt;. \n\nI\u2019m simply in awe of both of them. If they don\u2019t get nominated for awards and win them I will be shocked. With no hysterics, no over the top movements they delivered the heaviness of the heart so well because it was mixed in with relief that the ticking \u201cbombshell\u201d was finally out of the bag and that was one less burden for Woojoo to carry. \n\nIt\u2019s so telling that the only time Dongjin has been animated is when she was hurt physically which anyone would, yet watching him and her through these two episodes is what makes you understand the depth of their feelings. \n\nHow bittersweet to realize how much you love each other when you\u2019re having to let go. That the siblings understand this is so telling of their dynamics and how what gets portrayed externally is not always a reflection of how we feel internally. \n\nHaesung\u2019s character arc has also been so fascinating. To be somewhat mentally \u201cchecked out\u201d from the family matters because she\u2019s spent preceding years in a constant state of worry, only to be \u201crudely\u201d brought back to reality to try and take control of their ship as the oldest has been so poignant to watch. I love that she was honest about her feelings with Joon. I love that she was able to understand her own feelings and communicate them with such care and no bitterness. I hope someday these two can find their way to each other because Joon\u2019s on the slowest journey ever to figuring himself out. \n\nJigu continues to show maturity and like others I really enjoyed his scene with Joon. \n\nOne other element of realism I love about this show is how they show everyone carrying on with life. In reality we can be dealt with the worst things and news and yet most of us have to find the strength and fortitude to get up, eat, go to work and live up to our obligations. No wallowing in the darkness here or drinking away to glory during the day time/work hours (which is even more apparent when you contrast that with Minyoung whose exact problem was this, coming from a life where money is not an issue and you have the luxury to only sit with your sadness and emotions all day long). \n\nSpecial shout out to Haesung\u2019s coworker friend who always just has an odd line or two but always gives the best most sound advice. Again, so so thoughtful to include such minor characters and moments. It\u2019s what I love most about the show, you can see that the writer and director have been deliberate and considerate of each and everything. \n\nIf this were my story to tell, I\u2019d find a way to end it with a scene reminiscent of when he was having the breakfast she made after their night together, except this time it would be in real time and she\u2019d actually be cooking as he sat at the table peaceful and content, sipping on coffee waiting to eat breakfast together\u2026\n\nETA: So I obviously can\u2019t stop thinking about the show. I hope that step 1 of Dongjin not simply accepting life and learning to live with it (which was him &gt;!confronting Heeja!&lt;) will be followed by him doing his version of fighting for his and Woojoo\u2019s love. It\u2019s high time somebody look out for her happiness and hers alone, and we know he\u2019s the one to do it.",

Then I went to read further articles about KYK explaining that acting in this show made him realised that he really wanted to step out of his comfort zone and take on new type of roles. I guess he finally realise his acting talent should be expanded to other tv show genres. \n\nAlso LSK\u2019s skill in conveying quiet panic is so funny!! Cue her colleague exclaiming in disbelief that she\u2019s quitting, \u201cDid you break up with CEO Han!?\u201d. WJ must have died inside\u2026 \ud83e\udee0 and LSK did well in conveying WJ\u2019s style of panicking. \n\nI like how this show touch on a lot of grey areas in life- it tries to show you perspectives from both sides and are not overly preachy. Like they try to explain siblings JG and HS\u2019s perspectives on why they act the way they do in a very realistic manner.\n\nI\u2019m just in awe and wondering why this show managed to stay so awesome as most kdramas always start off great and die midway.

Especially for someone who for all intents and purposes is an emotionally distraught teenager who's only support network is Jun. (Sadly, had she made better choices, she could have turned to Sunwoo and Ms Baek, as I believe both of them would have been positive both towards her and her relationship with Dongjin. But easy to say when not in their shoes).\n\nI think it is actually realistic that Woojoo's entire identity is one of maintaining the family, and it is not easy to simply give up one's own identity.\n\nAnyway, that's how I see it.",

You do you, I do me.\n\nBoth have its pro and con.\n\nBut in the context of WJ the sister etc., I think what they each do are thoroughly in line with the culture/values they grow up with. As much as \"modern\" sensibility forces you to do one thing over another, it's not an easy thing to confront your psychological mould and adjust. Even then, it could be a subtle change not a 180.

She should have help then move one and deal with the trauma instead of letting them living this way.",

And I've been enjoying reading all your comments afterwards.\n\nRegarding the last words spoken by Hyeon-ju (mom of the Shim siblings) in the preview:\n\n*\"No matter how much time has passed that took me to open and close my eyes. Even if it seems heartless, that's the only thing that can be said.\"*\n\nIt could be out of context, but that seems mis-translated. The more accurate translation would be:\n\n*\"No matter what terrible times those years were, one can still get over it in what seems like a blink of an eye. Even if it sounds heartless, that is the only thing I can tell you.\"*\n\nAlthough we don't know the context of her words, I think she is talking to Woo-joo. And because Korean sentences can be formed without a subject, these are my guesses:\n\n(1) Mom is telling Woo-joo that she was able to get over those bad times when she was sad about their father's infidelity. So since she has recovered, she can look past the fact that Dong-jin is Hee-ja's son.\n\n(2) Mom is telling Woo-joo that she will one day get over her heartbreak of losing Dong-jin.\n\nObviously, I am hoping for #1. Woo-dong couple, fighting!",

            "comment": "I am starting to think that they will end up together despite what they have been leading us to believe. I have been speculating a sad ending just from what i have seen.\n\nThis is not just WJ's love it is her first love!!!! First kiss most likely. Now they are lovers! She has probably only been with him and he knows that. Her bond with him is STRONG! You never forget your first love or lover. He was starting to show a bit of dominance towards her when he told her to wait for him at the office. He was all in as her man 100 percent! \n\nI actually think he is very mad at Sunwoo for speaking to her at all about anything. He was not happy when he was treating her coldly. I think that is part of the reason he will leave the company. He crossed a line with him and though I feel he forgives him. He will take some time away from him. \n\nHere is why I think they are endgame.\n\nThere were two stills released a long time ago. They have never showed those scenes yet. In the stills WJ and DJ are both in a crowd looking at each other most likely. She is in a blue sweater and he is in a grey turtleneck and blazer.\n\n\nAt first I thought this is going to be the end scene and as described in the episode descriptions those stills fit that description.\n\nBUT! I saw some behind the scenes photos where they were consistently showing when the actors shot their scenes on their last day they would be given flowers and the actors that worked in those scenes would take a photo with those who held the flowers. I saw a pattern here. Two of the photos shown had WJ and DJ in the blue sweater and grey turtleneck and blazer like in the prior stills. Jigu was in one of those photos HOLDING FLOWERS! That meant it was his last shot. BUT WJ AND DJ WERE NOT HOLDING FLOWERS IN THOSEbehind the scenes PHOTO with Jigu or others where tjey wore those clothes! Which means those stills are most likely from the end of episode 15 to beginning of episode 16! I have dreaded those scenes the stills came from. It just looked so final and sad.\n\nMy prediction and why...\n\nIn episode 13 DJ talked to someone at the fair that seemed interested in recruiting him to work over seas. I know they showed that scene for a reason. I think DJ will leave the company and take the offer overseas. Afrer a time jump I think he will return for whatever reason. His Uncle will take the apt back and DJ may take over running the campground. Also I think after what happened with MY he won't give up so easily with out a fight. I think he knows if he gives them so distance and he comes back everyone will accept them much easier. \n\nOne other observation DJ removed the tent from his apt before they were together. Disney gave away those special keep sake lamps of their silhouettes sitting in the tent. It is also in the title sequence where she lovingly touches him like they are already in love. I always thought that image would be revealed to be them sitting in the tent in his apt. But he took the tent down in his apt so it has to be them at that campground in the future.\n\nI predict they will be in that tent again at the campground and that will be the ending. Maybe their will be an epilogue but I think they will reunite at the campground.",

But it does leave a bitter taste in my mouth for the haesung x Jun ship.\n\nI love the lack of love triangles and the honest portrayal of platonic relationships between men and women",

(And if anyone is wondering whether she enjoyed that night, the show writers certainly gave a hint with the title of the book behind them on the window sill in his apartment, when they first kissed).",

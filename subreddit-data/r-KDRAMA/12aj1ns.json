            "comment": "I agree that this show is objectively not very \"good.\" It's extremely unsophisticated and ham-fisted by 2023 standards. It takes place in the 1980s but it also feels like it was made in the 1980s. Even the comic beats and the dialogue feel so old-fashioned.\n\nBut I think the old-fashioned vibe is intentional. Like the exaggerated comic reactions of \"the gang\" when the leads kiss. In 2023, a kissing scene in a drama is not a big deal. But in the 1980s, it was scandalous. So seeing Doo-hak's friends lose their cool because they saw their boss kissing a lady was hilarious. You can actually see the actors trying not to crack up.\n\nLike that scene where Doo-hak hugs his buddies at the port - in slo-mo with blaring dramatic music - HAHAHA, I laughed so hard. It's supposed to be a very sad scene, but you just laugh.\n\nSo I do enjoy this show, but only by leaning into the ridiculous oldies vibe. It almost feels like a parody of old Kdramas from the 1980s. And seeing the story play reminds me - oh yeah, they didn't have CCTVs on every street. And there was no genetic testing to prove that someone was not actually your son.\n\nOh, did Doo-hak get stabbed? Or shot? Doo-hak is like the Terminator. He'll just come back to life anyway. So I'll just laugh some more.\n\nWhat feels fresh and new - Jeong-shin. I love an independent, fierce lady who kicks ass and calls her own shots. That feels very 2023 to me.\n\nWow, Cheol-woong is really such a little \\*&amp;\\^%! That's certainly an old-fashioned thing - for a guy to keep pursuing a girl after she's made herself clear multiple times that she is not into him.\n\nI was honestly sad about Doo-hak's father. What did Yeo-jin think this would accomplish? Is she also going to kill Doo-hak's mother, too? I can't wait for all this to blow up in her face.",

I personally really like the show and will definitely see it to the end, but leading up to the debut, I had a different expectation on what I thought the presentation of it would be like. For example Reborn Rich started in the 70s? I think, and just the delivery was still up to 2023 expectations. I honestly thought it was going to be of that caliber in delivery and presentation but it\u2019s not. \n\nI feel like this is a somewhat lower budget show that the actors and actresses got a chance to take the lead on. It almost has a theater play type atmosphere. I think they are doing the best they can with what they have. \n\nHowever a good point that you made was that it kind of has a feel as if it was made in the 1980s. After watching episode 10, I cant unsee that comment. Maybe it\u2019s done on purpose. Who knows..",

Especially after that amazing kissing in Our Dating Sim...sigh.\n\nThese two episodes made me incredibly happy but I feel they shortened the wrong bits from the manwha to the live action. By that I mean we should have seen a bit more of the cold shoulder from Tae Joon. He had a justifiable reason for doing it, and while he said it, I don't think it was clear or obvious in the live action at all. Furthermore, Won Young's revelation that he likes Tae Joon like that wasn't done as well as it was in the manwha either. Here he just stumbled into it clumsily, in the manwha it was literally a light coming on, which is a very different feel. \n\nLooks like one more episode of happiness before the s- hits the fan with all the lies from both sides. That's a lot of angst to shove into the final 3 episodes. Which means more shortened storyline. Sigh. That part is the saddest but most interesting part about them coming together. I still love this show but have my doubts on the pacing right now. Probably should have shortened it a bit on the front end instead of the back end like I suspect they have done. There is a lot of story to still cover. \n\nI am happy how faithful this is to the manwha. The actors and the story are doing a bang up job with that. And it is a beautifully shot drama, so points for that as well.",

I didn't quite understand it from the episode.. just assumed he was disappointed that Wonyoung left? \n\nI agree that Wonyoung's revelation was a bit underwhelming and I didn't really like the literal stumble into Taejoon's arms at the end of ep 6. I was hoping he would be a bit more desperate to get it off his chest.",

In summary &gt;!TaeJoon hasn\u2019t actually told WonYoung he\u2019s gay! Not only that but TaeJoon could see that WonYoung liked him and that WonYoung hadn\u2019t figured out his own feelings yet so TaeJoon was giving him space to do that.

Also this show is giving me nostalgia to my high school pottery class.\n\nHo Tae and Donghee\u2019s relationship is definitely more dramatic (for now), but I find them hilarious together. Something nice with having side couples is you can show a different aspect of relationships. Also like Han Do Woo\u2019s acting.\n\nI think Gongchan is doing a decent job at acting, some good and bad, but I think he\u2019s great at the parts of confusion, and realizing his feelings. The internal struggle was fun to see.\n\nKiss was very dead-fishy but I\u2019m hoping for it to improve since we have like 2 hours left of the show. I loved the hug we saw in the preview.\n\nAlso will once again praise the cinematography and setting. It\u2019s breathtaking. \n\nStill interesting in how the conflict with resolve in 4 episodes but I hope the show keeps a good momentum.",

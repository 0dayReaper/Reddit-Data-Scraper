    "postText": "I had read in previous reviews that this was one of those series that needed more than one viewing to truly understand and appreciate. And let me just say that, after this 2nd rewatch of Strangers from Hell, I could not agree more with that statement.\n\nI had first watched SfH back in (I believe?) 2019, when it first aired. I cannot for the life of me remember what my first watch of SfH was like. What I liked. What I didn\u2019t like. Hell, I couldn\u2019t even remember most of the story or characters. And I guess that was a good thing, in a way, because this 2nd rewatch almost became like watching the series for the first time.\n\nAnd man was it spectacular!\n\nFirst off, the cinematography and film work is fantastic. Eden Residence was so insanely creepy. And it doesn\u2019t look that way quite so much from the outside. But from the inside, it is this dark and damp tunnel that almost feels like you\u2019re inside the belly of some great underwater beast. The building of Eden Residence itself became an actual living, breathing character. And those overhead shots showing characters going to and from the hallway into their own rooms are just so well done. It really makes the place feel so claustrophobic. Almost like this dollhouse, that feels fake and manufactured, but at the same time, like a living thing that is constantly changing. Doors shifting into other places. Halls and rooms changing sizes. Light that never quite reaches every little corner. Especially the fourth floor. It was incredibly unsettling.\n\nSecondly, the acting. I had mostly begun this series when it first aired for Lee Dong-wook, having watched one of his other series before. And needless to say, I was not disappointed with him at all. He moved through the Eden building, sinister and slow. And, if we are keeping to the underwater idea, he was like an eel. Some may say like a shark but sharks, while silent and deadly, are always very out in the open and attack in a very physical, violent manner. Lee Dong-wook was like this watery shadow, creeping along walls and never here, nor there. And while I could sing his praises til the cows come home, I really must talk about Im Si-wan as Yoon Jong-woo. Because he was utterly captivating and I could not for the life of me take my eyes off him, even when Lee Dong-wook and he were sharing a scene. Starting off as just your average, down on his luck kinda guy, Jong-woo seemed very relatable. And after seeing his first encounters with the Eden tenants and the absolute horror that is the Eden bathroom, you really empathized with him. But then came the brief glimpses into Jong-woo\u2019s military background that began to peel up the layers of his character. His internal dialogue began as a sort of casual, careless musings and then took this sharp turn into this disjointed and nightmarish world. His descent into madness was so incredibly well done and I really must commend Im Si-wan for his complete dedication to the character. It never felt one dimensional or that he was holding back for fear of going too dark on his character. It really felt that he was putting his all into this role.\n\nThe two other characters I must mention as well are Lee Kung Eun as our friendly landlady and Park Jong-Hwan playing double roles as the twins. Both were wonderfully played and really stood on their own, right up there with Lee Dong-wook and Im Si-wan. \n\nAnd while I did catch a few things that I hadn\u2019t noticed or realized the first time I had watched this series, I feel that there is still so much that I am missing. So many references or behind the scenes stories and facts about the series and the making of it that would just blow my mind. I have started reading the webtoon but wonder if anyone can suggest any other books/videos/etc that may shed even more light on this delightful little horror story?\n\nMy rating: 4 \u00bd out of 5 stars",

            "comment": "God, I cannot talk enough about this drama, and I literally ranted about it to every single one of my friends who would deign to listen to me lmao.\n\nThere's a lot I could talk about - how good the camera angles were, how amazing everyone did, how it expanded upon the source material (I was actually a translator for the webtoon for a while lol), Kihyuk and how he LASHED OUT at Moonjo and how he was a great character and gave us a lot of insight despite being a red-herring, some tidbits from the script that never made it into the drama (Moonjo's hatred for his mother, his scars, the iconic picture-tearing scene, etc) - but a commonly overlooked part I think is the book Moonjo was reading, aka Jongwoo's \"favorite\". It's \"The Metamorphoses\", by Franz Kafka. You know, the one Moonjo lied about knowing about lmao. he plot has the main character literally turning into a monstrous bug \\[a cockroach, I think? I forget the exact specifics lol\\] and he's rejected by his family and pretty much everyone else when they find out. Similarly, Jongwoo keeps trying to tell people about his problems, and he's rejected by all of them as he slowly is driven further and further into.. well. a monster, I guess lmao. The whole thing about the book, is that even though he's the one who turned into the monster, he's the only one who retains his humanity while everyone else around him treats him cruelly (this was the author's intention I believe, at least). It's basically saying that the people who are alone aren't the alienated ones, it's everyone else living as society dictates. And what did Moonjo keep telling Jongwoo, over and over - that he should do whatever he wants, say whatever he wants, etc. That's literally the theme of the book - that life is meaningless, in a way, and therefore you should do what you want bcs you retain your \"humanity\" so long as you're free from the oppressive \"society\". So clearly this is twisting the original intent of the book, but I wonder if Moonjo wasn't like... understanding it in his own way?? (Bcs he does seem genuinely interested in it, considering he's read over half of it by the time we see him with it and we see him reading it on two other occasions lol) He's literally quoting the main themes of a book he's learned is important to Jongwoo, and that Jongwoo intimately knows about. It's so fucking smart and just another layer of manipulation lol - he knows Jongwoo knows about it, so on a subconscious level if he connects what he's saying with something Jongwoo theoretically should have retained somewhere in his subliminal consciousness, it would stick and mean more. So that was just. Kind of a neat realization haha, how Moonjo changes his manipulation tactics for the person.\n\nEDIT: autocorrect changed Kihyuk to Kihyun...... so close, autocorrect!",

Especially with some of the actors/actresses that play the 'possessed'? I mean, some of them were just pure nightmare fuel.\n\nI wrote a review on it \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/l4vkvh/a\\_welcome\\_guest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/l4vkvh/a_welcome_guest/)",

I think it's because it was produced as part of its network's \"dramatic cinema\" line-up, in which crew and techniques from both cinema and TV backgrounds collaborated to make projects that were a bit different.",

I really do keep noticing things I missed before, particularly foreshadowing. \n\nIf anyone wants to watch it , it left Netflix like a year ago but is now on CJ ENM channel via Apple tv (about $3.50 CAD/mo)",

So I gave it a shot. And it's my forever fave. You mentioned cinematography, but how about OST? Every song and music activated the right kind of emotion in me. I cannot forget the chill going through my body with the Satanic music when Moon Jo is eating meat and the jolt I felt when I realized the dentist's true colors. The main theme song with piano and electric guitar is so beautiful yet heavy and sad... like these two poor souls giving into evil.",

It's not too in your face the way most horror is, with the discordant violins or random screams/screeches. The way the music almost crawls into each scene. It never overwhelms the acting and scenes. It only enhances what is already pretty fantastic.",

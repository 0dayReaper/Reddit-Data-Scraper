I enjoy kdramas that are pre-2020 that focused more on Korean culture and had a tried and true formula that made kdrama romcoms so much fun to watch. When kdramas became super mainstream and changed for international audiences, they've lost some of that kdrama magic for me. Just my humble opinion.",

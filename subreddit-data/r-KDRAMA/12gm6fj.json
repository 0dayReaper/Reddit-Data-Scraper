The unexpected way that their relationship developed instead over the next nine episodes, has just reminded me of how good this drama was.\n\nYoung-joo &amp; Jung Hyun in **Our Blues**: A year since this drama first aired, I'm trying to finish it up at this very moment. I watched Episode 5, where Young-joo's and Jung Hyun's storyline took center stage, around six months ago. Yet it still stands out to me, mainly thanks to Roh Yoon-seo's performance. She's gone on to do stellar work, of course, but her debut in this drama was something special.",

Between that and **Move to Heaven** I was dangerously dehydrated for a good few months.",

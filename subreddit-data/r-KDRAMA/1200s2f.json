I believe that &gt;!the car we saw bursting into flames was on autopilot mode!&lt;, and that Do Gi wasn\u2019t there to begin with! Since he was shown driving while talking to the other members, I think that he was indeed driving but maybe another car. I thought that it would make more sense for him &gt;!not to be in that car from the start than to be there and eject himself or something, especially that the team followed him and didn\u2019t see him!&lt;. Everything happened in a matter of seconds, so &gt;!it would have been easy to spot him had he been in the car (either by the team or by the viewers)!&lt;.

Namkoong Min is such a gem to watch, his cameo was perfect and absolutely hilarious. If it's possible would love to see a special where the two actually team up with each other. It's such a shame one dollar lawyer had some production issues, I really enjoyed the beginning of the series. \n\nThis week's case was quite interesting, but I wish we got more in terms of the revenge to be honest. The part where &gt;! all the security protocols she took before backfired on her !&lt; were great, I would've liked to see it played out more. The ending was.....wow....I'm hoping it means the drama will ramp up after this. The cases have been good this season, but the action has been kinda lacking.\n\nWe've hit the second half of the drama with this week's episodes and as of now I think the second season is okay. By itself, I think it's a fine drama, but in the context of season 1, I don't think it's as compelling or mind-blowing. I think the premise of each case has been good, all of the stories have shown a good message and shines a light on some interesting cases. But the backstory build-up and the subsequent revenge pay-off is not as good as was in season 1. \n\nThe drama has definitely taken on a lighter tone this season and while I do not mind the added humor between the Rainbow Taxi team, I wish it was tempered with the grittiness that season 1 had with it's cases.  Season 1 had lots of action scenes that were a satisfying payoff to the cases. This season skips over alot of it. Most of what we see is the investigation/set-up rather than the revenge itself. It makes the pacing feel a bit slow. I'm surprised they revealed the main villain so early, I'm guessing the second half of the show will revolve around this so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.",

If you look up Ghost Doctors/Ghost Surgeries, you'll see that some surgeons in Korea actually used nurses, assistants and even medical device technicians to perform operations. This was a huge topic which led to the mandate of hospitals having to install video cameras in the OR.",

I also think this is a very realistic way to start a romance - seeing someone being messy when you're in a state of suppressing and numbing similar feelings can be weirdly cathartic and freeing in its own way and I think she is bringing a sense of 'fun' back into his life. It was concerning if he was drawn to her vulnerability/messiness in a predatory/I-can-save-you/taking advantage way but I don't think that's what's going on here, I think he just feels a genuine sense of camaraderie and like he can let loose around her.  \n\n\nETA: the sequence with the music is exactly what waking up after you did something embarrassing actually feels like hahaha. It just pops into your head at random moments while you're doing something perfectly normal and you suddenly want to disappear.",

I think it's the main point where, unlike how the FL believe you should strategies and put your best foot forward for a relationship to work, and even when she did that, her previous relationship ended terribly, and the opposite is going to happen with the ML.",

But yes I feel this has significantly fast-tracked their relationship in the sense they've seen each other's 'bad sides' first and know each other's past relationship failings without any of the sugarcoating/lying that usually happens in early phase dating about exes and breakups. This would normally not be a very good thing since exposing your vulnerabilities to a stranger is risky in relationships but I think in the context of the show they've also established trust early on since neither of them originally want anything from the other but protect their secrets/privacy/dignity anyway.  \n\n\nAlso is &gt;!peeing near someone you have a crush on or know casually really such a strange thing? I feel like it's so common for young people I wouldn't blink at it, other than the literally stepping in it part. !&lt;",

Thankfully, we've now moved past the break-up doldrums and onto a phase of character development where the protagonists grow closer together.   \nThat being said, the subplot involving the little sister and her admirer treads a fine line between romance and stalker behavior. And, let's not even get started on the best friend's husband - their relationship reeks of toxicity! But hey, despite these quirks, the show remains fun to watch!",

I'm glad they at least showed the more mature (and also, female) characters implicitly standing up for this random woman rather than encouraging the guy they know, since so often things like this are depicted as cute and here it was clearly shown to be scary, and non-cute, by the way the female characters responded to it.  \n\n\nI think they even keep making jokes about how stalkerish and creepy he really is with scenes like&gt;! him spooking them when they're talking about ghosts and him literally living in their basement Parasite-style!&lt;. So it's sort of played for laughs because we the viewers understand that he is probably well-intentioned, but it's also pointing out how 'spooky' his behaviour actually is.",

I just hope they maintain the show's overall lighthearted tone and avoid turning it into something darker or more disturbing, similar to the stalker subplot in Touch Your Heart or Mad For Each Other (sidenote: funny how Yoo In-Na seems to attract those kinds of storylines, haha)",

This show seems to be generally aiming to be a bit more lighthearted for one thing, and for another the way they have depicted the stalker character so far is as being fairly benign and well-intentioned. My hope is that he gets a kick in the gut of some kind for his stalkerish behaviour, but it's treated as a learning opportunity for him and he redeems himself.   \n\n\nAs someone else upthread pointed out, there is a parallel in this episode between Bora discussing why her relationship failed (I loved him more, I overfocused on him, and ultimately suffocated him in the relationship) and the way army guy is behaving. I think since Bora is depicted as a 'good' character who did this in a well-intentioned way, army guy will get the same 'chance' to reflect on his behaviour and become better at interacting with women. There's already some hope in that he is asking an older more experienced woman for advice and actually taking her advice, so he's not over the line into overbearingly creepy territory for now.",

She's finding other things to focus on, and hopefully soon enough the dickhead will be out of sight, out of mind. \n\nSang Jin-nim is my favourite affable jerk boss. He's just a petty guy feeling left out by his employees. \n\nFor as much of a jerk they played Su Hyeok to be at the start, he's actually an incredibly chill guy, who seems to have infinite patience for Bora. Their relationship as acquaintances has become so comfortable, where they are even hanging out together at the team dinner. And that comfort clearly comes from the transparency and from the fact that they don't want or expect anything from each other. I am so interested to see how that dynamic translates into a romantic relationship though. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THEM TO GET TOGETHER!",

I'm finding it so lovely to watch a relationship like this which is devoid of the awkward tension, 'needing something from each other', contract/whatever hijinks of so many shows, where the characters simply 'get' each other and aren't trying to get anything FROM each other. I know the tension will escalate in future episodes in various ways but this is a very good place from which to start a relationship, as opposed to Bora's past relationship in which she described herself as loving him more, obsessing, putting him on a pedestal and basically suffocating him. Here they already know each other really well and are a 'breath of fresh air' for each other away from the stress of the rest of their lives.",

I think these moments of just open willing closeness that don't require contrivances and excuses to get them together are really cute, and was obviously missing in Bora's last relationship which was why she felt so insecure with her ex.

ML is legitimately concerned for her worsening her health issue and she seems to know it's a problem too, but admits she's having a hard time getting through the day without the 'help' (which is a very realistic problem but one that also doesn't  usually lead to addiction long-term). I think the show is doing a good job of not being overly moralizing, while also portraying the negative aspects of various unhealthy behaviours realistically (her gastritis, everyone at work showing up late and extremely tired, etc).   \n\n\nIt's cute to the extent that Bora's self-awareness while being a hot mess is 'cute' - she doesn't think she's doing a good job of holding it together, and she is brutally honest about it to the one person she's humiliated herself most in front of - but they even make a point of showing that she was lying to herself about the beer not getting her drunk.",

FL is still superficial af but I still like her for it ...she just embraces the shallow without shame. And we all have a little shallow that we should love. I liked her redo of her breakup. Just perfect. A better human might have let it go and moved on but not Bora! And I love her for it",

            "comment": "So after Bora's misery Olympics in episodes 1-6, 7 and 8 were quite funny. The peeing scene was absolutely hilarious. Bo-ra's character is the messy FL we don't normally see in Kdramas but I've seen more often in western TV (think Fleabag). \n\nHowever, she is not as destructive as Fleabag (though her drinking is certainly questionable). I think the purpose of all of her messy ridiculousness is \"good\" for her: she has got to stop pretending like she is perfect and that romantic relationships are a game to be played. The drama also keeps being meta and referencing how people act in dramas. And it's true: Bora is trying to make her life into the perfect romance we see in movies and TV. But she still hasn't really learned that yet: she references La La Land and then acts out the ending. When will Bora stop acting and just be herself? But Su-Hyeok is falling for the real Bora. He has seen her at her absolute lowest (the peeing scene was hilarious) and yet, he likes her, flaws and all.\n\nI think that's what this drama is trying to say: being sincere and yourself in a relationship and having your significant other accept you for who you are is what a real romance is like. It's about badly rapping in front of a crowd and humiliating yourself because you love somehow that much that you don't care if you embarrass yourself. And it's about waiting outside of a restaurant just so you can be there for the other person when they do something hard. It's about listening to your spouse and knowing what they really need from you (Yu-Jung's husband, I'm talking to you! Pay attention to your wife! Be honest with her!). It's about being your real, true self. Hence the boring English title: True to Love. \n\nSide note: As my husband and I were watching this on the couch last night, we had our airpods in listening (to avoid waking the baby) just like Yu-Jung's husband and the army guy!",

His Ex wanted him to express himself - with no prompting from her - and then called him mean, petty and a coward because he didn't.  she wanted all of the public trappings of a relationship (the rings, the matching shirts, social media - everything that Bora had with HER boyfriend).  But that's not who Soo Hyuk is and it's best that they broke up.  \n\nMy one fear?  Bora might still want all of the public acknowledgement (once they do become a couple) and that the writers will transform Soo Hyuk  into something that he truly is not at his core.  If they have a scene where he suddenly shouts out in a crowded public setting \"I Love You Deborah\", I will downrate the show (and right now it's at a 10\u2b50)",

Everyone doesn\u2019t want to be the one to have the last feeling of feeling like crap. \n\nRegardless it seems that both characters Ive mentioned have finally set in place. But question is with there being 14 episodes and we are on episode 8? What do the writers have in store for us now? What adventures or unexpected turmoil is on the horizon? I mean the latter two arch\u2019s are the CEO/temp and the married couple, unless I\u2019m accidentally missing something.  From next episode\u2019s preview it just looks like the typical misconstrue/push pull right after taking a step forward\n\nThe slow motion walk across the street took me out \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Great stuff like that is what YIN is to be remembered for.",

Strictly coming in from Crash Course in Romance there was a character that seemed nice at first and then turned dark. That is the only reason why I\u2019ve been on the fence with his character. \n\nI had an discussion with someone in last weeks sub post about how I didn\u2019t think he really was a dark intentioned guy but at the same time I could see how he\u2019s actions could be perceived as stalker/creepish. One person swore up and down that 100% of men in the real world are not like our army guy who is happy go lucky with good intentions. It\u2019s silly to say that because you can\u2019t be everywhere at once to know if every guy is unattainable to this \u201cunrealistic portrayal\u201d but at the same time I understand that even though I\u2019m not a woman, that from their perspective it\u2019s hard to tell if someone like him really has good intentions or not, and that usually the first categorization is to place them in the creep/stalker category. You just never know, but at the same time, it is inadvertently and unfortunately is overkill. \n\nI could understand why they said he was a stalker especially about him getting a job close to the bus stop she would take to go home, but that\u2019s really not enough to call him a full blown stalker/creep. He never followed her at night, secretly took photos nor took a piece of her hair to sniff at night smh \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. He just literally manifested his opportunity to make her his girl, with the help along the way of just pure luck, which CAN happen. It is more rare than usual occurrences but it DOES happen.",

We all typically wear masks/don't show our true selves in our workplace/public. I'm glad Bora was able to \"revisit\" the breakup and end it in a way she can reflect back on in a more positive manner. \n\nThough, one thing I hope they address is Bora's drinking problem. I was so frustrated that her sister just watched her take the wine stash and didn't do anything about it! Same for this week when Suhyeok didn't stop her from \"just another soft drink,\" and her doctor clearly told her to stop alcohol. I know it led to a \"comedic\" scene, but not the best message for viewers, and this is coming from someone who loves an after-work glass of wine haha. \n\nYHM is so charming in this role and THAT END.

Prob in my top 5 least favorite tropes but the whole \u201cstalker with a heart of gold\u201d concept is fucking cringe. So many shows go with the persistence in pursuit until you break down there walls and make it endearing but for me it just comes off as a war of attrition that loses chemistry after every scene more and more. \n\n\nI think there is going to be much more to that line in the show since the dude basically mirrors what borah was saying about trying to find the reason for defeat in her initial relationship with her ex (thinking it\u2019s destiny, thinking he\u2019s the only one for her, not being aware of others, making them their whole world) these are all very selfish thoughts if you think about it and not signs of a two way relationship so I\u2019m fine for homeboi to have everything blow up in his face with that preview they show and then have him built back up with realizing the error in his ways,,,,but if they just go with the it\u2019s cute cause he\u2019s got puppy eyes concept to completion then yes it\u2019ll definitely be one of the reasons this show doesn\u2019t get a 10/10 for me.",

They have already showed that other women find his antics somewhat alarming although the reaction of the sister is pretty ambiguous so far.   \n\n\nI would be concerned if the sister was 'won over' by his stalking, but we also know she gave him his number because she liked him/was attracted to him and that he was flattered by the texts so far, so she may end up with him, On the other hand I agree that they 'lose chemistry' with every time he acts overbearing toward her so I'm not sure where they're going with it. I hope you are right that the sister slowly loses attraction because he's being such a weirdo and tells him outright, that would definitely fit thematically with Bora's exbf storyline.",

Most times that doesn\u2019t quite work. This has already been on my mind all along. But physical intimacy just makes it more complicated. \n\nIn real life, so long as they are consenting adults and no one is hurt or strung along too much, fine whatever. Not like everyone you meet is going to be your life partner.\nBut this show is a rom-com and they are setting these two as the OTP, and so I want to buy into it whole heartedly. (And don\u2019t get me wrong, the writers are doing a great job of it albeit some of these concerns of mine). \n\nOn the flip side, in life too, there are always exceptions to anything.

She managed to fully search for houses and move house in between, etc. In ep 8 when she sees Yuri at the mall it's also implied it has 'been a while' with no contact and the contact ended a few days after the breakup so I think it's definitely not supposed to be just a few weeks.  \n\n\nI actually disagree that leaning on each other after breakups 'most of the time doesn't work' (not my experience irl) but then again I am of the opinion that this is actually a stronger basis for a relationship than 90% of kdrama meet-cutes since they are already familiar with each other's character, shortcomings, relationship failings, etc. and seem to have more-or-less unconditionally accepted each other as comrades and friends despite it all. They know far more about each other after this short time than she seemed to know about her exbf after years and understand each other's feelings and attitudes much better.  \n\n\nI guess in my mind literally any relationship you have except the first one you've ever had is a 'rebound' to some degree. You always still have some feelings and hurt about past relationships, and some people are still not over relationships 10yrs later while others are over them in a few days. They are both clearly not entirely over it, but they are slowly getting over it and part of 'getting over' traumatic breakups for people is often meeting a partner who treats you better or is more compatible with you. This is actually my experience of how most people get over toxic exes completely - they only stop thinking and ruminating once they are in a different (hopefully better) relationship. People can and do 'completely' get over relationships without that and move on being happily single but it's quite rare imo.  \n\n\nAnyway I would have been concerned if they were making out a week after their respective breakups because then it would have seemed like 'just' a rebound/getting back at their exes/etc. but there have been plenty of opportunities for that already neither of them took, so this feels organic to me and not just 'quick let me find someone, anyone, to go out with so I can forget about my pain.' That's the thing that's problematic about rebounds after all, is that if someone is 'just' a rebound you're using them like an object, clearly not the case here.",

You remember people, you think about them once in a while, etc etc. You may have lingering feelings of hurt or anger or or happiness or whatever. But there is subtle difference when that still dictates your thoughts and actions, which is the case here. \n\nWhen you have moved on, you don\u2019t actually care much about what the other person thinks of you. \n\nThere is this rom-com movie that treads this same line but they do a good job (whatever they can in the span of a short 1.5 hr movie). \u2018The wedding date\u2019 \u2014 It has been two years from being dumped and the FL is still hung up on her ex and she is trying to \u2018show him\u2019. But there is this scene where you can see she has let go. Her ex comes to her looking worried with something to say. She is listening but out of the corner of her eye, she sees the new guy also coming looking disturbed. Instead of waiting to hear what her ex says which is what she would have done at the beginning of the movie, she stops him and runs to the ML instead asking if everything is okay. She doesn\u2019t care anymore what the other guy thinks of her nor is she trying to be a certain way in front of him. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe problems with immediate emotional rebounds are that you are leaning on whoever you get to fill a void. Btw the same holds true if you don\u2019t have yourself together and expect your partner to make you happy. It is just more acute when you are actively going through a serious breakup. And two months is nothing when someone is blindsided the way Bora was.\n\nAnd as I said, there are always exceptions but this is what I have seen and believe. \n\nAnd I am comparing the drama to real life not other kdramas. That is a testimony to how much I think this show is grounded.",

I don't think she would have done it normally. I also don't think wanting to regain some of your dignity after humiliating yourself is that toxic, it's not like she actually said anything mean to him in the lalaland confrontation so it didn't quite feel like one-upmanship either. But I agree she is not completely over the situation, although at this point it seems she is more concerned with her loss of face and the mistakes that led up to the end of the relationship than pining over him.  \n\n&gt;But there is subtle difference when that still dictates your thoughts and actions, which is the case here.\n\n&gt;When you have moved on, you don\u2019t actually care much about what the other person thinks of you.\n\nHmm I guess it's just a personal experience thing, but I'd say then that 95% of people I know haven't actually moved on from all or even most of their past relationships by your definition. Basically everyone I know still cares what some or all of their exes think of them, still want to 'save face' in front of them, and sometimes still even get emotionally torn up about the breakup even one decade later. If you had to get to this point before starting another relationship, almost no one would ever date.\n\n&gt;She is listening but out of the corner of her eye, she sees the new guy also coming looking disturbed. Instead of waiting to hear what her ex says which is what she would have done at the beginning of the movie, she stops him and runs to the ML instead asking if everything is okay.\n\nI think the show is depicting this already happening between the main leads though. The embarrassment after the street peeing scene where she wakes up the next morning and doesn't even think about her ex, instead she's thinking about su-hyeok and how to avoid him all the time because she's more conscious of what he thinks of her now. In the karaoke scene when she starts having breakup flashbacks they morph into a scene of her hugging su-hyeok. She tells him to think of her before he goes to sleep, and she tells her ex to think of the noodles. She is already 'replacing' the other guy subconsciously in her head at this point, but I think her subconscious mind is moving on faster than her conscious mind. \n\nMy take on 'filling an emotional void' is a little different than yours because this is what people ALWAYS do after a breakup, just sometimes it is with platonic friends and family. Those friendships and family bonds don't feel cheapened by the fact you unloaded your emotional pain onto them for a while, if they are solid relationships anyway. However, if you spent a lot of time talking to your friend JUST to trauma-dump on them, it will likely ruin and cheapen the relationship because you're just using the friend as an emotional toilet and not treating them like a real human being. I think many 'rebound' relationships are bad for the same reason - the person you rebound with 'could be anyone' and you don't have a real bond with them beyond wanting to distract yourself or trauma dump. \n\nThat isn't happening here as they did NOT seek each other out for this reason, were NOT looking at each other as 'distractions' and DID form a genuine relationship from genuine camaraderie, bonding and mutual respect. Moreover they really do see each other as people and like what they see. To me this is a very healthy way to get over a bad relationship - you meet someone who is far better than that person, who makes you feel better, who you get along with better, and realize how crap the previous relationship was. Knowing what it actually feels like to be treated with respect and to feel at ease around someone can be one of the cleanest ways to cut off lingering feelings about toxic, unproductive relationships in the past. And let's be real Bora really SHOULD be moving on from the old guy because he did nothing for her.\n\nI'm not saying you were one of these people but just as an aside I find it funny that last week's thread was full of people being like 'omg she is taking WAY TOO LONG to get over him' and this week it's full of posts like 'omg things are moving so fast!!!' Personally I think she is already 80-90% checked out of the thing with her ex but she just hasn't consciously realized it yet.",

I feel like they're glorifying and rewarding this stalker behavior and equating it to \"persistence\". It's the same thing I have noticed in Single's Inferno 1&amp;2. The \"persistent\" guy eventually gets the girl but it feels like the girls are just settling and giving in because the dudes won't stop. It bothers me a lot because there are already cases of [women getting murdered ](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220915000567) by suitors who wouldn't take no for an answer and that reported stalking incidents has tripled in the last 2 years. Then seeing it being normalized and even glorified is just unsettling.",

Just like last episode I\u2019ve said that it\u2019s a weird borderline thats between being romantically interested in her/stalking. On top of that how the sister reacts to him, is very contrasting and indirect. I like that Bora and her friend told him to stop and let the destiny come to him, but of course, right after that conversation it turns out that the sister by chance is the seller of the item he bought smh lol But army dude, even if you really do mean well, sloooow down \n\nI still feel like they should have written a different storyline with those two characters but we\u2019re stuck with what is being put out each week, so I\u2019m waiting to see how this turns out. And as I thought the over the top couldn\u2019t get any bigger, the preview for next episode blows it out the water. Oh geez.\n\nGoing from acquaintances to practically a serious couple seems the route Bora and ML will be taking and that\u2019s cool. They have basically seen each other at their bottom so in a way that kind of fast tracks them, and the peeing unintentionally subsequently has \u201cmade them closer\u201d but peeing nearby in public by someone you barely know is not normal lol One now lives to tell the tale of how he once stepping in a river by accident in the middle of the city that night\n\nBut wow, Bora drinks A LOT LOL",

                    "comment": "I personally found the backfire of Bora's well meaningly tactful advice hilarious, but I agree that the trajectory of this relationship seems concerning. My hope is that his stalker behaviour will actually sour the sister on him, and he will learn his lesson that relentlessly obsessing over and pursuing a stranger isn't cute or appealing. But the way they portray both of them is still pretty ambiguous, both in the sense that he is presented as otherwise 'harmless' and she is presented as kind of ambivalently into him. They did make several comedic references to him being spooky/scary this ep but due to the tone I'm still not sure.\n\nThe writer's previous work had an (extremely traumatic, jarring, scary) stalking plotline and dealt with the outfall of it heartwrenchingly so I want to believe that this show won't present stalking as OK either, but I am still a little concerned because of how lightly it's been depicted so far. So far he hasn't crossed the line into predator but it's edging a little close. Having been 'well meaningly' stalked by a 'nice' guy before I hope they do this plot justice.\n\nLol at peeing in public near basically-strangers being called abnormal all over this thread and meanwhile I'm like 'everyone in my circles has done this' hahaha  \n\n\nETA: I just had the thought that if army guy goes overboard, there is the potential for the sister to misinterpret their chance encounter by the hotel as him having followed her. The parallel in the same (?) episode would have been when Bora asked ML 'did you follow me here?' when he came to return her phone. If she reinterpreted that or his job nearby as stalking it could lead to a world of pain for him.",

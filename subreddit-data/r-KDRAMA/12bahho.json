But i knew once i got into bl it would be one hell of an experience. So one day while having my lunch I decided to play ODS. Oof. I can\u2019t stop gushing about the leads and their camaraderie. It was so satisfying to watch those two being so comfortable n cute. I particularly loved the part where &gt;!Ian helped Eddy overcome his fear by recreating the same scene and giving it a new ending, thus giving him the reassurance that he is not gonna run away again,!&lt; I actually teared up but the scenes move so fast to the next one I didn\u2019t get to cry my heart out lol. I believe that being seen and being heard is so important in any relationship, otherwise those unresolved emotions pile up and i hate it when couples are shown to patch up just with an intense kiss and no actual problem solving of the bigger issues. They handled it so maturely. Both the actors did amazing. Like i said, it\u2019s a huge feat to pull off all that in such a short amount of time. I hope we get more such quality dramas because for me, quality dramas no matter how short are always superior. Please give it a watch for the wonderful camaraderie \u2764\ufe0f",

I was at a kind of a slump in watching dramas and kept rewatching many of my old favorites, almost like I was afraid to try anything new especially in the more contemporary categories. Maybe **Vincenzo** has given me the push to explore.",

Also the King sometimes killed off a few people, and then regretted. Two questions in one: Was it always like that? \n\nCould the King kill of anyone, since the beginning of Joseon, just for standing in the wrong place? Was it that hard to change who should be crown prince?\n\nI have a vague memory that I might have seem some dramas where they changed the crown prince, but I might be totally wrong on this. After all, they decided on the Heir very early on, before puberty, and people do change. \n\nWas it a case of each generation being holier, so that in the end, the rules became too much? Like, it is seen as a good thing to be loyal to the thrown and praise it at any moment, so someone suggests a rule about never criticising the royalty, to show their own faithfulness, and nobody dare go against it, and suddenly nobody can criticise. Like in Thailand now. \n\nIt is also funny to think about all the sageuk love stories with adult princes, when you know that they married at ten, to make sure that the Queen would be the first mother of his child. \n\nAnd those expeditions with a lot of people: \"I wish he could have had a larger group on that trip.\" And then it says in the notes that the historic notes show that thousand people joined the king. \n\nNo wonder the rest were poor.",

            "comment": "I've been enjoying bingeing shows with shorter episode counts, like **The SOund of Magic** (8 episodes) and just finished **My Holo Love** (12 episodes).\n\nI really enjoyed MHL; the characters were affecting, the villain was sufficiently evil with a plan that makes sense (if you're evil). My brain wanted to compare it to **Unlock My Boss** a little, since there are AI characters featured prominently in both shows, but besides both shows being pretty awesome, they don't have a ton of similarities.\n\nHyun-min Yoon does double duty as both Go Nan-do and the AI Holo. Ko Sung-hee is Han So-yeon, the FL, who gets the stylish pair of HoloGlass eyewear that allows her to see, and develop an emotional relationship with, Holo. The ML gets to be in a love triangle with an AI version of himself! But Holo is Nan-do's personality without the \"flaws\", and Nan-do finds himself falling for So-yeon but doing that dumb thing where dudes are all like \"naw, he's better than me, I'll just make decisions for our relationship without consulting the other person involved\". Frustrating but understandable.\n\nOne of the things I enjoyed the most is how So-yeon *knows* falling in love with an AI is ill-advised and she struggles with it the way some of us struggle with not staying up too late binge-watching kdramas or fighting any other temptation.\n\nIs the technology ridiculous? Absolutely, but that's par for the course. When you're watching a story you really enjoy, effects are incidental.\n\nOMG so many tropes! Umbrellas, piggyback rides, wrist grabs, not only a White Truck of Doom! but a scene with *tens of white trucks!* I wasn't sure where it was going to come from! There's also a mystery and trauma-induced face blindness and sort of amnesia, and of course the lovers knew each other as kids because everyone in Korea knows everyone else as a child.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve with the storyline is how they create tension by having a fight for ownership of Holo that's exacerbated by police intervention. This entire plot line is so far from the reality of how intellectual property works that it was annoying. I want my emotions to be involved in the story, but not in a cheap and unorganic way. I went with it, but it was frustrating.\n\nThe same actor plays both Nan-do and Holo, so I'm not spoiler tagging the fact that Nan-do should have sufficient rights over his own likeness to prevent anyone from ever using his specific image as a mass-marketed AI. Rather than dramatic tension, this twist just makes you wonder where all the lawyers are!\n\nWith that said, the show was great, acting was fire, support characters are played by some of my favorite actors (Choi Yeo-jin and Hwang Chan-sung, for two), and the kissing is not terrible.\n\nI just don't understand why they gave the ML and FL the same shade of lipstick throughout. It was pretty offputting, especially since if they gave an award for best smile, Hyun-min Yoon would be a nominee for sure! He doesn't need that much gloss!",

Works with almond butter and hummus too.\n\nIf the gochujang you have is really thick, you can add a bit of water (I usually use the water from boiling pasta/noodles) to make the mixing easier. I add in the water bit by bit until the sauce is in the consistency I like, don't add a lot at first.\n\nI also usually add a dash of ginger powder and a pinch of sugar to make it taste more flavorful but they're totally optional.",

The gochujang makes a really tasty sauce combined with garlic, ginger, onion, sesame oil, and soy sauce.",

I don't watch historical dramas usually but if it's exceptional then I might give it a try!",

It's a combination of two of kdramaland's favorite themes in the last year (revenge/lawyer) so far, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  As for being a sageuk, it isn't heavily based on the king and the palace, so it is what I would call sageuk-light -- easy to follow. \n\nWoo Do Hwan is doing a great job with the pacing and the balance of comedy and drama. The cast also includes some of the best middle aged male actors in kdrama, and they are more than competent (loving Cho Hee Bong, as always).",

So far I'm really enjoying this even though the villain doesn't make any sense.

A movie that you could describe as being a series of wonderful, even magical experiences. \r  \n5 vignettes, not really connected, very disparate scenes and actions happening, but connected by a character or two you've seen before in a previous vignette.\r  \nYou never really learn much about them in the time they are \r  \non screen, and yet I cared about many of them, cared about their happiness. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, what they were going to do, what would be said, what would be done. I couldn't wait to find out.\r  \nI don't know how the writer managed that, they're very talented, and I will be looking for more of their movies or dramas in the future. Sadly, I've just looked them up and there seems to be only two other projects they previously directed and/or written. I will be trying to find them. \r  \nSide note: There are two songs sung in this movie. Both songs simple and slightly silly due to the youth and naivete of the characters who authored the lyrics, however, the singers have beautiful voices, and the songs are lovely. One song in particular is extremely silly. The lyrics are like a 10 yo writing a love note to his first big crush. But, for reasons I can't say because it would be a spoiler, the backing band and singer pour their heart and soul into playing it, and it becomes beautiful. I clapped at the end like I was sitting in a club watching them live. I couldn't help myself.\r  \nI sit here, having just watched it, and I'm sad. \n\nBecause it's over, and I loved it. I loved it.",

In some ways has the elements of a Greek tragedy..... but not. \n\nLee Seung-gi gives a very good performance as Kangchi. The villain is 'easy to hate'. The FL character is not a shrinking violet that needs constant care. \n\nIt uses a historical figure as grounding, Commander Yi Sunshin.\n\nFor those who like fantasy, history, action, political corruption and slow romance, this has it all.

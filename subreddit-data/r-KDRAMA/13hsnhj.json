Not one but two Insanely gorgeous and popular Korean actors were in it, an amazing second lead couple, brilliant visuals, and Iconic OSTs. there are a lot of things that were positive about it, for me ultimately it comes down to the main couple their chemistry, their character arc, and their development and that's where it falters for me. so The drama is basically a fantasy drama about an ancient warrior who gets betrayed and killed and with some magical intervention he gets revived and reeks vengeance \\[at this point I was very invested I love fantasy\\] but it comes with a cost for the ML he becomes immortal and cannot die until the curse gets lifted so he spent an eternity being a Goblin meanwhile in the present timeline our FL gets born she has a shitty childhood, is poor all that cliche stuff and she gets rescued by the goblin ML and there is some prophecy type thing that the curse can be lifted only by the Goblins so our ML has been searching for the bride and when he meets the FL, he feels a connection. so he watches over her and becomes her protector, etc and FL starts falling for him, he also kinda likes her but keeps a distance but they all type of cute rom-comy things together through out the drama. ok now I'm gonna tell the real issue I've with this and it is that the FL is shown as freaking school girl a high school girl, she is suppose to be 18 but she is still in high schooler, always is introduced to us in school uniform and even though she is 18 her whole characterization is that of a 12 year old, like she acts talks all like one, the cringe was so much for me and the male lead is not a young handsome guy like in his late 20s but he is 40 although very handsome it's more mature dilf handsome and both of them together matches like dad and daughter vibe and this makes the whole interaction weird af, I couldn't connect or enjoy that part of the drama and I tried to watch it but at some point midway I dropped it.",

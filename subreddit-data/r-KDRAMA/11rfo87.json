I was also confused at first because I thought it\u2019s the \u201cunderstanding/meaning\u201d of love. But the Korean word means \u201closs and gain\u201d so they translated it as a similar banking pun: Interest. It seems a silly title in English but when you think about them working in a bank.. The Interest of Love actually makes sense. Probably one of the few English name choices that works and is a good title.",

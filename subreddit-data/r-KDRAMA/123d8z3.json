Also, too much happened in episode 11&amp;12 like the very late reveal that &gt;!Redlin was the mastermind of all this!&lt; like what?? \ud83e\udd74 I wasn\u2019t totally surprised but it was too late for that type of addition to the story. Just too much back and forth with the same characters through out the show.\n\nI enjoyed the funny, silly moments with Rembrary and/or Wild Animal. It was enjoyable but I just feel like the other world didn\u2019t make sense, or needed more explanation or something.  \n\nAll in all, the acting was good and the show had great potential but it lost its spark about halfway through and the last 2 episodes killed it some more. 7.5 for me because of the humor and the fact I did like some parts \n\nIf anyone would like to give me a rundown on &gt;!ms.redrin and her plan!&lt; feel free \ud83d\ude02 I think I got it but also what?? \ud83d\ude2d",

A commenter had asked for my review, so here's what I've got:\n\nQuick synopsis - TV Writer Kim travels to Brussels to trace the progress of North Korean refugee Loh Kiwan, who struggles to survive in a land where he doesn't speak the language or understand the customs. By shadowing Loh, Kim learns to face her own demons.\n\nCho Haejin (trans. Lee Jieun) wrote a remarkable story here, amazing and devastating and hopeful. My heart broke for every single character, and somehow I still felt warm and fuzzy by the end. It's a quick read and really beautifully written, I started it weeks ago, got sidetracked, and then zoomed through the rest in one night.\n\nMy only wish is that it were longer and included more from Kiwan's point of view. All the more reason to watch **My Name Is Loh Kiwan**, which per the title/synopsis seems to offer just that. If Netflix can pull this off, then the film adaptation could be a really great companion to the novel. One thing is for sure - Song Joongki is gonna OWN this role. Even while reading I could picture him perfectly as Loh Kiwan. I would've watched the movie no matter who played the titular role, but now I'm extra hype.\n\n\\[Side note: if you liked **The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo** by Taylor Jenkins Reid, this novel is VERY reminiscent - writer narrator, right-to-die, grief, guilt, the cost of survival, etc.\\]",

In order to keep a consistent appearance of one drama per year, lead actors are required to have their next project picked before their current drama wraps up. And since dramas film for a year but aren\u2019t released until at least 6 months after the final scene is shot, this is nearly 2 years dedicated to a single project. I would like for my favorite actors to enjoy their personal lives and take breaks, but this new scheduling means that if someone takes a few months off, it\u2019ll be that long plus another year tacked on before their next drama is released. This seems taxing and a bit unfair to everyone involved. I\u2019m sure each individual day is filled with less stress than before, but they are also required to dedicate more of their time for less work produced. And it\u2019s hard to stay relevant without overlapping projects. \n\nAre their any recent dramas that have filmed for a shorter length of time? I\u2019d be interested to see what the average time spent really is.",

I understand the obvious answers: lots of post production, better quality, higher budget, improved working conditions, etc. but it all seems a bit excessive, like something is going on in the industry that we aren't aware of.\n\nI'm a big fan of Lee Jong Suk, so I started to notice this with him. Big Mouth was announced April 2021, finished filming April 2022, and released July 2022. He obviously wanted a bit of a break once it was over, but each day that goes by without a confirmed project feels like an emergency when I know it's going to take a year or two for his next drama to be filmed.\n\nPark Bo Gum is another great example. He was released from the military in April 2022, confirmed his involvement in his upcoming drama in February 2023, and it isn't expected to be released until 2024. So fans have to endure military enlistment, and then double the wait while they film a single drama?\n\nThis seems like a pretty massive disturbance in the careers of these actors. In 2019, a drama would be announced, start filming a month later, and begin airing 3 months after that. Now all anyone does is wait. What is going on?",

While Korean industry has grown in popularity you see less of these star projects on television or OTT. The shift seems to towards the Hollywood style of working where actors take their time to decide on projects and then pick big budget shows which obviously take time to shoot and air. Quiet a few are just focusing on movies instead of dramas. \n\nLee Min Ho for example finished shooting for Pachinko season 1 in April 2021 but started filming for Ask The Stars in April 2022. But after that he has been filming continuously first for Ask The Stars and then for Pachinko season 2. If he wasn't committed to Pachinko season 2 he would have probably taken time to start shooting his next. \n\nIn all this I am sharing the same sentiments you do about LJS. LMH will be done with Pachinko season 2 by the first half of the year. After that given that he has a backlog of two projects in 2024 he will again take his own sweet time to decide on his next. Which will come out in only 2025 at the earliest but it could even become 2026.\ud83d\ude22\n\nOnly exceptions seem to be LDW and JCW who are doing many projects.",

LMH may have waited until April 2022 to film Ask The Stars, but that means it's already been a year since they started. If it isn't coming out until 2024, that means production is going to take 2 years? That's absurd! All dramas used to take a few months, even the really good ones. In fact, Twenty-Five, Twenty-One was one of the best dramas of 2022 and they started filming in September 2021 and started airing in February 2022. That's only 5 months total. There is something weird about nearly every drama (whether they require lots of post-production work or not) is taking so much time to release.",

The entire team was new to a space set up so it took longer than they planned. Lee Min Ho wrapped up his parts in February but the FL wrapped up only recently in March. It was originally planned to come out in 2023 but looks like the post production will take more time due to the CGI. \n\nBut I see your point. TKEM also had very good cinematography and good amount of CGI but it came out much sooner. Like they start shooting in October 2019, it started airing in April 2020 and they wrapped up shooting in May 2020. While it finished airing in June 2020. All this with the pandemic breathing down their necks. Overall it seems like Korean industry has changed its working style since Netflix streaming has become a major part. Not to mention stars really taking longer to decide on projects.",

I had so much fun binging through the crazy and the illogical. The visuals of the drama were fantastic and I really enjoyed the OST. The ML and FL had chemistry but their story definitely suffered from the writing. This drama had the stupidest SFL in FL's 'supposed' bestie. Still, the whole drama felt like a fun throwback to illogical makjangs of the past with a bunch of tropes thrown in so I had fun.\n\nI wish doppelg\u00e4nger makjang stories would make a comeback in kdramaland too, miss these ones.",

Why does there always have to be that ex(male or female) that hangs around? Maybe I\u2019m so annoyed because I happen to be watching 2 dramas with that scenario.",

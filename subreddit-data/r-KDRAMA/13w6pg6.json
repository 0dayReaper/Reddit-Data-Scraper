Also it has Park Gyu-young. That's actually a triple win. That's pretty rare. Please be good. Black Knight was mediocre. Netflix, redeem yourself again.\n\nedit: went on wikipedia, and it says 12 episodes, yay! I hope they don't split this into a 6/6 like Money Heist. Big mistake with The Glory, to be honest. Ruins the momentum. Netflix needs to realize that people will always find a way to pay less than they have to. Now they just have to wait a little bit longer if they want to save money. That's it.",

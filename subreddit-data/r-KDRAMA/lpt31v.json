I haven\u2019t watched Lovestruck in the City, but from what I\u2019ve gathered is that it\u2019s pretty romance heavy, which isn\u2019t really the vibe Hello? It\u2019s Me! is currently giving. Hello? It\u2019s Me! seems to be more focused on self rediscovery and character growth, rather than romantic relationship heavy.",

But from what I remember he hurt his back doing stunts in Healer that was why he stayed away from this action dramas. \n\nBut tbh, I really like him romcoms, he is so dreamy when you know he is in love with the female lead. He just needs better script and female lead with good chemistry like he had with Park Minyoung.",

I loved him more as Prosecutor Noh, though.   \n\n\nI like Lovestruck in the City too. as much as it is dragging, I still finished it because of the unbelievable chemistry between Wookie and JiWon. My goodness, that one's over the top!",

It was so smartly written, funny and so romantic it made me want to watch everything Ji Chang Wook was in, including Healer. But the show was a Netflix-produced show, so I assume it was written to draw in a global audience so it is a bit more Westernized than shows like Healer. That may not appeal to everyone. Same with Sound of Magic. Those shows didn\u2019t hurt him as it gained him at least one more fan who scoured the streaming services for his previous shows. Healer was great; Suspicious Partners was cute; The K2 and others are on my watchlist. The variety of shows is a testament to how well he\u2019s done. I can\u2019t wait to see what type of shows he ends up doing next \ud83d\ude42",

I remember K2 was popular but not well liked, although that was because of the plot and other actors rather than JCW himself. \n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily that people only want him in action roles. I remember people were really excited when he was cast in Suspicious Partner since it was a romcom, although that drama fell off towards the end.\n\nI know that IYWUM was well-liked, I think Magic was relatively well liked, but all of his other dramas were mixed on both a popularity and critical level, if not outright disliked (Backstreet Rookie, Melting Me Softly).",

The only thing I ever saw him in was The K2 and minus his relationship with the kidnapped girl (I thought the childish/lovey dovey scenes were over the top and really not fitting with the theme of the show tbh) - his acting was on point. And I may be in the minority in thinking that his character actually had more chemistry with the Mrs/Boss lady- because there was so much tension between the two when they\u2019re together even when there was not much said. I thought that relationship was much more interesting to watch then the relationship with his love interest.\n\nBut he shouldered (quite literally sometimes) every scene he was in. Intriguing actor to watch. Since I haven\u2019t seen him in anything else I don\u2019t know if it was just a combination of good writing coupled with good directing and finished off with good acting but The K2 is one of my favorite Kdrama.",

Maybe someone can inform me, but it seems like he's missing a role like Kim Jae Wook's character in *Voice*, or something similar to Ok Taec Yeon in *Vincenzo*. Roles where he stretches the character would be a refreshing change. I'd like it if he'd pair up with someone who is equal to him in star power because it seems like he's usually the main draw.",

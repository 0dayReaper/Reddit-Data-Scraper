It is unlike any other korean drama Ive watched.   \nI was a little sceptical when people said its a Korean version of GOT because I didnt think a Kdrama would be able to pull of fantasy like GOT but damn they did and I would like to add that it is nothing like GOT. Not even close. That is not to say GOT is better. These are both totally different dramas.   \nI cant WAIT for Season 2 although I am a bit sad about the main leads changing but I love LJK so its chill.",

I couldn't believe that Thailand could make a better show than Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan but was I surprised! I had dropped the Korean Boys Over Flowers after 2 episodes but this one had me in its grip from the beginning. Started yesterday and have already binge watched 5 episodes.\n\nEverything about this one is superior. The story as well as the characters are much better written. For eg. the FL isn't fearless like in the Korean version. On the contrary she is fearful of the power of F4 and keeps her head down for months while she sees them bullying other students. But when someone close to her is targeted, she finds the strength to rebel. She isn't kickass, but displays a quiet inner strength and that's why it's easy to believe when the ML and SML fall for her..\n\nAlso, the actor who plays Ren (SML) has one of the most ethereal faces I have ever seen. What a beautiful beautiful man! \u2764",

No one seems interested in exactly *how* or *why* the FL goes through a supernatural transformation every month. It's just a device to show that the ML still cares about her, even when she looks like someone else. (For some value of \"cares\". I know Koreans love the whole cold, stoic ML thing, but Lee Min-ki takes it to the point of being downright robotic; he isn't a good enough actor to sell the hidden emotional side of the character.) The show also piles on a lot of cliches, like the bitchy younger rival of the FL, the long-suffering best friend/manager, the smartass secretary, etc. The worst was the &gt;!kiss that both leads try to pretend \"didn't mean anything\".!&lt;\n\nIt's interesting how kdramas seem to have evolved past a lot of these stale tropes in the last few years, and how \"old\" a drama from 2018 can feel.",

And it is interesting that what men and women believe the other prefer is not exactly how it is. Hormones are also very visible on our face, and infections and malnutrition we had growing up. \n\nWhen that is said, it is also true that friendship can trump looks and when you are in a relationship, you start to care less. \n\nThere are lots about looks: **Gangnam ID** that I haven't seen. [**Oh my Venus**](https://mydramalist.com/15062-oh-my-venus) that was fun, but might be not that great carried out. [**The Birth of a Beauty**](https://mydramalist.com/11177-birth-of-a-beauty) was the one with this as main subject that I liked the most, of those I have seen. Lots of fun. More realistic ideology. \n\nTwo old ones are about beauty contests: **Miss Korea** and **City Hall**. They are both slightly critical, but without really coming out with any deep, new understandings. City Hall is funniest. More about politics. Miss Korea was a bit repetitive. Its age is showing.",

I think they left enough seeds for a possible second season. \n\nHonestly, I really don't like that practice. One of the things I love about K-dramas is that the stories *finish*, they end. They aren't dragged on and on through multiple seasons like American shows, where by season 4 the writers are out of ideas and it just fizzles out. \n\nI like a good satisfying story where everything ties together, and I hope that K-dramas will stay true to that style of story telling.",

Their whole \"relationship\" was about his needs. Her job was never really the problem. (She was in fact exceptional at it and enjoyed it.) The problem was that she was being taken for granted. Over the course of the drama, he starts to really see her. For example, he goes from perfunctory romantic gestures that are really meaningless to her, to genuinely connecting with her as a person. In fact, near the end of her two-weeks notice, he says to her something like, \"I see now that all the business success that I thought was mine alone was actually due to the success of our partnership.\" At the beginning, she was an effective and powerful person both professionally and personally, but he didn't know that. Now he knows and values it. She needed to find a place where her needs and wishes were equally valued. Now she has. They have built something together, both personally and professionally, so she chooses to stay!&lt;.",

But I managed to squeeze in **Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area** this week and it did not disappoint. \n\nI only watched a few episodes of the original Spanish series before I realised it would be too long for me to follow for multiple seasons. That's why I was glad for the Korean remake, since it would be much shorter and would get to the end faster. \n\nThe drama was unexpectedly.. wholesome somehow? Yes, it was brutal and full of action. I also didn't enjoy the first person perspective when they did the rescue mission. But I loved the chemistry between the characters (esp the robbers) and started to wish some of the hostages would get shot instead lol. \n\nI didn't check the cast list before I started watching and was pleasantly surprised to see *Yuna-yaaa*~~ in the series. She was so good playing the bratty kid somehow. The cutie U-Ju from **Hospital Playlist** also made his appearance and made me squeal with delight. \n\nAlso, damn, the \"real son\" (Kim Ji Hoon/Denver) needs to be made into a statue! His body was already sculpted and ready to go there. \n\nNot sure if it was the colour grading/filter or makeup or lighting effect, but I didn't like Park Hae Soo/Berlin's orange fake tan look in there. \n\nOverall, good heist drama, gripping and full of action with a somewhat happy end. I enjoyed it.",

Some of the same features - a backstory set during a historical period, people who end up living hundreds of years with powers (only here it's 2 &amp; 3 FLs), and a bit of amnesia thrown in. But it felt more makjang with scheming CEOs who will stop at nothing.\n\n\nI started it for the PPL challenge for Jewelry and, Wow! It delivered.Have never seen so much and varied jewelry pieces in one drama. The fashion was also pretty amazing. \n\n\nSome quirky things that made it fun in places: two spots where a character does a modern dance as an expression of the mood. Subway sandwiches in a drama where most of the food was rather elegant. FL played Boon Yi in Six Flying Dragons and here her sageuk character has the same name and look.\n\nThere are a couple of OSTs that were very familiar. Probably were in my first KDrama playlist.\n\nIt was 20 episodes long (which usually feels long to me these days) but there was so much going on and I was curious what would happen next, so that kept me going.",

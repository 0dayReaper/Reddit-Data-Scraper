It's just really good. \n\nSi Wan and Se Kyung play such a cute couple. They have great chemistry, and the couple's attraction is very obvious and seems very natural. Soo Young's and Tae Oh's characters are fun and I'm interested how they'll develop.\n\nThe characters as a whole are fantastic. A bit whacky, but very realistic. In general I love the slice-of-life feeling of the drama. It's just people living their life trying to do their best. And I love that. And people communicate. Nice.\n\nThe colours are so vibrant and gorgeous, it looks just fantastic. And I like the editing of scene changes. How the same movement or body positioning is used by the different characters in the scenes, making it a very fluid and quick transition, fitting the vibrant colours and snappy dialogue.\n\n\n\n^((And can I just say that Yim Si Wan looks exceptionally pretty in this drama?))",

One of the most realistic dramas I've seen without trying to be too \"artsy\" or \"cute\" or \"philosophical\". Just real people living imperfect lives. Plus there is a deaf actress and an actress with down syndrome. Everyone did a fantastic job and there are some very well known veteran actors and actresses as well. \n\nI haven't seen that many people recommend this drama, I think they should. I enjoyed it far more than HCCC, Our Beloved Summer, and My Liberation Notes, which have various similarities.",

Few scenes felt like the final 5 minutes of the show but then it just kept on going and going and going.. I don't think I could've watched this without multitasking.\n\nAm I trash for wishing the 2nd ML switched roles with the main actor? He was so charming. Not to say the ML didn't act his ass off. I just liked the other guy more. Also Ms. Dentist's green dress is Episode 13 was ugly. Looking like Santa's boujee little helper. Her other outfits were great.\n\nNetflix didn't save my progress for **Our Beloved Summer** so I have to start over again. I don't really remember much so its fine. The lighting is kinda weird in this show. Whenever there's a scene with white or they're outside, it just blurs like there's smoke in the room.\n\nI feel like my day is going to end with me sounding like a dark little cloud but I guess that means its time for gelato and cookies.",

ML continues to make it worth watching. He\u2019s the only character who seems multi-dimensional, and I\u2019m not sure how much is the writing and how much is his acting. Even though he trends into makjang at times, I think that\u2019s the director, because they all do. I thought his performance in Shooting Stars was uneven, but appealing. In FM, he\u2019s carrying the whole show, but he\u2019s capable of it.",

After **Love To Hate You**, this was the second romance drama I've seen this year that I truly liked. \n\nI mentioned on the FFA thread yesterday that I was surprised it's got some good wisdom in it. There were 4 couples in the drama and the chemistry were there (except for Sangjin and his partner, which I wasn't too thrilled about). The common theme was the lack of communication, and the drama addressed each of them according to their own situations pretty well. Had some real laugh out loud moments as well, which has been rare in my recent Kdrama watch. \n\nOverall, this will be one of the few dramas I'd rewatch when I'm feeling down. Very uplifting and has got some good message/reminder to get you back up. Highly recommend!",

He's also playing two very different characters, both of which he gives their own distinct characteristics.\n\nI think my favorite part is a scene in the 2nd episode where he has to cry. It struck me as so authentic to the moment and the character. There's so much subtlty in his craft, chef's kiss.\n\nI know he's a **serious actor** but I wish he did more fun roles like this and **Finding Mr. Destiny**. He seems to be enjoying himself so much, I love the way it comes through on the screen.\n\nOh, and there's still plenty of time to thirst over him. The man's abs are constantly on display!",

I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a 2018 drama, because it\u2019s such a throwback in terms of having lots of love triangle tropeyness, plus silly behavior from the characters. Also, even though it is 100% a romantic comedy, it also has random occurrences \u2014 one character actress playing two roles, and (trigger warning): &gt;!nonconsensual tattooing!&lt;. And then there\u2019s the makjang.\n\nI started it because I love watching Junho\u2019s default low-key smoldering. But I really got into Jang Hyuk\u2019s acting! This is the first time I\u2019ve watched one of his dramas, and I\u2019m delighted that I have many more in store. \n\nWondering if anyone has recommendations for Jang Hyuk\u2019s  best romantic dramas?",

In-Ho is really pathetic. Even in the moment where he\u2019s asked what he wants to do, he\u2019s taking forever to give an answer. Doctor Cha doesn\u2019t deserve that on top of the affair itself. I can\u2019t even tell if he actually wants to be with Doctor Cha because of who she is or what she does for him and their family and his image. Maybe a mix of both by the end of it but too little too late. I don\u2019t even remember him saying he loved her as a reasoning yet \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nIn the same breath, Seung-Hi is also sad to watch. Doctor Cha and In-Ho were definitely in the wrong for what happened during medical school. However, SH and IH coming together to have a love child and then start their relationship up again when she came to Korea is crazy and out of line. And for her to think doctor Cha owes her anything 20+ years later is also insane. She needs to take her daughter\u2019s advice and move on from the situation. In-Ho is garbage anyways \ud83d\ude2d at this point she more wants something to show for the damage caused in her life by their relationship. \n\nI really like she son! And I have to commend ML for the comedy he brings \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s made me laugh so much!!! Anyways, I would say I\u2019m enjoying this show \ud83d\ude0a",

She was the main obstacle of their relationship at the time, she gets killed off, they mourn her for like half an episode and then moved on quite happily. And the ending was so abrupt and depressing.

With the success of TKEM largely carried by it\u2019s international popularity, we should do better to be more open minded towards those of other cultures who loved TKEM regardless of the difference that they see in our Korean culture. \n\nBlueCatSW9 is obviously not a troll.

It was a bit too dramatic for me though, too much childish behaviours, haha. I've seen Boys over Flowers around on Netflix but I haven't gotten around to watching it. I don't really like watching anything older than 2016, but now that I know LMH is in it I might try it out. As for WDH, saw him first in Tempted and was pleasantly surprised to see him again in TK:EM.",

And his character was just so awful in it. The Heirs is OK but it looks quite dated too. \n\n The only drama that helped me with LMH fix has been LOTBS so far... I recommend maybe some of his other movies? If you see something that is good let me know too....",

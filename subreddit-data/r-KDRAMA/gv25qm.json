Just like the plot within the show,  Jo-Jung-suk is a big matchmaker to make my friends love this show.\n\nAnd yes, its a good show for male viewers cause there's organic/un-cringey lovelines with humorous friendship anecdotes, kinda like watching Scrubs or Brooklyn Nine-Nine.",

To my surprise there's a lot of great shows that feel more geared towards male audience (rugal, vagabond that I've watched) and even hospital playlist is a super solid show everyone would like. \n\nI also heavily recommend prison playbook as my #1 to anyone and everyone!",

Pretty great ensemble as well \u2014 I immediately fell in love with Park Hye-su since the first episode! Lol. I'd really recommend it if y'all haven't watched this gem!",

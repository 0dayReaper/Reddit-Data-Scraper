This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I remember that other teachers kept mentioning her and the girl was quite bitter becuase she's not as clever. I also remember thr girl revising alot and her parents still saying she doesn't put as much effort as her older sister. The girl and her friends also revise at a study cafe place at night and I remember a scene where they revised late and her friends go home but she doesn;t once realises there's still loads of ppl still revising and stays. This was all the first episode since I didn't get very far.\r  \n\r  \nI remember the synopsis mentioning that (I think) the top student in their class goes missing or smth and they try find or smth along the lines.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis is all I remember.

He\u2019s a single dad with a young son. The grandfather is working security at the apartment complex. \n\nShe is a strong/aggressive FL and he\u2019s a bit more timid. Iirc the romance is pretty lite so the story is more focused on the business stuff and on the MLs life. The drama def feels more aimed at his POV than hers. \n\nThanks",

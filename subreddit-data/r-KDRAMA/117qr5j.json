However if you *don\u2019t* normally like romance, you just might like this anyway! It addresses misogyny and sexism head-on, with a brave and competent heroine who relishes a good fight. The skinship is (eventually) more natural and joyful than we usually see in Kdramas. Also Yoo Teo as the male lead and Kim Ji-hoon as his trusted friend are a revelation \u2014 I think this is the first romcom for both of them and they nailed it, both the romantic scenes and their adorable bromance were laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, there\u2019s even a (sort of) kiss between them! \n\n**Bad Things** It was only ten episodes... although maybe that\u2019s a good thing too because it kept everything moving at a quick pace.\n\n**Interesting Things** I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes of filming the action noir movie from the point of view of the actors and stuntmen (and women). \n\n**Verdict** For romcom fans this is a 100% must-watch, I haven\u2019t had this much fun since **Business Proposal** last year!",

It doesn't play with your expectations and focuses on entertainment as promoted. It keeps getting better! \n\n**Bad things:** characters may seem off at the beginning but they really grow on you. Cases are simple and predictable but strong plot has never been a focus in this drama, so better ignore that. The props and setting scream low budget but they fit the light vibe of the drama so well that find myself not complaining but snort laughing. \n\n**Interesting things:** episodic crime cases deal with brain and lightly describes different interesting and real psychological effects like face recognition disorder, memory reset, etc. It was interesting to google after each episode. \n\n**Verdict: YES** if you need a refresher, mind you it is neither truly a crime drama nor a romcom and humor is very silly, dad joke like. \n\n\n\n###2. Kokdu \n\n\n\nPromising plot but messy execution. The story is all over the place and full of forced plot conveniences. I am enjoying only the scenes involving FL, ML (esp kokdu) and the grim reapers. FL isn't bad as people keep saying. Kim Jung hyun is hard carrying it, he is playing three different characters very smoothly and his comedic timing is perfect. \n\n**Verdict: YES**  if you love kjh for his acting and have the energy to interpret the interesting but messy plot.\n\n\n\n###3. Crash course in romance\n\n\n\n**Verdict:** I guess everyone is watching it lol. If you aren't, a gentle heads up, the drama picks up from ep3. **YES!**",

A hallmark drama known for the 'green eyes' of revenge that marked one of kdrama's earliest and most memorable CGI effects. Legendary Shim Eun Ha in action (I get her fame now).\n\n*Bad Things:* The very preachy message about abortion and ridiculous science fiction to back up the message. Awkward English dialogue! And by today's standards: bad CGI and special effects makeup.\n\n*Interesting Things:* The love polygon going on in this drama was pretty impressive, especially considering that amnesia and murder was part of it.\n\n*Verdict:* At 10 eps (~45 min episodes), the story developed nicely and was fairly compelling once I got over the preachy message about abortion. I'd recommend it to see how it treated certain issues in the context of those times.\n\nIt's available on YT on MBC's channel for old dramas split up into individual playlists for each episode *and* there are no Eng subs. I personally found it understandable without subs but if you don't know Korean beyond a few phrases, you'll probably struggle. Playlist for [Ep 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOBbhydezQbfE03sWtg0qo5_7IJ4_svfz), the rest should come up in suggestions.",

            "comment": "**The Interest of Love**\n\n* **Good Things**: I haven't seen a drama quite like it. The nature of the relationships between the main characters swing wildly from episode to episode, and sometimes defy expectations. It has some beautiful slice-of-life moments. Keum Sae-rok and Moon Tae-yu emerged with their acting reputations enhanced.\n* **Bad Things**: In Episode 8, the drama was reveling in the awkwardness and second-hand embarrassment of the characters' interactions. In Episode 12, the tone of the drama became so heavy I questioned whether I would be able to complete if it continued in that tone.\n* **Interesting Things**: The first two episodes gave some interesting insights into the day-to-day operations of the bank.\n* **Verdict**: For better or for worse, this drama takes you on a roller coaster ride. Some people will choose to get off the ride before its final destination. Others will ride the ups and downs, sometimes with elation and at other times through gritted teeth, until the bittersweet end.\n\n**Trolley**\n\n* **Good Things**: The first eight episodes delivered everything one could ask for from a mature, slow-burn thriller. In terms of performances, each character had their turn to shine throughout the series. The final episode delivered a strong finish. \n* **Bad Things**: Once the revelations started unfolding in the second half of the series, they became increasingly convoluted, to the point where the series had shifted a long way from the strengths that marked the first half of the series.\n* **Interesting Things**: For a philosophy graduate, seeing the trolley problem referenced in a drama was beyond awesome.\n* **Verdict**: It will have to go down as a disappointment overall, given the high standards the series had set in the first half.",

Also, I really appreciated the stellar acting by Lee Sang-Woo, Lee Sung-Jae, Jung Yoo-Min, Yoon Joo-sang and of course, Seo Ji-hye (who has perfected the art of acting the impeccably dressed victim.)\n\n* **Bad Things**\n\nAfter you get sucked into the storylines, you will begin to feel that the series is essentially a derivative of Parasite.  In addition, it made me scream at the TV and become sick to my stomach (due to the behavior of certain characters.)\n\n* **Interesting Things**\n\nLee Sang-Woo,\u2026 I learned that his smiles are sooo Swooooooon-worthy.   \n\n* **The Verdict**\n\n**Pass**.  Unless cheating, Lying, Stealing, Jealously and stupidity are your thing.",

It was his time to shine. for us to know that he really carries Doldam on his shoulder despite his hesitations most times. that he really is cool! \n\nI loved how Woo-Jin spoke for himself - &gt;!despite understanding Kim Sabu and everything. He gets to decide with whom he wishes to stick. and that's Kim Sabu.!&lt; I love this Father-Son duo too much \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI genuinely do not think Dr. Senior arrogant and childish Cha can start anew ever- not with his performance surgery not with his sweet tactic. Nope nah not at all. \n\nI'm also firmly believing that Kim Sabu &gt;!wants someone else to control the functioning of the hospital so that other doctors are more than just doctors and have a personal life. but I think each Doldam staff his like that regardless of who is in control they would still all be Dr. Romantics for their patients. !&lt;\n\nAlso telling Eun-jae your very daughter that her pride doesn't matters - yup so wrong papa Cha. please be a father and try to see and understand the journey your daughter has covered as a doctor uphill now. \n\nAlso Dr. Seo Woo-Jin really is going everything to be a doctor if previews are to &gt;!be believed than this will be his second encounter with weapon \ud83e\udee2!&lt;\n\nalso Dr. Dond (Jang) he gets even more annoying every episode - Waah! also Nurse Eom and I had the same emotions when &gt;!Eun-Tak said I'm her boyfriend! Loved it!!&lt;\n\nExcited for next week now\ud83e\udd29",

Maybe I'm reading too much into his situation, but the way things are moving along, I'm not liking it one bit.\n\nIt's as if his role is almost coming to an end and we won't see more of him.",

Working in small hospitals like Doldam might be something that Kim sabu has been doing for a while, and because the scale is small, he probably didn\u2019t see the work-life balance problems that his doctors were having. The trauma center is his dream, but operating a big trauma center is something that he hasn\u2019t done before, so someone with experience like Dr. Cha is a great help. Their ideology is different. Kim sabu is all about romanticism, but Dr. Cha is all about disciplines and reality. This season opens a realistic lens of how big hospitals work, and I love how Kim sabu is a little shaken now. It shows that he\u2019s not a saint, he\u2019s just a human like somebody else and sometimes he has to sacrifice something to make best ends for everybody. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an end of his era. It\u2019s more like a new era when he understands himself more and adjusts his belief for the best sake of everyone who loves him. His ideology still stands, but it needs some work to do to be efficient in a more realistic world.",

You've no right to treat Eun-tak like that when you're the incompetent one.\n* Aww, I love how Cha Eun-jae is treating Dr. Lee \ud83d\udc95\n* I understand why Cha Eun-jae is hesitant to tell her dad about Seo Woo-jin. After all, South Korea is still conservative. I hope she finds the courage to do so.\n* I'm happy that Cha Eun-jae and Seo Woo-jin communicate their feelings with each other!\n* I can't believe I'm saying this, but for the first time, I like Dr. Cha Jin-man. I like that he's defending his team. I still believe he was rather harsh on the mother though, as if she hadn't just lost her son... I agree with Ms. Oh.\n* I'm glad that Kim Sabu is keeping an eye on Dr. Jang.\n* \"Don't you know that she's a clumsy kid? She's just tall.\" I love this line so much \ud83d\ude02\n* Wow, I like Dr. Cha Jin-man 25% better after today's episode. I'm glad that he apologized to Seo Woo-jin.\n* Oh well, never mind.

She is being respectful and very supportive - calmly helping the person who wants to become a good doctor.\n\nUnlike - \n\nDr. Jang - &gt;!OH MY GOD! I SERIOUSLY HATE HIM!! The audacity this man has! You literally suck at your job at this point and you have the face to go lecture Eun-Tak about who's the doctor and who's the nurse! Oh Boy that Nurse could treat a patient far better than you- You dumbo! I'm so glad Kim Sabu is on his neck about this! !&lt;\n\nI really like how they are subtly showing how great of a doctor Yoon Ah-Reum is becoming. I love it - and that announcement of Death Time scene was really so well done. applause applause. \n\nSo Dr. Seo Woo-Jin is the certified &gt;!next Dr. Kim of the hospital with various specialities and the swiftness, fast yet precise stable hands during surgeries. Not only that he has the romance towards  his patients because he isn't just a GS but a Doctor first.  !&lt;\n\nDr. CS resident (sorry I still don't remember his name\ud83d\ude2d) I love him - he is clumsy and has his own short comings but he is &gt;!eager to learn and wants to put in the hardwork to learn and become a good doctor. Because if it wasn't for him Dr. Jang wouldn't have suggested the practical learning. Oh also he got teared eyed listening to how supportive Eun-Jae was - aewww I wanted to hug him so badly.!&lt; \n\nAlso Also It felt weird watching Nurse Oh i&gt;!n different uniform and that little moment when she was trying to remember where all the rooms are - !&lt;aww cute. \n\n&gt;!Dr. Jung was so vulnerable and guilty - he needed to apologise, to acknowledge and to have the other doctors understand his pain - I'm pretty sure he didn't need the Stand Straight. He needed to just cry which Director Park and Kim Sabu gave him. !&lt;\n\nNOW TO &gt;!\"I have to possess everything you have achieved, Bo-Young-Ju\" !&lt;\n\nLiterally WTF!! \n\n&gt;!Firstly, I'm glad that whole monologue of protecting the hospital wasn't seen as the cool moment that it started with I'm glad Nurse Oh was there to remind that the person right there was grieving mother who just lost her son and throwing those facts and questions in her face in that very moment was not Cool. That was the moment to apologise not to walk out and act so stoney. He wasn't there for the patient nor was he there for his doctor who was clearly guilt ridden, emotional and vulnerable. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!And what is this childish want of jealousy? I want whatever Kim Sabu has - WT actual F! You started this very journey by insulting and looking down upon everyone in the hospital, for you everyone is a minion. You wouldn't waste your breathe on Dr. Jang (he isn't worthy either tbh) or on Dr. CS resident and try to mould them into better doctors. You want a finished product and that's exactly why you want have what Dr. Kim Sabu has achieved and nor the Doldam people will stick with you. They are there because of the patients and because Dr. Kim asked them too. So seriously grow up - this entire stance of yours is nothing but absolutely annoying childish and as well as lacks EQ! !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Dr. Seo is only being that good to you because Kim Sabu taught him how its not about the doctor but his patients and 2ndly You are his gf's father- That's it!!!&lt;\n\nThe preview - since Dr. Romantics preview are nothing but a big lie so let's see how tomorrow turns out to be. \n\nAlso I really think that Kim Sabu i&gt;!s planning to retire or at least be more in the background that's why he is testing everyone and their team playing capabilities and well training the new residents better so that Woo-Jin, Eun-Jae, Ah-Reum, Insu and Moon have best team with them. !&lt;",

He has a point doctor put too much risk on a risky operation and will be too much weight on doctor responsibility. If he totally villain char, poor woojin has to deal with worst father and mother in law after having shitty parents in his childhood. \n\nI actually hate the actor and hope thet cast different actor for for Cha Jiman roles because regardless of his personal life, he is just average actor.  but what should I do?

My favorite person to be mad at, here I was expecting some improvement but he\u2019s still causing trouble. &gt;!If he was just competent enough, Dr. Jung wouldn\u2019t forget about the kid, I\u2019m so worried about him huhu!&lt;\n\n\u2014\n\n**EPISODE 6:**\n\nI\u2019m still worried about Dr. Jung but I gotta admit &gt;!having Byeol around was super cute and it was nice seeing more of his back story. Not to mention the short, but adorable dynamics Byeol had with her Woojin oppa, THAT WAS SO CUTE I AM SO SOFT FOR HER!&lt;\n\nThe title of this episode really emphasized the difference between Dr. Cha and Dr. Kim. Their rivalry is getting interesting now that &gt;!Dr. Kim seems like he\u2019s second-guessing his ways!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jang Donghwa, once again, being put into his place. What a delight!

While he shouldn't have walked out of the Trauma Center, I was glad he did because the Doldam Team is understaffed, and being able to voice criticism and receive respect is incredibly important in any work environment. Even if Woojin had been present, the same team would've been available outside of the OR. In my opinion, I think the team was understaffed and underprepared -- even for a \"trial\". \n\nThe situation itself is unfortunate because the doctors aren't accustomed or familiar with the layout. Even the Head Nurse wasn't sure where the observation room was. Personally, I was a bit angry that the nurses didn't follow up, or at least check in on the patient.",

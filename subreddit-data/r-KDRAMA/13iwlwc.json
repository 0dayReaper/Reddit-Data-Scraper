    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs).

Kind of like how netflix did with \"Love to Hate you\", if the Korean networks grow less interested in providing rom coms.",

In \"**Mal\u00e8na**\", an Italian movie by Giuseppe Tornatore starring the beautiful **Monica Bellucci.** I remember watching this movie with my dad many many years ago:\n\n(Link: [https://preview.redd.it/1nljn7wra30b1.gif?format=mp4&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=310a1e1c0a2fa8051f6d1f461ff17a0a7d4a7246](https://preview.redd.it/1nljn7wra30b1.gif?format=mp4&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=310a1e1c0a2fa8051f6d1f461ff17a0a7d4a7246)).\n\nNow, I have no idea if there is any correlation between the two scenes, but their resemblance really struck me.\n\nSeeing that **The Devil Judge** seems to have been inspired by different other productions (think *Hannibal*, *Beauty &amp; the Beast*, *Bluebeard*, etc.), this could either be a coincidence (the \"powerful woman trope\") or it could've been inspired by it.\n\n**Lana Del Rey** did the same and I thought that photoshoot, too, was inspired by Tornatore's movie, but then I thought that the *femme fatale* trope has been prominent since film noir Hollywood productions from the '40s. \n\nI'm not sure how much Korean directors are acquainted with Italian cinema, but despite the fact that the trope is not that uncommon, as an Italian I was quite surprised at how uncanny the similarity between the two scenes was!! &lt;3\n\nAny thoughts? Do you know any other similar scenes happening in other Kdramas?",

These two shows have seen great reception and success in both local and international audiences.\n\nBeing curious, I researched about these actors' filmography/series/projects, and discovered that these actors are more well-known in serious types of characters and genres. They also rarely do romance or romcoms and their projects revolve more on melodrama or action genres. I was surprised on how well they do in romcoms/romance even if this genre was not what they are known or famous for.\n\nI was personally thinking that part of the reason why they are successful in these kinds of genres is due to the rarity of times they appear in these kinds of shows. It elicits great attention and anticipation on audiences when these actors decide to appear in one.\n\nI am curious about your thoughts on these and whether you agree or not. Also, which actors do you want to be featured in romcoms and are hoping to be seen in one?",

Since I prefer binge watching I was able to, with a bit of planning, make **The Glory** my 200th milestone. For those of you who keep track of your dramas how meticulous do you get? I personally just have two categories that my dramas go in, Dramas that the plot is motivated mostly by romance and other, also additional seasons don't count towards my drama total. Share your tracking techniques.\n\nI'm almost running out of new dramas on Netflix which is exciting as I'll be able to peacefully rewatch some of my favorites! But there are four dramas that are available to me that don't really shout 'Hey! Watch me!' so i'm wondering if you guys could sell me on these or just pass. **Backstreet Rookie**, **The Cursed**, **Dear My Friends** and **Boys Over Flowers**(this one would take some serious convincing lol).",

You also brought out a fear that I didn't even know I had, my watch list being deleted :X haha. My reservations about **Boys Over Flowers** is I've heard the ML treats the FL horribly, like I've read comments saying that the drama \"didn't age well\". Was that your experience with it? Love your system btw!",

And I was devastated when my list deleted \ud83d\ude2d I was scrambling to try and remember the dramas I watched and the order. Thankfully I had only watched around 20 dramas \ud83d\ude05 3 years ago and I still remember the moment \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd no lies were told about **Boys Over Flowers** \ud83d\ude2c he treats her horribly throughout. Even his \u201cnice\u201d moments didn\u2019t do anything for me because of how nasty he was to her \ud83d\ude2d The majority of the characters suck tbh. The only people who got a little support from me was FL\u2019s friend and her ship lol. So overall it\u2019s really not a good show I would say \ud83d\ude2d but you can maybe try the first episode?? I will warn it\u2019s crazy though \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd thank you!!",

Because of this I've never really put effort into a personal 'Top 10', but I do have a short list for best cries lmao.\n\nBut to your original question I do have some favorites.\n\nSlice of Life - **Our Blues**: Loved **Reply 1988** but **Our Blues** takes the cake for me. The cast is absolutely stacked with the beautiful Jeju Island as the filming location just is too hard to top.\n\nRomance - This would be way too difficult to just pick one so i'll go with a different approach. **It's Okay To Not Be Okay** is the first Korean Drama I saw where the FL was the aggressor in pursuing the relationship so this one always stood out for me. Another different one would be **You Are My Spring** because I can't handle horror well like at all (I'm doing my best to improve) and the first episode nearly made me quit it. But after a couple days I continued on and enjoyed the rest. So many other great romance dramas i'd be here all day.\n\nMost underrated drama - **Never Give Up** this drama knocked me out of a drama slump so I am probably a little biased. But there were a lot of unfamiliar actors in this drama but they all did so well. There is a particular subplot that lives in my head and I don't think i'll ever forget it.\n\nHonorable mentions: **Alchemy of Souls, Search: WWW, Sky Castle, Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Queens Umbrella, Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung, Tomorrow**\n\nI could go on and on but I'll stop here lol.",

When I think back on this, it brings a slight smile to my face because of the warmth of the family/friends group. There is a bit of romance with a couple of the characters but it's mainly about the relationships between the characters. Overall, I think it's a bit slow moving but I found it beautiful.",

Probably lots of the crown princes were in actual fact quite generally talented, since they had that kind of selection of the Queens, and then a selection of which prince. \n\nHowever, this guy also has perfect memory. I have only met one person with perfect memory once. Apart from the memory, he seemed quite ordinary intelligent. Possibly the memory would fill up such a large portion of his head that all the other parts of his head would loose out a bit? Like the taxi drivers in London who have a larger area than others in their \"find the way\" area. As far as I understand it is not a completely one-to-one relationship between filling your head with something new and losing out on something else, it is rather a one-to-three-relationship or whatever, where you can expand your knowledge without loosing what already was there, but maybe only to a certain extent. I can for example not write Norwegian Nynorsk after having lived in Sweden and Swedish probably took over that part of my brain.",

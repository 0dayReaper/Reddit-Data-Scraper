    "postText": "This drama truly blew me away.  Not because it is a masterpiece of deep, complex characters, a heartwarming journey of growth and realization, and a rich depiction of the enigmatic nature of humanity.  Because *Switch* is none of these things.  Instead it is a masterpiece of deception and playful trickery, a hilarious journey with characters who embrace chaos in the cause of pursuing justice, and a depiction of a simple story that\u2019s stitched together backwards, sideways, and upside down.  In short, although *Switch* is not high art, it is highly entertaining in the best possible ways.\n\nThe first episode introduces both the characters and the world of the drama with a bang.  Almost right away we discover who the characters are, what they want, and what they are willing to do to get it.  Although throughout the drama the characters are given some emotional depth and grounded motivations, who they are as people stays remarkably consistent from start to finish.  *Switch* is an interesting drama in that the central elements, namely the characters and the overarching storylines, are drawn skillfully but simply; however, the cons that take center stage are often creative and playful.  This playfulness is integral in shaping the soul of the drama.  Because of the consistent light-hearted whimsy in the music and dialogue, we as an audience are clued into the overall stylistic tone.  We are thus more primed to understand that *Switch\u2019s* goals lie not in depicting events realistically with scarcely a plot-hole to be seen, but in engaging the audience in an exciting battle of table-turning and deception.\n\nJang Geun Suk plays the double role of conman and prosecutor skillfully.  As with the rest of the characters in *Switch*, neither character is written to be particularly complex.  They do not have the subtle emotional depth of double roles such as you might find in dramas such as *18 Again* or *The Crowned Clown*.  However, Jang Geun Suk still manages to create two characters who feel distinct from each other and also interact with each other in compelling ways.  Both the conman and prosecutor also have opportunities to interact with numerous other characters.  In many of their interactions, neither party knows exactly what the other wants, and this fleshes both their characters out quite a bit more.\n\nHan Ye Ri brings out the emotion and strength in her character as well, although her role is written more straightforwardly than either of Jang Geun Suk\u2019s characters.  Han Ye Ri\u2019s character is limited to more direct interactions with other characters: for much of the drama, other characters know exactly what she wants from them, and she knows exactly what they want from her.  This kind of setup naturally leads to more simple encounters and less nuanced responses.\n\nInterestingly, this is actually in service to the show, and not a point against it.  The soul of this drama is in its playful cons and fun double role schemes.  In such a drama, would it make sense to focus on the characters\u2019 emotional depth and bring a dramatic plot into focus?  Although *Switch* does include a couple dramatic and darker plots, for much of the drama the focus is solidly on humor involving various cons.  The relative simplicity of the characters is an effective conduit to emphasize the unpredictable and wild stings, which are the highlight of the show.  The charisma and charm that the main characters do in fact have are simply the cherries on top.  Altogether, it makes for a compelling story that not only has the ability to draw you in, but also to keep you invested throughout the drama.  So, if you are looking for a show to captivate you, surprise you, and above all entertain you, you might want to give *Switch* a try.\n\nIf you're participating in the 2023 Kdrama Challenge, here are some challenges it works for:\n\n4: Korean Fried Chicken, 5: Truck of Doom, 6: Makeup/Skincare, 7: Hospital, Hotel, Restaurant, Park and Nature, School, Bridge, 8 (Jang Geun Suk), 9 (Jang Geun Suk), 19, 21, 22, 28 (If this review inspires you to watch it), 29 (As I am a challenge participant and I am recommending this drama), and 30.\n\n*Switch* also fits for challenge 13 \u2013 Han Ye Ri and Jo Hee Bong *(Nokdu Flower),* Han Ye Ri, Jo Hee Bong, and Kwon Hwa Woon *(Six Flying Dragons),* Jang Geun Suk and Jo Hee Bong *(Hong Gil Dong),* Jang Geun Suk and Lee Jung Gil *(Lovers in Prague),* Choi Seung Hoon and Jo Hee Bong *(Tunnel)* Son Eun Seo and Park Won Sang *(Queen for Seven Days).*",

Would order again!",

I watched it as it aired and never felt the need to complain about anything, and no one else who posted either.  No annoying tropes, no noble idiocy.  The romance element was replaced by an amazing bromance you couldn't get enough of.  The storytelling was great. The cases (it's a law drama) were interesting.  All the characters were interesting and so were their stories.  \n\nThe villains were not caricatures, but neither were they sympathetic in any way. We loved to hate them.  \n\nThe ending was perfect.\n\nThe only complaint would be that I would have liked a little more fleshing out of the last conflict, I felt some parts could have used more time.  But it's minor, and it's still quite satisfying.",

Also, the writers consulted real lawyers while writing the cases, so they are very real if ignoring the obvious dramatization. \n\n**Now the best things you will certainly like-** the characters, they are quirky, fun. The bromance is the best I have ever seen in any dramaland, their very real friendship will seriously make you envy them haha. It is a rare drama where filler scenes are equally good, sometimes even better. \n\nFirst two episodes are the weakest, but it continues to get better and better. It topped my favorites hospital Playlist and prison playbook from slice of life category. \n\nHope you will enjoy this drama like we all did :)",

And even if I don\u2019t really drink alcohol, had to try out soju just once hahaha still didn\u2019t like it though.

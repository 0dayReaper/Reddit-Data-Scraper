The writer\u2019s just probably trying to make the obvious unobvious lol. I have a feeling that in the end, kang san is cp!&lt;\n- I think &gt;!si yeol\u2019s just a royalty. He probably witnessed what happened to snowflake so he doesnt want anyone to get hurt anymore. Also, notice how that woman in the river mentioned \u20182 princes were close\u2019 it cant be the king and snowflake\u2019s dad!&lt;\n- Looks like Yuha\u2019s biological mom &gt;!is the kisaeng who is also the former maid of the royal family. kinda supports my theory that snowflake and yuha used to be friends as kids!&lt;\n- The casting for dan o and her sister is spot on.

What do u guys think?\n\n- Did they ever mention how dan-o\u2019s parents died?\n\n- In ep4, while Yukho was explaining the annex to si yeol, he only mentioned the stone marbles (graves) of hongjoo and their father. Did I miss the mention of her mother or her mother isn\u2019t really there? What could this mean?\n\n- In Ep 4 again, the woman in the river that dan-o approached, she talked about princes being friends. It can\u2019t be the current king and snowflake\u2019s dad right? There\u2019s gotta be other members of the royal family lurking around that is on snowflake\u2019s side. &gt;!Yes, this is me believing that si yeol is some royal relative lol!&lt;\n\n\nAnyway, just sharing this so i won\u2019t be alone scratching my head about this lol",

I wonder why they chose that term? \n\nThe princes who were friends were the Grand Prince (I think this is another prince who's next in line after the Crown Prince, based on *Our Blooming Youth*) and the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince was the 'jade dust' - missing prince - 's father, but it's not clear who the Grand Prince was. I don't know where the current king fits in. \n\nI think it was explained, how her father died, in episode 3 or 4, but I can't remember what it was.",

LOL all the characters are so interesting and I like that they keep the tone humorous/enjoyable as a generally light watch.\n\nI really want prince to be Kang San but everything is a bit muddied rn and the writers are prob trying to throw us off with a lot of moving pieces. I do love that the pacing is fast so I'm not bored (as long as they don't mess it up mid-way) \n\nahhh I love the romantic moments already they are building up between San Kang and Dan Oh. THEIR SCENES ARE SO CUTE; I really want them to be together since they fell for each other so fast and have good chemistry. \n\nThe FLIRTING i can\u2019t take it lol.

It has just enough mystery to keep me guessing and super intrigued, the right amount of romance to make me smile and squeal, all while being light and fluffy enough that I don't have to think too deeply and can just enjoy a good show. It's really fun to try to guess who is the prince (I know who I really, really want it to be) and I'm curious to see how it all plays out.",

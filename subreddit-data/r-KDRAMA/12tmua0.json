    "postText": "**Welcome** to r/KDRAMA, a community where kdrama watchers gather to discuss their favorite dramas! \n\nThis r/KDRAMA Guide is an automated weekly post that introduces our community features, resources, rules, and answers some FAQs. Use this guide to help you navigate around our community and find resources easily!\n\n**Full Rules and Policies**\n\nWe are an actively moderated community, please review our full [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) before participating in our community. Content and conduct that violates our Rules and Policies will be removed.\n\nNote that the sidebar rules widget in New Reddit contains only a very abbreviated version of our full rules, please do not rely on them to contest any moderation actions, use our full Rules and Policies.\n\n**Browsing the Subreddit**\n\nOur subreddit is most optimized for browsing on desktop in New Reddit where we make maximize use of the sidebar to share the most updated information and resources (eg. schedule of On-Air discussions, links to most commonly used resources and featured posts), we encourage newcomers to view our subreddit on desktop to see all the information. Additionally, due to problems with official Reddit mobile apps, some of the links we have in the sidebar or posts do not work on mobile. If you are having trouble accessing links, please switch to desktop access.\n\nWe strongly recommend browsing our community feed ***sorted by new*** to see the latest discussion posts.\n\nTo view all resources in and information about our subreddit, see our [wiki](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index).\n\n**Note:** /r/KDRAMA measures time in KST - Korean Standard Time (UTC +9) so all references to time or date relate to that time-zone.\n\n---\n\n##Participating &amp; Posting In Our Subreddit\n\n###Participating\n\nOur community strives to be a friendly and safe space where our community members can participate and enjoy discussions about kdramas. To that end, we ask participants to **be kind to each other,** by remembering the human both behind and on the screen -- including the actors and actresses and staff members that makes the drama. Harassment, threats, bullying, personal attacks, racism, hate speech, and other similar negative behaviors are prohibited in this subreddit.\n\n**There are consequences for what you post.** Remember that others do not have to tolerate insults, harassment, racism, sexism, or any other types of negative behavior. While we are not a support subreddit, we aim to be *supportive* of each other in our love for kdramas. \n\nBefore participating within our subreddit, please read our conduct [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies#wiki_conduct_related_policies), [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct), and [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) to understand what type of civil behavior and discourse is expected in our community. Also read our [When Discussions Get Personal](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_when_discussions_get_personal.3A_etiquette_and_tips) for explanations and tips to maintain civil discourse within our community and elsewhere in life.\n\nLet's all live by the Korean proverb **\uac00\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uace0\uc640\uc57c \uc624\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uacf1\ub2e4** -- If the outgoing words are beautiful, then the incoming words will be beautiful, too.\n\n###Posting\n\nNew to our community and daunted by our [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) for posting? The best way to start your interaction with our community is by participating in our [scheduled posts](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/weeklyposts) or [On-Air Discussions](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines). There's at least one per day of the week so that there is always a post you can participate in. These posts are very friendly and community-oriented -- a great way to dip your toe into conversations without the pressure of making a post. This will help newcomers to our subreddit get a better feel for the style and type of discourse in our community, which may be much more actively moderated in comparison to other spaces.\n\n**Scheduled Recurring Discussions** \n\nOur scheduled posts consists of two types: themed and free-for-all. Themed discussions cover a variety of topics frequently discussed by kdrama watchers. Free-for-all (FFA) discussion posts are our general chat discussion posts where as long as you abide by our conduct rules and Reddiquette, you can share whatever you like, including content completely unrelated to kdramas. See full detailed explanations of our [scheduled posts](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/weeklyposts). \n\n|**Weekly Scheduled Posts**|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n||**Monday**|**Tuesday**|**Wednesday**|**Thursday**|**Friday**|**Saturday**|**Sunday**|\n|**AM**|-|-|Who, What, Where Is It?|Throwback Thursday 2.0|-|Late To The Party|Eun Sang's Sleepy Sunday Soliloquy (FFA)|\n|**PM**|Monday Madness (FFA)|Kim Tan's Talk Time (FFA)|What Are You Watching|Kim Tan's Talk Time (FFA)|Weekend Wrap Up (FFA)|Things I Spotted This Week|-|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|**Monthly Scheduled Posts**|Top 10 Kdramas (7th)|Kdramas Made Me Do It (10th)|Refund My Time (14th)|Yes, No, Maybe (21st)|Dramas I Have Dropped (28th)|-|-|\n|-|For all the list makers among us.

They are hosted by volunteers from the community to create a dedicated space each week to discuss what has happened in that drama for that week. On-Air drama discussions reduce clutter on the front page of the subreddit by centralizing discussion and all related content, such as news updates, previews, interviews, behind the scenes videos, etc.. For currently airing dramas with On-Air discussions, no other discussion posts are allowed, see our full Rules for details.\n\nA schedule of current On-Airs can be seen in our sidebar. See the [latest On-Air discussions](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month) and here is our [On-Air Discussions Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster), which links all our previous On-Air discussions.\n\nWant to learn more about our On-Air Discussions system? Feel passionately about an upcoming drama and want to host its weekly On-Air Discussions? See our full explanation, guidelines and policies on On-Air Discussions [here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).\n\n**Drama Reviews**\n\nWe welcome well-written detailed drama reviews. Reviews should be for completed series only -- that is the series has finished airing all of its episodes and the reviewer has watched the entire drama. Reviews where the reviewer has not fully completed the drama will be removed. For those that just want to write a short blurb about a drama, feel free to share in any of our weekly discussion threads instead. See our tips on [how to write a helpful review](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_how_to_write_a_helpful_review).\n\nReviews are moderated according to our [moderation guidelines for reviews](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies#wiki_moderation_guidelines_for_reviews) for content. Other rules and policies, such as On-Air or review megathread rules, still apply. Notably, reviews are subject to moderation for frequency under our [Rehashed Discussions](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_rehashed_discussions) rule.\n\n**Fanart And Memes**\n\nWe have a ***Designated Day***, currently every Tuesday from 00:00-23:59 KST (UTC +9), on which we allow our members to share up to two (2) self posts of either qualified Fanart or Memes on r/KDRAMA. Fanart and meme posts are not permitted outside of Designated Days. Please review our [Designated Day rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_3.5_designated_days) fully before submission.\n\n**News**\n\nWe are not a news oriented subreddit though they are permitted as posts with restrictions on type of and source of news. ***Please fully review our Rules and Polices on news items before submission.*** If you are seeking to be kept updated with any entertainment news other than official casting news, we strongly recommend you seek out other sources beyond our subreddit such as [Soompi](http://www.soompi.com/).\n\n**OST And Promotional Material**\n\nWe only allow official OSTs and promotional material (previews, teasers, posters) in our subreddit with restrictions on frequency and airing status of dramas. ***Please fully review our Rules on OSTs and promotional material before submission.*** There are post title requirements, please follow them.     \n\n---\n\n##FAQs\n\n###About Subreddit\n\n**Why Is My Post Not Showing Up?**\n\nOur subreddit has certain filters in place to identify submissions that potentially require moderation action.\n\nIf you have made a post and it does not immediately show up in the community feed, it is possible that the post has been filtered out. ***Please DO NOT make reposts or immediately contact the moderation team for review of your post.*** Filtered posts automatically enter our moderation queue and will be reviewed by a moderator. Please allow at least 12 hours for moderation action to be taken. If no further moderation action has been taken on your post (either approval or removal with notice) after 12 hours, please contact the moderation team via [Modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/KDRAMA) for assistance.\n\n**How Do I Seek Clarification About Or Contest A Moderation Action?**\n\nIf you have received a removal comment from a human moderator (not AutoModerator) and wish to seek clarification or contest the removal, reply to the comment left by the moderator. Do not send private messages or chats to individual moderators about moderation actions, we consider such behavior moderator harassment. See our [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) for more information. \n\nNote, ***do not reply to AutoModerator comments***, the moderation team does not receive notifications for replies to comments left by the Automoderator.\n\n**What Are Moderators And What Do They Do?**\n\nModerators are users that help manage a subreddit community by moderating the content that is allowed in the community, establishing and communicating relevant rules and policies, and engaging with other community members. [More Detailed Explanation](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies#wiki_moderator_role_explained)\n\n**How Do I Customize My User Flair?**\n\nCustomizable user flairs are enabled in our community (the little banner following usernames). User flairs are subreddit-specific and can be used to show off your personality or favorite dramas. Our [User Flair Guide](/r/kdramarecommends/wiki/user_flair_guide) shows you how to set your user flair on desktop in both Old and New Reddit.\n\n**How Do I Make Spoiler Tags?**\n\nHate being spoiled? So do we, which is why we ask our community to use spoiler tags abundantly in order to prevent this. Reddit formatting allows for a few different ways to create spoilers. See our [Spoiler Tag Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) to learn how do make them.\n\n**How Do I Format Things In Markdown?**\n\nNeed help formatting? Want to know how to do *italics* and super^scripts and bold **things**? Check our [Formatting and Markdown Guide](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/formatting_and_markdown).\n\n**What Are The Dramas In The Banner?**\n\nInfo [here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/ourheaderimage).\n\n**Where Can I Find All Subreddit Resources?**\n\nOn New Reddit sidebar, we have linked the most used resources. Otherwise our [wiki landing page](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) has links to and brief explanations of all the resources in our community.\n\n**Is There A Subreddit Discord?**\n\nYes, [here](https://discord.gg/cRPXv5Z).\n\n###About Kdramas\n\n**Where Can I Watch Kdramas?**\n\nSee our non-exhaustive list of [legal streaming sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) from around the world where you can watch kdramas. We also have a list of popular official Youtube channels for [webdramas](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas/wheretowatchwebdramas).\n\nPlease note that linking, mentioning, or promotion of any illegal sources (eg. non-licensed streaming sites, torrent sites, personally uploaded videos, download links, etc.) is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban. Promotion includes soliciting users to PM for links to illegal sources.\n\n**What Dramas Should I Watch?**\n\nIf you are looking for your next drama, check out our sister sub r/kdramarecommends, the single best place to ask for kdrama recommendations. You can ask for recommendations based on your preferences or you can ask if a drama you are considering is worth watching. Check their [Getting Started Guide](/r/kdramarecommends/wiki/index) before you post to familiarize yourself with that sub, and their [Recommendations 101](/r/kdramarecommends/wiki/recommendations_101) to help you craft the perfect recommendation request post. If you don't know where to start or want to browse past recommendations, check out the awesome [What to Watch Next wiki](/r/kdramarecommends/wiki/what_to_watch_next) for our complete archive of recommendations gathered over the past years.\n\nNote, drama recommendation requests are not permitted as self-posts in r/KDRAMA. Posts will be removed and redirected to r/kdramarecommends.\n\n**Is There A Site For Tracking Dramas?**\n\nA popular site used by many kdrama watchers for tracking dramas is [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) -- the site has profiles of dramas, actors/actresses, and drama reviews/ratings.\n\n**I'm New To Kdramas, What Basics Should I Know?**\n\nFor new watchers of kdramas, we strongly recommend taking a read through our basic [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101), our [KDRAMAS 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), and our [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) as a starting point to get to know and understand kdramas better.",

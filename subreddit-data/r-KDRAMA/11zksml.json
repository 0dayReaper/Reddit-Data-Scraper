    "postText": "I really enjoyed My Liberation Notes, it\u2019s one of the best written kdramas I\u2019ve watched. I loved how realistic the characters are, they are relatable even with their flaws. The dialogue is excellent and shows how you can say more with less. The overall question of finding satisfaction and meaning in your 30s is something very relevant to my own life.\n\nBut I have a question about the core theme of the show - do Mi-jeong and Gu succeed in finding liberation?\n\nThe final scene states the answer is a strong yes. The show ends with Mr Gu approaching Mi-jeong while she narrates about how she full of love. It is a classic kdrama ending suggesting they lived happily ever after.\n\nBut I have my doubts.\n\nGu is a chronic alcoholic who is drunk almost all day every day and has even started hallucinating. Although it\u2019s not entirely clear what he does in his job, it\u2019s strongly suggested that it\u2019s some kind of mafia role. Both of these lifestyles have a high risk of killing him. Mi-jeong\u2019s reaction is to . . . ignore the problem? While I appreciate how she doesn\u2019t try to change Gu and accepts him as he is, you shouldn\u2019t accept traits that will probably get him killed. What is the long term plan? If she asks him to quit drinking or a life of crime, would he agree? If not, then she\u2019s not his number one priority.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was how Mi-jeong almost immediately forgave Gu for abandoning her (it would have been interesting if he returned to find she had moved on). She does confront him, but the scene ends without his response and in the next scene they are smiling together (I feel the show could have done with a few extra episodes to flesh this out). Her character arc throughout the show was her struggle to feel whole again and to rebuild her self-respect. Yet it turns out she spent 3 years waiting for Gu to return, meaning their relationship didn\u2019t succeed in making her independent. She\u2019s still passively waiting for her ex to treat her right, suggesting things have not changed as much from the beginning as we would like.\n\nYou could argue that the theme of the show is that liberation doesn\u2019t come in one moment, but is a gradual struggle throughout your life. The members of the Liberation Club admit they haven\u2019t achieved liberation, but at least have taken steps towards it. Gi-jeong and Chang-hee are better off than at the start of the show, but haven\u2019t solved all their problems. Perhaps, the theme of the show is that progress is often \u201ctwo steps forwards, one step backwards\u201d. But if this is the case, why did the show end on such a unambiguously positive \u201chappily-ever-after\u201d note for Mi-jeong and Gu?\n\nI am really curious about what other people think about this. I read some discussions that were critical of Gi-yeong and Tae-hun\u2019s relationship but generally positive of Mi-jeong with Gu. For me, it\u2019s the other way around, I feel Gu didn\u2019t treat her well and the fact she accepted it, suggests she hasn\u2019t liberated herself from her passivity in relationships. Gu started the show as an alcoholic and ended it as a criminal with an even greater alcohol problem. While I wasn\u2019t expecting a perfect ending, it was disappointing that they didn\u2019t fully confront their problems.",

Mi-jeong's and Mr. Gu's ending came across as another step on the path towards liberation, but no more than that. Although, the symbolism of the coin not falling down the drain could be interpreted as Mr. Gu turning over a new leaf, and deciding to deal with his alcoholism.",

I think that there is freedom in accepting a different kind of love/ career/ family than you expected or dreamed of.\n\nI consider my thirties the era in which my eyes really bean to open to the realities of life, love, and the world. Success began to look different to me then, and so did partnership. I found myself \"shifting the goalpost\" on a lot of things.\n\nSo, when I watched the show, I felt like Mi Jeong and Gu fully recognized the realities of their love (he was an alcoholic gangster, she had issues with depression, etc.), but decided they were happier together and received strength from being together. I don't think that there was any illusion that their relationship would be long lasting, or fairytale like - but they decided to recognize the beauty of it in the moment. \n\nJust my two cents.",

I\u2019m pretty satisfied with the open-ended ending because I didn\u2019t want a definite conclusion, especially for the romance plot lines. I didn\u2019t dwell too much on the romance, and would advise viewers to not get too caught up on the romance because I think it takes away the complexity and poetry of the drama. I saw it more as cultivating relationships (platonic or not) and connections in life that can make you feel full and alive. I enjoyed Mi Jeong and Gu together because they were able to honestly open up to each other and they found solace in knowing they had someone they trusted who played therapist for them. Would I have been okay if they never saw each other again? Yes, because it\u2019s story is about Mi Jeong\u2019s liberation journey and I felt she had made small steps towards that despite not having Gu around in those 3 years.",

After finding that it stood on its side (perhaps symbolizing the \"impossible\" being possible\"), he picks up the coin, leaving the bottle of alcohol behind and walks away. \n\nHe later thinks to himself \"Trudging along, step by step\".

Mi Jeong, who was a lot happier after changing jobs, meets Mr.Gu and starts playing his therapist. At the end of the day, they have a codependent relationship. Frankly, I hated the show with all my heart. The older sister was worse off by the end, and to justify his happy ending, Lee Min Ki got magical powers in the last five episodes (finding dead people). Mr. Gu's athletic career could have as well never been there and that wouldn't have changed anything.\n\nYou are giving the show too much credit.",

It was being very preachy). After a while, it felt like all the characters were the same person rather than being a unique entity on their own. It didn't feel like a natural story to me. Additionally, a lot of the ethereal feeling of the show felt like bad editing rather than clever metaphors (Ex. The still-random scene where they are frolicking in the fields - Imagination? Future? Does it even matter?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also had a hard time supporting their relationship. Mi Jeong was definitely in a pitiable situation with her woes of being the youngest, yet carrying the most responsibility in the family, while being unlucky with her past relationships/exs, but I think it's toxic to go to someone and say \"love me no matter what\" (the whole worship me thing) - in real life, I feel like these are the people who become unreasonable about the dedication that their romantic partners should provide them. On the flip side, we do indeed have an alcoholic who has basically given up on life, and really didn't change anything except rekindle an old flame, which is also kind of dangerous (relying on romance to keep one sober and/or emotionally healthy)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is one of those shows where I \"just don't get it\" - it's so beloved and been analyzed to death. My mind just can't get around the fact that the writer is being overly pretentious...and so the execution of the show just doesn't work for me.",

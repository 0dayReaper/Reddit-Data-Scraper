Rules:

Be kind to each other!: Be kind to each other, remember the human both behind and on the screen. Harassment, threats, bullying, personal attacks, racism, hate speech, and other similar negative behaviors are prohibited in this subreddit. Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette). See our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) for details.

All content should relate to Korean dramas.: All submissions should relate to Korean dramas. This is a minimum requirement, submissions about kdramas that do not comply with or satisfy all of our [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) will still be rejected and removed. Please read our full Rules and Policies before participating.

For content about Korean variety shows, kpop, Korean films, etc. please visit the appropriate [related subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/relatedsubreddits).

No recommendation requests here, use r/kdramarecommends!: The only drama we will recommend watching here is *The Heirs*. If you haven't already done so, fix your life! If you are looking for another Korean drama because you've already exhausted Lee Min Ho's back catalogue ask on r/kdramarecommends.

Do not share unverified news/rumors/blind items/gossip.: All news must relate directly to Korean dramas, be verified, well sourced, and have its original title. Please see &lt;section 3.1&gt; of our [rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) for more information on what is allowed as a self post.

We are not a gossip-centered subreddit, please follow our [policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) on not spreading gossip/rumors and respecting the privacy of actors and actresses.

Do not link or mention illegal streaming sources!: Linking, mentioning, or promotion of any illegal sources (eg. non-licensed streaming sites, torrent sites, personally uploaded videos, download links, etc.) is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban. Promotion includes soliciting users to PM for links to illegal sources.

For our list of known legal streaming sites, check our [Where to Watch list](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas).

Contribute in a meaningful way, no low effort or low quality posts.: Post content that do not foster community engagement or that are considered low effort or quality submissions will be removed. See our full [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) for further details and our [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) for guidance on what types of content are encouraged.

We strongly encourage newcomers to start off participating in our weekly themed threads and FFAs instead of making post submission.

Newbies to dramas, read our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101)!

Use spoiler tags!: Out of consideration for other users, please use spoiler tags when discussing plot points and/or sensitive material. When uncertain, err on the side of caution and use spoiler tags abundantly. This applies for both currently airing and aired dramas since not everyone has watched everything. 

To put in a spoiler tag using Markdown (i.e. you are **not** using Fancy Pants): use &gt; ! spoiler ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler!&lt;.

Our [Spoiler Tag Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).

On-Air Discussions Available: Some on-air dramas have an official discussion hosted by a community volunteer (see list in the sidebar). If this is the case all content about these dramas go into these threads. The only exceptions are news about broadcast interruptions or if the drama has set a new all-time network viewership ratings record. This rule remains in effect for one week after the broadcast of the last episode.

On Tuesdays (KST) we share our creations!: We have a ***Designated Day*** on which we allow our members to share up to two (2) self posts of either qualified Fanart or Memes on r/KDRAMA. Our designated day is every Tuesday from 00:00-23:59 **KST** (UTC +9). 

All submissions should directly relate to Korean dramas and include the titles of those dramas either in the title/body/comment.

For further details about our Designated Fanart/Meme day see our  [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) &lt;section 3.5&gt;.

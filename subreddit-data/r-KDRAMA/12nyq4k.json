They would do it every season and cause me to lose my sanity. \n\nThe Big Mouth/Vagabond writer is legend at that. He\u2019ll throw in a new plot point in episode 15 before he even attempts to wrap up anything. The final episode is then a 1 hour sprint to wrap up 14 plot points.",

Taxi Driver has one case per two episodes format, the cases are sometimes based on real-life events, meaning the show can go on for years.\n\nBig Mouth (idk about Vagabond) had one story stretched for 16 episodes. Lee Jong Suk can't falsely end up in prison every season, his wife can also &gt;! die only once !&lt;. Deluxe Taxi team can however fight little cartoonish villains for years to come and as long as the show keeps its heart people will continue watching.",

Her boss didn't even believe her claims. Her boss is good friends with the head of the Rainbow Team, and knows him well, so the boss think it is impossible for his friend to offer revenge service.\n\nSo how would the writer make the Rainbow Team collaborate with Kang Ha Na regarding her partner's death? By making her a client. Also, the writer wants to show the **irony** in people---that people stands firm in their morals,  but once they're in the situation, they're willing to forget their stance.\n\nSo by killing the partner's character in the show, the writer was able to make Kang Ha Na angry, so angry that she wanted revenge---a stand she once so against of in earlier episodes---thus making her a client. By making her a client, the writer was able to show the **irony**, because at first, she was so against in what the team is doing and was keen on catching them, but once she was in their shoes, she availed their service and was able to sympathize with them.\n\nSo I think, the writer did the best thing of making her sort of an ally---by making her a client.",

                    "comment": "Yes you should. Honestly, I'm pretty picky when come to catching dramas in general. I tend to skip a lot. When I mean a lot it can be watching 1 ep in 10 minutes. But this drama, I didn't skip much. Really everything is balanced out. Also if you skip you might not know what happen next. I think this goes to show that the drama is quite intense and always kept me on my edges. Especially the last few eps of this season.",

    "postText": "**Streaming Source Policy**\n\nOur subreddit has a strict policy against mentioning, linking, or promotion of any illegal sources, including but not limited to, non-licensed streaming sites, videos hosted on video streaming services without proper rights, torrents, download links, etc.. Promotion includes soliciting users to PM for links to illegal sources. Comments and posts that mention or link illegal sources are removed and bans may be issued.\n\nWe encourage our members to access their dramas via legal means as this directly supports the industry. Additionally our policy also protects content in our subreddit from DMCA claims and removals.\n\nHowever please note that our rules and policies are not an attempt to control ***how*** our community members consume content or what content they consume, they are strictly aimed at controlling what sources our users ***share within the subreddit***.\n\n**How To Determine Legality of Streaming Source**\n\nTo assist you in determining if the site/app/channel you are using to consume kdramas is a legally licensed source or an illegal source that is engaged in piracy, we have compiled the following tips and information.\n\n***Simple Piracy Test*** The easiest way to check if the source(s) you are using is engaged in piracy is to see if it carries any Netflix or Disney+ original productions.\n\n&gt; **Netflix Productions:** Squid Game | Kingdom | Sweet Home | Love Alarm | Extracurricular | D.P. | The Sound of Music | Juvenile Justice | All of Us Are Dead | The Glory | The Fabulous | Money Heist Korea | Narco-Saints | Glitch |\n&gt;\n&gt; **Disney+ Productions:** Rookie Cops | Revenge of the Others | Connect | May It Please The Court | Kiss Sixth Sense | Grid | Soundtrack #1 | Big Bet |\n&gt;\n&gt; For other dramas you can use to verify, search for 'Netflix Production' or 'Disney+ Production' within our [On-Air Roster](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster/)\n\n***Other Signs of Piracy/Illegality***\n\n* A multitude of web addresses instead of one singular fixed web address. Are there alternative web addresses offered or has the streaming site changed the web address recently? Does the streaming site often change domains and does the domain differ from .com? Does the streaming site name differ from the web address it is on? These are all indicators of illegal streaming sites, as they often need to change domains and web addresses to avoid getting caught.\n\n* Videos that are not hosted internally on the site, but instead the site links to videos hosted on other video hosting platforms or the videos are embedded in the site. Is there more than one server you can choose from to stream the drama and do those players look different from each other? Do the servers have names which contain \"load\", \"stream\", \"drop\", \"backup\" or random two or three letter acronyms (ST, SB, HX, MX, FE, MD, DO,..)? Those are all illegal video hosting sites. Alternatively, some more advanced illegal sites might not use external video hosting sites or offer multiple servers. However, the video content is usually not served from the site itself or its subdomains, but is linked from a similarly named domain, a common trick used by piracy sites, as most DMCAs only target the public facing site, allowing the site owner to simply open a new public facing site in a few minutes without having to reupload all the pirated video content.\n\n* Pop up ads and other forms of advertisement, especially if they get activated by clicking anywhere on the site. Most commonly, a there will be pop up ads when you click on the search bar, or when you attempt to click the play button for a drama. Illegal sites will also often wait until you go full screen and then open a pop under ad which you won't see until you leave full screen. Since they can't rely on legal ad providers, ads featured on the site might contain dubious health supplements, fake \"news\" articles, betting ads or even ads for adult content (like porn sites). Do not click on any of those ads, they also often contain viruses.\n\n* The website is touted as a \"side project\" or a \"work of passion\" (often that of college students or drama fans). When doing a search on the source, there are no results that focus on the source's corporate information such as its headquarters, founders, parent organizations, subsidiaries, or other business profile information.\n\n* The terms of use (if available at all) are worryingly short, look like a bad translation or seem to be completely generic. Often, when a generic template is used, they are making references to non-existing features.\n\n* There is no dedicated customer service/technical support. Often there is either no contact information listed at all, or the contact methods are not professional (Telegram or Discord channel, Facebook, a common email domain like gmail or a Google form). \n\n* The site offers torrents and downloads, especially if they are free.\n\n* Their privacy policy (if available) is disturbingly short (usually two paragraphs) and doesn't say much except linking you to \"third party\" vendors while being extremely vague about what info is collected. \n\n* If the streaming site also offers an app (as both Android and iOS require clearly listed data that will be collected), it explicitly lists information you might not want to get automatically collected, and that a drama streaming site has no business collecting, in which they inform any users of their intention to collect information such as the video you\u2019re watching, words (including voices) you searched, times you browse videos and advertisements and interact with them, your purchase information, information you favor/share, your age, gender, interests and hobbies, your location, full name, profile photo, phone number, habits of visiting websites, your browsing history and log-in information. They might also announce their intention to collect data they can relate to you from by scraping your social media data as well as collecting your IP address, equipment type, model and name, Universally Unique Identifier, type and settings of browser, operating system, language settings, mobile network information (including operator name and phone number), APP version (if applicable), storage and other IT information. This is an alarming amount of personal private data getting siphoned and is most likely getting collected so that it could be sold (since selling personal data is much more profitable than showing ads).\n\n***Legal Sources Will Have***\n\n* Extensive and consistent branding of their service across different platforms and social media accounts with multi-device support, including on Chromecast/Roku and Smart TVs/Apple TV.\n\n* Content exclusive to them and unavailable on other legal streaming sources.\n\n* News articles about the streaming site being launched, producing and acquiring rights to stream dramas.\n\n* Paid subscriptions available that would remove ads.\n\n* A dedicated customer service/technical support function.\n\n* Identifiable owners of the streaming site, including the name of the company, location of headquarters and clear site information (ownership, registration etc).\n\nPlease note that illegal streaming sites are getting more advanced nowadays. More and more pirate sites have modern design, social media presence (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter) and mobile applications for Android and iOS. Just because a site looks nice, promotes itself and offers mobile apps does not make it legal. Hearing about the site from social media or comments that say \"you can watch xx drama on xx site\" could be paid promoters or bots. Make sure to check for red flags outlined above - almost all of these sites and apps will fail on the first, most basic test for Netflix production originals, which is especially important for users wanting to install mobile apps.\n\nFinally, our subreddit maintains a wiki of known [legal sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas/) that we update periodically. Please use it to find one that is available to you.\n\n**VPN Policy**\n\nSelf-posts about VPNs are prohibited because they are not directly related to kdramas and are considered a technical issue. Users should not seek help for technical issues within this subreddit, we are not a technical support subreddit.\n\nOtherwise, mention and discussion about the use of VPNs are permitted in discussions because VPNs are not considered sources since they themselves do not host any video content. We do not monitor discussions about VPNs within comments to a post.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile we recognize that the increasingly fragmented streaming market is a pain for viewers, please understand that our streaming source policy stems from the need to protect our subreddit content from being taken down due to DMCA/piracy related claims. We are not here to debate whether regional restrictions should be allowed or not, we are only here to present our policy on streaming sources and resources to help users distinguish between legal and illegal sources.\n\n---\n\n*Note:* This post is part of our recurring post series 'The r\\/KDRAMA Approach' which highlights different aspects of our subreddit moderation approach and policies.

Her acting prowess is top-notch. Lee Do-Hyun also proves that he is one of the best actors right now. Jesus Christ. \n\n**I love the camaraderie between village people**. I love how they support each other. It's like Reply 1988 and Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha. It doesn't help that there are two actors from the former. \n\nI don't believe CKH killed the mother and son. I didn't see dead bodies. It is an unwritten rule in K-Drama that unless you see a dead body, the person is still alive. He just pushed the car to the water so he could earn the trust of SWB. \n\nI hope BSS has changed. I love Yoo In-Soo. I don't want him to be a bully and a villain. Let him only be a love rival. I'm hoping for a bromance. \n\nThe village chief's wife is so hilarious. She never takes off her face mask. *She's a quirky character and I like it*. \n\n**Does anyone also think that the twins' father is CSH?** I'm positive that there will be a twist and it would turn out that CSH is the father all along.\n\n**Lee Do-Hyun is so hot**. I don't think I will be able to handle it if he stares at me like that. Jesus Christ. His intense and piercing gaze will literally melt me. *I also want to thank the director for the sauna scene*. He is so hot. (I'm sorry for being thirsty. Can you blame me?) Lim Ji-Yeon is so lucky. \n\nI hope he recovers his memory along the way, execute a revenge plan, and channel his character from The Glory. I will be disappointed if he doesn't recover his memory. \n\nThis drama will surely be heart wrenching and I'm all in. I'm so excited to watch the next episode.",

Seems like next week is where the main plotline with the mother and son (going by the synopsis) is going to start in full force, and these two episodes laid the groundwork for that.   \n\nJust curious though, who have you guys been sympathizing with the most thus far: Kang-ho growing up resenting his mother and giving her the cold shoulder because of his toxic and near-abusive upbringing (regardless of his mother's intentions)? Or the mother because of everything she's been through in her life and her desire to live vicariously through her son which more often than not pushed her to the extremes in raising him? Do you think the show's been doing a good job in making us see both the sides? Or do you feel Kang-ho's attitude towards his mother was overtly harsh and uncalled for?   \n\nAlso, how did you interpret the scene of Kang-ho pushing the assemblyman's mistress and child to death? Do you think he really left them there to die? Or do you think he secretly saved them after sending the photo as 'proof'? The way the camera lingered on his face before it cut to the next scene makes me think he decided to double-cross both his adoptive father and the assemblyman.",

I don't think his behavior is uncalled for. I totally understand him going no contact and refusing to meet his mom after realizing she was abusive. She ruined not only her relationship with him but his relationship with everything under the sun. I kind of understand his mom too, but I don't think anything justifies abusing your child. Her grief and trauma made her like that, but I wish she had realized how abusive toward her son she was being.",

                    "comment": "I might be in the minority, but based on the first two episodes, I definitely feel more sympathy for CKH than his mother. I understand that she experienced traumatic incidents (loss of property, animals, and her life partner), and then later social rejection, but she spent more than a decade ACTIVELY choosing to ensure that her kid never developed any relationships and/or interests, in order for him to reach a goal he never set for himself. \n\nTo me, there's a distinction between setting your child up for success and forcing them to live a dream that was never theirs in the name of gaining power and influence. It's one thing to want your child to be educated and do better than you - and I understand wanting to give them the tools to reach their potential, but she was cruel, unempathetic, unsympathetic, demanding, and forceful. Her response to him not taking the CSAT after his childhood best friend suffered an accident was the final nail in the coffin for me. \n\nI know that we'll likely see her trying to mend their relationship and make up for the borderline abusive behavior she subjected him to, but I appreciated that the story showcases active decisions - and not just misunderstandings. They really emphasized just how much he wanted to appeal to her, his understanding of his lack of agency, his desire to help others, and how his sense of abandonment. To me, CKH is a character that is in need of love, and probably doesn't see himself worthy of it, and in some ways he probably sees himself as an orphan (dead dad, and a mom that never acted motherly and was never fully present). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith regards to the secret child and its mother, I don't think they're dead. There were several instances where the assemblyman and \"adoptive father\" questioned whether he would/could betray them, and they assumed, he **needs** them, but he never actively said he wouldn't. Also, them panning to the innocent baby makes me think that even if he wanted to be evil, he wouldn't.",

I'm not really into revenge plot or hidden agenda that's hinted at in ep2 preview but I believe the main story will return to Jouri village after Kangho's accident. I'm excited to watch the story unfolds and the pig is so cute!\n\nAlso, I still see the big evil guy as Choi Taek's dad no matter what role he portrays in other dramas lol he just has this calm melancholic face so I can never unsee him as the soft-spoken dad. Is it just me or can anyone relate with me here?\n\nEdit to add:\n\nEp2 clearly shows why Youngsoon is a good bad mother. She raises him to be smart but doesn\u2019t realize that through all that discipline she\u2019s destroying their mother-son relationship and shaping him to be an emotionless man. I think it\u2019s pretty ironic how out of the three mothers, only Samsik\u2019s mother whose kid is a troublemaker is the most honest with what her kid is doing in life while Youngsoon pretends she has a good relationship with her son and Mijoo\u2019s mum lying about her fake marriage in the US.\n\nAnd omg &gt;! Mijoo\u2019s twins and the unknown dad!!! The show is currently hinting is that Kangho could be the father. The promotional trailers also show that post-accident Kangho is friends with the kids \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019ll be an interesting sight to see in the future if he really turns out to be the dad !&lt;",

Ahn Eun-jin is very likable in this role.\n* What a tangled web of relationships this drama contains. The aforementioned customer, Ha-young, is the daughter of assemblyman and corrupt former presecutor Tae-soo, who was responsible for &gt;!Kang-ho's father's death!&lt;.\n* I didn't expect Ha-young to play such a prominent role in this episode. But when Kang-ho put forward his proposal to insinuate himself into Woo-byeok's \"family\", using assemblyman Tae-soo's &gt;!infidelity!&lt; as leverage, all of the puzzle pieces fell into place.\n* \"Doesn't she look like a pickled radish?\" The byplay and gossiping of the villagers is a delight to watch. But it was immediately contrasted with the heartbreak of Young-soon signing Kang-ho's adoption papers.\n* Essentially, Ha-young's selfishness in complaining about the smell of the pancakes in the car, led to Kang-ho encountering the &gt;!truck of doom!&lt;. \n* We all know what happens next, and the prospect of second chances and new beginnings is an inviting one.",

But I feel its very relatable for everyone with overbearing parents.\n\nSo far I'm really excited about this show. Pretty sad that it's coming out on a weekly basis. But super excited.

I loved every minute of it!\n\nThey had me hooked from the cute pig in the intro and its little journey to the samgyeopsal restaurant in the opening scene. Lol.\n\nThe beginning of the couple's life was heartwarming, but I knew she was a single mom, so I nervously waited for the \"truck of doom\" with her husband. It turned out to be worse than expected with &gt;!the murder and revenge, a classic kdrama plot that caught me off guard. The addition of the male lead's amnesia and transformation into a 7-year-old in the synopsis make this drama unpredictable, and I'm intrigued to see what's next.!&lt;\n\nThe villagers are everything I hoped for and more, with their hair-pulling antics and on-the-spot baby deliveries. The lady with the face mask for 17 years is my favorite character. Lol.\n\nBut things turned serious quickly when the child grew up, and we saw a couple of \"bad mother.\" word written and spoken already. Ra Mi Ran's acting was exceptional throughout the episode, showcasing a range of emotions from a bright young girl to a bad mother. I can't wait to see more.\n\nI feel blessed to have this, along with Doctor Cha and the upcoming Dr. Romantic 3, to watch for the next two months!",

Samsik is a typical bully but I\u2019m intrigued with the writing of his character as the show progresses.\n\nIt\u2019s curious to see Kangho\u2019s associated with &gt;!his father\u2019s murderer.!&lt; Did he know?",

Maybe it's because I already like the actress very much as her Hospital Playlist self, but I thought she was very easy to like and root for.\n\nAnd yes - really agree.

ML's primary love interest hasn't done much but she usually plays very likeable characters.   \n\n\nI can't believe people actually think that the protagonist is evil. Once he became a prosecutor, he would have gone through his father's case and realized that he was murdered. He then focused on the two main culprits and was aiming to nab them. There's no way he is just using them to get power. Also, it's painfully obvious that he never murdered that mom/baby and those twins are his children.   \n\n\nThe only thing real about him is his anger for his mom, which I feel is justified. He grew up without a dad and had to undergo emotional abuse from this mother.   \n\n\nI also think it's a very big plothole that both bad guys haven't gone through his background. I think that chairman guy definitely knows and can be possibly behind his accident.",

This one is going to be an emotional rollercoaster for sure.    \n\nEDIT: Okay, that was a great episode.    \n\nMy only gripe is with the transitions from one phase of the main character's life to another. I'm no expert in cinematography so my opinion is only that of a layperson and casual viewer, but I couldn't help but feel that most of the transitions weren't smooth at all; they were choppy. This was especially the case for the transition from Kang-ho's birth to his elementary school days \u2013 the 'fade away' effect, for lack of a better term, gave the impression that it was some flashback to the past while it was actually a fast-forward into the future. The transition to the high-school phase with Mi-joo was comparatively better, probably the best of the bunch.       \n\nCome to think of it, they covered *a lot* of ground this episode. It seems like they wanted to finish setting up the stage within the first episode itself so that they can move on to the meat of the story from the second. I wonder if that explains the choppy timeskips. Thankfully the other aspects of the episode were more than good to make up for it.        \n\nSpeaking of the good, that ending?! I'm intrigued, to say the least. The way &gt;!Kang-ho's 'Things have become troublesome'!&lt; mirrored &gt;!his father's attorney being in cahoots with the big baddy all those years back!&lt; made me legit gasp. Looking forward to the next episode.",

LDH is so good\u2026I always find it hard to reconcile him with the gawky teen in 30 but 17 because damn son!\n\nI haven\u2019t actually seen any of his \u201cgrown up\u201d shows because they all seem either sad or serious and now with this one I have absolutely no idea what to expect but that little &gt;!smile and kiss!&lt; to Mijoo in the &gt;!hospital is so heartmelt!&lt; that you already feel sorry for who he is today.\n\nETA: Just finished episode 2\u2026.holy hell, what?!\n\nI\u2019m a bit flabbergasted. They\u2019ve managed to set up pretty well in these two episodes how any iota of niceness, humanity and EQ that Kang Ho had was beaten out him literally and emotionally, and how that can fundamentally alter a person. Yet LDH through his cold delivery, with fleeting glimpses of the empathetic 18 yr old he once was, makes you feel truly sorry for his character and somewhat empathetic to the situation he finds himself in. Jin Young seems to have processed her trauma and grief so badly, and logically I guess that\u2019s her excuse for the way she became but &gt;!child abuse of any kind is something I personally have trouble getting past!&lt; so I\u2019m less inclined to extend the same courtesy to her than I would Kang Ho. \n\nWhich raises the question as to why my brain is treating them different despite the heavy &gt;!implication of him doing something truly horrendous!&lt;. Like others though, I\u2019m quite confident that\u2019s a misdirect and the not so &gt;!white truck of doom that he fell victim to!&lt; is a consequence of him being!&lt; found out. To me Kang Ho\u2019s actions and life so far feels like some ginormously twisted way that he is trying to exact revenge on the CEO and the Assemblyman, but along the way decided that the process of doing so can also serve as revenge against his mother!&lt;. \n\nOoof everyone in this show is pretty messed up so far eh? I feel like we\u2019ve all fallen prey to yet another show poster lying to us about the vibes \ud83d\ude48\n\nAnyway, can\u2019t wait for Wednesday!

But having trauma is not an excuse for abusing your child\u2026 and I don\u2019t feel sympathy for the mother. Every single day she made the choice to abuse him that way, even as he cried and told her that she was suffocating him. She is directly responsible for him developing a skewed moral compass, and he owes her NOTHING now that he has finally escaped the village. His life there was absolutely miserable because of his mother. He has no hobbies, couldn\u2019t eat properly, had no friends and nothing to look forward to in life. He literally has nothing that made him happy because of her. \n\nOn top of giving him a terrible childhood, she continues to brag to others about her \u201cprosecutor son\u201d and soak in the validation from others because \u201cshe did such a good job as a single mom\u201d.\n\nI hate that people are justifying her actions. Her trauma was terrible but her child was innocent. She was an abuser and this boy/man does not owe her a damn thing. \n\nHim losing his memories is a good chance for him to get the childhood he should have had. And a good chance for her to be a better mother. But he still owes her nothing after that. She cannot make up for 20+ years of abuse with just a few months/years of taking care of a man with no memories.\n\nEdit: she\u2019s taking care of bedridden ML now and keeps saying that it was his destiny to be a prosecutor\u2026 but she NEVER asked what he wanted to be. She wants him to be a prosecutor, he never had a choice in his own life.\n\nI will never feel sorry for a parent like that",

And the subsequent scene of him having to throw out the mungbean pancakes because of their \"smell\" emphasizes to me that he was never truly wanting to let go of who he is / his roots. \n\nI am so excited to see where this story will take us, and how Lee Do Hyun will bring Kang Ho to life.",

So far she is potrayed as a typical rich upperclass girl who passes bad comments about poors and a typical character who would go away from LDH now. However there are still some questions and positives about her like:  \nWhat is actually the relation dynamic between her and LDH? There is no potrayal shown about that at all. But it feels like she genuinely likes/loves him.  \nShe actually wasnt a drug addict and that was her 2/3rd time partying and she was worried what would her father think. which i think is different from other dramas.  \nShe also proposed driving herself to give him some rest never seen that in other dramas.  \nSo for this I would like her to be different from other typical such characters who would normally ditch LDH after his accident and change. It would be good if she actually faced the change head on, help him and mould herself as a better character. I want her to be the female protagonist otherwise it would be bland",

While the original show was set in the 1970s and 1980s (present day at the time), \u201cChief Inspector 1963\u201d will be set even earlier, in the 1960s.",

I mean it probably didn't seem as cheesy back *then*, but it's an old show with eh effects and eh acting, what can you expect lol. \n\nI'm curious to see what direction this goes in. It could maintain that cheesy tone since it *is* set in the 60s or it could get more serious to maintain that \"recentness\" of kdramas made nowdays.",

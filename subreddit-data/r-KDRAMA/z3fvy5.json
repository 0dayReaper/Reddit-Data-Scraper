Even FL said in part one of this series, in episode 20 that unlike the other dozens of girls that were head over heels for the ML, she didn\u2019t immediately fall for his looks/handsome face (unlike me \ud83e\udd23).\n\nI love how much chemistry they have as people. Part one was the first time I don\u2019t really pay much attention to how good the actress looks like with the actor, which I thinks says a lot about the powerful script and performances by the two lead actors.\n\nThis drama needs to win ALL of the awards next year.",

Buyeon is also the real sister of Choyeon. The only time we actually 'see' Buyeon (alias Mudeok) was when they were in the ice stone fog which Naksu's soul was talking to her.\n\nTLDR Naksu was just occupying Buyeon's body throughout Season1, hence getting a power up because Buyeon is a powerful sorceress. Now that she returns to her OG body, Buyeon should get full control of her body either as Buyeon or Mudeok. Logically Buyeon **shouldn't** be in Naksu's body.\n\nMudeok never really existed in the main story and was only 'their' alias.",

But it seems it's possible to interfere with your original body even if you switched bodies.\n\nWe saw it with Shaman Choi and the Queen in the last episodes. That's why the shaman always had the queen drugged because when the queen regained consciousness she could interfere with her original body much like Bu Yeon does.\n\nSo we have that precedent. And we also saw Uk's body burn but return to life afterward. After the last episode, I feel we were wrong to think Naksu and Bu Yeon were sharing a body. They might actually have swapped bodies and when Naksu's body burned Bu Yeon came back to life in Naksu's body, just like Uk, because we know she's also a powerful priestess with divine powers.\n\nSo, I'm not sure who we are seeing in the trailers and posters. It seems she's not blind though... so it might be Naksu I hope.",

They barely wrapped up any of the mysteries and with S2 being 3 yrs later, it seems like they are starting a whole new storyline which means they will never wrap up questions from s1. I feel like they will spend 8-9 episodes around Naksu's\"who is this mystery woman who lost her memory\" and will never look back at s1 to wrap things up.\n\n\nOn the plus side, LJW said they started filming S2 1 week after S1 wrapped up so I am hoping they filmed most of Somins(Bu-Yeon) part then and made us think shes not in S2 by keeping her a surprise. Hoping that happens, but all my AOS predictions have so far been wrong \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\n\nExample of loose ends. I know we all have \"theories\" but thats not enough because its not been answered in the show itself which bothers me: \n\n1. How did Naksu end up in Bu-Yeons body when she had chosen someone else originally to do the swap?\n\n2. What happened in the constellation room?\n\n3. What happened inside the lake?\n\n4. What happened when Gil Ju tried AOS with Jang UK?\n\n5. What happened when Master lee first saw Naksu?\n\n6. What happened when the mirror broke? \n\n7. Just how powerful is Bu-Yeon? Can we get a backstory on what happened before the switch, what was going on with Bu-Yeon during the switch and hopefully what happened after that body ran wild?",

And now it seems Naksu was just a tool narrative-wise for Uk's hero journey, the teacher that trains Uk and the reason he becomes powerful, and in the end only to be discarded for another character that didn't even get to show us her POV in 20 episodes.\n\nPlease, prove me wrong writers.",

Actually, since S1 was all about Naksu, I am less interested in her story to be honest. They dropped so many hints about Bu-Yeon in S1 that it would be nice to get her full picture. However, a romance between Uk and Bu-Yeon just won't sell. End game has to be Naksu and Jang Uk I hope. They spent 20 episodes building the romance between Jang Uk and Naksu only for her to have a terrible death. Now if GYJ is actually Bu-Yeon and they show all sorts of romance, I will be less than happy.",

I always thought that for a character that\u2019s supposed to be the main character she\u2019s more like a pawn in the story than an actual main player of the main plot. It\u2019s not her who got the parallel to Uk about being blessed children &amp; such. All the stuff that was shown that she did was impressive but what Buyeon\u2019s divine power is on another level.\n\nI guess the Mudeok character will be the cop out in case Buyeon becomes the main FL &amp; focus in s2. Cuz as much as Naksu was Mudeok, Buyeon was also Mudeok. We even saw how she became Mudeok.",

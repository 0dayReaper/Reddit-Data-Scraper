The first time I went here, I was conflicted so I wasn't able to take good pics while inside the scenic train.\ud83d\ude06 This was the time when DLSR has better shots than camera phones and I didn't want to squint my eyes inside the DLSR's viewfinder and chose to enjoy the scenery before my own eyes.

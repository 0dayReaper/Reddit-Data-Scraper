This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

I\u2019ve seen this restaurant in at least 10 dramas, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a set somewhere.  SOAW was an SBS drama, so probably an SBS set?  (Do the networks have sets?)  Please someone tell me they\u2019ve noticed this restaurant too?  Or have I been watching too many dramas?",

I've skipped through each song on there in blocks of 10 seconds twice and unless I'm really bad at this, it's not there. \n\nI can't find a YouTube link but one instance it's played is where &gt;!PD Choi!&lt; is hiring a babysitter for her baby and it's &gt;!Ji Eun!&lt;. Episode 16, 34:20 onwards for a few minutes. \n\nIt's a beautiful bit of piano and I would like it on my playlists if anyone could help. I'm sure it was played like a dozen times over the 20 episodes. \n\nThanks all!",

I remember watching Episode 1, where the male lead is trying to meet his blind date. He was just wearing a simple short and didnt take the blind date seriously. Background info is that he is just a simple independent game developer(3 person Team) who also happens to have a female close friend who is also like team leader and might have a secret crush on him, but this co worker girl just want to keep him in friendzone. At the end of Episode 1 the guy likes the girl who met that day but his co worker girl also started liking him... Now SOLVED by myweithisway,",

I'm not sure if its Taiwanese or Korean because it was from Viki Original series, where  cast actors are not well known internationally. The thumb nail picture has a food theme and a college setting. In Episode 1 college boyfriend and girlfriend main leads are bickering in intro scene. Girlfriend ask bf not to hangout with his females classmates but boyfriend protested to his girlfriend's unreasonable jealousy because he is  in a classroom mix with female classmates. Thats all i can remember when I look up again at Viki original series catalog I cant find that title anymore.",

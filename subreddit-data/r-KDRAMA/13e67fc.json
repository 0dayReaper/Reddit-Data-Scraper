    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted.

No spoilers in particular but the way the show balanced romance, mystery, legal drama and friendship in a well-paced manner that avoids obvious lengthy filler episodes is really impressive to me and reminds me why I used to finish dramas more often than I do now.  \n\n\nI know this was a better-than-average show for its time (used to be one of my favs) but I think shows back then used to be like this more often. It almost makes up for the horrible cinematography and editing.",

There was a big scandal while the show was airing where [versions of the script were leaked](https://www.dramabeans.com/2013/07/i-hear-your-voice-in-talks-for-extension/) with different endings, and KDrama fandom at the time was in an uproar about it.\n\nIt does have low production values, but it was lucky it ever got made in the first place. KBS axed it in pre-production and it was considered dead in the water until SBS [canceled a show](https://www.dramabeans.com/2013/04/could-we-love-loses-its-spot-on-the-sbs-schedule/) at last minute and needed something ready to go. It was [cast a month before it aired](https://www.dramabeans.com/2013/04/lee-jong-seok-and-yoon-sang-hyun-reunite-in-new-drama/) (LJS is the only actor from the original line-up who stuck with it), given a shoe-string budget, didn't even have promos [until two weeks before the premiere](https://www.dramabeans.com/2013/05/first-teaser-and-stills-for-i-hear-your-voice/), got stuck in the worst Wednesday / Thursday late night time-slot and yet managed to [became a 2013 blockbuster hit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Hear_Your_Voice#Ratings). Only **My Love From the Star** outperformed it. \n\nStill one of my favorites, and a great unexpected success story. I think I'm going to do a 10th anniversary re-watch in June. &lt;3\n\nEdit: Links!",

I agree that shows not being fully scripted has always been the biggest issues with pacing (one of the reasons I almost never appreciate extensions or cuts to ep length although I think most shows are ideal at the 10-14ep range and I don't like the standard of 16).   \n\n\nThere were a lot of shows in this era or slightly after that had the weird genre mix though and I think a lot of them similarly avoided egregious pacing issues because having more going on in the plot is always going to help avoid forced interpersonal conflict storylines.  \n\n\nI will say I remember a couple other cases of shows that dealt with these cancellations/etc. that ended up being shockingly good. What's Up! was fully preproduced after losing its original slot and being pushed back multiple times iirc and I thought it was so great I remember wishing they would pre-produce all shows, but I guess especially in earlier kdrama days there was a big desire to see audience reactions to certain characters and plotlines and edit/change the story according to audience tastes. I just think shows that do this are usually of lower quality though, especially when it gets extreme and they change writers midway (drops in quality of Taxi Driver, Uncanny Counter, 7000 days with you were really obvious due to scriptwriter changes lol).   \n\n\nThen again there have been fully preproduced shows that I still think were pretty bad, like Uncontrollably Fond which had amazing production values but just a so-so story.",

I'm having a hard time coming up with older ones beyond **My Girlfriend is a Gumiho** and **Secret Garden**, but there are a lot more 2013-2017ish that fit the bill.\n\nHaving a more complex plot can also add to pacing issues due to the need to wrap everything up well; some dramas fall into the trap of the rushed, loose-ended ending. I'd personally take a slower start or uneven middle over an unsatisfactory conclusion.\n\nPre-production is definitely a mixed bag. Netflix Kdramas are pre-produced - as are a lot of cable dramas - but there are still a number with pacing issues and horrible endings. A good writer is definitely the most important aspect of a consistent story.\n\nI kind of love/hate the old Kdrama model of writing on the fly because it was basically audience participation TV, which is fascinating. There was speculation that IHYV's extension was given to re-write the leaked endings: one where &gt;!ML died and the final scene was FL wearing his necklace at his grave!&lt; and in the other &gt;!FL lost her voice due to an injury leaving ML the only one who could 'hear' it.!&lt; SBS supposedly wanted something happier to please the unexpected audience.",

I also remember a handful of what were obviously audience-participation choices that vastly improved the drama (there was a show I forget the name something Gentleman about a girl who  befriends her older male neighbour and they switched the second lead to the main lead and kept her friends with the original ML because the age gap was too squicky and weird, I also suspect that Dream High 1 changed the ML in the middle which was also a good choice). Other midway rewrites like giving more time in editing/plot to favoured side couples or characters I'm usually OK with.   \n\n\nBut then there are disasters like Cheese in The Trap where the PD liked the second lead actor so much they ruined the whole show by ignoring the main characters for half the show and then wrapping it up with the webtoon ending which seemed nonsensical in that context. I'm also surprised netflix shows are all preprod because Nevertheless messed up the ending so bad and I always assumed it was to please the audience on the fly.  \n\n\nI agree with you that a slow beginning is preferable to a bad ending, but a messy or boring middle is the best way to get me to drop a show so I never even see the ending. In general I prefer quicker, more rushed endings to the opposite (Call it Love was one for me that would have been dramatically better at 14ep as I feel it didn't stick the landing and most of the plot was done by ep 13/14). If a show has a really complex plot I don't mind it being longer (like IHYV) but the 16-ep standard doesn't always work for shows with less complex plots.  \n\n\nI agree completely that good writing is the most important aspect of a good story though which is why I find it surprising that writing often seems to be done completely on-the-fly or weirder yet when they change the writer for a hit show like Taxi Driver mid-show. Like isn't the writing what made the show popular? I can forgive any number of ills in editing, cinematography etc. if I'm given a good and coherent story but very little can save a bad story.",

They spoiled some things correctly (&gt;!the amnesia plot, the killer's motive, FL's confession!&lt;) but they weren't complete and the general consensus was it was fabricated by a production assistant for the internet fame.\n\nThe speculation comes from the fact the leak happened right before the IHYV production entered talks with SBS for an extension, so the two items became linked in the gossip cycle. Some people even thought SBS faked the leak to drum up viewership ratings for the extension, in which case it worked; 29% is a stellar finale.",

Ok, I also love LJS, so that is always a good motivation to finish a drama lol",

Like when I watched it back in 2013 I remember thinking the female character was pretty refreshing and now watching it a decade later I think she's kind of annoying/a bit of a ditz. Anyway I didn't love her character but I found it OK and really I'm watching the show more for the actual legal/mystery plot than the characters/romance in this case.   \n\n\nMy guess is that it isn't the actress who is bad (I haven't watched Mine but plenty of people loved her in that) but rather the 'simplistic' writing of the character, and the fact that when we 'hear her thoughts' it's during these distractingly edited freeze frame moments which take the emotional gravity out of the scenes somewhat.",

I thought it was so poorly done - it actually made me think that the drama was much older than 2013, tbh. \n\nBut, as I\u2019ve just mentioned in my other comment, the fact that I watched it almost ten years later certainly influenced how I perceived the characters and editing. Imho though, there are other dramas that have aged better in this sense, such as the Reply Series (even Reply 1997, which is my least favourite, had a very small budget compared to the other two, but it didn\u2019t make me cringe as much as IHYV\u2026).",

That being said though there are definitely many shows from that era that aged AMAZINGLY from an editing/cinematography perspective - Liar Game comes to mind for e.g. - but they were more out of the typical kdrama mold.",

Having watched dramas that used CGI during the same period - like **Faith** - I'm frankly glad they went with that option because it aged much better than the alternative.\n\nAnd the match-cuts are still A+, like when FL is talking to her mother on the phone at the bus-stop. &gt;!Violence is censored, so they couldn't show FL's mother being beaten by the killer; instead they show FL beating her heels against the bench to clean them, and cutting to the wounds on her mother.!&lt; Both foreshadowing and thematic tension.\n\nDitto for the visual motifs. Using FL's rooftop balcony as an extended metaphor for emotional distance was well done. &gt;!In the first half, ML is always framed on the ground looking up at her on the balcony; in the second half, they've switched places because FL sees ML as unattainable. And when she finally tells him she loves him, they meet in the middle; she runs down to him and he runs up to her.!&lt; Not super subtle, but very satisfying.",

They could even do this with less footage to make the timing more natural just by cutting to each character at different times between dialogue etc. or even slowing down the frame rate but the random freezeframes I found VERY distracting one because we're supposed to interpret him as 'hearing' thoughts in real time (why he wears headphones etc) so why it needs to be frozen for long pieces of text is beyond me, just fix the scripting/editing and second because it was usually multiple freeze frames accompanied by cheesy music, idk it really took me out of the scenes. I agree there should not have been weird CGI effects either.  \n\n\nI agree that some of the editing like in the scene talking to her mom was amazing, I guess I'm thinking of only certain scenes where I really hate the editing because you're right that others were really good and clever for their time (the bit where he's fixing the door is another good one that comes to mind).",

I get what you're saying, something about the character doesn't sit quite right. She's really sophisticated and complex as a lawyer and when it comes to her revenge/rivalry with the former classmate, but then when it comes to the romance elements she becomes this totally different person with very unsophisticated/phoned in trope thoughts like 'I  hope he doesn't like me... because reasons' and 'oh no, a younger guy!' It felt a little cheap.  \n\n\nThe other thing I'll say bothers me the most about this show now that I've seen 'better' legal shows like Hyena, Miss Hammurabi and Extraordinary Attorney is that literally every courtroom scene seemed to last like 2 hours and they were ALL with the same three judges, prosecutor, and lawyers. Like there were maybe two scenes that had different defense attorneys but they all had the same prosecutor and judges. This is just way too unrealistic and broke the 4th wall for me a little (unintentionally).",

She\u2019s written as a 24 year old female pretending to be a 24 year old man. But her mannerisms and her dialogue didn\u2019t match. She was klutzy and silly and reacted to things like she was portraying a growing 12 year old boy or someone with head trauma.  So when the romantic scenes started I didn\u2019t feel like I was watching a adult woman finally experiencing things she\u2019s only yearned for while seeing other people date or consuming popular media.  *Instead I felt like I was seeing a preteen being sexually groomed by an adult man.*  It felt icky and even the time jump near the end couldn\u2019t fully make up for it.",

Even though some aspects of the kdrama production industry has changed (rise of cable stations and OTTs so the Big 3 aren't so big anymore), some things stay the same (the PPL joke was *still* hilarious)! Enjoying this rewatch quite a bit so far.\n\nMaking slow progress on **Gye Baek** mostly because I've grown attached to the characters but the flow of history dictates that they must have tragic endings. It's always interesting to watch sageuks about time periods where little written record has survived and seeing how writers *reimagine* that world and the people living in it.",

My feelings about it are mixed--and I just saw a major spoiler for it last night (my fault, I knew it was a spoiler. I already knew &gt;!that the drama had a sad ending!&lt;, but I didn't know the details).  My feelings are mixed because I am finding it difficult to get into the story. I'm watching more because I want to finish than because I'm fully invested. I'm fascinated by the history, but the plot is complex and difficult to follow (especially since I may go a week or so between episodes). \n\n&gt;!Also I found the shift in the relationship between Eugene and Ae Shin between episodes 11 and 12 to be rather abrupt. First, she decides to keep her distance, knowing that they can't be together. But then, suddenly, at the end of episode 12, she decides that she wants to spend time with him. I can get her coming to a decision to spend time with him while she could, but I didn't feel like this change was adequately motivated.!&lt;\n\nAnd why is this drama 24 episodes? I'm barely halfway through! \n\nI am trying to find a second kdrama to watch in the meantime--something a bit lighter and more engaging.",

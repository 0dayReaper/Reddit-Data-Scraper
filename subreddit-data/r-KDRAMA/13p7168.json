That doesn\u2019t even touch on the fact she\u2019s a great actress with a diverse catalogue. \n\nIt\u2019s so annoying that they do that and then get mad when everyone goes and gets the eyes nose and lips combo and be looking a like.",

She's gorgeous imo, and not in a  way some women are concidered beautiful even when they're not very pretty, but in a \"is there really doubt about it?\" kind of way. I need to speak to these casting directors asap",

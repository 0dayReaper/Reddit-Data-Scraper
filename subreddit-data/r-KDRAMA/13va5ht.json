Don't know about thier age in screenplay. I just can't relate to any 36 year old acting like this. They should have made the lead carachters more mature or hired younger actors. 36 is old enough to have kids in school not acting kids.",

AND WE'RE LITERALLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE DRAMA. \n\n&gt;!We did get that beach scene where they seemed to briefly emotionally connect... Only to be interrupted YET AGAIN before they actually have an honest conversation!&lt; I need some sort of substance to get me to root for them but, right now, I'm not really seeing any of it. \n\nidk how long they're gonna drag this out but I am sincerely hoping they won't end up cramming all emotional development towards the last few episodes... Which I see this drama totally doing but I can still hope!!",

However the execution of the trope (and the very many other tropes they've done, might I add) is done very badly. There's no real context to them since, as I have said, there isn't much of an emotional connection between the two leads. \n\nI'm still hoping for the best but right now I've decided to drop it until real development comes along. My worst fear is that they're gonna drag it out till the end which I'm almost certain they'll end up doing. \n\nIt's a shame, really. Donghae and Hayoon have great chemistry and to see it go to waste because of bad writing is just painful.",

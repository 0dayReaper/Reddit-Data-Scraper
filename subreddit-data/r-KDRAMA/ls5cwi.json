I think Netflix subs tend to \"localize\" certain words that are specific to Korean culture/language, while fansubbers opt not to translate certain words and instead add translators notes explaining them the first time they appear. I think Netflix's method is more accessible for non-Kdrama fans, but I much prefer the Viki/fansubber method.",

So if you don\u2019t normally enjoy romantic comedies, you probably *still* won\u2019t like Korean romantic comedies. But if you head over to /r/kdramarecommends and list some of the specific movies and tv shows you normally like to watch, you can get a list of kdrama titles that are similar. That way, you\u2019re more likely to find something you\u2019ll actually enjoy.\n\nAs for Netflix, they\u2019re a fairly new player in the kdrama world and have only originally produced a handful of dramas so far. You can read [this interview by the screenwriter of Kingdom](https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2020/03/17/2001367/kingdom-creator-wants-zombie-series-run-10-seasons) where she talks about how much she enjoyed working with Netflix because it freed her from the content restrictions of Korean television (for example, she got to show full decapitations of the zombies! Yay!) and from pressures for ratings, product placement (advertising), etc. \n\nThe vast majority of kdramas you\u2019ll currently find on Netflix have absolutely nothing to do with Netflix at all. They were produced by other companies for Korean tv and Netflix just licensed them for streaming. The original kdramas tend to fall in two categories - the ones that are produced for **television** channels like SBS tend to not be as dark in content and include a lot more product placement (mmm... this chicken is delicious! Anyone want a Subway sandwich?). Kdramas produced for **cable** channels like OCN (the Korean version of HBO) will often be more mature but they\u2019ll still have content restrictions that look odd to Western viewers, like blurring out knives. Again, none of this has anything to do with Netflix. That\u2019s why this article is so exciting - Netflix underwriting more original Korean content could be a game-changer in terms of content.\n\nEDIT: Fixed typo",

There\u2019s nothing in tv land like the thrill of Memories of Murder, parasite, the host, the handmaiden, good, the bad, the weird, save the green planet, oasis, Oldboy, mother. I did enjoy most of crash landing on you, my mister. Signal, Stranger, and While You Were Sleeping. some other shows were decent but made me think of daytime American soap operas except with year long plots squeezed into one season by comparison or even Scandal (soapy American drama) a bit. Also Hospital playlist reminded me of Call the Midwife a lot so There s a wide range of types of shows.",

Viki is another distributor and has a lot of high profile shows - but they aren't footing the bill for the actual production of the program - just paying for the distribution deal in most cases.\n\nThink about what you're suggesting: a Korean company will setup multiple seasons of a show because they think *American audiences are used to the multi-season format*? Netflix is an international service and these distribution deals cover the rest of the world, not just America. These shows are relatively expensive and need to have success domestically first for more seasons to be feasible. A multi-season Netflix distribution deal isn't going to cover the cost of a program if they aren't pulling in numbers at home. \n\nPeople don't just pick up a show *because* it has multiple seasons, either. In fact, the last few years have shown an increase in mini-series and limited series in the West with shows on premium networks. \n\nJust because a show blew the ending doesn't mean it's Netflix's fault lol.",

I actually don't understand the reference to the ending for CLOY because it resolutely ended the show in a manner that was bittersweet,  but then their whole relationship was bittersweet as well.  Memories of Alhambra definitely left it open for an additional season,  but I can't think of a way that second season would be as gripping as the first.  I just thought those endings were purposeful for some other reasoning I didn't understand.  \n\nAs an American, I enjoy the 16-episode shows because it's enough to tell the story without getting stale and overly repetitive (usually).  If the show has enough original,  unique material to warrant a second season,  then I'm good with additional seasons. Most of the kdramas I've seen have been able to tell the story and wrap the plot in one season, so it feels right to end it there, even if I'm not 100% happy with the ending (I'm looking at you,  CLOY).",

I enjoy KDrama for two main reasons, the variety in the romance selection and the length of most series. Most of the ones I've seen have wrapped up mostly cleanly (looking at you Cheese in the Trap) in about 16-25 episodes. They follow a relatively similar formula for when you can expect things to happen and on those fronts I absolutely love them. I don't think I'd have the same level of interest if many of the new releases started being serialised as I like to know that there's a clean ending to what I'm watching before going in.",

The first episode with the huge fight scene alone was probably more expensive than anything else they did in the show. \n\nI'm talking about those slice of life romance/romcoms that are grounded in reality. Netflix coming through with a full budget won't make a difference to those, as the investment is much cheaper (and there are typically less SFX/stunts/etc.). \n\nCrossover appeal refers to something appealing to two different audiences. In this case, it refers to a show appealing to the domestic Korean audience that watches  kdramas and the international audience that might not be interested in kdramas. Kingdom and other zombie properties (like Train to Busan) have crossover appeal because the zombie genre is universal. The action scenes + zombie theme open more doors than say, a romance show about an older woman who is ostracized for her relationship with a younger man and deals with sexism in the workplace (Something in the Rain is a show that also needs some understanding of Korean work and social culture to fully *get*).",

Yes, the first few episodes were the most expensive, but I think the rest shows nicely that you don't necessarily have to spend huge amounts to make a believable fantasy drama. It is a bit of a shame you haven't seen DotS, which was a really high budget drama for when it was filmed, as it had no fantasy elements and managed to be a great action romcom. \n\nMaking the budget larger does really help romcoms and not only with filming in better locations with actors that command large paychecks and expansive OSTs. A lot of it has to do with how much budget they have to properly research the plot and how much time and people they have to make the drama more coherent. PPL is a great way to tell how many assistant writers the budget allowed because with more manpower and time (which both require money) the PPL will fit into the drama better and won't feel as forced. Filming a by-the-numbers romcom is relatively cheap, but increasing its quality costs a lot of money. It's similar to thrillers, as they also greatly benefit from additional investment. \n\nI'm not trying to say action dramas don't need a larger budget for stunts, but that saying \"a full budget won't make a difference to\" romcoms is, in my opinion, wrong. Likewise, some of the best suspense/thriller kdramas I watched didn't have crazy stunts - Life, for example, was gripping and amazing. The majority of budget in Life obviously went to picking a good cast and really researching the plot and it showed. Both romcoms and thrillers can greatly benefit from more money for action and stunts, but I wouldn't say that one requires it and the other doesn't. I'd say there are romcoms which are cheap to film and thrillers which are cheap to film, but that there are also romcoms which are expensive to film and thrillers which are expensive to film.\n\n&gt; Crossover appeal refers to something appealing to two different audiences.\n\nAh, your sentence makes so much more sense now! Sorry that I needed to ask you to explain in order to understand; the second I read \"crossover\" my brain went straight for the Marvel universe. Yes, when looking for universal appeal, the drama has to be based on characters that are easy to relate to and plots which are, well, universal. Any drama that greatly depends on the social or work culture is bound to have a hard time with first-time drama watchers. But I'd say love is about as universal as hatred of zombies? Weightlifting Fairy, Oh My Venus and Terius are all romcoms that don't hinge on the viewer to understand the culture to be appealing, unlike Something in the Rain. I do, however, understand that (a massive generalisation I'm making here, please don't get angry) men would be more inclined to watch an action-packed drama than a romcom when browsing Netflix, and that makes it easier for couples to watch a thriller together than to experiment with romcoms. Asian filming is most famous worldwide for its horror movies and thrillers do seem like a natural next step. I'm under no illusion that most Western audiences are familiar with kdramas when kpop has only recently started becoming mainstream.",

The reason for bringing up genre in the first place is that fantasy shows tend to have a need for more production cost (whether it's CG work, set design, etc.). Besides the big fight scenes, Goblin also filmed internationally (probably with some help of a Canadian film tax break) and had a number of stunts. \n\nOf course a show like CLOY can also command a bigger budget due to the star power and filming locations without needing to venture into sci-fi or fantasy, but the biggest budget shows in kdrama history almost all have an action component to them. \n\nYou're right, making the budgets larger for any project will certainly help ANY program be made - but that's not really my point. Romance/slice of life shows are much cheaper to make because they don't have to accommodate CG, intricate sets, stunts, etc. - and the networks know that. No network is going to greenlight a slice of life romance with the budget of a big action show. For every CLOY, there are probably 10+ romance shows made for a fraction of the budget.",

Since Netflix drops all the episodes at once, creators/writers/editors can be more free with how they want the story to flow (think Stranger Things and how the episodes are all different lengths and aren't forced into a specific time slot, so it flows like one very long movie). I'm sure Netflix has the data to back up their decision for leaning into their niche of sci/fi/fantasy/horror (Sweet Home, Space Sweepers, Kingdom, The School Nurse Files). Characters can curse a lot more and product endorsements don't need to be fit in. If anything, I think it will be healthy for Korean media to have a disruptor like Netflix - maybe the stalwart networks will think a little more on what to produce, with the end goal being that we, the consumer, all benefit from (hopefully) better and better kdrama production!",

The industry considers them as long movies essentially. That is why until recently mini-series are either premium TV or seasonal specials (see all of the \"A Christmas Carol\" renditions over the years).\n\nThe mini-series format has largely been pushed out of broadcast TV because the networks found better profit margins with serial TV. By the 90s, this caused the mini-series format to find a home in premium TV like HBO. It was not until the 2010s when more film talent began to work on TV shows that the mini-series format has found its way back into broadcast TV.\n\nK-dramas are fantastic, but their influence on the Hollywood industry is still very minor. Netflix themselves have always been interested in the mini-serial format. Streaming services don't have the infrastructure to create TV on the scale of broadcast networks. They are happy to just buy completed productions or green-light ones that no network has picked up. This new demand has really out the productions that are somewhere between blockbusters/HBO and indie projects.",

They were using the word \"mature\" as in how games are often rated M for \"mature\" due to the content (violence, cursing, etc) not being suited for a younger age group. It has nothing to do with intelligence or emotion or how good the writing is. \n\nAlso, they weren't wrong in saying that Netflix guarantees writers \"more creative freedom.\" Writers who work with Netflix have more control over the direction of their work because they aren't bound by a set episode length standard and don't have to abide by censorship laws that Korean TV networks set. For example, lots of Korean channels require things like knives, cigarettes, bloody body parts, and sex scenes (aka \"mature content\") to be blurred out, toned down, or completely admitted, so if you wanted to create a dark type of story for older audiences that featured any of that stuff, having to blurr it out or remove it could effect the creative vision of the writer and the story.",

There is plenty of sexual content in k-dramas.

I mean that it is both mature in content and the handling of it. And some of that stuff is sexier than anything I\u2019ve seen before.

I wasn't referring to \"mature\" as in sexual content explicitly. I'm talking about more developed relationships. I'm tired of the whiny, teen (sometimes even adult) relationships that take 15 episodes to even start. I want real adult relationships and stories to be told without censorship and only Netflix has shown capable of that up until now. I love Non-Netflix Kdrama's but I also love what Netflix is able to do with them. Again, I'm not sure why that \"disturbs\" you.",

I was disturbed by the idea that putting our American stamp can improve something so drastically. Something that isn\u2019t broke.  If you truly believe only Netflix is capable of creating what you\u2019re looking for, your sample size is small or your understanding of what Netflix has actually produced isn\u2019t correct. Sure there are plenty of stories as you describe. The whiny relationships which take 15 episodes to start. To me there are infinitely more which do not fit that description. (And as an aside I\u2019m also curious to know at what moment you consider a relationship to \u2018start\u2019, as that is somewhat subjective). I am curious to know which k-dramas Netflix has produced fit the description you are looking for, as I do think it\u2019s possible we just aren\u2019t on the same page here. As far as I know, though Netflix calls many programs \u2018originals\u2019, currently most shows are only licensed by Netflix, not produced. I know Kingdom and Extracurricular were for sure, and I\u2019m sure there are some others. But the majority are actually licensed shows produced and created by Korean networks. This will change in the coming year as they have moved heavily into actual production. My concern and my feeling of being disturbed is this: the idea that Americans will go into an industry that is already thriving and improve it. This is American imperialism and I\u2019m against it for largely ethical reasons, but also selfish ones: I am simply in awe of Korean shows and find American television to be insipid and derivative as a whole. I don\u2019t want Korean shows to become Korean/American shows. Suggesting we can go in with fat wallets and improve something that is already magnificent is disturbing to me. That\u2019s my pitch.",

I like the current trend where K-dramas are 16 episodes or less, instead of stretching for multiple seasons. The content in Netflix also quite Westernised - majority are either made in the West or made to appeal to a Western audience. Korean dramas are instead made to appeal to a domestic/Asian audience in general, which makes it more relatable for me. The current system of multiple Korean companies competing amongst themselves to creates dramas, actually works quite well and produces good content. Netflix obviously wants to ride on this trend, but I hope they don't end up spoiling the K-drama market altogether.",

The dramas were intended to be first shown to a domestic audience; Netflix just got the exclusive license to broadcast overseas. I am talking about the Netflix original series (all Western of course) which I find quite unrelatable.\n\nThe humour and interactions in many Western shows is a bit of the \"in your face\" kind. There is not a lot of focus on the emotional aspects, instead reliance is more on catchy dialogues and special effects. There are also certain things in K-dramas (like the stomach growling sound or the way they show family relationships) which makes it a lot relatable to me. (Of course, this is generalising a bit, but companies usually make decisions based on general characteristics)\n\nPersonally, I always prefer content to be produced and funded by the local companies of that region, as it helps to retain a degree of authenticity.\n\nThe scenario I am afraid of is where Netflix starts creating \"original\" series which are meant for Netflix only (skipping over the domestic TV channels). This gives Netflix more influence over the storyline and other creative aspects. The downside is, they might just tweak it to appeal to a Western audience.",

I don't feel like this needs elaboration.\n\n2) They've gotten into creating dramas that are set up to add another season. I'm worried that we're going to end up with another drama like Vagabond, which clearly set up for a second season that is not going to happen. (I believe Vagabond was a Netflix production, but could be wrong).\n\n3) I think my biggest worry is that they'll try to Westernize the genre. \n\nOn a brighter note: They've had some really stellar content and I'm hoping that will continue. Busted is so amazing, and I hope they will be able to continue to make it. I think there's a bigger budget for some of these dramas which should improve the production value.

Vagabond was produced by SBS and aired on Korean tv first, then merely distributed later by Netflix, but not in any way written by them. Similar thing for many of the other disappointing series lacking a second season like Arthdal Chronicles \u2014 although Love Alarm is actually getting their season 2, so yay! Originally I thought the trend toward second seasons was Netflix\u2019s fault because the timing of it seemed to overlap with their increasing influence in the kdrama market but after some research I think it was simply coincidence.\n\n3. Read [this compilation of interviews with the creators of **Kingdom**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/ls5cwi/netflix_to_spend_500_million_on_korean_content/gouib71/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3), one of the few dramas so far to be completely funded by Netflix, and see if that makes you feel better. From the interviews I\u2019ve read so far, Netflix has not tried to interfere creatively with the dramas they\u2019ve funded at all, and in fact they\u2019ve opened up a lot of opportunities to escape censorship that writers and directors have chafed against. Hopefully - and history would indicate - Netflix recognizes that they shouldn\u2019t mess with a good thing!",

I'm really worried that it's an attempt to play to a global audience, to make dramas more like shows in the West. It also makes me think of all the anime fans that get stuck waiting for second seasons that never come. I have serious trust issues about this second season thing. It probably stems from the trauma inflicted by Vagabond. \n\n3) I forgot that Netflix produced Kingdom. It's an amazing drama and if more of the dramas that they produce are as well done as Kingdom, then I'll be happy.",

                    "comment": "I forgot to respond to your mention of **Busted** - I fell in love with that show too! I had never watched any Korean variety shows before and I thought it was clever and hilarious. So I looked up two of the leads, Yoo Jae-seok (the goofy leader always wearing the dorky detective hat) and Lee Kwang-soo (the tall \u201cgiraffe\u201d with the weird camera backpack) and realized the two of them have actually been co-starring in a variety show that has come out with weekly episodes for a decade called **Running Man**. You can watch many of the episodes right on [Kocowa\u2019s website](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/channel/542928/Running-Man) but they\u2019re also on Viki if you have the Pass. I can\u2019t recommend Running Man strongly enough! It is hysterically funny and packed with many games, races, and challenges similar to Busted, just without any of the strange forced-acting parts because it\u2019s all genuinely unscripted. Many episodes have guest stars so you can check Wikipedia to find one with your favorite actors or idols as a starting point. But the real unique strength of Running Man is its longevity, the fact that the main six core members have remained the same for ten years and their genuine love and friendship shows in every episode - along with their clear annoyance and teasing with each other as well, just like a real family. A lot of the dynamics and games in Busted make a lot more sense after seeing Running Man, so please give it a try! Just keep in mind that the most recent (past six months) episodes are really different due to Covid restrictions because they can\u2019t go out in public as much as they normally would. But the earlier episodes especially would have them filming across entire buildings and small towns in their various scavenger hunts and elimination races which are both hilarious and thrilling!\n\nEdit: typo",

I actually really enjoy the storyline and scripted parts, but I think a lot of it is still improv.\nBusted is done by the same production company that originally did Running Man up until 2016. After 2016, Running Man changed quite a bit. It's still really good, but I prefer the original producers.\nIn Busted, I really enjoy the storyline format, the characters they created and the challenges. I see elements of some of my favorite things from RM in Busted.\n1) Calling Lee Kwang Soo Giraffe originates in RM. \n2) There's this guitar sound bite they use that is directly from RM. They used it whenever unfortunate events happened to LKS, and they use it in same manner in Busted.\n3) The mission cards they received in the first season and the detective symbol in the first season are used very similarly to how these were used in RM\n4) This is a really nerdy observation, but the episode in season one that starts out in hotel room also reminds me of RM. They used to have hilarious challenges whenever they were on location and had to stay in a hotel. They would have the cast wake each other up. It was hilarious.\n5) How the producers treat LKS in season two and three is also similar to the on air persona that he had in RM. \n\nI know I've noticed other things like a weird conspiracy theorist. But in addition to the fact that Busted is just super awesome, I love that it brings me nostalgia for the earlier RM seasons.",

They can make both the traditional 12/16 episode drama or keep licensing them (run on, vincenzo, it's okay not to be okay) and do the serialized stuff on the side (kingdom/sweet home). The issue with Signal is bc the writers/directors/production are based in korea (tvn i think) not Netflix. Vagabond is SBS, so the same issue there. I don't know what power netflix would have besides funding the production. But otherwise I'm not complaining, as long as netflix keeps providing the korean network produced stuff alongside the original content, this is great news.\n\nAlso the budget that netflix provides allows for way more ambitious genres like sci-fi with space sweepers and the silent sea. I like the crazy big budget survival/darker shows too so i'm hyped for squid game.",

The error arose because of the way pronouns are frequently omitted in Korean, but a good subber would've gotten it right because of the context.

But I can see how my wording was confusing. What I meant was that Netflix's subpar subs diminished (at least for me) the watching experience. I was eating up the gorgeous cinematography, then I started noticing how the subs could've been better, which was distracting. tvN spent a lot of money to create a blockbuster opening, and it's a shame that people like me stopped being immersed in it (even momentarily) because of a poor translation.",

Even as we have (mostly) stopped taking physical colonies we have maintained it culturally via money. To me this is a startling example of that behavior. Many comments here suggest that Netflix can only improve Korean content. I think that is a dark and scary view. Americans aren\u2019t the end all of culture. And we aren\u2019t all here because we appreciate American tv so much. Korean dramas work beautifully and are an international standard of quality. Seeing them diluted to Netflix standards, whether via low quality or even misleading subs, or a different style of focus on relationships is not something I support. I have been (very slowly) learning Korean and feel I need to step it up because the more I learn the more I know how much I miss when I\u2019m watching Korean shows on Netflix. I think it is a deep ethical problem to consider that this broad American stamp is actually improving the content of something Koreans are masters of.",

                    "comment": "I think you've raised an excellent point, and it's always good to be skeptical. I was originally alarmed as well when Netflix started dabbling in kdramas, but over the last year I've changed my mind for two reasons:\n\nFirstly, Netflix has a greater global reach than streaming services like Viki/Kocowa which are only familiar to people who are *already* fans of Asian drama. Once Netflix started picking up more kdramas I was finally able to start recommending them to coworkers, family, etc. who were only willing to give them a try because they were already used to watching things on Netflix. Many of the new members of this sub are only here because they randomly stumbled on a kdrama on Netflix and got hooked. Which is a good thing!\n\nThe second reason I'm growing more comfortable with Netflix is that I haven't seen any evidence of them interfering with the creative content of the dramas they've financed. Remember, so far they've only actually produced a handful of titles like **Kingdom** and **Extracurricular**, all the other titles on their platform are traditionally produced kdramas by Korean tv or cable channels and have no creative relationship to Netflix.\n\nI've read several interviews with the writers of **Kingdom** and **Extracurricular** and I haven't seen any complaints about Netflix interfering in any way with their creative vision. To the contrary, they say they've been able to take creative risks that were forbidden by the Korean network regulations. Take a look at some of these interviews and see if they make you feel better?\n\n[Writer finds a home for her zombie fantasy: Kim Eun-hee says Netflix was the right place for \u2018Kingdom\u2019](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2019/02/07/movies/Writer-finds-a-home-for-her-zombie-fantasy-Kim-Eunhee-says-Netflix-was-the-right-place-for-Kingdom/3059132.html)\n\n&gt;Kim believes Netflix was the perfect platform for her zombie world. **\u201cNetflix did not interfere with anything. No matter how I wrote the story, or how many I killed, they just left me to make the decision.\u201d** Kim added, \u201cIn that sense, I think Netflix was the most appropriate platform to be showing [\u2018Kingdom\u2019.]\u201d **Netflix also didn\u2019t limit any elements of Kim\u2019s storytelling, which had previously been the case at local television networks.** For example, Korean broadcast networks blur knives when they are on screen. \u201cIf knives are blurred in a story revolving around zombies, I don\u2019t think it would seem probable.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that Netflix is [better,] but it was a perfect platform for the content of this kind of genre.\u201d The streaming platform also provided Kim the chance to write her story without having to worry about advertisers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to care about product placement. In 2011, when I started working on the cartoon for this story, I thought it would be impossible to put it on air, which is why I opted for cartoons.\u201d Kim added, \u201cAfter \u2018Signal,\u2019 I was contacted by Netflix and was offered [to make the cartoon into a drama] and I accepted it.\u201d\n\n\n[\u201cKingdom\u201d Screenwriter Gives Details On The Upcoming Special Episode](https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/kingdom-upcoming-special-episode-details-screenwriter/)\n\n&gt;\"I was worried that Kingdom would be foreign to others, but I actually think there was more synergy abroad. Netflix has become a supporter and ally that is fearless, disruptive, and unbiased when it comes to new attempts.\" \u2014Kim Sung Hoon\n\n\n[Writer, Director of South Korean Zombie Drama 'Kingdom' on Global Response and Coronavirus Parallels](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflixs-kingdom-creators-talk-releasing-zombie-drama-coronavirus-1290604)\n\n&gt;*What did Netflix tell you about the response to the first season worldwide? What surprised you?*\n&gt;**Kim:** Through social media and online comments, I felt extremely grateful to see even the smallest of roles getting so much love. What was interesting with season one was how global fans reacted and related to the Korean elements in the show, such as Confucian values, hanbok (traditional Korean attire), hanok (traditional Korean houses) or the palace. I also really enjoyed watching the series dubbed in other languages.\n&gt;*Kim, I saw another interview you did where you said you had pitched the idea for Kingdom but no one in the local industry was really into the idea of a zombie show, and Train to Busan was what made the idea more appealing. Can you expand on that?*\n&gt;**Kim:** Before Train to Busan, even in the film industry, the dominant notion was that the zombie genre was a niche genre that appealed to only a small group of fans. This was even more so for drama series. In Korea, TV dramas are usually aired on the so-called public broadcasting stations, and these channels are usually watched by families, meaning that shows are usually rated lower for a wider audience and are evaluated with stricter rules. Smoking, curse words are all not allowed, and while swords are OK, knives have to be blurred out. Needless to say, gory scenes that show harming of dead bodies were taboo. Under such circumstances, it was nearly impossible for a zombie show in which zombies can only be stopped by decapitation to be made into a drama series!\n\n\n[Netflix attributes popularity of \u2018Kingdom\u2019 to technological innovation](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190206000121)\n&gt;\"Another factor that helped the series to flow naturally was a team dedicated to translating Korean into different languages and dubbing with accents that represent each character\u2019s class and role. Apart from English, \u201cKingdom\u201d has been **dubbed** into 12 languages including Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese and Turkish.\"\n\n[\u2018Kingdom\u2019 Artists Make Medieval Zombie Tale Seem Real in South Korean Netflix Series](https://variety.com/2019/artisans/production/netflix-south-korea-zombie-series-kingdom-1203123242/) - Talks about accuracy in costumes and settings.\n\n[Kingdom creator wants zombie series to run for 10 seasons](https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2020/03/17/2001367/kingdom-creator-wants-zombie-series-run-10-seasons)\n&gt;Writer Kim Eun-hee said, \u201cI truly didn\u2019t expect the kind of response we had for the previous season. I tried very hard to bring out the most Korean elements in the series, which I think audiences found interesting and liked.\u201d\n&gt;When asked about the difference between working on Netflix series and a South Korean drama, Kim Eun-hee said, \u201cFirst of all when it comes to working with Korean terrestrial broadcasters, we are never free from the pressure of ratings. And there\u2019s also the factor of having instant and very immediate feedback from the viewers, which sometimes results in having to make revisions to the script and whatnot.\u201d\n&gt;She continued, \u201cThere\u2019s, of course, the freedom of expression. So, things like decapitation, for example, that will never be able to be something that will be shown on TV. In Korea, you know now, nowadays only, you also have to work, even if you were just holding a knife, that has to be blurred. So that was a big difference.\u201d\n&gt;The first season was released in 190 countries with subtitles in 27 languages. It was also dubbed in English in some countries. Director Kim Seong-hun admitted to being initially very worried about dubbing. He said, \u201cI had some reservations thinking, this isn\u2019t a contemporary story, and seeing actors wearing Korean traditional costumes speaking in a very different language can be very jarring for the viewers. But in the end, I was surprised to see how natural the dubbed versions sounded.\n&gt;\u201cI realized that language is ultimately only a method of delivering the essence, which is the work itself. A great artist you may know (Oscar-winning Parasite director Bong Joon-ho) recently spoke of a one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, and we reduced the barrier to one centimeter with the subtitle and dubbing service. It\u2019s tailored to an individual customer\u2019s needs, so you can choose to watch the series in a dubbed version if you feel burdened by subtitles or enjoy the original version if you\u2019d rather listen to the actors\u2019 voices. I hope audiences enjoy the flexibility of having both options.\u201d\n&gt;So, the question now is: Will there be a Season 3? Writer Kim Eun-hee teased, \u201cAs you all know, production of Season 3 is dependent on the success of Season 2. If you support and love Season 2, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to bring you Season 3 with a greater world. I personally hope that the series continues all the way to Season 10.\u201d",

It sounds like a good example of a best case scenario and if things continue along a good path in that way I don\u2019t have a problem with it. In general my replies are directed towards the \u2018we are actually making things better\u2019 crowd who have stated that in their replies to this news item.  \n\nI\u2019m aware that in general shows are licensed as opposed to produced, and that aspect both relieves and troubles me. When a show lands on Netflix we as viewers often lose the ability to watch it with subtitles that are actually correct. So much is lost in the Netflix translations. I know that the viki system is imperfect (a whole other worthy topic of address) but it is in general much more correct, much more respectful of the culture, and maintains the comedy of language that is so pervasive in Korea. Netflix, with rare examples to the contrary, has practically *done away* with hierarchical language. It is something so important to the relationship culture and many viewers lose out on understanding. I believe I liked it better when Netflix was a gateway to K-drama, as opposed to a full on platform. It happened for me like that, with an accidental viewing of Reply 1994. I ripped through what Netflix had to offer and found Viki. I\u2019ve already been through Viki loss of content via Netflix and I\u2019m still bummed that I can\u2019t watch Reply 94 with better subtitles. Having watched 88 on both Netflix and Viki it is obvious that it is a richer and more cultural experience on the latter. I\u2019m currently watching the wonderful Chief Kim (Good Manager) on Viki and it is easy to see what would be lost in translation. I\u2019m convinced it would be much less compelling on Netflix. The explanation of dialectal comedy, the extensive exploration of hierarchy, the many many puns. These would just be lost and it\u2019s like half the show\u2019s magic. \n\nThis being said: if, and this is a long shot, Netflix changed their tune with regard to highly Americanized subtitles, and translated the music, my opinion would soften considerably. Let\u2019s talk in two years and see where things have landed. I am skeptical.",

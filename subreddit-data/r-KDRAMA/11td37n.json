    "postText": "I just finished Secret Garden and loved it!! I thought some scenes were a bit difficult to watch/slow but overall, I'm glad I watched it.\n\nIn the show, Hyun Bin's character says a phrase when he's overthinking about the FL or in other cases and she says it once too towards the end of the drama. When I was watching the drama, the subtitles translated the phrase to \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". I was wondering if anyone knew what the phrase was in Korean or if this translation is accurate/similar to the meaning of the phrase when it's used in Korean? Idk it just sounded really fun to me in Korean.",

The phrase Hyun Bin\u2019s character says was translated the was he said it. I understood the purpose behind his use of the phrase because it reminded me of a story I read as a child about a boy with a really long name, [Tikki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikki_Tikki_Tembo) Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo. Now thanks to u/usingmadeupname I know there\u2019s a similar Korean story. \n\nI really liked Secret Garden. The misogynistic elements were a little disconcerting but a product of their time, and I\u2019m glad to see dramas moving away from that more often. The scene where FL realizes the male body she switched into needs to pee was hilarious.",

It's interesting to see the same stories across diff cultures!\n\nI def agree with you about the misogynistic elements. I was cringing at some of the scenes and the end where &gt;!they brought their children to Joo Won's mother BUGGED ME. Like I thought she was going to let the ML and FL in with the children but they just let their children go unsupervised with someone that toxic?\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Thats a no from me!&lt;! Haha I loved the needing to adjust to diff bodies and the problems that came with it. Obv it made them closer and allowed them to see the world from the other's perspective which was cute. Def love the kick a** FL in dramas now tho. Altho the FL in secret garden was pretty kick a** too. Idk if I would've been able to watch it otherwise.",

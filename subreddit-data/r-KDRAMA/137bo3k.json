He butts heads against a hotshot prosecutor newly transferred from Seoul, played by Jung Ryeo-Won. \n\nIt does give off some **My Mister** vibes as he plays the same likeable, morally upright type character yet always ironically falling into troublesome situations.  It however is less plot driven, but more a slice of life type drama with lots of slow burn character development and ironic humour.  Through their cases they do deal with some serious topics such as domestic abuse, school bullying, suicide etc. but is also interspersed with some hilarious cases like mountain gambling. Also supported by a great ensemble cast including Nurse Chu from **Hospital Playlist** and Ssongsak from **Fiery Priest**. \n\nAnyway, looking through the archive threads from 2019 it appears it didn\u2019t get much engagement in this sub, but I do encourage people to watch it if you are into comedic, ironic, feel good slice of life dramas, similar to **Misaeng**.",

Similar to Hospital Playlist I suppose where with each episode you don\u2019t really know what you are going to get, but you watch for the quirky ensemble cast and the hilarious moments.",

I'm not sure why -- I have no enormous qualms with the writing, the actors all did their jobs well, I love corny romcoms, etc., etc., but I struggled to get through this one. I actually wound up watching it at 1.5x speed at one point lol. \n\nI recently decided to hop on-board the KDrama challenge, so I'm going down the list (some of which I'm not sure where to find based on the prompt), which means that I'm looking at **Under The Queen's Umbrella** for the location of a palace, **Gaus Electronics** for less than 2% Nielsen ratings, **Love Alert** or **Lie To Me** for series starring a lead from my first ever kdrama (advice as to which one is better is wanted!), and a whole bunch for MAEMA best OST Award (It's Okay That's Love, Reply 1994, Another Miss Oh, Signal, While YOu Were Sleeping, Romance Is A Bonus Books, Hotel De Luna, Crash Landing On You and Hometown Cha Cha would all apply here and are all dramas I've been interested in). So much to watch, so little time!",

            "comment": "I just finished watching the 2018 mystery drama **Secret Mother**, and I feel like I would never have known about it if it hadn't randomly caught my eye while I was trying to look up another drama, but I ended up really enjoying it? So I am here trying to spread the word, lol. \n\nI'm really curious about what was going through the heads of the creative team for this drama + how it was received when it came out (according to Wikipedia, it looks like the ratings were pretty low but not outrageously so), because it has a very similar title and kind of similar subject matter to two other 2018 dramas which were more popular? (I'm thinking **Mother** and rich moms concerned about their kids' education from **Sky Castle.**) There was also one plot thread that reminded me of something similar from **Mine**, and another plot point (&gt;!people around FL are conspiring to conceal the circumstances of a little girl's death from her!&lt;) that kind of reminded me of **Children of Nobody**? Absolutely not saying any copying was going on, since all these details are pretty generic, but I can see why this one doesn't seem to have left much of an impression. \n\nSecret Mother starts with a mysterious tutor being hired by a rich family, and the tutor appears to have connections to dark secrets of both her employers and some other wealthy families in the area. I found the plot to be surprisingly solid - the main mystery unraveled well (with a good amount of convenient clues appearing at just the right time, but oh well lol), and I thought that the pacing was especially good! It felt like there was just enough plot to fill 16 hours nicely, which can be a little rare in dramas. \n\nIt's nothing super flashy or amazing, but if you like \"rich people with secrets\" stuff (or like...any of the other dramas I mentioned in my second paragraph) I think it's definitely one for your to-watch list!! \n\nMore spoiler-y talk, for anyone else who has watched this: \n\n\\- The side character rich moms were pretty 2D characters, but I enjoyed how they got a little bit of their own development and plot arcs in the last half of the dramas! &gt;!I wish more of them had separated from their husbands, though. !&lt;\n\n\\- Even though the circumstances were kind of contrived, the flashback to &gt;!Minji's death!&lt; at the very end affected me more than I expected....I hate hearing about things like that happening IRL. :( \n\n\\- In the last episode, I totally thought &gt;!the FL was going to give her husband a chance to repent, or let him live with his guilt or whatever...I was really happy when it turned out that she had just arranged a meeting to get him arrested.!&lt;",

This is the first drama where I've gotten obsessed enough to go back and rewatch everything (multiple times!!) while it's still airing. It's been fun to notice and pick apart the details, even when I have my fair share of criticism. I'm going to miss caring about a drama this much since it doesn't happen often.\n\nI'm watching **Tale of the Nine-Tailed** on the side and should be finishing it up this weekend hopefully, so maybe starting the new season will help fill the void. My impression so far is that it has a great story to go off of, but unfortunately the delivery feels flat so it's hard to stay interested and care about the characters.",

Unfortunately this kind of scandal regularly pops up anywhere soldiers are stationed, including for example UN peaceforce. I expect that we will see more of it in the future, since there are way more young men than young women in most countries in the world, and many young men are desensitised by watching mating online regularly. \"Let us throw some women under the bus to keep the rest slightly safer\" \u2013 except it doesn't really work like that, since the idea of \"buy and sell\" will seep into the rest of the society.",

It's about a married couple where the husband has a dark secret and the wife starts wondering if he's hiding something. Being vague to avoid spoilers but full MDL synopsis is below! Definitely think it fits your request of star crossed lovers as well as action packed/fast paced.\n\n&gt;\tAlthough Baek Hee Sung is hiding a dark secret surrounding his true identity, he has established a happy family life and a successful career. He is a loving husband and doting father to his young daughter. But his perfect fa\u00e7ade begins to crumble when his wife, Cha Ji Won, a homicide detective, begins investigating a string of serial murders from 15 years ago. Ji Won notices changes in Hee Sung\u2019s behavior and begins to wonder if he could possibly be hiding something from her.\n\nedit to add: one of the creators described it as a romance disguised as a thriller lol",

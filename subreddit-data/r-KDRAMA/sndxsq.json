I wish you good times drawing.\n\nHere's a piece I have recorded (I say \"piece\", it was more a study) https://youtu.be/JYDielOvjK0\n\nFor a more polished piece like the one of Vincenzo I do a couple things different:\n1) step one is not the flat like in the video, it's a proportion sketch, then flats placed on top of that\n1.5) the flat would be drawn with a hard brush (like a pen) rather than a soft brush (which i paint over the flat with and which was used for the video)\n2) Use layers (not many, just a couple) for when things overlap each other; like if an ear is on top of some hair, paint the face and ear all on one layer, then hair on another, then copy just the ear and place the copied layer on top of the hair layer.\n\nI hope you do start painting digitally! It's fun and something I am working on improving :)",

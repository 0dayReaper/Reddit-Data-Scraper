Especially towards the last few episodes when all our main protagonists were hit with the grim realisation that they could not uphold and honour their duty as a police officer without putting their lives in peril.

At some point, our main FL started doubting her ability to uphold the honour of an outstanding PO. \n\nThe death of the almost retiring officer was so gut wrenching. I was definitely half expected it when the story took the turn to introduce the characters, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to be struck with such a sense of futility moving forward.",

I always believed that a character shall end up with someone that brings out the best in them and in this drama, Deok-sun's character's core is taking care of people and developing emotional attachments with them. She's like a ray of sunshine and every parent in the neighborhood really wanted her to be their daughter because of that. Taek is the one who brings the best out of her character.\n\nThus when I rewatch the series I just smile at the scene of JH confession because he was not even reduced to \"just\" a second lead even so. There's so much about his character that showed so much growth throughout the series and he was not denied any focus (nor chances with Deok-sun) and that was how characters are supposed to be written. There's so much depth in them and it's just great to go back to them.\n\nPS: Cried on his confession scene the first watch \ud83d\ude0c",

Yes, they give him air time, but after he caught feelings for Deok Sun a majority of scenes following that revolve around her. Like I know that he likes her for the rest of the show after that but his character didn\u2019t spend enough time growing in other ways after he becomes a love interest in my opinion. The ending was unhappier than it needed to be because of that too because even though we see Jung Hwan doing well later in life, the viewers receive no payoff when it comes to the career he ends up in because that doesn\u2019t seem like something he really wanted for most of the show. The only thing his character wanted for a long time was Deok Sun.",

I suffer from the same health condition, as the lady depicted in the show and every pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage.

Some dramas made me picky!\n\nOne of them was Because This is My First Life. I loved this drama so much that I cried (sometimes literally) every time I hear OST or see screen, promo, quotes... I felt a bit sad and had shivers inside every time I heard This time, also Shelter is definitely song which made you cryyyyyyy (especially when you know lyrics), and of course Because you are here - it was song that fully described female lead, her emotions and situation, plus it was performed by lead actress, Jung So Min sang her herself!\n\nOmg, I quit, I need to listen to it again...\n\n\nOh, Mr. Sunshine is another good example, it's OST gives you shivers and makes feel excited and anxious (I just didn't finish it, because I hadn't enough time to enjoy without interruption, so I can't write more)",

            "comment": "Can't wait for **The Glory Part 2** this Friday, I think this is the only Netflix Original kdrama where I'm so excited for the next part to release so I can watch this drama from the beginning. I've seen several clips here and there and told myself to hold back from binging Part 1. I do feel for those who have been living in suspense from watching Part 1 at the end of last year. I think I've gotten to the point where I feel like keeping up with any airing drama stresses me out negatively because of other things in life I have to deal with at the same time so I just stick to completely aired dramas now. I do miss being able to keep up with others with the plot, but I feel like at this stage of my life I should do what I have to do (it's that mentality of \"I need to finish this or else I won't feel relieved until it ends\").\n\nLastly, I'm excited to see Moon Dong-eun go up against the nasty Park Yeon-jin (and actress Lim Ji Yeon playing another bad person kind of role as Tokyo in Money Heist sure had an impression on me). I guess it's her eyes that really make the evil trait stand out and I think writer Kim Eun Sook mentioned that before in some kind of interview article I read some time ago.",

I must say I have a strong enjoyment of the makjang/melodrama genre so anything crazy is definitely right up my alley. I mean, I found the bullying in The Heirs  unsettling too (also by writer Kim Eun Sook), but of course aside from that The Heirs is still a good drama in my opinion and Cha Eun Sang might agree haha.\n\nSide note: I'm quite impressed the genres have been quite different with each drama this writer wrote since one would never know it is the same writer who wrote Goblin for example or Mr. Sunshine.",

This season is going to be so exciting because we'll see the actual revenge bit executed.   \nThe only thing that does sour the drama for me is, unfortunately, SHK. She just does not look the age no matter how much I try to see it and her co-stars look decades younger except the husband guy. The ML and FL age gap is so obvious and I dont really see the need for the ML as well.   \nBut that apart, I am absolutely stoked its coming out this friday!!!!",

Like even when they showed her in college with those hairbands and stuff, it just looked odd and she looked really old.  \nI personally don't think it was on purpose, I think SHK has and naturally so aged in the last couple of years to the extent she cant play late 20's, early 30s anymore. Which is perfectly natural but just the casting bit looked off to me.",

So wonderfully heart-warming and also tugging at heartstrings, full of little hopes but told in a matter of fact kind of way. I absolutely loved it. I was trying not to sob audibly inside the cinema. The acting was brilliant, even the little kid was excellent. I actually really liked the little kid. \nIt probably impacted me more than other people because of the subject matter.\n That 'thank you for being born' scene had me crying buckets. And I know it's not a glamorous role but I thought IU looked stunning. Also loved the arthouse vibes. I was supposed to see it as part of the film festival in November but it hadn't worked out then, so I am glad I finally got to watch it on the cinema. 10/10 movie.\n\nI finished **Once upon a small town**. Overall it was cute, I really liked the ML. I wasn't a fan of the first two episodes but it got better and better.\n \nI also finished **Narco-Saints**. Episode 6 was so intense, the tension was high! I think episode 4-5 was a bit of a low point, i got a little bit confused in those episodes and there was a lot of violence. Acting was good all-round and very high production-value.",

Fortunately, this gives me more time to watch some older (pre-2018) dramas that have been on my list for years.\n\nI'm currently about halfway finished with Mr. Sunshine, and loving it (of course). I put this one off for a long time since it is a tragedy, but it's so good that I regret not watching it sooner. I am a big fan of sageuks, maybe because I enjoy history and politics, so this one is particularly interesting to me because of the time period and the introduction (mostly forced) of different cultures. Also, as an American, I am always interested in how other cultures view and represent Americans - even when (sometimes especially when) it isn't in a favorable light\n\nAnd I am SHOCKED at how much I am digging The Scholar Who Walks the Night. Is it campy? Absolutely! But it is fabulous! So far, this is my favorite Lee Soo Hyuk role, and definitely features the most natural acting I've seen from him. You would think he would be the campy one, but honestly, Lee Joong Gi is the one who seems to be chewing the most scenery. Still, it somehow works! The thing that surprises me most, though, is the fact that my husband likes it so much that he doesn't want me to watch it without him!",

            "comment": "Binged **Missing: The Other Side 2** and it may actually be one of the sequels that I think lived up to the first. The cast additions have been wonderful and the found family vibes are even stronger this time round. The cases remain heartfelt and bittersweet. \n\nAlso the acting. I adore the cast for the most part. I love watching Go Soo, he seems somehow underrated despite being a great actor and super handsome. HJH is such an amazing veteran actor and he really brings so much emotion to his character. Along with Ha Jun and Kim Dong Hwi who also have great screen presence. Oh and Lee Jung Eun truly elevates an ensemble cast, she really brings Captain Kang to life and was the heart of S2 Village.\n\nI just find the characters so strangely \u201creal\u201d despite the fantasy elements of the show. Like in the show, it\u2019s sad to say farewell but I\u2019m also glad to have watched this series.\n\n**The Forbidden Marriage** is surprisingly so fun. I should\u2019ve known, especially with the main actors being Kim Young Dae who I loved in Sh**ting Stars with all his micro expressions (he\u2019s still bringing it in TFM, so good) and Park Ju Hyun has great comedic chops here also, while Kim Woo Seok is carrying a lot of the melo gaze that is required in a saeguk haha. \n\nAlso watching **Crash Course In Romance** but not as obsessed with that show strangely. I love JKH and his acting and while it\u2019s mostly enjoyable, there\u2019s nothing gripping about it yet. I would say it doesn\u2019t need the suspense elements but then there would be even less plot.",

I find watching a drama based on who is going to be in it kind of hit or miss (except for Jung Kyung Ho!)",

His real laughter is highly addictive and comforting, like you will at least smile and feel good if not laugh even if he laughs in a sad premise. Watch him in variety shows, he is a variety gold. He is very beloved in Korea. \n\nCth is neither your top tier actor nor his works are beyond amazing. The best point is, his screen presence is very comforting. He mostly takes warm funny roles and his dramas are mostly simple, so they are good for a mindless refresher. But those who watch, watch for him mostly. \n\nI also watch if I find the plot interesting (like didn't bother checking out park hyun sik's drama), kokdu is sad exception, had to drop it. I mostly watch completed drama to avoid duds and only watch on-air drama if it is too hyped or there is an actor I like.",

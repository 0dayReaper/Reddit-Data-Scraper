More like, So-hot..a. Nvm. But yeah, he's a 10 but he likes to collect human teeth.!&lt;\n\nThe way you can tell these are Korean actors desperately trying to pronounce Japanese.It'd be cool if they hired actual Japanese actors. I would to love see my fav jdrama actors pop out of nowhere in this random kdrama lol\n\nThings were too wholesome and sweet so far. I was just vibing and having fun but ik something bad was gonna happen and here we are... &gt;!wtf was that ending scene?? now I'm so scared for Team Karma T-T!&lt;",

Guess he really wants to test out his trap system again.\n\nIsn't he wondering how they knew to come there for the coins? When he put his face down so close to them in Ep 7 I was afraid that he'd notice something off about one of them.\n\nWonder if Dr. Ko will get involved since he is outside watching. What was it that he told Viper that he really wanted since he was giving his coin away?",

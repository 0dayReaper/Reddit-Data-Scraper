    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.  If you are using Markdown and not  Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way  to create spoiler tags is to use  &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without  spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "I'm off this week so I'm doing a bit of drama catch up, spring cleaning, and taxes. \n\nI started **Secret Romantic Guesthouse** and it was okay. I'm a week behind, so I thought I would just watch all 4 episodes this week. However, it felt like a chore trying to get through the first 2 episodes. I think I'll place this one on hold and keep reading the on air discussion. \n\nI have a really long watchlist on Viki, so I try to choose a drama that's been on there for a really long time when I can't think of the next drama I want to watch. Last week it was **Go Ahead**, which was really good. I'm currently watching **Road Home** which stars Tan Song Yun so when I came across **Go Ahead** I decided to give it another try. The first time I tried to watch I don't think I was in the mood for terrible mothers, but once I got past it, the drama was really good. I've heard people mention that if you like **Go Ahead** you'll probably like **Reply 1988**, so I might give that one a try. Other than **Find Yourself** (which I dropped because I couldn't stand the FL character), I have watched and loved everything else from the screenwriters/director team (**Meet Yourself, Hi Venus, Day of Becoming You**).\n\nAlso on my watchlist was **One Fine Week** which was okay. I like these type of dramas that cover k-entertainment but they never go deep enough. I don't know what I was expecting from such a short form drama, but there was no explanation as to why they looked identical and no consequences for them switching places. I know there is a season 2 but from the reviews, it sounds like it has the same plot as season 1 only worse. \n\nOther than **Call it Love** and **The Real Has Come**, I'm pretty light on the kdrama front. That's fine, since I have so many other dramas to watch.\n\nLastly, I started a cdrama called **Girls Who Sees Smells** thinking it was a remake of the kdrama. Other than the title, they have absolutely nothing in common. I'm really enjoying the cdrama",

I also recently watched **Meet Yourself** and the first few episodes hit me so hard in the feels that it immediately reminded me of how impactful the emotional scenes in Go Ahead were. After those emotional scenes in Meet Yourself, I looked up the director and was not at all surprised to find that it was the same director as Go Ahead. I didn't realize that it was a writer/director duo that had done more dramas than just those 2 though, so I'll have to check out their other works. Thanks for the heads up!",

It was on my radar when it was released but I just never got to it; then after hearing a friend dropped it, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was worthwhile despite the higher MDL rating. \n\nThe first few episodes still had me questioning it, but I think it picked up around episode 5 and I\u2019ve been hooked since! I\u2019m not really a fan of slapstick so it often felt like too much, but I\u2019m surprised at how much the tone has changed, especially in these last few episodes.

            "comment": "I have a problem with a couple of things in fantasy series, both Western and Korean. Admittedly I haven't read any fantasy for many years, and now I only watch Korean, so it might have gone out of fashion in US/Europe.\n\nBy the way, Terry Pratchett's writer advice is to read books in other genres to be a better writer, or you would just subconsciously copy what other people have written.\n\nOne problem is the person who is exceptionally skilled, usually magical since I am talking fantasy here, but from poor background. Then half way in we find out that actually this person has some high status ancestry, and don't deserve to be poor. So, it is true that IQ (a measure that measures itself, but it is the closest thing we get to measure intelligence) is to a large extent inheritable, but IQ is also very much affected by nutrition, infections etc. Which makes a poor person stupid, if they grew up with less than adequate nutrition. Smartness is not that scarce that only the wealthiest have those genes. To get to the top in society you might not need as much smartness as you need various other traits, like eagerness to climb up and step on others. \n\nAnd another problem with this is: Do stupid people not deserve a good life? \n\nSo this person deserves to be a king, and will be a good king, because some ancestor managed to manipulate himself into that position. While the person who has the throne now is bad, because somehow a good ruler is born through the Y-chromosome. (Actually, in **Alchemy of Souls** &gt;!this trope is reversed, which is very nice!&lt;.  \n\nThen the problem of *loyalty in itself being a good thing*. I haven't seen this a lot in Western fantasy books, though. Clearly, if you are not loyal to the present government, there might be war or other kinds of destructive problems. To be loyal is a good thing, to a certain extent. Even if I think a rule is stupid, sometimes I must follow it, for the sake of the order in society. But I read a book about \"why do some countries have genocide\", and one answer was that discipline and loyalty was seen as a good thing in itself, so that people where trained from childhood to follow the leader. This was true of Rwanda and Germany at the time. \n\nI also see nothing good in being \"loyal\" to a person just because he is born into a family of kings. Norway has a royal family, and actually for pragmatic reasons I am not against it, but for ideological reasons I am a republican.\n\nThe last problem is the modern idea of what is important. All the magic is usually mostly for fighting and healing. Harry Potter actually had lots of other stuff going on, which was real fun. Did you know that many of their ingredients, like Eye of Newt, is actually old names for certain plants? LOL\n\nIf you look the old gods, very important gods were for weather and agriculture and to survive child birth and fertility in general. In our world of Walmarts we forget that food was not always so easily available. (And still isn't, in many countries.)\n\nBy the way, the furniture in Alchemy of Souls must be very clean. Every day a good scrubbing!",

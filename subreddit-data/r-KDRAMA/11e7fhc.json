It was part of his training to learn how to fight like a street fighter for an upcoming role, not some one who trained in a dojo and fought \"pretty\". And the writers handled it really well. That's all I can say without having to add spoilers.\n\nI really recommend this show. For a lot of reasons, but my primary one is that the ML and FL are not forced into the normal rom- com tropes.",

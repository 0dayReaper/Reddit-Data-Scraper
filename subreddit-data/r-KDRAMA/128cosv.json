    "postText": "Hello and welcome to the r/KDRAMA fashion intervention, as we have been notified that some people are having trouble following the latest trend, Summer Jingle Bell Concept. There seems to be some confusion as to how one should dress which should be cleared right up with the following guide.\n\n**Where did the Summer Jingle Bell Concept originate?**\n\nOh, only the best kdrama of all times, *The Heirs*. In order to see the Summer Jingle Bell Concept, watch episode 1 Chan Young &amp; BoNa's introduction scene around the 9 minute mark. If you're unsure as to where you can watch it, please refer to this helpful list of [streaming services.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas/)\n\n**What is this trend about?**\n\nIt really is best to hear it from the trend-setter herself, BoNa:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9g2c552m7ra1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0fa597585e91076e5a94e6b9238bef12c479105e\n\n**This seems simple enough, so any red will do?**\n\nMost definitely not. Dark red is not red and is therefore not in line with the Summer Jingle Bell Concept. See Chan Young's rookie mistake:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfj0npd5m7ra1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=03711aaadfc2e9439e3a4d195b11eafc7c058bb9\n\nConfusing dark red as red has caused many horrible problems by preventing couples who decided to go on a date dressed in a couple outfit according to the Summer Jingle Bell Concept from achieving the highly desired fashionable couple look. Truly a tragedy.\n\nRemember: **Dark red is not red.**\n\nAs wearing dark red invalidates the whole concept of Summer Jingle Bell and probably breaks a few intergalactic rules on kdrama fashion, we have made a few changes to the subreddit's design in order to make everyone understand the difference between red and dark red. One is Summer Jingle Bell Concept red and the other is dark red, only useful as a mango coconut backdrop (the official drink of *The Heirs*).\n\nWe hope that this brief fashion guide has been helpful in making you prevent [crimes against fashion](https://i.redd.it/izjb1wi4g0e41.gif), so you don't end up like Chan Young or we might have to make this an annual event.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, **happy Heirs Day everyone!** It's the best day of the year on r/KDRAMA, when we celebrate the best kdrama ever, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). For one day only (April 1, 2023 00:01 AM - 11:59 PM KST) we'll allow Heirs positive memes and fanart that follows our other DDay rules until the Heirs day loophole closes. Dissing The Heirs may earn you a permanent ban or an influx of Kim Tan memes. Subreddit decorations will stay up for at least a week in order for everyone to truly understand that dark red is not red when following the Summer Jingle Bell Concept.\n\nIf you would like to celebrate with a seasonal flair reply to this post with one of the following phrases (note that capitalization and spacing must be exact for it to work).\n\n**Traditional Heirs Day flair:** comment \"Happy Heirs Day!\"\n\n**To make your flair RED and keep your current flair text:** comment \"Team BoNa\", \"That's Not Red. That's Dark Red!\" or \"Today's Theme is Christmas in Summer\"\n\n**To make your flair DARK RED and keep your current flair text:** comment \"Team Chan Young\" or \"Dark Red is Red\"",

More generally, learn to appreciate the plethora of titles, both new and old, that have already been released. Relying too much on new dramas for your viewing satisfaction is setting yourself up for disappointment, because of the impossible expectations it creates for each new drama. Furthermore, if you\u2019re in a drama slump, the odds that a new release can magically pull you out of that slump where other new releases and already aired dramas could not, seem vanishingly small.",

            "comment": "**Binge, or slow and steady? Choose your own way to watch.** I usually have 2-3 dramas going at the same time. For me it helps to have something to watch that suits different moods. One drama is for watching slowly and another is for binging. I may start binge watching, get to that episode 6-7 lull, then back burner it while I start another one. This helps keep me from dropping dramas. For example, right now I watch an episode of Tomorrow every 3-4 weeks because each episode is mostly self-contained while the suicide subject matter would be a little hard to take all at once. I binged the first few episodes of Lawless Lawyer until the forward momentum of the story stalled in the middle. I am now watching just a couple episodes per week and enjoying it. Meanwhile, I binged the last 8 episodes of The Glory over 3 days. \n\n**Recommendations** I\u2019ve added many dramas to my watch list based on comments on this sub and r/kdramarecommends sub. Sometimes people will recommend something pretty obscure and I can find a hidden gem. Other times I find my tastes are someone\u2019s exact opposite and I\u2019ll look at watching whatever they hated. Reddit is my #1 source for new drama recommendations. \n\n**Mydramalist** I wish I had started a mydramalist in the very beginning; I resisted it for a long time. Now I\u2019m having to go back and add everything I\u2019ve watched and it\u2019s a lot of work. Much better to add as I watch, and the list helps keep me organized. I like all the tags on the listings for the shows; I can follow something like \u201cstrong female\u201d tag and find more shows to add to my watchlist. I also appreciate it when people who ask for suggestions post a link to their lists. It gets irritating when people ask for recommendations but keep putting \u201cI\u2019ve already seen that\u201d comments on every suggestion. Final comment on mydramalist: I wish the site was better, with less of a cheap look and so many popups and ads. \n\n**Upvote** Did you agree with someone\u2019s comment or recommendation? Click the upvote to show your appreciation. It\u2019s nice to do, and very enjoyable on the receiving end. Downvoting is a bummer and I don\u2019t do it on this sub. If I don\u2019t like someone\u2019s opinion I just move on. \n\n**New to kdrama?** Take the time to watch a few classics. It will give you perspective and understanding of the kdrama genre. If you\u2019re on this sub you really need to watch The Heirs, even if chaebol teens and romance are not your thing. This subreddit has a culture of its own and it will be a richer experience if you\u2019ve seen it. (And why do I like Lee Min Ho so much when he\u2019s not even that great as an actor?)\n\n**Streaming services** I\u2019m in the US; my comments are based on that perspective. Viki is my preferred source: it has so much content, the translations are better (and will include notes on cultural context), there are more trailers available, links to cast info are better (if I like an actor/actress I can find other shows they were in). I do wish it had the \u201cskip intro\u201d feature like Netflix. Netflix is my #2 source: good amount of content, easy to search, interface is easy to use; interface is better on iPad versus TV. Prime has less content, interface is annoying, and I\u2019ll only watch something there if it\u2019s not available elsewhere (Dinner Mates). I\u2019m trying Hulu this week and already know I won\u2019t continue with it. \n\n**Mix it up** I find I\u2019m more likely to get bored with a drama if I\u2019ve watched too many of the same type in a row. Rich chaebol male/poor but spunky female romance gets dull so I\u2019ll switch to a detective or legal drama. When I don\u2019t know what to watch next or feel stuck I\u2019ll watch a movie instead of a drama; that can break me out of a rut. \n\n**Get outside** Kdrama is more enjoyable when I feel good and healthy. Put the drama down and go for a walk, then come back to it.",

Usually that's about 20 minutes before the end of the episode, but you can kind of feel it, because the initial arc of the episode has some kind of resolution before the next stage in the narrative. Stop at that lull in between, or you will get trapped into another full episode! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI like to save the last two episodes to watch together. So if I don't have time for both, I won't start. If the last one hasn't aired... I don't know. If I am enjoyed the anticipation, then sure, I'll watch it. Usually though, I have it set up to watch the last two at once.\n\nI tend to follow an actor's work. I will watch a few shows from an actor, and then be drawn to another actor from there, and so on. This leads me to some genres I wouldn't normally choose at times, but I like how that expends my exposure to various kinds of shows. For instance, when I was following Ji Chang Wook, I ended up watching Smile Again, which is a daytime show I otherwise would NEVER have seen (I don't know if it aired during daytime, but it had that feel).",

I don\u2019t think it was the best idea to start season two right after season one, because I didn\u2019t really get to properly process the season one finale (I was a crying mess). It also made the shift in actresses a bit more stark. I think it would have been better to at least wait a few days before jumping into season two.\n\nI really like watching 2-3 dramas at once. Usually one is fantasy (finished Alchemy of Souls and have now begun The King: Eternal monarch) which can be pretty heavy and then having a slice of life/ romance drama to watch on the side (right now I\u2019m watching Our Beloved Summer). I don\u2019t really have a criteria for the third one, it\u2019s typically just a new drama I\u2019m excited to watch (The Glory).

I was tryna schedule time to watch everything but it was just not working \ud83d\ude2d in reality, I\u2019m a student and there\u2019s no way I can watch more than a 3-4 dramas at a time and that\u2019s generous. In a more busy semester I\u2019ll be lucky if I can even keep up with 1 lol. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t make it a mission to watch everything  or feel bad for falling behind. I\u2019m busy and my dramas will always be there so it\u2019s ok to go hang out with friends, study!!!, attend events, etc. I\u2019m moving at my own pace and it helps with not feeling burnt out!! I\u2019ve improved a lot with that this year \n\nAlso, **I watch what I want, hype or no hype!! In the past I would watch some hyped dramas trying to follow the crowd and then sometimes be disappointed. It\u2019s important to know what you like. If a hyped show is a horror or a super intense thriller, there\u2019s no need for me to watch it because I know I don\u2019t like those genres. That was my dilemma with the Glory because everyone loved it but would I really like the gore?? Maybe not \ud83e\udd74 the drama experience is also better when you\u2019re picking shows according to your interests and not everyone else\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019ve made a priority drama list because there are plenty of dramas on my ptw that it felt overbearing. This list has about 40 dramas on it and I\u2019m slowly chipping away at it. During the school year I tend to focus on ongoing dramas because I can only watch the released episodes lol \ud83d\ude02 during breaks though I add on completed dramas!\n\nFinally, drop that drama!! I used to struggle with dropping but don\u2019t waste your precious time on a drama you don\u2019t like. If anything you can always revisit it later.",

I have run a search for SK shows in the romance+comedy category on Netflix as a sample - [MDL search](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;ty=68&amp;co=3&amp;ge=17,19&amp;sr=5&amp;st=3&amp;so=top), pick and try!",

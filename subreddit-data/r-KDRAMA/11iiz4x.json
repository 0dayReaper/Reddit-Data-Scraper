            "comment": "**My Liberation Notes**\n\n* **Good Things**: The performances are excellent across the board. The soundtrack is suitably mellow and reflective. But what I love the most about this drama is how natural and unglamorous it is. The scenes of the family working silently in the fields of Sanpo on a humid summer afternoon felt like an authentic, even documentary-esque depiction of countryside life in South Korea. \n* **Bad Things**: I can understand why some viewers might have felt disappointed with the way the series wrapped up after the &gt;!time skip!&lt;. While there were one or two jarring changes in the intervening period, in other respects, the subsequent episodes proved the old adage that \"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\"\n* **Interesting Things**: The insights into the workplace culture in several industries and the experience of people commuting to a major city from the countryside were fascinating.\n* **Spotlight On Because**: When a drama in the slice-of-life genre is done as well as this one is, it sets a standard of excellence that is difficult to surpass.",

Given the rise in \"layoffs\" by many tech giants, this drama just makes more sense now.\n\n**Spotlight On Because**: This is a very underrated drama. Even during its airing, it barely made any huge noise. But for me, it's one of the most realistic kdramas I've ever watched along with Misaeng. This drama deserves more recognition.",

So unfair.",

            "comment": "**Live** (2018) (Police/Slice of Life/Drama): A look at the daily lives and duties of police officers in South Korea. Deals with heavy issues, but a solid character piece sympathetic to both law enforcement and citizenry. TW: &gt;!domestic violence, sexual assault!&lt;\n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The day-to-day drudgery. There's no serial killer cat-and-mouse or genius detectives. Police work is everything from dealing with drunks to navigating departmental politics to filling out paperwork to high profile cases and it's all treated with the same gravitas.\n* The ensemble characters. You'll love them/hate them or love-to-hate/hate-to-love them, but they all have reasons for the way they act and interact with each other and their conflicts and hang-ups stem from more relatable issues than Kdrama tropes. \n* The unflinching realism. There's no easy answer to systemic societal problems, and the narrative doesn't pretend to have any. Sometimes people make bad choices, sometimes they make good choices and sometimes there aren't any choices at all; just consequences.\n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The hierarchy/work culture. Tough to watch and crosses the line into what could be considered abuse at points; depending on how sensitive you are to the issue it might make it drop worthy.\n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The rookie romance. It's fine, but it's something that could have been omitted without changing anything important; which is usually a sign that something should have been omitted.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* Noh Hee Kyung also wrote **It's Okay That's Love** (2014), **Dear My Friends** (2016) and **Our Blues** (2022). \n\n**Spotlight on Because:**\n\n* It's one of the best depictions of broken people in a broken system trying to help each other in a Kdrama, and IMO is equal to **My Mister** and **Misaeng** in that regard.\n\nIt's a 9/10 from me. Recommended if you like stark but sympathetic slice of life like **Black Dog** / **Misaeng** / **My Mister**, realistic character-driven crime dramas like **Through the Darkness** and don't mind stories that are hopeful but not necessarily feel good.",

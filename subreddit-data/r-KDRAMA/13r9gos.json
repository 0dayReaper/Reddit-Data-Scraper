KJU and Krystal are surprisingly funny together but the show also has some very touching moments, particularly as the ML\u2019s backstory is revealed. Crazy Love gets off to a bit of a slow start but it keeps getting better and better, even after the halfway point, although the last few eps focus more on finding the culprits and less on their romance.",

            "comment": "Not a drama but I've recently watched the movies [A Taxi Driver](https://mydramalist.com/17009-a-taxi-driver) and [1987: When the Day Comes](https://mydramalist.com/21985-1987) which are both relevant to the move from martial law to democratization for South Korea.\n\nI actually kind of didn't really like A Taxi Driver because the amount of information it provides me is too low, which is precisely what its designed for: what it was like for people who had no real idea why the hell they had to deal with what they were. Since the only real reason I watch this type of movie is for some level of historical awareness (having lost too much memory of the Korean language to read the actual history books effectively) it kind of felt more like it was made to just appeal to emotion than really tell me what actually happened, and is meant more to just be *a movie* than anything else.\n\nIf it wasn't for parallels I can make between this and how Afro-Americans fear and avoid the police in the United States I'm not sure if I would have even believed in it, to some level I can just feel like its omitting any information that might muddle a clear perception of what happened.\n\nAlthough 1987 also doesn't tell me too much about why anything happens, I appreciated it a lot more for how much it emphasizes on the variety of people involved. In A Taxi Driver you really only are selectively shown soldiers, taxi drivers, and university victims.\nIn 1987 you have students, prosecutors, prison guards, priests, buddhist monks, children, shop owners, a divide between reporters who want to get shit done and those trying to save their own asses, antagonists in regret threatening to sell out their own, antagonists with traumatic resolve for a twisted sense of patriotism, and the active efforts to covertly achieve either a public revelation or stomping out any opposition they can sniff out.\n\nIt really makes you feel like situation concerns the entire nation, rather than anything someone can afford to be ignorant about, which at least paints South Koreans as a people who were willing to fight for a fair society over being a bunch of victims who have no one but foreigners to rely on. I think that last bit is really why I liked 1987 a lot better as both a piece to give me historical background and also as an engaging movie, even if it lacks international appeal due to being heavier on context than A Taxi Driver. I'm quite familiar with people acting like foreign nations' people lack the agency to even take care of themselves, so.\n\nOn the subject of this era, apparently that drama Snowdrop actually aired..? I can only remember people trying to cancel it for historical distortion that favors the idea of North Korean spies having been an actual thing rather than just an excuse for the dictatorship, and considering a significant number of people of the time period are still alive you can actually count on people knowing what they're talking about when they see something as malicious revisionism.",

If they pay highly for them, then producers/stations might go to them, instead of platforms like Viki getting to share them, and this might happen more and more. I hope it doesn't, though. Another reason is that Netflix can then dominate what gets produced, and influence the type of content, including themes, mores, and so on. This might mean americanising it, or increasing representation of particular themes they want to promote - changing the character of Korean series that are offered overseas. It's probably unlikely to make a big difference in that way, but certainly possible. \n\nThis is in addition to the potential positive consequences, of course.",

It was like they just took their time, saying goodbye, tying up loose ends, trying on shades of happiness and unhappiness, comedy and tragedy, for the different character arcs.\n\nOh, I really enjoyed the part where some of the characters jokingly act out a scene from **Signal**!  So, if anyone is looking for a Challenge drama that is referenced in another drama, **TKEM** gives you a reason to watch **Signal**, if you haven\u2019t already seen it.",

The first episode was passable in other ways but the CGI stuff was quite terrible. I presume the drama will largely take place in the mountain/outdoor setting - if that's the case and its gonna be more of such poor CGI all through then I'd rather drop, despite the cast. Would like to hear from anyone who's finished the drama please.",

It kept leading and leading up to something big, but when it got there, it wasn't as big as expected. I mean, it was a revelation, and the mystery was done pretty well, but the resolution of these two characters' stories wasn't satisfying. The ending was weird and underwhelming. I found myself wondering what I'd just spent all that time and anxious feelings watching. \n\nSo it depends, as usual, on what you're watching it for. I don't remember the special effects being poor, but I probably wasn't focused on them. It was more the story that I was semi-unhappy about. It had both good and not-great elements.",

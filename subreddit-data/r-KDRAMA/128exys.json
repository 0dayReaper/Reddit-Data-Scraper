This year's theme is **Christmas in Summer Time** (or as my fellow southern hemisphere people know it, Christmas).\n\n**The subreddit is best viewed in all it's Heirs Day glory on new reddit.** \n\nFor one day only (April 1, 2023 00:01 AM - 11:59 PM KST) we'll allow Heirs positive memes and fanart that follows our other DDay rules until the Heirs day loophole closes. Dissing The Heirs may earn you a permanent ban or an influx of Kim Tan memes. Subreddit decorations will stay up for at least a week.\n\nCheck out u/AlohaAlex's post, [The Official Summer Jingle Bell Concept Guide to What Is Red](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/128cosv/the_official_summer_jingle_bell_concept_guide_to/) then join us in a game of red or dark red. While you are there you can get yourself a complementary Heirs day user flair. \n\n**How to play**: Flip through the pictures and check out the label below, then join the debate in the comments as to whether the objects in the pictures are red, dark red or the mods are completely crazy after watching ***The Heirs*** for the millionth time. You may use spoiler tags to cover your answers e.g. 1. &gt;!TOTALLY RED!&lt;",

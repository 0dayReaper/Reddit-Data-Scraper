I know people, Americans particularly, have a problem with subtitles. But for most of the world that\u2019s consumed English content through subs (or bad dubs) I think we got pretty familiar and comfortable with it.\n\nOnce people realize that kdramas are just Korean tv shows that have genres galore that anyone can get into, they\u2019ll be even more embraced. The problem is that many still hear \u201ckdrama\u201d and think its just one specific genre. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s just the language of the content produced by South Korea.",

So for them, it\u2019s not the subs, they just think it\u2019s all overly dramatic and sometimes cheesy. They don\u2019t usually like the scripts or direction either. Thats obviously just their personal preference. \nI think what you said about subs being hard for English speakers to get used to makes sense for a lot of people though! And your other points too.",

I\u2019m not fangirling on my own into thin air anymore(apart from here haha), and it\u2019s so great discussing the shows with others, plus sharing the same emotional connection and laughs at hilarious moments.",

But they just hear \u201ckdrama\u201d and laugh it off and judged. \nEventually I just made up my mind. This piece of heaven should only be shared to the worthy :P I don\u2019t want ppl to watch it half heartedly and not appreciate the beauty.",

I have been trying to get mine to watch as well but she keeps saying how its not Americanized enough like dude because they're S Korean? thats why its different! Then she keeps saying how most dramas is too cliche or sad even though I recommended the more different ones not even about love. Oh well!",

I was dying to discuss a show and/or find out how other people reacted to specific episodes and found this group!",

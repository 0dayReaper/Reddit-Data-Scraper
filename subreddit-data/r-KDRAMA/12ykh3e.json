            "comment": "I've always thought about how TVN kept airing dramas they knew might not have good viewership potential in the Wed-Thurs time slot and threw all their dramas with high success potential into the weekend time slot (with the exception of Pandora airing right now which broke their over 1 year streak of having successful ratings for weekend dramas). This strategy may make sense given more people have time to watch dramas on the weekend, but it's just not a good use of resources if they want to maximize viewership.\n\nAt least JTBC still has their Wed-Thurs time slot which they resumed in 2020, and looking forward to The Good Bad Mother airing this week!",

It premiered at around 4-5% and is now hovering in the 3-4% mark on average, compared to CCIR which ended up with double digit ratings.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, people didn't like how the writing/plot was all over the place and probably the over the top plot lines, but I love makjang so I can't relate to that. I kept thinking they should have aired this on SBS as I saw Lee Ji Ah and Lee Sang Yoon previously in SBS dramas like Penthouse and One the Woman.",

This drama was amazing and ended up with 11% by the finale, I really enjoyed Kim Go Eun's acting. Other than that, maybe the 2021 drama named Mine that also aired in the weekend time slot on TVN is considered a makjang, but it had the great Lee Bo Young and Kim Seo Hyung which made the drama more enjoyable.",

They've had some pretty popular dramas in the Wed-Thu slot, including Tale of the Nine-Tailed which was successful enough to be renewed for more seasons. I'm wondering if the time of year also makes a difference and whether they plan to put dramas in the Wed-Thu slot during busier seasons, and then variety shows when it's slower or there's more competition.",

Hospital playlist\u2019s quality is actually quite a feat given it was filmed during the height of Covid, plans kept constantly changing and they had to change locations as well. A third season (likely) would have been the best one yet. And given ratings for season 2 averaged higher than season 1, a possibility of 20% for a third season wouldn\u2019t be far fetched at all.",

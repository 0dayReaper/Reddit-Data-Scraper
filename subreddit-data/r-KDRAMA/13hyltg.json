I like how everyone has just decided to overlook this very important fact. I understand Hong-ju's shock and anger, but the way she spoke to Shi-yeol was too much for me. Same goes for Jang.",

I honestly LOVE the main couple and have been feeling frustrated at the amount of time given to the second couple who (for me) alternate between being bland and needlessly angsty. \n\nLike I love Shi Yeol and am 100% done with everyone trying to act like he\u2019s a monster, so I have my fingers crossed that nonsense ends tomorrow\u2026 but oh my GOD, I could not be less interested in the plot line that clearly exists only to give angst to his romance with a woman who has no personality and clearly has no sense either (does she not understand what a bodyguard is? was she not engaged to a dude whose job involved fighting/killing people as his king/commanding officers directed?). \n\nI just want to see shenanigans like we\u2019ve got going on with main couple right now (she\u2019s in disguise getting shit done, he\u2019s about to throw off the disguise to do the same). It feels like so much time has been wasted that I\u2019m very ???? we\u2019re at the end tomorrow??? That said, I cannot wait for my main guy to &gt;!rescue his brother with the aid of my main girl and their merry band of heroes, kill the king, and get his crown, crown his queen!&lt; and live happily ever after!",

Yeah I can agree that the on screen chemistry between the lead couple wasn\u2019t as great as people wanted, the weren\u2019t horrible but I enjoyed the 2nd couple better though. The FL I feel like was just out of her element, making this her first go round with a period piece. Also her recent roles before this were more \u201ccolder\u201d characters (the glory and revenge of others). \n\nGlad this show didn\u2019t have an ending like My Country. I was like \u201cPlease don\u2019t let Shi Yeol die, my boy needs to live happily ever after with Hong Joo!!\u201d",

And I'm glad Hae Mi called Leo.\n\nHave to admit that when  Je Hyeok was being kicked while he was down&gt;! I actually sort of understood his comment that he wants to have the power and be above those who looked down on him.  And now we see the murder is self defense.  An interesting turn.!&lt;\n\nAm I the only one yelling at the screen every time Je Hyeok manages to come out on top - YOU'LL GET  YOURS!  or similar.  \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe fashion on this is killer. KSA is, as befits a lawyer and politician, subdued while OYA is a fun over the top.  That pearl encrusted jacket was amazing.\n\nDefinitely so good and can't wait for our couple to finally go beyond a hug.  C'mon.  These are mature adults.",

Can they atleast beat him at one thing? !&lt;I hope this isn't one of those dramas where the villan wins up until the very last episode.. ( which is pretty much all kdramas)\n\nKang Hoo still seems to be one of the decent people on the show... thankfully! And I hope that student he ran into reaches out to him.&gt;! I want to know what happened to the poor girl. Hoping she was not assaulted or anything of that sort but she did seem petrified. I wonder if she witnessed something? Also, now that we know the children are put to work with the angel club with button cameras... I;m wondering what that small little girl had on the bottom of her dress? Is it another camera from someone else???!&lt;\n\nYoo Jung.... as sad as it is I hope she wakes up soon about her husband. Or will she be one of those defend til I die type... I seriously hope that's not the case.",

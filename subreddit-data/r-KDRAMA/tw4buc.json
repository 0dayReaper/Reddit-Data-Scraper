Hell it didn't even have to be any elaborate or definitive, just the hope and seeing an older Yijin... \n\nInstead its like the writer/director was like \"Yea. We can't save this... Let's just show some clips of what people liked from when the show was funny/heartwarming\"",

He couldn't give her what she needed in a relationship anymore - his career was important to him so it was important to her too and she couldn't ask him to quit.\n \nFrom the very beginning we knew that the life she lived with her mother in the same career was very painful and lonely for Hee Do, so she couldn't choose that for her life either.  She could have stuck it out, but it would have meant a commitment to more of the loneliness she grew up with. I loved them together, but their ending was raw and so real for two people desperately in love but just not compatible with the goals they have set in life. They were able to realize their incompatibility before they were filing for divorce. \n\nMy only minor beef is the sadness that Hee Do must have held onto thinking he believed the words of their breakup instead of what she wanted to tell him and wrote in her diary. He had the full story, but it took 20 years for her to know that he also had the whole picture of their breakup - he could have mailed the diary to her or to her coach - she hadn't gone to the comic shop in a long time.",

When Yi Jin told her he got the job in NY the first thing she said was that it was a great news, she always held back her true emotions because she wanted the best for him and his career until she just finally snapped. That's why she said there isn't anyone to blame, they just don't work. Justifying the break-up because of the emotional state they were in is enough imo. They were both very emotionally tired, and it didn't seem worth it anymore to Hee Do. She's tired of not being seen as an equal who can take on his burden in Yi Jin's eyes and this is has always been the problem of their relationship even before they started dating. He's always wanted to protect her but ironically it ended up pushing her farther away.",

I don't even mind that they didn't end up together but as much as the writers tried to portray their separation as being realistic, it was anything but when it comes to their character. To me, they were more of an emotional support for each other than lovers. Both BYJ and NHD failed at communicating to each other of their worries and simply didn't work at fixing anything which is completely out of character for both of them, considering the lengths they would go for each other and themselves in earlier episodes. I just couldn't understand why both of them failed to communicate and try and remedy the situation despite both of them alluding to already knowing their relationship was in jeopardy. There was only toleration and not enough resolution, hell forget resolution there wasn't enough effort at all.\n\nI can still say confidently I love this drama but it's a pity that the ending feels unpolished and lazy, as if the writers set up something too grand but realized there was a dead-end and had no idea how to back out. All the hints and clues scattered across the episodes were wasted, too many questions unanswered and sometimes they don't need to be answered but in this case it was only setting themselves up for failure. But you know what? That's life. There isn't always an answer and that's going to be my outlook on this drama now.",

We have to keep in mind that the story is heavily skewed towards Heedo because the it's told through her diary. Most of what we saw of Yijin is through Heedo's lenses since the very beginning. They used to have great communication which is why we got to see his struggles, but after they drifted we mostly started seeing Heedo's side of the story. We didn't see much of his side at the end.\n\nI'd have to disgree that Yijin is the one who doesn't see Heedo beside her, but it's the other way around. After experiencing her mom's absence, Heedo knows that she needs someone that be more present in her life. Yijiin's work wouldn't allow that, so she decided to let him go. Her decision is understandable and even commendable since she knows what she wants in her life.\n\nOn the other hand, Yijin was willing to work things out again and even asked her if they're doing the right thing by breaking up. Yijin tried to hold on till the end but he also knows how firm Heedo is with her decision so he let her go. \n\nI would've been happy with Heedo's decision if she seems content with her current marriage. But the shop being named 2521, the rainbow chairs, her car being red and her implied divorce just alludes that she's not really over Yijin. It just hurts to see both of them this way, knowing they could've worked things out and still be in each other's life since their foundation was so strong.",

The feelings they had for each other were pure, deep, profound from the beginning, they didn't know any \"half-assed love\", hence when they really encountered the fade in the feelings due to the real, difficult life circumstances, they didn't realize that what they had was still bigger than what some people live with every day their whole lives. Compared to the love they knew for each other before, it was too unremarkable, hence they let it go, at least Hee Do did. \n\nIn reality it's the timing problem, both had very successful careers and were in the time in their lives where they couldn't sacrifice that. If they met at 30 years old, they would've been great together and very real. On the other hand, Yi Jin probably could've not survived his difficult times in the beginning has he not met Hee Do, to that extent of success. Maybe Hee Do too, would've had slower growth. \n\nBut why they didn't get back together later is a mystery to me, it doesn't look like Hee Do has great love with Min Chae's father, she retired at 29, her schedule was free finally, and Yi Jin was back in Korea already, she didn't even have to go to NY for him. This is just lazy writing, considering that they were orginating from the story of Jaurim singer, Kim Yu Na, where he ex died in reality, they probably couldn't tie it up to the Drama's storyline in a realistic way.",

But after the last episode ended, for the first time in more than 10 years, I went to look at some correspondence from a long distance relationship I\u2019d had, that had broken down due largely to the distance\n\nIt was interesting to note how many times we missed each other time-wise (the time zone difference was similar to what Hee Do and Yi Jin would have faced). And how it emotionally affected us both, with a lot of misunderstandings. There\u2019s such limited information you have and so much going on that you can never update sufficiently\n\nAnd so, while some feel that the breakdown of the relationship wasn\u2019t spelled out enough, I definitely can see the dynamics from what they\u2019ve shown, and can accept what happened\n\nI did very much enjoy a lot of the drama \n\nI do feel that the writer and director deliberately toyed with us though, as a tactic to keep the audience engaged",

Being able to convey the stories of others and helping the world to learn of travesties is something he believes can make the world a better place. \n\nOn a more professional perspective, being a New York correspondent at such an early stage of his career meant that he would jumpstart his progression to climbing the ranks of eventually becoming an anchor. (This would eventually aid him in achieving his goal of becoming like Hee-do\u2019s mum and reuniting his family).\n\nWith that being said, he achieved what he set out to do. But at what cost? \n\nI sometimes wonder what would be the \u201cright\u201d choice to make in such circumstances.",

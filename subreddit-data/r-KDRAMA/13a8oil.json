            "comment": "1. **My Mister** \\- Still, to date, the best drama I've ever watched. One of those shows that stays with you for a long time; I think it genuinely changed (at least for a week) how I thought about failure, human connection, and life. \n\n2. **Mother** \\- Another show about strong emotional connections, focused on motherhood. Criminally underrated drama, and almost as good as My Mister. Only slightly below My Mister because I thought the ending dragged a little.\n\n3. **Twenty Five, Twenty One** \\- I hated the ending at first, but the more I think about it the more I like it. A happy ending would've been incredibly contrived and nowhere near as emotionally powerful. There were plenty of warning signs for it, the seeds for their break up were there all along now that I think about it, and honestly it makes the rest of drama that much more beautiful in retrospect. I actually felt empty inside for the next 2 days. What a great show.\n\n4. **Flower of Evil** \\- Honestly this is a tough drama to rank for me because it has much clearer flaws than most of the others in my top-10. (I didn't particularly enjoy the beginning or (especially) the end, and I thought the ML's characterization was inconsistent.) It's still ranked this high because the middle half of it - episodes 4-12 - were some of the most captivating television I've watched. Incredibly powerful romance, and it kept me at the edge of my seat.\n\n5. **Red Sleeve** \\- I'm not a huge fan of historical dramas, but this was incredible. I loved how grey every character in the show was beside the FL, and I liked how they didn't gloss over the power dynamic between a king and his palace maid. The drama was also refreshingly free palace of cliche palace politics (seriously, every other historical drama I've watched has some beard-twiddling state secretary plotting a coup against the king. It gets old, fast.) \n\n6. **SKY Castle** \\- As someone who grew up in a very competitive school district where people were obsessed with college admissions, this show was pretty relatable to me. (No one I knew was quite *that* extreme, though.) Very entertaining throughout and pretty gut-punching toward the end.\n\n7. **CLOY** \\- This was my second-ever Kdrama, and never in a million years did I expect to like it as much as I did. It's kinda silly at times, but it has a lot of heart, and I really enjoyed the world-building they did in NK. It was very entertaining, and SYJ is a fantastic, captivating actress.\n\n8. **Move to Heaven** \\- Has a ton of heart, the relationship between the ML and his uncle is very captivating, and it's enjoyable throughout. In terms of objective quality I think this would be higher on the list, but it didn't connect with me as much emotionally as the others on this list.\n\n9. **The Glory**. I think this drama would've been more enjoyable without the pause between parts 1 and 2. Very satisfying revenge story, and had an interesting mysterious vibe to it. Also loved how the bullies essentially unravel their own lives.\n\n10. **Hot Stove League** \\- IMO this is an office-drama done right, and to me it felt like a more entertaining version of Misaeng. I would rank this higher than say, FoE, if I were wearing my critic hat, but it didn't have the same level of emotional connection for me.\n\nHonorable mentions: DP, BTIMFL, Reply 1988, Little Women.",

I liked Signal but I didn't get the hype because I found most of the characters deeply annoying. I enjoyed Stranger and Good Detective more for 'serious crime/cop dramas.' I also am still not sure if I liked the time-loop resolution of Signal, maybe I should watch it again and decide but something didn't quite work for me. I will forever pitch the chinese drama Reset as the most genius timeloop show ever.  \n\n\nI also thought Vincenzo and Healer were **mid** shows, the chemistry in Healer was no joke but I found some of the action/mystery sequences laughable and Vincenzo was somewhat ruined by the extended Very Bad Comedy Sequences of the neighbours which only improved/made sense by the end. For the same writer I highly recommend Chief Kim imo a dramatically superior show with similar charms but none of the obvious drawbacks (stupid screwball comedy, overstays its welcome, etc).",

Outside of healer, true beauty and maybe good manager, I don\u2019t agree with the list either, but I figured maybe they were newish to dramas .",

Youth of May\\* and Rookie Historian both period shows... there are some commonalities.\n\nI actually don't consider Happiness a 'zombie show' at all as the 'zombie' bit is basically entirely allegorical, so I wouldn't class Kingdom and Happiness as the same genre if I were asked, and I hate zombie shows but would probably put Happiness on my top 10 list because it's so different from others and usually what's really different sticks with you more (at least it does for me). Normally if I'm making a best-of list I'm thinking 'best of Romcom, best of Thriller, etc...'",

Stranger- First kdrama I watched because I really wanted to watch a thriller but had exhausted all the good English-language options on Netflix.\n\n2. My Mister- First slow burn I watched. Any drama/series/movie that values realism in terms of how characters talk or the (lack of) background score gets high marks from me. \n\n3. Little Women\n\n4. Vincenzo- The premise is bonkers obviously (a Korean being accepted into the Sicilian Mafia who, in real life, don\u2019t even let non-Sicilian Italians join lol) but it\u2019s good enough for me to exercise my suspension of disbelief \n\n5. D.P. \n\n6. The Glory \n\n7. My Liberation Notes \n\n8. Gaus Electronics \n\n9. Business Proposal- I think I\u2019m in the minority on this sub when I say I don\u2019t like most romcom kdramas. Maybe it\u2019s the repeated \u201crich guy-poor girl\u201d story or the goofy side characters with over the top acting or the background scores playing in every scene. This one was different though. I think it helped that, from the trailer, it made no secret of being a silly comedy with romance. I instantly became a fan of all four of the main cast \n\n10. Interest of Love- You\u2019ve probably realized by now that I love slow burns lol",

In fact I forgot Zombie Detective even existed until I saw your list, but I absolutely ADORED that show and I feel like no one really discusses it.  \n\n\nLike I too would put Tunnel above Signal although Signal was more hyped, but sometimes it feels like either older shows or OCN shows in particular (for crime genre) just got slept on because they weren't on the 'trendy' networks at the peak time that international viewers were paying attention. A lot of things that are on everyone's lists were fine for me but didn't have the magical appeal they seemed to have for other people (notably goblin, CLOY, etc) while I think some of my fav shows are the ones it feels like NO ONE watched or discusses!",

However if I had to watch it now for the first time, I would probably have dropped it lol. \n\nI've always wanted to watch a signal, but I keep on putting it off, I'll add to my list again. \n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the zombie detective. The leads were fantastic here, and not only was the show entertaining, it was hilarious, but people were nitpicking the plot and everything else. \n\nCan you copy and paste your list for me here.Sorry, I'm too lazy to scroll \ud83e\udee0",

            "comment": "1. My Liberation Notes - It's a slow burn,introspective,poetic drama that made me cry hard about my own life and fall for the King of my fangirl heart, Son Suk ku. It's slice of life done perfect. If you like the airy,melodramatic feeling that a lot of Japanese movies go for,you'd love this.\n\n2. World of The Married - A successful doctor gets cheated on. Nothing original yes but its incredibly engaging and shot beautifully. Best 1st episode of any drama I've seen and I've seen hundreds. The acting is seriously top tier. It's visceral but you won't be left exhausted when it ends. \n\n3. D.P. - War is hell and so is military service. This drama is dark in subject matter and visuals. I work with veteran medical records and get to hear their horror stories on a daily basis. Because of this,it took me longer to finish the show but I'm so glad I did. It's more cinematic than your average kdrama and demands your attention even if you're hesitant about the subject matter. Needless to say,Jung Hae In is a damn good actor.\n\n4. Stranger - Powerful people being corrupt is my jam. Throw in a heroic male/female duo with a platonic relationship and I'm completely sold. It's a cerebral crime drama that felt like a puzzle. The second season is also great.\n\n5. Life - A medical drama with the beautiful Lee Dong Wook as a tragic physician. I still have attachments to my old job so I watched it. The main plot explores the struggle between profit and humanity. Tosses fluff aside and leans heavy into the realistic. \n\n6. SKY Castle- Another trope I absolutely adore is rich moms who will do anything for their kids' education. Its messy and I love mess. I wanted to live in all of their houses. Especially the author's home. This drama adds in the makjang whenever it can without being too cartoonish. The ending had a few \"hey wait a minute\" issues but overall I liked it alot.\n\n7. Little Women - Little ladies against the ever blooming world of the Elite. One of the most recent dramas I watched that made it to my Top 10. If it weren't for the last couple of episodes,I would've placed this show much higher. It also starts a bit slow. That being said, simply the most beautiful looking drama. Period. Characters with personality that you can tell apart. And the music? Atmospheric. Gorgeous. Give me a ton of money and a man like Mr. Choi, I'm moving to Singapore.\n\n8. Be Melodramatic - The main character is a drama writer whose friends work in similar fields. The only light hearted drama on my list. This show is like My Liberation Notes' not as smart but much happier older sister. I didn't cry as much watching this show but I definitely laughed more. You really get to see the BTS of how dramas are created which is a cool concept.\n\n9. Money Game - Powerful people wanting more and getting their hands dirty. That's it. That's the show. It's political, historical (the financial crisis of 97') and brainy. No true romance or fluff. No one is flashy or super comedic. The tone is darker than Life but heavy in realism. Looking back most people found this show rather boring. One hell of a first episode and a great OST.\n\n10. Reflection of You - My most recent watch. Do you like pain? Do you like getting pissed off? Then this is the show for you. A revenge story where every character is either infuriating,an asshole,insane or all of the above. I placed it on the list not cause its the greatest story ever told but how much it depressed me. The acting is wonderful and the cinematography is perfectly gloomy. I went outside and tolled in my garden for over an hour and still felt like crap. The ending was absolutely wonderful in terms of writing but like I said in a previous post,I'm not rewatching this show \ud83d\ude2d",

I wasn\u2019t a Fan of either of the leads previously - only had Something in the Rain and Memories of Alihambra for reference, but I soon changed my tune. \n\nDoctor Romantic - I do like medical dramas to start with but the regional setting and character focus makes this an all time favourite. \n\nSignal - for me, this is the benchmark against which all other crime dramas are measured. \n\nStrong Woman DBS - sweet funny leads with great chemistry. \n\nTaxi Driver - full disclosure, I started watching this because I\u2019d watch Lee Ji Hoon mowing a lawn, but became fully invested after about 20 mins and binged it immediately. \n\nVincenzo - barely a fault to be had. The entire cast was brilliant and the production quality was tight. Loved the mix of drama and comedy. \n\nExtraordinary You - this was so sweet and such a novel concept for me. \n\nKorean Odyssey - another early watch, this is a favourite I watch again and again, and notice new things every time. \n\nYou are My Destiny - this is the first k-drama I ever saw and the chemistry between the leads is just off the charts. \n\nHonourable mentions for Hospital Playlist, DOTS, Love in the Moonlight, Good Manager, Black, Mystic Pop-up Bar, and Fiery Priest. \n\nI\u2019ve not seen many of the shows that others have listed, but they are pretty much all on my to-watch list. \nI\u2019ve just started watching both Goblin and Mr Queen, so it will be interesting to see if either can knock a show out of my current top ten\u2026",

            "comment": "1- True Beauty: I\u2019ve seen this drama in its entirety three times. This was one of the first k dramas I watched and loved how they weaved teenage angst and romance in with complex family dynamics and suicide. It was light-hearted and funny but also heavy. This also gave me the worst second-lead syndrome, I will forever love Han Seo Jun. This drama is everything I wish we could produce in the US, but we don\u2019t. \n\n2- Reply 1988: I\u2019ve never felt a total part of a community like this drama makes you feel. I loved how it depicted flaws in every character, but also showed how we seem to love our loved ones despite these flaws. It also had a very true love triangle and ending it &gt;!with Taek as the romantic victor seemed a bit strange to me because I thought Duk-Sun would end up with Jung-Hwan.!&lt; I was pleased to hear there is an intense debate about this. The drama really is so much more than Duk-Sun\u2019s love life, I fell in love with all of the characters. \n\n3- Reborn Rich: From start to finish, this drama delivers an action-packed ride through Korean history in what felt like a dramatization of Hyundai or Samsung. The writing, acting, and directing on this drama is the best of the best. This drama was so clever, but I love business heavy dramas. This one juxtaposed the chaebol with the Everyman in a way that allowed for the viewer to make their own decision on the complexity of society and flawed human nature. \n\n4- 25/21: I watched this all in one sitting and I still feel destroyed by it. Because my intense feelings have lingered so long, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s one of the best. My one criticism is the casting and portrayal of older Hee-Do- she wasn\u2019t even a shadow of the younger character which is a big part of what made the ending so hard to swallow. \n\n5- Alchemy of Souls Parts 1&amp;2: This one was so extremely well-done, I couldn\u2019t stop watching and pulled an all-nighter at the end of part 2. I still don\u2019t know how they replaced the FL from 1 to 2 and I was totally fine with it. Besides the great story and fight scenes and the character of Jang Uk, as a viewer I could tell how chummy the cast was in real life. I think it\u2019s rare to see a cast with this kind of chemistry. \n\n6- Vincenzo: I\u2019ve seen this twice and it was great both times. Sometimes when I rewatch a drama the magic is lost, but this one still packed it\u2019s punch. It\u2019s evil fighting evil and who doesn\u2019t love vigilante justice? I\u2019m a massive fan of Song Joong-Ki but I was surprised how TaekYeon blew me away. This is the drama I recommend to friends who haven\u2019t seen k dramas. \n\n7- I Am Not a Robot: This premise was so original and well-executed. I think Yoo Seung-Ho (the ML) is underrated as an actor and his performance in this showed a vulnerability that was palpable. This one gave me the feels and still does when I think about it.\n\n8- The Smile Has Left Your Eyes: I just didn\u2019t see anything coming in this one and I think it\u2019s Seo In-Guk\u2019s best work. I still can\u2019t believe what they had happen but I loved it. \n\n9- Oh My Ghost: Again, another original premise that could only work in a k drama. Park Bo-Young\u2019s (the FL) acting in this one was phenomenal. I also loved the camaraderie of the kitchen staff in the restaurant and the way they tied in the past with the present. The ending had my least-favorite k drama trope &gt;!of time separation,!&lt; but I still loved it. \n\n10- Itaewon Class: I love Park Seo-Jun (raise your hand if you\u2019re also worried about his terrible wig in Captain Marvel) and I loved this business heavy drama. This is another one where the ensemble had chemistry together and it showed. I felt fully invested in the characters and its portrayal of fatherhood underscored how impactful parent/child relationships are. Kim Da-Mi as the FL was a show stealer and her sociopathic tendencies kept things fresh. \n\nHonorable Mention: Imitation: This is an idol drama that isn\u2019t as crisp as the dramas above, but I think it\u2019s important to call out the sickness that has permeated the k-pop world from the horrific way trainees are treated by management to the toxic way fans interact with idols. Look no further than fans parking a truck outside Lee Seung-Gi\u2019s house telling him not to get married to know there are some boundary issues. Lee Jun-Young plays a ML idol star in this and Let Me Be Your Knight and dude can act, sing, and boy can he dance.",

            "comment": "I am a slice-of-life, friendship-centred fan, so my faves reflect this:\n\n1. **Our Beloved Summer** - They did the enemies to lovers trope well and watching the characters grow and face their own insecurities and flaws was something I enjoyed\n2. **Reply 1988** - I cried at the end of this kdrama because I was so sad to see it come to an end. I got attached to and rooted for each and every character. Funny, heart-warming with a tinge of heart break, this drama had me wanting to be part of a group of friends I could grow up with. \n3.  **Thirty-nine** - This was heart wrenchingly good. The chemistry between Jeon MiDo and Son YeJin was better than with their male counterparts, so if you\u2019re into dramas that focus on friendships, this one is a good watch. \n4. **My Liberation Notes** - 3 siblings that live in the outskirts of Seoul try to seek happiness and the liberation that may accompany it. \n5. **Hospital Playlist Ss1** - this drama had so many LOL moments. It was hilarious and fun to watch and the leads were so loveable, especially Jeon MiDo \n6. **Sweet Home** - based on a webtoon by Carnby Kim, where humans succumb to their desires and turn into monsters. A personal favourite because it questions where the line between being a monster and human is. \n7. **Extracurricular** - The acting was good and the storyline was something I didn\u2019t think Koreans would ever even consider. ML is a quiet and shy high schooler who makes ends meet by being a pimp. Everything was going great until rich FL with abusive parents and the police get involved. \n8. **Twenty Five Twenty One** - This kdrama is cute, funny and takes us on a journey of a ML and FL trying to achieve their dreams. Kim Taeri\u2019s character is clumsy, funny, passionate and full of heart, so extremely loveable. I\u2019m still mad at how it ended though. I was in tears when I realised I wouldn\u2019t get my happy ending.\n9. **Flower of Evil** - This kdrama had me at the edge of my seat. The acting, the drama, the twists and turns *chef\u2019s kiss* \n10. **Hello My Twenties** - in my top 10 because it has a special place in my heart. The first kdrama I watched. All leads were women and the drama centred around their lives and them living together",

            "comment": "In no particular order:\n\nVincenzo: the first drama that actually got me into KDramas. It also has a ton of things I love, action, comedy, romance, a really cool ML, power couple/partners in crime, large cast, found family, just all the things, not sure if I\u2019ll ever find something quite like it. \n\nMy Shy Boss/Introverted Boss: I have a bit anxiety and how this show portrayed it was just so painfully relatable, loved the way they ended it without forcing the ML to step into the spotlight and suddenly not have any problems with social interaction. Liked the large (even if I hated the SML with a burning passion for a good two thirds of the drama) liked the comedy and tragedy mixed together, enjoyed all the various reveals and the way the ML was watching over and helping people all along and eventually got some good friends along with a romantic interest, also enjoyed how nice and cheerful the FL was. All in all it\u2019s not a perfect drama but it is very near and dear to my heart. \n\nHealer: the action was cool the couple was cute the secret identity and various reveals were fun and interesting. Funny and heartwarming and has a bit of a gut punch at certain moments and over all just a really good show. A classic for a reason. \n\nFlower of Evil: interesting from the get go. Never a dull moment, love married couples and the little girl was adorable. Lee Joon Gi did an amazing job at acting and at making you question weather or not he was a psychopath/murder and yet still making you root for him while also kinda rooting for his wife to arrest him and over all pulled at all my heartstrings. \n\nDoom At Your Service: Funny, tragic, thought provoking, heartwarming, all the things. Loved the way the main couple were super open about any romantic feelings from the get go instead of dancing around each other. One of my favorite FLs she\u2019s emotionally strong and selfless. It\u2019s visually beautiful. Really appreciated the lack of misunderstandings/fights between the main couple. Didn\u2019t super enjoy the love triangle for the second couple but I will forgive it since it means there wasn\u2019t one for the main couple. Also loved the supporting cast especially the FL\u2019s family and how the ML was slowly absorbed into it. Also Breaking Down was the first song that made me start to notice and appreciate KDrama soundtracks. \n\nIt\u2019s Okay To Not Be Okay: Visually appealing. Appreciated the fairytale vibe. Thought the FL was fun and interesting. Liked the relationships between the characters. (Also music)\n\n18 Again: again, married couple, heartwarming, funny. My favorite part has got to be the dad\u2019s relationship with his kids and how he always looks after them. Also a great representation of why I prefer Korean entertainment to American. \n\nTwo Weeks: I wasn\u2019t expecting much from this drama which might be a big part of why I ended up liking it so much. I like action. I like parent child relationships. I like characters going on the run. I liked the ML and actor that played him. Really liked the little side plots of the ML helping various people and vis versa. Was a bit disappointed in how the romance ended but overall I just really enjoyed the drama. \n\nJust Between Lovers/Rain or Shine: no humor, no action, no fantasy, no bad guy, no mystery. None of the tropes that I normally go for. Why did I like this so much? I don\u2019t know. I love the ML the whole rough around the edge with a heart of gold thing, liked how he took care of the people around him, his relationship with his best friend was nice.I liked the vibe, I liked the way things seemed to just keep getting worse but still somehow managed to end on a hopeful note. I really liked the main couple together, probably the only couple that can be described a \u2018so realistic\u2019 that really enjoyed and shipped. \n\nSweet Home: I\u2019m annoyed at how it ended/how long it\u2019s taking to get a second season (at the same time the actor of the main character is going to military (I think) and I don\u2019t want a second season that doesn\u2019t have him in it) I\u2019m sad that most of my favorite characters are dead. But really liked a lot of the characters dead though they may be, really felt for the main character, really shipped quite a few couples. The visuals were cool, liked how it wasn\u2019t a zombie show and how each monster clearly had a story/desire behind it and you take guesses at what those stories were. Liked how the story starts with the main character ready to die and then he found reasons to live in the apocalypse, liked the found family and kept me hooked from episode 1. Also the music, Side by Side has been added to two of my Spotify playlists. \n\n\nHope I didn\u2019t ramble too much but yeah these are the first ones that I could think of and I will probably remember one that I loved to death as soon as I post this.",

The revenge plot and the way the MC crafted it was so *beautiful.* The poetic justice was real. \n\n**D. P** - highlighting ongoing issues in the military and its effects on the victim was done right. The tone of the drama is quite heavy, and the ending was depressing. All the actors did a great job, especially the actor who played the role of the one soldier at the end of the arc (I forgot his name, unfortunately) \n\n**Extraordinary Attorney Woo** - I love this to the moon and back. It has such a good balance of wholesome and tragic things, and I'm here for it. \n\n**Taxi Driver** - I like episodic storylines, and this one has the perfect mix of comedy, action, romance, and mystery \n\n**Reply 1988** - such a comfort series. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what I like about this, but it feels so relatable somehow \n\n**Heavenly Idol** - I'm not a huge fan of romance or  dramas that involve showbiz since I'm usually leaning towards action but I watched this because of Kim Min Gue, and I stayed for the comedy. \n\nThe romance is pretty cute, too. I wouldn't necessarily say it has the best ending or that good of a story, but nevertheless, it was an enjoyable watch for 2023. \n\n**CLOY** - Watch it. There is Hyun Bin, and that's all you need to know, lol. I loved him since The Negotiation and I stayed for his and Son Ye Jin's chemistry. \n\n**Hometown Cha Cha Cha** - I don't think I need to be explaining since this is pretty much something you'll have to watch to know how it feels because the emotions are on point. It's so beautiful ngl \n\nWell, that's it. **Special mentions to like Weightlifting Fairy, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, Twenty-Five Twenty-One, Itaewon Class, Hospital Playlist, Prison Playbook, Reborn Rich, True Beauty (because comedy), Mr Queen, SKY Castle Gauss Electronics, Hot Stove League, Move To Heaven etc.**\n\nI usually lean more towards action series or series that portrays serious real-world issues that need immediate action, so I didn't want to list them all out and switched to the ones that have other genres for a fluid response from my side. The above ones are really enjoyable imo",

I've noticed that apparently at the moment I prefer shows without romance, maybe because of how friendship/family relationships develop and are portrayed.\n\n\n**Mr Queen** this really stands in a league of its own. I got confused by the palace politics and the 2 men who looked so similar, but overall a fantastic show. I find myself quoting this in random scenarios all the time. \n\n\n**Navillera** forever grateful for reading somebody else's recommendation request thread and discovering this. Such a beautiful, bittersweet and well done drama.\n\n\n**Would You Like a Cup of Coffee?** such a peaceful, sweet drama. Not much happens, the episodes are shorter and the plot is not wild or dramatic, but this turned out to be a comforting, destress watch for me.\n\n\n**The Fiery Priest** another drama that is unbelievably well done. The perfect blend of action and silliness with a fast-moving plot. I am impatient for season 2 and hope it will bring more viewers to this masterpiece.\n\n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** this drama completely sucked me in from the first trailer. It's so well balanced and the bromance trio will forever have a place in my heart. Another one that has a more peaceful vibe despite the sometimes distressing subjects. Even the ML actor said he regretted only making 12 episodes, I would welcome another season.",

There's nothing like it -&gt;!a love story disguised as a crime thriller, hidden identity, angsty romance. This drama has everything I look for in a drama  !&lt;\n3. Love struck in the City - not everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoy the mockumentary format and a love sick JCW running g around Seoul searching for the woman who broke his heart.\n4. Scent of a Woman - another sad, seemingly impossible love story\n5. Healer - Secret identity, JCW doing parkour, a cold case &gt;! Solved by the children of the victims, the regular people taking down the powerful trying to control their livesl!&lt; \n6. My Mister - just a very beautiful, healing drama. I could have watched 20 more episodes of IU and Lee Sun-kyun together\n7. Crash Landing on You - This is one where you can't help but fall in love with the entire cast of characters. Such a wonderful blend of sadness and humor. Another great OST.\n8. Coffee Prince - Gong Yoo falling in love angstily again. Yes please!\n9. Scarlet Heart: Ryeo - This one ripped my heart to shreds and definitely has some clumsy execution of story plotting and characterization....but I loved all of it despite its flaws. And who can resist a masked (anti)hero?\n10. Hometown Cha Cha Cha - depending on my mood, Romance is a Bonus book or Business Proposal would also go here. Nice fluffy dramas to rewatch when something lighter is needed.",

Enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. It may fall off my list eventually, but it's still fresh in my mind. \n* *Crash Landing on You* \\_ A good all-round drama. Perfect for newbies. \n* *Dear My Friends* \\- I love when older seasoned actors are the focus. Beautiful story. \n* *Hospital Playlist 1 &amp; 2* \\- My standard for a slice-of-life drama. Love the characters so much. \n* *Misaeng: Incomplete Life* \\- Mainly for my discovery of Lee Sung-Min. He is so good! \n* *Move to Heaven* \\- Good use of Lee Je-Hoon. \n* *Navillera* \\- Beautiful story of humanity that's true to life. \n* *Our Blues* \\- So many wonderful things about this. Awesome awesome actors! \n* *Prison Playbook* \\- My first exposure to a serious drama that didn't need romance. \n* *Start-Up* \\- Got caught up in the start-up story. \n* *Stranger 1*.  My second drama. Everything was still new and I loved it. \n* *Under the Queen's Umbrella* \\- My first historical drama. Enjoyed the pageantry very much.\n\nI'm 4 episodes away from finishing *Mr. Sunshine* and I'm at a point where the violence and bloodshed are at a peak. That's a turn-off for me. I feel l like this should make my list but it depends on how the remaining episodes turn out. Hoping I've seen the worst.",

Watch part one when I want something fun and light.\n\n**Encounter**. Just love the progressing of this romance.\n\n**Chocolate**. This is so much easier on rewatches as we know how it ends. She must be one of the bravest FL. Love both actors.\n\n**One Spring Night**. A mature and realistic romance.\n\n**Secret Garden**. Came to this only a couple of years ago. Although dated, the chemistry between the leads is exceptional. One of the best secondary couple storyline too. My go to show when I need a pick me up. \n\n**Crash Landing on you**. This is just a classic. Great acting, great story and some of the saddest scenes.\n\n**Hometown Cha Cha Cha**. Light, funny, mature romance. Great location.\n\n**Mother**. Best show about good and bad mothering. Lots of tears.\n\n**Thirty Nine**. Heartwarming story of female friendship and loyalty. Great acting too.\n\n**Dali and the Cocky Prince**. Just plain fun. Devoted, mature love.",

Spectacular acting all across the board. \n\nCrash landing on you - The first Kdrama I watched and one that will always at the top of my suggestion list to newbie watchers. If I could get sucked down Kdrama land with this drama, most other viewers can too.\n\nKingdom - A saeguk with zombies. Scratch that, the best kdrama featuring zombies. Period. \n\nTrue beauty - Funny, romantic and downright silly. This is a true pick me up when I\u2019m down in the dumps. \n\nBeyond evil - A crime story done right in my book. And just the most fantastic acting by SHK. \n\nArthdal Chronicles - I don\u2019t know why I waited so long to watch this. It\u2019s everything I like in a period fantasy drama. Plus what a fantastic cast. \n\nStrong woman Do Bong Soon - The Kdrama that made me want to learn Korean. Not to mention the cuteness of Min Min and Bong Bong. \n\nVincenzo - My favourite law Kdrama with one the best ensemble casts ever. \n\nDr. Romantic - One of the best medical drama\u2019s I\u2019ve seen so far and I have watched a lot. This one always tops the list because it\u2019s gritty yet heartwarming. It\u2019s serious yet funny. And it has the best cast. \n\nHometown Cha Cha Cha - Laid back slice of life drama that made me wish I had dimples too. \n\nHonourable mention \n\nThe Devil Judge - I absolutely loved the premise of this show and it was always great to see the devil judge pronouncing the verdicts. \n\nYumi\u2019s cells - The live action animation transitions were so smooth and the cells were so so relatable. I loved Yumi and her cells.\n\nWhen the weather is fine - Everything about this show is beautiful, the pace, the scenery, the book shop, the coffee and the lead couple.\n\nThe Glory - I had chills run down my spine while watching some scenes in this drama. Brutal and horrifying, it made me want to reach into my screen and punch some of those characters.",

The whole cast is amazing. Their story arcs are incredible. \n\n*Goblin*: This was my first drama and has been a gold standard for dramas I\u2019ve watched over the years. OST, cinematography, acting, they\u2019re all perfect. \n\n*Chicago Typewriter*: This drama is massively underrated. For me, it\u2019s a masterpiece. The romance and bromance are off the charts. Yoo Ah-in is hypnotizing in this role in 1930 and 2017. \n\n*Mr. Sunshine*: Guns. Glory. Sad endings. \n\n*25 21*: Kim Tae-ri is phenomenal in this one. You\u2019ll find yourself rooting for Na Hee-do.\n\n*My Mister*: The only drama I recommended to an elderly who\u2019s not even into dramas. And they find it amazing. This tells you how universal the themes in this drama are. \n\n*Coffee Prince*: \u201cI love you and I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re an alien.\u201d Coffee Prince aged like fine wine and was so ahead of its time. OSTs are magical. Yoon Eun-Hye\u2019s acting is phenomenal. \n\n*Hospital Playlist*: Mido and Falasol. Need I say more? \n\n*Flower of Evil*: Lee Joon-gi\u2019s acting alone puts this drama in my top 10. \n\n*Red Sleeve*: Powerful acting of Seong Deok-him and Yi San. They do not need to say much to express their feelings.",

Friendship, slow burn love, medical issues and music - HP has it all.\n\n**2. Reply 1988** -another amazing Shin-Lee slice-of-life drama. It starts growing on you after the 2nd episode, and then you can\u2019t stop watching it. Also set-up around a group of 5 friends and their families; also very wholesome.\n\n**3. CLOY** - I don\u2019t think I need to explain myself here, right?\n\n**4. 25-21** - I love sports dramas, and Kim Tae-Ri is amazing in it. I know the ending is controversial, but I really liked it.\n\n**5. While you were sleeping** - one of the first dramas I ever watched and one that got me hooked from episode one. I love the characters development and how they solve the criminal cases.\n\n**6. Mr Sunshine** - my first period drama, and one that I loved from start to end. \n\n**7. All of us are dead** - coming of age meets zombie apocalypse - what is not to like?!\n\n**8. Start-up** - I\u2019m surprised this didn\u2019t come up in the lists above. Although the SML may be a bit annoying, I really liked the story and characters development in this series.\n\n**9. Prison Playbook** - I\u2019m a fan of Shin-Lee\u2019s work, so this one has to be on my list. \n\n**10. DP** - amazing acting. Short but very intense.",

For example, one of my favorite movies of all time is Bringing Up Baby.  I\u2019m also a fan of Hitchcock films.  Having this tone spread across 16 episodes is pure pleasure and I\u2019m so grateful to the hardworking set people, actors, directors and writers who make this happen.  For those of you who love classic cinema, please enjoy this list.  The first five are madcap comedies, and the last five are suspense:\n\n1.  Best Love\n\n2. Spring Turns to Spring\n\n3.

Everything about it is perfect to me. Story, acting, direction, music, epic nature, spiritual truths (ex - we are here to give and share joy in response for the love that we receive), romance. It's one long lyrical poem and it speaks to me.\n2. **Healer** \\- Also perfect, in my eyes. Quest for Truth and Integrity, romance, amazing action sequences, comedy, actors,. Ok, the music is sometimes cheesy, but it's still wonderful from the opening strains to the ajuma. I love it.\n3. **Encounter**\\- I love this one. It's also like a lyrical poem that depicts a beautiful romance showing kind, people. The music and art direction and the actors are beautiful.\n4. And now - I'm going to list the other 2 in my Top Five and proceed to add a few newer ones to my list.  **Coffee Prince** \\- This has aged well and remains a joy to watch. M**y Love from the Star:**  \\- This is also a \"classic\" for me and is also perfect in every way.\n5. **Mama Fairy and the Woodcutter** \\- This is magical, funny, engaging, romantic, and is just plain fun. I love this!\n6. **Hospital Playlist  1 and 2**. I like the second season even more, but all of it is perfect. It's my current obsession and I love it. It's a \"slice of life\" in hospital setting. The characters are wonderful: 5 surgeons who've been friends for 20 years and went to medical school together. They now work in the same hospital. Each one is so kind, expert in their field, and heart-centered. Their friendship is amazing - and they have a band and play wonderful music. I can't get enough of it.\n7. **Gu Family Book -** Just finished a rewatch of this and it stands up to its 10/10 rating. Epic, magical, heart-warming, romantic, with action and colorful costumes, good music.\n8. **Hometown Cha Cha Cha -** A healing drama for me. Deals with friendship, multi-generational relationships with kindness and humor. Pretty near perfect.\n9. **The King Eternal Monarch**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it for now!\n\nThis year I've really loved **Curtain Call, The Golden Spoon, and Crash Course in Romance**. Just saying....   I'm enjoying **The Good Bad Mother.**",

So i just decided to rate stuff like this; if i can say 10 things i like it's a 100, then i take one point away for stuff i didn't like or wish happened different or something. But then again, i sometimes like stuff that has more faults more than stuff that have less faults... rating will stay a mystery to me i guess xD. Also, this list will probably change fast again, my watchlist has more than 250 shows...\n\nhttps://mydramalist.com/dramalist/marblebees",

People vary / different strokes for different folks, etc. \n\nMy favorite is when people have listed 2+ of my top ten and have shows I 'hate watched' or dropped. It's fascinating to me. \n\nI used to read them to add shows to my watch list but I've been watching for long enough that there are no more shows to add. \n\nAnyway, don't be sad - you do you. My top ten would be quite different from anyone else's but it's cool by me.",

            "comment": "Here's my top 10 of most underrated/unappreciated/misunderstood dramas that I rarely see mentioned on the sub or if I do, I think the assessments are unfairly negative:\n\n1. **Liar game** \\- best jdrama adaptation I've seen in a kdrama, super unique in a way most kdramas are not (game theory hijinks!) but very korean despite the ultra-japanese original, EXCELLENT acting, EXCELLENT casting, EXCELLENT cinematography and the pacing and plotting was tighter than any other kdrama I've ever seen. This was the one show where I literally waited all week to see it and then made myself and my roommate drinks and charcuteries before sitting down to watch it and discuss it after. I'm normally a very passive kdrama watcher - watch before bed or when I'm sick/on a break from work but I watched this the day before a major exam and still made time because I loved it so much.\n2. **The Pied Piper** \\- same pd/writer team as Liar Game, didn't quite reach the same level of genius but as a mystery/thriller it topped squid game, signal, the glory etc. for me. Another show with superlative casting and acting and it actually kept you in suspense for a lot of the show, excellent 'grey' villains and protagonists, nothing was overly obvious or trope-infested.\n3. **The Producers** \\- really the first office-style docu-drama I can remember korea putting out. Comedy was top notch and so were the acting performances in emotional moments. Touched on a lot of really interesting social and industry issues surrounding drama, idol culture, etc. First time IU really shone as an actress, male lead more of a chungmuro actor but he came through in this in a big way. It was just so fun and zany in a really understated, human way.\n4. **What's Up!** \\- First totally preproduced drama I remember watching. I  am a professional musician and this may be the only musical drama I feel really did the music part of the drama justice (honorable mentions for **Monstar, Heartstrings** which did some things very right, **Do You Like Brahms** and **a Piece Of Your Mind** were good/faithful depictions of classical musicians but weren't really 'music dramas' per se). This drama casted musical actors who could both sing and act, had a shorter runtime which kept the plot really tight, and honestly launched quite a few people's careers (Lim Ju-Hwan, Kim Ji Won, Jo Jung Seok) who are now kdrama staples. It also had a really perfect mix of comedy/tragedy/romance/friendship which I found extremely emotionally engaging.\n5. **Hogu's Love/Fool's Love** \\- early TVN romcom with a shorter runtime. Basically the first serious lead role of Choi Woo Sik. This was a high school/youth romcom which normally don't grab me much but there was something really heartfelt, nostalgic, affecting and sweet about this drama (along with lots of comedy) that made it stick with me as one of the best romcoms I've ever seen. One of the first dramas to use gradual flashbacks to heartwrenching effect. Because it was one of the first 'shorter' dramas I feel like they managed to keep unnecessary tropes to a minimum and delivered only the 'heart' of the story without any evil or frustrating characters or twists.\n6. **SKY Castle** \\- this is here not because it wasn't popular but because I feel it was grossly misunderstood. This was a black comedy and I think it has been characterized (wrongly) as a makjang. The strength of this show is that it was intensely, rolling on the floor laughing funny but I think a lot of people missed this. Amazing use of music and sound cues especially the bolero soundtrack music.\n7. **Manhole** \\- I remember this drama was intensely hated when it aired and I rarely if ever see it mentioned now but it may be one of the most riotously fun dramas I've ever watched. It has time loop, murder mystery, romance, friendship and everything but in a very fun and unique way but I think the real strength of this show was in exploring the part of time travel plots I think most time travel dramas get wrong - exploring how the main character changes or doesn't change through all the iterations of time travel in a very realistic way. Bonus points for exploring 'alternative' lovelines and how they would (or would not) have occurred. Cinematography and settings were really bright and engaging. I think the reason people didn't like it is because the time loop was a bit 'messy' in its mechanics but personally I felt this didn't detract from the show and the show was self-aware about it. Or alternatively because people didn't have the patience for the gradual character development but the payoff was very rewarding and felt true to life.\n8. **Avengers Social Club** \\- one of the best dramas I've ever seen EVER (top five) but I think it was overlooked because it didn't have romance mystery etc. This was a show about female friendship, second chances, family love and forgiveness. It threw a lot of 'revenge drama' tropes on their head and had some of the most gutwrenchingly beautiful friendship scenes I've ever seen in a drama. VERY funny also but don't bother if you need explicit romance or other 'tropes' since this drama throws all that in the garbage. If you're just looking for a solidly GOOD show that will make you cry buckets of tears and fall out of your bed laughing this is it though. I put this lower on the list only because I think it doesn't have a lot of the things that appeal to people in kdrama (romance, etc), otherwise it would be higher.\n9. **On The Way To The Airport** \\- best melodrama I have ever watched with the best/most affecting chemistry and acting. Literally them touching hands did more for me than the most amazing onscreen kisses in other shows. I know this one is unpopular because it tackled cheating on multiple levels, had long periods of nothing obviously happening plotwise etc. but if you're into psychodrama and 'second chances' types of plots I think this is a good one to watch. A really good exploration of what freedom really means, mentally and emotionally, and what healthy relationships should really be like.\n10. **Missing Noir M** \\- second best crime procedural to come out of korea for me (after God's Quiz but this is really popular). I never see anyone mention this one but it's on a level for me with British and Nordic shows in terms of grit/vibe/acting and plot. Not much to say except it is really solid as a crime drama and really unpredictable (not all cases last the same number of episodes, etc). I feel the procedural is a lost art in kdrama as they're going for serialized shows now.\n\n(continued below)",

            "comment": "Top 10 Sageuk Dramas (in my opinion)\n1. Empress Ki\n-Even though it's not 100% historically accurate, this 51 episode drama shows the complexity of human relationships and emotions. Even though it's a long show, almost every episodes was worth watching. \n2. The Red Sleeve\n-Wow! I don't want to spoil anything but the love story really captured my heart. Also the social commentary was well done too.\n3. Mr. Queen\n-Hilarious. A perfect blend of modernity and sageuk. The acting is on point too. \n4. The Crowned Clown\n-Dramas honestly rarely makes me cry, but Yeo Jin-goo's performances as two different characters was heart wrenching. This isn't higher up however because some episodes felt very slow and I wish they kept the two characters longer. The acting and OST is superb.\n5. The Tale of Nokdu\n-The acting and story was really intriguing. I remember really liking this kdrama-- I even gave it 10/10 on MDL. But beyond some major plot points, it doesn't really stick in my memory. I'd still recommend it.\n6. Our Blooming Youth \n-Honestly this was the first a \"woman serves king while dressing as a eunuch\" drama I have seen that actually worked in my opinion. The romance is very slow burn and it's actually quite nice that it does not distract from the mystery most of the show. However the viewers figure out the mystery way before the characters, making it a bit frustrating to watch. The end is very sweet though and I recommend.\n7. Hwarang\n-Half the wooga squad stars in this show (Army, it's the only show with a BTS member) and I could definitely tell part of the point was to be eye candy. On the other hand, their acting was legitimately great. The FL was kind of disappointing, however, and I remember not 100% liking the romance. The show was enjoyable overall though. \n8. River Where the Moon Rises \n-Despite challenges with changing the ML actor halfway through the show, I think this drama was quite well done. It had great characters and good \"girl boss\" energy... until about halfway through when the FL becomes a bit obnoxious. By the end though, it is forgivable and it is a generally good show.\n9. 100 Days My Prince \n-I loved this show. It was my first saguek drama. However it does slow a lot halfway through and it can be sluggish for some. I loved the chemistry of the two actors and I think overall it is an endearing drama.\n10. Moon Lovers \n-Okay... this is mostly #10 because it's so well loved. I however find it a bit overrated. The ML is kind of unbearable most of the show and I just could never bring myself to fully like him. I understood his character but I didn't think he was really healthy enough for the FL to be with. IU is wonderful in this show. She shows a lot of emotional elasticity as an actress, making her performance the highlight of this show for me.",

Bc of grandma death and headaches?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The teen versions of each boy turned into the adult versions of each other when they grew up? What in the world?!&lt;\n\nLol this drama was so disappointing. It had the potential to be great but then everything fell short/nothing felt properly developed. \n\nI give it a 6/10.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact that it was only 8 eps is no excuse, bc i started watching one day off where each ep is like a self-contained short film and it has been so satisfying! So this could have been much better.",

It was Yoo and not Junhee as the doctor all this time cause the actors playing the adult versions seemed to be like cross-matched. The actor playing adult Yoo looked more like teen Junhee and also the personality matched with him.",

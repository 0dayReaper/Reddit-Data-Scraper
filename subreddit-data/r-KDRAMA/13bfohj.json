I\u2019m on the fence with ML and his low key stalking tendencies, but I like the show and will keep watching. \nOn another side note: Why do I have to go to work, I want to stay in bed all day and binge this.

I don't want to give away too many details because you really need to go into this drama unspoiled but it's honestly one of the most brilliant shows I've ever seen in any language. It feels more like an independent film than a drama. The creators did a lot of work to appease Chinese censors while still letting the audience know what really happens in the narrative. It's free on YouTube and everyone should watch it honestly, it's that good. If you're a fan of **Beyond Evil** you'll love this one.",

It doesn't appear it will have the romance (cause he's madly in love with his wife but she's not in this one), but for him, I think it's worth it for you. He's super funny in this one!

Essentially, the opinion piece argues that adaptations of Korean cinema, both those that have already happened and those rumored to be in the works in 2021, suffer from even more than usual white washing. \n\nOne of the potential remakes mentioned was of **Crash Landing on You**, with the author pointing out (imo rightly) that a remake set in America would per force not have nearly the same cultural impact of the show originally set in a divided Korea. \n\nIt reminded me a little of when **The Departed** cribbed its overall plot structure from the Chinese movie **Infernal Affairs** (when I saw The Departed in theaters, I was laughing at myself for knowing all the plot twists before hand), but managed to translate the distinctly Chinese setting into one that was distinctly American. \n\nSo while I don't want to see what the current climate would do with an American remake of CLOY, I had a couple thoughts: what if they set it in Berlin during the Cold War, when the city was split by a wall? That could be epic! \n\nWhat if they set it in the American South during the Civil rights Era? **Lovecraft Country** did something similar and was incredibly effective. \n\nI know the article is old but just food for discussion!",

I'm also really looking forward to character growth from the ML's Noona. There's something vulnerable about her that I can't take her pettiness or anger seriously. Maybe it's because I really like her husband and it's so obvious they're still in love. \n\nFinally watched **Witch's Diner** and I wish I stuck it out when it first premiered so that I could have been apart of the discussion. The bullying scenes were too much for me (still were) so I dropped the drama. This time I fast forwarded through them, and realized there's a great drama outside of that plot. I went back and took a look at the discussion and one thing that stuck out is Nam Ji Hyun always playing Nam Ji Hyun. I've only finished 2 of her dramas (365 and Witch's Diner) and I felt they were different enough but now I'm curious and want to rewatch some of her dramas I never finished.\n\nExcited for **Perfect Stranger** and **True to Love** this week.",

Highly recommend, but be aware it's very gritty. \n\nI also watched **3 AM** on Viki, a Maylasian horror anthology, solid watch. Not all of them were great, but some good ones in there. \n\nCaught up on my Thai BL's as well, but nothing I would recommend right now. This year's Thai BL trend seems to be office romance and not overly into it. Although **House of Stars** makjang vibes and looks ridiculous, but only one episode so far.",

This is why I don't watch longform that often. \n\nOne thing I absolutely love about these family dramas, though, is the peek into Korean culture as it works within families. This drama taught me a lot about in-law dynamics, the internal family hierarchy, and why double-marriage connections are Bad. Not things I've picked up on in other dramas. \n\nOverall, I would recommend! I felt like **My Father is Strange** had more well-balanced character arcs (and still has my all-time favorite couple). But this one has cute kids, a nice mature lead romance, Shin Hye Sun, several genuinely funny moments, and some amazing parent characters with great big hearts and realistic flaws (I could see bits of my own grandmother in one of them, which endeared her to me even when her choices drove me crazy). Check it out if you're looking for something long and wholesome.",

Healer I think is everyone's favorite/ his best role. I rate Lovestruck at number 2, but it is filmed mockumentary style, so some people didn't really care for it. Also the FL is a bit immature emotionally, but I found the whole drama t be endearing. Empress Ki is a historic drama where JCW plays a spoiled brat Emperor. I found it hilarious. But the drama is looong (51 episodes - I have 13 left) and it has a lot of court politics, but you see his character  mature which is rewarding. THe K2 is a low rent version of Healer, but incredibly fun to watch regardless. Backstreet Rookie is enjoyable, but there are some problematic elements, such as the age difference between JCW and the FL, and a supporting character can be considered a racist portrayal of rasta culture (this is debatable, I leave it up to you.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNest of his on my list are older: My Two Perfect Sons, Hero and Warrior Baek Dong Soo, which I have heard are all good, but he is only a lead in Warrior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I would watch Healer and The K2 net if you haven't already.",

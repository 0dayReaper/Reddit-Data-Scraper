It also affects the kind of roles they get offered. No romcoms for a married actress or even worse a mom. \n\nMale actors often have fanbases who will throw a tantrum. I'm reminding of Kwon Sang-woo for example.\n\nSo yeah big impact on their brand value and career trajectory. \n\nThankfully things are getting a bit better.",

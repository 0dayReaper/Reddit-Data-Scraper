But her relatively uneventful life is turned upside down when she is unexpectedly reunited with her ex-husband \u2013 in the law courts! The duo is forced to work together \u2013 leading them to butt heads and reignite past grievances. While their professionalism prevents them from telling each other what they really think in public, tempers begin to fray...and risk boiling over. The tense atmosphere is not relieved in the slightest by fellow divorce lawyers Kang Bi Chwi and Kwon Si Wook, another pair of advocates who always seem to get under one another\u2019s skin! Will Cupid rescue this group of lawyers \u2013 or will chaos break loose in the courtroom?\n* **Previous Discussion:** [\\[Episodes 1 &amp; 2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10eukmf/can_we_be_strangers_episodes_1_2/)  [\\[Episodes 3 &amp; 4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10kwthh/can_we_be_strangers_episodes_3_4/) [\\[Episodes 5 &amp; 6\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10qd222/can_we_be_strangers_episodes_5_6/) [\\[Episodes 7 &amp; 8\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10wmqsy/can_we_be_strangers_episodes_7_8/)  [\\[Episodes 9 &amp; 10\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/112q69u/can_we_be_strangers_episodes_9_10/)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [\\[Reddiquette\\]](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [\\[Conduct Rules\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [\\[Policies\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [\\[When Discussions Get Personal\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/)\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behaviour will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

Relationships are complex. We bring our trauma, our conceived notions &amp; values, and our communication styles into relationships. At best, we\u2019re able to reflect on ourselves and find ways to healthily communicate. But that\u2019s far easier said than done.\n\nEach of characters have slowly chipped away at their development. Some more than others. Each \u2018case of the week\u2019 has (albeit heavy handedly) mirrored what the main cast is facing at the time. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a clear cut happy ending here. And that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve left this show with some things to think about. So I\u2019m thankful to the writers and my fellow commenters.",

But I thought that the newly found understanding between him and his mom would heal those wounds. Also the therapy would help him be more at ease with himself. There was ground being laid for possible change or at least communication. Baby or not, the speech given at the \u201cwedding\u201d celebration talked about the difficulties of love. So I thought the show was leading up to a realization that love IS difficult. You may have all your ducks in perfect row with someone but is that who you should marry? EB and HR not only had love but they had passion. That is not a combo you come across all the time and should be embraced. I thought these were the underlying thoughts that were being developed and  where the show was heading. As a rom com we should have been able to see a \u201cwe\u2019re smarter now so let\u2019s try again \u201c scene at the end. \nI really enjoyed the other couple though! It was funny and had moments of depth too. (Now that\u2019s a rom com!) I thought it was very romantic when he said he\u2019d be the stay-at-home dad and was cheering her on to pursue her ambitions.",

But they\u2019re still in the cycle of becoming strangers and coming back to each other. \n\nI've been disappointed or felt meh about an ending a number of times within the past year so I guess this one didn\u2019t piss me off or rip me to shreds. But the part of me that watches kdramas for happy endings, unrealistic happy, sappy love, all of that, the ending was not it. My first reaction after finishing the show was a smile on my face in a state of confusion and then a headshake saying uh uh \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d like what did I watch this for lol. I mean I think this drama is realistic but the writing also wasn\u2019t the best. Also why advertise this as a rom com?? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve watched a romcom that ends with the couple not being together \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe chemistry was good but we barely got any tbh. I would\u2019ve loved to see more flashbacks and present day scenes of the leads together (in a romantic way). The whole show is about them finding out if they can be strangers but something about a show going full circle to the way it started doesn\u2019t sit right with me. So we saw a snippet of their life and we have to use our imagination to decide how they'll end\u2026\n\nI\u2019m glad ML is getting therapy and at least Hara is being honest with herself. I wanna yell at ML for not saying the real reason he broke up with her and also not asking the lingering question at the end but it\u2019s in his true fashion \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I hope therapy works for him because what CEO Seo said was true, there\u2019s no paradise on the run. I don\u2019t know how he'll ever live a fulfilling life not saying how how he feels. If at least to one person it should be the love of his life \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI don't have much to say about the 2nd couple because honestly what?? \ud83d\ude02 Their story is a bit strange but whatever. \n\nI enjoyed watching this drama to an extent. The characters aren't perfect and it was kinda nice watching what they would do. On the other hand, with the way it ended it\u2019s frustrating knowing I spent 12 hours on a show that ended the same way it started. I don\u2019t know what to say \ud83d\ude2d",

Hopefully, we get more stuff like this, but ratings really do drive investment and future productions.\n\nEdit2: just watched the last two episodes. Rather frustrating tbh. Felt like the storyline was setting up for the leads &gt;!to overcome their issues in a more mature fashion as a couple. They showed personal growth in the end, but apparently that wasn't possible!&lt; in their relationship?\n\nI was off on my initial assessment that the characters &gt;! were developing in any meaningful way throughout thevfirst ten episodes. The second there was a serious conflict, EB completely reverted to the same character that literally lied about an affair so he didn't have to have an honest discussion. OHR wasn't decisive about her feelings regarding having kids which led to EB's insecurities This time it was about misinterpreting a phone call.!&lt; Like OHR told the boss, it wouldn't be fair to only get her side of the story...\n\nThe setup was there to deliver a great ending with both leads &gt;! growing as individuals and having that enabling a healthy relationship. Instead, the resolution is that they can't be together at all, and that there was an inherent incompatibility between the two!&lt;\n\nI was really hoping that this story would thread the line between realistic relationships and having it work out for the leads as a couple.

Glad that HaRa kinda freed herself from this blackhole and hope she will find another man to build a family she wanted with.\n\nI am in the minority that I didn't enjoy the SFL's story (do not like her). I am all for modern and independent woman but something about her (or her story) just don't connect with me.\n\nSome else has said it, HaRa is supposedly the star goddess lawyer of this law firm, but honestly it didn't feel like she's all that great. And if she's really that great, why would the CEO wants her to leave instead of EunBom? Isn't usually small company need a big star hotshot to attract customers? So weird.\n\nThe only good thing I got from this drama is that one OST sung in spanish.  Can't stop listening to it though I can't understand it without reading the English sub.",

            "comment": "**Overall thoughts**:\nEunbeom seems too much into his trauma to commit to further a relationship. His mutism/frustrating lack of communication seems to come from coping with his overbearing mother. While people have all sorts of reasons which are valid for not having kids, this feels too mixed up with his trauma. I was hoping it would be acknowledged at least once because that *is* what started this whole thing but I'd have to let it hang above my head forever now.\n\nHara seems to get the long end of the stick in this one, seeking closure, rekindling then seeking closure, the cycle.  \nThey've been together for so long but both inevitably grown separate.  \nFor me, the most consistent thing is both never stop loving each other but Eunbeom needs the space but also pushes people away, there isn't much Hara can do but move on (or wait, which they were hinting towards in the end).  \nI could see them working out if they didn't drag out the \"unable to talk\" problem they're *still having* by the end.\n\nThe show seems to end with the sentiment: how much can both love and problems dictate a relationship?  \nI hate that they did this so much.  \nI'm not sure I like that too many of these are minimally tackled and left open, as if a \"choose your ending\" kind of conclusion. Also of the positive outlook of their involvement in the afterstory, not to say it's for this way but it's **open** to it.  \nWhich reminds me of Bichwi and Shiwook who seem like lesser problematic and flip versions of the main couple. Bichwi was overcompensating by preconceived notions (gender expectations) that she's overly cautious of simple things in the way Eunbeom overcomplicates. I can see Hara (Shiwook) throwing away her pride and obnoxiously clingy to Eunbeom because she finally understands the full picture. This is one of those inserts.  \nBut how I actually feel about it: the same exact story is about to repeat again.  \nI enjoyed the show but the many-fold unresolved ending soured it.",

And the underlying divorce case resulted in a break up. So, thematically it feels like the writer is telling us they shouldn't be together. \n\n&gt;!It felt like a healthy break for Ha Ra. However, just like before - Eun Beom is not fully communicating with her and throwing himself basically on the pyre in a way he thinks will be healthier for her. I assume the last episode will deal with his closure (either way). Giving us his mother likely dying (or on her deathbed) is a bit of a last minute way to make him deal with his trauma, realize the shortness of life, and maybe realize he does want to be with Ha Ra. But it feels rough since we just had this beautiful moment of her finally deciding she's going to move on.!&lt;\n\nAnyway, I've enjoyed this show.

Like yes, Si Woo's initial take on basically every problem comes from ingrained assumptions about how life should be based on traditional values. But he has shown an incredibly willingness to break from that in almost every situation and the way that they as a couple resolve conflict has not developed. Like you forced my dude to disown his entire family just to prove a point and win the argument. If she can't voice her expectations up front and then work collaboratively then they're just going to repeat the cycle of him being stubborn and her breaking him down over and over again. Si Woo though, stop grabbing her that's not cool bro. \n\nThe main couple's story in episode 11 really stagnated because of a dumb misunderstanding. They set up the plot so that we could see how they would navigate their difference of opinion about having a baby and their futures, but instead it boiled down to absolutely no communication and a breakup that deviated from where the story had been heading. it seems like they're both too wrapped up in their own fears about the relationship failing so they both sabotaged it before it could fail because of the main issue. Like if neither of you **want** to break up then you should at least talk to each other and come to an agreement that there are reasons why you **should**. \n\nI guess the case this episode really exposed how none of the characters assume that their relationship is a collaborative effort. They all respond to conflict as individuals. \n\nAlso, the case couple were such ridiculously terrible people that it was almost comical. They were like cartoon villains.",

However, she did not force him to disown his family. He never communicated with her the full scope of the consequences if the baby didn't carry his name. Once she finds out, she says she's willing to compromise on it. \n\nBecause dealing with a man with a sexist upbringing is exhausting and it makes her question the amount of agency she can have. I find Bi Chwi's apprehension of the future very realistic. It's not that the baby had to take her name, it's simply that she opposed the idea that it had to be the opposite way because she is the woman. Which is the crux of her dilemma.\n\n She cares for Si Wook and wants to have the baby. That much is clear. But she doesn't want it at th expense of sacrificing her agency as a person just because she's a woman. So even the little stuff like a baby's last name becomes important for her. \n\nSi Wook's growth is nice to see, but you don't get cookie points from me because you learned how to treat women as equals in your thirties. Bi Chwi needs better conflict resolution skills, but her aggravation and fear\n are very, very, very justified\n\nAs for the case couple, i was just flabbergasted that there was no resolution on screen. We know they fought each other but that looked like domestic violence and it wasn't expounded on",

Generally, I enjoyed it well enough Ig.\n\nThere is **no way** anyone could ever convince me this was a healthy relationship, but I think the two leads having a tiny bit too much chemistry and charm could *almost* make you forget that fact so it felt kind of weird sometimes.\n\n&gt;!And to the writers' credit, they didn't shy away from pointing it out with EB actually seeking therapy (and not magically getting better because of one conversation with his mother for example) while HR on her part admits she's been stuck and wandering about. They can't get be together unless they figure out some real issues (especially the baby thing which really isn't a small matter) but they're both not in the right headspace personally to do so. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!So even though they had great chemistry, history, and clearly held some deep affection for each other, I feel watching them getting back together couldn't have been cathartic. There is no point to a relationship where both are bound to be unhappy. And honestly, if either of them had spoken their thoughts out loud at the end, I would have found it very selfish, because it'd practically force the other to wait for them to be ready. I mean, let's face it, if one had let it slip that they still held some tiny hope of getting back together one day, the other would have instantly jumped on the chance, reason be damned. I think Oh Hara in particular would have been hard done by if he had uttered the words out loud, pretty much shackling her to him. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Instead, seeing them take real steps to move forward, was a more satisfying ending in my opinion. The last scene imo was to show that maybe, if (but that's only an if) life turns out that way and they do cross paths again, then they will definitely be able to make it work so we don't need to worry about it being another repeat of this disaster. But even if it doesn't, it's still ok because it's heavily hinted that they'll still be in a better place than they are currently, and it's all thanks to the events depicted during the series. Their working together, bickering with each other, dating once more and breaking up once again, all of it forced them to finally face their own issues and endeavour to overcome them.  !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ofc, I can't say it was a full-on happy ending.  I don't think it was a cheap shock ending either, meant to add angst just for the sake of it, the series built up to that so it still felt organic.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!However, considering the hopefulness of this finale and the overall plotlines I can't say it was a 100% sad/unhappy one either. More of a bittersweet ending, leaning heavily into 'happy\", though not quite crossing over. Oddly enough, I think sometimes those are the ones that feel the more intense and emotional  (e.g. Cafe Midnight). !&lt;",

            "comment": "This is a rant about the things I disliked in the show:\n\n&gt;!  I felt like the SML and SFL's relationship was very underdeveloped. When did they fall in love?? Suddenly, this super badass independent career-driven feminist agreed to get married just because she's having a baby and they're exchanging ILYs but last time I checked, they were barely FWB, more like coworkers with benefits. At most, they were in lust with each other. Did they even have enough conversations to fall in love?? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The whole DINK discussion. ML and FML were married before, did they not discuss kids? Was EB just going along with the idea of having kids? Did he give up after they got divorced? After they get together, the discussion is brought up and I kept waiting for them to sit down and say \"here's why I want/don't want to have kids\" and then go through it together. It's not an easy decision to make, there are whole books about it to help couples choose. I didn't feel like either of them were really dead set on their decisions. It felt like FML wanted kids because that's what is expected of a woman and it felt like ML didn't want kids because he is scared of commitment.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why does CEO Seo have a job?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Unnecessary plots. What was the point of FML's dad storyline? Or CEO Seo's dog custody case? (I legit don't remember if they had any relevance).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!FML spent half the show dating someone else for no other reason than to realize she still loves ML, which she could have discovered simply by working with him again and seeing how much he cares for her.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!MLs inability to open his mouth.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I wish that instead of the show starting with ML and FML divorced and fighting, they were just separated and trying to work out their issues. Both of them in individual therapy (FML is kinda manipulative and very overbearing) and couple's therapy. And, once again, having genuine, in-depth discussions about having children. Maybe a pregnancy scare to show their reactions? Then wrapping it up with a resolution.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!he last episode was completely unnecessary. It took a good ending - Ha Ra definitely breaking up with Eun Beom - and ruined it by opening it while they're still incaple of having a conversation. Also what was that wedding with just the office???? Whose last name are they gonna use anyway?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The show starts with FML being on TV and ends with her going to a filming but where was that during all of the show?????!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Two instances of domestic violence not properly addressed. !&lt;\n\nRegardless of all that, I did really enjoy the show. It's refreshing to see an actual adult relationship being portrayed, especially outside of the honeymoon phase. The characters are written as very flawed people (I think only CEO Hong and the three paralegals have no obvious flaws?) and the drama shows how theses flaws affect their romantic relationships. They touched on important subjects, like having children and balancing a career, which is something we need to see more of in media in general (and not only with the childfree part agreeing to have kids in the end). I liked that not everything had a perfect solution and that the problems were more grey than black and white. Like I said in another comment, it's not a show I'll be recommending much, and definitely won't rewatch it, but it was entertaining following it week by week.",
